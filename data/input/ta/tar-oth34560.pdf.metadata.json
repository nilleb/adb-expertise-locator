INTRODUCTION\n1. The Pacific Strategy1 of the Asian Development Bank states that ADB will work with the\nPacific  developing  member  countries  (PDMCs)  to  utilize  information  and  communication\ntechnology  (ICT)  to  overcome  constraints  associated  with  smallness  and  isolation,  and  to\nrealize  potential  gains  offered  by  links  to  a  global  market.  In  fact,  natural  disadvantages,\nespecially  geographic  remoteness,  are  inconsequential  for  some  information-intensive\nindustries and, in some cases, time zone differences can be turned into an advantage.\n2. This  regional  technical  assistance  (TA)  seeks  to  assist  the  PDMC  governments  in\nassessing their ICT readiness, and to prepare the framework for ADB involvement in the sector.\nThe proposal was endorsed by the regional TA Screening Committee on 18 December 2000.2\nThe TA framework is in Appendix 1.\nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n3. The  rapid  globalization  of  the  knowledge-based  economy  presents  enormous\nopportunities and unique challenges for the role of ICT in accelerating growth, and reducing\npoverty by bridging the emerging digital divide. ICT in the PDMCs can transform old challenges\nand create unprecedented possibilities for sustainable economic development, just as it has for\nbusiness  in  the  industrial  world.  For  example,  exportable  service  jobs,  such  as  airline\nreservations or back-office processing, could be located in distant regions to provide 24-hour\ncoverage and to avoid night work.\n4. The  awareness  among  the  PDMCs  of  the  emerging  global  economy  and  of  ICT\u2019s\nstrategic role is growing fast. At the 13th South Pacific Forum in October 1999, the PDMCs\nleaders reiterated the critical importance of efficient and effective ICT services for economic and\nsocial development, and emphasized the need to promote competitive ICT markets. The Vision\nfor  a  Pacific  Information Economy  adopted  envisages  a  regional  community  in  which  the\nprocesses  of  work,  commerce,  learning,  education  and  training,  social  interaction,  and\ngovernment  are  facilitated  and  enhanced  by  ICT,  enabling  all  citizens  to  take  part  in\nopportunities brought by the global information economy.\n5. The PDMCs must be ready to take advantage of the additional opportunities brought by\nthe  global  market  and  the  new  economy.  The  advantages  of  ICT-readiness  include  the\nfollowing:\n(i)  Educating more people and supporting lifelong learning. Rewards to an\nindividual  for  an  educational  investment  include  more  employment  options,\nhigher income, and better future prospects. Education is also the best route to\nimproving the status of women. Finally, ICT pervades the economy and ICT\ntraining is an effective tool for the domestic market as well as for exports of jobs.\n(ii)  Making governments more efficient, accountable, and transparent. Public\nadministration  is  information  intensive.  Large  productivity  increases  in\ngovernment  services  are  possible  with  ICT:  ICT  increases  speed,  volume,\nquality, transparency, and accountability of transactions.\n                                                \n1  ADB. 2000. A Pacific Strategy for the New Millenium. Manila.\n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 17 November 2000.", "2\n(iii)  Reducing  the  cost  of  doing  business.  Cheaper  and  more  reliable\ncommunications  with,  and  information  on,  customers  and  clients  are  vital  to\nmaintain and acquire competitiveness. ICT can dramatically reduce the cost and\ntime of communication, and make the PDMCs part of the global market.\n(iv)  Increasing effectiveness of economic reforms. Economic reforms often fail in\nimplementation due to weak compliance. Good monitoring mechanisms can help.\nThrough ICT, policy reforms can be embedded into institutional processes and\ntransactions, which can then be readily monitored and audited.\n(v)  Monitoring  and  protecting  the  environment.  Environmental  monitoring,\nprimarily using geographic information systems, is inherently data intensive, and\nthus  more  effective  using  ICT.  These  systems  are  already  practical  and\nincreasingly inexpensive for use in remote areas.\n(vi)  Reducing  information  and  income  inequalities.  The  relationship  between\naccess to information and level of income is strong. The global market and ICT\nchanges threaten to increase inequity, but also provide tools to reduce poverty as\nlong as governments embrace a pro-poor agenda of ICT-improved access to\neducation, health care, and information.\n6. Several regional organizations are facilitating the spread of the global economy by\ndeveloping ICT projects in the Pacific. The United Nations Development Programme and the\nSouth Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission are providing assistance to countries that have\nbenefited less from ICT. They aim to create initial core ICT-based information systems, and train\nusers on how to take advantage and leverage such systems. The World Bank is managing the\nglobal grant Information for Development Program (InfoDev) to promote innovative ICT projects\nin several Pacific countries. The South Pacific community, meanwhile, is encouraging Pacific\ncountries to cooperate to narrow the gap in ICT infrastructure. The University of South Pacific\nand College of Micronesia are also running distance learning activities with their branches in the\nPDMCs. And the United Nations Development Programme's Pacific Information Technology\nPromoting Project is helping the Pacific island nations develop human resources; build web\nsites;  and  install  equipment  for  remote  education,  medical  services,  and  environmental\npreservation.\n7. Several  bilateral  assistance  agencies  are  assisting  ICT  development  in  the  Pacific.\nAmong them, the assistance provided by Australia and Japan in the South Pacific, and by the\nUnited States in the North Pacific, is notable. Finally, professional associations are promoting\nthe use of ICT to improve service delivery, e.g., the Pacific Basin Medical Association initiated\nthe Western Pacific Health Net. Political awareness is progressively increasing, and given the\nnumerous initiatives, the need for a formal institutional coordination mechanism is emerging.\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.  Objective\n8. The main objectives of the TA are to help the PDMC governments assess their ICT\nreadiness, prepare the framework for future development in the sector, and identify bankable\nprojects for such. Wider and increased use of ICT will contribute to a more effective and\nequitable economy and society.", "3\nB.  Scope\n9. The TA will provide assistance to the PDMCs in the following areas:\n(i)  Assess the ICT readiness in the Pacific. The TA will help the PDMCs self-assess\nthe gap between ICT demand and supply, and identify the most urgent actions\nneeded to fill the gap. The self-assessment will include (i) network availability and\naffordability;  (ii)  education,  human  resources,  and  computer  literacy;  (iii)  e-\ncommerce and e-government  practices; and (iv) political climate and regulatory\nframework.\n(ii)  Increase  awareness  of  the  importance  of  ICT,  its  potential  benefits  in  the\nPDMCs, and the resources required to bridge the digital divide. Background\npapers on ICT readiness in terms of physical infrastructure, financial and human\nresources,  and  political  climate  in  the  individual  PDMCs  will  be  prepared,\ndiscussed  in  the  ICT  readiness  workshop,  disseminated,  and  eventually\npublished.\n(iii)  Discuss the best practices and lessons learned in using ICT. The ICT-readiness\nworkshop will provide a forum for PDMC officials to share their knowledge and\nexperience.  Case  studies  on  what  has  and  has  not  been  achieved  will  be\npresented,  discussed,  and  disseminated.  The  workshop  will  also  assist  in\nidentifying and creating the PDMC champions for ICT development.\n(iv)  Make the stakeholders aware of the other players and define ADB's role to\nmaximize ICT benefits. With ADB\u2019s role in the Pacific and the possible partner in\nICT  development  defined,  the  TA  will  seek  the  active  and  coordinated\ninvolvement of all stakeholders\u2014governments, private sector, local communities,\nnongovernment organizations, and international organizations. The broader and\nmore effective the partnerships between ADB and these agents, the faster the\nadjustment will occur.\n(v)  Assist the PDMCs in preparing a practical and flexible ICT national policy and\nstrategic framework to eventually be adopted by individual countries. The policy\nand strategy framework will be based on sustainability, social inclusion, and\ncooperation among the PDMCs.\n(vi)  Identify assistance needed to increase ICT effectively and equitability. Possible\nADB assistance will include physical infrastructure; social inclusion; as well as\nservices such as distant learning, telemedicine, and e-government.\n10. The focus countries of the Project will be all 12 PDMCs: Cook Islands, Fiji Islands,\nKiribati, Republic of the Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, Papua New\nGuinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.\nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n11. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $300,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed by\nADB on a grant basis from the ADB-funded TA Program. Details of the TA costs are shown in\nAppendix 2.", "4\nD.  Implementation Arrangements\n12. ADB's Office of Pacific Operations (OPO) will be the Executing Agency. The TA will\nrequire approximately five person-months of a principal ICT international consultant over 12\nmonths. The consultant will be selected on an individual basis. The TA will also require two\nperson-months of short-term international consultancies, as well as two resource persons for\nthe workshop. In addition, domestic consultants from the Philippines will be engaged to work at\nADB headquarters for seven person-months as administrative and research assistants. They\nwill  assist  in  organizing  the  ICT  workshop  and  in  preparing  quarterly  progress  reports  for\nmanagement, and a final report upon TA completion.\n13. The consultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic\nconsultants. The team leader will be in charge of coordinating inputs and outputs of individual\nteam members. In the course of preparing the studies, consultants will visit the PDMCs as\nappropriate. The terms of reference for consulting services are detailed in Appendix 3.\n14. After an initial desk-Internet review, the principal consultant will prepare an inception\nreport within three weeks of the start of the services. The interim report, including information on\nthe progress of the study, will be submitted within three months of the commencement of\nconsulting services. The draft final report, containing the findings and recommendations of the\nstudy will be provided one month before the end of consulting services for comments by ADB\nand the PDMC governments. The recommendations of the draft final report will be discussed at\na workshop on ICT readiness in the Pacific, with the participation of the consultants and PDMC\ngovernment officials. An integrated final report, incorporating the comments of the governments\nand ADB, will be prepared within a month of receipt of comments and posted on the ADB-OPO\nwebsite. The TA will commence in September 2001 and be completed in August 2002.\n15. The ICT readiness workshop in the Pacific will be held at ADB headquarters in Manila\naround July 2002. The workshop is expected to run for three days with about 20 participants\nand 2 facilitators.\n16. ICT equipment and software required under the TA will be procured in Manila with\nassistance from ADB\u2019s Office of Information Systems and Technology, and in accordance with\nADB's Guidelines for Procurement. After TA completion, the equipment purchased will remain\nwith OPO. Acting on advice from the consultants, OPO will be responsible for organizing and\nmanaging the ICT readiness workshop funded by the TA.\nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n17. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the\nprovision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of\n$300,000,  for  Information  and  Communication  Technology  Assessment  in  the  Pacific,  and\nhereby reports such action to the Board.", "5\nAppendix 1, page 1\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK\nDesign Project Monitoring Assumptions\nSummary Targets Mechanisms and Risks\nGoals\nContribute to Increased use of Household surveys, Capacity for ICT use is\neconomic growth and information and poverty assessments, effectively and equitably\npoverty reduction. communication and efficiency gains increased.\ntechnology (ICT)\nObjective\nAssess ICT Increased awareness PDMC governments No bankable projects are\nreadiness in the of the importance requests for ADB identified.\nPacific developing and limits of ICT in assistance for bankable\nmember countries the PDMCs and projects\n(PDMCs) in identification of\nassessing their ICT bankable projects\nreadiness, and\nprepare the PDMCs to use the Number of references to\nframework for future identified framework the framework in the\ndevelopment in the for future ICT sector PDMCs' official\nsector. development documents\nOutputs\nAssess ICT Background papers Review of and feedback Low participation and\nreadiness in the to be presented in on the background feedback\nPDMCs. the ICT readiness papers disseminated\nworkshop\nIncrease Dissemination of the Feedback on the Low participation and\nawareness on the background papers background papers feedback\nimportance of ICT and presentation of disseminated\nand on the resources ICT readiness\nrequired. workshop\nDiscuss best Case studies Dissemination of the Low participation and\npractices and lessons produced and background papers and feedback\nlearned in using ICT. discussed in the attendance at the\nworkshop workshop\n(Reference in text: page 1, para. 1 )", "6\nAppendix 1, page 2\nIncrease awareness Strategic alliance More stakeholder Stakeholders' interest in\nof the other with one regional coordination coordination\nstakeholders and governmental\ndefine ADB's role in organization and one\nmaximizing ICT regional\nbenefits nongovernment\norganization (NGO)\nAssist PDMCs and Template for ICT ICT national policy and Low participation.\nET in preparing a national policy and strategy framework\nflexible ICT national strategy framework\npolicy and strategy\nframework\nIdentify assistance Draft terms of Review of the draft TOR Bankable projects are\nneeded to increase reference (TOR) for for further assistance identified.\nICT effectively and assistance\nequitability\nActivities\n3.1 Background Background papers Review of and feedback Low participation\npapers on ICT emphasizing physical on the background\nreadiness and human papers\nresources available\nand required in the\nPDMCs\n3.2 Workshop on ICT Workshop with 2 Minutes of the workshop Low participation and\nreadiness in the resource persons and feedback from the feedback\nPDMCs to be held in and around 20 resource persons and\nManila around March participants participants\n2002\n3.3 Flexible ICT Template for ICT Review of the proposed Low feedback\nnational policy and national policy and policy and strategy and\nstrategy framework strategic framework feedback from the\nnational authorities\n3.4 Draft TOR for Draft TOR on Review of the proposed Bankable projects are\nfurther assistance different TAs for ICT TOR and feedback from identified.\ninfrastructure and the national authorities\nservices, including\ndistance learning,\ntelemedicine, social\ninclusion, e-\ngovernment, and\neducation", "7\nAppendix 2\nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN\nTotal\nItem Cost\nAsian Development Bank Financinga\n1.
