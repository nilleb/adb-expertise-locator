INTRODUCTION \n1.  Dengue has emerged as major public health problem in Southeast Asia, with the region \naccounting for 52% of the global risk. The transmission of dengue is facilitated by uncontrolled \nurbanization, environmental degradation, the lack of a reliable water supply, and improper \nmanagement and disposal of solid waste. To strengthen the regional response and the capacity \nto combat dengue, the Western Pacific Regional Office (WPRO) and the South-East Asian \nRegional Office of the World Health Organization (WHO) prepared a regional dengue strategy \nfor Asia and the Pacific,1 in consultation with developing member countries and development \npartners, including the Asian Development Bank (ADB).  \n \n2.  Communicable  disease  prevention  and  control  is  (i)  identified  by  ADB\u2019s  long-term \nstrategic framework 2008\u20132020 (Strategy 2020)2 as a regional public good and (ii) included as \none of the pillars of the Regional Cooperation Strategy and Program for the Greater Mekong \nSubregion. Dengue is an increasing public health threat in Cambodia, Lao People's Democratic \nRepublic  (Lao  PDR),  and  Philippines.  The  expansion  of  trade  and  tourism  increases  the \npotential risk that vectors may be introduced from endemic to non-endemic countries. Control of \ndengue transmission focuses primarily on vector control through integrated vector management \n(IVM),3 which utilizes environmental management, biological control and residual spraying. To \nsupport the implementation of IVM, the ministries of health requested that ADB and WHO help \nidentify and pilot community-based approaches to IVM.4 The regional technical assistance (TA) \nwill identify and pilot strategies for larval source reduction and control in Cambodia, Lao PDR, \nand  Philippines,  and  will  additionally  support  regional  dialogue  that  contributes  to  broader \ninteraction regarding dengue control. The concept paper was approved on 6 September 2008. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Dengue is caused by four closely related dengue viruses that are transmitted principally \nby the Aedes aegypti mosquito. The major contributing factors supporting transmission of the \ndengue virus are increased global movement of people and cargo via airplanes and ships, the \npresence of four dengue serotypes with little cross immunity, insufficient piped water supplies, \npoor basic environmental sanitation, and inadequate community participation in vector source \nreduction activities. The increasing number of severe, potentially fatal cases of dengue and the \nabsence of an effective vaccine5 highlight the need to better understand dengue epidemiology \nand implement sustainable IVM-based interventions. \n \n4.  Historically, dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) have been reported \npredominantly  among  urban  and  peri-urban  populations,  where  the  density  of  dwellings \nincreases the likelihood of transmission, but this epidemiology is changing rapidly. Evidence \nfrom recent outbreaks (such as the outbreak in Cambodia in 2007, which resulted in almost \n40,000 hospitalizations and 400 fatalities), suggests that outbreaks are now spreading to rural \nareas. The timing of dengue and DHF outbreaks has become increasingly irregular, and they \n                                                 \n1  The strategy was endorsed by WHO ministers in September 2008. \n2  ADB 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank 2008\u20132020, \nManila. \n3  IVM  includes  (i)  advocacy,  social  mobilization  and  legislation;  (ii)  public  policies  that  promote  basic \nsanitation, hygiene, and a safe environment for the household and community; (iii) collaboration within the health \nsector, and between it and other sectors; (iv) an integrated approach; and (v) evidence-based decision making and \ncapacity building.  \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB's website on 22 September 2008. \n5  The development of a dengue vaccine is complicated by the need to incorporate four virus serotypes in a single \npreparation. \n ", "2   \nare no longer confined to the rainy season. The Aedes aegypti mosquito is highly domesticated, \nlives and breeds in and around houses, and feeds almost exclusively on humans. Consequently, \npeople who spend more time at home during the day, (e.g., mothers and children) are more \nlikely to be infected.  \n  \n5.  The mosquito breeds successfully in water that accumulates in discarded trash such as \nbottles, used tires, and plastic packaging, as well as in domestic water storage containers, \nwhich are used where people do not have easy access to a regular supply of piped water. A \nrange of interventions have been tested; chemical control using larvicides such as Abate, which \ntarget  insects  during  the  larval  life  stage,  is  the  main  strategy  used  during  the  dengue \ntransmission season. While effective, this intervention should be viewed as an interim measure \ndue to its high cost, dependency on external funding, low level of community mobilization, and \nthe prospect the mosquito may develop resistance to the insecticide. Cost-effective community-\nbased interventions have been tested in some countries and include the mechanical removal of \nbreeding sites, the provision of covers for water storage containers and the use of larvivorous \nfish. \n \n6.  It is estimated that about 80% of mosquito breeding grounds are in water jars and water \ntanks in urban and rural households in Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Philippines. Therefore, in an \nattempt to reduce the risk of dengue outbreaks, water jars and drums in these countries have \nbecome a target for dengue vector control activities. Jar covers of various types are used by \nhouseholds; many of them are neither efficient nor durable.   \n \n7.  Larvivorous fish such as guppy fish are being used as biological control agents in water \njars and other large containers. In Cambodia, the introduction of guppy fish resulted in a sharp \ndecline  in  the  entomological  indicators  (House,  Breteau,  and  Container  indices).6 Within  8 \nmonths of the introduction of guppy fish, 79% of water containers were free of mosquito larvae.7 \nIn the absence of mosquito larvae, fish can survive through the consumption of algae and \norganic substances present in water jars. \n \n8.  Unlike malaria prevention and control programs, which rely on substantial external funds \nthrough the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Malaria and Tuberculosis, there is limited external \nfinancial support for dengue control and prevention in member countries of the Association of \nSoutheast Asian Nations. National dengue program budgets are largely earmarked for outbreak \ncontrol\u2014with an emphasis on chemically based interventions and to a lesser extent on capacity \nbuilding at the community level\u2014and not towards vector control based on entomological and \nepidemiological data. The budget for dengue control is allocated largely to the procurement of \ninsecticides for chemical control. Essential preventive interventions\u2014including those targeting \ncommunity-based vector control through source reduction\u2014are thus left unfunded, particularly \nbetween outbreaks. Dengue interventions that focus on outbreak response concentrate almost \nexclusively on chemical control rather than on more sustainable vector control methods, which \nshould be in place during outbreaks. \n \n9.  Public education and community mobilization are essential to ensure vector control \nprograms are sustainable. While public awareness of dengue control is increasing in most \ncountries, actions are implemented only during dengue outbreaks. Innovative approaches that \n                                                 \n6  To Setha et al. 2007. A Community-Based Dengue Vector Control in Rural Villages of Cambodia.

Findings and lessons from the pilot will be essential in \nstrengthening national dengue prevention and control programs and encouraging future funding \nfor dengue.  \n \n10.  ADB supports Cambodia and the Lao PDR through the Greater Mekong Subregion \nCommunicable Disease Control Project, which aims to strengthen dengue outbreak control, \nsurveillance and clinical case management.8 A regional TA on surveillance, prevention, and \ncontrol of severe acute respiratory syndrome, avian influenza, and other emerging diseases \nassists the Philippines in clinical case management of dengue and training of community health \nworkers on dengue prevention and control.9 These programs for the prevention and control of \ncommunicable  disease  are  regional  public  goods.  Regional  cooperation  will  yield  greater \nbenefits than will independent country-level interventions. Dengue is transmitted via vectors and \nenvironments  that  bridge  country  borders.  Dengue\u2019s  transboundary  nature,  combined  with \nincreasing travel that has the potential to transfer the dengue virus from endemic to non-\nendemic countries, makes regional cooperation for dengue prevention and control essential.10 \nThe TA is intended to assist the three countries identify and pilot community-based vector \ncontrol interventions. In this context, the involvement of communities and the coordination of \nstakeholders in and outside the health sector will be essential to optimize the impact of the TA, \nin cooperation with WHO and other development partners.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The expected impact of the regional TA is a reduction in the number of dengue fever and \nDHF cases in the project areas. The outcome is reduced vector density of mosquito larvae in \nhousehold water containers.     \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will focus on active involvement in communities and primary schools and in \nsource reduction and biological control of domestic water sources. The TA will have two outputs: \n(i)  piloted  community-based  strategies  for  vector  source  reduction,  and  (ii)  strengthened \ncommunication for source reduction. \n \n1.  Output  1:  Piloted  Community-Based  Strategies  for  Vector  Source \nReduction \n13.  The aim is to (i) build capacity for source reduction (physical removal of breeding sites \nthrough,  for  example,  waste  management  in  domestic  environments);  and  (ii)  introduce \nbiological  control  in  household  water  containers  through  the  introduction  of  guppy  fish, \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2005.

Further, dengue was imported from Japan to the southern parts of the United States \nin the 1980s via tire shipments. Larvae eggs can survive for 3 months.  \n ", "4   \ncomplementing the physical removal of other breeding sites. Although guppies have been \nintroduced in the Philippines (for malaria prevention) and in Cambodia (for dengue control), it \nwould be necessary to determine whether containers (including water drums, tanks and jars) \nwould be appropriate fish habitats. Activities undertaken between dengue outbreak seasons will \nfocus on non-chemical interventions, such as covering household water jars with nylon net \nprototypes11 and other suitable covers, to reduce potential mosquito breeding sites and required \nclean-up activities.  \n \n14.  The TA will finance (i) the design, pre-testing, production, and distribution of water jar or \ndrum covers; and (ii) assess (a) procurement and operations costs, and (b) costs associated \nwith raising, distributing and monitoring the acceptance by the community of guppy fish. A \nbaseline entomological study of vector density will be conducted in the project areas during the \nfirst 3 months, with the design, pre-testing and production of the covers undertaken over the \nnext 6 months. Frequent entomological assessments will evaluate the efficacy of the covers and \ntheir use by households.    \n \n2.  Output 2: Strengthened Communication for Source Reduction \n15.  The  aim  is  to  reduce  vector  breeding  sites  by  modifying  behavior  through  health \neducation  and  community  mobilization.  Information  and  communication  strategies  will  be \nprepared for health and non-health staff, including teachers, school children, parents, women\u2019s \norganizations, religious groups and communities, to ensure the new water jar covers and guppy \nfish are utilized effectively. This will include training of teachers on the identification of breeding \nsites and on non-chemical source reduction measures, including the use of guppy fish and \nwater jar covers. Educational messages will be prepared encouraging behaviors that reduce \npotential  breeding  sites  in  and  around  houses  and  schools,  and  additional  information, \neducation, and communication materials on dengue prevention and control will be provided.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1.25 million equivalent. ADB will finance $1 \nmillion on a grant basis through ADB\u2019s Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund under the \nRegional Cooperation and Integration Financing Partnership Facility; this includes $150,000 that \nwill be provided to WHO for technical oversight of the pilot interventions in the three countries. \nWHO will provide $200,000 in-kind in the areas of integrated vector management and capacity \nbuilding. The balance of $50,000 equivalent will be provided in-kind by participating countries.12 \nThe cost and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  ADB\u2019s  Southeast  Asia  Department  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA.  A \nmemorandum  of  understanding  will  be  developed  between  ADB  and  WHO  outlining  a \ncooperation framework for TA implementation. Local WHO offices will collaborate and provide \ntechnical support in the pilot areas, while overall technical guidance will be provided through the \nWHO WPRO. Each participating country will designate a focal point for interactions between the \ncountry\u2019s ministry of health, other government agencies, and the consultants engaged under the \nTA. Counterpart personnel at the national and local levels will provide direction and technical \n                                                 \n11 In Savannaketh, up to 77% of water jars have been found to contain larvae. Weekly emptying and cleaning of large \nwater jars is not acceptable to communities because of the large size of the water jars. A pilot program to introduce \nnylon nets to cover water jars in four villages in Savannaketh and Champassak provinces was conducted in 2007.  \n12 The in-kind support will include remuneration and per diem of counterpart staff. \n ", "  5\ninputs. Provincial departments of health will be responsible for implementation of all community-\nbased activities, including monitoring and surveillance, in cooperation with community leaders \nand women\u2019s groups. The provincial departments of health will coordinate the village-level pilot \ninterventions.  For  example,  community  health  workers  will  be  responsible  for  raising  and \ndistributing the guppy fish and disseminating water jar covers. Social mobilization with regard to \nlarvae detection will be provided jointly by community health workers and women\u2019s groups, and \nfocused  at  households.  Departments  of  education  will  be  responsible  for  (i)  information \ndissemination for school children, teachers and members of the parent-teacher associations; (ii) \nteacher training; and (iii) monitoring of school-based activities.  \n \n18.  A consulting firm will be engaged by ADB. TA implementation in the three countries will \nrequire approximately 16 person-months of international consultant services for TA coordination \nand social mobilization, and 6 person-months of national consultant services for financing and \nhealth economics. The WHO WPRO will provide technical support for the duration of the TA \nfrom its own malaria and other vector born and parasitic diseases (MVP) unit staff and from \nMVP staff of the WHO country offices in the three participating countries for 6 person-months \neach,  on  a  part-time  basis.  The  consultants  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  national  consultants.  The \ndisbursements under the TA will be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook.13 The Project will begin in May 2009 and be implemented over 24 \nmonths, ending in April 2011. An inception report will be submitted within 6 weeks of TA \ncommencement, outlining detailed activities for each country and a time-bound implementation \nplan. Within 12 months, a regional consultation meeting will be held to share initial results of the \npilot interventions, and a midterm report will be presented. A final report will be completed within \n2 months of project completion. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis \nfor the Regional Public Goods for Health: Combating Dengue in ASEAN, and hereby reports \nthis action to the Board. \n                                                 \n13  ADB. 2008.
