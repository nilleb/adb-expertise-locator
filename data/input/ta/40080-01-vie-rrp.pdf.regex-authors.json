I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan;  and  (ii)  proposed  administration  of  a  loan  to  be  provided  by  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de \nD\u00e9veloppement (AFD), both to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Ha Noi Metro Rail \nSystem Project (Line 3: Nhon \u2013 Ha Noi Station Section).1 \n  \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n2.  Strategic context of urban transport. The Government of Viet Nam is well aware of \nthe impact of inadequate transport infrastructure on economic growth. Failure to invest in major \npublic transport infrastructure to support a major modal shift away from private transport in \nmajor  cities  will  constrain  economic  growth  and  accelerate  degradation  of  the  urban \nenvironment.  The  government  supports  transport  sector  investment  to  promote  economic \ngrowth and protect the environment through a low carbon growth path that reduces greenhouse \ngas  emissions.2 The  2007\u20132010  Viet  Nam  country  strategy  and  program  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB)3 supports the government's investment program to improve urban \ntransport infrastructure and reduce transportation costs. \n \n3.  Ha Noi is Viet Nam\u2019s capital and the second-largest city in Viet Nam; the population of \nthe greater urban area is about 6 million, and is expected to reach almost 8 million by 2025. \nPrivate vehicles dominate transportation, with about 90% of transport modal share. Inadequate \nroad infrastructure results in heavy congestion during peak hours, and this will worsen when \nmotorbike riders switch to cars as their household incomes improve. While the road network is \nexpanding slowly, the growth cannot meet the expected increase in demand, and most inner \ncity areas face space limitations on road capacity expansion. Private transport is not sustainable \nas the principal transportation mode. A well-integrated high capacity public urban transport \nsystem is essential to meet the demands of Ha Noi, and a metro rail system is the most \nappropriate solution for densely populated inner city areas. Without investment in major public \ntransport infrastructure to support a significant modal shift to public transport, economic growth \nwill be severely constrained and the urban environment will deteriorate due to high logistics \ncosts and severe congestion. Ha Noi is at an early stage of adoption of private motorization, so \ninvestment in major public transport infrastructure represents an effective means to reduce \nfuture urban congestion.4 \n \n4.  The proposed project5 will develop a new double track metro rail line in Ha Noi,6 which is \none of four priority lines of a planned larger urban transportation system under the Ha Noi Urban \nTransport Master Plan (HUTMP). Metro line 3 will (i) facilitate public transport connectivity, (ii) \ngreatly enhance access in five districts of Ha Noi, and (iii) be an important integral part of an \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   Viet Nam Socio-Economic Development Plan for 2011\u20132015   \n3  ADB. 2006. Country Strategy and Program: Viet Nam, 2007\u20132010. Manila. \n4  The same situation occurs in Ho Chi Minh City, and a metro system is being concurrently developed, for which \nADB has provided financing, approving a multi-tranche financing facility of $540 million on 14 December 2010.  \nADB. 2010. Multitranche Financing Facility to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Ho Chi Minh City Urban Mass \nRapid Transit Line 2 Investment Program. \n5  First posted on ADB website on 16 March 2006. \n6  ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Preparing the Ha Noi Metro Rail System \nProject. Manila (TA 4900-VIE). ", "2 \nimproved public transport system, which aims to achieve increased public modal share through \nlow-carbon transport that reduces greenhouse gas emissions. \n \n5.  Ha Noi public transport sector. The existing public transport system consists of a bus \nnetwork that is not well integrated between operators, is not competitive with private transport \nmodes, and has a current modal share of around 10%. Traffic planning and traffic management \nsystems are inadequate to effectively control city traffic demand and do not promote public \ntransport usage. Rapid growth in private ownership of cars and motorbikes has led to heavy \ncongestion along major routes and inner city areas that constrains accessibility, resulting in a \ndangerous urban environment for commuters. As traffic levels increase, high volume public \ntransport modes are required to both alleviate existing congestion and meet expected long-term \ntransportation demand. However, the necessary infrastructure improvements will be ineffective \nwithout complementary policy and regulatory measures to both promote public transport and \ndiscourage private transport modes for city residents and suburban commuters. \n \n6.  The HUTMP will (i) establish six metro lines as a network crisscrossing the central \nbusiness area and serving outer population centers, with the initial phases of metro lines 1, 2, \n2A, and 3 expected to be operating by 2020; and (ii) strengthen and expand the bus system and \nmake traffic management system improvements, to support a modal shift from private to public \ntransport. The key objective of the plan is to increase public transport\u2019s modal share to 45%\u2013\n50% of demand. The resulting reduction in the growth of private vehicle numbers will improve \nthe urban environment for city residents by reducing accidents, air and noise pollution; and \nincreasing the number of pedestrian-friendly urban areas. \n \n7.  Public  transport  financing  and  sustainability.  The  HUTMP  public  transport \nimprovements that are proposed up to 2020 are estimated to cost $5.8 billion, consisting of $5.2 \nbillion for four priority metro lines and $0.6 billion for other public transport improvements. The \ncentral government is providing financing for the infrastructure components, and the Ha Noi city \ngovernment financing the operational equipment and systems. Annual budgetary allocations \ncan meet less than 15% of the HUTMP financing requirements, so this shortfall will require \nfinancing from other sources, such as international financial institutions and the private sector. \nRecurrent expenditures for public transport services are funded primarily from allocations under \nthe Ha Noi city budget, but sources of revenue are not optimized. Bus fares are kept low to \ncompete  with  private  transport,7 resulting  in  subsidies  for  the  existing  bus  services.  Cost \nrecovery  is  further  reduced  by  the  inefficient  institutional  arrangements  for  establishing, \nallocating,  and  operating  bus  routes.  Improving  public  transport  sustainability  requires  the \nestablishment of high capacity metro lines to offer an efficient, affordable alternative to private \ntransport, and restriction of private vehicles through economic and other measures. \n \n8.  The project will complement ongoing developments in interconnected urban transport \nsystems and public transport management reform, including proposed bus rapid transit lines, to \nmeet user demand for better services. Other developments\u2014including proposed new feeder \nbus links to the metro system, enhanced integration and accessibility at stations, \"park and ride\" \nfacilities, pedestrian-friendly access, and the institution of policy changes\u2014will be implemented \nconcurrently  through  a proposed  loan  using  the  Clean  Technology  Fund  (CTF)8 and  ADB \nfinancing in 2012. \n                                                \n7  Private transport costs are kept artificially low due to pricing of private vehicles, parking, and vehicle operating \ncosts. \n8  The CTF is part of the multidonor global Climate Investment Fund, which supports low-carbon transport to promote \ngreenhouse gas emission reduction. Under the CTF, 2009 Clean Technology Fund Investment Plan for Vietnam, \nWashington, DC, approved 1 December, $50 million has been allocated from the CTF to support sustainable urban \n ", "3 \n \n9.  Lessons. For large transport infrastructure projects in Viet Nam, experience indicates9 \nstrong support is required to avoid implementation delays, ensure quality of works are achieved \nand build sustainable institutions. Poor local capacity affects timely implementation of land \nacquisition and resettlement, so adequate time and strengthening are important. These have \nbeen incorporated into the project design and through proposed technical assistance from \ncofinancing partners and proposed ADB financing in 2012. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact of the project will be the establishment of an integrated sustainable public \ntransport system in five districts of Ha Noi. The outcome will be competitive metro rail services \nalong the project corridor. \n \nC.  Outputs \n11.  The  project  outputs  will  be:  (i)  metro  line  3  is  operational;  and  (ii)  improved \nimplementation capacity of Ha Noi Metropolitan Rail Transport Project Board (HRB).  \n \n12.  The construction of metro line 3 will include: (i) all civil works for metro line 310, with a \ntotal length of 12.5 km (3.6 km is underground, 8.4 km is elevated, and 500 m in a transition \nramp) of a dual track rail metro line for phase 1 from Nhon to Ha Noi main railway station,11 and \nincluding the depot with ancillary buildings at Nhon, elevated viaducts, transition tunnel portal, \nbored tunnels, and 12 stations; and (ii) electrical and mechanical (E&M) systems, including all \nrailway  systems  (e.g.,  track  work,  rolling  stock,  traction  power,  signaling  and \ntelecommunications, E&M systems and facilities, ticketing system and ancillary services, and \nfacilities required to operate a modern metro line). \n \n13.  Improved implementation capacity to HRB will be provided to complete the detailed \ndesign,  procurement  assistance,  and  construction  supervision  for  all  civil  works  and  E&M \nsystems, to be funded by Direction G\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Tr\u00e9sor (DGT). Additional assistance to HRB will \nbe provided for verification of engineering designs and estimates, project management, and \ndesign  safety  audit,  to  be  funded  by  AFD.  Further  project  management  support,  capacity \ndevelopment, and studies for integrating the project with other public transport will be financed \nand implemented under a separate ADB loan (para. 18). \n \nD.

The  executing  agency,  Ha  Noi  People\u2019s  Committee  (HPC),  has  established  an \ninterdepartmental steering committee for the full metro system development in Ha Noi, chaired \nby the vice chairman of HPC,13 which is responsible for project oversight and coordination. The \nHRB was established in 2001 with the responsibility of overseeing the planning, design, and \nimplementation of metro line 2 and metro line 3 in Ha Noi. A Project Implementation Division 1 \nhas been established within HRB under one of its vice directors, which is responsible for day-to-\nday management and coordination of implementation of metro line 3, including compliance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time), Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time), and Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). \n \n18.  Capacity development in the form of consulting services and training will be provided to \nstrengthen the capability of the HRB and HPC public transport agencies. The proposed capacity \ndevelopment  will  be  separately  financed  and  implemented  by  ADB,14 and  will  provide  (i) \nadditional project implementation support, (ii) capacity building and training of HRB, and (iii) \nsustainable transport studies to improve metro integration with the public transport system and \ndetermine policy measures to support increased public transport usage. \n \n19.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n20.  The Ha Noi Urban Transport Master Plan identified metro line 3 as a priority line, and \nimplementation is being coordinated closely with three other metro lines being concurrently \ndeveloped, with quarterly financier coordination meetings held to ensure common issues are \nwell integrated. The project feasibility study was completed by DGT-funded consultants and \napproved in April 2009 and the detailed design is expected to be completed by June 2011. The \nproject is technically viable, with system technology choices based on efficient and proven \ndesigns, station layouts designed for future integration, depot facilities developed to maximize \nland usage and accommodate future extensions, and common technical standards adopted for \ninterlinked facilities between different metro lines. \n \n21.  Fully integrated facilities will allow seamless transfers at metro line 3 stations to other \nmetro  lines  or  public  transportation  modes,  and  to  private  transport.  Suitable  integrated \nsustainable urban transport measures will be implemented under the proposed loan in 2012, \nwhich will address (i) integrated accessibility at stations; (ii) coordination with overall public \ntransport, including bus routes; and (iii) necessary policy measures to support modal change. \nTo enhance metro system integration, the HPC is expected to establish by 2012 a public \ntransport authority with responsibility for planning, developing and regulating all public transport \nin Ha Noi. Operation and maintenance (O&M) of the metro system will be under a separate \nagency, with HPC creating a steering committee in October 2010 to establish the metro O&M \nentity by the end of 2012. Options for private sector metro operation will be considered once the \nridership has become stable to ensure investor risk is reduced and owner guarantees are not \nrequired. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n22.  The project will directly benefit public transport users and communities in five districts \nand indirectly benefit all transport users in Ha Noi. The main benefits are derived from improved \naccess to better, safer, cheaper, more reliable, and faster transportation, with additional benefits \nfrom road accident cost reduction, deferred capital costs of public transport and reduced road \nmaintenance  costs.  Greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  traffic  congestion  will  be  alleviated, \nproviding  social  benefits  that  include  improvements  to  air  quality,  access  to  government \nservices, and community quality of life. \n \n23.  Transport demand forecasts were prepared for the economic analysis. These cover the \ngreater Ha Noi region, with a combined population of 6.4 million in 2007. Daily demand for \nmetro line 3 is forecast to be 157,000 loadings at opening in 2016, increasing to 458,000 \nloadings in 2030.The project has an estimated economic rate of return (EIRR) of 12.7% and \neconomic net present value discounted at 12% is $67.1 million. While the EIRR is low, it is \ntypical of high-investment long-return projects; significant secondary benefits not included in the \nanalysis are logistics improvements, increases in property values and tax revenues, and the \nhigh non-transport congestion costs that would occur without the project. The sensitivity and \nswitching value analyses show that the EIRR is marginal, even with changes in user benefits \nand in project costs of 5%, so there is moderate risk that the entire project will not reach the \nEIRR  threshold  of  12%. While civil  works costs  are  at  high risk  of  increasing  above  5%, \nparticularly for the underground section where actual ground conditions could vary, there is also \n ", "7 \nthe potential for benefits: the development of the Ha Noi road network is unlikely to occur as \nplanned, and the resultant constrained capacity would increase private vehicle operating costs. \n \n24.  For the financial analysis, operating cost, but not capital cost,16 is covered by fare \nrevenue. The base case assumes that, by the start of operation, reorganized bus routes and \nother integration measures to optimize public transport will have been implemented. At the \nassumed fare of D3,300 per boarding, the forecast of strong patronage and annual fare revenue \nin the starting year (2016) yields a fare box ratio17 that equals or exceeds 1. The project is \nanticipated to require a total subsidy over the project life of $935 million and local subsidy of \n$597  million.  The  financial  rate  of  return  after  tax  is  1.8%,  which  exceeds  the  calculated \nweighted average cost of capital of 1.3%. If the urban public transport system optimization does \nnot materialize,  the  starting  year  daily  fare revenue  drops  by  40%, and  the  local  subsidy \nrequired is $830 million, up 35% from the base case, which constitutes a substantial increase in \nthe subsidy burden on the central government. \n \nC.  Governance \n25.  National and local governance performance in Viet Nam has improved recently. Public \nfinance  management  reform  has  brought  increased  disclosure  of  public  accounts,  higher \naccounting  standards,  and  progress  on  budgetary  rules.  The  November  2005  Law  on \nProcurement and regulations in 2006 and 2008 have established national bidding documents. \nDialogue continues with the government with a view to harmonizing national and international \nprocedures.  Measures  to  address  corruption  have  improved,  with  revisions  to  the  Anti-\nCorruption Law in August 2007 that established a national anticorruption steering committee. \nThe government is committed to reforming national institutions to reduce malfeasance waste \nand improve development effectiveness. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to \ndate) was explained to and discussed with the Ministry of Finance and HRB. Specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \n26.  The project will use international competitive bidding to improve oversight and mitigate \ncorruption,  which  improves  governance  if  implementation  delays  are  avoided  through \ninformation sharing. The bidding process will be further enhanced by improved transparency, \ninformation disclosure, oversight and monitoring, mitigation of fraud and collusion risks, handling \nof complaints, and sanctions and remedies. \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n27.  The  project  is  a  general  intervention  with  indirect  poverty  reduction  impacts.  Major \nbeneficiaries will be public and private transport users, with women, students in universities and \ncolleges along the metro, children, and older people expected to benefit the most from improved \ntransportation, as well as communities in districts along the project corridor. Local economies \nare expected to improve as a result of business opportunities created through improved and \ncheaper transport, and residents will further benefit through improved quality of life resulting \nfrom reduced congestion and pollution. Other beneficiaries include workers and traders traveling \nbetween the western part of Ha Noi and the central business district and service or commercial \nestablishments near the metro stations. Project districts will benefit from temporary construction \njobs and local employment in O&M. Women will be encouraged to work and will be treated \n                                                \n16 Under Railway Law 2005, the Ha Noi People\u2019s Committee will be responsible for financing rolling stock and E&M \nsystems, land and resettlement, and incremental administration, so the central government will relend any \nborrowing for these items. All other project works will be provided as grants. \n17 Fare revenue divided by O&M cost. \n ", "8 \nequitably. HRB will ensure that employment opportunities are announced to local communities \nand will also ensure that contractors conform to appropriate labor laws and standards, including \ntargets for women\u2019s employment. HRB will monitor the use of local labor and appropriate labor \nlaws  and  standards  within  the  first  3  months  of  the  commencement  of  each  construction \ncontract and take appropriate action to improve the employment and compliance if needed. \n \n28.  The potential adverse social impacts from the project are (i) increased risks of exposure \nto HIV/AIDS and human trafficking of women and children during construction and operation \ndue to the influx of construction workers, and (ii) increased commuter traffic. Safety risks for the \ncommunities  along  the  road  are  expected  to  increase  due  to  the  higher  concentration  of \npedestrians near stations. These risks will be addressed through the HIV/AIDS and human \ntrafficking awareness and prevention program and the public transport safety program, to be \nfunded separately. All civil works contracts under the project incorporate provisions and budgets \nrequiring that contractors  carry  out these  programs,  in  coordination  with  the  government's \nprograms and other initiatives under the proposed capacity building loan. \n \n29.  The project has been classified as effective gender mainstreaming; a gender action plan \nhas been developed that effectively mitigates negative impacts and includes positive design \nfeatures. The gender action plan will include but not be limited to: (i) use of employment targets \nfor  women  and  gender-specific  core  labor  standards  for  contracts  and  other  employment \ngeneration, (ii) consideration of gender-inclusive physical design features18 in infrastructure, and \n(iii) mitigation of the gender-related resettlement impacts. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n30.  Environment.  The  project  has  been  classified  as  environment  category  A  and  an \nenvironmental impact assessment (EIA) has been prepared to meet the requirements of ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement. An environmental management plan (EMP) covering the depot, \nviaduct and tunnel sections of the project has been prepared. The recommended environmental \nmitigation  measures  and  monitoring  activities  cover  the  preconstruction,  construction,  and \noperation stages of the project. Major issues addressed in the EMP pertain to spoils disposal \nand  impacts  on  air  quality  and  noise,  traffic,  culturally  significant  sites  and  undiscovered \narchaeological relics, groundwater quality, and the health and safety of workers and the public. \nThe  EMP  also  specifies  that  the  contractors  shall  develop  and  implement  environmental \nmanagement action plans in the form of specific management plans on dust and noise control, \ntraffic management, spoils disposal, spill management, occupational and community health and \nsafety, and emergency response. The EMP clearly defines the institutional arrangements and \nresponsibilities for its implementation and includes an environmental training program for HRB \nand  its  project  implementation  unit  to  develop  their  environmental  management  capacity. \nSeveral public consultations involving affected households and local officials in the project area \nwere  conducted  during  the  preparation  of  the  EIA. The  results  of  these  consultations  are \ndocumented in the EIA, while environmental concerns raised are addressed in the EMP. \n \n31.  A grievance redress mechanism based on existing legal provisions has been developed \nto facilitate resolution of complaints regarding the project\u2019s environmental, resettlement, and \nother  impacts.  To  ensure  that  the  required  mitigation  and  monitoring  measures  are \nimplemented, HRB shall include the EMP in the bidding documents for civil works. The results \nof semiannual EMP implementation monitoring shall be submitted by HRB to ADB. An external \n                                                \n18 Physical design features could include metro stations designed with universal access for women, disabled, elderly, \nand others; shopping and trading spaces; and women-only carriages. \n ", "9 \nenvironmental monitoring expert will verify the monitoring information submitted to ADB and \nassess if the EMP is being implemented as required. \n \n32.  Resettlement. Resettlement impacts are significant and the project is classified under \ncategory A. In the phase 1 Nhon depot area, there were 234 households (approximately 1,170 \npersons) affected by the acquisition of 14 hectares of productive land. Resettlement planning \nand compensation for Nhon Depot  phase 1 started in 2006, while compensation and site \nclearing took place from March 2007 to January 2008. Resettlement due diligence was carried \nout and a corrective action plan has been prepared. A resettlement plan for Nhon Depot phase \n2, the access line, and the main line has been prepared and includes provisions ensuring \nwomen\u2019s needs are given equal consideration as those of men. For the Nhon Depot phase 2, \nthe access line, and the main line, it is estimated that there are about 150 displaced persons; 90% \nare households and 10% private companies and government institutions. \n33.  Indigenous people. The project is classified under category C; no further action is \nrequired. \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n34.  The  project  will  have  several  implementation  risks  as  it  involves  complex  design \nstandards  with  multiple  interfaces  and  difficult  construction  techniques,  especially  in \nunderground  sections  where  archaeological  finds  or  unexploded  ordinance  may  be \nencountered. Key risks include that the metro line 3 is completed in isolation of other metro \nlines,  and  that  the  operation  of  other  lines  is  not  well  integrated;  this  may  impact  the \nsustainability of the transport system, as the viability is highly reliant on achieving estimated \npatronage. The risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nInadequate public transport policies result  The Ha Noi People\u2019s Committee will (i) expedite policy \nin  (i)  lack  of  integration  and  planning  of  analysis  and  approval  of  the  new  policies  and \nmetro lines, (ii) inadequate public transport  implementing regulations, and (ii) provide support to \nservices,  and  (iii)  increase  in  private  implement policy measures with CTF financing. \ntransport usage. \n \nPublic  transport  systems  not  integrated  The CTF-funded project in 2012 will implement key \nbecause  (i)  measures  are  implemented  measures. \nineffectively,  and  (ii)  the  fare  pricing  A  public  transport  authority  for  Ha  Noi  will  be \nstructure is not affordable.  established. \nDemand  forecasting  and  pricing  policy  will  be \ndetermined through proposed separate studies. \n \nWeak capacity of implementing agency to  International experts will support project management, \nhandle  cost  increase,  complexity  delays,  design auditing, and value analysis of detailed design. \nand other implementation issues \nLand acquisition delays  Full consultation and participation of potential affected \npeoples will ensure agreed and acceptable solutions \nare found. \nCTF = Clean Technology Fund. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n ", "10 \n35.  Procurement and safeguards due diligence constitute the greatest risk during project \nimplementation.  Safeguard  issues  pose  some  risk  as  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  is \nrequired for all underground stations and some elevated facilities. The HPC is responsible for \nensuring that bus transport is significantly developed prior to the operation of the metro lines \nand for policy changes to encourage the use of public over private transport. It is expected that \nbenefits and positive impacts will outweigh any mitigation costs. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n36.  The government and the HPC have assured ADB that implementation of the project will \nconform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. The government and the HPC have agreed with ADB on \ncertain  covenants  for  the  project,  which  are  set  forth  in  the  loan  agreement  and  project \nagreement. \n \n37.  The European Investment Bank, AFD, and DGT have agreed to comply with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement requirements for all components to be financed under the project. \nFor  the  one  jointly  cofinanced  contract  with  AFD,  ADB  procurement  and  disbursement \nguidelines will apply. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n38.
