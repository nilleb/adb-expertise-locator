Empirical  studies \nhave shown that gender inequality often links to uneven development outcomes, and that \naddressing gender-related issues can have a significant effect on the efficiency and welfare \naspects of policy interventions. The Ministry of Gender Equality and Family of the Republic of \nKorea has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide support for quantifying the \ncost of gender inequality in terms of foregone output growth, and to assist them in learning from \ngender policy initiatives in other countries in the region to further improve their own gender \npolicy and strategies. ADB has prepared the technical assistance (TA) in close consultation with \nthe Government of Korea and the ADB Gender Equity Community of Practice (including ADB \nmembers, gender specialists in regional departments, and resident missions). The proposed TA \nwill support analysis of (i) the macro-level aggregated impact of gender inequality on economic \ngrowth, examining issues such as female labor market participation, wage differences, and \neconomic growth; and (ii) micro-level (household) gender issues, such as access to education, \nlabor participation, and types of jobs, that tend to reflect the resource allocation and bargaining \npower of females within households.1 The TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Recent research suggests that economic growth can positively impact gender equity by \nreducing poverty and increasing opportunity. Gender inequality is often greater among the poor, \nboth within and across countries. For example, while the gender gap in primary and secondary \ngross enrollment rates decreased rapidly worldwide during 1991\u20132009, it remains greater in \npoor countries than in middle income and rich countries,2 with gaps between boys and girls \npersisting in poorer countries.3  \n \n3.  There is considerable evidence that gender gaps in education reduce economic growth,4 \nprimarily through the impact of female education on fertility, and on the creation of human \ncapital for the next generation. \n \n4.  Researchers using a Solow-growth framework have found that gender gaps in education \nsignificantly reduce the level of gross domestic product and income;5 such gaps also have a \nnegative impact on subsequent economic growth.6  \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 18 January 2014. \n2  E.

However, while the majority of the literature finds that gender inequality in education \nreduces economic growth, there are a few exceptions. For example, male secondary school \nattainment  has  been  found  to  be  positively  correlated  with  economic  growth,  while  the \ncorrelation between female secondary school attainment and economic growth is negative, \nalthough only marginally statistically significant. This surprising result may arise from the low \nlabor  participation  rate  of  highly  educated  women,  and  the  omission  of  other  important \nexplanatory variables.7 In contrast, a positive correlation has been found between the growth of \nper capita income and the initial level of female secondary school attainment, controlling for \nmale secondary school attainment.8  \n \n6.  Women\u2019s labor market participation grew in East Asia and Latin America during 1971\u2013\n1995. Although the growth rate exceeded that for men, with a consequent narrowing of the \ngender gap in wages, significant barriers to women\u2019s participation in labor markets remain.9 \nAnalysis of data for 18 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries \nfrom 1970 to 2005 found the gender wage gap for high-, medium-, and low-skilled workers is \nnegatively correlated with sector growth.10 In addition to the unequal access of females to \neducation, which adversely impacts their ability to build human and social capital, a key source \nof the gap between women and men in labor force participation stems from the expectations \nabout how women are to spend their time and what their activities should be.  \n \n7.  There is evidence that high female labor force participation contributes substantially to \neconomic growth. Using a growth accounting approach, research has found that the rise in \nfemale labor force participation in the four East Asian tiger economies11 accounted for 0.6%\u20131.6% \nof annual per capita growth in these economies, giving rise to a controversy on the relative role \nof productivity and factor inputs as explanations for economic growth.12 \n \n8.  The  impact  on  economic  growth  of  gender  inequality  in  employment  and  pay  has \nreceived  insufficient  attention;  the  few  existing  studies  of  the  effect  of  gender  gaps  in \nemployment on economic growth must be treated with caution as a result of problems of \nendogeneity, unobserved heterogeneity, and poor data availability and quality.13 The theoretical \nliterature on the subject also yields conflicting results.14 Some empirical literature suggests that \n                                                \n7 R.

There is extensive literature on gender inequality and economic development at both the \nmacro level (including cross-country analyses) and micro level (e.g., analyses using household \ndata). Nevertheless, research is needed that combines the extensive information available in \nmicro-level data (for example, national census data) with a macro-level model (e.g., a growth \nmodel) to help understand the contribution made by various factors associated with gender \ninequality to economic performance in country economies. An in-depth country analysis is \nneeded that focuses on the impacts of gender inequality on opportunity cost, resource allocation, \nand decision making on factors such as employment and education.  \n  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n10.  The  TA  will  support  micro-level  analysis  associated  with  gender  inequality  at  the \nhousehold level. Because gender issues have intrinsic, instrumental effects on development, \ngender-related research often encompasses other research areas, and could take the form of \nan extension of existing research. For example, research on access to education or increased \nskills training and/or retraining on development could be extended to examine gender. Where \ngender differences have strong intrinsic effects (e.g., education and human capital formation), \nhowever, it is necessary to conduct more intensive micro-level research that would provide a \nbetter  perspective  on  the  impact  of  intra-household  decision  making  on  the  allocation  of \nresources for education, sanitation, and health care, in order to provide a basis for improved \ntargeting of policy initiatives and projects. This research can be based on micro-level data and \nfocus on identifying country-specific policy priorities needed to improve gender equality.  \n \n11.  Gender-related research for purposes of development planning is generally implemented \nat two levels.  Microeconomic approaches focus on the behavior of the household and examine \nthe roles of household members, the decision processes within the household, the allocation of \nresources,  the  outcomes  at  the  micro  level,  and  their  implications  on  the  efficiency  and \neffectiveness of interventions. Macro-level approaches, on the other hand, examine the impact \nof  gender  at  an  aggregated  level,  often  examining  development  impacts  within  a  broader \ncontext, and in relation to other factors that contribute to economic development. Secondary \ndata available in the selected country will be used for the analysis. \n \n12.  A number of gender issues may be relevant across all countries irrespective of region or \neconomic development stage, while some gender issues may be relevant only for a specific \ngroup of countries. Women in developing regions tend to have less job security than those in \ndeveloped regions. In addition, gender issues faced by women in East Asia may not be similar \nto those faced by women in South Asia. Hence, the TA will look for similarities and differences \nin gender issues and economic development for selected countries. The country-specific issues \nrelevant to those selected countries will be drawn from existing country gender assessments, \nand further examined during the TA. \n \n                                                \n15 S.

The TA impact will be improved economic analysis of gender inequality issues and \nrelated opportunity cost in the selected DMCs (the People\u2019s Republic of China, India, Indonesia, \nthe Republic of Korea, and Pakistan), for gender policies and strategies. The outcome will be \neconomic  analysis  methodologies  for  the  study  of  gender  inequality  issues  and  related \nopportunity costs enhanced in selected DMCs. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The TA outputs are as follows:  \n \n(i)  Output 1: Gender inequality measured and analyzed. The TA will support \nanalysis  on  gender  inequality,  including  opportunity  or  forgone  costs  due  to \ngender  inequality  using  macro-  and  micro-approaches  and  discuss  priority \ncountry gender issues. Background papers will be prepared for each country. A \nshort policy note including recommendations will be prepared. \n(ii)  Output 2: Analysis of opportunity or forgone costs of gender inequality and \npriority  gender  issues.  Based  on  the  research  results  under  output  1,  a \nconsolidated synthesis report will be prepared. Three key focuses of the report \nare  (a)  quantifying  the  economic  costs  of  gender  inequality;  (b)  examining \nsimilarities and differences in priorities in gender equality countries and across \nregions; and (c) examining issues in the implementation of public policy to reduce \ngender inequalities.  \n(iii)  Output  3:  Sharing  knowledge  on  economic  analysis  for  gender \ndevelopment. Inception and midterm TA consultation workshops will support the \npreparation of outputs 1 and 2. National workshops and a regional conference \nwill be held to disseminate final research results from outputs 1 and 2 to a wider \naudience.  Representative  public  policy  makers  from  selected  countries  and \nscholars from within and outside the region will participate in the conference. A \nbook will be published based on the analysis under outputs 1 and 2 and will be \ndisseminated at a book launch. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nRepublic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund and administrated by ADB. ADB will \nnot finance any activity in the selected five DMCs unless a no objection is received from the \ngovernment of that DMC. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  ADB, through its Economics and Research Department, will be the executing agency of \nthe TA, responsible for all consultant recruitment and procurement, including administration of \nthe workshops. Throughout the TA period, the department will work closely with ADB\u2019s Gender \nEquity Community of Practice, gender specialists in regional departments and the Poverty \nReduction,  Gender,  and  Social  Development  division  of  the  Regional  and  Sustainable \nDevelopment Department, centers of excellence such as the Harvard Kennedy School and Korea \nUniversity, and relevant ministries of the selected countries.  \n \n ", "  5\n17.  Four  developing  member countries (DMCs)\u2014the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China, India, \nIndonesia, and Pakistan\u2014and a graduated DMC, the Republic of Korea, were selected for the \ncountry  analysis  based  on  their  size,  stage  of  economic  development,  and  availability  of \nrelevant data. Country background papers on gender inequality will discuss the cost of gender \nequality,  priority  areas  in  gender  inequality,  and  design  and  implementation  challenges  in \nidentifying effective gender policies.  The analysis will be prepared in consultation with the \nrespective governments in the selected countries. The TA will be implemented from 1 February \n2014 to 31 December 2015 (all activities will be completed by 30 September 2015).16 \n \n18.  The  proceeds  of  the  TA  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). The TA will support \na  total  of  34  person-months  of  consulting  services  (14  person-months  for  international \nconsultants, and 20 person-months for national consultants). The following specialists will be \nrecruited to conduct the analyses and produce TA outputs: an international lead economist, an \ninternational economic methodology expert, international labor and/or gender economists, an \neditor, and at least five national experts and/or international research assistants to support the \ninternational consultants. Any equipment purchased under this TA will be accounted for in an \nequipment turnover and/or disposal certificate prepared at the end of TA implementation. \n \n19.   International and national consultants will be engaged by ADB using individual selection \nmethods in accordance with ADB Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended \nfrom time to time). Procurement of survey equipment will follow ADB Procurement Guidelines \n(2013, as amended from time to time). Consultant inputs will be prepared on an intermittent \nbasis, with regular progress reports made to ADB and the selected government counterparts \nduring implementation.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund for Economic \nAnalysis for Gender and Development, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                \n16 DMC endorsements will be obtained before TA activities begin. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n \nPerformance Targets  Data Sources and \nDesign    and Indicators with  Reporting \nSummary  Baselines  Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact  By 2019     Assumption \nImproved economic  Economic analysis of    Selected governments \nanalysis of gender  gender inequality has  Government medium- provide priorities to improve \ninequality issues and  provided clear policy  term planning, policy,  gender equity. \nrelated opportunity  recommendations for  and strategy   \ncost in selected DMCs  the direction of gender  documents  Risk \nfor gender policies  policies and strategies  Governments are not open \nand strategies  (baseline: limited)  to discussing gender \noutcomes and implementing \npolicies that promote gender \nequality. \n \nOutcome  By September 2015    Assumption \n      Governments and ADB have \nEconomic analysis  An econometric model  Publication of an  the capacity to establish a \nmethodologies for the  to estimate the cost of  economic analysis for  methodology for the \nstudy of gender  foregone output due to  gender development, a  economic analysis. \ninequality issues and  a lack of labor force  synthesis report on   \nrelated opportunity  participation by  comparative analysis   Risk \ncosts enhanced in  females established  on gender inequality  Governments are not open \nselected DMCs   and economic growth,  to studies analyzing gender \ncountry analysis  issues that connect to a \nbackground papers  macro-level economic \nanalysis. \n \nOutputs      Assumptions \n      Governments support \n1.

The  report  will  consist  of  three  parts,  followed  by  conclusions  and  policy \nrecommendations. \n \n2.  Part 1 will attempt to quantify the economic costs of gender inequality or gender gaps in \nselected Asian countries. These costs are reflected in the loss of potential output resulting from \nlow labor force participation by women, as well as through other specific channels. Typical \neconometric studies that estimate potential output loss resulting from gender inequality have \nbeen based on gender differences in labor force participation. This study needs to go beyond \nthis traditional approach, and may consider the following:   \n(i)  A low level of education among women tends to have an inter-generational \nimpact. A lack of investment in the education of females has been found to lead \nto adverse educational, nutritional, and health outcomes for the next generation, \nwhich then affects the quality of the future labor force.  \n(ii)  The shortage of female role models in high-level political, corporate and other \nprivate sector positions may have implications for efficiency and for efforts to \nimprove  governance,  enhance  transparency,  curb  corruption,  and  strengthen \ninstitutions. These, in turn, affect the ability of a country to efficiently produce its \npotential economic output, or effectively use that output to benefit its populace.  \n(iii)  High female labor force participation in an economy tends to be in the informal \nsector and in low productivity jobs, where wages are low, including primarily \nthose in the agricultural sector, or in low-productivity service sector jobs. Many \nwomen may not have the choice to work outside the home, where they could find \nbetter  paying,  more  productive  work.  There  are  both  opportunity  costs  and \nforegone output when females hold low-productivity jobs. Low incomes from low \nwages tend to depress consumption and investment as well, reducing output to a \nlevel below its potential. \n(iv)  Violence against females tends to reflect both a lack of respect for their persons \nand a lack of female empowerment in the household and in society, and tends to \ncircumscribe the ability of women to fully participate in the economic and political \nlife of a society. The lack of physical, financial, and emotional security keeps \nwomen  bound  to  their  husbands  and  homes,  instead  of  affording  them  the \nfreedom to be independent and develop and use their talents outside of the \nhome.  \n(v)  We expect to add (and quantify the impact of) other channels. By comparing the \npotential  output  loss  resulting from these  different  channels,  we  can identify \npolicy priorities in gender issues across subregions in Asia, which is the topic of \nthe second part of this research.   \n \n3.  Part 2 will examine similarities and differences in gender inequality priorities within high-, \nmiddle-, and low-income countries, and regionally, with the goal of identifying priority gender \nissues, both regionally and in selected countries. Initially, assessment of how specific regions, \nsubregions and countries rank relative to a global gender gap standard will be made based on \ntheir income status (high-, middle, or low-income).  \n \n4.  Facts and priority areas in gender issues differ across regions, subregions, and within \ncountries. \n \n ", "  Appendix 4  13 \n5.  Income  levels  in  East  Asian  countries  are  similar  to  those  in  the  Organisation  for \nEconomic Co-operation and Development countries, but the existence and level of gender gaps \nbetween these groups of countries may be quite different. This may lead to the conclusion that \nhigh levels of income and growth, which have been characteristic of East Asian countries, do \nnot guarantee favorable gender outcomes, and raise the question why gender outcomes differ \nbetween regions or groups of countries that have similar incomes and levels of development. \n \n6.  Association of Southeast Asian Nations countries may be more heterogeneous in terms \nof household income and gender outcomes. Females from wealthy households in Association of \nSouth  East  Asian  Nations  countries  tend  to  have  better  access  to  education  and  health \nservices, and better nutrition compared to females from poorer households. Hence, gender \noutcomes may be dichotomized along income levels. It is important to determine why gender \noutcomes may differ within a country. Will increases in income levels necessarily lead to better \ngender outcomes within the same country? \n \n7.  Political participation seems less problematic, but there is a great inequality between \nwomen with high and low incomes. \n \n8.  In South Asia, Central West Asia, and the Pacific island countries, female access to \neducation and violence against women are particularly relevant gender issues. This is true even \nin some Central West Asian countries with high per capita income levels, in which females have \nhigh educational attainment. A large proportion of women do not work outside the home in \nformal employment; thus the underlying causes and channels of gender inequality are complex, \nand not characterized by a simple linear relationship between women\u2019s income or educational \nattainment and gender equality.  \n \n9.  The next step is to examine priority areas or issues in each selected country, and to \ndevelop policy recommendations.  \n \n10.  Part  3  will  examine  implementation  issues  in  using  public  policy  to  reduce  gender \ninequities. This  would  consist  of  a  detailed  analysis  of  (i)  the  politics  of  inequality  across \ncountries  being  studied  (from  state  level  through  regional,  ethnic,  community,  and  family \nstructure), and of the various state and non-state actors who may have interests in furthering \nequality, or retaining the status quo; and (ii) the existing theoretical and empirical evidence \naround policies that seek to improve equality in these and similar countries. This will allow for a \ndetailed, and wide-ranging analysis of policy options.   \n \n11.  The conclusions section will summarize the main findings in parts 1\u20133 and draw policy \nrecommendations on how to reduce the economic costs of gender inequality based on a better \nunderstanding of the causes. \n \n \n "], "metadata": {"Author": "ADB", "CreationDate": "D:20140219154841+08'00'", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2.2", "ModDate": "D:20140224080819+08'00'", "Producer": "GPL Ghostscript 9.07", "Subject": "Technical Assistance Report", "Title": "Economic Analysis for Gender and Development"}, "author_page": " \n \nABBREVIATIONS \n \n  ADB  \u2013  Asian Development Bank \n  DMC  \u2013  developing member country \n  TA  \u2013  technical assistance \n \n   \n \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CLASSIFICATION \nType  \u2013  Regional\u2014Research and development technical assistance (R\u2013\nRDTA) \nTargeting classification  \u2013  General intervention \nSector (subsector)  \u2013  Public sector management (economic and public affairs \nmanagement) \nThemes (subthemes)  \u2013  Economic growth (knowledge, science, and technological \ncapacities), gender equity (gender equity in [economic] \nopportunities), social development (human development)  \nLocation (impact)  \u2013  Rural (low), urban (low), national (high), regional (high) \nPartnerships  \u2013  Korea University; Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge \nPartnership Fund  \n \nNOTE \nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars.  \nVice-President  B.
