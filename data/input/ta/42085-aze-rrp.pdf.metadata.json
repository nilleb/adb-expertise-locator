It  will  construct  a  double-circuit  220 kilovolt  (kV) \ntransmission  line  from  Mingechevir  hydropower  plant  to  Absheron \nsubstation, to replace the existing two single-circuit 220 kV transmission \nlines (Mingechevir 1 and 2), which have been used for about 60 years. \nThe Project will increase the capacity of the power transmission network in \nthe west-to-east direction. This is crucial for ensuring the required stability \nof power supply to consumers in the key Azeri industrial and economic \nhub closest to the capital city of Baku. \n \nThe  project  components  comprise  (i)  construction  of  a  double-circuit \n220 kV  transmission  line  of  280  kilometers  (km);  (ii)  construction  of \nAgdash substation with installation of two 125 megavolt-ampere (MVA) \ntransformers  and  associated  110  kV  transmission  lines  near  Agdash \nsubstations;  (iii)  expansion  of  Absheron  substation;  (iv)  project \nmanagement support; and (v) institutional strengthening. \n \nRationale  Energy is a vital input to support growth in Azerbaijan\u2019s non-oil services \nand industry sectors. The power sector, along with the oil sector, plays a \nleading role in Azerbaijan\u2019s social and economic growth, contributing one \nthird of the country\u2019s gross domestic product in 2007. Development of the \npower  sector  has  been  one  of  the  Government\u2019s  priorities.  While  the \ncountry has been successful in engaging the private sector for developing \nand exporting its oil and gas resources, the domestic energy sector is \nthreatened by unreliable and inadequate power supply caused by limited \nmaintenance  of  aging  infrastructure  and  underinvestment.  Effective \ngeneration  capacity  has  shrunk  because  of  insufficient  funds  for \nrehabilitation and capacity addition. Low power plant efficiency and high \nlosses of transmission and distribution lead to wastage of fossil fuels that \ncould  have  been  exported,  and  nearly  double  the  emissions  of \ngreenhouse gas and other pollutants that damage the regional and global \nenvironment. \n \nToday, about 48.4% of Azerbaijan\u2019s 8.5 million people live in rural areas, \noften with insufficient access to quality basic services. Lack of sufficient ", "ii   \npower,  gas,  and  heat  has  aggravated  the  regional  imbalance  in  the \ncountry. Poor quality and unreliable electricity supply (i) inhibit industrial \nand commercial activities, constraining economic growth and employment \nopportunities in regional areas; (ii) promote switching to more polluting \nfuels and accompanying environmental impacts; and (iii) cause hardship \nto the population and affect their health.   \n \nThe  power  network  of  Azerbaijan  faces  two  major  development \nchallenges:  (i)  deteriorating  and  aging  generation,  transmission,  and \ndistribution  facilities;  and  (ii)  inadequate  levels  of  investment  and \nmaintenance. Over 20% of all energy equipment and over half of the \nnetwork  facilities  are  well  beyond  their  useful  life.  This  reduces  the \nreliability and efficiency of the power network operation. The high level of \nphysical  wear  of  equipment  at  power  plants  and  networks  leads  to \nfrequent power failures in the populated areas and affects the economic \nactivities in the country. The inadequate capacity of transmission lines also \nresults in a shortage of reserves in the stability of the power system, \nincreasing the potential risk of power system operation. Rehabilitation and \nupgrading of transmission facilities would significantly reduce the risk of \nfuture system failure. \n \nThe Project targets key strategic transmission lines, which are severely \ndeteriorated and need to be rehabilitated on a priority basis. The Project \nwill also contribute to optimizing the domestic energy resource utilization \nand  reducing  fossil  fuel  consumption  and  power  import.  The  current \nAzerbaijan  power  system  is  not  being  operated  optimally  because  of \nconstraints  on  existing  components  of  the  transmission  network. \nHydropower  energy  generated  in  the  west  region  is  not  efficiently \ndelivered  to  the  central  region  where  demand  is  increasing  rapidly. \nReplacement of the 220 kV transmission lines would allow the existing \nhydropower plant to increase its available outputs to the optimal level\u2014 \nthe peak power supply could be enhanced while power energy generated \nfrom  thermal  power  plants  in  the  central  and  east  regions  could  be \nreduced. This would permit optimal utilization of the grid networks and \ngeneration  capacity  by  reducing  the  shifting  operation  time  of  large \nthermal  power  plants,  thus  improving  the  efficiency  and  stability  of \ngeneration units and reducing excessive consumption of fuels. The saved \nfuel  including  gas  and  oil  would  be  exported  to  increase  government \nrevenues.  Thus,  Azerenergy  Open  Joint-Stock  Company  (Azerenergy) \nand the country would benefit from savings in fuel expenditures, improving \nenergy efficiency, and reducing environmental pollution. \n   \nImpact and  The  Project  aims  to  facilitate  the  country\u2019s  economic  development  by \nOutcome  strengthening  infrastructure  development,  removing  the  bottleneck  of \npower transmission, and improving the efficiency of services. The project \nimpact is an improved power transmission system that provides reliable \nand adequate electricity for sustained economic growth. \n \nThe outcome will be an expanded and strengthened backbone 220 kV \npower transmission and distribution network, with transmission bottlenecks \nremoved and losses reduced. \n \n ", "  iii\n   \nProject  The total investment cost of the Project is estimated at $240 million.  \nInvestment Plan \n   \nFinancing Plan       \nSource  Amount  %  \nAsian Development Bank     \n     Ordinary Capital Resources  160.0  67 \nAzerenergy   80.0  33 \nTotal  240.0  100 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n   \n  A loan of $160.0 million from the ordinary capital resources of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) will be provided under ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility. The loan will have a 25-year \nterm including a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment \ncharge of 0.15% per annum, and such other terms and conditions set forth \nin the draft loan and guarantee agreements. \n   \n  Azerenergy, which is the state-owned enterprise responsible for power \nproduction,  transmission,  and  distribution  in  Azerbaijan,  will  be  the \nBorrower while the Government will provide the sovereign guarantee.

Azerenergy will be assisted by a team of \ninternational  and  national  consultants  in  the  preparation  of  bidding \ndocuments, bid evaluation, and project supervision. Relevant international \npractices and standards will be adhered to in the implementation of the \nProject. Detailed construction and installation drawings will be available \nunder the Project and will be in line with specifications in the design, \nsupply, and installation (turnkey) contracts.  \n   \nProcurement  Procurement of goods and services financed from the proposed ADB loan \nwill  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines \n(2007, as amended from time to time). The major procurement will be \ndesign, supply, and installation contracts for the transmission lines and \nsubstation  facilities.  The  procurement  plan  will  be  updated  at  least \nannually covering the next 18 months of procurement activity. \n   \nConsulting  The project implementation consulting services include (i) procurement \nServices  and bidding for the tendering of design, supply, and installation contracts; \n(ii)  supervision  of  installation  and  construction,  final  testing  and \ncommissioning,  and  quality  assurance;  and  (iii)  project  performance \n   ", "iv   \nmonitoring  and  evaluation.  Azerenergy  will  finance  the  project \nimplementation consultants entirely from its own resources, and engage \nthe consultants in accordance with its procedures acceptable to ADB. \n \n   \nProject Benefits  The  direct  benefits  of  the  Project  are  improved  system  performance, \nand Beneficiaries  reduced  transmission  system  losses,  reduced  maintenance  costs, \ndeferred expenditure on new generation, reduction in imported power, and \nsalvage value from removal of the existing line. Such benefits have been \nestimated using extremely conservative figures. The economic base case \nshows the Project\u2019s economic internal rate of return of 14.8%. \n \nLong-term economic benefits are generated from the least-cost production \nof power, compared with developing an alternative energy source. Social \nimpacts include increased industrial production, opportunity for expansion \nof small and medium-sized enterprises, higher living standards through \nbetter  infrastructure  for  schools,  clinics,  local  services  for  lighting  and \ncommunication, and new job opportunities for local residents. \n \nRisks and  The Project is fully supported by the Government. The project components \nAssumptions  are straightforward, with minimal environmental and social impacts. The \nProject  was  designed  based  on  the  following  key  assumptions:  (i) \nmacroeconomic  growth  remains  stable,  (ii)  the  Government  remains \ncommitted to power sector reforms and development, (iii) the Government \nis  committed  to  establishing  cost-recovery  tariffs,  (iv)  Azerenergy  is \ncommitted to implementing social and environmental mitigation measures \nin  a  timely  manner,  (v)  the  project  and  financial  management  of \nAzerenergy is sound, and (vi) counterpart financing is adequate. \n \nRisks to the Project include (i) an unexpected increase in the prices of \ncommodities  and  raw  materials,  (ii)  a  delay  in  procurement  and \nrecruitment  of  consultants  caused  by  government  approvals,  and \n(iii) delays  in  implementation  of  social  and  environmental  mitigation \nmeasures. The Government and Azerenergy have taken the necessary \nmeasures to minimize these risks. The cabinet of ministers will coordinate \nthe work of the relevant government agencies to ensure that issues are \nresolved promptly. Adequate consulting services are provided to assist \nAzerenergy to manage implementation, monitor performance, and report \nto ADB. Price contingency funds are included to respond to unforeseen \ncost changes. Azerenergy also committed to implement the social and \nenvironmental mitigation measures fully, and relevant provisions will be \nincorporated in the civil works contracts. \n \nThe  project  financial  risk  is  low.  There  is  clear  evidence  that  the \nGovernment  has  had  considerable  success  in  transition  to  full  cost \nrecovery for the power utility by 2010. It also confirmed that no subsidies \nwill  be  given  to  Azerenergy  from  2008.  Tariff  reform  has  significantly \nsupported  the  target  of  achieving  a  financially  self-sustainable  power \nsector. The proposed Project, together with efforts from other development \npartners,  will  have  a  synergized  effect  on  enhancing  the  financial \nperformance of Azerenergy and will assist the Government in achieving its \nreform agenda. \n \n ", "o o\n46  00\u2019E 50  00\u2019E\nREPUBLIC OF AZERBAIJAN\nR U S S I A N\nG E O R G I A BalakenZagatala F E D E R A T I O N mur River Khudat EPNOHWANECRE TMREANNTS MPRISOSJIOECNT\nSa\nGusar Khachmaz\nGakh\nGuba\nSheki\nDevechi C A S P I A N     S E A\nAgstafa\nGazakh Shamkir Siazan\no Reservoir Oghuz o\n41  00\u2019N GoTvloavuSzhamkir Mingechevir ReservoirMingechevir Gabala Khyzy 41  00\u2019N\nGanja Ismailly\nSumgayit\nGeranboy Yevlakh\nKhanlar\nGadabey Agdash Ujar Agshu Maraza PPiirraalllalahhl Ilsland\nDashkesan Absheron Khyrdalan\nTerter Barda Kur River Kyurdamir SangaBchAaKlU Chilov Island\nAgdere Zardab\nA R M E N I A\nHajiqabul\nKelbajar Agjabedi Sabirabad Alyat\nSarisu Lake\nAgdam Ali-Bayramli\nKhojaly Imishli Saatly\nKhankendi Beilagan Ku\nShusha Khojavend r R\nHeidarabad Lachin iver\nSharur Fuzuli National Capital\nAraz River Araz River BilasuvarSalyan CThitey/rTmoawl nPower Station\nShahbuz Gubadly Neftchala Hydropower Station\nQivraq Jebrail\nNAKHCHIVAN Substation\nAraz Reservoir AUTONOMOUS Jalilabad Project Transmission Line\nNakhchBiavbaenk REPUBLIC Zangilan Masally 500 kV Transmission Line\n39o  00\u2019N Julfa 300 kV Transmission Line 39o  00\u2019N\nOrdubad 220--230 kV Transmission Line\nYardymly River\nAraz River N International Boundary\nLenkaran\nLerik Boundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n0 25 50 75\nI R A N\n08-0 Kilometers Astara\n7\n65 H 46o  00\u2019E 50o  00\u2019E\nR", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  Azerenergy  Open  Joint-Stock  Company  (Azerenergy),  guaranteed  by  the  Republic  of \nAzerbaijan  for  the  Power  Transmission  Enhancement  Project.  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.   Azerbaijan is rich in diverse and abundant energy resources. The overall volume of the \ncountry\u2019s hydrocarbon reserves is estimated 4 billion tons of oil equivalent, while the natural gas \nreserves are 1.8 trillion cubic meters. Oil production dominates in the country\u2019s economy, with \n50 million tons of oil produced annually.  \n \n3.  In 2007, gross domestic product increased by 25%, supported by a surge in crude oil \nproduction (31.5% increase) and exports (39.1% rise). This was due to increased production in \nthe Azeri\u2013Chirag\u2013Guneshli oil field, whose offshore oil is exported to western markets through \nthe Baku\u2013Tbilisi\u2013Ceyhan pipeline. Natural gas production was increased by over 70% owing to \nthe Shah Deniz offshore bloc, which started in 2007. Overall, the economy was boosted by \nlarge-scale public investment in infrastructure. Public investment focused on social sectors \n(health, education) and improvement of public utilities (electricity, heating, water supply, and \nsanitation).   \n \n4.   The power sector, along with the oil sector, plays a leading role in Azerbaijan\u2019s social \nand economic growth. The energy sector plays a central role in the economy, contributing to \none third of the country\u2019s gross domestic product in 2007, making it the economy\u2019s largest \nsegment. Development of the power sector has been one of the Government\u2019s priorities.  \n \n5.  Azerenergy is the state-owned enterprise responsible for operation and management of \nthe high-voltage transmission network and major thermal and hydropower generation plants. \nAzerenergy  owns  major  generation  and  all transmission  assets,  with  the  exception  of  two \nhydropower  plants  run  by  the  private  sector.  Of  the  total  installed  generation  capacity  in \nAzerbaijan, which reached 5,508 megawatts (MW) by March 2008, Azerenergy owns 98.5% \nincluding six thermal power plants (3,956 MW), four hydropower plants (1,018 MW), and five \nmodular power plants (452 MW). The power transmission and distribution grid consists of \nsubstations and transmission lines from 400 volts (V) to 500 kilovolts (kV), with a total length of \n110,000 kilometers (km). It has an extensive power transmission system connected to those of \nits neighbors, which allows import of power from the Iran, Russian Federation, and Turkey. \n \n6.  The electricity production of Azerbaijan in 2007 was 21,416 gigawatt-hours (GWh), of \nwhich 19,053 GWh (89% of total) was generated from thermal power and 2,363 GWh (11% of \ntotal) from hydropower. In 2007, about 360 GWh of electricity energy was imported from abroad. \nThe imported energy was primarily from Iran to supply Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, \nwhich does not have direct access to the national power network, and also from the Russian \nFederation with which Azerbaijan maintains an annual balance of import and export. The total \nexport electricity energy to Iran and the Russian Federation was 727 GWh. The total domestic \nelectricity  consumption  in  2007  was  19,000  GWh.  The  average  growth  rate  of  domestic \nelectricity demand is expected to be about 4.7% annually through 2015.  \n ", "2   \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Challenges \n7.  While the country has been successful in engaging the private sector for developing and \nexporting its oil and gas resources, the domestic power sector is threatened by unreliable and \ninadequate  power  supply  mainly  because  of  deterioration  of  power  facilities,  inadequate \nmaintenance  and  rehabilitation,  inadequate  investment,  and  inefficient  utilization  of  energy \nresources.  This  undermines  industrial  competitiveness  and  constrains  economic  growth. \nEffective generation capacity has shrunk because of insufficient funds for rehabilitation and \ncapacity addition. Low power plant efficiency and high losses of transmission and distribution \nlead to wastage of fossil fuels that could have been exported, and nearly double the emissions \nof greenhouse gas and other pollutants that damage the regional and global environment. \n \n8.  Deterioration of Power Facilities. Over 20% of all energy equipment and over half of \nthe network facilities are well beyond their useful life. This inevitably reduces the reliability and \nefficiency of the power network operation. The high level of physical wear of the equipment at \npower plants and networks leads to frequent power failures in populated areas and affects \neconomic activities. The inadequate capacity of transmission lines also results in a shortage of \nreserves in the stability of the power system, increasing the potential risk of power system \noperation. \n \n9.  Inadequate  Maintenance  and  Rehabilitation. The power sector has suffered from \ninadequate funding to perform essential maintenance functions and introduce new technology. \nThe result has been a distinct deterioration in the quality of the infrastructure and associated \ndeterioration in the quality of service. The power grid is becoming increasingly exposed to the \nrisk  of  systemic  collapse.  Rehabilitation  and  upgrading  of  transmission  facilities  could \nsignificantly reduce the risk of system failure. \n \n10.  Inefficient Utilization of Energy Resources. Another prominent problem of the power \nnetwork  is  the  shortage  of  peak  power  supply.  Hydropower  plants,  with  only  19%  of  the \navailable capacity of all power generation and lower reliability caused by aging of equipment, \ncannot meet peak demands adequately. Large thermal power plants have to participate in the \nshifting operation, thus reducing the efficiency and stability of generating units and excessive \nconsumption of fuels. Because of lack of sufficient peak power supply, Azerenergy has to import \npower from abroad in the peak hours as well as the winter season with higher demand. \n \n11.  Insufficient  and  Unreliable  Power  Supply. Today, about 49% of the Azerbaijan\u2019s \n8.5 million people live in rural areas, often with insufficient access to quality basic services. Lack \nof sufficient power, gas, and heat has aggravated the regional imbalance in the country. Poor \nquality and unreliable electricity supply inhibits industrial, agricultural, and commercial activities, \nconstraining economic growth and employment opportunities in regional areas. The unreliability \nof electricity supply remains a constraint to business operation and daily life. Almost 7% of total \nannual sales were lost because of power outages. Some areas of the country receive only a few \nhours of electricity a day, and there are frequent localized outages and occasional widespread \nsystem  failures.  Detailed  analysis of  the  power  sector is  in  Appendix  2  and  problem  tree \nanalysis is in Appendix 3. \n \n12.  Government Strategies and Policies. The principle objectives of the power sector \ndevelopment are to utilize domestic energy resources efficiently, protect the country\u2019s energy \nsecurity, and ensure the delivery of reliable and adequate electricity services for sustained \neconomic growth. To accelerate the power sector reform and development, the Government \n \n ", "  3\nhas set the overall policy framework for the power sector development, which has the following \ncomponents: (i) sector restructuring to separate the ownership and management of generation; \ntransmission, and distribution; (ii) development of a regulatory framework and institutions to \npromote competition and ensure the financial viability of sector enterprises; (iii) introduction of \ntargeted social protection programs to mitigate the impact of higher tariffs on vulnerable groups; \nand (iv) involvement of the private sector in the operation and financing of generation and \ndistribution facilities. Since 2005, the Government has been implementing reforms in the utilities \nand  infrastructure  sectors,  through  financial  restructuring  of  the  large  natural  monopolies; \nseparation of commercial and regulatory functions; and introduction of a proper regulatory \nframework. Progress on sector restructuring has been achieved, including establishment of four \nregional distribution companies, private sector operation in generation, and creation of the \nMinistry of Economic Development responsible for energy sector policy making, pricing and \ntariffs, licensing, and management of fixed assets. The Tariff Council, chaired by the Ministry of \nEconomic  Development,  has  authority  to  propose  tariff  adjustments,  define  customer \ncategories, and adopt cost-reflective tariff design. Furthermore, the Government has ordered \nthat all large companies have to change to international financial reporting standards (IFRS) by \nJanuary 2008, and all government ministries have to implement the IFRS by January 2009. This \nwill be under the management and control of the Ministry of Finance. \n \n13.  The Government recognizes the importance of using energy resources efficiently, and \nacknowledges that the delivery of affordable utility service of acceptable quality is an essential \nrequirement in enhancing the living standards of the population. Consequently, the Government \nhas developed a state program for development of fuel and energy sector in Azerbaijan (2005\u2013\n2015),1 which identifies and sets development targets for the various subsectors.  \n \n14.  The  state  program  envisages  the  development  of  the  power  sector  and  plans  to \nrestructure the sector, expand generation and transmission facilities, and introduce a modern \nmanagement system, including (i) development of new combined cycle gas turbine generation \nunits and hydropower generation capacities; (ii) modernization and reconstruction of power \nfacilities\u2014increasing efficiency and prolonging useful life and expanding available capacities; \n(iii) promoting the development of small hydropower and other renewable energy sources (wind \nand  solar)  to  supplement  the  energy  balance;  (iv)  construction  of  new  substations  and \ntransmission lines to expand transmission and distribution networks; (v) reconstruction and \nupgrade of dispatch control systems; (vi) strengthening cross-border links with Russian and \nIranian grids to increase power trade capacity; (vii) increasing investments for energy sector \ndevelopment and attracting foreign investments; and (viii) expanding regional cooperation and \nparticipating in the formation of regional energy markets. \n \n15.  The  Government  has  established  a  medium-term  tariff  policy  that  incorporates  a \ntransition to full cost recovery for utility service providers by 2010, to make the power sector \nfinancially self-sustainable. As the economy continues to expand, the purchasing power of the \npopulation will continue to increase and, with it, the capacity to pay higher prices for utility \nservices. In addition, the development and implementation of a targeted social safety net that is \nunder way will ensure that the most vulnerable continue to be able to afford essential utility \nservices as prices rise towards, and eventually reach full cost recovery levels. Taking into \naccount  these  considerations  and  under  joint  efforts  from  development  partners,  the \nGovernment  took  a  number  of  measures  to curtail implicit  energy subsidies,  including  the \nincrease in energy and utilities prices in January 2007. The current wholesale electricity tariff is \nAZN0.041 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) ($0.051 per kWh) and the retail electricity tariff is AZN0.06 \n                                                 \n1  Cabinet of Ministers. 2005.

This led to a reduction in energy subsidies from 21% in 2006 to an \nestimated 11% in 2007. Azerenergy has confirmed that no subsidies will be received for 2008. \nThe collection of utility payments has also been substantially improved from about 40% to 90%. \nThe implementation of the proposed Project will further improve the power sector performance \nand assist the Government to achieve its committed reform agenda. \n \n2.  Opportunities \n \n16.  An unreliable and inefficient power network is a bottleneck to sustained economic growth \nand rapid poverty reduction. With support from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other \ndevelopment partners, a comprehensive energy sector road map2 was prepared in 2006, which \nidentified  three  key  areas  for  ADB  assistance:  (i)  rehabilitation  of  the  power  grid  for \nimprovement of power supply quality and loss reduction, (ii) development of renewable energy, \nand  (iii)  improvement  of  demand-side  energy  efficiency  and  energy  conservation.  The \nGovernment expressed interest in cooperation with ADB to address these matters, and ADB is \nexploring suitable investment projects through public and private sector operation. The power \ntransmission  subsector  in  Azerbaijan  has  substantial  investment  demand  in  terms  of \nstrengthening the backbone power grid, reducing losses and enhancing energy efficiency, and \nminimizing environmental impacts. State-of-the-art technology will also be needed to transfer \npower with minimal losses and provide adequate power supply to consumers. \n \n17.  The 220 kV Mingechevir-1 transmission line was put into service in 1949, and the \nMingechevir-2 transmission line in 1954. These two single circuit transmission lines provide the \ntransmission of electric power with a total capacity of 250 MW from Mingechevir hydropower \nstation to the Absheron economic region, which is closest to the capital city of Baku and has the \nhighest electricity consumption. Both lines were partially renovated in the 1980s. However, most \nsegments remain unchanged, with a large number of defective pylons, insulators, and wires, \nleading to increased power losses and higher voltage drops. A large number of foundations of \ntowers were damaged as a result of landslides and floods. Statistical analysis of power failures \nconcluded that the technical conditions of both lines are inadequate and past their useful life. In \naddition, increased power demand causes these lines to be frequently overloaded, which leads \nto an increase of 6%\u20137% in losses, with frequent outages (8\u201317 times annually). Therefore, the \ntransmission capacity must be expanded to deliver adequate and reliable power supply. The \npower system studies concluded that construction of a new double circuit 220 kV transmission \nline to replace the aged existing lines used for 60 years would be the most suitable and least-\ncost option, which will increase transmission capacity by 300 MW and reduce power losses by \n25 GWh. The increase in transmission capacity will remove the bottleneck of the transmission \ncapacity of the backbone power networks. It is expected that by 2012, the total annual electricity \nsupply in the project area could be increased by about 1,000 GWh accordingly. The electricity \nenergy generated from the Mingechevir hydropower plant could also be increased by 200 GWh \nannually, from 1,200 GWh to 1,400 GWh. \n \n18.  The power supply in the central region is provided through the 110 kV transmission lines \nfrom Akhsu 220/110 kV substation, covering Akhsu, Ujar, Geokchai, and other administrative \nregions with a total population of 0.5 million. The majority of these transmission lines were built \nin the 1950s\u20131960s and are now overloaded, with considerable risks including low voltage in \ndistribution networks, high losses, and frequent outages. In peak hours, the voltage of the \ndistribution network is only 92\u201394 kV, or 85% of the standards, lower than the minimum allowed \nvoltage (104.5 kV) for normal operating conditions. Azerenergy has studied various options for \nreliable power supply in the central region, including construction of new thermal power plants, \n                                                 \n2  Valiyev, Vilayat. 2006.

External Assistance  \n \n19.  The major sources of external assistance in the power sector include the European Bank \nfor Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), Islamic Development Bank (IsDB), Japan Bank \nfor International Cooperation (JBIC), German development cooperation through Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr \nWiederaufbau (KfW), and the World Bank. External assistance has focused on support for gas-\nfired  and  hydropower  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  projects.  The  World  Bank \nhelped  to  improve  the  management  of  the  energy  system  and  restructure  the  relevant \ninstitutions. EBRD provided two loans for the rehabilitation of two hydropower plants, and the \nGovernment of Japan provided two loans to finance the gas combined-cycle power plant. KfW \nalso provided a loan for the power transmission rehabilitation program.  \n \n20.  Besides  these,  ADB,  EBRD,  European  Union,  and  the  World  Bank  have  provided \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  for  feasibility  studies  and  capacity  development.  ADB  has  been \nactively involved in policy dialogue with the Government since 2005. A project preparatory TA3 \nfor renewable energy development was implemented successfully, which assessed the potential \nand options for renewable energy development and identified pilot small hydropower projects to \nbe developed. The TA also assessed the government policy framework, developed a road map \nfor implementation of renewable energy projects, and prepared a standardized power purchase \nagreement  and  other  policy  documents.  The  Government  is  considering  adopting  an \nappropriate investment modality and identifying the implementing agency, and will seek ADB\u2019s \ncontinued support. \n21.  The World Bank assistance focuses on the establishment of a full cost recovery tariff \npolicy, implementing IFRS, creating an appropriate regulatory environment, and strengthening \nprivate participation in the provision of utility services. The European Union is also supporting \nthe Ministry of Industry and Energy to enhance its capacity to develop and implement a national \nenergy strategy and public sector reform for attracting foreign investments for infrastructure \ndevelopment.  \n \n22.  The Project was prepared and will be implemented in coordination with the external aid \nagencies active in the power sector. During project processing, ADB\u2019s project team frequently \nconsulted with counterparts on policy reforms, project design, and capacity development in the \nsector.  The  Project  will  complement  the  ongoing  assistance  programs,  improve  the \neffectiveness  of  external  assistance,  and  synergize  the  institutional  strengthening  of \nAzerenergy. \n \n23.  Through  the  synergized  external  assistance  from  international  financing  agencies, \nseveral key policy initiatives have resulted. The Government has adopted and approved a \npreliminary energy sector strategy and policy framework, established a full cost recovery tariff \npolicy, and is continually improving sector governance. Sound procurement procedures and a \nfinancial management and audit system have been introduced in the energy sector. Details of \nexternal assistance to the power sector are in Appendix 4.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2005.

The energy sector was identified as a priority area for ADB interventions. The 2006 \ncountry strategy and program update for Azerbaijan4 indicated that the Government requested \nADB support for energy within an expanded lending program. The proposed power transmission \nproject is under the Government strategic priority, and is in line with ADB\u2019s country strategy and \nenergy policy.5  \n \n25.  ADB has no lending operations in the Azerbaijan energy sector yet and the Project \nprovides a unique opportunity to enter it. Currently, private sector funding in Azerbaijan is not \nsufficient to fully rehabilitate the power system. ADB can contribute to fill the funding gap and \nwork with the Government and development partners to improve the structural, legal, and \nregulatory framework needed to attract private sector funding in the sector. ADB has extensive \nexperience in the design and implementation of transmission projects in its developing member \ncountries, with lessons that are directly applicable to Azerbaijan. The Project will complement \nother ADB support for infrastructure, including the development of roads and regional towns. \n \n26.  The Project targets key strategic transmission lines, which are severely deteriorated and \nneed to be rehabilitated on a priority basis. It will also contribute to optimizing domestic energy \nresource  utilization  and  reducing  fossil  fuel  consumption  and  power  imports.  The  current \nAzerbaijan power system is not being operated optimally because of constraints on existing \ncomponents of the transmission network. Hydropower energy generated in the west region is \nnot delivered efficiently to the central region where demand is increasing rapidly. Replacement \nof the 220 kV transmission lines would allow the existing Mingechevir hydropower plant (360 \nMW) to increase its available outputs to the optimal level (420 MW)\u2014peak power supply could \nbe efficiently enhanced, while power energy generated from the gas and oil fired plants in the \ncentral and east regions could be reduced. This would permit optimal utilization of the grid \nnetworks and generation capacity by reducing the shifting operation time of large thermal power \nplants, thus improving the efficiency and stability of generation units and reducing excessive \nconsumption of fuels. The saved fuels including gas and oil would be exported to increase \ngovernment revenue. Therefore, Azerenergy and the country would benefit from savings in fuel \nexpenditures, improved energy efficiency, and reduced environmental pollution. \n \n27.  Azerbaijan has actively participated in Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation. \nThe Government is also involved in ADB regional TA on promoting renewable energy, energy \nefficiency, and greenhouse gas abatement; and has committed itself to exploring the use of \nrenewable energy as part of its generation expansion.6 Implementation of the proposed Project \nis helping to reinforce the relationship between Azerbaijan and ADB in the energy sector, and \nestablish the conditions for expansion of long-term cooperation.  \n \n5.  Lessons Learned \n \n28.  ADB has not yet provided loans to the energy sector of Azerbaijan. Nevertheless, ADB \nhas  accumulated  substantial  experience  in  implementation  of  infrastructure  projects  and \nunderstanding of problems in the energy sector in other countries in the region. Relevant \nlessons learned are that (i) project components shall be carefully designed and evaluated based \non  in-depth  technical,  economic,  environmental,  and  social  (including  land  acquisition  and \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2006.

In addition, early attention on procurement matters, \nincluding bid documents preparation and review procedures, will be given to avoid delays. Close \nfollow-up during project engineering designs, construction of civil works, and installation should \nensure timely corrective measures where needed and early completion of project components. \n \n29.  Azerbaijan  has  embarked  on  energy  sector  reforms.  However,  the  process  of \nrestructuring, legal and regulatory reforms, and enhancement of utility financial performances is \na progression that is mainly being supported by other development partners, including the World \nBank  and  the  European  Union.  The  Project  would  complement  these  efforts  with  needed \ninvestment in transmission network enhancement. This integration of policy and investment \nsupport is designed to maximize their combined effect on the sector's financial position and \nsustainability of sector reforms. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n30.  The Project was developed following technical, economic, and financial studies that \nhave taken into consideration environmental and social aspects. The proposed Project will \nconstruct a double circuit 220 kV transmission line with a total length of 280 km between \nMingechevir hydropower plant and the 500/330/220 kV Absheron substation to replace the \nexisting 220 kV transmission lines. It will also construct a 220/110 kV substation at Agdash and \nexpand Absheron substation. The new 220 kV transmission line will be built at the same corridor \nof  the  existing  old  lines,  and  the  latter  lines  will  be  demolished  before  and  during  the \nconstruction of new lines. The existing power supply will be shifted to other transmission lines \nand the deficient parts will be supplied from increase of imported power. \n \n31.  The Project aims to facilitate the country\u2019s economic development by strengthening \ninfrastructure development, removing the bottleneck of power transmission, and improving the \nefficiency of services. The project impacts are to improve the power transmission system to \nprovide reliable and adequate electricity for sustained economic growth. It will strengthen the \nbackbone power transmission network in the west-to-east direction, which is crucial for ensuring \nthe required stability of power supply to consumers in the key Azeri industrial and economic \nhub. The Project is an integral part of Azerbaijan\u2019s power sector development strategy. \n \n32.  The project outcome will be an expanded and strengthened backbone 220 kV power \ntransmission  and  distribution  network  with  transmission  bottlenecks  removed  and  losses \nreduced. \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n33.  The outputs of the Project are summarized below:  \n \n(i)  220 kV transmission line. Construction of 220 kV double-circuit transmission \nline  from  Mingechevir  hydropower  plant  to  Absheron  substation  with  a  total \nlength of about 280 km. The new transmission line will increase the transmission \n   ", "8   \ncapacity by 300 MW, remove the bottlenecks of backbone transmission network, \nand reduce the transmission losses. \n \n(ii)  Agdash substation (220/110 kV).

Financing Plan \n35.  Azerenergy has requested a loan of $160 million from ADB from its ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the Project. The ADB loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum, and \nsuch  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  guarantee  agreements. \nAzerenergy has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking \nthat  these  choices  were  its  own  independent  decision  not  made  in  reliance  on  any \ncommunication or advice from ADB. The Government of Azerbaijan will provide the sovereign \nguarantee. The foreign exchange risk will be borne by the Borrower. Azerenergy will finance the \nremaining  costs  including  consulting  services,  local  taxes  and  duties,  interest  during \nconstruction,  and  contingencies,  from  its  own  resources  of  an  estimated  $80  million.

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n36.  Azerenergy will be the executing agency. Azerenergy has been the executing agency for \nsix investment projects financed by the World Bank, EBRD, KfW, IsDB, and JBIC. The capacity \nof Azerenergy and its staff to undertake the project implementation responsibilities is considered \nsatisfactory, given their adequate experience with previous projects and the staff\u2019s technical \nskills.  A  financial  management  assessment  was  undertaken  during  project  preparation, \nindicating that Azerenergy has satisfactory management capacity and systems for financial and \naccounting management, reporting, auditing, and internal controls. \n \n37.  A project management unit (PMU) will be established, headed by a project manager and \nstaffed by specialists in technical, financial, procurement, social, and environmental matters. \nThe PMU will report to the chief engineer or deputy president of Azerenergy. The PMU will be \nresponsible  for  day-to-day  project  implementation,  comprising  procurement,  contract \nsupervision  and  management,  project  social  and  environmental  management,  and  project \nfinancial management, including project accounting, financial reporting, loan disbursements, \nand arrangements for external audits. Relevant international practices and standards will be \nadhered to in the implementation of the Project. Detailed construction and installation drawings \nwill be available under the Project and will be in line with specifications in the engineering, \nprocurement, and commissioning contracts. \n \n \n \n   ", "10   \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n38.  The Project will be implemented around 3 years starting in January 2009. Physical works \nare expected to be completed by the end of 2011 and the loan utilization period will be up to \nJune 2012. Detailed engineering designs, surveys, investigations, will start in the fourth quarter \nof 2008. The civil works are expected to commence in the second quarter of 2009. The project \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 6. \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n39.  ADB-financed goods and services will be procured according to ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). International competitive bidding procedures \nwill  be  followed  for  civil  work  contracts  costing  $3  million  equivalent  or  more.  Contracts \nestimated at less than $3 million will be awarded using national competitive bidding under \nAzerbaijan\u2019s  Public  Procurement  Law  of  27  December  2001  and  acceptable  to  ADB.  The \nprocurement plan will be updated at least annually, covering the next 18 months of procurement \nactivity. The procurement plan is in Appendix 7. \n \n40.  The operation of transmission lines and substations is highly integrated because of \ntechnical specifications. Proper system performance of the transmission and substation facilities \nalso  requires  strong  integration  between  the  equipment  suppliers  and  the  construction \ncontractors. The successful bidder will be required to warrant performance of the lines and \nelectrical equipment, which reduces the risk to Azerenergy. Therefore, a plant design, supply, \nand install (turnkey) contracting approach has been taken to ensure proper system design \nintegration and facility performance. A plant contracting approach also has the advantage of \nensuring that the contractor has adequate experience of civil works requirements and in-depth \nknowledge of equipment to be installed, and can ensure better design integration. To facilitate \nproject implementation and administration in a more efficient and economical manner, the \nproject subcomponents are packaged into one single plant (turnkey) contract. This approach will \nbe more likely to attract more qualified national and international bidders and lower bid prices \nbecause of the award of multiple subcomponents.     \n \n41.  The  single  plant  (turnkey)  contract  for  construction  of  the  transmission  line  and \nsubstation facilities will be awarded using international competitive bidding following ADB\u2019s \nstandard bidding document: single-stage bidding procedure. \n \n4.  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n \n42.  To  expedite  project  implementation,  Azerenergy  has  requested  ADB  approval  for \nadvance contracting for the ADB-financed components. This will enable Azerenergy to initiate \nthe procurement process.  \n \n43.  Azerenergy has also requested ADB for retroactive financing for expenditures in respect \nof civil works if incurred prior to effectiveness of the loan agreement. Reimbursement by ADB of \nany payments made by Azerenergy under the contract will not exceed 20% of the loan amount \nprovided  that  expenditures  are  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  and \nsafeguard policies, and were incurred not earlier than 12 months prior to signing of the loan \nagreement. The Government and Azerenergy have been advised that approval of advance \ncontracting and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to financing the Project. \n \n \n ", "  11\n5.  Consulting Services \n \n44.  Consulting services will be required for project implementation support and capacity \ndevelopment. Key tasks include (i) procurement and bidding for the tendering of plant design, \nsupply, and installation contracts; (ii) supervision of construction, testing and commissioning, \nand  quality  assurance;  (iii)  monitoring  of  project  implementation  and  performance;  and \n(iv) capacity  development.  The  capacity  development  component  will  involve  project \nmanagement and monitoring activities, including safeguards monitoring and evaluation, and \ntraining on transmission system operations, and maintenance. The outline terms of reference for \nproject implementation consultants are in Appendix 8. \n \n45.  Because of the power system operation requirement, Azerenergy plans to complete the \nconstruction of transmission and substation facilities by the end of 2011. To expedite project \nimplementation, Azerenergy will finance the project implementation consultants entirely from its \nown resources, and engage the consultants in accordance with its procedures acceptable to \nADB. DECON,7 an international consulting firm, has been engaged by Azerenergy through \ninternational  competitive  bidding  under  a  transmission  line  project  financed  by  KfW.  The \nconsultants  have  adequate  professional  qualifications  and  satisfactory  performance  in  the \nassignment.  The  consulting  services  under  the  Project  represent  a  very  similar  technical \napproach  and  professional  expertise  with  the  ongoing  assignment.  Azerenergy  intends  to \nengage this firm directly through negotiation. The consulting firm has submitted technical and \nfinancial proposals based on the terms of reference. This single-source selection approach is \nconsidered appropriate and cost-effective, given that (i) the consultants are selected based on \ninternational competitive bidding and have the necessary professional qualifications, (ii) the \nconsultants will carry out the assignment in accordance with the agreed schedule, and (iii) the \nscope of the services is consistent with the needs of the Project. The consultant\u2019s experience \nand competence have been assessed and found adequate to the proposed assignment. \n \n6.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n46.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith Azerenergy and the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \nloan regulations and bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by \nADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit \nand examine the records and accounts of all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other \nservice providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n47.  The  Government  and  Azerenergy  agreed  to  take  additional  measures  to  improve \ngovernance,  accountability,  and  transparency  under  the  Project.  These  measures  include \n(i) independent  external  auditing  of  contracts,  project  accounts,  and  financial  statements; \n(ii) decisions on all procurement-related matters being taken by the tendering committee, which \ncomprises  representatives  of  the  Ministry  of  Economic  Development,  Ministry  of  Finance, \nMinistry of Industry and Energy, and State Procurement Agency; (iii) verification of contractors\u2019 \npayment  claims  by  the  supervision  consultant  in  accordance  with  contract  specifications; \n(iv) timely disclosure of information on selection of consultants and contractors through local \n                                                 \n7  DECON, a European consulting firm with headquarters in Germany, has a 35-year history of implementing more \nthan 700 projects at home and abroad.

To reduce cash flow difficulties in Azerenergy \nand facilitate project implementation, the imprest account procedures described in ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook will be followed. An imprest account will be established at the National \nBank  of  Azerbaijan  or  a  commercial  bank  in  Azerbaijan  acceptable  to  ADB  after  loan \neffectiveness,  and  will  be  liquidated  and  replenished  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook. The total advance will not exceed ADB\u2019s estimated share of eligible \nproject expenditures to be financed through the imprest account for the next 6 months, or 10% \nof the amount of the loan, whichever is lower. For simplified documentation, the statement of \nexpenditures procedure, as described in the Loan Disbursement Handbook, will be followed to \nreimburse expenditures and liquidate the imprest account for any individual payment transaction \nof $100,000 equivalent and below. \n \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n49.  Azerenergy  agreed  to  adhere  to  sound  financial  management  requirements  during \nimplementation of the Project. Azerenergy will maintain separate project records and accounts \nadequate to identify the (i) goods and services financed from the loan proceeds, (ii) financing \nresources received, (iii) expenses incurred on the components of the Project, and (iv) use of \ncounterpart funds. Azerenergy will engage independent external auditors acceptable to ADB to \naudit project accounts and financial statements annually, and will arrange a periodic or annual \naudit of statement of expenditures transactions. Azerenergy will submit to ADB certified copies \nof audited annual project accounts and related financial statements as well as the auditor\u2019s \nreport in English, including the proposed use of the imprest account and the statement of \nexpenditures  procedure,  within  6  months  after  the  end  of  each  financial  year  during \nimplementation. Azerenergy was advised of ADB\u2019s requirement for timely submission of audited \nannual project accounts and financial statements, and the suspension of disbursements of the \nADB loan in case of noncompliance with the requirements. \n \n50.  Azerenergy will prepare and submit to ADB quarterly progress reports, which will include \n(i) a narrative description of progress made during the reporting period, (ii) changes in the \nimplementation schedule, (iii) problems or difficulties encountered, and (iv) activities and actions \nto be undertaken in the next reporting period. Azerenergy will prepare and submit to ADB a \nproject completion report within 3 months of project completion. \n \n9.  Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n51.   A set of targets and indicators for monitoring and evaluation of project performance \nwere discussed with Azerenergy during fact-finding (key performance targets and indicators are \nin Appendix 1). Azerenergy will (i) engage project implementation consultants for monitoring and \nevaluation by the end of 2008; (ii) collect additional data from relevant agencies, including local \ngovernments  and  statistics  bureaus,  to  measure  the  performance  indicators  at  inception, \ncompletion, and 3 years after completion of the Project; and (iii) report to ADB key findings on a \nquarterly basis. Azerenergy, with the assistance of the supervision consultant, will monitor and \nevaluate  project  impacts  to  ensure  that  the  project  facilities  are  managed  effectively  and \nbenefits maximized. \n \n ", "  13\n \n10.  Project Review \n \n52.  ADB will field an inception mission within 3 months of loan approval, and a review \nmission  every  6  months.  The  Government,  Azerenergy,  and  ADB  will  jointly  undertake  a \nmidterm  review  in  late  2009.  The  midterm  review  will  focus  on  (i)  project  impacts, \n(ii) implementation progress, (iii) sector reform and performance, (iv) performance of consultants \nand contractors, (v) status of compliance with covenants in the loan agreement, and (vi) the \nneed  for  any  midcourse  changes  in  the  scope  or  schedule  of  the  Project  to  ensure  full \nachievement of its impact. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Economic Analysis \n53.  The proposed Project will need to demonstrate economic viability and sustainability in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.8 \n \n54.  Economic  analysis  of  Azerenergy\u2019s  proposed  Project  under  the  state  program  for \ndevelopment of fuel and energy sector in Azerbaijan (2005\u20132015) has been carried out in \naccordance  with  the  Guidelines  for  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects.  Azerenergy  identifies \nbenefits to the replacement transmission line that are within the context of the state program for \nenergy transmission. However, there is no numerical analysis to support these benefits other \nthan that the Project will increase the capacity of the power network and reduce losses of \ncapacity and electric energy. The issue of lack of peak capacity was also identified, which \nrequires that peak demand is met by importing energy from the Russian Federation. It is on this \nbasis that the justification of the replacement transmission lines is proposed, by evaluating the \navoidable cost of the imported peak power. The Project has an estimated economic internal rate \nof return (EIRR) of 14.8%, indicating that it is economically viable. Sensitivity analysis revealed \nthat expected economic outcomes are robust under a range of downside scenarios, reflecting \nthe strong link between an adequate electricity supply and economic growth. A summary of the \neconomic analysis is in Appendix 9. \n \nB.  Financial Analysis  \n \n55.  Financial  analysis  of  the  Project  has  been  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nFinancial Management and Analysis of Projects.9 All financial costs and benefits have been \nexpressed at 2007 prices. Cost streams used to determine the financial internal rate of return \n(FIRR), i.e., capital investment, and operations and maintenance, reflect the cost of delivering \nthe estimated benefits. The tariff for electricity has been assumed as the difference between the \ncost of imported electricity and the cost of own generation of electricity and has been set at \n$0.036 per kWh. The tariff is applied to the volume of 650 GWh\u2014assuming that the Project will \nenable domestic generation to replace imports. \n \n56.  The FIRR of 11.69% compares favorably with the estimated weighted average cost of \ncapital (WACC) of 2.45% indicating financial viability for the Project. Financial viability was \ngauged by comparing the incremental costs and benefits of with- and without-project investment \nscenarios. The incremental benefits arise through the replacement of imported electricity and \nreduction in operating expenditures. Nonquantifiable financial benefits such as quality of power \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n9  ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n   ", "14   \nsupply were not included in the financial evaluation. A summary of the financial analysis is in \nAppendix 10. \n \n57.  Sensitivity and risk analysis indicates that the FIRRs are robust with (i) a 10% increase \nin capital costs, (ii) a 10-year benefit stream (instead of 20 years), (iii) LIBOR increasing by \n10%, and (iv) net benefits decreasing by 10%. Two extreme scenarios have also been run \nwhere both benefits and capital costs were reduced to a point where the net present value \n(NPV) of free cash flow was set to zero. Both scenarios came out with acceptable FIRRs. The \nsensitivity analysis can be found in Table 3 below. \n \nTable 3: Summary Results of Financial Analysis \n \nBenefits  LIBOR  \nBase  CAPEX  Benefit \nItem  reduced to  increase \nCase  +10%  minus 10%\n10 year  by 10% \nWACC (%)  2.45  2.45 6.75 2.45  2.45\nFIRR (%)  11.69  3.32 12.41 10.58  10.46\nNPV ($ million)  277.20  10.20 112.30 260.00  232.20\nCAPEX = capital expenditure, FIRR = financial internal rate of return, LIBOR = London interbank offered \nrate, NPV =net present value, WACC = weighted average cost of capital. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n58.  For each of the scenarios in Table 3, the FIRR is greater than the WACC and the NPV is \npositive. Therefore, it can be concluded that, in the all unlikely circumstances including the most \nnegative scenario (i) the expected benefit stream will be 10 years instead of 20 years; (ii) the \nProject is financially viable; and (iii) the company will be able to generate sufficient cash flows to \ncover the projected costs, including loan interest and principal repayment requirements. \n \n59.  Two additional scenarios have been calculated to investigate at what level the expected \nbenefits should decrease, or at what level capital expenditures should be increased to get the \nNPV to zero. The calculations show that this level will be achieved if benefits are reduced by \n60%  or  capital  expenditures  increase  more  than  2.5  times,  which  may  be  concluded  as \nextremely unlikely. \n \nC.  Financial Management and Sustainability of Azerenergy \n \n60.  Prior to the country\u2019s independence, Azerenergy was administratively a government \nagency. In 1996, it became an open joint-stock company. Although it is fully owned by the \nGovernment, and senior management is handpicked by the Government, Azerenergy enjoys \nrelative autonomous status according to its charter. The detailed corporate and organizational \nstructure of Azerenergy and its financial performance are in Supplementary Appendixes D and \nE.  \n \n61.  Azerenergy  generates  electric  power.  It  transmits  and  sells  electricity  directly  to \nconsumers as well as in bulk to power distribution companies. Based on the agreements, \ndistribution  companies  deliver  electricity  to  retail  consumers  within  their  service  areas. \nAzerenergy comprises 20 generation and transmission entities and the energy management \nnetwork; these are under the direct financial control of Azerenergy. The revenue collection of \nthese entities is centralized and managed directly by the head office of Azerenergy. The nine \nregional distribution entities and Nakhchivan autonomy agency collect their own revenue and \ntherefore pay corporate income tax as individual entities. There are also seven decentralized \nenterprises  under  the  umbrella  of  Azerenergy\u2014Research  Centre,  Construction  Enterprise, \n \n ", "  15\nRepair and Construction Enterprise, Security Service Enterprise, Supply Entity, Energy Service \nSupply Entity, and Research Institute. The total number of employees in 2007 was 8,092. \n \n62.  Two  distribution  companies\u2014Joint-Stock  Company  (JSC)  Baku  Electricshebeke  and \nJSC Sumgait Electricshebeke\u2014are outside Azerenergy management control and operate as \nseparate entities. Azerenergy concluded contracts with JSC Baku Electricshebeke and JSC \nSumgait Electricshebeke for the transmission of electricity in Baku and Sumgait cities. \n \n1.  Past Financial Performance \n \n63.  Azerenergy\u2019s overall financial performance has been satisfactory in the past 3 years and \ntotal revenue has increased steadily because of the increase in tariffs as well as the reduction in \nimported energy, thus facilitating Azerenergy to expand its investment in the sector. Azerenergy \nexperienced a growth in total revenue in 2007 (AZN934 million), increasing by 222% over 2006. \n \n64.  The company\u2019s operating results also improved during 2007 because of the overall \nincrease in tariffs. The cost of sales amounted to AZN695 million or 74% of total revenue in \n2007\u2014a significant improvement over 2006 where it was 185% of total turnover. \n \n65.  The ratio of equity to total equity and liabilities is improved slightly from 22% in 2006 to \n26% in 2007. Accordingly, the total liabilities to equity ratio also improved from 3.45 in 2006 to \n2.84 in 2007. The improvement of the company\u2019s gearing ratio is very important, and shows that \nthe company is able to earn enough capital using long-term borrowings for investment in the \nindustry. \n \n66.  In spite of significant improvement of the debt service coverage ratio which is up to 0.5 in \n2007 from 0.05 in 2006, this performance indicator is still low. The Government has been \nmaking  efforts  to  increase  tariffs  (thereby  increasing  cash  flow  available  for  debt  service) \nstarting in 2007. It is therefore believed that the debt service coverage ratio should be at a level \nacceptable when repayment starts in 2012. More detailed analysis of Azerenergy\u2019s financial \nperformance is in Appendix 11. \n \n2.  Financial Projections \n \n67.  Up to 2006, retail tariffs were set below cost and as a result, Azerenergy was receiving \nsubsidies from the Government. At the beginning of 2007, the Government made a difficult \npolitical decision to set tariffs to cover costs with a 10% return. The results have been seen in \nAzerenergy\u2019s financial statements in 2007 where sales significantly increased and subsidies \ndecreased.10 Retail tariffs increased from AZN0.017 per kWh to AZN0.060 per kWh in January \n2007. \n \n68.  It  is  projected  that  there  will  be a  gradual  improvement  in  the company\u2019s  financial \nperformance and position during the planning period from 2008 to 2015. Estimated financial \nresults  are  considerably  improved  over  that  period.  Net  profit  after  taxation  is  forecast  to \nincrease from AZN130 million in 2008 to AZN657 million in 2015. \n \n69.  Revenues are forecast to increase from AZN1.06 billion in 2008 to AZN2.34 billion in \n2015 because of a growth in production and demand, and the increase in tariffs. \n \n                                                 \n10  Subsidies for 2007 were zero; those subsidies in the 2007 statements were incurred the previous year. \n   ", "16   \n70.  The  increase  in  sales  and  general  improvement  in  performance  is  mainly  due  to \nAzerenergy and the Government\u2019s new attitude toward electricity tariffs covering Azerenergy\u2019s \ncosts. The financial projections assume that tariffs will increase at the same rate as gross \nelectricity production but will also be adjusted from time to time to meet the covenants set forth \nby  the  ADB  loan.  The  base  case  therefore  assumes  a  30%  increase  by  2012.  As  the \nGovernment increased retail tariffs by more than three times in 2007, such increase can be \nconcluded as reasonable. \n \n71.  Improvement in each of the key performance indicators during 2008\u20132015 reflect the \npositive changes forecast in the financial statements. Total equity is forecast to increase from \nAZN1.03 billion in 2008 to AZN5.05 billion in 2020, and AZN13.73 billion by 2030. \n \n72.  Because  of  careful  forecast  of  cash  disbursement,  the  repayment  of  current  trade \npayables will be only 40% in the year of purchase in 2008, 60% in 2012, and 70% in 2015, \nreaching 90% in 2020 and afterwards. It is assumed that such cash disbursement policy will be \navailable because of the Government\u2019s full control over the oil and gas companies (biggest \nsuppliers to Azerenergy). This policy enables the company to keep a positive balance of cash at \nthe end of each year during the forecast period. Projected increases in electricity sales and the \ngradual  improvement  in  cash  collections  will  lead  to  a  substantial  increase  in  cash  in \nsubsequent  years.  A  positive  cash  flow  will  allow  the  company  to  fulfill  its  commitments \n(including  the  previously  mentioned  outstanding  debts)  and  to  carry  out  self-financing  of \nrequired capital investments. \n \n3.  Financial Management Structure \n \n73.  The  financial  management  structure  of  Azerenergy  was  assessed and  found  to  be \nadequate. A financial management assessment was undertaken to ensure the current ability of \nAzerenergy  to  fulfill  ADB\u2019s  fiduciary  requirements  under  the  proposed  loan.  A  financial \nmanagement assessment questionnaire was completed by Azerenergy to facilitate a review of \nits financial systems and processes, and to identify any issues or constraints. Azerenergy\u2019s \nmanagement assessment is in Appendix 12. \n \n74.  Azerenergy currently maintains its accounting and reporting procedures in accordance \nwith Azerbaijan\u2019s Accounting Regulations. However, significant steps have been taken for the \nadoption  of  IFRS.  Azerenergy  prepared  a  draft  new  accounting  policy  and  new  chart  of \naccounts to meet IFRS requirements. Preparatory work for the reconciliation of all expositing \naccounts to the new accounts is currently being carried out. The management of Azerenergy \nassumes that the new accounting policies and procedures will be adopted in the company \nduring the year. However, there are significant obstacles in disseminating the new policies \namong the accounting staff of the company\u2019s subsidiaries. The level of qualification of the \naccountants is varied in different regions of the country.  \n \n         D.  Environmental Assessment \n \n75.  The Project has no major environmental impacts. A minor impact on nature is that of \nwhite  storks  (ciconia  ciconia),  which  have  built  nests  on  transmission  towers  near  the \nTurianchay Reserve. It is recommended that the Project avoid these during the breeding season \nand then move the nests to the newly constructed towers or specially built nesting towers. \nSpecial handling will be required with respect to toxic polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in \ntransformer oil. This includes one old transformer containing PCBs, which will be removed for \nuse elsewhere. The Project will require an assurance from Azerenergy that the new transformer \n \n ", "  17\nwill be filled with a nontoxic substitute for PCB. Azerbaijan does not have specific laws or \nregulations on handling of PCBs but is a signatory to the Stockholm Convention, thus the terms \nof the convention and United Nations guidelines detailing safe handling and prevention of PCB \nemissions are to be followed.  \n \n76.  Project  implementation  will  require  environmental  monitoring  as  detailed  in  the \nenvironmental  management  and  monitoring  plan  (EMMP)  to  avoid  standard  construction \nimpacts.  These  include  environmental  standard  operating  procedures  such  as  cleaning  up \nconstruction sites, proper disposal of spoils, grading damaged land and replanting vegetation, \nprotecting the public from excessive noise and dust during construction, etc. With respect to \nhandling PCBs, Azerenergy will need to coordinate with the Ministry of Ecology and Natural \nResources (MENR) as the government agency responsible for handling hazardous materials \nand to engage the services of the specialized hazardous materials company established by \nMENR. \n \nE.  Social Safeguards \n \n77.  Resettlement. The new 280 km transmission line will pass inside the corridor of the old \nlines, with the new towers sited in principle on the same bases of the old ones. As the line \ncorridor is already formally owned by Azerenergy, no land acquisition will be needed. Based on \nexisting agreements, no land compensation will be given to farmers that may be affected by the \nfew  towers  that  may  require  new  bases  following  detailed  design.11 By  regulation,  the \ntransmission line may require the removal of a few houses already existing within the corridor \nand may cause temporary impacts to crops (wheat) cultivated under various transmission line \nsections for a total of some 130 km.12 To avoid these impacts as required by the ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995), Azerenergy has agreed to (i) allow the permanence of \nexisting  houses  under  the  lines;  (ii)  schedule  construction  in  farmed  areas  during  the \nnonagricultural season (from June to September); and (iii) reflect these provisions in the civil \nworks contracts. Based on this, the Project is classified category C and no resettlement plan \nwas prepared. However, to guarantee that the transmission line construction plan and schedule \nneeded to avoid impacts is adopted, Azerenergy has prepared a detailed due diligence report \nproviding  all  needed  qualitative  and  quantitative  background  on  potential  project  impacts, \ndetailing all provisions needed to avoid them, and indicating the result of a consultation process \ncarried out among selected communities farming land under the lines. To cover all possibilities, \nthe  due  diligence  report  also  details  the  project  implementation  conditions  and  the  action \nneeded to satisfy ADB policy requirements on compensation if the adopted impact avoidance \nmeasures cannot be implemented because of force majeure. \n \n78.  Indigenous Peoples. The areas crossed by the transmission lines are all occupied by \ncommunities belonging to the Azeri national majority. This Project will thus not trigger the ADB \nPolicy on Indigenous Peoples (1998); it will be classified category C and will not require the \npreparation of an indigenous peoples development plan. The summary poverty reduction and \nsocial strategy is in Appendix 13. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n11  Based on existing agreements, Azerenergy allows local farmers to cultivate land under the line but retains the right \nto reclaim the right to use the corridor if needed.   \n12  The remaining length of the line passes over desert, steppe, or grassland areas where no impact to livelihood will \noccur. \n   ", "18   \nF.  Assumptions and Risks \n \n79.  The Project was designed based on the following key assumptions: (i) macroeconomic \ngrowth remains stable, (ii) the Government remains committed to power sector reforms and \ndevelopment, (iii) the Government is commitment to establishing cost-recovering tariffs, (iv) \nAzerenergy is committed to implementation of social and environmental mitigation measures in \na  timely  manner,  (v)  project  and  financial  management  of  Azerenergy  is  sound,  and  (vi) \ncounterpart financing is adequate. \n \n80.  Risks to the Project include (i) an unexpected increase in prices of commodities and raw \nmaterials, (ii) a delay in procurement and recruitment of consultants caused by government \napprovals, and (iii) delays in implementation of social and environmental mitigation measures. \nThe Project is fully supported by the Government, and the cabinet of ministers will coordinate \nthe work of government agencies to ensure that any issues are resolved promptly. Adequate \nconsulting  services  are  provided  to  help  Azerenergy  manage  implementation,  monitor \nperformance, and report to ADB. Price contingency funds are included to respond to unforeseen \ncost  changes.  Azerenergy  is  also  committed  to  implement  the  social  and  environmental \nmitigation  measures  fully,  and  relevant  provisions  will  be  incorporated  in  the  civil  works \ncontracts. \n \n81.  The project financial risk is low. There is clear evidence that the Government has had \nconsiderable success in the transition to full cost recovery for the power utility by 2010. The \nGovernment also confirmed that no subsidies will be given to Azerenergy from 2008. Tariff \nreform has significantly supported the target of achieving a financially self-sustainable power \nsector. The proposed Project, together with efforts from other development partners, will have a \nsynergized  effect  on  enhancing  Azerenergy\u2019s  financial  performance  and  will  assist  the \nGovernment to achieve its committed reform agenda.  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n82.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and Azerenergy have given the \nfollowing assurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n83.  Counterpart Support.  Azerenergy will make available the funds, facilities, services, \nland, and other resources, as required, for timely implementation and operation of the Project.  \n \n84.  Financial Management:  \n \n(i)  Azerenergy  will  ensure  that  ADB  is  kept  informed  about  the  Government\u2019s  \nannouncement on the implementation of tariff policy reform, and it will implement \nthe tariff policy in accordance with its terms and defined timetable, which will \nenable  Azerenergy  to  achieve  its  full  cost  recovery  of  its  operations  by  31 \nDecember 2010.  \n \n(ii)  Within 6 months following the end of each financial year, Azerenergy will submit \nto ADB (a) the IFRS consolidated financial statements of the company and its \nsubsidiaries, audited by an international auditing firm acceptable to ADB, and \n(b) audited financial statements in respect of the Project.  \n \n(iii)  Within 3 months of the end of each financial year, Azerenergy will compute its \ndebt service coverage ratio and gearing ratio for each such financial year, and \n \n ", "  19\nsubmit these to ADB; and from the year 2012 onwards, Azerenergy will maintain \nthe debt service coverage ratio of not less than 1.5, and the gearing ratio of not \nmore than 70%.  \n \n85.  Environment. Azerenergy will ensure that (i) the Project is designed, constructed, and \noperated in accordance with Azerbaijan\u2019s applicable laws and regulations, ADB\u2019s Environment \nPolicy (2002) and the initial environmental examination (IEE); (ii) any adverse environmental \nimpacts are minimized by undertaking the mitigating measures detailed in the EMMP as set out \nin the IEE; (iii) implementation of the EMMP and any violation of environmental standards are \nreported semiannually to ADB; (iv) the EMMP is incorporated in bidding documents and bills of \nquantities of the civil work contracts; (v) the EMMP is updated after detailed design and due \ndiligence,  with  prior  approval  of  ADB;  and  (vi)  all  environmental  permits,  licenses,  and \nclearances are obtained in a timely manner prior to commencement of civil works in the relevant \nsection of the Project. \n \n86.  Azerenergy will ensure that the handling of transformers and PCBs adheres to the terms \nof the Stockholm Convention, of which the Government is a signatory, and with United Nations \nprocedures for safe handling of PCBs. Azerenergy will ensure that the new transformers are \nfilled with a nontoxic substitute for PCB. Azerenergy will coordinate the handling of transformers \nand PCBs with MENR as the agency responsible for hazardous materials. \n \n87.  Resettlement. Azerenergy will ensure that (i) the Project does not require any land \nacquisition or involuntary resettlement; (ii) the new transmission lines and towers follow the \nexisting  alignment  and  locations,  respectively;  (iii)  before  commencement  of  civil  works,  a \ndetailed due diligence report is completed on potential social impacts and submitted to ADB for \napproval; (iv) in the event any land acquisition or resettlement becomes necessary, or any \npotential impact on indigenous peoples is identified, a suitable resettlement plan is drawn up in \nconsultation with the affected people, and approval of ADB, in accordance with the applicable \nlaws  of  the  Republic  of  Azerbaijan,  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy,  and  Policy  on \nIndigenous Peoples, and is implemented in accordance with its terms; (v) the existing houses \nunder the transmission lines remain intact during project implementation; (vi) the construction is \nscheduled in the farm areas only during the nonagricultural season (June to September); and \n(vii) these provisions are incorporated suitably in the bidding documents and made part of the \ncivil works contracts. \n \n88.   Change of Ownership and Operation. In the event a change is proposed (i) in the \nownership or control of the Project, Azerenergy will, at least 6 months prior to implementation of \nsuch  a  proposal,  consult  with  ADB  and  obtain  its  consent;  and  (ii)  in  the  ownership  of \nAzerenergy,  the  Government  will  consult  with  ADB  to  ensure  that  it  does  not  affect  the \nimplementation of the Project or the terms of the loan agreement. \n \n89.  Government.

Overview  \n1.  Azerbaijan is rich in diverse and abundant energy resources. The overall volume of the \ncountry\u2019s hydrocarbon reserves is estimated at 4 billion tons of oil equivalent. Oil and natural \ngas reserves are 1.8 trillion cubic meters. Along with oil and gas reserves, Azerbaijan has 200 \nmillion tons of natural bitumen reserves, 350 million tons of shale oil reserves, and 25 million \ntons of projected reserves of lignite. Oil production dominates in the country\u2019s economy; about \n50 million tons of oil is produced annually.  \n \n2.  By  early  2007,  Azerbaijan  was  importing  about  5  billion  cubic  meters  of  natural  gas \nannually from the Russian Federation. This gas was used exclusively for electricity generation \nto reduce inefficient heavy oil consumption. Currently, domestic gas production is increasing \nbecause of incrementing gas production by the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic and \nthe development of Shah Deniz field (whose reserves are estimated at over 1 trillion cubic \nmeters). The weight of natural gas consumption in electricity generation is therefore increasing. \nThe  country  also  improves  gas  supply  and  district  heating.  In  addition,  Azerbaijan  has \nsubstantial potential in the development of alternative and renewable energy sources mainly, \nfrom small hydropower and wind power.   \n \nB.  Power Generation and Supply \n \n3.  Power  Generation.  Thermal  power  generation  accounted  for  89%  of  total  electricity \ngeneration in 2007 (78.9% from natural gas and 21.1% from heavy oil), while hydropower \ngeneration  accounted  for  11%.  The  overall  installed  capacity  of  all  generation  plants  in \nAzerbaijan as of 1 March 2008 was 5,508 megawatts (MW).  Azerenergy owns six thermal \npower plants (TPPs) (3,956 MW), four hydropower plants (HPPs) (1,018 MW), and five modular \npower plants (452 MW). Other power plants are owned by various state-owned and private \nenterprises, including Ganja Clay Factory of Azeraluminum (75 MW), Gas Turbine Power Plant \nat Oil Rocks of the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic (48 MW), TPPs at EP-300 \nEnterprise of Azerkimya (33 MW), and small hydropower plants (HPPs) (19.2 MW).

Power  Supply  and  Balance.  The  electricity  production  of  Azerbaijan  in  2007  was \n21,415 gigawatt-hours (GWh), of which 19,053 GWh (89% of total) was generated from thermal \npower and 2,363 GWh (11% of total) from hydropower. In 2007, about 360 GWh of electricity \nenergy was imported from abroad. The imported energy was primarily from Iran to supply \nNakhchivan Autonomous Republic, which does not have direct access to the national power \nnetwork, and also from the Russian Federation, with which Azerbaijan maintains an annual \nbalance  of  import  and  export.  The  total  export  electricity  energy  to  Iran  and  the  Russian \nFederation was 727 GWh. Total domestic electricity consumption in 2007 was 19,000 GWh. \nThe growth rate of domestic electricity demand reached 5.8% in 2007 and 4.4% in 2006. \nHowever, countrywide electricity consumption decreased by 13% in 2007 compared to 2006 \nbecause of extensive installation of accurate meters and a tariff increase. It is forecast that \nelectricity demand will grow by an average of about 4.7% per year through 2015.

Azerbaijan \nused to import electricity from Turkey via 154 kV transmission lines to meet the power demand \nof Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. However, since 2007, power is exported from Nakhchivan \nAutonomous Republic to Turkey to pay back debts for imported electricity\u2014this was made \npossible by the construction of new generation capacities in Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. \n \n7.  The majority of the power network has been in operation for 30 years or more. As a result, \nthermal carrying capacity has decreased and transmission losses have increased. \n \nC.     Government Policies and Strategies for the Power Sector \n \n8.  Sector Reforms and Policies. With support from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nand other development partners, a comprehensive energy sector (including power, renewable \nenergy, gas, and heat supply) road map1 was prepared in 2006. The Government\u2019s main \nobjectives for development of the power sector are to utilize energy resources efficiently, protect \nthe  country\u2019s  energy  security,  and  ensure  the  delivery  of  reliable  and  adequate  electricity \nservices for sustained economic growth. Since 2005, the Government has been implementing \nreforms in the utilities and infrastructure sectors, through financial restructuring of the large \n                                                 \n1  Valiyev, Vilayat. 2006. Preparation of Energy Sector Roadmap. Manila: ADB . \n   ", "26  Appendix 2 \nnatural monopolies, separation of commercial and regulatory functions, and introduction of a \nproper regulatory framework. The Government\u2019s overall policy framework for development of \nthe  power  sector  has  the  following  components:  (i)  sector  restructuring  to  separate  the \nownership and management of generation, transmission, and distribution; (ii) development of a \nregulatory framework and institutions to promote competition and ensure the financial viability of \nsector enterprises; (iii) introduction of targeted social protection programs to mitigate the impact \nof higher tariffs on vulnerable groups; (iv) involvement of the private sector in the operation and \nfinancing of generation and distribution facilities; and (v) promotion of the use of renewable \nenergy sources and energy efficiency. Progress on sector restructuring has been achieved, \nincluding the establishment of four regional distribution companies; private sector operations in \nthe  power  generation;  and  the  creation  of  the  Ministry  of  Economic  Development  who  is \nresponsible for energy sector policy making, pricing and tariffs, licensing, and management of \nfixed assets. The Tariff Council, chaired by the Ministry of Economic Development, has the \nauthority to propose tariff adjustments, define customer categories, and adopt cost-reflective \ntariff  design.  Furthermore,  the  Government  ordered  all  large  companies  to  change  to \ninternational  financial  reporting  standards  (IFRS)  by  January  2008,  and  all  government \nministries have to implement international public reporting standards by January 2009. This is \nunder the management and control of the Ministry of Finance.  \n \n9.  Development Strategies. The Government\u2019s power sector development strategies are \ndefined by the state program for the development of fuel and energy complex of Azerbaijan \n(2005\u20132015),2 which was approved by presidential decree on 14 February 2005. The outlines of \nthe strategies include \n(i)  construction of new combined cycle gas turbine generation units and hydropower \ngeneration capacities; \n(ii)  modernization  and  reconstruction  of  operating  power  units\u2014increasing  their \nefficiency, prolonging their useful life, and expanding available capacities; \n(iii)  development of small hydropower and other renewable energy sources (wind \nand solar) to supplement the energy balance; \n(iv)  construction of new substations and transmission lines to expand transmission \nand distribution networks, and reconstruction and upgrade of dispatch control \nsystems; \n(v)  strengthening of cross-border links with the Russian and Iranian grids to increase \npower trade capacity; \n(vi)  increasing  investments  for  energy  sector  development  and  attracting  foreign \ninvestments; \n(vii)  expanding  international  collaboration  and  participating  in  the  formation  of \nregional energy markets; and \n(viii)  promotion of private sector participation in infrastructure development. \n \n10.  Existing Legislative Framework. The following normative legislative acts of Azerbaijan, \nrelating to the power sector, are currently in force:  \n \n                                                 \n2  Cabinet of Ministers. 2005. State Program for Development of Fuel and Energy Sector in Azerbaijan (2005\u20132015), \nBaku. \n \n ", "Appendix 2  27\n(i)  Law on Energy (1998). This covers policy objectives, ownership of resources, \ncontrol of exploration, development of fields, and construction and maintenance \nof energy systems. It includes a strong commitment to energy efficiency and \ncontains significant licensing provisions.   \n \n(ii)  Law on Power Engineering (1998). This provides the legal basis for power \ngeneration,  transmission,  distribution,  purchase,  sales,  and  consumption.  It \ngoverns  the  activities  of  state  power  engineering  companies,  power  supply \ncompanies, independent power producers, and consumers. The relevant state \nauthorities are responsible for licensing, transmission and distribution contracts, \npricing, de-monopolization, performance criteria, rules, and standards.    \n \n(iii)  Law on Electric and Thermal Electric Plants (1999). This creates convenient \nconditions for the production of electricity and heat in power plants, including \ndevelopment  of  independent  power  producers;  construction  and  operation  of \npower plants with sovereign guarantee; and implementation of environmental \nmonitoring and management for power plants. \n \n(iv)  Law on Use of Energy Resources (1999). This provides the legal, economic, \nsocial, and environmental grounds for utilization of energy resources. \n \n(v)  Law  on  Natural  Monopolies (1998). This defines the institutional and legal \nbasis of state regulation of natural monopolies, and ensures the conformity of the \nactivities of natural monopoly with consumers\u2019 interests. \n \n(vi)  Law on Privatization of State Property (2000). According to the law, the major \nobjective  of  privatization  of  state  property  is  to  achieve  improvement  in  the \nefficiency of the economy, structural adjustments, and living standards of the \npopulation  through  liberalization  of  the  economy,  strengthening  of \nentrepreneurship,  formation  of  a  competition  climate,  and  attraction  of \ninvestments. \n \n11.  Institutional Structure. The cabinet of ministers mainly provides the normative and \nlegislative basis for the sector, while the Ministry of Industry and Energy carries out state policy \nin the energy sector (development and application of strategies, investment plans, development \nprograms, normative and legal documents, etc.) and conducts regulatory (issuance of licenses, \ndevelopment and application of standards, preparation of various codes, etc.) and supervisory \nfunctions  (technical  audits,  monitoring,  reporting,  information  requests,  etc.)  for  sector \nenterprises. As regulatory bodies, the Ministry of Economic Development and the Ministry of \nFinance implement the regulatory functions, such as formation of the economic and financial \npolicy in the sector; and overseeing investment plans, tariff issues, subsidies, and financial and \nsocial assistance. The Tariff (Price) Council addresses monopoly services for the electricity, \nnatural gas, and water sectors. It has authority to propose tariff adjustments to the cabinet of \nministers, define customer categories, and adopt a cost-reflective tariff design. The committee \nfor management of state property has the supervisory function over the concession agreements \nfor electric distribution networks and approves their investment programs. It also supervises \nrelations with consumers, and oversees any privatization and management of property in the \nenergy sector.  \n \n12.  Azerenergy Open Joint-Stock Company (JSC) is the state-owned power company that \ngenerates  electricity,  transmits  the  generated  electricity,  and  delivers  part  of  it  directly  to \n   ", "28  Appendix 2 \nconsumers and sells it in bulk to power distribution companies. Distribution companies deliver \nelectricity  to  retail  consumers  within  their  service  areas.  Small  private  hydropower  plants \n(independent power producers) generate electricity and deliver it directly to power system or \nconsumers.  \n \n13.  Private Sector Participation. Under the laws governing the power sector, the sector\u2019s \ninstitutional structure comprises interrelations among Azerenergy, power supply enterprises, \nindependent power producers, and power consumers. Azerenergy is dominant in the generation \nand  transmission  of  electricity,  as  well  as  about  50%  of  electric  distribution  networks. \nIndependent power producers have emerged as a result of the privatization of three small \nhydropower plants. They operate within the structure of other enterprises and sell the generated \npower  independently.  In  September  2007,  the  Ministry  of  Economic  Development  and  the \nKorean Power Company signed a preliminary agreement on the construction of the first private \nthermal power plant (700 MW).   \n \n14.  Price\u2013Tariff Policy. The price and tariff regulation is conducted by the reorganized Tariff \nCouncil. In compliance with existing legislation, decisions on the regulation of prices (tariffs), \nservice fees, and collections are adopted by a simple majority of vote principle. The regulations \nalso provide the principles and methodology for state regulation.  \n \n15.  Current wholesale and retail electricity tariffs were approved by the Tariff Council on \n6 January 2007. The wholesale tariff is AZN0.041 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) inclusive of value-\nadded tax (VAT) for Azerenergy Open JSC, AZN0.025 per kWh for small private hydropower \nplants, and AZN0.045 per kWh (VAT-inclusive) for wind power plants. Retail tariffs for all \nconsumer categories (residential, commercial, and others) is AZN0.06 per kWh (VAT-inclusive). \nThe transmission tariff is AZN0.002 per kWh (VAT-inclusive). Prices for export and import \ntransactions are regulated under the terms of relevant agreements. Electricity import\u2013export \narrangements are conducted with the neighboring Georgia, Iran, and Russian Federation. The \nmajority of import\u2013export arrangements with the Russian Federation are on a monetary basis \n(prices are subject to negotiations between two countries). There is a severe difference in \nexport and import transactions because Azerbaijan imports Russian electricity mainly for peak \ndemand periods at higher tariffs, and exports electricity to the Russian Federation at lower \ntariffs during nighttime. The electricity swap with Iran is conducted on a seasonal basis\u2014this is \nefficient because Azerbaijan imports electricity from Iran in the winter (when Azerbaijan has \npeak electricity demand) and exports to Iran in the spring and summer (when Iran has peak \nelectricity demand). \n \nD.  Existing Problems and Challenges in the Power Sector  \n \n17.  The power sector has suffered from inadequate funding to invest in new power facilities, \nperform essential maintenance functions, and introduce new technology. The most challenging \ntechnical problems of the power sector are (i) deterioration of 20% of the power equipment and \nmore than 50% of the grid facilities; (ii) a shortfall of peak load in the system (about 300 MW); \nand (iii) lack of adequate capacity of transmission lines. The high-voltage transmission lines, \nincluding  those  connecting  Mingechevir  and  Absheron,  are  obsolete  with  high  losses  and \nfrequent outages. Some of these transmission lines have completed their useful life. The result \nhas  been  a  distinct  deterioration  in  the  quality  of  the  infrastructure  and  an  associated \ndeterioration  in  the  quality  of  services.  Rehabilitating  and  upgrading  generation  and \ntransmission facilities could significantly improve the reliability and quality of power system \noperation, and reduce system losses. The proposed Power Transmission Enhancement Project \nwill substantially contribute to the Government\u2019s efforts in that respect. \n \n ", "Appendix 3  29\nPROBLEM TREE ANALYSIS FOR THE POWER

Background  \n1.  The proposed Project, to be funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), is set in the \ncontext of the state program for development of fuel and energy sector in Azerbaijan (2005\u2013\n2015).1 The  state  program  recognizes  the  changing  structure  of  energy  demand,  with  the \nsignificant  increase  in  the  residential  component,  and  the  consequential  impact  on  peak \ndemand in the winter caused by the heating load. \n \n2.  Although Azerenergy identifies benefits to the replacement transmission lines, within the \ncontext of the state program for energy transmission, neither Azerenergy nor the Government \nhave undertaken any cost\u2013benefit analysis to support these benefits other than in the following \nreferences. It was however concluded by Azerenergy and confirmed by ADB that the Project will \nincrease the supply of the power network by 300 megawatts (MW), reduce the capacity loss by \n8 MW, and cut the loss of electric energy by 25 gigawatt-hours (GWh).  \n \n3.  Azerenergy also identifies the shortfall in peak capacity (some 300 MW), which requires \nthat peak demand is met by importing energy from the Russian Federation. It is on this basis \nthat  the  justification  of  the  replacement  transmission  lines  is  proposed,  by  evaluating  the \navoidable cost of imported peak power. \n \n4.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) compares the annual streams of economic \ncapital and operating costs against benefits based on willingness to pay. All costs, benefits, and \nrevenues are expressed in 2007 constant prices. The analysis period includes the construction \nperiod and 23 years (up to 2030) of operation. Details of the assumptions and calculations used \nfor the economic analysis are in Supplementary Appendix C. The economic analysis confirms \nthat the Project will alleviate high energy costs for the country, and help meet energy security \nand projected growth in demand for electric power. Cost\u2013benefit projections were prepared and \nanalyzed, and they indicated that the Project is economically viable. \n \nB.  Project Alternatives \n5.  If connections between existing centers of demand and generation need to be sustained, \nthere are no viable alternatives to replacing existing transmission lines. There may be options \nregarding routing, connections to the lines, and the location of substations, and these should be \nsubject to evaluation by system planning techniques.    \n \n6.  When replacing existing transmission lines, consideration of the least-cost option will be \na matter of evaluating the technical specifications. \n \n7.  Azerenergy  has  addressed  the  issue  of  the  project  alternative  from  a  different \nperspective. Its prefeasibility study report projects that the new transmission lines will result in \nthe availability of an additional 300 MW of capacity (which represents the design capacity of a \ngeneric thermal power plant).    \n \n8.  The cost of the proposed transmission lines (capital cost of $176 million) has been \ncompared with the construction cost of a generic power plant ($460 million). In addition, the \n                                                 \n1  Cabinet of Ministers. 2005, State Program for Development of Fuel and Energy Sector in Azerbaijan (2005\u20132015). \nBaku. ", "40  Appendix 9 \nlifetime operational cost of the transmission lines is calculated to be some $16 million a year \ncheaper.  While  the  comparison  may  serve  to  emphasize  the  merit  of  the  replacement \ntransmission  lines,  the  alternative  of  constructing  a  new  generating  plant  has  not  been \nproposed.   \n \nC.  Economic Analysis Calculations \n1.  Cost\u2013Benefit Analysis \n9.  The EIRR calculation was based on incremental cost and benefit streams associated to \nthe  Project.  Economic  performance  was  evaluated  by  comparing  with-  and  without-project \nscenarios. Incremental consumption occurs because of the extended availability of lower-cost \nelectricity. Economic benefits accrue to consumers and the economy as a result of the Project.  \n \n  2.  Project Benefits \n \n10.  Reduced Imports. The methodology applied for evaluating the single quantified benefit \nof the Project was the avoidable cost of importing peak energy from the Russian Federation. \nThe value of 650 GWh for the saved import energy is based on actual data. \n \n11.  The basis for valuing the replacement transmission line is that it will permit the direct \nsubstitution of imported electricity with own generation. The economic benefit is therefore non-\nincremental, and relates to a traded product. The basis of valuation will be the tariffs relating to \nthe import and export of electricity. Azerenergy indicates that, in terms of trading energy with the \nRussian Federation, it is only able to export at the low-rate night tariff of 2.3 cents per kWh \n(c/kWh) (which does not cover generation cost). \n \n12.  The economic price should therefore be based on the weighted average of the import \nand export prices, and it is assumed that these contractual prices have no element of transport, \ndistribution,  or  handling.  This  approach  follows  ADB\u2019s  guidance  on  import  substitute  and \nexportable output.2 The base case has assumed the weighting of imports to exports at 50:50, \nbased on the assumption of 650 GWh\u2014this is considered conservative given that, aside from \n2007, imports have exceeded exports by more than two times.3 This gives a weighted average \nprice for import to export exchange of 4.25 c/kWh. A detailed explanation can be found in \nSupplementary Appendix C. \n \n13.  Transmission  System  Losses.  The  evaluation  of  reduced  system  losses  is \nincorporated into the calculation of the total 650 GWh energy increase. There is an implied \nassumption of 4% system losses, which appears reasonable. Table A9.1 shows the recent \nlevels of transmission losses. \n \nTable A9.1: Transmission System Losses  \n(%) \n2005  2006 2007 3-Year Average \n4.65  4.63 4.40 4.56 \n            Source: Azerenergy Open Joint-Stock Company. \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila (Appendix 10).  \n3  Azerenergy regards 2007 an exceptional year because of reduced consumer demand resulting from the 2007 retail \ntariff increase of 170% in combination with the increased installation of electricity meters. Import and exports were \nestimated at about 250 GWh for a total of 500 GWh for 2007. \n \n \n ", "Appendix 9  41\n14.  A reduction of 12.5% in transmission losses (the midpoint in the anticipated 10%\u201315% \nrange of improvement) will reduce the absolute level to 4% (para.13). \n \n15.  Improved System Performance. Based on 2006\u20132007 fault statistics, it is estimated \nthat total annual outages amounted to 33 hours for Mingechevir 1 transmission line and 33.5 \nhours for Mingechevir 2 transmission line. \n \n16.  To derive a value for power lost from an annual average outage of 33 hours, reference \nwas made to the World Bank report on the Azerbaijan Power Transmission Project.4 The report \nshows losses for Mingechevir 1 and 2 transmission lines in 2003 totaling 224.5 hours with \nlosses  of  13,605  megawatt-hours  (MWh);  by  interpolation,  the  average  annual  2006\u20132007 \nlosses equate to 2,000 MWh.  \n \n17.  The World Bank report also identifies willingness to pay on the basis of a weighted \naverage cost of diesel and kerosene of 21.5 c/kWh. Adjusting this value from 2005 to 2007 \nprices by taking the movement in the AZN/$ exchange rate gives a value of 24.3 c/kWh for \nwillingness to pay. If it is assumed that the new line will reduce outages by 50%, the annual \neconomic benefit is 1,000 MWh valued at willingness to pay, giving a total of $243,000 per \nannum. \n \n18.  Reduced Maintenance Costs. An annual reduction in maintenance costs of $100,000 \nhas been identified by Azerenergy for inclusion in the economic analysis. \n \n19.  Deferred  Expenditure  on  New  Generation.  Azerenergy  identifies  the  cost  of \nconstructing a 300 MW power station at $460 million as an alternative option to the replacement \ntransmission lines. Investment in the new lines will defer any decision to increase capacity in \ngeneration, and the related benefit will be the capital costs savings of such a deferral\u2014as \nmeasured by the potential interest earned on the deferred debt service costs. This benefit has \nbeen  quantified  at  $3.0 million  per  annum,  assuming  a  10%  deposit  rate,  and  has  been \nassumed for the first 2 years of the Project. \n \n20.  Salvage Value from Removal of Existing Lines. The removal of the existing lines will \ngive  rise  to  two  streams  of  benefits:  (i)  scrap  value  of  metal  content  of  equipment,  and \n(ii) opportunity benefit of reusing transmission towers at lower voltages. \n \n21.  Azerenergy does not have readily available data to quantify the potential volume of \nscrap metal. \n \n22.  The number of transmission towers to be reused is estimated at 600. The cost estimates \nfor the new replacement lines include 980 new towers, so a recycling rate of 60% seems \nreasonable. The cost of a new 220 kilovolt (kV) steel tower from the estimates is $64,400; it is \nassumed that the replacement cost of a smaller 110 kV tower is 50% of this value. \n \n23.  The benefit of reusing 600 towers at lower voltage levels is therefore $19.3 million. \nHowever, to reflect the potential uncertainties in these figures, a lower value of $10.0 million has \nbeen taken as a one-off benefit in year 5. \n \n                                                 \n4  World Bank. 2005.

Washington DC (31485-AZE). \n   ", "42  Appendix 9 \nD.  Project Costs \n11.  Construction Costs. The economic price of the construction costs will be the financial \ncosts less any transfer payments. Therefore, customs duties, value-added tax, and payroll \ndeductions have been removed. With regard to payroll deductions, assumptions have been \nmade regarding the labor component of project costs.  \n \n25.  Land Costs. The replacement transmission lines will follow the route of the existing twin \nlines, so the existing land usage will continue. This can be considered a sunk cost, with no \neconomic cost consequences for the Project. However, in principle, half of the land under the \nexisting transmission line will become \u201csurplus\u201d and can be considered to have a potential \nopportunity cost for the Project. Because Azerenergy owns the land, it has been suggested that \nany surplus could be utilized as compensation to the local population for the disruption of \nbuilding the new lines. Therefore, the release of land would transfer an economic benefit, \ndependent on the use made of the land. No evaluation has been made of this benefit. \n \n26.  Operating Costs. The only incremental operating cost is the 30 staff required to operate \nthe new substation; transfer payments relating to payroll deductions have been eliminated. It is \nunderstood  that  the  intention  would  be  to  initially  operate  the  substation  with  existing \nAzerenergy staff, but that over time local staff would be trained to operate the facility. \n  \nE.  Results \n27.  The economic cost\u2013benefit analysis results in an EIRR of 14.8% for the Project. The net \nbenefits of the Project were estimated to be $26.14 million. The sensitivity analyses show that \nthe investment program remains justified even if various risks materialize.  \n \n28.  The economic classification of the benefits and costs is summarized in Table A9.2: \n \nTable A9.2: Structure of Transmission Project Benefits and Costs \n($ million) \nItem  Present Value \nCapital Costs  (142.34) \nOperating Costs   \nLabor  0.29 \nProject Benefits   \nReduced energy imports  154.67 \nReduced maintenance costs  0.56 \nReduced system outages  1.36 \nReuse of transmission towers  7.12 \nDeferral of generation expenditure  5.07 \nTotal  26.14 \n  Source: ADB estimates. \n \n29.

The most sensitive variables are the volume, pricing, and ratio of energy imports and \nexports, as well as variation in capital costs. If only the single benefit of the reduced imports is \nincluded, the EIRR will reduce to 13.2%. \n \n34.  A  reduction  in  the  net  present  value  (NPV)  to  zero  would  require  the  following \ncircumstances: \n(i)  a 19.2% increase in capital costs; \n(ii)  the ratio of imports/exports to move from 50:50 to 31:69; and \n(iii)  the lowest export tariff to decrease from 2.3 c/kWh to 0.861 c/kWh. \n \n35.  The latter two conditions would reflect Azerenergy becoming a net exporter of electricity \nand continuing to sell the increased volumes of exports at the nighttime tariff of 2.3 c/kWh or \nlower. This is not a sustainable situation since the tariff would not cover generation costs, so it is \nanticipated that any sustainable increased level of exports would be at a higher price. The \nProject therefore delivers a robust and sustainable economic return at 14.8%, around which \nindividual sensitivities do not indicate any significant stress. One element that has not been \ncaptured in this analysis is the future potential for transfer of energy from east to west, and the \nstrategic opportunities that could be developed in the context of a regional power exchange. \nSince there is still no framework or data on which to evaluate this scenario, it remains an \nunquantified but potential benefit. \n \n \n \n ", "Appendix 10  45\nSUMMARY OF FINANCIAL ANALYSIS \nA.  Introduction \n1.  The  financial  analysis  of  the  Project  has  been  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the \nFinancial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects1of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB). \nAll  financial  costs  and  benefits  have  been  expressed  at  constant  2007  price  levels.  \nCost streams used for the purposes of financial internal rate of return (FIRR) determination \n(i.e., capital investment, and operations and maintenance) reflect the costs of delivering the \nestimated benefits. The tariff for electricity has been assumed as the difference between the \ncosts of imported electricity and the cost of own generation of electricity, and has been set at \n$0.036362 per kilowatt-hour (kWh). The tariff is applied to the volume of 650 GWh\u2014assuming \nthat the Project will enable domestic generation to replace imports. \n \nB.  Methodology and Major Assumptions \n2.  The financial viability of the Project has been assessed assuming a 3-year construction \nperiod from 2009 to 2011. It is assumed that construction will finish in the first half of 2011 and \nthe new line will start to operate in the second half of 2011. The weighted average cost of \ncapital (WACC) is also calculated for the Project and was compared with the FIRR to ascertain \nthe  financial  viability  of  the  investment  program.  Price  contingencies  and  interest  during \nconstruction were excluded from the capital costs for the purpose of the FIRR, which is at 2009 \nconstant prices. The net present value (NPV) of the projected incremental net cash flows arising \nfrom the Project was calculated using the WACC as the discount rate, and was used to predict \nwhether the Project will generate sufficient funds to cover all project-related costs, including loan \ninterest and principal repayment. \n \n3.  Financial viability was examined by comparing the incremental costs and benefits of \nwith- and without-investment scenarios. The main incremental benefit assumed was due to the \ndecreased import of electricity, estimated at 650 gigawatt-hours (GWh), and consistent over the \nperiod of review from 2011 to 2030 (half year benefit in 2011). No incremental additional \nmaintenance  costs  were  considered  compared  to  the  existing  transmission  lines.  After \nconsultation with Azerenergy, an assumption of an annual incremental benefit of $100,000 in \nmaintenance savings was added. As the useful life of the new transmission lines is expected to \nbe 40 years, the residual value of the transmission lines has not been included in the analysis. \n \n4.  Tariffs  are  governed  by  regulations  specific  to  the  electricity  industry  and  national \nmonopolies. Historically, such tariffs have been based on a \u201ccost-plus\u201d system, meaning cost of \nservice  plus  a  margin,  where  costs  are  determined  under  the  rules  and  regulations  on \naccounting and reporting of Azerbaijan. In practice, tariff decisions are significantly affected by \nsocial and political considerations. Current levels allow Azerenergy to pass though the full cost \nrecovery of the loan, depreciation, return on equity, operation and maintenance expenses, and \nworking capital expenses. \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n2  The generation element of tariffs has been announced to be 4.2 c/kWh. The cost of $0.03636 is derived from \nactual costs generated divided by actual generation for the year. As tariffs include a 10% markup, the cost \nassumption is consistent with actual generation tariffs charged. ", "46  Appendix 10 \nC.  Weighted Average Cost of Capital and Financial Internal Rate of Return \n5.  To  compute  the  WACC,  it  is  assumed  that  the  financing  sources  would  consist  of \nAzerenergy\u2019s equity contribution financed through retained earnings. The cost of Azerenergy\u2019s \nequity is assumed at the domestic long-term savings rate of 10%. The other assumptions are a \ndomestic inflation rate of 5%. As shown in Table A10.1, the WACC for the investment program \nduring the Project is 2.45%. \n \nTable A10.1: Weighted Average Cost of Capital \n(%) \n \n  Financing Component \nItem  ADB loan  Azerenergy  Total \nAmount of project ($\u2019000)  160,000.00  79,745.00  239,745.00 \nWeighting  67.00  33.00  100.00 \nNominal cost (for calculation)  3.01  10.00  \u2014 \nTax rate  22.00  22.00  \u2014 \nTax-adjusted nominal cost  2.30  7.80  \u2014 \nInflation rate  \u2014  5.00  \u2014 \nReal cost  2.35  2.67  \u2014 \nMinimum rate test (4%)  4.00  4.00   \nWeighted component of WACC  2.70  1.30  4.00 \nWACC in real cost  1.57  0.89  2.45 \n\u2014 = not applicable, WACC = weighted average cost of capital. \nSource: Asian Development Bank and Azerenergy estimates. \n \n6.  The FIRR is calculated at 11.89% for the Project. This rate compares favorably with the \nestimated WACC value of 2.45% or the minimum test rate of 4% set by ADB, substantiating the \nfinancial viability of the Project. In performing a sensitivity and risk analysis of the projected \nvariables used in the base case, the consultants used the following scenarios:   \n(i)  10-year stream of expected benefit instead of 20 years, \n(ii)  increase the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) up to 10%, \n(iii)  increase in capital expenditure (CAPEX) of 10%, \n(iv)  decrease in benefits of 10%, \n(v)  decrease in benefits up to get NPV to zero, and \n(vi)  increase in CAPEX to get NPV to zero. \n \n7.  Each of the alternative scenarios was assessed in terms of the projected incremental \ndiscounted cash flows arising out of the capital project. Using the WACC rate established for the \nbase case, the NPV and FIRR were calculated. \n \n8.  The net cash flow was calculated using the general approach of the presentation of a \ncash  flow  statement,  i.e.,  loan  principal  receipts,  loan  repayments,  loan  interest,  and \ncommitment fees have been included in the calculation. However, for the calculation of the NPV \nand FIRR, the free cash flow has been used. Free cash flow excludes all debt service receipts, \nrepayments, interest, and commitment fees. \n \n \n ", "Appendix 10  47\n9.  The  cost  estimates  include  an  8%  physical  contingency  against  equipment  and \nmaterials, and civil works.

In  all  scenarios,  except  when  the  benefit  stream  is  10  years  instead  of  \n20 years (Table A10.3), the FIRR is greater than the WACC and the NPV is positive. In the most \nnegative scenario (10-year benefit stream), the NPV is negative and the FIRR (3.32%) is less \nthan the WACC test rate of 4% but above the actual projected WACC of 2.45%. The new \ntransmission lines are expected to have a useful life of 40 years, so the benefit stream will most \nprobably be more than 10 years. Therefore, aside from the most negative scenario of an \nexpected benefit stream of 10 years instead of 20 years, the Project is financially viable and \nAzerenergy will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to cover the projected costs (including \nloan interest and principal repayment requirements).  \n \n12.  The sensitivity analysis includes two more scenarios to investigate at what level (i) the \nexpected benefits should be decreased, or (ii) the CAPEX should be increased\u2014to get the NPV \nto zero. The calculations show that the NPV will be zero if (i) the benefits reduce by 54%, or \n(ii) the CAPEX increases more than two times. \n              \n \n ", "Appendix 11  49\nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND PROJECTIONS OF AZERENERGY \n1.  The summary financial statements of Azerenergy are in Tables A11.1\u2013A11.5. Figures for \n2006\u20132007 (local statements) and the audited international financial reporting standards (IFRS) \nfinancial statements for 2005 (with comparative data for 2004) prepared by Price Waterhouse \nCoopers  were  reviewed.  Figures  for  2008\u20132030  are  projections,  based  on  notes  and \nassumptions described below. Detailed financial projections are in Supplementary Appendix D.  \n \nA.  Past Financial Performance \n2.  Azerenergy  experienced  growth  in  total  revenue  in  2007\u2014AZN934  million \n($1.146 billion), a 222% increase over 2006\u2014despite the fact that energy demand did not \nincrease correspondingly. The main reason for this growth was the increase in tariffs. The \ncompany\u2019s operating results also improved during 2007 because of the overall increase in \ntariffs. The cost of sales amounted to AZN695 million ($853 million) in 2007, or 74% of total \nrevenue, a significant improvement over 2006 where it was 185% of total turnover. The cost of \nfuel continued to be the largest component of the cost of sales\u2014in 2005, it accounted for 73% \nof the total (74% in 2004). The cost of imported energy was AZN27 million ($32 million) in 2007, \nfalling from AZN38 million ($46 million) in 2006. The ratio of total equity and liabilities improved \nslightly from 22% in 2006 to 26% in 2007. The total liabilities to equity ratio also improved from \n3.45 in 2006 to 2.84 in 2007. The improvement in Azerenergy\u2019s gearing ratio shows that the \ncompany  is  able  to  earn  enough capital  using  long-term  borrowings  for  investment  in  the \nindustry. In spite of a significant improvement in the debt service coverage ratio (up to 0.50 \ntimes in 2007 from 0.05 times in 2006), this performance indicator is still low. However, from \n2007, the Government has been making efforts to increase tariffs to cover costs plus a 10% \nreturn. In 2007, tariffs were increased to a point where government subsidies were no longer \nneeded. Detailed financial analysis is in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \nB.  Projections \n  1.  Inflation and Exchange Rate \n3.  An average annual inflation rate of 5% is projected during the entire forecast period. This \nis similar to the parameters used for financial analysis of the proposed Project. All data was \nprepared in Azerbaijan manats (AZN), so the amounts of capital expenditures forecast in other \ncurrencies have been exchanged to AZN at the rate of AZN0.85 = $1.00. To simplify the \ncalculations, the same exchange rate was used for the whole forecast period, so exchange rate \ngain or loss was ignored. \n \n  2.  Income Statement \n4.  Sales. Azerenergy provided the energy balance and demand forecast, based on actual \ndata for 2007. Although actual electricity production and demand decreased in 2007 compared \nto 2006, Azerenergy management assures that this is a temporary decrease caused by the \nsignificant tariff increase and the introduction of a metering program in 2007. Therefore, it is \nassumed that gross electricity production will increase by 5% per year up to 2021, then by 3% \nper year up to 2025, and 2% thereafter. Imports of electricity will continue at 650 gigawatt-hours \n(GWh) per year until the transmission line is operational from the middle of 2010 (it is assumed \nthat 300 GWh will be imported in 2011). \n \n5.  Tariffs. In principle, tariffs increase with gross electricity production (5% per year up to \n2021, 3% up to 2025, 2% thereafter) but they are also adjusted to meet the covenants of at \nleast 1.5 times debt service coverage ratio (free cash flow over debt service for the year) and a \n   ", "50  Appendix 11 \ndebt to liabilities and equity ratio of 70%. Therefore, there is a one-off increase of 30% in 2012. \nTariff levels are shown in Table A11.1. \n \nTable A11.1: Tariff Levels \n \n  Actual    Projected \nIndicator  2006  2007    2008  2009  2010  2011  2012  2013  2014  2015 \nAZN/kWh  0.017  0.048  0.051  0.053  0.056  0.059  0.076  0.080  0.084  0.088 \nIncrease (%)    170  5  5  5  5  30  5  5  5 \nDSCR (times)            1.530  1.960  1.830  2.420 \nNote: Principle repayment starts in 2012 from where DSCR calculation starts. \nDSCR = debt service coverage ratio. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \n6.  Operating Expenses and Taxation. The cost of fuel, staff, and other operating costs \nare  projected  on  the  basis  of  actual  2007  data,  adjusted  on  annual  growth  of  electricity \nproduction which is assumed at an average growth of 3% per year from 2008 to 2020, 4% \nduring 2021, and 5% from 2025 onward. Average growth in expenses is less than the total \naverage inflation rate (5%) in the early years because of the effect of implementation of various \ncost control measures including the introduction of a financial management information system \nwithin a separate institutional strengthening program. Taxes are assumed to be the same as for \n2007 (profit tax 22%, VAT 18%). \n \n3.  Balance Sheet and Cash Flow \n7.  Fixed Assets Capital Expenditures and Debt. Capital expenditures include proposed \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) project expenditures during 2009\u20132011; and other current and \nfuture projects financed by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), \nWorld Bank, Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau \n(KfW), and others. It is assumed that Azerenergy will increase its own contribution to financing \ncapital expenditures starting from 2016. Total capital expenditures will gradually decrease from \nAZN658 million in 2009 to AZN200 million in 2013. A significant increase in capital expenditures \nis assumed from AZN350 million in 2015 to AZN1.70  billion in 2030 due to the expanding \nnetwork and growing economy. It is expected that with the willingness of increasing tariffs to \ncover all costs, Azerenergy will generate enough cash for capital investments after 2016 and will \nfinance the majority of capital expenditures itself. It was assumed that a significant part of \ncapital expenditures after 2020 will be spent on replacement of old and out-of-date plants and \nequipment. \n \n \n ", "Appendix 11  51\nFigure A11:

Review of Current Financial Management Practices \n \n1.  Current financial accounting, planning, and reporting procedures at Azerenergy originate \nin the old Soviet system and have not changed much during the past several years. A general \nreview of existing policies and procedures is presented in the following subsections, followed by \nrecommendations for improvements to financial management and reporting practices. \n  \nB.  Existing Accounting Policies  \n \n2.  Major accounting transactions are recognized and recorded by Azerenergy following the \naccrual basis of accounting (e.g., the accounting of revenue, cost of sales, and the resulting \nreceivables and payables). The adoption of the accrual basis of accounting is very important in \nthe process of bringing local accounting procedures in compliance with international financial \nreporting standards (IFRS). However, some expenses (such as bank charges, interest expense, \ntax  expense,  and  some  other  expenses)  might  be  recognized  by  Azerenergy  only  when \nsupporting documents are received, but not when the expense is incurred as required under the \nIFRS. Other departures from IFRS are noted in the following paragraphs. \n \n3.  Property, plant, and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, except \nfor items that were commissioned before 1996. Items acquired before 1996 are carried at the \nstatutory indexed cost. According to existing accounting rules in Azerbaijan, fixed assets are \nthose that are used for a period of more than 1 year and from which the company derives an \neconomic benefit from their use. Depreciation of property, plant, and equipment is accrued \nmonthly using the reducing balance method, by rates prescribed in tax legislation. \n \n4.  Property, plant, and equipment have been revalued (indexed) twice, in 1993 and 1996, \nto take account of the effects of inflation during these years. The indices used were prescribed \nin guidelines issued by the cabinet of ministers. Inventories are recorded at cost. The cost of \ninventory is determined on the weighted average basis. The cost of finished goods and work in \nprogress comprises raw material, direct labor, and other direct costs.  \n \n5.  A  physical inventory  of  fixed  assets  and  stocks  is  performed  each  year.  A  special \ncommission (including fixed assets and materials accountants) is established to conduct the \nstocktaking and to prepare a report on the results of the inventory. A comparison of the fixed \nassets and stocks physical count and accounting data is presented in the commission\u2019s report. \nThis process is concerned only with the physical verification of the assets, not with their value. \n \n6.  The billing and cash collection system for generation and transmission is centralized and \ncontrolled  by  the  management  of  Azerenergy.  Distribution  entities  are  decentralized,  and \ngenerate their own profit and produce their own income statement.  \n \n7.  Trade and other receivables are accounted on the accrual basis (in accordance with bills \nsent to customers). Revenue and resulting receivables, in accordance with the statutory local \nfinancial  statements,  contain  a  significant  element  of  irrecoverable  debts.  The  creation  of \nprovision for doubtful and bad debts is prohibited in accordance with local tax legislation. \nAzerenergy has the right to write off to bad debts expense those receivables that have not been \ncollected during the past 3 years, but the amount of the write-offs is very limited and must be \nagreed with state authorities such as tax inspectors. The company does not attempt to discount \nthe  long-term  part  of  trade  receivables  that  was  deferred  in  accordance  with  government ", "Appendix 12  57\ndecrees. The company does not separate the long-term part of receivables in the local balance \nsheet, but shows the total amount as current receivables. \n \n8.  Trade and other payables are accrued when the counterparty performed its obligations \nunder the contract and are carried at cost. Accounts payables comprise trade accounts payable, \npayables to employees for salary and wages, tax payable, payable to non-budget social funds, \nand payables to other creditors. The company does not discount the long-term part of trade \npayables and deferred tax payables in accordance with government decrees. The company \ndoes not separate the long-term part of payables in the local balance sheet but shows the total \namount as current payables.    \n \n9.  The authorized capital of Azerenergy has been created on the basis of certificates \nentitling the founder to the assets of the company. The sole founder of the company is the \nGovernment  of  Azerbaijan.  From  time  to  time,  the  authorized  capital  might  be  changed \n(adjusted) in accordance with changes in legislation or reregistration of the company\u2019s legal \nposition. No shares have been issued. \n \n10.  Starting in 2006, profit tax is calculated on the basis of 22% of taxable profit. Prior to \nthat, the profit tax rate was 24%. Profit after taxation is distributed to the accumulation and \nconsumption (social) funds. These funds are usually used for the reimbursement of expenses \nwhich, in accordance with local tax legislation, are not allowed to be included in the income \nstatement  as  expenses.  Examples  include  bonuses,  additional  payments,  material  aids  to \nemployees, provision for cultural and welfare facilities, charity, and other expenses.   \n \n11.  In  summary,  the  local  accounting  and  financial  reporting  procedures  followed  by \nAzerenergy and its subsidiaries in general are in line with the norms and regulations set out in \nlocal tax legislation.  \n \nC.  Internal and External Audit  \n \n12.  Azerenergy  does  not  have  an  internal  audit  department.  However,  company \nmanagement has made the decision to create an internal audit function and preparatory work is \nunder way. It is assumed that the internal audit department will include specialists in energy, \nmarketing, economics, finance, and accounting. The objectives of the new function should be \nthe control over the operating, marketing, and financial management activities of the company; \nand provision of recommendations for their future developments. Nevertheless, the structure \nand job descriptions for the staff of the internal audit department have not yet been developed. \n \n13.  The  financial  statements  of  Azerenergy  have  been  audited  in  accordance  with \ninternational auditing standards since 1998 because of lenders\u2019 requirements (European Bank \nfor  Reconstruction  and  Development,  World  Bank,  Islamic  Development  Bank).  The \ninternational audit of Azerenergy\u2019s 2005 IFRS financial statements were completed in June \n2007. In mid-2007, the company decided to publicly tender the IFRS audit for 2006. As a result \nof the tender, Deloitte & Touche started the audit of the 2006 accounts in October 2007 and the \nwork has not yet finished. \n \nD.  Information Systems  \n \n14.  The level of computerization of accounting functions in the head office of Azerenergy \nand its subsidiaries is varied and ranges from the manual processing of all transactions in some \nsubsidiaries to the implementation of a computerized system (\u201c1C\u201d accounting software). On the \n   ", "58  Appendix 12 \nwhole, automation of accounting and reporting procedures at Azerenergy is \u201cin its infancy\u201d; \nsubstantial investments are required for hardware, software, and computer literacy training \nprograms.  \n \n15.  As a result, any consolidated or segment reporting is difficult. This has contributed to the \nnegative audit opinions the company has received so far. Therefore, implementation of an \nintegrated financial management information system (FMIS) is necessary for Azerenergy. Given \nthe  company\u2019s  size,  top  of  the  range  systems  would  be  required  (mid-range  systems  are \nnormally recommended for companies with up to 200 system users). Assistance is required with \nsystem specification, tendering, and implementation management. The company recognizes the \nneed for introduction of an integrated FMIS but the poor financial situation has not allowed such \ninvestment so far. \n \n16.  Azerenergy already benefits from the following infrastructure: \n(i)  local area network in head office, \n(ii)  computers in head office, \n(iii)  dial-up connection links to most accounting units, and \n(iv)  limited computers in the accounting units. \n \n17.  While  this  infrastructure  is  adequate  to  support  operation  of  a  modern  FMIS,  the \ncompany will continue to experience problems with effective financial management and audit \nrequirements. When requirements for a new FMIS are defined, they should take into account \nthe need for additional infrastructure to support system operation. \n \nE.  Divergence from IFRS \n \n18.  A review of local accounting procedures and statutory financial statements and their \ncomparison with the audited IFRS financial statements for 2005 prepared by Price Waterhouse \nCoopers revealed a number of divergences from IFRS. Several adjustments were required to \nrestate local financial statements in line with the requirements of IFRS.   \n \n19.  The major adjustments include the following: \n(i)  Eliminate all intercompany balances between head office of Azerenergy and its \nsubsidiaries at the consolidation level, and present the net value of accounts \nreceivable and accounts payable in the consolidated balance sheet. \n(ii)  Calculate and reflect in the accounts provisions for bad and doubtful debts for \ntrade and other receivables. \n(iii)  Trade and other accounts receivable and accounts payable should be carried at \namortized cost using the effective interest method. \n(iv)  Recognize the long-term part of accounts receivable and accounts payable, and \npresent in an appropriate manner in the balance sheet. \n(v)  Recognize  the  current  part  of  long-term  borrowings,  and  present  in  an \nappropriate manner in the balance sheet. \n(vi)  Transfer the net book value of low-value items in use from the balance sheet to \nthe income statement as expenses. \n \n20.  Fair valuation of fixed and other assets is always a difficult issue in the transition of \naccounting under local standards and regulations to those required under IFRS. While fixed \nassets in the initial IFRS balance sheet of Azerenergy may be brought in at deemed cost, \nprovided  that  previous  revaluations  were  based  on  approved  indices,  the  adoption  of  a \n \n ", "Appendix 12  59\nrevaluation measurement model under International Accounting Standards 16 requires periodic \nrevaluation of assets in accordance with professionally appraised market or replacement cost \nvalues as well as ongoing verification of the accuracy of such valuations through the application \nof  tests  for  impairment.  Alternatively,  the  adoption  of  the  historical  cost  model  under \nInternational  Accounting  Standards  16  removes  entirely  the  scope  for  revaluation,  which \nappears to contradict the asset measurement policy maintained by Azerenergy to date: \n(i)  Transfer to retained profits appropriations (balance sheet) from profit )income \nstatement) that have been made to the accumulation, consumption, and social \nfunds; and \n \n(ii)  Transfer  current  expenses  recorded  in  the  fund  accounts  to  the  income \nstatement (e.g., staff costs, general and administrative costs, other costs). \n \n21.  Occasionally, minor adjustments are necessary to the local financial statements as a \nresult of human error. It is anticipated that local accountants will themselves correct such \nclerical errors in future in response to possible auditors\u2019 or consultants\u2019 recommendations. \n \n   ", "60  Appendix 13 \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \nCountry/Project Title:   Azerbaijan: Power Transmission Enhancement Project  \n \nLending/Financing  Department/  Central and West Asia Department \nProject \nModality:  Division:  Infrastructure Division \n       \nI.  POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \n1.  The country\u2019s poverty incidence has been reduced from 47% in 2002 to 24% in 2006. This is partly the result of \nconsistently double-digit gross domestic product growth from 2003 to 2007, which averaged 21.8% per year. This growth \nowes much to its expanding oil industry and the rising oil price in the world market. The interim operational strategy, which \nguided Asian Development Bank (ADB) investment in the country since it became a member in 1999, identified development \noutside the oil sector as one area of ADB operations so that other sectors would grow as well. The country strategy and \nprogram (CSP)a considers the country\u2019s development needs as still tremendous. However, the 2005 ADB sector review \nmission identified renewable energy and gas supply in regional towns as investment niches. The CSP nonetheless identified \ndeteriorating physical infrastructure and its need for rehabilitation. The state program on poverty reduction and economic \ndevelopment (2003\u20132005),b which is currently being updated, identified power lines that have to be improved as one action to \nreduce poverty.     \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: GI \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nThe Project intends to increase the efficiency of power transmission from Mingechevir hydropower plant to Baku, the country\u2019s \nindustrial center. It is not a core poverty reduction project but is expected to address the interim operation strategy to develop \nthe non-oil sectors of the economy to attain more balanced and sustainable growth. One constraint of the improvement of the \ncountry\u2019s power sector is the aging facilities, including power lines. The Project will replace the 50-year old Mingechevir\u2013Xirlan \npower line. The greater efficiency in power transmission will contribute to the improvement of power quality and availability in \nBaku. The capital city harbored a quarter of the country\u2019s poor in 2002, and this may have not changed much at present.  \n \nThe contribution of the Project, in providing more reliable and stable supply of electricity, will benefit both industrial and \ndomestic users. It can enhance the employment capacity of industrial users and has multiple poverty impacts on domestic \nusers. It is well established that electricity supply can encourage home businesses to flourish as lights extend available time, \nand access to information and communication improves. The quality of water service, health care, and schools improves; and \nbecomes more available as electricity-driven devices are put to use. The greater and wider availability of public and private \nservices saves time that can be diverted to other activities and further improves production. Wider use of electricity for lighting \nand cooking can spare wood fuels, which reduces forest use and improves indoor air quality. Electricity also has an enabling \neffect on women. It enhances their income generation capacity, physical mobility, ability to organize work based on \nconvenience, knowledge on gender issues, and decision-making power.         \n \n2. Design Features. The Project is designed to avoid land acquisition and resettlement impacts. Land acquisition is avoided \nby using the existing corridor and situating new towers on the same sites as old ones. Resettlement impacts are avoided by \nscheduling the civil works during the 8-month fallow period, dismantling the old towers and installing the new ones piece by \npiece, and use of poles instead of towers in sites where houses are close by.    \n \n \nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \n1.  Discuss the impact channels of the policy reform(s) (direct and indirect, short and medium term) to the country and major \ngroups affected.  Not Applicable \n \n2.  Discuss the impact of the policy reform(s) on vulnerable groups and ways to address it/them (refer to social analysis).  \n         Not Applicable \n \n3.

If some crops are affected during the civil works, the owner \nwill be compensated with an amount equivalent to 1 year\u2019s production.  \n \n2. The main beneficiaries of the Project are industries in Baku. The improvement of the quality and availability of power supply \nare bound to enhance their production and employment-generating capacity. \n \n3. The improvement of employment will benefit the urban poor.  \n \n4. Domestic users will also benefit from the improved quality and availability of power supply by encouraging home \nbusiness\u2014extending time for work and recreation, and enhancing social services among others.  \n \n5. The improved quality and availability of electricity will increase women\u2019s access to information and technology; and \nincrease their income generation capacity, physical mobility, ability to organize work based on convenience, knowledge on \ngender issues, and decision making power. \n \n6. No indigenous peoples groups will be affected.          \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nThere were meetings with local officials and representatives of nongovernment organizations, youth groups, and media on \n11 and 12 April in Mingechevir and Agsu to inform them about the Project and draw out their concerns. About 18 persons \nattended each meeting. About six meetings were held with people cultivating under the existing lines to elicit their concerns \nover the Project and inform them of the design measures to be taken to avoid any adverse impacts. In these meetings, they \nwere also informed of the plan to compensate for any destroyed crops with an amount equivalent to 1 year\u2019s production. Their \nrecommendations to further avoid any potential impacts were also solicited.      \n \n2.

If no, explain why.  \nBecause of the minimal adverse social impact expected if any, a C&P plan was deemed unnecessary. \n \nC.   Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues.  \n \nThe Project is expected to benefit women in various aspects. Like any other project that increases the quality and availability \nof power supply, it is expected to enhance their income-generation capacity, physical mobility, ability to organize work based \non convenience, knowledge on gender issues, and decision making power.         \n \n \n \n2.
