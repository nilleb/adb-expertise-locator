I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste for the additional financing of the Road Network \nUpgrading Project.  \n \n2.  The proposed additional financing will support a change in the scope of the  Road \nNetwork Upgrading Project. The Government of Timor-Leste will construct a new international \nport at Tibar west of Dili, which is currently served by a road included in the scope of the original \nproject. To provide sufficient capacity, 5.0 kilometers (km) of the road will be designed and \nconstructed to a significantly higher standard than originally envisaged. The additional financing \nwill also help finance cost overruns in the original project arising from civil works costs that were \nhigher than expected. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  In 2011, the government published its strategic development plan (SDP), 2011\u20132030, \nwhich aims to sustain economic growth and fast-track economic development to achieve a \nmodern and diversified economy with high-quality infrastructure.1 The SDP envisages three \npillars for development: social capital development, infrastructure development, and economic \ndevelopment. Public investment (including roads) over the first 5 years of the SDP is intended to \ncreate the conditions to attract private investment and ensure that the economy is led by the \nprivate sector by 2030. An efficient and safe transport system is essential to achieving the three \ndevelopmental pillars. The SDP and the operational plans of the government emphasize the \nupgrading of roads. \n \n4.  Since 1999, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been the lead development agency \nin the road subsector, for which it has provided six technical assistance projects, three project \ngrants, one sector grant, and two loans. The country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132015 continues \nADB\u2019s strategic directions by concentrating on infrastructure development and management. \nADB plans to provide complementary assistance in the core specializations of finance, regional \ncooperation and integration, and education. 2 ADB will also support the private sector as a key \ndriver of change to help make the transition from an economy led by the public sector.3 ADB \nsupport for infrastructure, financial services, and skills training will help meet the needs of a \ngrowing economy. An emphasis on the provision of services outside the capital will support \ngrowth of the rural economy. Poverty will be reduced, particularly in rural areas, by connecting \nthe poor to markets and expanding the availability of basic public services.  \n \n5.  The original project was approved in March 2012, and became effective in June 2012. 4 \nThe original project intended to (i) reconstruct or upgrade and climate proof about 59 km of \nprincipal national roads, (ii) expand the road maintenance program of the Ministry of Public \nWorks (MPW), and (iii) complete a feasibility study and detailed design for 81 km of principal \n                                                \n1  Government of Timor-Leste. 2011.

Manila. \n ", "2   \nnational roads. The executing agency is the Council for the Administration of the Infrastructure \nFund (CAFI) through its Major Projects Secretariat, and the implementing agency is the MPW. 5 \n \n6.  The original project includes a component for upgrading the existing road between Dili \nand Liquica. This responded directly to the SDP which envisages completion of this 28 km \nsection by 2015. The road is part of the north coast road linking Dili with the Indonesian border \nat Mota Ain and with the western towns of Maliana and Bobonaro. The component is intended \nto facilitate increased and more efficient movement of people and goods between the districts \nand the capital as well as cross-border trade with Indonesia. \n \n7.  The government has confirmed its intention to relocate the international port in Dili to \nTibar with operations envisaged to commence by 2018. Tibar is situated on the Dili\u2013Liquica \nroad, the upgrading of which is included in the project. There has been substantial growth in \nfreight volumes through Dili port and it is expected to reach its capacity by 2015. Accelerated \nconstruction and operation of a new port under a public\u2013private partnership is now planned. The \ncurrent project scope includes only rehabilitation between Dili and Tibar following the existing \nroad. However, the winding alignment, coastal exposure, and areas of hillside instability will \nbecome a constraint on future upgrading, which will be required in light of the planned port \ndevelopment. \n \n8.  A reassessment of the scope of the original component has been undertaken. In addition \nto the traffic now expected to be generated by the port development, the reassessment found \nthat there had been higher-than-expected growth in the base traffic, averaging 19% per year \nsince 2009. This growth is attributable to population growth in the immediate area of 8% per \nannum and development of business (particularly warehousing) in Tibar. The reassessment \nfound that a road of significantly higher geometric standard than that currently included in the \nproject scope is required. A dual carriageway, 5.0 km long (partly on a new alignment), has \nbeen found to be feasible as a long-term solution. It will improve the alignment and avoid the \ncoastal and unstable areas. It will also shorten the distance between Dili and the new port by 2 \nkm (see map). The construction cost is estimated to be significantly higher than the cost of \nconstruction of the originally envisaged scope. However, economic and financial analysis shows \nthe  changed  project to  be  viable,  with  an  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of 27.3%.  The \ngovernment has requested additional financing  to finance additional costs arising from the \nchanged scope as the proposed changes can readily be implemented under the existing project \narrangements. \n \n9.  In addition, bids received for civil works under the original project were approximately \n30% higher than anticipated and the additional cost cannot be fully met by the contingency \namount included in the original financing plan. The components continue to be economically \nviable and are high government priorities. The government has therefore requested additional \nfinancing to also help finance this cost overrun. \n \n10.  Regarding the performance of the project to date, procurement of civil works (output 1) \nhas suffered delay because of capacity constraints in the National Procurement Commission \n(NPC), which is responsible for managing all major public procurement. A newly established \nbody with responsibility for final endorsement of government contracts (the Audit Court) caused \ndelays in meeting contractual conditions precedent to commencement of work. Progress on \noutput 1 was 14 months behind schedule by the time construction commenced in November \n2013. Disbursement performance in 2013 was therefore significantly affected and behind the \noriginal projections ($4.7 million versus $17.0 million projected as of February 2014). Revisions \n                                                \n5  The MPW is the successor to the Ministry of Infrastructure. \n ", "3 \nto  the  disbursement  forecast  have  been  made  based  on  the  status  of  disbursements  in \nFebruary 2014, and disbursements since then have been satisfactory. However, the original \nproject is considered to be not performing well because the original disbursement projections \nwere not met in the 12-month period preceding cross-departmental review of this proposal for \nadditional financing.6 \n    \n11.  A contract for the supervision of construction of the two roads and for the design of a \nfurther 81 km of road was procured and awarded without significant delay by December 2012 \nand work commenced in January 2013. The consulting firm has performed satisfactorily and \ncompleted the required feasibility study and detailed engineering design (output 2) by August \n2013. This has supported processing of subsequent ADB loans.7  \n \n12.  The  delays  may  be  ascribed  to  a  learning  period  within  the  various  government \nagencies, as new processes are bedded into government systems and capacity to use the \nsystems effectively is improved. Recent experience is that the NPC is competent and is steadily \nreducing  the  time  required  to  conduct  bid  processes.8 The  Audit  Court  must  now  review \ngovernment  contracts  within  30  days.  Works  contracts  under  the  original  project  are  now \nproceeding satisfactorily and are expected to be completed by end of 2015. There is no current \nimpediment to achieving the project outputs. Successful completion of civil works is the key \nfactor in achieving the project outcome. Compliance with safeguards is satisfactory. Project \nperformance and associated issues are described in more detail in the summary of project \nperformance.9 \n \n13.  The changed project meets all eligibility criteria for additional financing.10 The project \nremains  technically  feasible,  economically  viable,  and  financially  sound  and  infrastructure \ndevelopment, including upgrading of roads and construction of a new port, are high government \npriorities.  The  changed  project  remains  consistent  with  the  development  objectives  of  the \noriginal project and is consistent with the current country partnership strategy. The existing \nproject implementation arrangements remain satisfactory (though some additional resources are \nrequired) and an extension of the existing loans of only 1 year is needed to accommodate \naccrued delays and the changed scope of work. All components are being executed within the \nsame geographical area, therefore arrangements for construction supervision can be extended \nto the changed project. The safeguards categorization of the project is unchanged.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n14.  The impact of the project will be increased and more efficient movement of people and \ngoods. The outcome will be that the MPW provides a more reliable and safer road network. The \nimpact and outcome are unchanged by the changed output. New performance targets for the \nchanged output (the road section connecting Dili to the new international port) are included in \nthe revised design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1).  \n \n                                                \n6   ADB. 2011.

All \noutputs with the exception of output 1 are unchanged: \n(i)  Output 1: National roads will be upgraded and climate proofed. Upgrading of \nthe roads from Dili to Liquica (28.6 km) and Tibar to Gleno (31.0 km) are original \ncomponents of Output 1. The Dili to Liquica components will be changed from \nupgrading of the road from Dili airport road junction to Liquica to upgrading of the \nroad from Tacitolu to Liquica. The changed component will therefore comprise: (i) \nrealignment and upgrading to four lanes from Taciltolu to the junction with the \nTibar to Gleno road including construction of a roundabout at this junction (3.2 \nkm), (ii) upgrading to four lanes from the roundabout to Tibar Port entrance (2 \nkm) including provision for port access and (iii) widening to 6 meters (m) and \nstrengthening of the road from Tibar Port entrance to Liquica (19.1 km). The \nTibar to Gleno component which commences at the junction with the above \ncomponent  will  be  unchanged  from  its  present  strengthening  and  widening \nexisting sealed pavements from a width of generally less than 4.5 m to 6 m with \nasphalt surfacing. Vulnerability to damage from severe rainfall, sea level rise, and \nother potential effects of climate change for all roads will be reduced through \nengineering  counter-measures,  including  ensuring  suitably-sized  drainage \nstructures, raising of road levels that are flood-prone, and bio-engineering to \npromote slope stability. \n(ii)  Output  2:  A  feasibility  study  and  detailed  design  will  be  prepared.  A \nfeasibility study and detailed design suitable for ADB financing will be prepared \nfor the road from Manatuto to Natarbora (81.0 km). The additional loan will help \nfinance the detailed design of the road from Comoro roundabout to Tibar Port \nentrance. \n(iii)  Output 3: Performance-based road maintenance will be introduced. The civil \nworks contractors  will  be  responsible for maintenance  of the  upgraded  road \nsections for 2 years after physical completion. Local contractors will be trained in \nperformance maintenance, and period performance-based contracts will be used \nfor future maintenance. \n(iv)  Output 4: Awareness of road safety and transport-related social issues will \nbe raised. The awareness of road safety will be increased by implementing a \ncommunity-based  road  safety  awareness  program,  including  an  education \nprogram for schools, drivers, road users, and the community, and implementing \nan HIV/AIDS prevention and a human trafficking awareness program. \n(v)  Output  5:  Efficient  project  management  will  be  provided.  The  project \nincludes  project  management  support  for  the  implementing  agency  through \nstrengthening of its project management unit (PMU). \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n \n16.  The total cost of the project after additional financing is estimated to be $79.88 million \n(Table 1).11 Collaborative cofinancing from the Japan International Cooperation Agency for \n$93.0 million is excluded from Tables 1 and 2 for clarity.12  \n                                                \n11 The additional financing will be for the upgrading and construction supervision of the road from Tasitolu to Tibar, \ncost overruns for the Tibar to Liquica and Tibar to Gleno components, and strengthening the capacity of the PMU \nand government agencies for land acquisition and resettlement. \n12  The Japan International Cooperation Agency has provided a loan to the Government of Timor-Leste for the \nupgrading of the road from Dili to Baucau, and this was included as collaborative financing in the original.

The government has requested a loan of $11.78 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 25-year term (straight line repayment \nmethod), including a grace period of 5 years, an annual interest rate determined in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge \nof 0.15% per year (the interest and other charges during construction to be capitalized in the \nloan), and such other terms and conditions set forth in the loan agreement. Based on this, the \naverage loan maturity is 15.25 years and the maturity premium payable to ADB is 0.1% per \nannum. The loan from ADB will finance civil works, consultants\u2019 services, taxes and duties, late \npayment charges imposed by suppliers and contractors, bank charges, and interest during \nconstruction on the ordinary capital resources loan.13 The government has provided ADB with (i) \nthe reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility based on these \nterms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent \ndecision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB.   \n \n18.  The financing plan is in Table 2. The government has assured ADB that it will meet any \nfinancing shortfall to ensure project outputs are fully implemented.  \n \n                                                                                                                                                       \nagency\u2019s part of the project is proceeding satisfactorily, with invitations for bids for civil works issued in the second \nquarter of 2014. \n13 Financing of late payment charges and bank charges will avoid potential administrative delays.

Implementation Arrangements \n19.  An existing PMU within the MPW is responsible for the management of the original \nproject and will also manage the changed outputs. The PMU is headed by a project manager \nand staffed with key professionals on a full-time basis, including a chief technical advisor, road \nconstruction advisor, road maintenance engineer, and financial administrator. Supplementary \nstaff have been recruited to the PMU and financed under the original project, and also under the \nADB-financed Road Network Upgrading Sector Project (footnote 7). The supplementary staff of \ninternational and national specialists provide for a full-time safeguards unit within the PMU. The \nPMU  will  continue  to  be  responsible  for  financial  management  and  preparing  withdrawal \napplications. The existing Road Network Upgrading Project design and supervision consultant is \nresponsible for construction supervision of the Tibar to Liquica and Tibar to Gleno components \n(under its existing contract) and for the additional Tasitolu to Tibar component (under a contract \nvariation).  \n \n20.  While the day-to-day management of the project will be undertaken by the PMU, the \ngovernment\u2019s  National  Development  Agency  will  review  quality,  costs,  and  payments  in \naccordance with the government\u2019s internal procedures. While the PMU, assisted by the design \nand  supervision  consultants,  will  prepare  draft  bidding  documents  for  procurement  of  the \nadditional component, the NPC will be responsible for conducting the bidding process, including \nbid evaluation. \n \n21.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical  \n22.  Upgrading of roads will include side slope  stabilization, drainage improvement, and \npavement reconstruction and widening. This will involve construction of retaining structures and \nuse of bioengineering works for slope stabilization, improved drainage, and strengthened and \nwidened road pavements. Widening will be carried out only where technically and economically \nfeasible in light of challenging geotechnical conditions in some locations. In the changed project, \nthe road from Tasitolu to Tibar port entrance will be upgraded to dual carriageway standard to \nincrease its capacity. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n23.  Economic  assessment  of  the  components  has  been  undertaken  utilizing  the  roads \neconomic decision model, a derivative of the highway development and management model. \n ", "8   \nThe original project was found to have a rate of return of 16%. Sensitivity tests were applied and \nthe economic internal rates of return remained above 10% under all scenarios analyzed. The \nchanged Liquica to Tibar road was found to have a rate of return of 27.3% and remained above \n12.0% under all sensitivity scenarios. Maintaining the unimproved road to a basic serviceable \nstandard is estimated to cost $0.25 million per year, compared with $0.09 million per year for \nthe upgraded road. The government has adequate financial capacity to finance maintenance of \nits infrastructure assets.  \n \nC.  Governance \n24.  The public financial management system is heavily centralized with numerous controls \nthat have resulted in bottlenecks that slow payment processes. Decentralization of noncore \nfinancial  management  functions  from  the  Ministry  of  Finance  to  line  ministries  has  been \npromoted,  as  capacity  within  these  agencies  has  increased  but  the  system  for  contract \npayments continues to involve a number of agencies. \n \n25.  The NPC was established in 2011 and is responsible for all procurement over $1 million. \nIts  performance  to  date  has  been  satisfactory,  albeit  slow  because  of  internal  capacity \nconstraints. The transparency and efficiency of procurement still needs improvement, and a \nbalance between risk and accountability for projects without development partner oversight has \nnot yet been achieved. \n \n26.  The  executing  agency,  CAFI,  was  established  in  2011  to  oversee  the  use  of  the \ninfrastructure fund.15 The Civil Service Act (2004) provides standards, principles, definitions, and \nguidelines  for  civil  service  administration;  a  code  of  ethics  for  civil  servants;  and  an \nadministrative disciplinary mechanism. A law creating the new Anti-Corruption Commission \nbecame effective in 2009, and the first anticorruption commissioner was appointed in 2010. \nHowever,  the  independence  of  this  commission  needs  to  be  assured  and  it  needs  to  be \nresourced effectively. \n \n27.  The MPW has implemented a number of ADB-supported infrastructure projects through \nits  PMU  since  2010,  including  the  Road  Network  Development  Sector  Project,  the  Road \nNetwork Upgrading Project, and the Road Network Upgrading Sector Project. Its performance \nwith  regard  to  financial  management  has  been  satisfactory,  though  delays  have  been \nexperienced  because  of  controls  and  reviews  of  certified  payments  conducted  by  other \nagencies, including the Ministry of Finance. The PMU has sufficient capacity to manage the \nchanged project. \n \n28.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and CAFI. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the project administration manual (footnote 14). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n29.  The primary beneficiaries of the original project are (i) road users, including vehicle \ndrivers  and  passengers  and/or  nonmotorized  transport  users;  (ii)  households  living  in \ncommunities in the catchment areas of the upgraded road links that sell a range of cash crops \nand  other  agricultural  produce;  (iii)  passenger  and  goods  transport  service  providers  and \ncommercial truck drivers; and (iv) small businesses and traders including vendors at local \n                                                \n15 The infrastructure fund is derived from the petroleum-revenue-financed sovereign wealth fund and is used for \nfinancing infrastructure development. \n ", "9 \nmarkets, trade store owners, coffee and other produce buyers, and small and medium-sized \nenterprises in the district capitals and towns. The changed project will also benefit businesses \nengaged in import and export of goods through provision of a shorter and more efficient land \ntransport link between the port and Dili. Lower transport costs will contribute to lower prices for \nimported goods, which will benefit all segments of society, especially the poor. \n \n30.   The project is classified as effective gender mainstreaming and is designed to ensure \ngender equality and allow women\u2019s empowerment by ensuring that the views and requirements \nof women are fully considered in the design of the components. Women\u2019s involvement in all \nemployment and training opportunities under the changed project will continue to be actively \npromoted.16 Specifically, the project will encourage and facilitate (i) incorporation of the views of \nwomen in the project design; (ii) awareness of gender and transport security, human trafficking, \nand  HIV/AIDS,  (iii)  a  reasonable quota for  women\u2019s  involvement  in the  construction  work, \ndirected  toward  unemployed  widows,  female  heads  of  households  with  large  numbers  of \ndependents,  and  other  vulnerable  groups;  and  (iv)  a  quota  for  women\u2019s  involvement  in \nbioengineering and maintenance works. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n31.  Environment. The project is classified category B. An environmental assessment and \nreview  framework  and  initial  environmental  examinations  were  prepared  for  both  original \ncomponents.  An  initial  environmental  examination  has  been  prepared  for  the  changed \ncomponent. The original project\u2019s environmental impacts are site specific and temporary. They \ninclude  (i)  disturbance  from  dust  arising  from  loading,  unloading,  and  transportation  of \nconstruction materials; (ii) noise; (iii) erosion and sedimentation from exposed surfaces during \nconstruction that may affect water courses; (iv) risks from the use and disposal of hazardous \nmaterials such as fuel and lubricants; and (v) increased risk of accidents from increased vehicle \nmovements. The new component has more significant but manageable impacts, including loss \nof vegetation in the area of the new alignment and widening alongside 200 m of coastline. \nMitigation measures have been incorporated in all components as outlined in the environmental \nmanagement plans. The PMU will implement the environmental management plans and employ \na full-time national environment specialist and a full-time international specialist in its safeguards \nunit to monitor and report on progress.  \n \n32.  Resettlement. The additional financing project is classified category B on involuntary \nresettlement. The road widening under the additional financing will impact private land (0.71 \nhectares) and assets, including 11 houses, eight kiosks, four fences, and several trees. A total \nof 15 households (109 persons) will be affected. A resettlement plan has been prepared in \naccordance  with  the  government-endorsed  resettlement  framework  for  the  Road  Network \nUpgrading  Project  and  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).17 The  resettlement  plan \nincludes necessary measures on compensation and resettlement assistance to enhance or \nrestore the living standards of affected persons.18 The plan will be updated, and compensation \nand relocation activities completed before the start of civil works on the affected land. The PMU \nwill implement the resettlement plans and employ a full-time national specialist and a full-time \ninternational specialist in its safeguards unit to monitor and report on progress. The project will \nalso strengthen the capacity of the PMU and government agencies on land acquisition and \nresettlement. Additional consultant services will include a resettlement specialist, a legal advisor, \nand a resettlement coordinator. \n                                                \n16  Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17  Resettlement Plan for Tasitolu\u2013Tibar (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18 The resettlement plan has been posted on the ADB website and disclosed locally to affected persons. \n ", "10   \n33.  Indigenous  persons.  The  additional  financing  project  is  classified  category  C  for \nindigenous peoples. No distinct and vulnerable indigenous peoples as defined under ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement are expected to be affected by the project. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n34.  No significant additional issues have arisen from the risks identified for the original \nproject. Slow procurement and delayed disbursement have affected project implementation. \nProcurement performance has improved (footnote 6) and disbursement will be dependent on \nphysical progress which is now satisfactory. Major risks and mitigating measures are described \nin  detail  in the risk  assessment  and  risk management  plan.19 The  integrated  benefits  and \nimpacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n35.  The government and CAFI have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the project administration manual and loan documents. \n \n36.  The government and CAFI have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, \nwhich are set forth in the loan agreement.  \n \n37.  The government has agreed that no withdrawals can be made from the loan account \nsubcategory for Works in respect of any works from Tibar roundabout to Gleno and Tibar \nroundabout to Liquica until all of the allocated funds for the works and unallocated categories of \nthe original loans have been fully disbursed.   \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n38.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$11,780,000 to the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste for the additional financing of the Road \nNetwork  Upgrading  Project,  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  to  be \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility; for a term of 25 years, \nincluding a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n \n \n3 October 2014   \n                                                \n19 Risk Assessment
