The transactional technical assistance (TRTA) cluster was approved on 8 April 2020 with \nan allocation of $3,000,000 and completion date of 31 December 2022. The TRTA outcome is \ngender mainstreaming in Central and West Asia operations expanded and improved.  The two \noutputs are: (i) gender-inclusive components in sovereign projects and programs incorporated; \nand (ii) DMC capacity for gender action plan (GAP) implementation and monitoring of gender \nequality results enhanced. Subproject 1 of the TRTA was approved on 15 April 2020 in the amount \nof $300,000, which was financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund \n(TASF-6 = $250,000 and TASF-Others = $50,000). The original completion date of Subproject 1 \nwas extended by 1 month from 31 December 2020 to 31 January 2021.1 Subproject 1 has the \nfollowing outputs: (i) semi-annual GAP updates of ongoing gender equity theme (GEN) and \neffective gender mainstreaming (EGM) projects, and updates on gender actions in some gender \nelements (SGE) projects collected and enhanced; (ii) project completion reports (PCRs) of GEN- \nand  EGM-categorized  projects  prepared;  and  (iii)  in-country  capacity  building  activities \nconducted. The subproject is currently implementing activities under outputs (i) and (ii). Activities \nunder output 3 have yet to be implemented in view of the restrictions brought about by the \ncoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SUBPROJECT \n \nA.  Subproject Scope \n \n2.  The Central and West Asia Department (CWRD) has 168 projects in its portfolio as of \nOctober 2020, including 160 with gender categorization.2 The percentage share of projects in the \ntransport and energy sectors combined comprise 52% of the portfolio. However, both sectors \nhave very low numbers of projects  categorized as GEN and EGM  with 23%  for transport and \n13% for energy. The low numbers of GEN- and EGM-categorized projects in these sectors \nindicate the need for increased efforts in gender mainstreaming. Other sectors that require more \ninitiatives on gender mainstreaming include finance and public sector management. Persistent \nchallenges affect gender mainstreaming in project design and implementation of the GAPs of \nGEN- and EGM-categorized projects and gender actions in SGE-categorized projects. These \ninclude limited capacity of EAs/IAs in gender mainstreaming and implementation of GAPs and \ngender resource allocations to fully fund continuous engagements of  project gender consultants. \nThe widespread impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that hit over 200  countries and territories, \nincluding countries in Central and West Asia, has made the implementation and monitoring of \nGAPs and gender actions in SGE projects more challenging due to restrictions in mobility and the \nneed to observe social distancing. The subproject will provide support for increased efforts to \nintegrate gender in project design, promote effective implementation, monitoring, and reporting of \nprogress of GAPs and gender targets in the design and monitoring frameworks (DMFs) of 75 \nprojects categorized as GEN and EGM and 42 projects categorized as SGE in the portfolio. The \nsubproject will also help pursue the implementation of gender policy actions in policy-based loans \n \n1  TA9962-REG: Monitoring and Achieving Gender Targets in Central and West Asia Operations Subproject 1\u2014Minor \nChange in Implementation Arrangements and Extension of TA Completion Date which was approved on 3 November \n2020. \n2  The remaining 8 projects are for Project Readiness Facilities (PRFs) and project design advances (PDAs). \n ", "2 \n(PBLs), gender targets in the disbursement-linked indicators (DLIs) and gender actions in the \nprogram action plans (PAPs) of results-based loans (RBLs).   \n \n3.   The subproject will aid gender mainstreaming in the design and preparation of projects \ncategorized as GEN and EGM. It will facilitate the development of subprojects for key projects in \nchallenging  sectors  (energy,  finance,  public  sector  management,  and  transport).  These \nsubprojects will include gender actions aligned with the targets and transformative agenda of \nSustainable Development Goals (SDG) 5. The subproject will carry on the activities and outputs \ndone under Subproject 1. These include support for the implementation of GAPs, collection and \nreview  of  semi-annual  updates  of  GEN-  and  EGM-categorized  project  GAPs  and  SGE-\ncategorized project gender actions and targets, drafting of gender sections of PCRs, and reporting \non gender equality results of the projects. It will also complete the development of the gender \ndatabase which was started under TA 90883  and piloted for Uzbekistan. The database will aid in \nthe systematic monitoring of GAP accomplishments and achievement of gender targets in the \nCorporate Results Framework. The subproject will conduct in-country capacity building activities \nto  develop  the  knowledge  and  skills  of  EAs/IAs  in  mainstreaming  gender  in  projects, \nimplementation and monitoring of GAPs, and reporting on gender equality results. The capacity \nbuilding activities will include identification of good approaches on implementation of GAPs and \ngender initiatives within the context of the restrictions brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. \nThese activities will also be used as opportunities to draw lessons from the challenges in \nimplementation,  monitoring,  and  reporting,  especially  in  the  energy,  finance,  public  sector \nmanagement, and transport sectors and in the  difficult modalities for gender mainstreaming, such \nas policy-based lending (PBL) and results-based lending (RBL). In addition, these will recommend \ninnovative approaches to deepen gender mainstreaming in agriculture, education, health, and \nurban services. The subproject will conduct a subregional workshop to foster exchange of good \npractices and lessons learned in development and implementation of gender-responsive projects \nand initiatives related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The initiatives of the subproject will complement \nand contribute to the efforts and attainment of the objectives of the CAREC Gender Strategy.  \nThese include identification and rolling out of good practices in mainstreaming gender in CAREC \nprojects and conducting capacity development activities as part of the regional gender action plan. \n \nB.
