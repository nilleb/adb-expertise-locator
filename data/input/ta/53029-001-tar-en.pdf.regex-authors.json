INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Government of Mongolia requested knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) \nfrom the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to support the preparation of a regional private sector \ndevelopment policy and capacity building of the rural-based private sector.1 The TA will assist the \ngovernment in formulating an effective private sector development strategy for the eastern region \nof Mongolia in alignment with the objectives of the Mongolia Sustainable Development Vision \n2030 and the Mongolia Regional Development Concept (MRDC).2 The TA will contribute to \noperational priorities 5 (promoting rural development and food security) and 6 (strengthening \ngovernance and institutional capacity) of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Since  the  start  of  Mongolia\u2019s transition to  a market  economy  in  1991,  income  and \ndevelopment disparities have emerged between the country\u2019s urban and rural areas. For instance, \nat 34.9%, the rural poverty rate exceeds the national average (29.6%). Adequate infrastructure is \nvirtually absent in rural areas, as evidenced by the 2018 Logistic Performance Index, which \nranked  Mongolia  130th  out  of  160  economies.4 Not  surprisingly,  the  rural  private  sector\u2019s \ncontribution to the national economy is marginal except for a small number of large mines. This \nhampers employment and income-generation opportunities. As a consequence, the government \nhas made rural development a priority, targeting the promotion of rural industrialization strategies, \nthe development of value chains and activities, and fostering socioeconomic equality between \nurban and rural areas through the optimal utilization of the country\u2019s abundant natural resources. \n \n3.  A sustainable regional development policy is required to boost the rural economy, and it \nneeds to be underpinned by regional strategies for private sector development. Although the \ngovernment approved the MRDC in 2001, the resulting achievements have not met expectations. \nAgainst this background, the Prime Minister\u2019s Cabinet Secretariat and the National Development \nAgency (NDA) have been tasked with updating the MRDC and preparing policy and regulatory \ndocuments that reflect the current development needs. A critical part of the MRDC is to formulate \nthe strategies needed to develop the private sector and to ensure that the scarce public resources \nare used to deliver the public goods that will drive forward sustainable private economic activity. \nAlthough the net migration rate of eastern Mongolia is the lowest among the regions outside the \ncapital, Ulaanbaatar, special attention should be given to education and access to financial \nservices at regional and provincial level to strengthen local labor market participants. \n \n4.  ADB supported the government\u2019s efforts to design a regional development policy in 2015 \nunder a TA project that produced the first private sector development strategy in the country with \na focus on the five aimags (provinces) of western Mongolia.5 As a follow-up to this previous \nsupport, the Cabinet Secretariat requested ADB to replicate the project in eastern Mongolia. This \nTA will focus on Dornod, Khentii, and Sukhbaatar aimags. Eastern Mongolia is heavily dependent \non mining, animal husbandry, and services. However, despite its abundant natural endowment, it \nhas not tapped the potential from its wealth of minerals, animals, fish, and crop farming. For \n                                                \n1  The TA was requested by the Ministry of Finance during the country programming confirmation mission in November \n2018. The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 16 May 2019. \n2  Government of Mongolia. 2016. Mongolia Sustainable Development Vision 2030.

Manila. \n ", "2 \ninstance, despite accounting for about 18% of the country\u2019s land area and more than 15% of its \ntotal livestock, the region only contributes 8% of overall agriculture production in Mongolia. \nEastern Mongolia is bordered by the People\u2019s Republic of China and the Russian Federation, the \nbiggest economies in Northeast Asia. In this regard, tourism and animal product manufacturing \ncan be further developed in the region. Moreover, the three eastern aimags are among the most \nunderdeveloped,  sparsely  populated,  and  isolated  provinces  in  Mongolia,  with  an  alarming \npoverty rate of 43.9%. The TA will determine the priority sectors in the region\u2019s economy, \nformulate a strategy to tap local resources, and promote information sharing and coordination \nbetween the aimags to achieve synergies and economies of scale. This will be supported by the \npreparation of a comprehensive private sector development policy for the region. The TA will also \nprovide capacity-building support to ensure the successful implementation and sustainability of \nthe regional strategy. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n5.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: private sector participation in achieving the \nMRDC goals enhanced.6 The TA will have the following outcome: readiness for value-added \nactivities that advance private sector development in the three eastern aimags enhanced.7 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n6.  Output 1: Aimags\u2019 economic competitiveness and potential assessed. The objective \nwill be to define and assess the competitive and priority sectors for each aimag, as well as identify \nthe key constraints that hinder local private sector development. This will complement the existing \neconomic competitiveness index by providing a comprehensive analysis of the region\u2019s economic \nsectors and priorities. The TA team will thus be able to pinpoint the economic potential of the \nregion and can focus on formulating a private sector development strategy that meets the specific \nneeds of eastern Mongolia. \n \n7.  Output 2: Eastern Mongolia\u2019s private sector development strategy formulated. The \nTA team will design an action plan to develop the local economy in eastern Mongolia. The actions \nwill include an assessment of the demand-and-supply situation in the three aimags and a \nproduction capacity survey. Moreover, the team will prepare economic projections for each aimag. \nThe final deliverable will be a private sector development policy document for eastern Mongolia. \n \n8.  Output 3: Regional agribusiness cluster models designed. This output will focus on \nthe design and planning of export-oriented regional agribusiness clusters. The TA team will \nidentify opportunities to integrate micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises into international \nvalue chains, and design schemes for technology-enhanced business models and microfinance \nfacilities to support the proposed clusters. The output will include (i) investment and market \nstudies for selected private sector opportunities in priority sectors with a focus on value-added \nactivities and exports; and (ii) training of public and private sector participants in the areas of \nagronomy, financial planning, supply chain management, and export documentation. \n \n9.  Output  4:  Coordination  and  information  sharing  for  economic  development \nbetween the three eastern aimags strengthened. The TA will support the establishment of \n                                                \n6  Government of Mongolia. 2001. Mongolia Regional Development Concept. Ulaanbaatar. \n7  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "3 \nprovincial  public\u2013private  dialogue  councils  (PPDCs)  in  the  three  eastern  aimags,  and  a \ncentralized (regional) PPDC to facilitate coordination between them. The PPDCs will help local \ngovernments to streamline their investment and private sector development operations and to \noptimize the use of their limited fiscal resources. Moreover, PPDCs will become a communication \ntool  to  deliver  the  messages  of  local  private  sector  participants  to  the  central  and  local \ngovernments. The TA will also support the development of a web-based online catalogue to \npromote information sharing and local private sector marketing. The catalogue will include micro, \nsmall, and medium-sized enterprises from Mongolia\u2019s western and eastern regions, and may be \nreplicated nationwide at a later stage. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n10.  The TA is estimated to cost $625,000, of which $600,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF  6).  The  estimated  value  of  in-kind \ncontributions from the Government of Mongolia is $25,000. The key expenditure items are listed \nin Appendix 2. The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff \nremuneration, office accommodation, logistics and administrative support, and other in-kind \ncontributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n11.  ADB  will  implement  the  TA from  1 July  2019  to  31  December  2021.  The  Cabinet \nSecretariat will be the executing agency and the local aimag governments of Dornod, Khentii, and \nSukhbaatar will be the implementing agencies. ADB\u2019s Mongolia Resident Mission will lead the TA \nunder the One ADB approach by working closely with other ADB departments, including (i) the \nDepartment of Communications (regarding the conduct of workshops and training programs and \nthe publication of knowledge products); and (ii) the Office of Information Systems and Technology \n(regarding the procurement of equipment, software, and other information technology needs).8 \n \n12.  With support from the Cabinet Secretariat, the local aimag governments will form the \nregional PPDC, which will include representatives from local governments and the private sector, \nto guide the TA. The deputy head of the Cabinet Secretariat will lead the regional PPDC. The \nCabinet Secretariat will present the proposed composition of the regional PPDC to ADB for no-\nobjection approval. The TA coordinator will be responsible for facilitating this PPDC. Strong \nemphasis will be placed on sustainably building the capacity of public and private sector personnel. \nTo achieve this, government officials and representatives of local chambers of commerce will lead \nthe design and implementation of key initiatives, while TA consultants play an active supporting \nrole. Thus, the TA will provide an important learning-by-doing exercise that will (i) build internal \ncapacity, (ii) strengthen the operational framework, and (iii) sustain the TA results. Domestic study \ntours will allow the three eastern aimags to gain and share valuable knowledge, and learn from \nADB\u2019s previous TA in western Mongolia (footnote 5). \n \n13.  TA support for conferences and workshops may include costs related to the venue, \nequipment rental, translations, printing and copying, meals, transportation, lodging, logistics and \nadministrative support, and other expenditures with prior agreement from ADB. In line with \nstandard ADB procedures, the TA will not support the executing agency\u2019s management fees or \nrelated  costs  such  as  staff  salaries.  Other  executing  agency  resources,  such  as  office \naccommodation, will be provided as part of the government\u2019s in-kind contribution. \n                                                \n8  The project team will explore collaboration with Germany\u2019s Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), \nthe Japan International Cooperation Agency, and other development partners. \n ", "4 \n14.

Consulting services. ADB will engage eight consultants and one consulting firm to \ndeliver the TA outputs. It will hire two international consultants, one as the project team leader, \nand six national consultants. Additionally, ADB will recruit a consulting firm through cost-quality \nselection. Given the required expertise, ADB will engage the consultants on an individual basis. \nLump-sum payment contracts for consulting services will be considered where appropriate. ADB \nwill engage the consultants following the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time \nto time) and its associated project administration instructions and/or staff instructions.9 \n \n16.  The consultants will be responsible for producing the TA outputs and deliverables in a \ntimely and effective manner, and for organizing and carrying out all TA activities. Consultants will \nreport to the ADB project officer. ADB will evaluate the progress of the TA during review missions \nand workshops, based on the performance targets and indicators defined in the design and \nmonitoring framework (Appendix 1). \n \n \n                                                \n9  Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n ", "5 \n17.
