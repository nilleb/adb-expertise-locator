INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Asian Development Outlook (ADO) is one of the flagship publications of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). By providing insights into the economic issues faced by Asia and the \nPacific, it has become one of the main vehicles to promote ADB\u2019s knowledge and expertise \nabout the region. Its content informs ADB Management opinion and guides institutional views \nabout  the  region\u2019s  macroeconomic  prospects  and  important  development  issues.  The \nproduction of the ADO has been regularly supported by technical assistance (TA) funding.1 The \nobjectives, scope, and activities to be covered by the regional TA are in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020  identified  poverty  reduction  and  inclusive \neconomic growth as strategic priorities that will guide ADB\u2019s work through 2020.3 The ADO, with \nits  comprehensive  analysis  of  evolving  macroeconomic  developments  in  ADB\u2019s  developing \nmember countries (DMCs), provides a basis for understanding the key drivers of and constraints \non economic growth\u2014a critical element for inclusive economic growth. This important role of \nflagship publications such as the ADO in monitoring the major economic issues and trends of \nDMCs was recognized in the TA Strategic Forum 2008. Under ADB\u2019s streamlined business \nprocesses, the ADO is one of the main references for the economic assessment and outlook \nsection of country partnership strategies. Furthermore, in line with the 2013 staff guidelines to \nimprove mainstreaming of inclusive growth into country partnership strategies,4 the ADO country \nchapters support the analysis of some key obstacles to inclusive economic growth: (i) factors \npreventing productive employment generation, (ii) human development constraints, (iii) gender \nand other socioeconomic barriers, (iv) spatial and geographical limitations, (v) institutional and \npolicy weaknesses, and (vi) factors preventing expansion of social protection programs.  \n \n3.  The Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 also recognized several evolving development \nchallenges for Asia and the Pacific, including safeguarding financial stability and addressing \npersistent gender disparities. The ADO and ADO Update theme chapters will tackle these two \nimportant topics. The tight link between financial stability and economic growth became painfully \nclear for a group of East and Southeast Asian countries during the Asian financial crisis of \n1997\u20131998 and for the world at large in the wake of the 2008\u20132009 global financial crisis (GFC). \nMore generally, financial instability can culminate in financial crisis, which inevitably has adverse \nramifications  for  growth,  sometimes  even  long-term  growth.  Since  the  GFC,  the  external \nfinancial environment has become more volatile due to the financial instability of the advanced \neconomies. In addition to such external vulnerabilities, developing Asia also faces a number of \ninternal vulnerabilities, such as the growing importance of less-regulated nonbank financing. 5 \nSound and efficient financial regulation is the first line of defense against the region\u2019s internal \nand external financial vulnerabilities. Recent financial instability of advanced economies has \nstrengthened the case for intra-regional financial integration and cooperation. Well-developed \nbond markets and better financial intermediation for the household sector will help too. \n \n4.  Gender  inequality  undermines  the  prospects  for  social  progress  and  economic \ndevelopment. The region has seen rapid changes in its social, economic, and demographic \n                                                \n1  ADO 2015 was identified as a corporate priority TA project as submitted to the office of the vice-president for \nknowledge management and sustainable development in February 2014. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 12 June 2014. \n3  ADB. 2014. Midterm Review of Strategy 2020: Meeting the Challenges of a Transforming Asia and Pacific. Manila. \n4  ADB. 2013. Guidelines on Inclusive Economic Growth in Country Partnership Strategy. Manila. \n5  Developing Asia refers to the 45 developing members of ADB. \n ", "2   \nstructure over the past three decades, which offer both new opportunities and challenges to \nadvance gender equality. The most significant societal change is the rapid, but often poorly \nplanned urbanization in developing Asia\u2014about half the population is expected to live in urban \nareas by 2020. Although urbanization offers greater independence and opportunity for women, \nin many cities, women face higher risks of violence, constraints on employment, and access to \nbasic services, bearing disproportionately the brunt of growing urban poverty and increasing \npopulation density. \n \nIII.  THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n5.  The  impact  will  be  for  the  ADO  to  influence  the  environment  within  which  policy \nformulation occurs in selected DMCs. The outcome will be citations of the ADO by the media \nand by economic researchers, both within ADB and beyond.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n6.  The main outputs of the TA will be the disseminated ADO 2015, ADO 2015 Update, \nADO supplements,6 and edited research volumes. Appendix 4 contains the outline of ADO 2015 \nand ADO 2015 Update. The TA will support the following key activities: (i) preparing background \nanalytical  papers,  (ii)  further  developing  and  refining  analytical  methods,  (iii)  drafting  ADO \ncontent, (iv) editing economic content and manuscripts, (v) preparing and laying out materials \nfor publication, and (vi) disseminating key results and policy messages. In parallel, the TA will \nsupport initiatives to build capacity for macroeconomic modeling, and for generating growth \nprojections and monitoring markets. These initiatives will include economists in ADB\u2019s regional \ndepartments, especially those involved in preparing the country chapters, and possibly ADB\u2019s \nOffice of Regional Economic Integration. Some initial activities for the preparation of ADO 2016 \nmay also be supported under the TA. \n \n7.  The  analytical  rigor  and  policy  relevance  of  the  ADO  reports  should  be  constantly \nimproved if they are to remain a credible, independent source of knowledge and information \nabout Asia and the Pacific. To provide a solid empirical and analytical foundation for the content \nof  ADO,  the  TA  team  will  commission  background  research  papers  that  will  supplement \nresearch of the Macroeconomics and Finance Research Division (ERMF) on the selected theme \ntopics by analyzing issues and policy implications for developing Asia. These papers will be \nconsolidated  in  an  edited  research  volume  to  provide  researchers  with  a  more  extensive \nanalysis related to the theme topic. The research volume may be copublished with a reputable \npublishing house and will likely entail a buyback arrangement. \n \n8.  The theme chapter of ADO 2015 will explore the role of developing Asia's financial \nsystem in sustaining its growth, while also examining ways to make the system more inclusive \nand stable. The region\u2019s growth has moderated visibly since the GFC of 2008\u20132009. At the \nsame time, the region is in the midst of a structural transition toward a new growth paradigm in \nwhich productivity growth will play a larger role. The region\u2019s finance sector will thus have to \ndevelop in a way that supports growth by boosting both investment and productivity. A financial \nsystem that efficiently allocates capital to its most productive use is a vital ingredient of the new \ngrowth paradigm. To make growth more inclusive, the region\u2019s policy makers will be challenged \n                                                \n6  The ADO Supplement is a short report prepared by the Regional Economic Outlook Task Force to provide \nquarterly updates of macro forecasts between ADO and ADO Update releases.  \n ", "  3 \nto find ways to extend access to finance to the poor, and small and medium-sized enterprises. \nIn addition, developing Asian countries must strengthen financial stability, for example through \nbetter regulation, so that the finance sector does not itself become a source of growth-harming \nvolatility. Overall, this theme chapter will provide policy advice on how the region can foster \nstable financial systems that can support efficient and inclusive growth in the post-GFC world. \n \n9.  The ADO 2015 Update theme will explore women\u2019s role in developing Asia\u2019s economic \nprogress. Social norms, cultural practices, and policy constraints have held back women in the \nregion from realizing their full potential, which undermines the region\u2019s sustainable growth and \nlong-term prosperity. In advanced countries, although female labor force participation steadily \nincreased  over  the  20th  century,  it  still  remains  below  men\u2019s  participation,  particularly  for \nmarried  women.  Developing  Asia  is  no  different. While  gender  issues  vary  widely  across \ndeveloping  countries,  some  common  patterns  emerge.  These  include  unequal  access  to \neducation, health services, and social protection; lower wages and poor-quality jobs; limited \nproperty  rights  and  lack  of  financial  inclusion;  restricted  economic  mobility;  and  other \ndiscrimination and restraints that hinder women\u2019s economic and political participation at par with \nmen. The theme will consider various gender issues afflicting DMCs and analyze their causes \nand socioeconomic\u2013environmental consequences. It will determine forgone economic benefits \ndue to gender disparities and examine public policies that address these issues. \n \n10.  The TA will also support the development and refinement of analytical methods to \nsupplement ADB\u2019s short- and medium-term country economic monitoring and reporting. This will \nstrengthen the economic underpinnings of country programs and strategies for the DMCs, \nthereby making economic policies better informed and designed, and enhancing ADB\u2019s country \nassistance. As part of the ADO preparation to strengthen the content, the TA team will organize \nconferences and workshops. The writers\u2019 workshop, which will be co-organized with the Human \nResource Policy and Programs Division, will focus on macroeconomic analysis of current issues, \ngrowth accounting, economic projections and macroeconomic modeling, and effective writing \nskills.  The  workshop  will  target  selected  economists  and  national  staff  in  ADB\u2019s  regional \ndepartments and resident missions that are responsible for writing the country chapters. The \nconferences will focus on the reports\u2019 theme chapters. Distinguished economists in the region \nwill be invited to discuss initial drafts of the background papers to improve the analytical rigor \nand policy relevance of the theme chapters. \n \n11.  To ensure accuracy, coherence, and consistency in approach across the ADO and the \nedited volume of background research papers, international consultants will provide high-quality \nediting services. \n \n12.  The publications will be widely disseminated in collaboration with ADB\u2019s Department of \nExternal Relations (DER) and participating resident missions. The international launch will be \nfollowed by presentations cohosted by ADB development partners within and outside Asia and \nthe  Pacific.  Outreach  will  include  analytical  discussions  of  the  issues  in  partnership  with \nacademic institutions and think tanks. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,200,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The cost estimates and financing plan are \nin Appendix 2. \n \n ", "4   \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  ADB, through its Economics and Research Department (ERD), will be the executing \nagency of the TA, responsible for implementing and monitoring the TA, including consultant \nrecruitment and procurement, and administration of the workshops. Given the high institutional \nprofile  of  the  ADO,  the  chief  economist  will  report  to  the  vice-president  for  knowledge \nmanagement  and  sustainable  development  and  to  the  President  at  critical  points  in  the \npublications\u2019 preparation. The TA is expected to start in July 2014 and be completed by 30 June \n2016. \n \n15.  The production of the ADO will be a joint effort of ERD economists (led by ERMF), \nfinance  sector  and  gender  experts  within  ADB,  country  economists  of  ADB\u2019s  regional \ndepartments and resident missions, national experts, international consultants, and economics \neditorial  advisors.  Adopting  the  \u201cOne  ADB\u201d  approach  in  knowledge  solutions,  ERMF  will \ncontinue to collaborate with regional departments and resident missions in preparing the country \nchapters. In the preparation of the ADO 2015 theme chapter on financial development, ERD will \nwork closely with the finance sector and development communities of practice, and will seek \ncollaboration with ADB\u2019s Office of Regional Economic Integration and the Asian Development \nBank Institute. As such, the theme chapter will benefit greatly from ADB\u2019s stock of knowledge, \nfor example on Asian bond market development, while its output will in turn help inform and \nguide ADB\u2019s finance sector operations. ERD will seek to collaborate with a reputable center of \nexcellence during TA implementation. For the theme chapter on women\u2019s role in developing \nAsia\u2019s economic progress, ERD will coordinate with the Regional and Sustainable Development \nDepartment\u2019s gender team, relevant sector divisions, and the community of practice on gender \nequity to capture and avoid duplication of the vast material and knowledge that exists on this \ntopic.  Moreover,  the  TA  will  build  on  the  partnership  established  by  the  previous  TA  for \nEconomic  Analysis  for  Gender  and  Development  with  a  research  team  from  centers  of \nexcellence such as the Korea University and the Harvard Kennedy School. 7 \n \n16.  ADB will engage a consulting firm through consultants\u2019 qualification selection to work \nwith ADB staff and other consultants on research papers for the theme chapter of ADO 2015. \nThe firm will help determine the strategic direction and technical scope of the research papers, \noversee  the  timely  delivery  of  the  research  papers,  and  ensure  that  they  are  widely \ndisseminated. A total of 12 person-months of international consulting services will be required \nfrom the selected firm, comprising 4 person-months for one lead economist and 8 person-\nmonths for four senior economists. \n \n17.  Additional consultants will be engaged as individuals.8 The TA will require 15 person-\nmonths of international consultancy for economists and gender specialists who will prepare \nsupplementary background papers on the other major elements of finance sector development \nto be covered by the ADO 2015 theme chapter; and provide analyses on gender issues for the \nADO 2015 Update theme. Also, 26 person-months of international economic advisory and \nediting  consultants\u2019  time  will  be  required  for  the  economic  and  technical  editing  of  ADO \nmanuscripts  before  the  final  publication  of  ADO  2015,  ADO  2015  Update,  and  ADO \nsupplements. The TA will also require 10 person-months of national economic consultants\u2019 time \nto assist in conducting research on macroeconomic topics, and another 6 person-months will be \nneeded for the desktop publishing and graphic design requirements of the publication.

Manila. \n8 The TA will involve independent studies and require the rapid mobilization of consultants to ensure that there are no \ndelays in the publications\u2019 tight production schedules. In addition, the experience and qualifications of the individual \nconsultants will be the primary considerations. Thus, the consultants will be hired on an individual basis. \n ", "  5 \npersons  will  be  engaged  for  a  maximum  of  10  working  days  to  conduct  training  on \nmacroeconomics and economic forecasting and may also serve as discussants during the \nworkshops.  Consultants  and  resource  persons  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The outline terms \nof reference for consultants and resource persons are in Appendix 3. \n \n18.  The  TA  will  finance  procurement  of  information  and  knowledge  services  such  as \nsubscription to macroeconomic data providers as may be required to inform relevant and up-to-\ndate content.  Disbursements  will  be  done  in accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). Information and knowledge \nservices will be procured in accordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended \nfrom time to time). \n \n19.  Workshops will be conducted to review and discuss the initial country chapters and \nbackground papers prepared for the ADO. They are tentatively scheduled for December 2014, \nFebruary 2015, May 2015, and July 2015 at ADB headquarters. The TA may cover travel \nexpenses of selected resident mission staff participating in the workshops as resource persons. \n \n20.  The major results and key policy messages emerging from ADO 2015 and ADO 2015 \nUpdate will be disseminated to DMC policy makers, academic communities, and media. ERD, in \ncoordination with DER, will organize the main launch and subsequent roadshows, while resident \nmissions  in selected  DMCs,  in  coordination  with their  regional  departments  and  DER,  will \nconduct separate launches. The TA team will also hold roundtable discussions and workshops \nin different academic and economic institutions to reach a wider audience, and support the \ndissemination activities of ERD and DER. Both ADO 2015 and ADO 2015 Update will be \nfeatured on the ADB website, and copies, either in print or in USB cards, will be distributed \nworldwide. ADO supplements will be produced in between the publication of the ADO and the \nADO Update to provide updated assessment on the DMCs. This report will also be available in \nthe ADB website. The TA may also support the translation of the ADO into other languages, as \nmay  be  required,  to  support  dissemination  in  selected  DMCs.  This  will  be  arranged  in \ncoordination with resident missions, representative offices, and DER. \n \n21.  The assistant chief economist (ACE) of ERMF, as the overall team leader, will monitor \nthe work under the TA to ensure its effective implementation. ERD researchers will review the \nwork of consultants engaged to verify that tasks are completed in accordance with the terms of \nreference and that draft reports are delivered on time, with the ACE, ERMF managing the \ncombined outputs of the consultants. The ACE, ERMF will set the production schedule, ensure \nadequate  staffing,  and be  responsible for meeting  the  deadlines for the  timely  delivery  of \npublications.  \n \n22.  The outcome and outputs will be evaluated to measure the success of the TA. ERMF \nevaluation  of  the  overall  ADO  process  will  be  conducted  to  determine  strengths  and \nweaknesses as well as areas for improvement that will serve as inputs for the next ADO. \nMonitoring and back-to-office reports on the ADO and ADO Update launches will also be \nreviewed to gather feedback on the publications and learn lessons from them. \n \nIV.
