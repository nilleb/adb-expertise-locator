The project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) is needed for conducting technical, \neconomic, financial, governance, safeguards, gender and social due diligence for the ensuing \nproject. It will apply recommendations from capacity development technical assistance (CDTA) \n7890 for mainstreaming climate resilience into preliminary designs, as well as inform and guide \ndetailed engineering consultants recruited under the project design advance (PDA). The CDTA, \nPPTA, and PDA schedules are synchronized to maximize knowledge transfer.   \n \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n2.  The key outputs are an agreed project design and feasibility study for the ensuing \nproject that satisfies the requirements of ADB and the government. The PPTA will enhance \nproject  readiness  by  assisting  the  government  in  undertaking  advance  actions,  including \nidentification of lands for project facilities.

Consulting Services \n4.  The TA will require about 82 person-months of consulting services (26 international and \n56  national).  Consulting  services  for  this  assignment  will  be  engaged  by  an  international \nconsulting firm in association with national consulting firm(s) for a total of 67 person-months of \nconsulting  services  (20  international  and  47  national).  ADB  will  recruit  an  additional  six \nconsultants  on  an  individual  basis  for  a total  of  15  person months  (6  international  and  9 \nnational). A team of consultants will be recruited under one package using the quality- and cost-", "based method of selection with a standard quality-cost ratio of 90:10.1 All consultants, including \nthe firm and individuals, will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time). A simplified technical proposal will be used \nfor the selection of a firm. The individual consultants will be engaged to undertake safeguards \ndue diligence, provide technical inputs, and enhance project readiness (Table A4.3).  \n \nTable A4.3: Summary of Consulting Services Requirement  \nPositions  Person-Months \nRequired \nInternational   \nWater Supply and Sanitation Specialist (Team Leader )  7.0 \nClimate Change Adaptation Specialist  3.0 \nDrainage and Flood Control Engineer  3.0 \nUrban Planning Specialist  2.0 \nMunicipal Infrastructure Specialist  2.0 \nProject Economist & Financial Specialist  2.0 \nProcurement Specialist  1.0 \nGroundwater Specialist (individual)  2.0 \nEnvironmental Safeguard Specialist (individual )  2.0 \nSocial Safeguard Expert (individual)  2.0 \nNational   \nWater Supply and Sanitation Engineer (Deputy Team Leader)  8.0 \nClimate Change Adaptation Expert   4.0 \nDrainage and Flood Control Engineer  5.0 \nMunicipal Infrastructure Expert  4.0 \nHydrogeologist  4.0 \nUrban Planning Expert  3.0 \nInstitutional and Governance Expert  3.0 \nProject Economist & Financial Expert  4.0 \nEnvironmental Safeguard Expert  4.0 \nSocial Safeguard Expert  4.0 \nSocial, Gender, and Community Participation Expert   4.0 \nProject Management Expert (individual )  3.0 \nDevelopment Project Proforma Expert (individual)  3.0 \nProcurement Expert (individual)  3.0 \n    Source: ADB estimates. \n \n5.  The outline terms of reference for the project preparatory TA consultants are described \nbelow.  During a period of 8 months, the PPTA will formulate the design of the project to be \nmutually agreed upon between the government and ADB. The TA will adequately address the \nfollowing aspects relating to the ensuing loan project: (i) the rationale for selecting project towns \nand  confirmation  of  priority  subprojects  in  each  municipality;  (ii)  assessment  of  technical, \nprocurement, and management capacity of the executing agency, project towns and other key \nagencies involved in the project; (iii) financial assessment of the project towns, including their \nfinancial  projections,  and  proposals  for  sustainable  operation  and  maintenance  of  project \nfacilities; (iv) formulation of appropriate financial and institutional arrangements; (v) preparation \nof feasibility study of selected projects, including preliminary engineering designs and financial \nand economic analyses, which incorporates considerations of climate change adaptation;2 (vi) \n                                                \n1  The 90:10 quality:cost ratio is justified as the PPTA will pilot a new approach in creating climate resilient urban \ninfrastructure. Given the complex technical assessments required including the quantification of costs and benefits \nof climate change, and applying the results of climate modeling to preliminary designs, it will be critical to mobilize  \n    the most technically qualified team of specialists to ensure effective demonstration in the ensuing project and \nfuture ADB investments. \n2  Assessment of climate change adaptations and recommendations for the project towns will be initiated by the \nconsultants engaged under the ongoing capacity development technical assistance (ADB CDTA 7890). ", "social, gender, and poverty analysis; (vii) preparation of a consultation and participation plan; \n(viii) preparation of required safeguard documents; (ix) assessment of governance risks in the \nareas of financial management, procurement, and corruption, and development of risk mitigation \nmeasures based on the assessment for minimizing procurement and financial management \nrisks; (x) assess and review status of any town plans (land use, drainage, etc.) and investment \nproposals in light of better medium- to long-term urban planning and enforcement of necessary \nland use and building regulations and bylaws, and development of recommendations to improve \nthese plans incorporating climate change considerations; (xi) proposed loan procurement plan \nfor goods, works, and services, with suggested level of prior or, if applicable, post review based \non  executing  agency  and  implementing  agency  capacity  assessment;  (xii)  assistance  in \npreparation  of  government  development  project  proforma  (DPP);  and  (xii)  proposal  of \nimplementation  schedule,  detailed  cost  estimates  and  financing  plan,  as  well  as  required \nconsultant inputs under the project with proposed sequencing of consultant recruitment and \nprocurement bidding and awarding. \n \n6.  Consultants will also provide support to enhance project readiness and expedite project \nstart-up by: (i) undertaking training of relevant officials involved in the project, (ii) assisting the \nexecuting agency and project municipalities in undertaking advance contracting, mainly for \nrecruitment of consultants for the project, and in (iii) undertaking other necessary actions such \nas land acquisition in accordance with the agreed resettlement plans. Consultants will prepare \nnecessary documents required for project processing and implementation acceptable to ADB.  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n7.  The  executing  agency  is  LGED  of  the  Ministry  of  Local  Government,  Rural \nDevelopment  and  Cooperatives.  A  steering  committee,  chaired  by  the  Secretary,  Local \nGovernment Division, will provide overall policy guidance for the PPTA.3 The government will \nprovide: (i) all relevant documents, data, statistics, information, and maps that are available at \nthe disposal of the government; (ii) qualified counterpart staff, including their field per diem and \nfield transportation; (iii) a TA director from LGED, to be assigned before the mobilization of the \nconsultants; (iv) office accommodation and office equipment, including desks, chairs, and local \ncommunication; and (v) logistical assistance for the workshops and seminars, including venue \nprovision and identifying and sending invites to participants. The equipment procured under the \nTA will be turned over to LGED at the end of the TA. A suitably staffed project management unit \n(PMU) will be established by LGED at its headquarters in Dhaka.  All disbursements under the \nTA shall be made in accordance with the TA Disbursement Handbook (May 2010, as amended \nfrom time to time). The proposed TA processing and implementation schedule is listed in Table \nA4.4. The estimated start and completion dates of the TA are August 2012 to August 2013.  \n \n   \n                                                \n3 Steering Committee membership will include LGED, Department of Public Health Engineering, Ministry of \nEnvironment and Forests (Climate Change Unit), representatives of project towns, Urban Development Directorate, \nDisaster Management Bureau, Bangladesh Water Development Board, Economic Relations Division and Finance \nDivision of the Ministry of Finance, and Planning Commission.
