Tourism has been included as the 11th Flagship program under the Greater Mekong \nSubregion (GMS) program strategic framework approved by the GMS governments in November \n2002. A tourism sector working group (TWG) comprising senior representatives of the national \ntourism organizations (NTOs) was established in 1993 to guide the implementation of projects to \npromote the GMS as a unique tourism destination. The TWG is supported by the United Nations \nEconomic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP), the Pacific Asia Travel \nAssociation (PATA), the United Nations Education Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), \nthe World Tourism Organization (WTO), and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The Agency for \nCoordinating  Mekong  Tourism  Activities  (AMTA)  was  established  in  1997  in  Bangkok  as  a \npermanent secretariat of the TWG. This regional technical assistance (TA)1 is included in the GMS \nRegional Cooperation Strategy and Program for 2004. On the basis of initial discussions with \nstakeholders, the TA Fact-Finding Mission prepared an outline of the TA, which was discussed at \nthe 15th TWG meeting in Chiang Mai, Thailand, on 26 March 2004. Participants at the meeting \nrequested TA to prepare a GMS tourism sector strategy and action plan (TSS&AP) and endorsed \nthe concept, objectives, and components of the TA. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.   GMS  leaders  have  recognized  that  a  subregional  approach  to  sustainable  tourism \ndevelopment is necessary to promote the subregion as a single destination and increase its \nattractiveness. The TWG, which has promoted several successful subregional projects in the last \n10 years,2 has also recognized that there is need for a more holistic approach based on focused \nprograms  to  continue  the  sustainable  expansion  of  the  sector,  while  protecting  the  natural, \nhistorical, and cultural heritage. It is also necessary to develop policies and mechanisms to ensure \nthat the economic impact of tourism is fairly distributed and significantly reduce poverty. Greater \ncoordination and more focused strategies to promote the sustainable development of the tourism \nsector  will  enhance  economic  opportunities,  increase  tax  revenues  and  foreign  exchange \nrevenues, create direct and indirect employment opportunities, and reduce poverty across the \nsubregion.  Many  private  sector  operators  in  the  tourism  industry  are  already  implementing \nsubregional strategies when approaching the GMS tourism market. Nongovernment organizations \n(NGOs) and local communities in the GMS also recognize the need to strengthen subregional \ncooperation and strategies to ensure the protection of natural and cultural resources and mitigate \npotential negative effects of unguided tourism development on vulnerable local populations. A \nGMS TSS&AP is necessary to provide a subregional vision for the sector and prioritize objectives, \nprograms, and projects. The strategy will include comprehensive programs with concrete projects \nfor each program. The TA will build on previous subregional TAs and projects in the tourism sector \nin the GMS.3  \n \n3.  The GMS countries4 possess a wide range of highly attractive and relatively undeveloped \nnatural,  cultural,  and  historical  heritage  tourism  resources.  In  2003,  GMS  tourism  resources \nattracted about 17 million international tourists and around $10 billion in receipts. Estimates based \non the WTO 2020 Vision forecasts indicate that if a subregional approach to develop and promote \nthe tourism sector is adopted, the GMS countries could attract about 29.2 million international \n                                                 \n1   The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 10 February 2004. \n2  Samples of this success are the Mekong Tourism Forum, which has become a key meeting in the annual tourism \nagenda in the subregion; and the project Jewels of the Mekong, which substantially contributed to attract tourists to the \nsubregion as a single destination.   \n3  ADB. 1997. Technical Assistance to the Greater Mekong Subregion for the Mekong-Lancang River Tourism Planning \nStudy. Manila; and ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board Directors on a Proposed \nLoan to the Greater Mekong Subregion for the Mekong Tourism Development Project. Manila. \n4  Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, People\u2019s Republic of China (Yunnan Province), Thailand, \nand Viet Nam \n ", "2       \ntourists by 2010 and about 61.3 million by 2020. If the forecast is realized, by 2010 there could be \nan additional $7.56 billion expenditure; an additional 194,000 hotel rooms and related services and \nfacilities with investment requirements of about $14.5 billion; a substantial increase in the demand \nfor and supply of transportation equipment and services; and about 194,000 new jobs in the hotel \nsector. The contribution to household incomes can be significant, especially in the rural areas with \ntourism  potential  and  among  disadvantaged  groups  such  as  the  youth,  women,  and  ethnic \nminorities, who will be able to get better paying jobs, or new jobs, or create their own small \nbusiness. The volume of taxes accruing to national and local governments in the GMS will also \nincrease and boost local economies and overall trade activity. However, these benefits will not \noccur, or may not be equitably distributed unless a subregional TSS&AP is adopted. \n \n4.  To deal with the challenges ahead, the TWG recently renovated its agenda and the tourism \nflagship matrix to approach the sector in a holistic way. The TWG reorganized its activities around \nthematic programs, instead of the previous project-based approach. The programs include (i) \npromoting  the  subregion  as  a  single  tourism  destination;  (ii)  developing  tourism-related \ninfrastructure; (iii) improving human resources in the tourism sector; (iv) improving standards for \nmanaging natural, historical, and cultural resources for conservation and tourism; (v) promoting \npro-poor community-based tourism; (vi) promoting greater participation of the private sector and \npartnerships with the public sector; and (vii) facilitating the movement of tourists to and within the \nGMS. The TSS&AP will be based on this new approach and thematic programs of the TWG. It will \ninclude strategic guidelines and action plans for each thematic area. \n \n5.  The common need for effective destination marketing is one of the strongest reasons for \ncooperation among the NTOs of the GMS. Joint-destination marketing activities organized by \nAMTA under the umbrella of the TWG have been effective. However, several problems remain \u2013 \nlack of a general direction and coordination of activities, insufficient financing, and lack of human \nresources in AMTA and other relevant stakeholders to  implement the activities. A coherent and \nfocused GMS tourism positioning and marketing strategy is a key requirement in developing the \nsubregion as a single destination. The strategy should cover (i) identification of the appropriate \ntype, range, and location of products including tour circuits based on the priority areas that should \nbe  developed;  (ii)  a  target  market  segmentation  strategy  and  the  forecast  tourism  volumes \nbetween 2006 and 2015 broken down by product and activity interest, by source markets, and by \nsocioeconomic profile; (iii) a brand image and market positioning strategy that individual GMS \ncountries will use as a marketing umbrella for their own individual activities and to organize \nmarketing and promotional activities at the subregional level; (iv) a plan for establishing and \nfinancing an appropriate institutional structure to implement subregional marketing activities; and \n(v) the respective roles of the public and private sectors.    \n \n6.  Under the leadership of the TWG, NTOs of the GMS are cooperating in joint projects to \nplan  and  develop  tourism-related  infrastructure.  Six  NTOs  agreed  on  conceptual  plans  for \ndeveloping tourism infrastructure on the Mekong River. ADB supported this initiative through the \nGMS Mekong Tourism Development Project, approved in December 2002. However, to ensure the \ndevelopment of appropriate tourism-related infrastructure, it is necessary to prepare an overall \nstrategy  for  the  subregion  that  identifies  (i)  priority  geographic  areas  where  tourism-related \ninfrastructure is required (with special attention to economic corridors and development triangles \nincluding  several  countries);  (ii)  priority  tourism-related  infrastructure  subsectors  that  require \nimprovement; (iii) financial mechanisms to develop and operate tourism-related infrastructure; \n(iv) institutional arrangements required to coordinate tourism-related infrastructure development at \nnational and subregional levels; and (v) a list of high-priority tourism-related infrastructure projects, \ndescription of its profile, and prefeasibility.  \n \n7.  The TWG has supported human resource development (HRD) for more than a decade. A \nkey emphasis has been on upgrading the skills of the GMS trainers in the basic craft skills of the \ntourism industry, and training courses for NTO\u2019s personnel on issues relevant to GMS tourism ", "        3   \ndevelopment. UNESCAP has been a major supporter of these initiatives. However, there has been \nlack  of  coordination  in  identifying  priorities  and  organizing  activities  supported  by  various \nstakeholders. It is necessary to develop a comprehensive subregional approach to tourism HRD \ncovering both private and public sectors at national, provincial, and local tourism offices, and \nnatural and cultural heritage resource managers.  \n \n8.  National parks, other protected areas, historic places and cultural sites, together with the \npeople living within and adjacent to these areas, are the primary resources of the tourism industry. \nThe ability to manage these resources wisely will largely determine whether growth in tourism is \nsustainable. Since 1995, the TWG has sought opportunities to improve standards of natural and \ncultural  resource  management  in  the  GMS.  UNESCO  has  been  a  major  advocate  of  these \ninitiatives. However, a common approach in the GMS to manage these resources to ensure an \nappropriate balance between conservation objectives and poverty reduction through improved \ntourism is still lacking. A subregional approach to the sustainable management and development of \nnatural and cultural heritage resources linked to tourism is necessary. Special attention must be \ngiven to increasing the level of cooperation and coordination between the NTOs and the resource \nmanagement agencies responsible for the natural and cultural heritage, and between those and \nlocal communities. \n \n9.  Tourism policies and regulations that are pro-poor and which lead to genuine social, \neconomic, cultural and environmental benefits should be promoted by private and public sectors in \nthe  GMS.  In  the  past,  certain  policies  and  projects  set  tourism  off  on  an  anti-poor  course \ncharacterized by uneven distribution of benefits, poor planning, economic leakages, environmental \ndestruction, unguided development, and lack of concern with the local population\u2019s needs and \ncultures. To improve the sustainability and poverty reduction impact of the GMS tourism sector, it is \nnecessary to focus attention on expanding business and job opportunities for the poor, retaining \nand  distributing  benefits  at  the  local  level,  promoting  local  products,  ensuring  sustainable \ndevelopment of tourism infrastructure at the community level, promoting partnerships between \npublic and private sectors and local communities, and expanding local participation in planning and \nmanaging  tourism  destinations.  The  TWG  included  support  for  village-based  tourism  into  its \nagenda in 1995 and UNESCO has been an advocate of this project. However, GMS governments \ndo not yet have a common approach to pro-poor tourism. It is necessary to prepare a subregional \napproach  to  achieving  a  more  pro-poor  and  equitable  distribution  of  the  benefits  of  tourism \ndevelopment and to develop community-based and ecotourism projects that benefit the poor, \nwomen,  and  indigenous  people  in  the  subregion.  The  strategy  will  be  based  on  an  in-depth \nanalysis of the causes that keep the poor from benefiting from tourism. \n \n10.  The TWG has established the Mekong Tourism Forum (MTF) as a vehicle to encourage \nprivate sector participation in GMS tourism and promote dialogue between private and public \nsectors in the GMS. PATA has supported the organization of nine MTFs. However, a coherent \nsubregional approach to increase private sector participation in tourism still needs to be developed. \nIt is necessary to prepare a strategy to (i) increase cooperation and develop partnerships between \nthe private and public sectors at local, national, and subregional levels; (ii) increase private sector \ninvestment  in  the  tourism  sector;  (iii)  facilitate  the  development  of  small  and  medium-sized \nenterprises  (SMEs)  in  the  tourism  sector;  and  (iv)  assess  measures  to  increase  industry \ncompetitiveness. \n \n11.  Easing restrictions on cross-border travel within GMS has been a priority of the TWG. To \ndate, outcomes have been significant. It is, however, necessary to develop a comprehensive road \nmap to facilitate the movement of tourists to and within the subregion, while minimizing the \npotential negative effects, such as increased illegal criminal activities, trafficking in people, and \nHIV-AIDS. The road map should cover:  (i) facilitation of cross-border movement and improved \nprocessing procedures at border checkpoints, (ii) development of overland and river-based tours \n ", "4       \nand tour circuits, (iii) provision of improved transportation services information, and (iv) liberalizing \nair transport policies. \n \n12.  Governments need to continue developing standards, plans, and regulations for pro-poor \ntourism interventions, and strengthening institutional frameworks and standards for monitoring \nimpact in a coordinated way. A strategy and flexible institutional mechanisms are also necessary to \nenhance  cooperation  and  coordination  among  the  GMS  governments  in  developing  policies, \nregulations, plans, standards, and monitoring mechanisms.  \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n13.  The TA will contribute to the goal of increased tourism cooperation in the GMS to promote \nthe development and sustainability of the tourism sector and to reduce poverty. The TA will assist \nthe GMS countries to prepare a 10-year subregional strategy and a 5-year action plan for a \nsustainable tourism sector, and to provide a framework for the development and implementation of \nthe  GMS  tourism  flagship  program.  The  strategy  will  have  a  comprehensive  framework  of \nprograms for the period 2006\u20132015,  and  the  action  plan  will  include  a  detailed  schedule  of \nactivities and projects to be implemented during the first 5 years. The TA will also recommend ADB \ninterventions to support the TSS&AP. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n14.  The two main TA outputs are the 10-year strategy and the 5-year action plan. Secondary \noutputs are as follows: (i) a GMS positioning and marketing plan to promote the subregion as a \nsingle destination; (ii) identification and prioritization of infrastructure requirements and projects for \nsustainable tourism development in the GMS; (iii) assessment of human resources needs and \nconstraints  in  the  tourism  sector  and  preparation  of  a  strategy  to  develop  those  resources, \nincluding  a  program  for  joint  GMS  training  activities;  (iv)  a  GMS  approach  to  sustainable \nmanagement of the cultural and natural heritage for tourism development and identification of pilot \nprojects;  (v)  identification  of  constraints,  opportunities,  and  best  practices,  and  recommended \nmechanisms and pilot projects to increase the distribution of tourism benefits, minimize negative \nimpacts, and reduce poverty through ecotourism and community- and village-based projects; (vi) a \nstrategy to develop coordinated policies and regulations in the GMS to increase private sector \nparticipation and investment in the tourism sector, particularly from SMEs; (vii) a long-term road \nmap  and  action  plan  to  facilitate  the  movement  of  tourists  to  and  within  the  GMS;  (viii) \nrecommendations for the establishment of a regular and flexible  mechanism to coordinate national \nlaws, regulations, plans, and strategies for the tourism sector at the subregional level; and (ix) a \nGMS institutional framework for coordinating, financing and implementing the strategy, which \nreinforces  and  expands  the  powers  and  responsibilities  of  AMTA  and  the  GMS  TWG  and \nenhances NTOs\u2019 sense of ownership. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n15.  The TA will be in two parts: Part A will produce a 10-year tourism strategy, and part B will \nprepare a detailed 5-year action plan. The TA will include concept papers for priority tourism \nprojects and recommendations for ADB interventions to support the TSS&AP. Partnerships with \nbilateral and multilateral government and NGOs will be assessed.  \n \n16.  Following  a  participatory approach, the TA will consult with government departments, \ntourism  industry,  bilateral  and  international  funding  agencies,  local  communities,  NGOs,  and \nuniversities  in  the  GMS.  At  the  end  of  the  inception  period,  the  consultants  will  visit  each \nparticipating country, as necessary, to collect information, meet relevant stakeholders, and support ", "        5   \nthe NTO to organize national workshops to discuss the initial conclusions of the study. A draft GMS \ntourism sector strategy and preliminary ideas for an action plan will be presented at a regional \nworkshop to be organized in Bangkok by AMTA and the consultants in January 2005. A second \nround of discussions with national stakeholders during January-February 2005 will refine the \ncontents of the strategy, agree on a detailed action plan, and identify and prepare concept papers \nfor potential tourism projects. The refined strategy, action plan, and concept papers of priority \nprojects will be presented at a second regional workshop in Siem Reap, Cambodia at the end of \nMarch 2005 to coincide with the meeting of the 16th TWG. The final TSS&AP will be submitted to \nthe NTOs by the end of May 2005 and, after its approval by the chairpersons of the NTOs, will be \npresented to the GMS leaders for endorsement during the 2nd GMS Summit tentatively scheduled \nfor July 2005 in the PRC.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $800,000. It will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s TA funding program. Details of the costs estimates are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The TWG acts as a project steering committee for the TA. AMTA will be the Executing \nAgency for the TA with close collaboration from the NTOs. The NTOs will coordinate with other \ncentral and provincial government agencies to provide necessary support to the TA consultants, \nincluding access to information and potential project sites. Each NTO will appoint a TA coordinator, \nwho will be supported by two professional counterpart and support staff. To ensure full participation \nof the relevant ministries and coordinate inputs from the government agencies concerned, the \nappointed TA coordinators will invite senior staff of those agencies to the workshops and keep \nthem fully informed of the progress and results of the study. \n \n19.  The TA will be implemented over 9 months from October 2004 to June 2005. Consultants \nwill submit an inception report within 2 weeks of the start of the study, an interim report within 10 \nweeks, a draft final report within 21 weeks, and a final report 4 weeks after the governments and \nADB have commented on the draft final report.  \n \n20.  Consulting  services  will  be  undertaken  by  a  firm.  ADB  will  engage  a  combination  of \ndomestic and international consultants, using simplified technical proposals and the quality- and \ncost-based selection method, in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and \nother arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants.  The TA will require \napproximately  51  person-months  of  consulting  services:  21  person-months  of  international \nexpertise comprising tourism planning and strategic development (4.5), tourism marketing and \nproduct  development  (3),  tourism-related  infrastructure  (3),  pro-poor  tourism  (3),  natural  and \ncultural  resource  management  for  tourism  (3),  tourism  economics  (1.5),  human  resource \ndevelopment (3); and 30 person-months of domestic expertise (six tourism sector specialists, one \nfrom each participating country). Outline terms of reference are in Appendix 3. Expected project \noutputs will be widely disseminated after approval by the GMS governments. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 on a grant basis for the \nGreater Mekong Subregion Tourism Sector Strategy, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "6   Appendix 1     \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \n       \n  Performance  Monitoring Mechanisms  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Indicators/Targets    /Risks \n   \nGoal       \nIncreased tourism  Greater coordination and  Central and local government  Commitment of the GMS \ncooperation in the Greater  integration of tourism  tourism, social and poverty  stakeholders, especially the \nMekong Subregion (GMS)  activities in the GMS  statistics of GMS countries  national tourism organizations \nto promote the      (NTOs), is strong and \ndevelopment and  Increase by 44.3 million of  Studies or reports from  sustained.
