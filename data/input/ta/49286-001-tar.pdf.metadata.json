INTRODUCTION \n1.   The  2013  procurement  governance  review  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \naffirmed  the  critical  need  for  country  procurement  risk  assessments  in  order  to  identify \nimplementation  risks  and  mitigation  measures.  It  specifically  noted  that  every  country \npartnership  strategy  (CPS)  should  be  supported  by  a  country-specific  procurement  risk \nassessment  to  identify  major  risks  that  could  affect  project  implementation  and  therefore \ndevelopment effectiveness.1 The review found that ADB CPSs and country operations business \nplans rarely have updated country procurement risk assessments with time-bound action plans \nand resource allocations to minimize procurement-related risks. \n2.  In July 2014, the President approved the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 Action Plan.2. \nAs  part  of  the  Midterm  Review,  the  President  also  approved  the  10-point  action  plan  for \nprocurement and associated reforms. Action 1 of the plan requires that country and sector \nprocurement risk assessment be conducted as part of the CPS process, to set updated bidding \nthresholds and determine the level of procurement oversight. \n \n3.  Assessments  of  the  institutional  capacity  of  procurement-related  agencies  in  ADB\u2019s \ndeveloping member countries (DMCs) are an important input in determining the extent to which \ncountry systems for procurement could be adopted in ADB projects. However, ADB has not yet \nadopted a systematic approach using a clear methodology to assess national and sector-level \nprocurement risk, and to establish benchmarks to enable measurement of changes in DMC \nprocurement capability. \n \n4.  The proposed procurement risk assessment methodology, which was developed as part \nof the 10-point action plan, allows procurement risk to be identified, enables determination of \nwhether  a  DMC\u2019s  country  systems  are suitable for  procurement,  and  revises  procurement \nreview thresholds and the prior review requirement. The design and monitoring framework for \nthis technical assistance (TA) is in Appendix 1.3  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n5.  Experience from ADB-financed projects across DMCs shows that procurement is time \nconsuming and often delays project implementation.4 ADB carries out assessments of the \nprocurement capacity of procuring entities during project processing to identify risk areas and \nadopt  suitable  risk  mitigation  measures  during  project  implementation.  Risk  mitigation  is \nessential to ensure ADB financing is spent as intended and to safeguard ADB\u2019s reputation. \nHowever, these risk mitigation measures\u2014which include providing procurement consultants \nunder the project management or supervision contracts to develop the executing agency\u2019s \ncapacity\u2014do not aim to develop the long-term capacity of the procuring entity. This is evident \nfrom delays experienced in many projects that have project management support built into the \nproject  design.  The  underlying  causes  of  weak  procurement  and  implementation  capacity, \nwhether they are inherent in the procuring entity or in the environment where the procuring \nentity operates, are not clearly understood, and therefore not addressed. \n \n6.  The  quality  of  procurement  systems  varies  significantly  across  DMCs,  and  across \nsectors and agencies within each DMC. ADB has provided resources and TA in support of \n                                                           \n1  ADB. 2013. Procurement Governance Review. Manila.  \n2  ADB. 2014.

Annual Portfolio Performance Review 2011. Manila. \n ", "2 \nvarious  government  procurement  reform  programs,  with  the  aim  of  improving  project \nimplementation management capacity of executing agencies of ADB-funded projects. Several \nDMCs have implemented first-generation public procurement reforms through the enactment of \nprocurement  laws  and  the  establishment  of  relevant  national  institutions.  However,  the \nachievement of national-level policy and institutional reforms does not automatically result in \nmore effective procurement by line agencies. In addition, broader governance weaknesses \nresult in inefficient use of funds and delays in project implementation. This is evident from the \nprocurement  capacity  assessments  that  ADB  selectively  conducts  for  project  loans,  which \ngenerally reveal procurement capacity constraints, regardless of whether the executing and \nimplementing agencies have experience with ADB-financed projects. Hence, it is important to \nidentify strengths, risks, and bottlenecks that hamper the flow of national-level reforms down to \nthe executing and implementing agencies, so that implementation-level procurement practices \nare effective and contribute to achievement of development outcomes.  \n  \n7.  ADB\u2019s current procurement supervision practices call for either prior or post approval of   \nADB-financed contracts. The quality of this review, particularly for contracts of lower value, \nrarely results in ADB not granting formal approval of an executing agency procurement decision. \nThis  consumes  valuable  project  time.  It  is  expected  that  the  proposed  changes to  ADB\u2019s \nprocurement supervision practices under the 10-point action plan, of which this action 1 is a part \nof, would considerably reduce the number of transactions subject to ADB review, by letting \ncountries take greater ownership and accountability. It would also, as appropriate, pave the way \nfor adopting more risk-based approaches and simplify the type of review without compromising \nprocurement principles, and thereby reduce staff work load and time taken for approval of \ntransactions. Such measures will help ADB more effectively manage the increase in its lending \nresulting from the merger of the Ordinary Capital Resources and Asian Development Fund. \n  \n8.  The proposed TA will directly support the preparations of CPSs through more systematic \nand current sector-specific procurement risk assessments. It will highlight procurement-related \nrisk and institutional capacity gaps that can hamper the delivery of development results.   \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact of the proposed TA is a more effective and efficient procurement system in \nADB DMCs. \n \n10.  The outcome is an appropriate level of delegation of procurement activities to ADB \nDMCs. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The assessment commences with the selection of procuring entities in various sectors in \na DMC, in close cooperation with ADB regional departments. Assessments in a specific DMC \nwill  be  synchronized  with  the  formulation  of  that  DMC\u2019s  CPS.  Using  the  diagnostic  guide \ndeveloped by the Operations Services and Financial Management Department (OSFMD), an \ninitial  desk  review  of  procurement  laws,  regulations,  and  processes  in  the  DMC  will  be \nconducted. The desk review will also take into account any information available to ADB and \ncountry-specific  procurement  experience.  Subsequently,  a  field  review  of  procurement \nprocesses as they are practiced by key agencies in ADB\u2019s primary sectors of operation will be \nconducted. The review will be based on interviews, questionnaires, and a sample of selected \n ", "3 \n \nproject-level procurement transactions. Based on the findings, sector procurement risks will be \nidentified, leading to a determination of the thresholds for international and national competitive \nbidding, including prior and post review limits. Risk mitigation measures will also be proposed. A \nsummary will be prepared for each sector and included in the CPS. The thresholds and review \nlimits will determine the level of delegation with regards to procurement. There is a caveat that \nonly  limited  procurement  data  may  be  available  in  some  sectors,  to  make  a  reasonable \nprocurement risk assessment. Special assumptions may be needed in such cases. \n \n12.  The results will be used to set thresholds and review limits. A summary of the sector \nrisks and thresholds will be incorporated in ADB CPSs.  A comprehensive procurement risk \nassessment at the agency or project level that builds on the initial findings will be undertaken for \nselected projects, including DMC programs. The assessment will indicate whether or not the \nnational procurement procedures and institutions, and the capacity and performance of the \nexecuting  and  implementing  agencies  adequately  meet  the  procurement  principles  of \ncompetition, economy and efficiency, transparency, and fairness and equal opportunity.  The \nlessons from the TA will assist ADB in preparing a comprehensive and practical procurement \nrisk assessment methodology for the use of country procurement systems. The findings of the \nTA can also be used to develop the capacity of DMCs to monitor and evaluate procurement \nprocedures, performance, and outcomes, and determine if these are in line with action plans to \nmitigate procurement-related risks and strengthen capacity. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,500,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The detailed cost estimates \nand financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  ADB will be the executing agency. OSFMD will be responsible for all TA activities. The \nTA will be implemented from January 2016 to December 2018. The TA will be implemented in \nADB DMCs in a phased manner, and synchronized with the CPS preparation process. OSFMD \nwill work closely with the relevant regional departments, including the ADB governance thematic \ngroup. \n \n15.  From  the  experience gained  in  previous  pilot  procurement risk  assessment  studies \nconducted by OSFMD, the TA will require international consultants (an estimated 40 person-\nmonths) and national consultants (an estimated 100 person-months) with skills in procurement \nmanagement, change management, and capacity development. Individual terms of reference \n(TOR) are in Appendix 3.  ADB will recruit all consultants individually in accordance with its \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Individual \nconsultant  selection  is considered  appropriate  given  that  experience  specific to  a  DMC  is \nrequired. In parallel, OSFMD will explore if a suitable firm can undertake this risk assessment, \non a retainer basis in future, with an appropriately drafted TOR. \n \n16.  OSFMD  will  coordinate  with  ADB  regional  departments  in  implementing  the  TA, \nincluding by participating in meetings with various sector procurement agencies, assisting with \ngathering procurement-related data, and providing logistical support. \n \n ", "4 \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,500,000 on a grant basis \nfor  Conducting  Procurement  Risk  Assessment  for  Improved  Procurement  Outcomes,  and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "Appendix 1  5 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n \nImpact the Project is Aligned witha \nThe impact of the proposed TA is a more effective and efficient procurement system in ADB DMCs. \n       \n   Performance Indicators   \nwith  Data Sources and  \n      Results Chain  Targets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \n      Outcome       \nThe outcome is an  The sector thresholds for  ADB procurement risk   Sector agency \nappropriate level of  international and national  assessment reports for each  procurement capacity \ndelegation of  competitive bidding are  DMC  is reduced after \nprocurement activities  determined, including prior  conducting the risk \nto ADB DMCs.  and post review limits.  assessment. \n   \nOutputs       \nThe sector  Final DMC procurement  Executing and implementing  Limited \nprocurement risks in  risk reports providing  agency procurement data and  procurement data \neach DMC are  sector and/or agency and  contract monitoring records;  available at the \nidentified including  national risk assessments  ADB procurement data  sector agencies.  \nmitigation measures.   approved by OSFMD.   \n     \nThe procurement  Final DMC procurement   \nthresholds for  risk reports providing  \ninternational and  justification for revised \nnational competitive  thresholds and prior and \nbidding determined,  post review limits. \nincluding prior and     \npost review limits.     \n \nKey Activities with Milestones \n1.1  Select procuring entities in close cooperation with national public procurement agencies, regional \ndepartments, and resident missions, synchronizing with the development of the CPS for the DMC \n(January 2016 to May 2017). \n1.2  Recruit international and  national consultants (January 2016 to May 2017). \n1.3  Conduct initial desk review of procurement laws, regulations, and processes.

The country and sector or agency procurement risk assessment is intended to (i) identify \nrisks in national or sector systems and/or practices that could result in sub-optimal use of \nnational  and/or  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  resources,  either  through  leakage  or \ninefficiency; (ii) assess the severity of the risks; and (iii) develop a practical risk management \nplan to address (at a minimum) high or significant procurement risks at the country and sector \nlevel.  \n \n2.  Country and sector or agency procurement risk assessment will be conducted using the \nassessment tool developed for the purpose. \n \nA.  Procurement Specialists (International)  \n \n3.  Scope. The international procurement specialists will work closely with the national \nprocurement specialists (to be recruited through a separate contract) and ADB\u2019s procurement \nstaff  to  conduct  (i)  country  procurement  risk  assessments  in  specified  countries;  and  (ii) \nprocurement risk assessment in the various sectors relevant to the ADB portfolio (including \nenergy, transport, public finance, agriculture, health, natural resources, rural development, and \nurban sectors). Executing agencies in each sector will be identified in close consultation with \nresident missions and regional departments. These assessments will be conducted as part of \nthe preparation of ADB country partnership strategies (CPSs).  \n \n4.  Detailed  tasks  and  expected  output.  Each  assessment  will  be  conducted  in  two \nstages, first as a desk review and then through field work for in-depth sector and agency risk \nassessments. \n \n5.   The initial desk review will cover procurement laws, regulations, and processes, and will \n(i) provide the basis for developing the national competitive bidding (NCB) annex, or specify \nmodifications required to enable national procurement laws, regulations, and processes to be \nused for ADB procurement; and (ii) establish the procurement environment within which the \nvarious sectors and the agencies involved operate. Where available, country assessments \n(whether from ADB or other multilateral development institutions) will be validated or updated, \nprimarily through consultation with government counterparts, development partners, and other \nrelevant stakeholders using the assessment tools developed by ADB.  \n \n6.  The desk review will be followed by an in-depth field survey and review to assess sector \nor  agency  procurement  performance;  the  field  surveys  will  be  conducted  primarily  by  the \nnational  procurement  specialists,  although  the  international  procurement  specialists  will \nparticipate in selected field surveys. Field interviews of government counterparts, development \npartners, and relevant stakeholders will be conducted, supported by an assessment of a sample \nof specific procurement transactions.  \n \n7.  The specialists will undertake the following: \n(i)  at the sector or agency level, assess strengths and weaknesses in procurement \nsystems  and  practices  from  the  perspective  of  the  legal  and  regulatory \nframework,  the  institutional  framework  and  management  capacity,  the \nprocurement operations and market practices, and integrity and transparency of \nthe public procurement systems; \n(ii)  identify and evaluate procurement risks at the sector or agency level, taking into \naccount any ongoing risk assessment initiatives of resident missions; \n ", "  Appendix 3  9 \n(iii)  assess e-procurement progress in the country, benefits achieved, and future \nroad map and performance constraints, if any; \n(iv)  propose risk mitigation and management strategies and/or activities in line with \nall of the above;  \n(v)  on the basis of the risk level assessments, propose sector-specific procurement \nsupervision thresholds, where applicable; and \n(vi)  on the basis of the assessment of market practices in response to sector or \nagency procurement operations, propose procurement method thresholds, i.e., \nthe types and sizes of contracts for which ADB international competitive bidding \nprocedures shall be applied. \n \n8.   The specialists shall produce the following outputs: \n(i)  for the in-depth sector and/or agency assessments: \n(a)  develop the program for field review and consultations with government \ncounterparts, development partners, and relevant stakeholders; \n(b)  prepare  a  procurement  assessment  plan  for  a  sample  of  specific \nprocurement transactions of identified sector agencies; \n(c)  prepare  a  narrative  description  of  the  sector  or  agency  procurement \nsystems, including identification of strengths and weaknesses; \n \n(ii)   on the basis of the procurement risk assessments undertaken:  \n(a)   identify and assess sector and/or agency risks, on the basis of degree of \nimpact and likelihood of occurrence;1 \n(b)  propose  risk  mitigation  and/or  management  strategies  to  address \nidentified risks, on the basis of the risk assessment;2  \n(c)  determine sector or agency procurement risk rating; \n(d)   propose  or  confirm  existing  sector  or  agency  procurement  method \nthresholds,  whether  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB),  NCB  or \nshopping;  \n(e)   propose sector or agency procurement supervision thresholds in terms of \nprior review limits; \n(f)   propose changes, if necessary, to the NCB annex; \n(g)   summarize findings in the country and sector or agency procurement risk \nassessment report (sample summaries will be provided by ADB); and \n(h)   prepare inputs to the country partnership strategy (including mitigation \nmeasures). \n \n9.

Duration  of the  assignment.  Each  consultant for  a  particular  DMC  will  provide  2 \nperson-months of inputs over a period of 4 to 5 months. \n  \n11.   Key deliverables. The consultant will summarize their sector or agency risk assessment \nfindings in the country and sector or agency procurement risk assessment report, and provide \ninputs  to  the  CPS  report,  including  the  risk  mitigation  and  management  strategies  and/or \nactivities. \n \nB.   Procurement Specialists (National) \n \n12.   Scope  of  work.  Two  national  procurement  specialists  will  work  closely  with  an \ninternational procurement specialist to conduct (i) country procurement risk assessments in the \nspecified countries, and (ii) procurement risk assessment in the specified sectors. Executing \nagencies under each sector will be identified in close consultation with regional departments \nand resident missions. These assessments will be conducted as part of CPS preparation.  \n \n13.  The  risk  assessment  report  will  recommend  country  and,  where  applicable,  sector-\nspecific procurement supervision thresholds, and will also confirm or recommend modification of \nthe procurement method or ICB threshold on the basis of contractor and/or supplier market \nassessments. \n \n14.  Detailed tasks and/or expected output. Each assessment will be conducted in two \nstages, first as a desk review and then through field work for in-depth sector and agency risk \nassessments. \n \n15.  The  initial  desk  review  will  involve  mainly  the  international  procurement  specialist \nworking with ADB staff, and will cover procurement laws, regulations and processes (para. 5). \nThe desk review will be followed by the in-depth field survey and review to assess sector or \nagency procurement performance. These will be the main tasks of the national procurement \nspecialist. Field interviews of government counterparts, development partners, and relevant \nstakeholders will be conducted, supported by assessment of a sample of specific procurement \ntransactions.
