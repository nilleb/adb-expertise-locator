A  key  element  of  good  governance  is  the  accountability  of  government  officials. \nOmbudsman offices and similar institutions of accountability play an important role in protecting \ncitizens by addressing grievances arising from maladministration (such as unnecessary delays, \nfailure to follow proper procedures, negligence, and improper service) by public officials.1 While \nombudsman  institutions  have  been  established  in  a  number  of  Asian  countries,  including \ndeveloping member countries (DMCs) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), sustaining well \nfunctioning ombudsman institutions poses ongoing challenges. \n \n2.  The  Asian  Ombudsman  Association  (AOA)  was  established  in  1996  to  provide  a \nplatform  for  cooperation,  knowledge  sharing,  and  capacity  building  among  ombudsman \ninstitutions in Asia.2 AOA seeks to (i) encourage the development of ombudsman institutions; \n(ii) develop professionalism of ombudsman staff; (iii) encourage and support the study and \nresearch  of  ombudsman\u2019s  offices;  (iv)  sponsor  training  and  educational  programs  for \nombudsman institutions; (v) collect, store, analyze, and disseminate information and research \ndata  about  ombudsman  institutions;  and  (v)  facilitate  the  exchange  of  information  and \nexperience among ombudsmen in Asia.3 The AOA is funded by its members and is located in \nIslamabad, Pakistan. Currently, the AOA has 23 institutional members from 15 Asian countries, \nincluding Azerbaijan; Hong Kong, China; India; Indonesia; Japan; the Kyrgyz Republic; the \nRepublic of Korea; Malaysia; Pakistan; the People\u2019s Republic of China; the Philippines; Sri \nLanka; Thailand; and Viet Nam. The AOA is governed by a nine-member board of directors\u2014 \nthe Wafaqi Mohtasib (Federal Ombudsman) of Pakistan serves as the president. The AOA \nSecretariat oversees AOA operations, including maintaining and updating the AOA website.  \n \n3.  The principal source of AOA funding is membership fees, which are insufficient to enable \nAOA to effectively fulfill its mandate. As a result, interaction among AOA members is limited.  To \nfacilitate more frequent exchange of ideas, knowledge, expertise, and experience among its \nmembers, and to attract new members, a more sustainable business model is needed. In \nfurtherance thereof, in December 2006 the AOA board of directors voted to upgrade the AOA \nSecretariat into a resource center. To help establish the center, AOA requested ADB to provide \ntechnical assistance (TA). This TA paper outlines the purpose and output, methodology and key \nactivities, cost estimates and financing plan, and implementation arrangements.4 The design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n                                                 \n1  Ombudsman institutions generally have the power to diagnose, investigate, and redress injuries suffered to a \nperson through maladministration by government officials. The objective is to institutionalize a system for enforcing \nadministrative accountability. Through a number of initiatives, ADB is supporting, and has supported, ombudsman \ninstitutions in the region. ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan to Support Access to \nJustice. Manila (TA 3823, approved on 20 December, for $900,000); ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance to the \nIslamic Republic of Pakistan to Support Governance Reforms in Pakistan. Manila (TA 4922, approved on 7 March, \nfor $11.5 million); ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to Thailand for Strengthening Accountability Mechanisms. \nManila (TA 3976, approved on 5 November, for $150,000); ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance to Nepal to Support \nAnti-Corruption Institutions. Manila (TA 4962, approved on 30 August, for $400,000); ADB. 2007. Report and \nRecommendations of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan and Technical Assistance Grant \nto Bangladesh to Support Good Governance. Manila (Loan 2362, approved on 30 October, for $150 million).  \n2   The idea to form the AOA was raised in 1995 during a meeting of the board of directors of the International \nOmbudsman Institute (IOI), an organization based in Canada, with broad international membership. IOI suggested \na regional body for promoting the principles and practices of ombudsman be organized in Asia. Subsequently, \nPakistan, supported by the People\u2019s Republic of China, took the initiative to establish the AOA. Currently, there are \nonly a few ombudsman institutions in Asia that belong to both organizations (Hong Kong China, Indonesia, \nThailand, and Pakistan). \n3   See AOA website at http://www.aoa.org.pk \n4   The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 24 April 2008. \n ", "2   \nII.  ISSUES  \n4.  For  ombudsman  institutions  to  be  effective  they  need  to  be  independent,  possess \nsufficient powers to address citizen complaints of maladministration by government officials, and \ntheir staff need to have sufficient capacity to effectively perform their duties. Specifically, staff \nneed exposure to international best practices, including skills needed to handle complaints, \nconduct investigations, and resolve allegations of government maladministration. Efforts of AOA \nmember institutions, particularly those that are newly established, to address their knowledge \nand capacity gaps are hampered by the lack of exposure to lessons learned in other countries \nwhere ombudsman institutions have gone through similar stages. In the absence of international \ninteractions,  most  of  the  new  ombudsman  institutions  engage  in  ad  hoc  and  fragmented \ncapacity enhancements that result in poor and unresponsive ombudsman services. \n \n5.  AOA, an independent and nonpolitical body, was established to provide much-needed \ntraining and capacity enhancement to its members. However, funding constraints currently limit \nAOA\u2019s ability to effectively fulfill this role. AOA annual board meetings and conferences have a \nlimited target audience, since their participants are generally heads of the member institutions. \nIn addition, AOA does not conduct any capacity-building activities at lower tiers of ombudsman \ninstitutions, particularly among those responsible for core functions such as investigation and \nprocessing of complaints. Consequently, AOA members seeking to improve their grievance \nredress mechanisms and service-delivery through peer-to-peer learning and other collaborative \nactivities are not able to do so through AOA. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The TA aims to strengthen the AOA to enable it to help provide capacity development in \nmember institutions, enabling them to become more efficient and responsive in their operations. \nIt will support the establishment of an AOA resource center to facilitate a systematic exchange \nof  ideas,  experiences,  and  best  practices,  and  provide  well  structured  capacity-building \nprograms for member institutions. As AOA is strengthened, it may expand its membership by \nattracting ombudsmen in other Asian countries.  \n \n7.  The impact of the TA will be improved governance and accountability mechanisms in \nAOA member countries. In the long run, improved government accountability and ability to \nundertake corrective action will reduce corruption, inefficiency, and the cost of doing business \nthat adversely impacts economic growth in these countries. The outcome of the TA will be a \nmore effective and efficient AOA.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The TA will support the establishment of a resource center within AOA, the primary \nobjective of which will be to support the operations of member institutions through effective \nknowledge  management,  dissemination,  and  capacity  development.  Establishment  of  the \nresource center will take place in two phases.  \n \n ", "  3\n1.  Phase 1 \n9.  This phase involves preparatory work, including preparation of background surveys to \nclarify the demand for AOA services, development of a medium-term work plan and budget for \nAOA, and adoption of a new business model for AOA.  \n \n10.  Survey Among AOA Members That are DMCs. The TA will support preparation of a \nsurvey among AOA members that are DMCs to clarify their capacity constraints,5 ongoing and \nplanned reform initiatives, development partner support for implementation, and the potential \nrole of AOA in addressing gaps in support, if any. ADB support for AOA member institutions in \neach participating DMC will be highlighted.  \n \n11.  Survey of Regional Best Practices. The TA will support a survey of reform initiatives \nundertaken by Asian ombudsman institutions that effectively address citizen complaints. Lessons \n(along  with  related  performance  indicators)  will  be  highlighted  to  track  the  status  of  reform \ninitiatives. The survey will also include a comparison of the role of ombudsmen in Asian countries.  \n \n12.  Work Plan and Business Model. Based on the survey results, a draft work plan will be \nprepared,  identifying  potential  knowledge  products,  knowledge-sharing  activities,  capacity-\nbuilding activities, expansion of the e-library, and other initiatives6 to be supported by AOA, \nalong with a medium-term budget to fund such activities.  \n \n13.  Based  on  initial  discussions  with  AOA,  the  work  plan  is  envisioned  to  support  the \npreparation of five knowledge products. The proposed topics are (i) important cross-cutting \ncomponents  of  specific  interventions,  (ii)  service  delivery,  (iii)  new  members  and  their \ninstitutional development, (iv) the role of civil society in grievance redress, public awareness \nabout  rights  of  citizens,  and  improving  access  to  ombudsman  services,  and  (v)  important \nemerging  service-delivery  models,  such  as  public\u2013private  partnerships  and  the  use  of \ninformation technology for improving the quality of, and access to, ombudsman services. To the \nextent possible, the studies and assessments should complement ongoing and planned reform \ninitiatives  in  AOA  DMC  member  institutions.  The  work  plan  may  also  support  links  with \nacademic and research institutions on the development of a working paper series to further \ndeepen knowledge on ombudsman services and activities.  \n \n14.  The work plan is also envisioned to support the following.  \n \n(i)  Organization of, and participation in, conferences, seminars, and workshops on a \nselective but focused basis. These may be related to (a) governance issues and \nfreedom of information; (b) knowledge enhancement in operational areas; and \n(c) other areas of strategic focus of AOA members.  \n                                                 \n5  Depending on the availability of resources, the survey may also include other DMC ombudsman institutions which \nare not currently AOA members (e.g., Bangladesh and Nepal). AOA will cover the cost of conducting the survey in \nother non-DMC AOA member countries.  \n6  The work plan may also include new initiatives based on the survey of regional best practices. For example, one \nnew initiative that will be considered is the development of a new framework to help AOA member institutions \nconduct integrity development reviews (IDRs) in government agencies. The IDRs will help to clarify vulnerabilities. \nThe IDR initiative is based on a successful model developed and being implemented by the Office of the \nOmbudsman  of  the  Philippines.  The  IDR  builds  on  the  Corruption  Resistance  Review  developed  by  the \nIndependent Commission Against Corruption of New South Wales and the Corruption Vulnerability Assessment \ntool developed by the Office of Management and Budget of the United States. The IDR aims to build institutional \nfoundations to prevent corruption before it occurs. Another initiative may be the development of an index to track \nthe effectiveness and efficiency of ombudsman institutions in the region.  \n ", "4   \n(ii)  Several  AOA  meetings  and  retreats  to  facilitate  interaction  and  knowledge \nsharing with member institutions. These meetings and retreats should be geared \ntowards second- and third-tier staff in member institutions and revolve around \nthemes central to effective operations and efficient service delivery. \n(iii)  Selective and focused study tours to encourage cross learning and peer-to-peer \ninteraction. The study tours should (a) facilitate understanding of the design and \nimplementation of successful practices, procedures, and policies in addressing \nmaladministration;  and  (b)  provide  a  venue  for  scoping  new  initiatives  for \nimproving ombudsman services. The identification of the study tours should be \nbased on the survey of regional best practices and the study tours should assist \nparticipants develop an action plan on how to implement these practices in their \nlocal ombudsman institutions.  \n(iv)  Staff  exchange  program,  under  which  ombudsman  staff  from  a  DMC  AOA \nmember may participate in an exchange with an ombudsman in another Asian \nombudsman  institution.  The  TA  may  fund  3\u20134  exchanges  per  year.  The \nexchanges aim to (a) contribute to capacity building in participating member \ninstitutions,  (b) develop  closer  and  long-lasting  relationships  among  Asian \nombudsman, (c) develop professional and technical skills and expertise of the \nstaff  exchange  program  participants,  and  (d) foster  cultural  exchange  and \ndiversity.  Objective  criteria  for  choosing  candidates  to  participate  in  these \nexchanges shall be clearly set forth in the work plan, along with a strategy for \nknowledge sharing by participants to help institutionalize new skills and expertise.  \n(v)  Capacity-building  initiatives  on  various  aspects  of  the  operations  of  member \ninstitutions,  including  (a)  complaint  management;  (b)  improving  access  to \ninformation and services of the member institutions; (c) improving the tracking of \ncomplaints  through  the  justice  system;  (d)  developing  performance-based \nindicators;  and  (e)  developing  new  business  processes,  procedures,  and \nsystems to improve efficiency.  \n \n15.  To facilitate online access of AOA members to the latest news, knowledge products, and \ninformation on relevant issues, the work plan will include the upgrade of the AOA website to \nbecome a more effective information portal. \n \n16.  Based  on  the  proposed  work  plan  activities,  a  draft  business  model  and  financing \nstrategy  will  be  developed  to  enable  the  AOA  to  sustain  its  knowledge  management  and \ncapacity-building activities over the medium term. To reduce the potential for duplication and \nfocus on developing AOA\u2019s niche, the work plan will review similar activities conducted by other \nombudsman associations and the costs and benefits of collaboration. The draft work plan and \nbusiness model will be submitted to ADB for comment prior to finalization.  \n \n   2.  Phase 2  \n \n17.  After the work plan has been finalized and approved by AOA, phase 2 will support \nimplementation,  specifically  (i)  funding  specific  knowledge  products  and  capacity-building \nactivities identified in the work plan, (ii) updating the status of the work plan, and (iii) finalizing \noutputs developed thereunder.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n18.  The total estimated TA cost is $900,000 equivalent. It will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s TA funding program. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n ", "  5\n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  The TA will be implemented over 2 years from July 2008 to June 2010. ADB will be the \nExecuting Agency and the Central and West Asia Governance and Finance Division (CWGF) \nwill  implement  the  TA  in  close  collaboration  with  AOA.  ADB  support  will  be  limited  to \nombudsman institutions in ADB DMCs. An ADB committee\u2014comprising one staff member from \neach of CWGF, other operational departments which have AOA members,7 the Regional and \nSustainable  Development  Department,  and  the  Office  of  the  General  Counsel\u2014will  be \nconstituted to ensure quality control during the TA implementation.  \n \n20.  The AOA board will provide overall policy and strategic guidance for the activities of the \nresource center. The AOA board will form an advisory committee for knowledge management, \nheaded by a board member selected by the board. 8 The advisory committee shall determine \ncriteria for the selection of candidates for study tours and secondments, adopt the workplan, \ninteract regularly with ADB, and help identify consultants under the TA. The advisory committee \nwill meet at least once every 4 months, will report to the AOA board, and will be responsible for \nevaluating activities under the TA. The AOA resource center will implement the TA and oversee \nthe  preparation  of  TA  outputs,  including  a  performance  monitoring  framework.  A  program \nmanager for the resource center will be designated by the AOA Secretariat, with the overall \nresponsibility for ensuring the achievement of the resource center strategic directions, and to \nfacilitate coordination and involvement of all AOA members. \n \n21.  No activities financed under the TA may be held in a DMC unless ADB receives a no-\nobjection letter from such DMC. \n \n22.  The TA will require 7 person-months of international experts and 28 person-months of \nnational consulting services. Of the national consultants, one will be engaged on a long-term \nbasis to provide inputs to enhance the effectiveness of the resource center. All consultants will \nbe hired as individual consultants according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Equipment  will  be  procured  through  the  shopping \nmethod according to ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). The \noutline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $900,000 on a grant basis for \nStrengthening the Asian Ombudsman Association, and hereby reports this action to the Board.\n                                                 \n7  Southeast Asia Governance Finance and Trade Division; South Asia Government Finance and Trade Division; and \nEast Asia Country Coordination, Regional Cooperation, Governance, Finance and Trade Division.  \n8  The advisory committee will comprise (i) the executive secretary of the AOA, (ii) the program manager designated \nfor the resource center, and (iii) four members of the AOA other than board members. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n    Data Sources and/or   \nDesign  Performance Targets  Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  and/or Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \nImproved governance  Improvement in  AOA annual reports  AOA knowledge sharing \nand accountability in  performance in World    and capacity-building \nAOA member  Bank governance  Annual reports of  activities are sustained \ncountries.  indicators for  Asian ombudsman  beyond TA \nombudsman institutions  institutions  implementation period \nin AOA member     \ncountries.
