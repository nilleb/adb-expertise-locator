INTRODUCTION \n1.  In its National Common Minimum Program, the Government of India (the Government) \nemphasized the importance of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) for economic growth, \nemployment  generation,  and  poverty  reduction.  The  Government  requested  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) for technical assistance (TA)1 to prepare a project to support the \ndevelopment of SME finance in India. The TA and the ensuing project are confirmed in the \nCountry Strategy and Program Update 2004\u20132006. ADB support will complement assistance \nbeing  provided  by  other  development  partners  to  enhance  competitiveness  of  SMEs  by \nimproving the enabling environment, facilitating access to commercial finance, and providing \nbusiness development services (BDS). The Department for International Development (DFID) of \nthe  United  Kingdom,  the  German  Government  through  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Technische \nZusammenarbeit (GTZ) and Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau (KfW), and the World Bank Group \nare contributing to this effort. ADB TA implementation will be closely coordinated to avoid \nduplication of effort. An ADB Fact-Finding Mission met in May 2004 with the Government\u2014the \nMinistry of Finance (MOF), Ministry of Small Scale Industries, Small Industries Development \nBank of India (SIDBI), selected state financial corporations (SFCs), the Reserve Bank of India \n(RBI)\u2014and other key stakeholders and agreed on the objectives, scope, and implementation \narrangements of the TA.  This report reflects the agreement reached with the Government.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  India has a vibrant SME sector. Currently, there is only an official definition for a small-\nscale industry (SSI) unit. While most SSIs are defined as enterprises with investments in plant \nand machinery of up to Rs10 million ($219,000), the Government is now considering defining \nthe threshold for SMEs of up to Rs100 million ($2.19 million) for the same criteria.2 The SSI \nsubset of the SME sector consists of about 12 million enterprises, of which only 20% are \nregistered. Despite the large proportion of unregistered SSIs, the informal sector accounted for \nonly 23% of gross national income in 2003, indicating far higher productivity and profitability of \nregistered  units.  Registered  SSIs  constitute  95%  of  all  manufacturing  enterprises,  and  in \nFY2002, accounted for 40% of industrial output ($165 billion), 35% of export revenues ($18 \nbillion), and 45% of formal industrial employment (19 million).3 \n3.   Since India\u2019s independence, the Government has developed policies and a large public \nsector infrastructure to support SSIs. At the heart of the SSI promotion policies were production \nprotection, preferential conditions, tax exemptions, subsidized support schemes, priority sector \nlending, and a large network of public sector business service providers and banks. During the \npeak of protection in the mid-1980s, about 900 products were reserved for SSI production.4 \nProtection policies have been essentially targeted for producing enterprises, especially those \nwhose products were targeted for the domestic market, while exporting and trading units have \nbeen more exposed to competition. BDS for the SME sector are provided mainly through a large \nnetwork  of  public  sector  agencies,  both  at  central  and  state  government  levels,  for \nentrepreneurship  development,  training,  marketing,  export,  technology  transfer,  and \n                                                 \n1  The TA was first listed in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 28 June 2004. \n2  Various industries and product lines have special SSI thresholds; the largest threshold is Rs50 million for \ninvestment in machinery and equipment. Unlike other countries, business turnover and employment size are not \ncriteria used for defining an SSI/SME in India. Recently, the Ganguly Committee has recommended the following \nthresholds by business turnover: (i) up to Rs20 million\u2014tiny units, (ii) up to Rs200 million\u2014SSI units, and (iii) up to \nRs500 million\u2014medium-sized units. \n3  Since 80% of the SSIs operate in the informal sector, the real significance for employment is much higher. \n4  Currently there are 675 reserved items and a further reduction by 85 items has been recommended. \n ", "2 \nconsultancy.  Despite  the  significant  policy  and  institutional  support,  the  public  sector  BDS \nproviders have been unable to extend their outreach beyond 1% of the SSI units.  \n4.  In the 1990s, the Government recognized that the previous interventionist approach was \nno longer suitable and embarked on significant market-based reforms in the enterprise and \nfinancial sector. Most bank deposit and lending rates have been liberalized, prudential norms \nand supervision improved, and priority sector lending has been reduced. India\u2019s banking sector \nconsists of 295 commercial banks, most of which are publicly owned, though 67 are privately \nowned. Public sector banks control three quarters of banking system assets and account for \nabout 90% of lending to SSIs. The State Bank of India (SBI) and its eight associates alone \naccount for about 30% of the banking system assets and loans to SSIs. About 80% of bank \nlending is targeted to urban markets. The rural segment is served by the 19 nationalized banks \n(52%), SBI (27%), and the 196 rural banks (14%). Private banks play a marginal role.  \n5.  The banking system directed about 12% of its overall net lending to SSIs during the 6 \nyears since 1997.  While the aggregate SSI loan portfolio increased by 8% annually, it grew far \nbelow the 14% annual growth of commercial credit during the same period. Since SSI output \ngrowth consistently exceeded the growth of the overall private sector, it is obvious that financial \nintermediaries (FIs) do not recognize the significance of SSIs for their business growth. With \nhigher credit growth, the contribution of SSIs to growth could have been more significant.  \n6.  The low growth in SSI lending demonstrates that priority sector lending to SSIs did not \nproduce the desired results. Saddled by high nonperforming loans (NPLs) in the SSI segment \n(about 15\u201321% of public sector banks\u2019 loans to SSIs), priority sector lending is largely viewed by \nthe banks as a social liability and many institutions do not recognize the large potential of the \nSME market as a business. Other reasons for the weak growth of SME credit are (i) the large \nnumber  of  unregistered  enterprises,  which  require  different  lending  and  risk  management \ntechniques, processes, and skills; (ii) lack of fixed collateral among SMEs that banks typically \nrequire; (iii) lack of a secured transactions law to regulate assignment and registry of movables; \nand (iv) the difficulty and high cost of registering property5 and enforcing contracts. Despite high \nliquidity, banks still focus on narrow market segments such as consumer and home loans that \nare perceived to be less risky and more profitable. RBI statistics show that about 420,000 \naccounts represented 17% of outstanding loans in the range of  $10,000\u2013100,000 in 2000 for \nSMEs.  Given  India\u2019s  large  number  of  SMEs,  this  is  a  very  small  coverage.  Market-based \napproaches to credit for SMEs need to be developed to tap this large potential.  \n7.  Recognizing the importance of SMEs for growth and employment in the economy, the \nGovernment views the growing financial resource gap as a major concern, estimating the term \ncredit needs for SMEs at Rs634 billion ($13.9 billion) for the 10th Plan period (FY2002\u20132007), \nand working capital needs at Rs1,230 billion ($27 billion) during the final year of the Plan. It \nannounced an Rs100 billion ($2.2 billion) credit package to SMEs for FY2004\u20132006. To address \nthe credit gap to SMEs, the Government established SIDBI in 1990 under an Act of Parliament. \nSIDBI lends through FIs, essentially banks and SFCs, and more recently directly to SMEs. As of \n31 March 2003, FI lending comprised 92%, and direct lending only 8%, of its loan portfolio; \nSFCs form the largest part of SIDBI\u2019s FI lending operations with Rs44 billion ($0.95 billion) or \n31% of FI loans outstanding. \n8.  Eighteen SFCs were established under the SFC Act of 1951 (amended in 2000), to \nfinance SSIs at the state level. While SFCs were an important source of medium-term credit \n                                                 \n5  A recent World Bank survey states that registration in India costs double the regional average. This undermines \nthe use of property for collateral purposes. For more details, see http://rru.worldbank.org/DoingBusiness. \n ", "  3\nduring the 1970s and 1980s, lending fell drastically from 1998 to 2000 with aggregate annual \ndisbursements to SSIs dropping from 38% to 20% of the net credit increment of the banking \nsector to SSIs during that period. Intervention by state governments and, consequently, lack of \nindependence of SFC management, as well as poor underwriting and loan management have \ncontributed  to  high  NPLs.  Further,  SFCs  have  been  weakened  by  frequent  changes  of \nmanagement, high cost of funds, business restrictions under the SFC Act, and absence of \neffective powers for prudential regulation and supervision by RBI and/or SIDBI. To address the \nSFCs\u2019 insolvency, the Government established the Gupta Committee, which estimated in early \n2001 that the 18 SFCs have an aggregate negative net worth of Rs33.3 billion ($0.7 billion). \nHowever, the committee felt that 14 SFCs continued to be relevant and would require about \nRs24.5 billion ($0.5 billion) to recapitalize. The recommendations have not been fully accepted \nas the committee proposed that the Government, RBI, and SIDBI take over two thirds of the \nrestructuring/recapitalization cost, while the concerned states as principal owners would bear \nonly  one  third  of  the  cost.  The  committee  was  also  less  specific  about  the  operational \nrestructuring aspects that are normally prerequisites for successful restructuring. In 2004, RBI \nestablished the Ganguly Committee6 to study means to (i) improve the flow of credit to the SSI \nsector and (ii) revive SFCs as a conduit of funds to SMEs. That committee recommended the \nfollowing: (i) repeal the SFC Act, (ii) restructure commercially viable SFCs as vehicles for FIs for \nfunding  SMEs,  (iii) facilitate  SFC  restructuring  by  NPL  transfer  to  asset  reconstruction \ncompanies, (iv) the state government stake in SFCs may be taken over by SIDBI or banks, and \n(v) reconstitute  individual  or  groups  of  SFCs  under  the  Companies  Act.  SIDBI  signed \nagreements  with  nine  SFCs  requiring  compliance  with  financial  and  operational  targets  in \nexchange for providing financial support. However, a holistic approach is required to put SFCs \non a sound basis.  \n9.  There  is  also  a  need  for  an  integrated  policy  and  institutional  framework  for  SME \ndevelopment including (i) defining the role of the Government and the private sector in providing \nBDS, (ii) identifying underwriting and management processes for enhancing the commercial \noutreach  of  lending  to  SMEs,  (iii) identifying  appropriate  policy  packages  and  institutional \nsupport for access to export markets, and (iv) developing effective credit enhancements in \naddition to the credit guarantee fund. A comprehensive SME strategy and effective collaboration \nof the Government, FIs, and BDS providers is necessary to realize the targets of the 10th Plan. \n10.  The development partner efforts aim at improving policies for SME finance, building \ncapacity, mitigating credit risk, and meeting financing needs. While the World Bank and KfW will \nprovide credit lines for lending by commercial banks, DFID and GTZ will provide TA to enhance \ncapacity  for  SME  finance,  BDS,  and  the  business  environment.  The  ADB  support  will \ncomplement this initiative and arrangements will be put in place to ensure good coordination.  \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n11.  The  TA  is  to  prepare  an  SME  project  aimed  at  improving  SME  growth  and \ncompetitiveness and at developing SME finance in collaboration with the Government and other \nkey stakeholders. The TA will (i) review effectiveness of past approaches in support of SME \nfinance;  (ii) identify  solutions  for  improving  service  delivery,  commercial  viability,  and \nappropriate prudential supervision of SFCs; (iii) identify broad policy issues to be addressed for \n                                                 \n6  The mandate of the Ganguly Committee, established by the Governor of RBI, covered a broad range of issues \nand institutions to facilitate the flow of credit to SSIs. The terms of reference and the findings can be viewed at \nhttp://www.rbi.org.in/sec21/53524.pdf. \n ", "4 \nimproving  the  business  environment  and  SME  access  to  market\u2013based  financial  services, \nincluding  credit  and  BDS;  and  (iv) developing  a  strategy  and  incentive  framework  for  FIs, \nincluding SFCs, for providing financing to SMEs on a sustained basis. The TA puts particular \nemphasis  on  institutional  reforms  successfully  tested  elsewhere  and  will  (i) examine  the \nfinancial and operational status of the FIs, especially the SFCs, at the national and state levels, \n(ii) identify  SFCs  with  turnaround  potential  and  draw  up  strategic  and  operational  plans, \n(iii) examine how SIDBI\u2019s role can be enhanced in responding to the changing needs of the \nSMEs,  (iv) review  the  current  legal  and  regulatory  framework  to  remove  constraints  and \nfacilitate SME access to credit and BDS, and (v) identify enhancement of SME creditworthiness. \nAs set out in the project framework  (Appendix 1) and detailed in the outline terms of reference \n(Appendix 2), the TA comprises three components, developed in a consultative process.  \n12.  Component 1 will review effectiveness of past government and FI-led approaches to \nSME financing, identify gaps in development of the sector, and provide solutions for improving \nthe policy and enabling environment, including incentives, market-based financial services, and \nBDS, based on lessons learned in India and elsewhere.  \n13.  Component 2 will identify detailed options, sequencing, and implementation plans for the \nturnaround and commercialization of SFCs; assess the state governments\u2019 commitment to the \nrecommended  reforms;  and  identify  the  SFCs\u2019  role,  including  business  and  restructuring \nstrategies and plans. This component will also examine SIDBI\u2018s role in light of the needs of SFC \nrestructuring and the changing SME business environment. This entails both direct lending and \nindirect  lending  to  commercial  FIs  and  SFCs  at  acceptable  portfolio  quality,  and  further \nenhancing SIDBI\u2019s capacity as apex body for SME finance and oversight of the SFCs. It also \nincludes reviewing RBI\u2019s policy and practice in regulating and supervising SFCs.  \n14.  Component 3 will examine the potential and scope for institutional and product-based \ncredit enhancements, and for building capacity among FIs to improve SME access to credit.   \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n15.  As detailed in Appendix 2, the TA will be implemented in three phases commencing by \nFebruary 2005.7 The first (diagnostic) phase entails a full review as indicated under component \n1, and analysis and detailed implementation plans for components 2 and 3.  Within 6 weeks of \ncommencement of the TA (by end-March 2005) stakeholders will review the findings and agree \non the scope for designing the SME loan.  \n16.  The second (design) phase will develop the detailed design solutions, strategies, and \noperational plans for each component; a draft development policy matrix; and implementation \narrangements. Within 20 weeks of the commencement of the TA, stakeholders will review \nfindings and agree on final design and implementation arrangements for the ensuing SME loan.  \n17.  The third (final design) phase will aim to ensure full support of stakeholders, completion \nof the policy matrix, detailed action plans for meeting reform objectives, and finalization of \nimplementation arrangements for the SME loan within 28 weeks of the commencement of the \nTA. To facilitate a smooth transition to implementation, about 10% of the TA resources will be \nutilized based on an agreed plan at the end of the final design. The TA will be completed by \nJune 2006 and TA accounts will close by December 2006. The consultant will submit reports as \nset out in Appendix 2. \n                                                 \n7  The time schedule is tentative and depends on the timely effectiveness of the TA, recruitment of consultants, and \neffective  stakeholder  feedback.  The  stakeholder  feedback  ensures  adequate  building  of  ownership  and \naddressing any relevant poverty and social issues. The initial poverty and social analysis is in Appendix 3. \n ", "  5\nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The cost of the TA is estimated at $1 million equivalent, of which $610,000 is in foreign \ncurrency and $390,000 equivalent is in local currency. ADB will finance $800,000, including the \nentire foreign exchange cost and $190,000 equivalent in local currency. The Government will \ncontribute the remaining $200,000 equivalent in kind, which will include office expenses and \ncounterpart staff remuneration. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Government of \nthe United Kingdom. The Government has been advised that financing of the TA does not \ncommit ADB to financing the ensuing project. Details of the cost estimates are in Appendix 4. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  MOF will be the Executing Agency, while SIDBI will be the implementing agency. In \naddition to stakeholder reviews, a steering committee will provide strategic guidance. It will be \nchaired by MOF secretary (financial sector) and will include representatives from MOF Banking \nDivision,  Department  of  Economic  Affairs,  the  Department  for  SSIs,  SIDBI,  and  once \ndetermined, each of the state governments in which SFCs have been selected for restructuring. \nFor stakeholder feedback, TA reports will be posted on SIDBI\u2019s web site. A separate panel of \nboth  international  and  domestic  experts  will  peer  review  the  TA  findings.  Tripartite  review \nmeetings involving the steering committee, consultants, and ADB will be chaired by MOF. \n20.  An international firm will be recruited to provide a team of consultants of about 35 \nperson-months, of which about 65% international and 35% domestic experts will have expertise \nin SME policy, and finance; FI restructuring, commercialization, and business strategy; SME \ncredit; financial sector regulatory and governance; and BDS. The consulting services require an \ninnovative approach to SFC restructuring including strategies, and business plans; prudential \nsupervision by a financial apex intermediary and RBI, awareness building at the stakeholder \nlevel,  and  identification  of  SFCs  and  state-level  government  commitment.  There  is  no \nstandardized approach for service delivery and the task of developing restructuring solutions \nincluding systems, lending processes, and procedures is complex technically and falls into the \npolitical domain and thus requires a high level of specialized technical and communication skills. \nDeveloping solutions with a number of stakeholders with different interests requires a significant \ndegree of flexibility in the allocation of expertise as well as management of the design process. \nFor these reasons, the consulting firm will be recruited under quality-based selection. The \nconsultants  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  the  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic \nconsultants.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 to the Government \nof India to be financed on a grant basis by the Government of the United Kingdom for preparing \nthe Small and Medium Enterprise Finance Sector Development Project, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n ", " \nPRELIMINARY PROJECT FRAMEWORK (To be revised during Implementation)a  6 \n \nDesign Summary  Performance Indicators/Targets  Monitoring Mechanisms  Risks \nGoal  \u2022 Growth of SME exports   \u2022 RBI annual report    A\np\nEnhance growth and competitiveness of the  \u2022 Growth of SME exporters  \u2022 SIDBI annual report  pe\nSME Sector  \u2022 Growth of SME manufacturing value added  \u2022 TA reports  nd\n\u2022 Growth of SME sales turnover  \u2022 TA review meetings  ix 1\n\u2022 Growth of SME employment  \u2022 Economic survey report of   \n\u2022 Growth of formal credit to the sector  the Government \nPurpose  \u2022  Policy reform agenda and action plans for improving SME    \u2022 TA steering committee   \nImprove the SME Sector\u2019s access to formal  finance and incentive framework  meetings  \u2022 Continued government \ncredit on a sustained basis  \u2022  Agreed policy reform and action plan for improving enabling  \u2022 Tripartite reviews  commitment to economic \n  environment  \u2022 Consultant reports   reforms, employment \n  \u2022 Stakeholder feedback and  generation, and poverty \n\u2022  Reform and action plans for improving BDS \n  consensus on reforms  reduction \n\u2022  Institutional reform and action plans for FIs engaged in SME \n\u2022 Special committee reports   \nfinance at national and state levels  \n\u2022 ADB review missions \n\u2022  Credit enhancement and other risk mitigation measures \n\u2022  Policy matrix and detailed implementation arrangements \nOutputs  Phase 1\u2014Diagnostic:      \nComponent 1:   \u2022 Full diagnostic review of component 1, and analysis and  \u2022  Consultant reports  \u2022 Continued thrust on \n\u2022 Review Government and FI-led approaches  detailed options for components 2 and 3  \u2022  Tripartite meetings  SME development and \nto SME finance   \u2022 Meetings with stakeholders in the Government, FIs, chambers  \u2022  Restructuring plans and    poverty reduction by all \n\u2022 Identify gaps to improve the policy and  of commerce, and SME associations      reports  stakeholders \nenabling environment, financial services,  \u2022 Stakeholder seminar within 6 weeks of TA commencement (by  \u2022 Action plans for resolving      \u2022 Business climate does \nand BDS through market-based  end-March 2005)    NPLs  not deteriorate \nmechanisms  Phase 2\u2014Design: Develop detailed design, strategies, and  \u2022  ADB review missions \nComponent 2:   operational plans for each component   \u2022  A separate advisory panel \n\u2022 Identify options, sequencing, and plans for  \u2022 Draft policy matrix and implementation arrangements within 16  comprising international \ncommercialization of SFCs  weeks of TA commencement   and domestic experts to \n\u2022 Assess state governments\u2019 commitment to  \u2022 Stakeholder meetings within 20 weeks of TA commencement  carry out a peer review of \nSFC reforms  (by latest end-June 2005) to agree on final design and  the TA findings \n\u2022 Identify SFC business role, strategies, and  implementation arrangements   \nplans   Phase 3\u2014Final Design: Buy-in of stakeholders, completion of   \n\u2022 Develop solutions for SFC resolution  policy matrix, detailed reform action plans, and implementation   \n\u2022 Examine SIDBI\u2019s role in light of the  arrangements within 28 weeks of TA commencement  \nchanging needs of the environment  \u2022 About 10% of the TA resources will be utilized based on an \nComponent 3:   agreed plan at the end of the final design.

Context.  The  Government  has  sought  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  technical \nassistance (TA) to prepare a small and medium enterprise (SME) finance sector development \nloan in 2005. Concurrent with this initiative, the Government will be supported by a number of \ndevelopment partners including the World Bank Group, Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau (KfW), \nDeutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ), and Department for International \nDevelopment (DFID) in developing the sector. Arrangements are currently being finalized and it \nis critical that the evolving design for the ADB-supported initiative is grounded in the overall \neffort,  and  duplication  of  effort  is  avoided.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  and  the  Small \nIndustries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) are the executing and implementing agencies for \nthe initiatives.  \n2.  Key Agencies and Institutions. Involved in the design of the ADB initiative are (i) the \nfederal Government, represented by MOF, and the Ministry of Small Scale Industries; (ii) the \nstate governments in which state financial corporations (SFCs) operate; (iii) Reserve Bank of \nIndia (RBI); (iv) SIDBI; (v) the SFCs; (vi) commercial banks; (vii) chambers of commerce; and \n(viii) trade and industry associations. The Government has established steering committees for \nthe  multi-development  partner  initiative  and  the  ADB  TA  to  ensure  timely  guidance  and \nfeedback. In addition, the ADB TA will ensure feedback from the private sector and independent \nexperts to ensure that the design reflects the needs of the beneficiaries and embodies relevant \nlessons  learned  in  India  and  internationally.  It  is  critical  that  the  consulting  services  are \nimplemented  in  a  consultative  and  evolutionary  manner,  seeking  stakeholder  support  and \nfeedback for solutions, while highlighting important design issues, benefits, and risks in a clear \nand concise manner. The outputs of the TA will serve as the basis for the Government and ADB \nin finalizing the objectives, scope, and implementation arrangements for the SME program. \n3.  Objective. The goal of the loan is to enhance growth and competitiveness of the SMEs \nand to help fulfill the Government\u2019s objectives for exports, economic growth, employment, and \npoverty reduction as stated in its 10th Plan.  The immediate objective of the TA is providing the \nbasis for designing the ensuing SME loan, based on lessons learned in India and elsewhere. \n4.  Scope. ADB and the Government agreed on the following scope and structure: \n(i)  Component 1.

Consultative Implementation Process. The Consultant will implement the terms of \nreference in three phases in a consultative process commencing by February 2005.9  \n(i)  The first (diagnostic) phase entails a full review as indicated under component 1 \nand analysis and detailed options for implementing the remaining components \nduring the second phase. Specifically it includes the selection of SFCs and a \nproposed set of actions for SIDBI, RBI, and the Government to be implemented \nduring  the  design  phase.  Assisted  by  SIDBI,  the  consultants  will  organize \nmeetings and workshops with stakeholders in the Government, FIs, and the \nprivate sector including chambers of commerce and SME associations and a \nstakeholder seminar within 6 weeks of commencement of the TA (by end-March \n2005) to review the findings and agree on the scope for designing the SME loan.   \n(ii)  The second (design) phase will, based on a detailed plan agreed between the \nGovernment and ADB at the end of the diagnostic phase, develop the detailed \ndesign solutions, strategies, and operational plans for each component, as well \nas  the  draft  development  policy  matrix  and  implementation  arrangements \nlogically  organized  in  outcome  and  key  results  areas,  within  16  weeks  of \ncommencement of the TA.  Assisted by SIDBI, the consultants will organize \nmeetings  and  workshops  with  the  stakeholders  mentioned  above  within  20 \nweeks of commencement of the TA (latest by end-June 2005) to review the \nfindings and agree on final design and implementation arrangements for the \nensuing SME loan. \n(iii)  The third (final design) phase will ensure support of stakeholders of the SME \nloan and completion of the policy matrix, detailed action plans for meeting reform \nobjectives,  and  the  cost  of  reform  and  finalization  of  implementation \narrangements for the loan, within 28 weeks of commencement of the TA.

The TA will be completed by end-June \n2006 and TA accounts will close by December 2006.  \n6.  Policy Guidance and Quality Enhancement. In addition to stakeholder reviews, a \nsteering  committee  will  provide  overall  strategic  guidance,  and  a  separate  advisory  panel \ncomprising both international and domestic experts will carry out a peer review of the TA \nfindings  at  the  three  stages  of  TA  implementation.  Tripartite  reviews  involve  the  steering \ncommittee, consultants, and ADB, and will be chaired by MOF.  \n7.  SIDBI will establish a counterpart team at its office in Mumbai, which will oversee the \nSFC operations to manage the TA, and counterpart teams will be established at those SFCs \nthat participate in the TA. \n8.  Consulting Services and Expertise. An international consulting firm will be engaged to \nprovide the services in a well-coordinated manner. Using the terms of reference, short-listed \nconsulting firms will prepare full technical proposals reflecting discussions with key stakeholders \nin India, and reflecting a proposed concept approach to implement the TA. The consulting firm \nwill be responsible for (i) the effective implementation of the proposed approach as reflected in \nthe technical proposal and the consulting contract; (ii) suitability of the specialists in terms of \ncultural sensitivity and communication skills, technical expertise, and ability to produce analysis \nand  solutions  in  a  clear  concise  way  relevant  to  the  legal,  regulatory,  and  operational \nenvironment in India; and (iii) flexibility in addressing the stakeholders\u2019 and ADB\u2019s concerns. \nThe consultant is free to bundle certain specializations in one suitable individual and rearrange \nthe responsibilities as deemed appropriate. The consultant will have substantial backstopping \nfacilities to provide quality review, alternative personnel, and systems support at short notice, \nand home support in the region is desirable.  \n9.  The consultative and evolving nature of the TA will require of the consultant a high level \nof flexibility in assigning the expertise resources. However, given existing information available \nthe following utilization of overall TA resources is indicated: Phase 1: 20%; Phase 2: 50%; and \nPhase 3: 30%, of which 10% will be reserved to accommodate implementation preparation for \nthe  SME  loan  in  the  period  between  government  and  management  approval  and  start  of \noperations.  It is estimated that an overall 35 person-months are required to implement the TA, \nof which about two thirds will be international expertise and one third domestic expertise. The \nperson-months and the above indicative resource allocation provide a broad idea of the possible \nworkload in each phase. While the consultant is free to modify the level of input of the individual \nexperts,  the  total  amount  of  services  may  not  exceed  the  budgeted  and  subsequently \ncontracted cost. \n10.  The consulting firm will have a proven track record in managing policy and institutional \nchange, and product development in developing countries and more advanced economies, with \na strong presence in South Asia.

No \nThough  there  is  no  country  poverty \npartnership  agreement,  the  SME  sector \nhas been identified as critical for poverty \nreduction in India's 10th Five-Year Plan, \nthe National Common Minimum Program, \nand the Country Strategy and Program  \n(2002\u20132006). \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in India: \n \nThe small and medium enterprise (SME) sector is vital to the Indian economy as it constitutes 95% of all industrial \nunits and contributes 40% of industrial output and 45% of formal industrial employment. In the emerging economy of \nIndia, SMEs are the prime drivers of new employment. The development of the SME sector will enhance the \neconomic structure and income- and employment-generating activities, reduce income disparity, and contribute to \noverall macroeconomic stability and poverty reduction. The 10th Five-Year Plan has placed great reliance on small \nenterprises for attaining the overall economic growth and employment targets set for the plan period.  \n \nGiven its high multiplier effect on the national economy, the SME sector is critical for financing and policy intervention \nto support the growth rate of the economy. The Project will support the Government\u2019s recognition of the significant role \nSMEs can play in achieving national development goals and its efforts to attain the 10th Plan objectives of 8% growth, \n10% industrial growth, and 1 million jobs a year. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                       Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nSMEs enhance competition and entrepreneurship and hence have external benefits on economy-wide efficiency, \ninnovation, and aggregate productivity growth. This will help exploit the social benefits from greater competition and \nentrepreneurship, lead to more productivity, and boost employment, as SMEs operations are more labor intensive. \nThe Government recognizes the important potential of SMEs for job creation. \n \nThe state financial corporations (SFCs) were created for supporting entrepreneurial development, employment \ngeneration, poverty reduction, and reduction in regional disparities. Since SFCs have been conceived as institutions of \nnational importance in the rural and backward regions of the states, the Government requested assistance to support \nthe restructuring those SFCs that have the potential to become commercially viable. Because of the nature of the \ninstitutional reforms, the impact on poverty will be indirect.  \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes   No  \n \nThe social assessment is integral part of the technical assistance (TA) implementation and will involve iterative \nconsultation with the following stakeholders: SME entrepreneurs, SFCs, Small Industries Development Bank of India \n(SIDBI), related state governments, the central Government, financial intermediaries (FIs), and industry chambers and \nassociations. The focus will be on (i) cost-effective SME credit delivery, which includes SMEs operated by women; \n(ii) improved financial services of FIs; and (iii) enhanced access of SMEs to credit through policies and incentives. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                 No \n \nStakeholder participation is a key element of the design and implementation arrangements for the TA. Stakeholders \nwill be consulted during the three phases of the TA and views will be consolidated and validated at the end of each \nphase to ensure that policy reforms have been adequately discussed and agreed upon. Through improved viability of \nFIs, SME stakeholders will be able to participate more in contributing to economic growth, jobs, and income \ngeneration. \n ", "12  Appendix 3       \n \nD.
