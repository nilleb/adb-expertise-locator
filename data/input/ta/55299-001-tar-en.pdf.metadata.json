The transaction TA facility will support the development of bankable ongoing and future \nsocial sector projects in developing member countries (DMCs), as listed below. The ongoing \nprojects and future PPP project/(s) supported by the transaction TA facility aims to enhance the \nprivate sector\u2019s involvement in delivering sustainable social services such as elderly care, health, \nand education.  OPPP will provide transaction advisory services (TAS) and will be supported by \ntechnical,  legal,  and  national  PPP  procurement  experts.  This  will  include  conducting  due \ndiligence,  preparation  of  financial  viability  assessment  and  implementation  plan,  preparing \ndocumentation (including concession agreement and other agreements), developing financial \nmodels, assisting the timely completion of contract negotiations, and performing other activities \nas may be required. The outputs will focus on support needed by the DMCs to develop bankable \nand sustainable PPP projects.  \n \nOngoing projects:  \n(a) 50391-001 Demonstration of Guangxi Elderly Care and Health Care Integration and \nPublic Private Partnership Project \n(b) 52245-001 Xiangyang Hubei Elderly Care Service Development with Public\u2013Private \nPartnership Project \n \nPipeline of future projects:  \n(a) UZB - Development of secondary/tertiary healthcare facilities  \n(b) INO  - Development of medical colleges/universities  \n(c) PAK  -  Development  of  vaccine  capacity  as  related  to  expanded  program  on \nimmunization  \n \n \n2.  Rapidly aging populations across various DMCs can no longer rely on traditional family \nand social structures.  The public and private sectors both play an increasingly important role in \nelderly care, and it is important that sustainable public-private partnership models that leverage \nthe expertise and efficiency of the private sector are developed to deliver quality elderly care. ADB \nhas provided sovereign loans to three elderly care projects in PRC, which are currently supported \nby OPPP, namely: (i) 50391-001 Demonstration of Guangxi Elderly Care and Health Care \nIntegration and Public Private Partnership Project; (ii) 52245-001 Xiangyang Hubei Elderly Care \nService Development with Public\u2013Private Partnership Project; and (iii) 4909-002 Hubei Yichang \nComprehensive  Elderly  Care  Demonstration  Project,  to  promote,  coordinate  and  deliver \nintegrated elderly care and health care for those in need, serving as demonstration projects.  The \ntransaction TA facility will support two of these projects, which are covered by advisory mandates \nfor OPPP.1  \n \n3.   Pandemic impact.  Older persons are highly susceptible to infectious diseases and \nelderly care facilities are at high risk of infections. Geriatric care-focused hospitals serve older \npatients who are at high risk of hospital-acquired infections. The international evidence associated \n \n \n1The  projects covered by a TAS mandate for OPPP and to be supported by the transaction TA facility are 50391-001 \nDemonstration  of  Guangxi  Elderly  Care  and  Health  Care  Integration  and  Public  Private  Partnership  Project \n(https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/prc-50391-001-rrp); and 52245-001 Xiangyang Hubei Elderly Care Service \nDevelopment with Public\u2013Private Partnership Project (https://www.adb.org/projects/documents/prc-52245-001-rrp). \n ", "2 \nwith coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreaks shows the high risk of mortality associated with \nCOVID-19 in care homes, with indications that the number of deaths in care homes accounts for \nabout 30%\u201350% of all COVID-19 deaths in various economies.2 Hence, it is important to consider \npreparedness and response by elderly care and other social sector facilities to infectious disease \nthreats.  Identification  and  development  of  risk  mitigating  measures  will  be  developed  and \nimplemented at various stages of the project lifecycle. During project preparation, a risk register \nwill be developed to analyze key project risks, including risks associated with infectious diseases \nand pandemics.  At the design and planning stages, the need for well-ventilated and flexible \nspaces that can be converted for isolation purposes will be considered. At the operations stage, \na range of approaches will be considered including: (i) staff training; (ii) adaptability of information \ncommunications technology to support wider efforts to contain the spread of infectious diseases \nwithin  the  facility;  and  (iii)  maintaining  optimal  levels  of  supplies  and  personal  protective \nequipment at the facility.    \n \n4.  Gender elements.  In line with the gender considerations per the on-going projects and \nfor future projects, this TRTA Facility seeks to promote gender elements by encouraging gender-\nsensitive workplace practices and policies among the private sector operators, as they align with \nthe DMC\u2019s statutory requirements.   In  addition,  the  PPP  framework  which  defines  relevant \nimplementation arrangements can identify potential gender-sensitive elements in the operations \nand maintenance of the elderly care facilities.  \n \n5.    Other support.  As women live longer and require more care during periods of ill health, \nhigher quality healthcare and elderly care will improve the quality of life for older persons. For \nunpaid/family caregivers, the majority of whom are women, it will increase their opportunities to \njoin the paid labor force.  As outlined in the Project Administration Manual (PAM), the on-going \nprojects will support the use of gender-sensitive arrangements with separate facilities for men and \nwomen, enhance job opportunities for women during the construction and operation phases, \nimprove working conditions, and provide training opportunities for women to strengthen their skills \n \nand capacity. \n \nB.

The key expenditure items are listed \nin Appendix 1. The TA facility will be subject to arrangements that will seek recovery of the cost \nfinanced under the TA facility when commercial close is achieved.  Terms of cost recovery will be \nnegotiated for each project, with fees paid at the time of commercial close deemed to have met \ncost recovery objectives.  \n \n8.
