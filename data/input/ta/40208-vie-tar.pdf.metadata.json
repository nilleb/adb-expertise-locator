The Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam  requested assistance from the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) in building the capacity of Viet Nam Electricity (formerly known \nas Electricity of Viet Nam [EVN]) in environmental management of thermal power plants (TPP), \nincluding air quality management, in Quang Ninh Province. The advisory technical assistance \n(TA) was included in the country strategy and program 2007\u20132010.1 The TA is programmed for \nADB\u2019s 2007 TA program for Viet Nam.  The Fact-Finding Mission visited Viet Nam in March \n2007  and  reached  an  understanding  with  the  Government  on  the  objective,  scope,  cost \nestimates, counterpart financing, and implementation arrangements for the TA.2  \n \n2.  The TA will focus on strengthening EVN staff capacity in environmental management \nand adopting best environmental practices to ensure sustainable development of thermal power \nprojects in Viet Nam. The TA will also assist the Department of Environment and Natural \nResources (DONRE) of Quang Ninh Province in addressing air pollution problems due to power \ndevelopment and improving its capacity for managing air quality in the province.   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Viet  Nam\u2019s  rapid  economic  growth  of  7.5%  per  annum  over  the  past  decade  has \ncontributed to the Government\u2019s success in reducing the proportion of the population below the \npoverty line, from 58% in 1993 to 19% in 2006. The Government aims to maintain this level of \neconomic growth until 2010, and to further reduce poverty to 15%. With continued economic \ngrowth comes an estimated 16% per annum increase in power demand.  Any shortage in power \nis most likely to result in slower economic growth and underachievement of the the poverty \nreduction targets.  To address power demand requirements, the Government prepared the 6th \nPower  Development  Master  Plan  (PDMP).  The  plan  identifies  the  need  for  new  power \ngeneration,  transmission,  and  distribution  projects  to  be  implemented  to  meet  the  nation\u2019s \ngrowing power demands. To support the 6th PDMP, ADB and other development partners are \npreparing a major lending program to assist Viet Nam in meeting the power demand. For \ninstance, Mong Duong TPP in Quang Ninh and Song Bung IV hydropower plant are two \nprojects that are programmed for ADB financing in 2007. The country strategy and program for \nViet Nam, 2007\u20132010, incorporates the environment as a crosscutting theme and proposes \ninitiatives to assist in building the Government\u2019s capacity in environmental management to \nensure a sustainable high level of economic growth while at the same time providing financing \nsupport to the country\u2019s infrastructure development.    \n \n4.  Viet Nam\u2019s power system has a total installed capacity of 11,340 megawatts (MW), of \nwhich almost 78% or 8,822 MW is generated by EVN. Around 61% of EVN\u2019s installed capacity \nis with TPPs (coal-fired, oil-fired, and gas).3 EVN will continue to play a significant role in \nsupplying the country\u2019s power needs, even though in the Government\u2019s proposed power sector \nreforms, private sector ownership of power generation will increase to about 30% by 2011. The \ndaily operation of TPPs, especially those based on coal, has been contributing to environmental \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006. Viet Nam: Country Strategy and Program, 2007\u20132010. Manila. The title of the TA was Environmental \nManagement System at Electricity of Viet Nam in VIE CSP 2007\u20132010. During the TA Fact-Finding Mission, it was \nconcluded that local governments in the areas where thermal power plants are located need to be considered so \nas to ensure that the TA activities are comprehensive and responsive to the actual needs of environmental \nmanagement in power development. The TA title was thus revised to reflect the inclusion of a local government, \nQuang Ninh Province, in the TA activities. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 26 April 2007. \n3  EVN. 2007. Annual Report, 2005\u20132006. Hanoi. \n ", "2   \nproblems and deteriorating air quality and public health in both urban and rural areas due to air \nemissions, waste generation, and inefficiency of plant operation.4  \n \n5.  ADB\u2019s  country  environmental  analysis  for  Viet  Nam5 found  that  the  environmental \nproblems in existing TPPs were partly due to poor maintenance of equipment and out-of-date \ndesign and technology, and also to weak capacity and institutional systems for environmental \nmanagement.6 In recognition of these issues, EVN\u2019s management decided to introduce new \ncombustion technology and design for its new coal-fired TPPs so as to use cleaner technologies \nand achieve higher thermal efficiencies, and to incorporate environmental abatement equipment \nin project designs to minimize adverse environmental impacts. For instance, the Mong Duong \npower plant will use circulating fluidized bed technology to efficiently burn domestic coal. The \nproject is designed to ensure that emission standards for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and \nparticulate matter are complied with.7 Further, EVN has also decided that new coal-fired power \nplants to be built in central and southern Viet Nam will all use supercritical boiler technologies \nand burn imported coal. The innovations will improve power plant efficiencies to around 44%\u2013\n47% compared with the traditional thermal efficiencies of 35%\u201337%. EVN staff will need to be \ntrained in the use of these new technologies to maximize their environmental benefits. \n \n6.         To  further  address  environmental  issues  associated  with  power  development,  EVN \nestablished in 2005 a Science, Technology and Environment Department (STED) to provide \ncorporate-wide advice on environmental management. The actual design of pollution control \nequipment and environmental assessment for TPPs during the planning and design period are \ncarried  out  by  EVN\u2019s  power  engineering  and  consulting  companies  (PECCs).  The \nimplementation of environmental management plans during plant construction and operation \nrests  with  the  thermal  power  project  management  units  (TPPMU).  Experience  with  EVN\u2019s \nenvironmental management at various stages of power plant development has shown that the \ndesign  capacity  of  PECCs  and  implementation  capacity  of  TPPMUs  on  environmental \nmanagement are limited, and do not meet international standards. STED also lacks knowledge \nof best international practices in environmental management of TPPs, and so is not well-\nequipped to give adequate suggestions and support to the PECCs and TPPMUs during project \ndesign and implementation. Often the results are project delays. To improve the situation, \nadditional support to EVN is needed to strengthen its capacity for environmental management \nduring project design and implementation.8  \n \n7.  ADB has provided technical assistance to EVN in strategic environmental management \nand  environmental  management  for  hydropower  plant  development.9 The  Japan  Bank  for \nInternational Cooperation (JBIC) is also assisting EVN in developing a corporate environmental \n                                                 \n4  World Bank. 2002.

The proposed TA, intended to improve EVN\u2019s knowledge and technical \nskills in clean technology and pollution control practices for TPPs, is timely and complements \nJBIC\u2019s assistance to EVN.  \n \n8.  Coal-fired TPPs emit sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and fine particulates. \nSome of these power plants, such as Pha Lai TPP, Quang Ninh TPP, and the planned Mong \nDuong TPP, are located in northern Viet Nam, specifically in Quang Ninh Province, where coal \nreserves are huge. Coal-fired power plants are expected to eventually account for 22% of Viet \nNam\u2019s total installed generating capacity by 2015 and 34% by 2020. These coal-fired power \nplants usually compound the air quality issues by contributing to high levels of sulfur dioxide, \nnitrogen oxide, and particulate matter on top of the dust generated by mining activities, which \ncause air quality to deteriorate and affect the health of people living in the vicinity.  \n \n9.  Quang Ninh Province has the largest coal resources in Viet Nam. More than 100,000 \npeople are employed by the coal industry in the province, with many others employed in \nsubsidiary and service industries related to coal. Coal mining activities have been affecting air \nquality in the province. Air pollution is caused mainly by coal dust, which results from blasting in \nthe coal mines and the transporting of coal from the mines to coal processing plants, power \nplants, and ports. The suspended particulate matters, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and \ncarbon monoxide in Quang Ninh are already at serious levels. The United Nations Development \nProgramme conducted a study of the environmental issues of open-pit mining in Quang Ninh in \n1995, and identified a number of weaknesses in institutional capacity, which to date have not \nbeen adequately addressed. \n \n10.  To  improve  the  worsening  air  pollution  in  the  province,  the  Quang  Ninh  People\u2019s \nCommittee issued Order No. 1013 on 3 April 2006, which defined mitigation measures to be \nadopted to minimize air pollution caused by coal transportation. The Committee requested \nDONRE and the provincial police to strengthen law enforcement and to impose penalties for \nviolations. Also in 2006, the Committee approved a budget for DONRE to establish laboratory \nfacilities to improve air quality monitoring in the province. Quang Ninh DONRE acknowledges \nthat its staff lacks the necessary technical skills and knowledge in air quality monitoring and \nmanagement,  which  is  essential  for  it  to  monitor  the  implementation  of  environmental \nmanagement plans and pollution control measures of mining companies and power plants in the \nprovince. \n \n11.  Both EVN and Quang Ninh DONRE urgently need technical support in strengthening \ntheir capacity to plan and implement environmental management strategies, and to manage \nTPP air quality and related activities. The proposed TA will demonstrate to both EVN and \nQuang Ninh DONRE the best practices in environmental management, and pollution control and \nmonitoring in areas affected by a thermal power project and associated fuel exploitation and \ntransportation activities.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The purpose of the TA is to assist EVN and Quang Ninh Provincial DONRE in building \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \ntheir  capacity  to  manage  and  mitigate  environmental  risks  associated  with  thermal  power \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \nprojects in Viet Nam. The TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n \n ", "4   \n13.  The proposed TA will address environmental management associated with coal-fired \nTPPs through two components. The expected outcome of component 1 will be building within \nEVN  adequate  capacity  and  technical  knowledge  of  pollution  control  and  environmental \nmanagement  measures  associated  with  TPPs.  The  outcome  of  component  2  will  be  the \nstrengthened capability of Quang Ninh DONRE in air quality management. The expected results \nof  component  1  are  (i)  improved  knowledge  in  environmental  planning  and  management \nstrategies of staff in  TPPs of EVN, its associated institutions and organizations, including the \nTPPMUs, and PECCs; (ii) strengthened capacity of PECCs, TPPMUs, and TPPs in designing \nand  implementing  pollution  control  and  environmental  monitoring  measures;  (iii)  training \nmaterials including state-of-the-art knowledge and international best practices that can be used \nby EVN for its future training activities; and (iv) a medium-term capacity-building plan to sustain \nthe benefits of the TA activities. For component 2, the expected results are (i) strengthened \nQuang Ninh DONRE\u2019s capacity for managing air quality and controlling air pollution from TPPs \nand  mining  activities  in  the  province;  (ii) an  air  quality  management  plan  for Quang  Ninh \nProvince including action items, budget estimates, resource requirements, and implementation \nplan; and (iii) baseline data in air quality and public health monitoring in the vicinity of the Mong \nDuong TPP.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  Various methods such as desk reviews, field surveys, workshops, policy dialogues, and \nconsultations will be used to obtain the TA outputs.  The TA will be implemented over 12 \nmonths by a team of consultants.   \n \n15.  For component 1, EVN has selected Mong Duong TPPMU as the Implementing Agency \nfor  the  TA  activities.  TA  consultants  will  carry  out  these  major  activities:  (i)  assess  the \nweaknesses and strengths of EVN in implementing environmental management measures for \nTPPs, with particular focus on clean technology, pollution control equipment, and environmental \nmonitoring;  (ii)  considering  government  legislation,  corporate  policies,  and  development \npartners\u2019 environmental requirements, identify training needs in environmental management for \nEVN staff; (iii) prepare training materials, which will include, but will not be limited to, state-of-\nthe-art clean technology, international best practices on the use of pollution control equipment, \nand environmental monitoring of TPPs; (iv) organize training workshops for various levels of \nEVN staff; (v) organize an international training course for selected EVN staff in a facility similar \nto Mong Duong power plant in the Asia and Pacific region for the trainees to learn how state-of-\nart cleaner technology and environmental management practices in coal-fired power plants are  \nundertaken; (vi) prepare a medium-term capacity-building plan for environmental management \nfor EVN; and (vii) evaluate the effectiveness of the TA and suggest follow-up activities in a \nmedium-term capacity-building plan.   \n \n16.  For component 2, the TA consultants will (i) review and assess air pollution sources and \nmanagement  issues  in  Quang  Ninh  Province;  (ii)  assess  the  weaknesses  of  Quang  Ninh \nDONRE  in  establishing  baseline  data  and  monitoring  air  quality  and  related  public  health \nparameters; (iii) make site visits to open-pit coal mines and associated coal processing and \ntransportation activities, and assess the status of air pollution in those activities; (iv) establish \ntwo air quality stations in the impact zone of Mong Duong power plant  to collect baseline data; \n(v) collect baseline data on public health to be used for monitoring the incidence of respiratory \ndiseases in Mong Duong ward and Cam Hai commune in Cam Pha district, which are the \nimpact zones of the Mong Duong power complex; (vi) prepare an air quality management plan \nfor Quang Ninh Province through a participatory consultation process; and (vii) conduct training \nfor Quang Ninh DONRE and its district officials. Quang Ninh DONRE will hold stakeholder \n ", "    5  \nmeetings  with  district  officials  and  representatives  of  Cam  Pha  district  and  coal  mining \ncompanies, to solicit their views on the TA activities and planned outputs. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The TA total cost is estimated at $720,000 equivalent. The Government has requested \nADB to finance $600,000 equivalent. This amount will be financed on a grant basis by the \nGovernment of France and administered by ADB. The Government of Viet Nam will finance the \nremaining $120,000 equivalent through in-kind contribution. Detailed cost estimates and the \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  EVN will be the Executing Agency (EA) and TPPMU1 the Implementing Agency (IA) for \ncomponent 1, and Quang Ninh People\u2019s Committee will be the EA and Quang Ninh DONRE the \nIA for component 2. The TA will be implemented over  12 months, from  October 2007 to \nSeptember  2008,  and  will  require  a  total  of  38  person-months  of  consulting  services\u201415 \nperson-months international and 23 person-months national.  A consulting firm will be selected \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (February 2007, as amended \nfrom time to time). Resource persons will be engaged as lecturers on specific topics. The \nsimplified technical proposal procedure will be used for selecting the consulting firm on the \nquality- and-cost-based selection process at a quality-cost ratio of 80:20.
