Proposed Tax Reform \n \n \n ", " \nLOAN AND PROGRAM SUMMARY \n \nBorrower  Kingdom of Tonga \n \n  The Proposal  A loan is proposed for the Economic and Public Sector \nReform Program (EPSRP) to support reform measures in \npublic finance and the public service.   \nThe Program   \nRationale    The national strategic vision of the Kingdom of Tonga has \nas its key objective the attainment of a higher standard of \nliving for all Tongans. Achievement of this objective has \nbeen limited by low long-term economic growth rates, and \nby employment growth well below the rate of increase of \nthe  labor  force.  These  disappointing  outcomes  reflect \npolicy  and  governance  environments  that  have \ndiscouraged private sector investment, and the crowding- \nout effects of a relatively large public sector. Government \nfinances are deteriorating due to inadequate collection of \nnontax revenue, transfers to public sector enterprises, and \nunbudgeted  spending.  Wages  and  salaries  account  for \nover  57%  of  current  expenditure,  crowding  out \nexpenditures on goods, services, and investments.   \n \nVarious  changes  addressing  these  issues  have  already \ntaken  place,  which  are  in  line  with  the  prioritized \ndevelopment  objectives  and  policies  established  in  the \nSeventh  Strategic  Development  Plan,  2001-2003.  The \nGovernment  is  now  actively  seeking  to  accelerate  the \nreform process by implementing the EPSRP.  \n \nObjectives and Scope  The  objective  of  the  EPSRP  is  to  ensure  overall \nmacroeconomic  stability  and  to  contribute  to  enhanced \nprivate sector-led economic growth.   \n \nThe EPSRP comprises two main areas of reform: (i) fiscal \nreform measures aimed at achieving a sustainable fiscal \nbalance and (ii) public service reform measures seeking to \nimprove public service delivery to the private sector and the \ngeneral public.  \n \nClassification  Economic Growth \nGood Governance \n \nEnvironmental   Category C    \nAssessment  The  environmental  implications  of  the  Program  are \nminimal.  \n \n \n ", "iv   \nADB Assistance   \n \nA.   Program Loan   \n \n  Loan Amount  It  is  proposed  that  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \n  and Terms  support the Government\u2019s policy reforms by providing a \nloan  of  SDR  8,020,000  (US$10  million  equivalent)  from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. The loan will have a  24- \nyear term including a grace period of 8 years, an interest \nrate of 1% per annum during the grace period, and 1.5% \nthereafter. \n \n      Program Period The Program period will be 20 months. The loan will be \n        and Tranching  released in two tranches of equal size. The first tranche will \nbe made available upon loan effectiveness. The second \ntranche  is  expected  to  be  released  by  March  2003, \ndepending  upon  satisfactory  implementation  of  agreed \nupon conditions.  \n \n   Executing Agency  Ministry of Finance \n \n    Procurement  The proceeds of the loan are expected to be disbursed \nagainst a broad range of imports, subject to a negative list \nof items. Procurement of goods will be based on normal \ncommercial practices for procurement by the private sector \nor  standard  government  procurement  procedures \nacceptable to ADB for procurement by the public sector, \nexcept  that  in  the  case  of  goods  commonly  traded  on \ninternational  commodities  markets,  procurement  will  be \nundertaken in accordance with procedures appropriate to \nthe trade and acceptable to ADB.  \n \n    Counterpart Funds  Counterpart funds to be generated from the proceeds of \nthe loan will be used to finance local currency costs related \nto the implementation of the Program.  \n \nB.   Technical Assistance  Technical assistance (TA) in the amount of US$700,000 for \nBuilding a Performance-Based Public Service will provide \nadvisory  services  and  support  capacity  building  to  (i) \nfacilitate  good  governance  practices  and  strengthen  the \nplanning,  monitoring,  and  reporting  capability  of  the \nministries;  (ii)  establish  the  central  human  resource \nmanagement  information  system;  (iii)  introduce \nperformance accountability for heads of departments; (iv) \nsupport the introduction of performance-oriented and merit-\nbased remuneration policies and procedures; and (v) assist \nin  the  preparation  of  regulations  and  implementation \nguidelines  for new legislation under the EPSRP. The TA \nwill be financed by ADB on a grant basis from the ADB-\nfunded TA program. It is estimated that about 28 person-\nmonths of international consulting services will be required. \n \n ", "  v\nThe consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants.  \n \nRisks and Safeguards  The  successful  implementation  of  reform  will  require \nconsiderable political will to (i) delegate an increased share \nof management responsibilities to government departments \nwithin the reform framework; and (ii) create a transparent, \nconsistent,  and  responsive  policy  environment.  To  date, \nsuch risks have been mitigated by the strong commitment \nof most senior government officials to push through the key \npolicy reforms. It is also important to note that the reform \nprogram is strongly supported by the Privy Council. The \nPrime Minister and the minister of finance, both appointed \nwith the endorsement of the Privy Council, were selected \nbecause of their recognized commitment to reform, which \nindicates that the proposed reforms are supported by the \nhighest authorities in the country.  \n \nAnother risk is that the Government may lack the capacity \nand  management  resources  to  implement  some  of  the \nimportant  reform  measures,  despite  strong  political  will. \nThis risk will be mitigated by ADB\u2019s TA as well as TA from \nother funding agencies.  In addition, at least 20% of the \ncounterpart  funds  have  been  earmarked  to  mitigate  the \nimpacts of the public service reform. \n \n \n ", "vi   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed \nloan to the Kingdom of Tonga for the Economic and Public Sector Reform Program (EPSRP). \nThe Report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Building a Performance-\nBased Public Service, and if the proposed loan is approved by the Board, I, acting under the \nauthority delegated to me by the Board, shall approve the TA.  \n \nII.  INTRODUCTION \n2.  Discussions  between  the  Government  of  the  Kingdom  of  Tonga  and  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  on  developing  the  EPSRP  have  been  ongoing  since  1998.  In \nresponse  to  the  Government's  request  for  TA1  to  formulate  the  proposed  EPSRP,  ADB \nsubmitted a draft concept paper, including the institutional framework for EPSRP management, \nto the Government in August 1999. The Cabinet of Ministers approved the draft concept paper \nin  April  2000.  The  Prime  Minister  reiterated  the  Government\u2019s  commitment  to  the  reform \nprogram in a public statement made in June 2001. The TA to prepare the EPSRP and to \nfacilitate the initial stage of implementation commenced in September 2001. A consultation \nmission  was  fielded  during  15-20  October  2001,  and  a  fact-finding  mission  during  24 \nNovember\u20138 December 2001, followed by a preappraisal mission during 21-26 January 2002.2 \nIn preparation for the EPSRP, the Cabinet approved  a number of submissions, including all of \nthose designated as first tranche conditions, on 23 January 2002.3  \n \n3.  All reform measures have been in preparation for an extended period of 1-4 years. \nMoving  forward  now  is  spurred  by  a  number  of  factors\u2014a  worsening  fiscal  situation, \ndisappointing economic growth, and the eroded Tonga Trust Fund\u2014which have led to  a \nspecific \u201cmacroeconomic moment\u201d where macroeconomic vulnerability creates not just a need \nfor borrowing but an increased understanding of the need for reform. The Government has \ntaken the initiative to compile these reform measures into a coherent  reform program, and has \nestablished an organizational structure and a secretariat to ensure its implementation.  The \nprogram logical framework (Appendix 1) and the draft policy matrix (Appendix 2) are a result of \nthese  efforts  and  were  discussed  with  senior  government  officials,  private  sector \nrepresentatives, and other key stakeholders. Focus group discussions, hearings and workshops \ninvolving  civil  society  were  organized,  are  still  ongoing,  and  will  continue  during  the \nimplementation of the EPSRP. The program logical framework and the policy matrix outline the \ncontent of the EPSRP, which forms part of the Government\u2019s overall reform program. The \ncomprehensive policy agenda and reform priorities of the Government go beyond the EPSRP \nand are summarized in the development policy letter (DPL) from the minister of finance found in \nAppendix 3.  \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2001.

The Cabinet also discussed a report prepared by the Pacific Financial Technical \nAssistance Centre (PFTAC) on  proposed tax reforms. The minister of finance received the requested approval \nfrom Cabinet to (i) undertake wider consultations on the implications of the proposed tax reforms; and (ii) to \ncommence drafting  the necessary legislation. ", "2   \nIII.  THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \nA.  Background and Recent Economic Performance \n    \n4.  The Tongan economy grew at an average annual rate of 1.8% during 1973-1995, with \nper capita gross domestic product (GDP) growth at 1.2%. The engine of growth was remittances \nfrom Tongan workers overseas.4 Real government spending also grew strongly. Real GDP grew \nat an average annual rate of 2.2% in the 7-year period from 30 June 1994 to 30 June 2001; but \ngrowth rates ranged from - 0.2% (FY1996) to 6.2% (FY2000). The budget statement for FY2002 \nobserved that the average annual growth for FY1998-FY2000 was estimated at 6.1% in nominal \nterms  and  4.4%  in  real  terms.  This  performance  represents  a  marked  recovery  from  the \nrecession over the FY1996-FY1997 period, when minimal growth was recorded. The turnaround \nin FY2000 was attributed largely to growth in the services sector (5.6%) supported by recovery \nin  the  agriculture  and  fishery  sector,  which  grew  by  10.8%.  The  impact  of  millennium \ncelebrations was a feature of this period, with a 17.9% growth rate in the commerce, restaurant, \nand hotel sectors. Government administration and community services became the largest \nsector in the monetary economy by the turn of the 21st  century, growing at an average annual \nrate of 5.0%, and accounting for 15.3% of GDP in FY2001. This sector was a major contributor \nto growth through the 1990s and into the new millennium. Economic indicators suggest that \nGDP growth for FY2001 is likely to be in the order of 6% in nominal terms and 3% in real terms. \nThe anticipated real growth in GDP in FY2002 was projected in June 2001 as 3% with some \npotential for improvement.5 \n   \n5.  However, the forecast for FY2002 was revised downward in December 2001 to 1.5% as \na result of deteriorating world economic conditions. The impact of tropical cyclone Waka that \ndevastated the northern island group of Vava\u2019u and the Niuas on 31 December 2001 would \nlower this further. Workers\u2019 remittances contribute about half of Tonga\u2019s foreign exchange \nearnings, and about 60% of these flows come from thousands of Tongans living in the United \nStates. In addition, disruption to international air services has diminished fresh fish exports to \nHawaii. There will be negative effects on government revenue as expenditure for imported \ngoods is affected by these developments. It is also clear that short-term reform measures for \nincreasing revenues and reducing expenditures that had been foreseen in June-July 2001 will \nnot have much impact in FY2002.  \n \n6.  Government finances deteriorated from a fiscal deficit of 0.2% of GDP in FY1999, to 0.4 \n% in FY2000 and 2.6% in FY2001 (Figure 1). The fiscal rule that recurrent expenditure should \nnot exceed recurrent revenue was adhered to, but led to a reduction in nonwage expenditures \nto accommodate the increasing wage bill. With the 20% public service wage increase in 2000, \nwages and salaries now account for over 57% of current expenditure, crowding out expenditure \non other goods and services and limiting the availability of domestic resources for investment. \nDisappointing collection of nontax revenue, transfers to public sector enterprises (PSEs), and \nunbudgeted spending, including a loan to the national airline, caused total public expenditure to \nrun ahead of budget estimates for FY2002. In addition, there is an estimated T$30 million \nunfunded liability arising from the public servants\u2019 retirement scheme introduced in 1999. Until \nmid-2001 the Government drew resources from the Tonga Trust Fund6 to cover any emerging \n                                                 \n4   Per capita growth would have been minimal if not for continued outward migration.   \n5 The International Monetary Fund in its staff report for the 2001 Article IV consultation, largely agreed with this \nassessment of recent economic performance and the outlook for FY2002, but cautioned that reform and fiscal \nrestraint are a precondition for this relatively favorable scenario. \n6 An off-budget fund established in 1988 to hold proceeds from the former sale of passports to Tongan protected \npersons. The resources were intended to be used for special development projects and to mitigate natural \n \n ", "  3\nbudget deficit and unbudgeted expenditures. This financial cushion allowed fiscal discipline to \ndeteriorate. It also reduced the felt need to proceed with long-discussed economic and public \nsector reform measures. However, due to poor performance of the trust fund, this fallback \noption is no longer available. The budget deficit that originally was estimated to be TS$6.7 \nmillion in FY2002 may approach TS$10 million and is financed by the  domestic banking \nsystem. The rise in net credit to the Government and an expansion in credit to the private sector \neroded foreign reserves to US$15.3 million at the end of June 2001, or approximately 2 months \nof import cover, placing pressure on the currency pa\u2019anga.  \n \nFigure 1: Government Budget, FY1992-FY2002\n40 Total revenue and grants (%\n35 of GDP)\n30 Total expenditure (% of GDP)\n25\n20 Current balance (% of GDP)\n15\n10 Overall balance (% of GDP)\n5\n0\n-5\n-10\nGDP=gross domestic product. \nSource: International Monetary Fund. 1997, 1998, 2001. \u201cStaff Report for the Article IV \nConsultation.\u201d Washington D.C. \n \n7.  The inflation rate between June 1985 and June 1995 varied around an average of 8.6%.  \nAs a result of expansionary macroeconomic policies and substantial currency depreciation, \ndrought and cyclone damage, and higher world prices, inflation went from 5.25% in FY2000 to \n7.0% in FY2001 and is expected to grow above 10% in FY2002. Broad money increased by \n8.3% in FY2000 and by an estimated 35.7% in FY2001. The latter increase was driven by a \n35.1% rise in net domestic assets. Net credit to the Government rose more than fivefold in line \nwith the financing of the fiscal deficit, and credit to nonfinancial PSEs more than doubled, while \ncredit to the private sector grew by around 23.8%. Net foreign assets declined. Monetary policy \nwas tightened in early FY2001 in response to declining foreign reserves, with the National \nReserve Bank of Tonga (NRBT) raising the reserve requirement ratio from 12% to 15% and the \nminimum lending rate from 9% to 12%. The Privy Council also approved credit ceilings in July \n2000. However, monetary policy eased during the latter half of the current FY 2002.  \n \n8.  The external accounts were characterized by large trade deficits throughout the 1990s, \nlarge net private transfer flows, and a negative current account balance that often reflected \nforeign borrowing to finance public investment projects. The decline in official foreign reserves \nduring the decade and the concomitant drop in import cover are striking features during this \n                                                                                                                                                          \ndisasters. The fund was invested almost entirely offshore and by 1998 was reported to have reached T$33.5 \nmillion. The fund has since been severely depleted. The Government has commenced an investigation into the \nfund, the results of which are expected to be available shortly.    \n \n ", "4   \nperiod. In FY2001 the balance of payments deteriorated further. The net services account \nmoved from surplus to deficit, reflecting a decline in tourism receipts, a rise in transportation \ncosts, and the impact of payments by the telecommunications sector. The current account \ndeficit consequently rose by approximately 2 percentage points of GDP. Gross official foreign \nreserves in mid-2001 covered less than 2 months of imports of goods and services\u2014well below \nNRBT\u2019s target of at least 3 months. Since July 2000, the pa\u2019anga has been pegged to a basket \nof currencies that includes the Japanese yen in addition to the United States (US), Australian, \nand New Zealand dollars. Most of the currency devaluation followed the private sector credit \nexpansion  of  FY1998  and  the  subsequent  loss  of  foreign  reserves.  Further  depreciation \noccurred in FY2001 as the current account position weakened: 21% against the US dollar, \n6.75% in nominal effective terms, and approximately 5.5% in real effective terms. \n \n9.  Tonga has enjoyed relatively buoyant growth in recent years at least partly as a result of \nan  expansionary  fiscal  and  monetary  policy.  However,  the  country  now  faces  balance  of \npayments  difficulties  and  rising  inflation.  Both  of  these  threats  are  serious,  and  neither  is \nsusceptible to a short-term solution. Even in the face of severe restraint, foreign exchange \nreserves would take some time to recover from the current situation of less than 2 months of \nimport cover to a more comfortable 4-6 months, which was the case in the past. Inflation will put \nfurther pressure on an overstretched budget. The most immediate of these pressures will likely \nbe for further adjustments to the public service wage scale, which was adjusted upwards by \n20% in FY2001. Virtually the whole of this increase will have been offset by inflation by the end \nof the current fiscal year. \n \n10.  It is fair to say that the existence of the Tonga Trust Fund and remittances from Tongan \noverseas workers have masked  economic reality in Tonga for a long time. That reality is \nsluggish growth, a public sector that is large in relation to the economy, and heavy dependence \non the Government for job creation. Reform is needed to address these structural problems \nwhile remittances still continue to underpin a weak domestic economy. \n \nB.  Macroeconomic Issues and Prospects \n \n11.  At the time of its annual Article IV consultation in June 2001, the International Monetary \nFund (IMF) was critical of the expansionary fiscal and monetary policies pursued in FY2001. \nThe overall fiscal deficit for FY2001 was then estimated at 2% of GDP and now stands at 1.5%. \nIt was also observed that despite a rise in the reserve requirement from 12% to 15% in \nSeptember 2000, excess liquidity, coupled with the low interest paid on NRBT short-term bills, \nhad facilitated strong credit expansion by banks. IMF prescriptions stressed the importance of \nfiscal and monetary tightening and early implementation of corresponding measures to regain \nexternal viability. \n \n12.  Economic growth in FY2002 is unlikely to come up to expectations established before \nthe events of 11 September 2001 and before the extent of the world economic slowdown \nbecame evident. Remittances are vulnerable to the shock of possible job losses in the ranks of \nexpatriate Tongans.  Imports will decline should there be lower remittances, and consequently \ngovernment revenues, which are largely import related, will fall. Exports of niche agricultural \nproducts may be affected, and some bank assets weakened. \n \n13.  The leisurely pace of reform in recent years is no longer compatible with the reality that \nfiscal balance has been lost and monetary policy has few effective instruments at its disposal. It \nshould be stressed that these endemic problems are structural rather than cyclical. There are \ntwo principal structural problems: \n \n ", "  5\n   \n(i)  The Government has been active in almost every field of economic endeavor. In \naddition to public utilities, communications, and transportation (both marine and \nair), the Government is involved in fishing, tourism, retail trade, and many other \naspects of economic life that are not normally regarded as traditional areas of \ngovernment activity even in small economies. It is essential that these activities \nbe rationalized by closure, divestiture, or corporatization in order to stem losses \nor recycle resources into more productive uses. This will take considerable time, \nsince almost none of these endeavors are saleable in their present form, and \nchanges  will  involve  disruption  of  established  patterns  of  employment  and \neconomic activity that underpin the social sector. Moreover, capital markets are \nvirtually non-existent in Tonga, so privatization will involve foreign ownership or a \nlong wait until the State can realize its investment. \n \n(ii)  The Government has become the largest employer by far, with nearly 5,000 paid \npositions accounting for over one third of total paid employment. Employment in \nPSEs adds nearly another 2,000 employees and raises the total government \nshare of paid employment to about 45%. This level of employment has meant \nthat  budgetary  restraint  has  bitten  more  deeply  into  nonwage  and  salary \noperating costs so that the relatively large government labor force is not provided \nwith adequate funds to be effective in all cases. Wages and salaries now account \nfor over 57% of government operating costs net of debt service. Rebalancing is \nclearly needed. \n \n14.  These two structural problems continue to place a heavy burden on the government \nbudget, a situation that has become untenable. Given the unsatisfactory collection of tax and \nnontax revenue due to legislative loopholes and a weak revenue administration, government \nrevenue falls far below what it should amount to.  \n \n15.  Until recently these structural issues were not perceived as actual problems.  It is only \nnow, with the worsening fiscal situation, disappointing economic growth, and eroded Tonga \nTrust Fund, that addressing these structural problems has become a priority. Economic and \npublic sector reforms are now fundamental to Tonga\u2019s prospects for economic growth in the \nyears ahead. Unlike the governments of other Pacific developing member countries (PDMCs), \nthe Government of Tonga has a stable political climate, and to this extent has an advantage in \nbeing able to see a reform program through.  \n \nC.  Government Objectives and Strategy \n \n16.  The Government of Tonga\u2019s development objectives and strategy are presented in the \ncabinet-approved Seventh Strategic Development Plan, 2001-2003 (SSDP). The Plan identifies \na sustained rise in living standards as the overall development objective, with living standards \ndefined in terms of both income and human development levels. The basic means of achieving \nthis development objective is durable economic growth, which generates economic benefits that \nare shared equitably and permits higher expenditure on education and health. More specifically, \nthe Plan aims to promote (i) a well-educated and skilled labor force; (ii) efficient, well-structured \nPSEs; (iii) a sound enabling environment for private sector-led economic growth; (iv) an efficient \nand  well-structured  government  sector;  (v)  well-maintained  physical  infrastructure;  (vi) \nconservation of the environment and efficient use of renewable resources; (vii) participation of \ncivil  society  and  the  community  in  economic  development;  (viii) equitable  distribution  of \n \n ", "6   \ndevelopment  benefits;  (ix)  low  crime  rate  and  enhanced  national  security;  and  (x) stable \nmacroeconomic environment. \n \n17.  The Government  acknowledges that, for durable growth to occur, the bulk of investment \nshould occur in the private sector of a market economy in which the Government will play a \nnumber of crucial, complementary roles. These roles are providing a stable macroeconomic \nenvironment,  promoting  education  and  technology,  investing  in  physical  and  institutional \ninfrastructure, providing a social safety net for vulnerable groups, and preventing environmental \ndegradation. Therefore, the SSDP gives top priority for funding purposes to a restructuring \nprogram that is designed to (i) make the Tongan economy more competitive and dynamic, (ii) \nfacilitate and promote the growth of the private sector, (iii) rationalize and raise the efficiency of \nthe Government and public sector enterprises, and  (iv) mobilize domestic saving to raise self- \nreliance in financing investments. The Government\u2019s overall reform agenda, as outlined in the \nDPL, comprises four reform areas: (i) fiscal reform, (ii) public sector reform, (iii) financial sector \nreform, and (iv) private sector reform. While the EPSRP focuses on fiscal and public sector \nreform, the Government will also implement the following additional reform measures.  \n \n18.  The  objective  of  the  financial  sector  reform  is  to  improve  overall  financial  sector \nperformance by (i) improving the effectiveness of monetary policy and management, and (ii) \nenhancing financial intermediation of the Tonga Development Bank. The SSDP identifies two \nmain issues that must be addressed if monetary policy is to better contribute to the maintenance \nof macroeconomic stability. The first is NRBT\u2019s weak balance sheet, which currently prevents \nthe effective use of indirect monetary policy instruments.7 The second issue concerns the need \nto strengthen NRBT\u2019s supervisory capacity in line with the provisions of the Financial Institutions \nAct  of  1991  and  subsequent  amendments,  in  order  to  ensure  adequate  enforcement  of \nprudential regulations covering all financial institutions. In accordance with a cabinet decision of \n23 January 2002, NRBT is responsible for implementation of the financial sector reform and will \nset up a reform team under the reform secretariat. \n \n19.  Acceleration  of  private  sector-led  economic  growth\u2014the  objective  of  policy  reforms \naimed at encouraging private sector growth\u2014will be addressed through (i) improving the legal \nand regulatory framework for local and foreign investment, and (ii) introducing and progressively \nimplementing tax reform. The keys to promoting private sector development are transparency \nand predictability of the business climate. This depends on replacing the discretionary powers of \nbureaucrats and ministers in regard to  business licensing with a clear statement of policy and \nstreamlined procedures. A new foreign investment act has been drafted with assistance from \nthe Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS), and will be introduced into the Legislative \nAssembly in the 2002 session. The business climate will also benefit from the removal of \nambiguity and discretion in matters such as the granting of work and residence visas. Reform \nmeasures  in  support  of  private  sector  development  include  (i)  formulation  of  a  national \ninvestment policy, including the determination of sectors in which foreign investors can invest; \n(ii) passage of the new foreign investment act; (iii) repeal of import licenses and the  Industrial \nDevelopment Incentives Act with clear transitional provisions; and (iv) review of land lease \nregulations.   \n \n                                                 \n7  When NRBT was established in 1989, the net foreign assets position was transferred from the Bank of Tonga by \nissuing NRBT bills. In the absence of financial support from the Ministry of Finance and with a gradual loss of \nforeign reserves, NRBT\u2019s income position worsened to the point where it stopped issuing 3-month bills in 1998, \nretaining only 1-month bills on which below-market rates are paid. \n \n ", "  7\n20.  Tax  reform  is  also  considered  important  by  the  business  community  and  by  the \nGovernment. Proposed changes would reduce the tax burden on businesses in part through \neliminating the discrimination in the Industrial Development Incentives Act by repealing it and \nreplacing it with lower rates on crucial business inputs while transferring the burden of taxation \naway from investment to consumption. These measures would be buttressed by fiscal reform, \nwhich will both reduce the \u201ccrowding out\u201d of business borrowing by government borrowing and \nreduce the extent of government involvement in the market by closing loss-incurring enterprises \nand offering to privatize commercial interests. The Ministry of Labor, Commerce and Industries \nis  taking  the  lead  in  implementing  these  reform  measures  in  support  of  private  sector \ndevelopment. \n \nD.  External Assistance and Roles of Major Funding Agencies \n \n21.  ADB has been among the major providers of external assistance to Tonga. Other major \nsources include the European Union (EU), World Bank, Australian Agency for International \nDevelopment (AusAID), and New Zealand\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT).  \nProject-based assistance is also provided by the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC) and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). EU assistance has focused on \ninfrastructure development in the Vava\u2019u island group, and the World Bank\u2019s program is focused \non human resource development in the health sector. AusAID\u2019s assistance is concentrated on \nhuman  resource  development  and  institutional  strengthening  in  health,  public  expenditure \nmanagement, the legal sector, and fisheries. MFAT assistance focuses on human resource \ndevelopment, outer island and community development, private sector development, and public \nenterprise reform. PRC assistance is in the education sector and JICA supports water supply \ninfrastructure development. \n \n22.  The Government requested ADB to play a leadership role in the design and coordination \nof  external  assistance  for  the  EPSRP.  This  involves  organization  of  a  consultative  group \nmeeting in mid-April 2002, and ensuring effective ongoing coordination among the various \nexternal assistance agencies. AusAID and MFAT are currently providing complementary TA in \nsupport  of  the  proposed  reform  program.  AusAID\u2019s  TA  aims  to  strengthen  the  Ministry  of \nFinance (MOF) in program budgeting and revenue generation. Continuous staff training for the \nRevenue Department forms part of AusAID\u2019s assistance. In addition, MOF requested two full-\ntime advisors on customs and tax administration, who will commence their assignment in June \n2002. AusAID is also providing TA to the Ministry of Justice to improve its management and \nadministrative functions. In addition to the present AusAID country allocation, resources for \nreform initiatives can be made available on request.  \n \n23.  The Government Investment Unit of MOF is assisted by TA from MFAT and addresses \npublic enterprise reform including privatization/corporatization. This TA commenced in mid-1999 \nwith short-term advisory inputs. As a result of the renewed impetus for the overall reform \nprogram, the TA was recently increased. MFAT is also providing TA on public service reform, \nspecifically in regard to the creation of a public service commission. As part of MFAT\u2019s TA \nreview of the education sector, consideration will be given to training needs for retired and \nretrenched public servants.  \n \n24.  The Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC) has completed a review of \nthe current taxation system and has prepared a comprehensive tax reform proposal, which has \nbeen discussed with key stakeholders in Tonga. On 23 January 2002, the Cabinet approved the \ndrafting of the required legislation and authorized wider consultations to be conducted. On \nrequest of the Government, PFTAC will design a strategy and implementation timetable to \n \n ", "8   \nenhance the effectiveness of revenue administration in support of the tax reform. PFTAC will \nalso provide assistance in legal drafting of the required tax and customs legislation with a view \nto strengthening tax administration and enforcing compliance in customs, sales, and income tax.  \n \n25.  An assessment of administrative barriers to private sector investments is being carried \nout by FIAS and ADB.8 Tonga was selected as a pilot country because of the EPSRP and the \nurgent need to facilitate private sector development in parallel with public sector reforms. A \nreview of the foreign investment regime was carried out by FIAS and resulted in a draft foreign \ninvestment act with additional support provided by AusAID. The TA team (footnote 1) has \nprepared drafts for a public finance management act, an audit act, and a public  enterprises act. \nA draft of the public service act will be prepared after recommendations on the establishment of \na public service commission have been reviewed by Cabinet (para. 23). Legislation on tax and \ncustoms administration will be drafted with assistance from PFTAC. The TA team works closely \nwith AusAID and MFAT advisors to enhance complementarity and to ensure consistency of \nadvice as well as to avoid duplication of tasks.  \n \nE.  ADB\u2019s Operation and Strategy \n \n1.  Past Performance \n \n26.  ADB has approved 14 loans from the Asian Development Fund, totaling US$42.9 million, \nto Tonga since it joined ADB in 1972. This includes the most recent loan approved in December \n1996 for the power sector which was cancelled in 1998 for its  failure to become effective. \nProject  completion  reports  have  been  prepared  for  all  projects,  9  of  which  have  been \npostevaluated. Of the nine postevaluated projects, eight were rated generally successful and \none project9 in the finance sector was rated partly successful. Since 1972, a total of US$11.4 \nmillion has been provided for 46 TAs. Implementation of a number of loan projects has been \nconstrained by insufficient availability of counterpart funds, weak project management, and \ndelays  of  loan  effectiveness  and  procurement  of  goods  and  services.  These  have  been \naddressed through (i) the introduction of project performance management systems, and (ii) the \nGovernment\u2019s confirmation of the projects\u2019 firm anchorage in the national development plans.  \n \n27.  In 1992, ADB informed the Government that a stronger emphasis would be given to \neconomic, sector, and policy analysis. For programming, this meant increased attention to the \nmacroeconomic policy environment, the investment climate, and public sector performance. \nSubsequently,  some  TAs  were  implemented  that  reflect  this  change  of  ADB\u2019s  country \noperational focus. Progress has been slow in implementing any reform activities emanating from \nthese TAs carried out since 1992.10  As a consequence, ADB\u2019s future lending and TA program \nwas made contingent on the Government\u2019s willingness to undertake reforms. ADB has not \nprogrammed new loans in Tonga since 1996 pending discussions with the Government on its \nreform directions.11  \n \n                                                 \n8  ADB.  2000.

Upon \nresolution of these issues, the Government requested ADB to resume its assistance with support for the EPSRP.    \n \n ", "  9\n28.  Lessons learned from these TAs include (i) the need to integrate existing disparate \nreform measures in the various areas related to the EPSRP, both from the Government and aid \nagencies; (ii) greater emphasis on aid coordination; (iii) greater involvement of the Government \nstarting from the design stage of TAs and projects to ensure its ownership; and (iv) less \nexternally driven reform agendas.12 These lessons have been incorporated in the process of \npreparing the EPSRP, and in ensuring a high level of aid coordination and cooperation (paras. \n21-25).   \n \n2.  Future Operations \n \n29.  ADB\u2019s Pacific Strategy for the New Millennium13 focuses on five broad objectives for its \nPDMCs:  (i)  continuing  support  for  economic,  governance,  and  public  sector  reform;  (ii) \npromoting private sector development; (iii) promoting a more active role of women in the social, \neconomic, and political spheres; (iv) supporting sustainable environmental management; and (v) \nsupporting  poverty  reduction  as  a  unifying  theme.  To  achieve  these  objectives,  ADB  will \ncontinue to assist in strengthening the capacity for governance, economic management, and \npublic  services;  improving  the  development  of  physical  and  information  technology \ninfrastructure;  strengthening  financial  sector  management;  and  supporting  the  role  of  civil \nsociety.  This regional strategy for the Pacific is the guiding instrument for the country strategy \nfor Tonga (and also other PDMCs).  It is supported by the economic report under preparation.14 \n \n30.  The Government\u2019s development strategy is expressed in its SSDP. The strategy aims at a \nhigher quality of life and standard of living for all Tongans; cultural evolution, individual fulfillment, \nand gender equity; and political and economic stability. In support of its strategic development \nplan, the Government is engaging in a comprehensive program of economic and public sector \nreforms, which is viewed as essential to achieve the objectives of economic growth and social \nequity. ADB\u2019s strategy of assistance to Tonga supports the Government\u2019s development strategy \nand reform measures. Assistance to the EPSRP is the cornerstone of ADB\u2019s program for Tonga in \nthe next 3 years. Expansion of ADB\u2019s assistance to other sectors is conditional on the return of \nmacroeconomic stability. \n \nIV.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Background and Rationale \n   \n31.  The national strategic vision of Tonga has as its key objective the attainment of a higher \nstandard of living for all Tongans. Achievement of this objective has been limited by a low long-\nterm economic growth rate, and by employment growth well below the rate of increase of the \nlabor force. The situation reflects policy and governance environments that have discouraged \nprivate  sector  investment,  and  the  crowding-out  effects  of  a  relatively  large  public  sector. \nConsiderable efforts by ADB and bilateral aid agencies in the past to support reforms yielded \ndisappointing results, which were attributed to lack of political will. However, while this situation \nhas  created  a  lot  of  skeptics  about  Tonga,  it  also  highlights  the  importance  of  the  right \nmacroeconomic  moment,  where  macroeconomic  vulnerability  creates  not  just  a  need  for \nborrowing  but  an  increased  understanding  of  the  need  for  reforms  and  the  willingness  to \n                                                 \n12 These lessons were summarized in the completion report for TA 2528-TON: Improved Budget System and \nEconomic Management dated 29 June 1999. The completion report also recommended that ADB proceed with the \npreparation of a TA for the EPSRP.  \n13 ADB. 2000. Pacific Strategy for the New Millennium. Manila \n14 A Pacific Island economic report for Tonga was prepared under a small-scale TA 3430-TON: Preparation of an \nEconomic Report, for US$124,000, approved on 24 April 2000.  \n \n ", "10  \nimplement them. Moving forward now is spurred by a number of factors\u2014a worsening fiscal \nsituation, disappointing economic growth, and the eroded Tonga Trust Fund. These factors \nwere  preceded  by  other  significant  changes.  In  January  2000,  the  reform-minded  Prince \nUlukalala Lavaka Ata was appointed Prime Minister. In January 2001, the King appointed a \nsimilarly reform-minded minister of finance, who continues to also hold the position of Acting \nGovernor of NRBT. Both are strong advocates of reform and have taken the lead responsibility \nfor the EPSRP. It is also important to note that the reform program is strongly supported by the \nPrivy  Council.15  The  Prime  Minister  and  the  minister  of  finance,  both  appointed  with  the \nendorsement of the Privy Council, were selected because of their recognized commitment to \nreform. Over the past two years, the Privy  Council has approved several policy measures to \nimprove  the  governance  of  PSEs  and  to  lay  the  groundwork  for  their  corporatization  and \nprivatization. These developments indicate that the highest authorities in the country support the \nproposed reforms. The various changes that have already taken place are in line with the \nprioritized development objectives and policies established in the SSDP. Now, and not least \nbecause of the tightening fiscal situation, the Government is actively seeking to accelerate the \nreform process by implementing the EPSRP. \n \nB.  Objectives and Scope \n \n32.   The objective of the EPSRP is to ensure overall macroeconomic stability and to contribute \nto enhanced private sector-led economic growth. Preconditions for reaching this objective are (i) \nachieving a sustainable fiscal balance, and (ii) improving the efficiency and effectiveness of \nservice delivery by the public sector.  \n \n33.  The Government\u2019s overall reform program comprises four main areas of reform: (i) fiscal \nreform, (ii) public service reform, (iii) financial sector reform, and (iv) private sector reform. The \nEPSRP focuses on two of these reform areas: (i) fiscal reform measures aimed at achieving a \nsustainable  fiscal  balance  through  (a)  strengthening  public  expenditure  management,  (b) \nenhancing revenue generation, and (c) improving the efficiency and effectiveness of resource \nuse in the public enterprise sector; and (ii) public service reform measures that seek to improve \npublic service delivery to the private sector and the general public by means of (a) establishing \nthe institutional framework for a performance-oriented public service, and (b) promoting efficient \nand effective performance management.  \n    \n34.  The  EPSRP,  through  these  two  reform  areas,  will  build  the  legal  and  regulatory \nframework and the institutional capacity to achieve macroeconomic stability and, combined with \nfinancial sector and private sector reform, to contribute to accelerated economic growth.  \n \nC.  Policy Framework and Actions \n \n1.  Ensuring Sustainable Fiscal Balance \n35.  The approach to achieving sustainable fiscal balance includes (i) strengthening public \nexpenditure management, (ii) enhancing revenue generation, and (iii) improving the efficiency and \n                                                 \n15 Tonga is a constitutional monarchy. The legislature,  executive, and  judiciary are separated.  The King appoints \nthe members of the Privy Council, which comprises members of the Cabinet and the Governors of Vava\u2019u and \nHa\u2019apai. The Legislative Assembly is composed of the members of the Cabinet, the Privy Councilors as well as \nrepresentatives of the nobles and of the people. The 33 nobles elect 9 among themselves to the Legislative \nAssembly and the people vote for 9 representatives. The members of Tonga's Human Rights and Democracy \nMovement, although not a formal political party, took seven of the nine parliamentary seats open to commoners in \nthe election in March 2002. \n \n ", "  11\neffectiveness of resource use in the PSEs. Sustainable fiscal balance requires changes in both \nlegislation and procedures as well as capacity building in key government agencies. Legislation is \nrequired in the area of public finance, audit, governance of PSEs, tax administration and policy, \nand  public  service  administration.  Progress  has  already  been  made  and  drafts  have  been \nprepared for a public finance management act (merging and updating the current Public Finance \nAdministration and Public Revenue acts), a new public audit act,16 and a public enterprise act. \nProcedural change is needed to ensure (i) realistic economic forecasting over at least a 3-year \nperiod; (ii) realistic assessment of all budgetary demands by government departments and PSEs; \nand (iii) systematic management of the public service, largely through a program of devolution. \nThe  Cabinet    incorporated  procedural  changes  referred  to  under  (i)  and  (ii)  in  the  budget \nguidelines for FY2003 approved on 23 January 2002. The devolution of responsibilities to heads \nof departments forms the core of  public service reform (paras. 46-50 and Appendix 5).  \n \n36.  The key to achieving sustainable fiscal balance in the short term consists of a strong \ngovernment commitment to the reform process and a \u201ctop down\u201d approach to budget making. \nThe former involves regular meetings at the Cabinet level to supervise the reform process. The \nlatter begins with developing a credible medium-term fiscal framework that is used to provide \noverall spending limits for all government-sponsored activity, including forward estimates for at \nleast three years beyond the current budget year. In the medium term, the minister of finance \nneeds the legislative authority to manage the budget execution process. Here the key feature is \ncommitment control to ensure that government spending can adapt to changing circumstances, \nand to ensure that government departments have limited ability to spend beyond agreed upon \nbudget caps.  \n \n37.  The current revenue administration is operating below desirable standards.  With limited \ncomputerization, an inadequate number of experienced staff, and lack of training, combined with \nthe  absence  of  a  comprehensive  and  appropriate  set  of  legislative  provisions  to  enforce \ncompliance, the administration is not in a position to effectively administer either the current \nlegislation  or  the  proposed  system  of  taxes.  The  Government  estimates  US$5  million  in \noutstanding taxes, and it is suggested that an effective audit program would reveal an even \nlarger amount.17 Hence, there is an urgent need for the tax administration to be strengthened in \norder both to improve revenues under the current tax regime and pave the way for tax reform. \nHowever the benefit of increased revenues from improved tax administration will only come \ntowards the end of 2003 and thereafter, when capacity for audit and compliance enforcement is \nenhanced through hiring and training of new staff and centralizing tax administration into one \nlocation.  \n \n38.  The proposed initial improvements to the tax regime include a new legislative basis for \ntax collection and training of staff, particularly in audit and compliance procedures. This system \nhas to be put in place well in advance of the proposed new tax system to allow for the \ndevelopment of the administration prior to the major challenges created by a new tax system. \nThe  legislative  changes  to  be  coupled  with  a  general  modernization  of  current  provisions \ninclude: (i) redesigning the objection/appeals process, (ii) redesigning the penalties regime, (iii) \nprovision for seizure and sale of assets to recover outstanding debts, and (iv) introduction of the \nWorld Trade Organization (WTO) valuation system.  \n \n                                                 \n16  The current Public Audit Act does not extend sufficient protection and independence to the auditor general, whom    \nCabinet may remove on the recommendation of the Prime Minister. The act sets minimal standards and does not \nrequire an analysis and performance report on the financial accounts of ministries, departments, and government \nagencies.  \n17  Estimates from the Ministry of Finance.  \n \n ", "12  \n39.  The adjustment costs of improving tax administration are estimated at US$1.5 million \nand  include  (i)  hiring  and  training  of  additional  staff,  (ii)  automation  of  tax  and  customs \nadministration,  and  (iii)  centralizing  the  location  of  the  Revenue  Department  to  enable \nautomation. The expected benefits arising from improved collection effort will be a major factor \nin ensuring that fiscal balance is sustained subsequent to FY 2005.   \n \n40.  The current tax system in Tonga relies heavily on foreign trade taxes, particularly those \non imports.18 It is affected by an extensive array of exemptions, allowances, and loopholes that \nresult in inequities and inefficiency in tax administration.19 The income tax base is narrow, and \nthe whole taxation system has become regressive. To stimulate the growth of the private sector \nand spread the tax burden across the community, it is proposed to shift the emphasis of taxes \nfrom \u201ctrade taxes\u201d (namely ports and services tax and import duties), to a limited domestic \nconsumption tax.  This tax would be collected primarily at the import stage and, with larger \nbusinesses, at the point of sale of imported or locally produced goods and services.  Coupled to \nthis would be a reworking of individual and corporate income taxes to provide a fairer system \nwith generally lower rates of tax and the abolition of the ports and services tax. PFTAC has \nassisted the Government in the preparation of this new taxation system. A cabinet paper with \nspecific recommendations on tax changes was  discussed by the Cabinet on 23 January 2002 \nand resulted in its approval to undertake wider consultations on the proposed tax reform and to \ndraft legislation. The Government is also in the process of reviewing the tariff system in the \ncontext of the planned accession to the WTO. However, the EPSRP includes improvements in \nthe current tax administration (para. 35), as they are necessary to achieve fiscal balance and \nare a precondition for the new tax regime. The introduction of the new tax regime itself is \noutside  the  scope  of  the  EPSRP.  An  outline  of  the  proposed  tax  reform  is  provided  in \nSupplementary Appendix A.  \n \n41.  Tonga has an extensive number of PSEs and trading activities owned or partly owned by \nthe Government. The number of PSEs was substantially reduced from 45 in 1997 to 32 in 2002 \n(Table 1).  \n \n42.  Many of these enterprises are performing poorly and have required additional financial \nsupport from the Government, resulting in large and unproductive investments in PSEs, which \ncontinue to drain the government budget. Little reliable information is available on employment, \nrevenue, or profitability of PSEs, and most have never paid any dividend to the Government \nwhile entertaining higher salary structures than the public service. \n \nTable 1: Number and Legal Status of Public Sector Enterprises,1997 and 2002  \nLegal Status  1997 2002\nCompanies  25 15\nFinancial Institutions  3 3\nStatutory Corporations  4 4\nBusiness Activities  13 10\n       Total   45 32\n    Source: Government Investment Unit, January 2002. \n                                                 \n18 Trade taxes account for about 13% of GDP at market prices and provide around 65% of government tax revenue. \nSales and other taxes provide about 14% of tax revenue, while direct taxes provide about 20%. \n19 Database of  PFTAC. \n \n ", "  13\n43.  There is a commitment to act on the Privy Council decision of December 1995 that MOF \nshould  submit  a  proposal  for  a  complete  review  of  all  government  investments  to  secure \ndividend payments. A Government Investment Unit (GIU)20 was established within MOF in July \n1999 to implement this review, to monitor PSE performance, and to prepare selected PSEs for \nprivatization and business activities for corporatization. A significant step forward was made in \nApril 2001 with the Privy Council\u2019s approval of Tonga's overarching investment policy. This \nframework provides a benchmark for assessing government assets and guides GIU in the \nimplementation  of  privatization  and  corporatization.  Since  1997,  the  Government  has \ncorporatized  three  business  activities  and  has  undertaken  substantial  preparatory  work  to \nproceed with the corporatization of an additional four:  the Agricultural Machinery Pool, \u2018Eua \nForestry, Post Office, and Government Printing.  \n \n44.  Reforms to be sponsored under the EPSRP build on the corporatization and privatization \npolicy framework and the public investment policy, approved by the Cabinet in March and April \n2001, respectively, as well as the Cabinet\u2019s approval (i) to draft a public enterprise act, given on \n23 January 2002; and (ii) to corporatize the Post Office, given on 30 January 2002. The EPSRP \nincludes the following sequenced reform measures: (i) enacting  the public enterprise act21 \nincluding rules and procedures regulating the relationship between PSEs and Government; and \n(ii) corporatization of at least two government business activities by the end of 2002. MFAT is \ncontinuing to provide TA in these areas, and will consider mobilizing additional specific expertise \nwhen required.  \n \n45.  The third element of fiscal reform is the privatization and corporatization of selected \ngovernment business activities. The financial adjustment costs arising from this activity are \nestimated at around US$6 million over 2002-2004. They include the writing off of accounts \nreceivable, redundancy costs, and provision of working capital less any proceeds from sale of \nassets. This amount does not include contingent liabilities, such as loans guaranteed by the \nGovernment (US$11.8 million) and loans onlent  by the Government (US$11.9 million).    \n \n    2.   Building a Performance-Based Public Service \n46.  The  need  for  public  service  reform  is  not  new.  The  Cabinet  established  three \nsubcommittees on public service reform in 2000 that reported on (i) the core functions of the \nGovernment as prescribed by existing laws and regulations, (ii) a plan for public service reform, \nand (iii) the means of implementation. In September 2001, a reform subcommittee of the Cabinet \nchaired by the deputy prime minister was established to ensure an appropriate mechanism to \ncontrol the strategic direction of the proposed reform program.  The Cabinet also approved the \nsetting up of a secretariat to manage and coordinate the EPSRP, and finalized the overall \norganizational structure, which included the appointment of a director for the secretariat, on 23 \nJanuary 2002. Public service reform measures seek to improve public service delivery to the \nprivate sector and the general public by means of (i) establishing the institutional framework for a \nperformance-oriented  public  service,  and  (ii)  promoting  efficient  and  effective  performance \nmanagement. \n \n47.  The public service establishment in FY2001 totaled 5,443 positions, with 562 vacancies \nand 461 employees eligible for retirement. In addition, there were approximately 700 casual \nworkers paid on a daily basis, although some had been casual for a considerable period of time. \n                                                 \n20 Since November 1999, GIU has received TA from MFAT.   \n21 A draft public enterprise act has been prepared and will be introduced into the Legislative Assembly before \nDecember 2002.  \n \n ", "14  \nThe wage and salary bill constituted 57% of the Government\u2019s current expenditure in FY2001 \nand  crowded  out  essential  expenditures  on  operation  and  maintenance.  The  Government \naccepts that the size of the public service is unnecessarily large and is committed to rightsizing \nin a manner that does not compromise the quality of service delivery. The overall target for \nrationalization of the public service is expressed in a reduction of wages and salaries from 57% \nto 50% of current expenditure over a 3-year period. In conjunction with the budget guidelines for \nFY2003,  the  Cabinet  instructed  heads  of  departments  to  base  their  departmental  budget \nsubmission on this target. This will be achieved through a combination of (i) natural attrition, (ii) \nenforcement of the retirement age of 60,22 (iii) voluntary early retirement over the age of 50 with \ncompensation payment,23 (iv) voluntary reduction of working hours, (v) part-time employment, \n(vi) reduced entitlement for approved study leave to half-pay for the first year only, (vii) reduction \nof the sick leave entitlement, (viii) reduced annual leave, (ix) freeze of annual salary increments \nfor 2 years, (x) introduction of merit-based salary policy, and (xi) targeted downsizing. The \nEPSRP combines rightsizing with general organizational changes of the public service, which \ninclude the establishment of a public service commission to strengthen policy support to the \nCabinet  and  to  improve  performance  management.  The  current  public  service  regulations \n(Estacode) and the Government Act are inconsistent with the principles of good governance. \nThis will be rectified through  a new public service act with revised regulations.  \n \n48.  The  third  cabinet  subcommittee  recommended  that  the  planning,  monitoring,  and \nreporting functions of departments be strengthened. The Cabinet noted the need to devolve \nselected responsibilities to line ministries and to have heads of department made accountable \nfor the performance of their departments. The EPSRP includes strengthening of performance \nmanagement functions with model plans and reporting formats. Accountability will be enhanced \nwith the introduction of performance agreements for heads of departments and holders of key  \npositions. \n \n49.  An analysis of a baseline survey to establish a profile for the Tongan public service \nidentified the need for a performance-based remuneration policy.  The job grades, occupational \nclassifications, and payscales of the public service are inconsistent with the need to reward \nmerit performance and attract and retain competent staff.  A job evaluation exercise integrated \nwith a revision of the current remuneration policy is planned to address this situation. \n \n50.  The estimated financial adjustment costs relating to public service reform over the 3-year \nperiod 2002-2004 comprise (i) pension payments of US$4 million, (ii) compensation payments \nof  US$2  million  for  voluntary  early  retirement  and  retrenched  public  servants,  (iii) \nimplementation costs of US$0.2 million for human resources management information system \n(HRMIS),  (iv)  establishment  costs  of  US$0.5  million  for  the  reform  secretariat  and  social \nmonitoring unit, and (v) additional mitigation measures of US$1 million. Savings of around \nUS$2.6 million are expected from changes in the size and composition of the public service. \nHowever,  these  benefits  will  most  likely  accrue  towards  the  end  of  the  loan  period  and \nthereafter, due to the varied nature of the proposed rightsizing measures.  \n \n                                                 \n22 With the enforcement of the current retirement age of 60, 461 public servant positions (or 9% of the 4,881 filled and \nestablished positions) will be vacated. \n23The compensation to be awarded to early retirees will be 5% of respective current salary multiplied by the difference \nin years between the retiree\u2019s current age and the official retirement age of 60. This compensation is midrange \nwhen compared with compensation offered by other PDMCs, and is seen by the Establishment Office to be \nsufficient to attract an adequate number of volunteer early retirees.  \n \n ", "  15\nD.  Social and Environmental Issues \n \n1.  Social  and Poverty Impact \n \n51.  Tonga  has  achieved  relatively  high  social  indicators  as  a  result  of  government \ninvestments in social sectors and service provision over the past 30 years. The constrained \nfiscal situation will have short and medium-term implications for the provision of all government \nservices if reform measures designed to regain fiscal balance are not introduced within the near \nfuture. With the implementation of the public service reform, aimed at increasing the efficiency \nand effectiveness of the public service, it is anticipated that service delivery to the general public \nwill improve in the medium term.  \n \n52.  The major socioeconomic impacts over the next 2-3 years are likely be a reduction in \nincome of approximately 500 or more households, mainly in the capital, Nuku\u2019alofa, due to the \nenforcement  of  the  retirement  age,  early  voluntary  retirement,  or  retrenchment  with \ncompensation. Lump sum payments are unlikely to provide long-term social security for retirees. \nHouseholds depending on a single income from a public sector employee who retires or is \nretrenched will be the most vulnerable, especially those on a low salary scale and/or where the \nhousehold has limited access to land. Amendments of the current tax and customs legislation \nwill enable the Government to collect unpaid taxes and duties. It is safe to assume that the \nmajority of the outstanding taxes are owed by private enterprises and  high-income earners.  \n \n53.  Assuming that Tonga\u2019s strong customs of family assistance will cushion the impact of \nreduced public sector expenditure and provide traditional social safety net functions, the high \ndependency ratio will continue to rise. Currently about 20% of the population provide for the \nother 80%. Those in employment in Tonga will have increased financial obligations, and the \ndemand on relatives working overseas will increase.  \n \n54.  To mitigate the negative impact of rightsizing, the EPSRP includes social safety net \narrangements. Efforts will be made to ensure that the population of the outer islands will not be \naffected disproportionately. Affected staff (voluntary early retirees and involuntary redundancies) \nwill receive separation payments and will have access to counseling and training to be arranged \nby the economic and social impact monitoring unit under the Prime Minister\u2019s Office (PMO). \nThis includes community-based financial management training, and technical and business \ntraining  to  mitigate  the  overall  social  and  gender  impacts  of  affected  staff  (paras.  55-57). \nDetailed retrenchment plans will be prepared by departments. The plans will be reviewed by the \neconomic  and  social  impact  monitoring  unit  for  consistency  with  the  principles  of  equity \nconsiderations and protection of the vulnerable as expressed in the ADB Social Protection \nStrategy.24 Mitigation measures will include provisions to ensure that women, public servants in \nthe outer islands, and other affected workers vulnerable to poverty (i) will have equal opportunity \nto participate in the training programs and avail of small business opportunities, and (ii) will not \nbe impoverished by the retrenchment.  \n \n55.  The proportion of women in public sector employment may decline, and low-paid female \nclerical workers are likely to be the most vulnerable to retrenchment. Reduction in public sector \nemployment opportunities and possible cuts to expenditure on secondary education are likely to \nincrease  the  number  of  unemployed  young  people.  Self-employment  will  be  an  option  for \nwomen  and  unemployed  youth,  which  will  be  facilitated  through  short-term  business  and \ntechnical skills training. \n                                                 \n24 ADB. 2001. Social Protection Strategy. Manila \n \n ", "16  \n \n56.  An efficient and performance-oriented public service will have positive social impacts by \nimproving the quality of government services to the public. However, Tonga already has a deficit \nof skilled and professional people in the health and postsecondary technical training sectors. It \nis very likely that these skilled public servants will opt for early retirement, seek opportunities \nabroad, and join the ranks of Tongan migrants. It is therefore essential that reform measures \ninclude incentives to retain government employees with essential skills. These comprise (i) \nintroduction  of  performance-based  contracts  for  heads  of  departments  and  senior  public \nservants, (ii) revision of the current remuneration policy, and (iii) introduction of a merit-based \npay policy.   \n \n57.  Anticipated  private  sector  growth  will  increase  jobs  and  opportunities  for  self-\nemployment and will in turn reduce youth unemployment.  However this requires that post-\nsecondary training be more closely matched to labor market demands in Tonga than is currently \nthe case.  \n \n58.  Social monitoring and public consultation constitute a key element in the reform process. \nA Tongan participatory/public relations specialist25 is assisting the Government in a broad-based \nconsultative process that engages members of the public sector, the private sector, and civil \nsociety through workshops and seminars targeting specific groups (politicians, public sector \nofficials, chamber of commerce, churches, nongovernment organizations [NGOs]) and hearings \nthat bring together representatives of the Government, the business community, NGOs, and the \ngeneral public. Further details on the social and poverty impact are in Appendix 4.  \n \n2.  Mitigation Measures  \n \n59.  In  addition  to  financial  compensation  packages  for  voluntary  early  retirees  and \nredundancies,  a  range  of  nonfinancial  mitigation  measures  will  be  available.  Many  public \nservants taking early retirement will still be potentially economically active, and some will have \nskills and experience that will make them attractive to private sector employers.  However, a \nlarge number of civil servants who retire or are retrenched will be in the low-pay, low-skill \ncategory. The Government is concerned about the future of people in this group.  A number of \nretraining options will be available. Training needs assessments will be carried out by the \neconomic and social impact monitoring unit after the staffing plans have been prepared by each \ndepartment.  Funds  have  been  earmarked  from  the  proceeds  of  the  loan  to  ensure  that \ncounterpart funds are available for these mitigation measures.  \n \n60.  There is broad agreement from the private sector that two types of skills are in demand: \n(i) bookkeeping/basic accounting and the use of simple accounting software packages; and (ii) \nword processing and spreadsheet computer applications, and office automation. These possible \njob opportunities are of particular interest  mainly to clerical staff, who will be encouraged to \nparticipate  in  training  offering  these  skills.  Other  training  options  include  small  business \nmanagement, technical skills and horticulture. A number of NGOs and government training \ninstitutions  are  offering  short-term  vocational  training  courses.  These  institutions  will  be \nengaged by the  economic and social impact monitoring unit to carry out tailor-made programs \n(see Appendix 4). \n \n                                                 \n25 ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to Tonga for Economic and Public Sector Reform Program. Manila. \n \n \n ", "  17\n61.  Pension payouts and compensation packages are paid in lump sums. Prudent financial \nmanagement practices will be needed to make these funds last.  Because of cultural factors and \ncustomary communal obligations and pressures, training programs targeting only those who will \nbe  leaving  public  service  will  not  be  sufficient.  It  will  be  necessary  to  gain  broad-based \nunderstanding\u2014among  the  families  of  people  leaving  government  employment\u2014of  the \nimportance of financial management at the household level to avoid poverty and increase social \nsecurity. This will be achieved through training and awareness programs that will involve both \nrural and urban families throughout the country and will be implemented by selected civil society \norganizations. \n \n3.  Environmental Issues \n \n62.  The EPSRP is classified as Category C in ADB\u2019s environmental classification system. Its \nenvironmental impact is expected to be minimal. The Program does not deal directly with \nenvironmental concerns.  \n \nV.  THE PROPOSED LOAN \nA.  Amount of Loan and Source of Funds \n \n63.  The Government has asked ADB to provide a loan of US$10 million equivalent from its \nSpecial Funds resources to support economic and public sector reforms. The size of the loan is \nbased on the scope and costs of (i) fiscal reforms, and (ii) public service reforms. It takes into \naccount the importance and urgency of these reforms, and the availability of funding for the \nGovernment\u2019s overall reform program. The total funds required for the reform measures amount to \nUS$15.2 million over the period 2002-2004. The proceeds from the program loan cover about \n66% of these financial adjustment costs.  \n \nB.  Interest, Maturity, and Utilization Period \n \n64.  The loan will bear a 24-year maturity, including a grace period of 8 years, and 1% interest \ncharge during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter. The loan is expected to be utilized over a 20-\nmonth period.  \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n65.  MOF will be the Executing Agency for the EPSRP and will be responsible for its overall \nimplementation. A fiscal reform team with five senior government officials will be established by \nMOF. The other key agency involved in the implementation of the Program is the PMO. A public \nsector reform team, led by the establishment office in the PMO, will be responsible for the \ncoordination  and  implementation  of  these  reform  activities.  The  Government  established  a \ncabinet committee for reform in 2000, and the Cabinet approved the overall organizational \nstructure  of  the  reform  program  and  the  EPSRP  on  23  January  2002.  This  includes  the \nestablishment of a reform secretariat and the appointment of a senior public servant to head it. It \nwill  also  have  additional  staff  and  necessary  resources,  acceptable  to  ADB.  Program \nimplementation  will  be  coordinated  on  a  day-to-day  basis  by  the  secretariat  and  will  be \nundertaken by the two reform teams, which will report monthly to the Cabinet through the reform \nsecretariat and the cabinet committee for reform. TA for implementation of the public service \nreform will be provided under the EPSRP  (see Appendix 5).  \n \n ", "18  \n \nD.  Procurement \n \n66.  In accordance with simplified disbursement procedures and related requirements for \nprogram loans,26 goods and services produced and originating in ADB member countries, other \nthan those items specified on a negative list (Appendix 6) and imports financed by other bilateral \nand multilateral sources, will be procured in accordance with standard public sector procedures \nin the Kingdom of Tonga and normal commercial practices for procurement by the private \nsector,  acceptable  to  ADB.  ADB  has  ensured  that  standard  public  and  private  sector \nprocurement  procedures  used  in  the  country  are  adequate  in  terms  of  competition  and \nefficiency. In the case of goods commonly traded on the international commodity markets, they \nwill be procured in accordance with procedures appropriate to the trade and acceptable to ADB.  \n \nE.  Disbursement \n \n67.  The proceeds of the loan will be disbursed only to finance the foreign exchange costs of \na broad range of imports, subject to the negative list of ineligible items (Appendix 6). The loan \nwill be disbursed on the basis of a certification provided by the Borrower confirming that, in each \nyear in which EPSRP proceeds are expected to be disbursed, the value of total imports minus \n(i) imports from nonmember countries, (ii) ineligible imports, and (iii) imports financed under \nother official development assistance, will be equivalent to or greater than the amount expected \nto be disbursed during the year. ADB will have the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds \nand to verify the accuracy of the Borrower\u2019s certification. \n \nF.  Counterpart Funds \n \n68.  Counterpart funds to be generated from the proceeds of the program loan will be used to \nfinance part of the local currency costs relating to the implementation of the fiscal and public \nservice reforms. The total financial adjustment costs include (i) US$1.5 million for improved tax \nadministration, (ii) US$6.0 million for corporatization and privatization of selected government \nbusiness activities, and (iii) US$7.7 million for public service reform. The loan proceeds of US$10 \nmillion  equivalent  represent  about    66%  of  the  estimated  total  adjustment  costs  of  around \nUS$15.2 million. To mitigate the anticipated impacts of public service reform, at least 20% of the \ncounterpart funds have been earmarked to assist those affected. Although savings of around \nUS$7 million are expected to result from reform activities supported by the proposed program \nloan, these benefits are anticipated to  materialize only towards the end of the loan period and \nthereafter; thus, they will help to enhance the sustainability of postreform fiscal balances. \n \nG.  Monitoring and Tranching \n \n69.  ADB will carry out periodic reviews of the progress of implementing the EPSRP, and will \nassess the impact of the Program on vulnerable groups and other sectors of the economy. \nFormal reviews will be undertaken jointly by the reform secretariat and ADB every 6 months. \nThe Government will keep ADB informed of the outcome of the policy discussions with other \nmultilateral and bilateral aid agencies that have implications for the implementation of the \nProgram, and will provide ADB with the opportunity to comment on policy proposals by other \nmajor funding agencies.  The representatives of the Government, ADB, and other major funding \nagencies  for  the  EPSRP  will  meet  at  least  once  every  6  months  to  review  program \nimplementation. The meetings will continue after the closing of the loan and will form part of the \n                                                 \n26 ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila.  \n \n ", "  19\ncountry strategy and program (CSP). A key focus of monitoring will be performance on the \nbroad policy reforms, the results of which will be included in the CSP updates.  \n \n70.  In addition to quarterly progress reports on EPSRP performance (to be prepared by the \nreform secretariat), the Government will submit a program completion report to ADB within 3 \nmonths of the loan closing date. This report will evaluate the implementation of the policy reform \nmeasures under the EPSRP, their impact on the economy, lessons learned during the EPSRP \nperiod, and any further reforms and assistance required in the medium term.  \n \n71.  The program loan covers the period from April 2002 to December 2003. The loan funds \nwill be released in two tranches of equal size. The time-bound policies and actions to be carried \nout under the EPSRP are described in the DPL (Appendix 3) and are contained in the policy \nmatrix (Appendix 2). The first tranche of US$5 million equivalent will be made available upon loan \neffectiveness. The second tranche will be made available when all conditions of the second \ntranche have been fulfilled, as specified in the policy matrix. This is targeted for March 2003; \nhowever, should the conditions be satisfied earlier, the second tranche may be released earlier.  \n \n72.  In addition to preparatory steps taken prior to June 2001, the Government has also \nproceeded with the following first tranche conditions to ensure that  fiscal balance can be \nachieved and the public sector reform can be implemented in a timely and efficient manner.  At \nthe end of January 2002, the situation was as follows: \n \n(i)  introduction of a temporary hiring freeze on 1 July 2001, which was converted to \na permanent hiring freeze on 23 January 2002;  \n(ii)  cabinet approval (as part of the budget guidelines adopted on 23 January 2002) \nof (a) budget preparation to include an estimate of government revenues from all \nsources,  including  anticipated  revenues  from  the  Tonga  Trust  Fund,  tax \nrevenues,  and  departmental  cost  recovery  through  fees  and  charges;  (b) \nestablishing an overall expenditure ceiling which, on the basis of the forecast, \nwould reestablish fiscal balance between recurrent expenditures and government \nrevenues no later than FY2005; (c) expenditure ceiling to be set to cover all \ngovernment spending on departmental budgets and public enterprises that can \nreasonably  be  foreseen;  (d)  individual  expenditure  allocations  to  ministries, \nalthough subject to negotiation during budget finalization,  to be set so as not \ncollectively  to  exceed  the  aggregate  ceiling  (net  of  nondepartmental \nexpenditure); \n(iii)  cabinet  instructions  to  all  heads  of  department,  as  per  budget  guidelines \napproved on 23 January 2002, to prepare their annual budget estimates with a \nview to reducing the wage and salary share of the Government\u2019s cash spending \nnet of debt services from 57% budgeted in FY2002 to 50% in FY2005;  \n(iv)  cabinet notification to all departments and government agencies on 23 January \n2002 that no further extension of credit will be allowed without prior approval by \nthe minister of finance, in accordance with existing legislation, and that monthly \nreports show no new arrears starting March 2002;  \n(v)  cabinet approval of the organizational structure of the reform program, including \nthe establishment of a reform secretariat and appointment of a director for the \nsecretariat; \n(vi)  cabinet approval on 23 January 2003 to update the public finance administration, \npublic revenue, and public audit acts, and to proceed with the drafting of a public \nenterprises act ;   \n \n ", "20  \n(vii)  drafts of the public finance management act and the public enterprise acts to be \navailable and commencement of the legislative process on 8 March 2002;  \n(viii)  cabinet  discussion  on  23  January  2002  of  the  proposed  tax  reform  and \ninstructions to the minister of finance to proceed with wider public consultations \nand to prepare required legislation; and \n(ix)  cabinet approval on 30 January 2002 of the corporatization of the Post Office.  \n \n73.  The second tranche release conditions are as follows:  \n \n(i)  An economic and social impact monitoring unit will be established within the \nPMO/Central Planning Department.   \n(ii)  A new public finance management act will be enacted to strengthen the ability of \nMOF to maintain the integrity of the fiscal framework.   \n(iii)  Amendments to the current tax and customs legislation will be enacted with a \nview to strengthening tax administration and enforcing compliance with customs, \nsales, and income taxes.  \n(iv)  A public enterprises act will be enacted to regulate the relationship between \npublic enterprises and the Government.   \n(v)  A public service act will be enacted to regulate the operations of the public \nservice. \n(vi)  An HRMIS will have been developed and become fully operational within the \nPMO.  \n \nVI.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n74.   In addition to the loan, it is proposed that ADB provide TA of US$700,000 to support the \nreform secretariat and the establishment office in the PMO with the implementation of the EPSRP \npublic service reforms in building a performance-oriented public service. The TA will (i) facilitate \ngood governance practices and strengthen the planning, monitoring, and reporting capabilities of \nthe ministries; (ii) establish the central HRMIS to provide users with timely, accurate and relevant \nestablishment information; (iii) introduce performance accountability for heads of departments; (iv) \nsupport  the  introduction  of  performance-oriented  and  merit-based  remuneration  policies  and \nprocedures; and (v) assist in the preparation of regulations and implementation guidelines  for \nnew legislation under the EPSRP. MOF will be the Executing Agency for the TA.  The EPSRP \nreform  subcommittee  of  the  Cabinet  will  provide  overall  guidance  on  implementation.  The \nGovernment will establish a public service reform secretariat under the PMO and will provide (i) \ntwo full-time counterparts, supported by part-time subproject teams; (ii) office accommodation; (iii) \nlocal transportation; and (iv) secretarial support services. The TA will finance 28 person-months of \ninternational consulting services, HRMIS software and license fees, job evaluation methodology, \nworkshops  and  surveys.  ADB  will  select  and  engage  the  team  of  individual  consultants  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The TA will be financed by ADB on \na grant basis from the ADB-funded TA program.  Additional information is provided in Appendix 5.  \n \nVII.  PROGRAM BENEFITS AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits \n \n75.  The economic and public sector reforms supported by the Program will restore fiscal \nstability, increasing the efficiency of the public sector and creating a conducive environment for \nprivate  sector  growth.  Amendments  to  the  current  tax  and  customs  legislation  and  their \nenforcement by a strengthened tax administration will not only ensure that outstanding taxes, \n \n ", "  21\nestimated at US$5 million, will be collected, but will also help in achieving fiscal balance and \nimproved service delivery. They will also ensure transparent and predictable taxation, reduce \ncorrupt  practices,  and  subsequently  improve  the  investment  climate  in  Tonga.  The \ncorporatization  of  government  business  activities  will  fully  expose  these  entities  to  market \nforces, ensuring efficient and cost-effective service delivery to their customers and creating \nequal conditions with private service providers. The EPSRP will help to achieve rightsizing of \nthe public service, while improving its effectiveness and efficiency by means of performance \norientation  and  accountability  mechanisms.  A  key  element  to  achieve  this  is  by  devolving \nfinancial and human resource responsibilities to heads of departments. It will enable a demand- \ndriven and flexible service delivery to the general public and to the private sector in particular. In \nturn, this will improve public sentiments regarding the Government and its employees. Enforcing \nthe established retirement age of 60 and offering voluntary retirement from age 50 will open up \ncareer prospects to younger public servants who otherwise would opt to migrate. These benefits \nwill  offset  short-term  negative  social  impacts.    The  reforms  will  also  increase  economic \nresilience by reducing vulnerability to external circumstances created by the currently excessive \ndependence on overseas remittances and taxes on imported goods. \n \nB.  Risks \n \n76.  Political authority is highly centralized  in the King and the Cabinet, and the Government \nexerts a high degree of control over the economy.  The successful implementation of reform will \nrequire  considerable  and  sustained  political  will  to  (i)  delegate  an  increased  share  of \nmanagement responsibilities to government departments within the reform framework; and (ii)  \ncreate a transparent, consistent, and responsive policy environment. To date, such risks have \nbeen mitigated by the strong commitment of most senior government officials to push through \nthe key policy reforms.  The Government\u2019s establishment of a public-private sector consultative \ncommittee in 1998 was an acknowledgement of the importance of increased public participation \nin the decision-making process. Reform measures have been in preparation for some time, but \nuntil recently have not been acted upon by the Cabinet. Hence, they have not been placed \nbefore the Privy Council and the Parliament. The reform program is strongly supported by the \nPrivy  Council.  The  Prime  Minister  and  the  minister  of  finance,  both  appointed  with  the \nendorsement of the Privy Council, were selected because of their recognized commitment to \nreform.  Over the past 2 years, the Privy Council has also approved several policy measures to \nimprove the governance of PSEs and to lay the groundwork for corporatization and privatization.  \nThese  developments  indicate  that  the  proposed  reforms  are  supported  by  the  highest \nauthorities in the country. \n \n77.  For the first time, Tonga is confronted with a situation that leaves the Government no \noption but to reform. The fast-deteriorating fiscal situation, the disappointing economic growth\u2014\nafter the devastation caused by tropical cyclone Waka, GDP growth is now estimated to be \nbelow 1.5%\u2014and, most critical, the disappearance of the safety net, the eroded Tonga Trust \nFund,  have  together    shaped  the  necessary  specific  \u201cmacroeconomic  moment\u201d  where \nmacroeconomic  vulnerability  has  generated  broad-based  commitment  to  reform.    The \nParliament  is  fully  aware  of  this  situation  and  is  expected  to  fully  support  the  proposed \nlegislative reforms.  \n \n78.  A major risk is that the Government may lack the capacity and management resources \nto implement some of the important reform measures, despite strong political will. The TA for \nbuilding  a  performance-based  public  service  will  support  the  implementation  of  the  public \nservice reform, and activities associated with the rightsizing of the public service. Assistance \nprovided  by  AusAID  on  public  financial  management,  training  of  staff  in  the  Revenue \n \n ", "22  \nDepartment, and the provision of two long-term advisors for tax and customs administration; \nPFTAC\u2019s continuing support for  tax legislation and the tax reform;  and MFAT\u2019s support to the \nGIU on commercialization and privatization of PSEs will all facilitate the timely implementation of \nthe reform agenda.  \n \nVIII.  ASSURANCES \n79.  In  addition  to  the  conditions  for  tranche  release  and  the  standard  assurances,  the \nGovernment has assured ADB that \n \n(i)  the policies adopted and actions taken prior to the date of the Loan Agreement, \nas described in the Government\u2019s DPL, will continue in effect for the duration of \nthe program period; \n \n(ii)  it will promptly adopt the other policies and take the other actions included in the \nEPSRP, as described in the policy matrix, and ensure that these policies and \nactions continue in effect for the duration of the EPSRP; \n \n(iii)  it will ensure adequate representation of women on committees, task forces, and \nother  public  bodies  dealing  with  the  building  of  a  performance-based  public \nservice; and \n \n(iv)  it will ensure that the private sector and civil society groups are adequately \ninvolved in implementing the reforms through membership in task forces and \ncommittees dealing with reform issues.  \n \nIX.

Introduction \n \n1.  The social assessment is linked to the two major areas of the economic and public \nsector reform (EPSRP): (i) achievement of sustainable fiscal balance, and (ii) improvement of \npublic service delivery to the private sector and the general public. A specialist1 in social impact \nassessments has evaluated the effects of policy changes under the EPSRP on the stakeholders \nand vulnerable groups, examined the current social security system, and assessed the social \nimplications and poverty impact of the conditionalities under the EPSRP. The methods used for \nthe social impact assessment included individual interviews and focus group discussions with a \nwide range of senior government officials and civil servants, private sector representatives, and \ncivil society groups. Social monitoring and public consultation are a key element of the reform \nprocess. In addition, a Tongan participatory/public relations specialist (footnote 1) is assisting \nthe  Government  in  a  broad-based  consultative  process  through  workshops  and  seminars, \ntargeting specific groups (politicians, public sector officials, chamber of commerce, churches, \nand civil society groups) and hearings that bring together representatives of the Government, \nthe business community, civil society groups, and the general public.  \n \nB.  Socioeconomic Context \n2.  Population. The 1996 census recorded a population of 97,784. The total fertility rate \nwas calculated at 4.2%, which, although high, has been offset by high emigration rates since the \n1970s; thus the average annual population growth rate since 1986 is low at 0.3% per annum. \nThe number of Tongans living overseas was estimated to be between 35,000-45,000 in 1993 \nand may now be considerably higher.2  \n \n3.  Urbanization. There has been a massive shift from an agricultural subsistence-based \neconomy to  substantial dependence on emigration, remittances, and public sector employment \ncombined with increased urbanization. Sixty-eight percent of the population of Tongatapu, the \nmost populous island in the group, live in the urban area of Nuku\u2019alofa, and villages on the \nisland are developing increasingly suburban characteristics.  The Government has recognized \nurban growth as an issue of concern since 1966, putting pressure on national resources for \nincreased expenditure on physical infrastructure. Efforts continue to distribute services equitably \nbetween the rural and urban population. The provision of high schools in the outer islands  \n(Ha\u2019api group, Vava\u2019u, Niuataputopu, and Niuafo\u2019ou) aims to discourage rural-urban migration.  \n \n4.  Despite extensive socioeconomic changes over the past 30 years, Tongan customs and \ntraditions, the monarchy, the churches, and the extended family continue to be respected and \nemphasized and are all interconnected.  \n   \n5.  Human Development. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) human \ndevelopment index ranks Tonga sixth out of 14 Pacific Island states.3 On a global scale Tonga \nis  ranked  107.  Tonga\u2019s  relatively  high  ranking  arises  from  its  social  achievements  in  the \nprovision of universal primary education, public health services, water, and sanitation, which \nhave produced an almost universally literate population with average life expectancy of 67 years \nbased on calculations in 1996. Although Tonga is encountering some social problems, and \n                                                 \n1 A social sector/social impact assessment expert and a participatory/public relations specialist have been engaged. \nADB. 2001.

", "  Appendix 4  43 \nalthough it lacks some modern democratic institutions, it is peaceful, orderly, and generally \nequitable in comparison with some Pacific developing member countries (PDMCs) and many \ncountries in the Asia and Pacific region.  \n \n6.  Gender. The gender equity and the status of women is higher in Tonga than in many \nother PDMCs in terms of women\u2019s health status, participation rates in secondary education, and \nshare of senior and middle management jobs. However, women have a smaller overall share of \nemployment in the paid labor force.  There is gender disparity in tertiary qualifications. Although \nmore  girls  than  boys  complete  secondary  education,  many  more  men  than  women  have \ntechnical and higher education qualifications. \n \n7.  There is significant legal discrimination against women with regard to property rights. \nVery few women have direct rights to own land, due to a patrilineal system of land allocation \nand inheritance adopted in the 19th century. Further, women are not permitted to legally register \nland in their own names.4 This affects women\u2019s access to credit, as significant assets tend to be \nregistered in the names of men.5 Indicative recent surveys6 suggest that more men than women \nin economically active age groups migrate. Accordingly women-headed households (19%  of all \nhouseholds in 1996) constitute a vulnerable group. There is concern that if the law gave every \nwoman equal rights of inheritance with her brothers, control of portions of land might pass from \nthe control of her own family and come under the control of her husband\u2019s family. Although \nkainga (extended families) count both males and females as members by birth, and accord \nspecial respect to sisters and members of the female descent line, the control of family property \nis patrilineal. This fact has some influence on family decisions about educational investment in \nfavor of males, although it is offset by the fact that families tend to invest in children who \nachieve well, irrespective of their gender.  \n \n8.  Poverty. Among ADB\u2019s 12 PDMCs, Tonga ranks first in the human poverty index. There \nare no recent household income and expenditure data on which firm conclusions about poverty \ncan be based.7 In line with ADB\u2019s new policy on poverty reduction, a preliminary poverty \nassessment was carried out under a regional technical assistance.8 The initial findings were \ncompiled and circulated to the Government for comments. Additional data will be gathered for \nfurther assessment of the poverty situation in Tonga through a small-scale TA,9 which was \napproved in 2000, to assist the Government in conducting a household income and expenditure \nsurvey. The poor, in terms of national relativity, are those who suffer \u201cpoverty of opportunity\u201d in \nrelation to employment and other chances to improve their standards of living, particularly the \nyouthful  majority.  Many  Tongans  live  in  overcrowded,  poor-quality  houses,  in  conditions \nconducive to social stress.     \n \n                                                 \n4  According to the Women in Law Association (WILA) , women want changes in the law allowing all people the right \nto register land. WILA has undertaken a United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization-funded \nsurvey of women\u2019s knowledge and attitudes about their legal status in rural areas and the outer islands. The results \nare currently being analyzed. \n5  Most lending agencies including the Tonga Development Bank (TDB) require loans to be secured against saleable \n(or leaseable) assets. TDB has a US$2 million revolving loan fund that makes small loans to persons qualifying as \npoor or disadvantaged. Some borrowers from this fund are women and women\u2019s groups using both group \nguarantees and their husband\u2019s co-signature to secure credit. \n6   Government of Tonga. 1999.

Informal settlements exist in outer Nuku\u2019alofa and on Pangai in the Ha\u2019apai group. The \nlatter is said to be more of a temporary camp for outer island parents, mainly mothers, caring for \nchildren attending school. The settlement at Patangata in a swampy area beside a rubbish \ndump outside Nuku\u2019alofa is more permanent, and most residents have moved there from the \nouter islands both to find work in the town and to educate their children. The standard of \nhousing and general living conditions in this settlement have improved dramatically in recent \nyears. The main disadvantage faced by residents is periodic flooding and associated health \nrisks.  \n \n10.  A high proportion of commoners have no formal rights to land because the numbers \neligible10 to receive allotments of land exceed the provisions for land distribution under the \nConstitution of 1875, and land availability. However most people have access of one kind or \nanother to land if they need it for housing, to grow food, or to make a simple living. People of \nhigh traditional status have many privileges, not the least of which is access to land that returns \nrents of various kinds, but although Tonga is highly socially stratified, the gap between rich and \npoor is not as great as in many developing countries. \n \n11.  Social problems are considered to have increased along with the growth in the urban \npopulation. Physical assault and theft, including breaking and entering, are among the leading \ntypes of crime. Youth crime is not significant in Tonga, although there are growing concerns \nabout delinquency in the urban area; most criminal acts are committed by persons aged 30-\n35.11 Few data exist on domestic violence, which is included in police statistics with all types of \nassault,  but  it  is  a  recognized  social  problem.  A  recent  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund \n(UNICEF) study showed that 57.4% of all secondary school students interviewed reported \nhaving sustained one or more deliberate physical injuries in the previous 12 months, and about \none third reported the injuries inflicted by one or both parents.12 The Catholic Women\u2019s League \nhas recently established a center for women and children to counter problems of domestic \nviolence. \n \n12.  Social Safety Nets. There is no formal social security system for all citizens, although \ngovernment  employees  in  established  positions  and  some  private  sector  employees  are \ncovered by various retirement benefit arrangements. The Government has also agreed to the \ncreation of a national retirement fund to provide for employees not covered by the government \nscheme.13 This will not provide a social safety net for its members until the fund grows over \ntime. \n \n13.  The  Government  provides  for  general  public  welfare  by  allowing  extended  school \nattendance, low government school fees, and free government health services. Children are \nconsidered to have an obligation to support their parents in old age, and various kinds of mutual \nassistance mechanisms exist within families, although these are often severely strained by lack \nof financial resources.  \n \n14.  Tonga has a high dependency ratio. About 20% of the population support the other \n80%.14 Demographic trends indicate that the majority of migrants are able-bodied adults. The \n                                                 \n10 Firstborn sons inherit land allotments, and all adult males are entitled to receive allotments of land. \n11 Annual Report 2000, Ministry of Police.

", "  Appendix 4  45 \nproportion of elderly people in the population is projected to increase from 1 person aged 60 or \nmore in every 13 people, to one person in 8 in 2026. A recent survey of 150 rural and peri-urban \nhouseholds  with  elderly  members  showed  that,  of  these  households,  one  third  had  total \ncombined annual incomes of under TS$6,000, one third under TS$12,000, and one third above \nTS$12,000 per annum. Of 208 elderly people surveyed, 15 considered themselves \u201cvery poor, \nlife is a struggle,\u201d 106 said that they were \u201cpoor, but managing,\u201d 83 that they were \u201caverage, \nnormal,\u201d and 1 who was \u201cquite prosperous.\u201d 15 \n \n15.   The survey showed that household expenditure tended to exceed income in most cases, \nparticularly in urban Nuku\u2019alofa. This indicates income from remittances, but also borrowing. \nAside from the commercial banks, informal moneylending is easily accessible at very high rates \nof interest, and borrowing tends to be recurrent, to bridge cashflow problems. Most wage and \nsalary earners have debts, and many middle or higher income earners have mortgages. Most \nwage and salary earners have financial obligations to their immediate and extended families, \nand to their churches. \n \n16.  Remittances. Migrant relatives assist many households, but the relationship between \nisland-based and overseas Tongans tends to be reciprocal. Children usually support or assist \ntheir parents or other relatives who raised them, whether they emigrate or remain in Tonga. \nMany working emigrant couples send children home, or leave them behind when they emigrate, \nto be taken care of by relatives. Taro and yam\u2014these root crops are a stable diet for Tongans\u2014\nand traditional cultural goods such as bark cloth, mats, and other items are in demand in \noverseas communities, and are exchanged for consumer goods or money between island \nresidents and Tongans overseas, through various mechanisms.  \n \n17.  Money  is  often  sent  to  relatives  in  Tonga  by  emigrants,  not  to  support  everyday \nconsumption, but as contributions to the ceremonial obligations or special needs of relatives. \nAnother \u201cremittance\u201d mechanism is short-term emigration, when people go overseas to work in \norder to earn a target sum to bring home for purposes such as building a house, or when groups \ngo overseas to raise funds for special projects from emigrant communities. \n \n18.  The remittance-based economy depends on a continued flow of emigrants, as once \nmigrants become established overseas, they usually buy or lease homes, raise families, and \ncannot afford to send much money home. Overseas-born Tongans are much less likely than \nfirst generation migrants to feel an obligation to send money to relatives in their ancestral land. \nThe major source of remittances is from the United States. \n \n19.  Youth. Over half the population is under 19 years old. Youth are kept at school as long \nas  possible  due  to  employment  aspirations  and  lack  of  employment  opportunities.  The \nsecondary school dropout rate is low but increases to around 22% in forms 5 and 6. The \nemployment service unit in the Ministry of Labor, Commerce and Industries registered 254 job \nseekers in 2000. Some young people registered but refused offers of employment for positions \nsuch as shop assistant because they aspired to clerical positions, preferably in the public \nservice. \n \n20.  Education. Tonga has a high level of educational achievement, with near 100% literacy. \nThere is universal primary education, and  retention of almost all students to the mid-secondary \nschool level. The Government provides a primary school for every inhabited island with a \nprimary school-age population. Most are operated by the Government, some by churches or \n                                                 \n15 Central Planning Department. 2000. National Retirement Benefits Project to Tonga. Nuku\u2019alofa. \n ", "46  Appendix 4 \nother  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs).  All  teachers  in  government  schools  and \napproximately twothirds in nongovernment schools have had formal training.  Approximately \nonethird of the total of all grade 6 students repeat in the hope of scoring well enough to be \noffered a place in one of the more prestigious secondary schools. The emphasis is on an \nacademic program from the primary to the upper secondary and tertiary levels. Educational \nachievement  raises  the  social  status  of  both  the  individual  and  his/her  family.  It  provides \nopportunities  for  emigration.  There  has  been  a  shift  in  migration  opportunities  away  from \nunskilled labor towards skilled workers with technical and professional qualifications. Higher \neducation also enables entry to employment in the public service, which is considered the most \nprestigious employment at all levels of the service. \n \n21.  Health.  Tonga has a high standard of health compared with other lower-middle income \ncountries, with an infant mortality rate of just over 14 per 1,000 live births in 1999. All members \nof the public have access to health services and essential drugs at not more than one hour\u2019s \ndistance  from  home.  Investments  in  water  and  sanitation  have  reduced  the  incidence \nprevalence of infectious diseases to low levels; immunization coverage is 92.4%; and maternal \nand child health coverage is excellent. Tonga has four hospitals\u2014one large and three small \nfacilities\u20144 health centers, and 33 maternal and child health centers. \n \n22.  Obesity,  diabetes,  and  cardiovascular  disease  are  becoming  major  national  health \nproblems. There is now a 13% diabetes prevalence rate, affecting increasing numbers of people \nin younger age groups. Car accidents are also an increasing cause of death and disability, and \ncancer and mental illness rates appear to be increasing. Diabetes is associated with many \ndisease complications including blindness and renal and cardiovascular diseases, which are \nvery costly to treat. Diet is a factor. There is a high dependence on imported foods including \nstaples such as flour and rice. Low-grade fatty imported meat and poultry products such as \nmutton flaps and turkey tails are widely consumed because they are relatively cheap. Health \npriority area plans focus on the prevention/reduction of these health problems.  \n \nC.  Assessing the Impact of Reforms under the EPSRP \n23.  The EPSRP envisages (i) continuation of the existing freeze on new appointments to the \npublic service, (ii) enforcement of the retirement age of 60, and (iii) provision of lump sum \nincentive payments to encourage employees over 50 to take early retirement. Currently, 79 \npublic servants in established posts are over 60 years, and 516 are over 50 years of age.16 \nPublic service regulations require retirement at age 60, but the rule is not enforced. It is not \nknown how many government workers employed on a daily basis (752 in all) are in these age \ngroups. Under the EPSRP, those positions that have been filled for long periods of time by \nemployees on a daily basis will be established, so that the employees holding the posts will be \nentitled to pensions and early retirement benefits if they are in the eligible age groups.  \n \n24.  A retirement fund for public servants covers workers in the public sector. Under the old \npension scheme, employees had the option of retiring with a pension or a lump sum. The new \nscheme only provides lump sum payments. The Government has a liability of about T$30 million \nto the pension fund, which might constrain its ability to meet a sudden increase in demand for \nlump sum payments, as would occur if it rapidly downsized in the public service. Loan proceeds \nhave been specially earmarked to cover retirement benefits and compensation payments.  \n \n                                                 \n16 No gender disaggregation of these figures has been done yet. ", "  Appendix 4  47 \n25.  The following potential socioeconomic impacts need to be monitored over the next 5 \nyears to ensure that mitigating policies can be adopted as required.  \n \n26.  Vulnerable Groups. The major socioeconomic impact over the next 2 to 3 years is likely \nbe a reduction in income of approximately 500 or more households due to retirement, early \nretirement, or retrenchment with compensation.  Households vulnerable to poverty are those \nwith only one income earner who retires from public service employment, especially those who \nown no land or are headed by women.17  \n \n27.  Research  conducted  by  the  Central  Planning  Department  (CPD)  under  the  Prime \nMinister\u2019s Office (PMO) and the Department of Statistics indicates that lump sum payments do \nnot provide long-term social security for retirees. A survey of people, who had received cash \nlump sum payments for retirement or compensation showed that 95% of them spent the money, \ngave it away, repaid debts, or made an unsuccessful investment.  \n \n28.  In households where the retrenched sole income earner is on a low salary scale and/or \nwhere the household has limited access to land, the hardship will be greatest. Lump sum \npension payouts and severance payments will be made to public sector employees taking early \nretirement or who are made redundant, but the amount will be small for those who had held low-\nwage positions.  A modest increase in those living below or close to the poverty line is a likely \noutcome.  \n \n29.  Assuming that Tonga\u2019s strong customs of family assistance will cushion the impact of \nreduced public sector expenditure and provide traditional social safety net functions, the high \ndependency ratio will continue to rise. Those in employment in Tonga will have increased \nfinancial obligations, and the demand on relatives working overseas will increase. \n \n30.  Gender Impacts. No analysis of the gender composition of the public service has been \nmade yet. According to the 1996 census, there were more women (8%) than men (6.8%) in the \noccupational  category  officers,  managers,  and  professionals,  but  women  predominated  in \nclerical positions (13.6% of the female labor force were clerks, compared with 4.6% of the male \nlabor force). If lower wage positions are made redundant, then women will be disproportionately \naffected.  \n \n31.  Unemployment.  By  encouraging  the  retirement  of  older  members  of  the  service, \nyounger  women  and  men  will  benefit  from  a  streamlined  public  service  with  increased \nopportunities  for  mobility.  However  the  public  service  will  no  longer  provide  as  many \nemployment opportunities as in the past. Postsecondary training will have to be more closely \nmatched to labor market opportunities and support growth in the private sector. Table A4.1 \ngives an overview of the impact of reform measures and proposed mitigation and monitoring \nactivities. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n17 The number of vulnerable households is not yet known and depends on the combination of measures taken to \nreduce the salary and wage bill.

Social and Gender Monitoring of EPSRP \n \n32.  The tasks of the economic and social impact monitoring unit established under the \nEPSRP  will  include  (i)  identification  of  the  social  and  gender  impacts  of  the  EPSRP  by \nestablishing baseline data on the key issues referred to above, and monitoring changes over the \nnext 5 years; (ii) collection of relevant data from government agencies and other sources; (iii) \ncarrying out special studies if required, and if important data gaps exist; (iv) analysis of policy \nimplications of social and gender impacts; (v) production of monthly reports to be submitted \nthrough the reform secretariat and the cabinet committee on reform to the Cabinet; (vi) provision \nof  information  to  the  public  to  encourage  stakeholder  participation,  endorsement,  and \ncooperation with the reform agenda; and (vii) organization, coordination, and monitoring of \nmitigation measures.  \n \n33.  CPD currently performs functions consistent with social and gender monitoring. The \npopulation and human resources development unit in CPD conducts socioeconomic research \nand collects and disseminates data for national planning and policy development purposes, \nincluding contributing to the CPD Economic and Social Bulletin, published twice yearly. It is \nenvisaged  that  social  and  gender  monitoring  of  the  EPSRP  will  become  an  additional \nresponsibility of CPD.   \n \nE.  Mitigation Measures \n \n34.  In  addition  to  financial  compensation  packages  for  voluntary  early  retirees  and \nredundancies, a range of nonfinancial mitigation measures will be available. It is likely that up to \n500 people will opt for training as part of a retirement/redundancy package over 3 years. The \neconomic and social impact monitoring unit will establish the training needs of early retirees and \nretrenched public servants. It is anticipated that training requirements will focus on four areas: (i) \nsmall business management; (ii) farm management with technical agricultural content; (iii) basic \naccounting and bookkeeping; and (iv) computer applications, office management, and office \nautomation.  \n \n35.  To be effective, courses should last approximately 16 weeks. It is estimated that the \nnumber of people eligible for retraining will be around 500. The cost is estimated at around \nUS$500 per person, assuming that courses are offered by local providers or by the University of \nthe South Pacific (USP). Following on these estimates, if 500 people were trained, the total cost \nwould be around US$250,000. A training allowance in the range of US$50 per week of training \nwill be considered.  \n \n36.  Pension payouts and compensation packages are paid in lump sums. Prudent financial \nmanagement  practices  will  be  needed  to  make  these  funds  last.  The  objective  of  person \nfinancial management training is to avoid poverty and ensure public welfare through a more \neffective use of family income. This will be achieved through a training and awareness program \nthat will involve both rural and urban families throughout the country. Because of cultural factors \nand customary communal obligations and pressures, targeting only those who will be leaving \npublic service employment will not be effective. It will be necessary to achieve a broad-based \nunderstanding among the families of people leaving government employment, and the general \npublic as well, of how improved financial management at the household level can avoid poverty \nand increase social security.  \n ", "  Appendix 4  51 \n37.  The following training providers and programs illustrate the range of existing training \nprograms that  can be utilized in retraining of retrenched public servants. The programs are \noffered by PMO, the Ministry of Education, and USP. \n \n38.  The  Government  Training  and  Development  Unit  (TDU)  under  the  Department  of \nEducation was established with an initial focus on improving the skills of public servants. From \n1994  on,  this  focus  was  broadened  to  include  the  private  sector  and  NGOs  through  two \npackages of assistance from the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID)  of \nUS$250,000 per annum,  and the New Zealand Ministry for Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) of \nUS$125,000 per annum. In addition, for the past three years, TDU has provided management \nand a venue for an in-service diploma in public sector management taught by Massey University \nand funded by MFAT. TDU is also planning to offer on-line distance education courses from the \nIllawarra Institute of Technical and Further Education in Australia. TDU also manages New \nZealand training attachment programs funded by MFAT. The Government states its priorities for \ntraining each year, and course offerings are planned in advance. Requests are sought and \nreceived  from  government  departments,  the  private  sector,  and  NGOs.  There  is  an \nunderstanding among the Government, AusAID, and MFAT that training needs of retired or \nretrenched public servants will be given priority when annual course programs are compiled.  \n \n39.  The Distance Education and Community Center specializes in computer and information \ntechnology  training,  and  is  administered  under  the  Ministry  of  Education\u2019s  Community \nDevelopment and Training Center. It also offers diploma courses in agriculture, accounting and \ntourism.    The  ministry  subsidizes  fees.  The  center  specializes  in  short-term  software \napplications  courses.  The  courses  are  available  to  part-time  students,  and  the  duration  is \nbetween  10  and  20  hours  per  course.  Applications  taught  include  Microsoft  Word,  Excel, \nAccess, Power Point, and Desktop Publisher.  \n \n40.  USP has a large extension center in Tonga with well-equipped offices and classrooms.  \nApproximately 300 part-time and full-time fee-paying students enroll each year in continuing \neducation courses; university preparatory courses (preliminary and foundation); and certificate, \ndiploma  and  degree-level  programs  in  a  wide  range  of  subjects  including  social  science, \neconomics, accounting, management, science, mathematics, and education. \n \n41.  Continuing education covers a variety of activities, some of which change from year to \nyear  depending  on  demand  and  the  availability  of  trainers.  The  mandate  for  continuing \neducation activities to be offered by USP is broad; however, the staff and resources allocated to \nthe USP center encourage a focus on higher level programs, mainly offered in the distance \neducation mode, or, less frequently, taught in intensive summer schools.  Continuing education \nprograms have included computing and other vocational skills.  Some continuing education \nprograms such as the Pacific Preschool Certificate18 are centrally organized at the USP in Suva, \nand offered through the distance education mode in Tonga and throughout the Pacific region \nserved by USP. Contact teaching is usually organized after hours to enable people with jobs to \nattend classes. \n \n42.  USP is able to tailor-make  courses  to   be  offered  at  the continuing education level for \nsponsored   groups    of   students   requiring  specific  vocational    training   qualifications.  The \nadvantage  of   such  programs  through  USP  is that  motivated students  may  cross-credit the \ncourses toward further study for higher level qualification. \n                                                 \n18 The Pacific Preschool Certificate was designed to train teachers employed in community-based preschools. The \nadmission criteria are low, mainly requiring students to be proficient in English. \n ", "52  Appendix 5 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR BUILDING A PERFORMANCE-BASED PUBLIC SERVICE \nA.  Background and Rationale \n \n1.  A  major  part  of  the  Government\u2019s  policy  reform  program  is  the  initiative  to  build  a \nperformance-based public service. The need for public service reform has long been recognized. \nPublic service reform committees were established in 2000 and have reported on (i) the core \nfunctions of the Government as prescribed by existing laws and regulations, (ii) a plan for public \nservice reform, and (iii) means of implementation. The task for the Government is to formulate an \nimplementation plan of sequenced and meaningful policy actions that is commensurate with \nadministrative capacity. Public service reform is aimed at reducing the size and costs of the public \nservice while maintaining and improving service delivery. Its successful implementation is crucial \nto  fiscal  balance,  improved  governance,  and  effective  economic  policy  reform.  The  Prime \nMinister\u2019s Office (PMO) is responsible for the formulation and implementation of public service \nreform. However, the Government needs to build its capacity to manage the public service reform, \nincluding monitoring of the impact of the reform measures.  \n \nB.  The Technical Assistance \n \n1.  Objective and Scope  \n \n2.  The overall public service reform seeks to improve public service delivery to the private \nsector and the general public. The technical assistance (TA) will support this overall goal. It has \nas  its  objective  to  build  a  performance-oriented  public  service  through  (i)  establishing  the \ninstitutional framework for a performance-oriented public service, and (ii) promoting efficient and \neffective performance management. The TA will (i) facilitate good governance practices and \nstrengthen the planning, monitoring, and reporting capabilities of all ministries; (ii) establish the \ncentral human resource management information system (HRMIS) to provide users with timely, \naccurate and relevant establishment information; (iii) introduce performance accountability for \nheads of departments; (iv) support the introduction of performance-oriented and merit-based \nremuneration policies and procedures; and (v) assist in the preparation of regulations and \nimplementation guidelines  for new legislation under the Economic and Public Sector Reform \nProgram  (EPSRP).  The  TA  will  cooperate  closely  with  the  assistance  provided  for  the \nestablishment of a public service commission by the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs \nand Trade.   \n \n  2.  Costs and Financing  \n \n3.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be US$840,000 equivalent, including a foreign \nexchange cost of US$676,000 and a local currency cost of US$164,000 equivalent. The Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  will  finance  US$700,000  equivalent  to  cover  the  entire  foreign \nexchange cost and US$24,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. Financing will come from the \nADB-funded TA program. The Government will contribute US$140,000 equivalent in kind for office \nspace, counterpart staff, local transportation, and other services.   \n \n3.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n4.  PMO will be the Executing Agency for the TA and will be the owner of all equipment upon \nTA completion.
