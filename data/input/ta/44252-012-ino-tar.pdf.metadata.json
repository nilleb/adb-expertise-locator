INTRODUCTION \n1.  To realize a more advanced and prosperous Indonesia, the government targeted an \naverage annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate of 6.3%\u20136.8% and a decline in the \npoverty rate to below 10% under its National Medium-Term Development Plan for 2010\u20132014. \nTo achieve these goals, the government will need total aggregate investment of Rp12,000\u2013\nRp13,000 trillion over this same timeframe. Much of this investment needs to be intermediated \nthrough the financial sector. The Capital Market Development Program Cluster and ongoing \ntechnical assistance (TA) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) have provided significant \nsupport to develop the nonbank financial sector in Indonesia by strengthening institutions and \nenhancing the capital markets.1 ADB\u2019s Financial Market Development and Integration Program \n(FMDIP), and this capacity development TA will build on these achievements to further deepen \nand diversify the nonbank financial sector to ensure the government can meet its aggregate \ninvestment targets.2 The FMDIP and this TA have been incorporated into the first strategic pillar \nof ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for 2012\u20132014, which is inclusive growth, and reflect the \ngovernment\u2019s reliance on the financial sector to support economic growth and development. \nADB\u2019s continuing assistance in developing the country\u2019s nonbank financial sector recognizes \nthe large unfinished reform agenda, the government\u2019s strong commitment to reform in this area, \nand the government\u2019s specific request for ADB to remain engaged in the sector throughout the \ncurrent country partnership strategy period. The impact, outcome, and outputs of the TA reflect \nthe findings of consultations with the government during the processing of the FMDIP, as well \nas the recommendations of an ADB TA project designed to identify constraints to increasing \nliquidity in the government bond market.3 Other facets of the TA have been discussed with and \nreflect the priorities of the executing agency and the implementing agencies. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  ADB  support  for  nonbank  financial  sector  development  in  Indonesia  has  produced \nmeasurable results. Assistance provided by ADB to strengthen the capacity of Bapepam-LK has \nimproved standards and made supervision of the financial markets more effective. CLSA Asia-\nPacific Markets\u2019 Corporate Governance Watch for 2010 noted that \u2015market participants and \nregulators are genuinely becoming more serious about enforcement\u2016.5 A primary dealer system \nhas been established, benchmark consolidation is continuing, and a reliable risk-free yield curve \nis emerging. The pension and insurance subsectors exhibit promising trends  as insurance \npremiums  relative  to  GDP  now  exceed  2.5%  and  are  approaching  the  level  of  insurance \npenetration in Thailand. The corporate bond market, while still very small, is also exhibiting \nencouraging trends and was one of the fastest-growing markets in Southeast Asia during 2010 \nand  2011.  Nevertheless,  the  local  currency  markets  in  government  and  corporate  bonds \nrepresent, in the aggregate,  less than 15% of GDP. By comparison, the bond markets  in \nMalaysia and Thailand exceed 65% of GDP. \n \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2009.

Hong Kong, China. \n ", "2   \n3.  A number of development constraints have continued to restrain growth in the financial \nmarkets. First, the \u2015twin silo\u2016 approach to financial sector supervision exhibits a number of \nweaknesses. The banking sector is regulated by Bank Indonesia, the country\u2019s central bank \nwhile the capital markets, insurance, and nonbank financial sectors are regulated by Bapepam-\nLK. This means that regulation of financial conglomerates is bifurcated and cannot be applied \non a consolidated basis. Regulations covering one part of the financial sector often constrain \ndevelopment in the other. Disparate access to resources and the lack of qualified immunity for \nnonbank regulators has produced an uneven application of supervision which is susceptible to \narbitrage.  Responsibility  for  financial  sector  development  is  likewise  split  between  the  two \nregulators and the Ministry of Finance\u2019s Fiscal Policy Office (FPO). The end results of these \nissues include a lack of coordinated development, low investor confidence, and limited domestic \nparticipation in the capital markets. An increase in foreign capital inflows due to an upgrade in \nIndonesia\u2019s credit rating has made the need to address these problems and modernize the \nsupervision of financial markets even more urgent.  \n \n4.  Government debt issuance continues and the outstanding debt stock has increased. \nHowever, the size of the debt market, relative to GDP, has declined as the pace of issuance has \nnot mirrored the growth in the economy. This situation has been exacerbated by the fact that \nhalf  of  the  outstanding  government  debt  stock  is  thinly  traded  or  not  tradable.  Market \nparticipants currently have no effective hedging mechanisms such as repurchase agreements, \nfor example, and no derivatives. This forces market participants to close positions rapidly in \nresponse to nominal events and creates a feedback loop of elevated volatility. The FMDIP \nestablishes a framework to increase the stock of tradable government debt by converting bank \nrecapitalization bonds into government debt. However, more needs to be done to help develop \nmore efficiently functioning primary and secondary government debt markets and to boost the \nrole of the contractual savings subsector as a source of domestic demand for capital markets \nproducts.  The  contractual  savings  subsector  needs  to  migrate  to  more  advanced  portfolio \nmanagement methodologies but is constrained from doing so by an acute shortage of trained \nrisk management professionals, including actuaries. \n \n5.  To  address these  issues,  the government  has  made  it  a  priority  to  strengthen the \nfinancial sector\u2019s infrastructure and assure investors of stability and proper governance. It has \nbegun to harmonize supervision across the financial sector, reduce regulatory arbitrage, and \nimprove the overall competence and integrity of supervision. Under the FMDIP, the government \nwill  launch  an  independent,  unified financial  sector  regulator through  the  newly  authorized \nIntegrated Financial Services Authority (OJK). OJK will start operations on 1 January 2013, and \nbank supervision to be transferred from Bank Indonesia to OJK by the end of 2013. Legally, \nOJK will be fiscally and operationally independent from government. It will be governed by a \nboard of commissioners that will have full control over the budget, which will be financed by fees \nand  levies  currently  applied  to  the  financial  sector.  The  FMDIP  also  includes  support  for \nsignificant revisions to the three primary sector laws governing capital markets, insurance, and \npensions. This is intended to provide a legal framework for harmonized supervision, as well as \nsupervisory immunity and the power to resolve problem institutions. \n \n6.  While the establishment of OJK represents a landmark in the government\u2019s reform \nefforts, broad-based TA will be necessary to ensure its success. Support will be needed to \nensure rapid integration of diverse corporate cultures within the new organization so that it can \nexercise  its  regulatory  function  effectively.  The  operational  and  procedural  standards  OJK \nadopts will have to reflect international sound practices. In addition, the creation of OJK has \ntriggered FPO\u2019s emergence as the Government\u2019s designated agency for coordinating financial \nsector policy. Specifically, the FPO\u2019s responsibilities will now expand beyond fiscal matters to \n ", "  3 \ninclude high-level coordination of financial sector development and stability. The FPO will also \nassume a new role as executing agency for ADB loans and TA. This will provide FPO and ADB \nmore flexibility to address a wider range of development constraints, including taxation issues, \nwhich had proven challenging under Bapepam-LK. To ensure a smooth transition across all \naffected agencies, FPO will require a rapid build-up of technical capacity. 6 It will need these \nskills to maintain the existing momentum of financial sector reform and to exercise its expanded \nmandate efficiently and effectively. Given the central role ADB has played in promoting these \nreforms, it is critical that ADB provide TA support to both OJK and the FPO to assure the \ngovernment of ADB\u2019s commitment to the continuing development of the financial sector. \n \n7.  Concurrent  efforts  are  also  needed  to  develop  the  domestic  debt  markets  and  to \nencourage domestic investors to participate in the capital markets. ADB TA must continue \nsupport to ongoing reforms under the government\u2019s Capital Market and Nonbank Financial \nIndustry Master Plan (CMNMP) for 2010\u20132014. Many of these reforms are currently being \nsupported by ADB and are complex and technically challenging. ADB is currently providing real-\ntime  technical  advice  to  senior  policy  makers  through  an  onsite  resident  advisor.  This \nassistance has been directly responsible for a number of key reforms completed under the \nFMDIP and will be continued. Further, specific steps are needed to encourage broader and \ndeeper  participation  in  the  government  debt  market.  Basic  inventory  management  tools, \nincluding the Global Master Repurchase Agreement (GMRA) and interest rate derivatives, must \nbe provided to support the efforts of primary dealers to make two-way markets. These tools, \nwhich  will  strengthen  risk  management  and  reduce  volatility,  will  foster  a  more  active \nGovernment debt issuance program. In conjunction with these efforts, the tax code applicable to \nthe financial system as well as specific financial transactions must be modified to provide the \nproper incentives to support financial sector development.  \n \n8.  Finally, efforts are needed to raise awareness of the important role played by contractual \nsavings  in  financial  sector  development  and  economic  growth.  Financial  literacy  must  be \nimproved  both  within  and  outside  of  the  government  to  reduce  entrenched  resistance  to \ncoordinating efforts to develop Indonesia\u2019s financial system. In addition, the reforms already \nimplemented under the FMDIP must now be further supported by building technical capacity in \nthe  sector.  Developing  greater  actuarial  and  risk  management  capacity  in  the  insurance \nsubsector is particularly important, because this will lead to enhanced returns and provide more \ndiverse choices to investors. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n9.  The  TA  will  build  on  key  reforms  initiated  under  the  FMDIP  and  will  support  the \ngovernment\u2019s initial efforts to develop OJK as a world class financial regulator. The TA will also \nprovide  long-term  support  to  the  continuing  implementation  of  select  activities  within  the \nCMNMP that aim to deepen the capital market. Finally, the TA will support the government\u2019s \nefforts  to  increase  the  demand  for  domestic  capital  market  instruments.  It  will  do  this  by \nreducing resistance to the coordinated development of the traditional capital markets and the \ncontractual  savings  sector. The TA  will  also  strengthen  the  nonlife  insurance  sector\u2019s  risk \nmanagement capacity. \n \n                                                \n6  The transition will directly affect FPO, Bapeman-LK, and OJK due to the establishment of new and revised \nmandates. However, additional indirect effects will arise through FPO\u2019s new mandate to coordinate high level \nfinancial sector policy. For example, FPO will need to develop a basic working knowledge of financial sector \nsupervision, taxation, investment incentives and other fiscal matters. \n ", "4   \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The impact of the TA will be increased domestic participation in the nonbank finance \nsubsector. The outcome of the TA will be enhanced financial sector development. To achieve \nthis impact and outcome, the TA will have three outputs: (i) strengthened regulatory oversight, \n(ii) improved market infrastructure, and (iii) increased growth in contractual savings. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  Output 1: Strengthened regulatory oversight. The TA will continue support to a key \nADB sponsored policy reform that established OJK. Specifically, the TA project will provide \nhigh-level technical advice to senior policy makers in OJK to guide the formulation of the \ninstitution\u2019s organizational structure and corporate culture, governance, operations and staffing. \nCapacity  development  will  also  be  provided  to  strengthen  select  areas  of  financial  sector \nsupervision that will be identified during the transition process. The TA will also help strengthen \nthe  FPO\u2019s  ability  to  coordinate  financial  sector  development  strategies,  to  conduct  macro \nprudential supervision, and to develop and implement crisis management protocols. Finally, the \nTA  will  support  efforts  to  draft  implementing  regulations  for  the  three  revised  sector  laws \ngoverning the capital markets, pensions, and insurance sectors. The revision of these sector \nlaws,  which  will  provide  for  supervisory  immunity  and  the  power  to  resolve  problematic \ninstitutions, was a policy action under the FMDIP. Drafts of these revised laws have been \ncompleted and socialized and are programmed for parliamentary review over the period 2013-\n2015. \n \n12.  Output  2:  Improved  market  infrastructure.  The  TA  will  continue  to  help  the \ngovernment promote financial sector development by providing high-level technical advice to \nsenior policy makers in OJK and the FPO. The TA will also support specific CMNMP initiatives, \nincluding  coordinated  efforts  by  market  stakeholders  to  deepen  the  capital  markets.  In \nparticular, the TA will support government efforts to establish market makers to enable the \neventual introduction of exchange traded funds and basic hedging instruments to manage \ninterest rate and currency risks. The TA will also provide ancillary support to the ongoing ADB \nproject to introduce the Global Master Repurchase Agreement to Indonesia and will provide \nevaluations and supportable recommendations to rationalize the tax code covering financial \nproducts  and  transactions. 7  In  addition,  the  TA  will  provide  continuing  support  to  the \ngovernment\u2019s initiative to establish standards of market conduct. \n \n13.  Output 3: Increased growth in contractual savings. The TA will seek to increase \ndomestic demand from the contractual savings subsector for capital market instruments by \nfostering greater cooperation among stakeholders. Specifically, this initiative will seek to foster a \nmore unified approach to financial sector development by sponsoring research in Indonesia\u2019s \nuniversities into the linkages between contractual savings, capital market development, and \neconomic growth. The best of the research papers produced will be published by ADB and will \nserve as a domestic catalyst to foster a greater alignment of stakeholder interests. The TA will \nalso enhance risk management in the insurance sector which is a prerequisite to introducing \nmore effective asset allocation methodologies. Specifically, this activity will develop a formal \nplatform through which professionals can acquire the basic actuarial skills needed to strengthen \nand eventually consolidate the less-efficient nonlife insurance segment. This activity will also \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2009.

ADB  is  consulting  with  stakeholders,  including  donor \npartners, industry associations, regulators and academia to ensure this activity is sustainable \nover the long-term.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, of which $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis  by  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction.  The  government  will  provide  counterpart \nsupport in the form of counterpart staff, office accommodations, local phone and fax services, \nbasic office supplies, and other in-kind contributions. The cost estimates and financing plan are \npresented in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  The executing agency will be the FPO, reflecting the agency\u2019s new responsibility for \nfinancial  sector  stability  and  for  establishing  and  coordinating  broad  financial  sector \ndevelopment strategies across government agencies. The TA reflects the key importance of this \nrole, and $188,000, or 19% of the total TA budget, is to be allotted to support the FPO. The \ndiversity of the implementing agencies reflects the broad cooperation that will be necessary to \nimplement some of the more technically challenging reforms the TA will support. They will be (i) \nthe  FPO,  the  Directorate  General  of  Debt  Management,  and  the  Directorate  General  of \nTaxation\u2014all under the Ministry of Finance; (ii) Bank Indonesia; (iii) the Indonesian Stock \nExchange; (iv) the Indonesian Clearing and Guarantee Corporation; and (v) the Indonesian \nCentral Securities Depository. The implementation period will be from 1 February 2013 to 31 \nJanuary 2015. \n \n16.  The packaging of the consulting services will be based on the expressions of interest \nsolicited from qualified consulting firms and individual consultants. These services may involve \none or several packages and a combination of firms and individuals. ADB will hire consulting \nfirms through quality- and cost-based selection (80:20), according to its Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Individual consultants will be recruited \nusing the individual consultant selection method. In lieu of direct support, the TA will organize \nand  coordinate  the  research  projects  and  will  provide  a  platform  for  their  evaluation  and \npublication. The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. Disbursements \nunder the TA will conform to ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as \namended from time to time). The overall evaluation of the TA will be based on a comparison of \nactual results with the performance targets in the design and monitoring framework in Appendix \n1. TA review missions will be scheduled frequently to ensure a smooth transition to the FPO as \nADB\u2019s  executing  agency.  Knowledge  products  produced  in  accordance  with  a  knowledge \nproduct and communications plan will form part of the TA outputs.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $1,000,000  to  the \nGovernment of Indonesia to be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty \nReduction for Enhancing Financial Sector Governance, Risk Management, and Depth, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks  \nImpact  By 2016:    Assumption \nIncreased domestic  The level of domestic  DGDM periodic reports  Market volatility does \nparticipation in the  ownership of tradable    not significantly reduce \nnonbank finance  government securities    risk appetite of \nsubsector  increases to 75%    investors. \n(2012 baseline: 60%)     \n    Risks \nProportion of government  DGDM periodic reports  Continuity of reforms is \nbonds held by the  OJK annual report  lost in the transition to \ndomestic contractual  the FPO as ADB \nsavings subsector  executing agency. \nincreases to 32%   \n(2012 baseline: 25%)  Investment grade credit \nrating causes capital \ninflows to increase \nfaster than domestic \nabsorption of \ngovernment bonds. \nOutcome  By 2014:    Assumption \nFinancial sector  OJK initiates operations  OJK annual report  Government \ndevelopment  and completes absorption    commitment to reform \nenhanced  of bank supervision    remains high and \n    cooperation is achieved \nCMNMP at least 60%  OJK annual report  with the regulator and \ncomplete, including key  between agencies. \nobjectives as follows;   \nprocedures for public  Risk \nofferings streamlined,  Proposed reforms are \nGMRA launched, IPF  not completed within \nestablished, corporate  established time \ngovernance standards  frames. \nstrengthened, \nconvergence with IAS and \nlaunch of straight-through \nprocessing \n(2012 baseline: 30%) \nOutputs  By 2014:    Assumptions \n    Sponsor governments \n1.
