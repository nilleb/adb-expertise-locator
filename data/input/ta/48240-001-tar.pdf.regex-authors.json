INTRODUCTION \n1.  The spread of information and communication technology (ICT) has promoted a more \nconnected, networked, and interdependent world. ICT has made a substantial contribution to \neconomic growth and has empowered populations by lowering development costs, reducing \ncorruption and inefficiency, and improving quality in government delivery of essential services. It \nhas also promoted more transparent and more affordable access to such services.  \n \n2.  Developing member countries (DMCs) need to increase ICT access for underserved \npopulations if the digital divide in Asia and the Pacific is to be bridged. Just one-third of DMC \nhouseholds have internet access, and the costs of broadband connections are very high. In \nmany  countries,  ICT  for  development  (ICTD)  is  hampered  by  a  lack  of  adequate  ICT \ninfrastructure, insufficient government support for partnering with the private sector to provide \nICT infrastructure,  and poorly performing universal access policies.1 Large  populations \nresiding in rural and geographically remote areas have little access to digital technology and \nto the benefits that connectivity can bring. \n \n3.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) recognizes the growing importance of ICT for \ndevelopment and has introduced ICT components in a large number of projects across all \nsectors and thematic areas of support. The Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 states that ADB \nwill use ICT more effectively in projects to improve development impact, and will utilize ICT to \nimprove access to finance in the DMCs.2 It also calls for ADB to increase adoption of innovative \nand catalytic solutions to meet the needs of DMCs, most of which have reached middle-income \nstatus. Integrating ICT and e-solutions into ADB\u2019s assistance is one of the ways in which ADB \ncan provide an innovative response to DMC needs. In line with Strategy 2020 priorities, access \nto ICT needs to be improved in underserved parts of the region, and e-solutions must be utilized \nto make ADB more relevant to the needs of its middle-income DMCs. This technical assistance \n(TA) will contribute to the identification and operationalization of potential ICTD interventions in \nADB operations.   \n \n4.  In April 2014, ADB and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) launched the \nICT for  Development  in  the  Asia  and  Pacific Region  (ICTD-ASP) Initiative,  which  aims  to \n(i) provide advisory support for prioritization of ICTD investments and pre-feasibility studies \n(PFSs) on high-priority ICTD investment projects, (ii) mobilize resources and facilitate ICTD \ninvestment through coordinated partnerships among stakeholders, and (iii) enhance institutional \nICTD capacity via sharing experiences and knowledge on ICTD in Asia and the Pacific.3 Under \nthis initiative, ADB and ITU will collaborate to assist the Asia-Pacific countries in designing, \nplanning,  implementing,  and  monitoring  their  ICTD  strategies  and  programs.  A  fact-finding \nmission was carried out in October 2014, where key design issues related to the partnership \narrangement of the ICTD-ASP Initiative were discussed with ITU. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n5.  Many DMC governments have adopted ICT strategies, plans, e-readiness assessments, \nand e-governance programs. However, the ability of governments to translate these into action \nis  hampered  by  inadequate  financial  resources,  insufficient  managerial  and  ICT  technical \n                                                \n1 ICTD is the use of ICT to advance socioeconomic development and improve human well-being. \n2 ADB. 2014. Midterm Review of Strategy 2020: Meeting the Challenges of a Transforming Asia and Pacific. Manila \n3 The  ITU is  a  specialized  United  Nations  agency  for  ICT.  It  has  193 member states,  567 sector members, \n159 associates, and 60 member academic institutions. It is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, and has four \nregional offices, including one for Asia and the Pacific. \n ", "2 \ncompetence, weak ICT regulatory regimes and public\u2013private partnership arrangements, and \ninadequate institutional capacity to prepare ICT projects.  \n \n6.  ADB support for ICTD initiatives could be enhanced if DMCs had greater understanding \nof ICT needs and requirements. It is important that ICTD programs be identified when ADB \ncountry strategies and operations business plans are being prepared\u2014since ADB\u2019s country \nteams may not be aware of potential ICTD opportunities. In 2014, the Regional and Sustainable \nDevelopment Department (RSDD) began collaborating with regional departments to carry out \ncountry-specific assessments of ICT opportunities for ADB in three DMCs. Such assessments \ncould be carried out in more countries to enhance ADB\u2019s understanding of members\u2019 ICT \nrequirements, and to integrate these into ADB\u2019s pipeline of country support.4    \n \n7.  From 2000 to 2012, ADB supported 444 ICT-related projects. Most of these projects \nwere prepared in isolation. No systematic coordination mechanisms have been developed for \nthe identification and design of ICT projects, and no significant ADB-wide ICT initiatives have \nbeen replicated and scaled up across the region. Some TA projects have focused on developing \ngovernment capacity to prepare good ICT projects and programs. 5 However, the TA projects \nhave generally not been directly connected to ADB operations.  \n \n8.  In many sectors and thematic areas, ADB lacks the capacity to identify and design \nrelevant ICTD projects. However, many development partners  have ample experience and \nexpertise in ICTD. ADB must collaborate with these development partners to (i) meet growing \nDMC demands for ICTD solutions, (ii) improve the design quality of innovative ICTD solutions in \noperations, (iii) help scale up and promote the sustainability of ICTD initiatives, (iv) promote \nknowledge sharing on ICTD, and (v) facilitate the mobilization of global expertise and financial \nresources for potential ICTD projects. \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n9.  The TA will assist DMCs to develop ICT projects that can be financed by ADB and by \nthe  DMCs  themselves  to  help  close  the  digital  divide.  It  will  be  aligned  with  the  country \npartnership strategy (CPS) and country operations business plans of participating DMCs, so \nthat ICT projects support specific ADB sector and thematic priorities in the participating DMCs.  \n \n10.  The TA will support implementation of the ICTD-ASP Initiative in collaboration with ITU, \na global center of excellence, and other partners in Asia and the Pacific. It will assist DMCs to \nimprove universal access policies and programs and to boost the supply of ICT infrastructure \nand ICT-enabled service delivery projects that are ready for financing. It will strengthen ADB\u2019s \nability to identify and finance ICTD projects. It will also contribute to building a network of public \n                                                \n4 As part of RSDD\u2019s initiative to mainstream ICT in ADB operations, it has prepared ADB. 2014. Promoting \nInformation and Communication Technology in ADB Operations. Manila. The report examined and identified \nopportunities for ICTD projects in key sector and thematic areas in ADB operations. RSDD undertook assessments \nof country ICT requirements for Mongolia (in February 2014) and Tajikistan (in July\u2013August 2014). A similar \nassessment of ICT requirements in Indonesia is planned for December 2014.   \n5 Past ICT TA projects include ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance for Improving Public Services through Information \nand  Communication  Technology.  Manila;  ADB.  2008.  Technical  Assistance  for  Rural  Information  and \nCommunication Technology Policy Advocacy, Knowledge Sharing, and Capacity Building. Manila. Ongoing ICT TA \nprojects include ADB. 2012. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for Improving Public \nAdministration  and  Services  Delivery  through  e-Solutions.  Manila;  ADB.  2013.

Manila. \n ", "  3 \nand private partners willing to invest in such projects. ITU and other partners of the ICTD-ASP \nInitiative will provide in-kind contributions for the TA implementation. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The  project\u2019s  impact  will  be  a  narrowing  of  the  digital  divide  and  improved  (ICT-\nenhanced) service delivery. The outcome will be increased governments\u2019 capacity to identify \nand prepare ICTD investments in DMCs. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will have five outputs: (i) country-level assessments of options for integrating ICT \nsupport in ADB\u2019s operations, (ii) PFSs on potential ICTD projects for DMCs, (iii) a partnership \nframework for resource mobilization on ICTD projects in DMCs, (iv) knowledge sharing and \ncapacity development programs, and (v) contents of a knowledge portal on ICTD. Detailed \nactivities and the implementation plan for each output are as follows. \n \n13.  Output 1. Diagnostic country studies will be undertaken to identify options for integrating \nICT  support  into  ADB  CPSs.  ICTD  diagnostic  studies  will  be  undertaken  to  support  CPS \npreparation over 2015\u20132017. Target countries for diagnostic country studies will be identified in \ncoordination with regional departments. Group A or Group B DMCs including Lao, PDR, Sri \nLanka, and Tajikistan will be prioritized as target countries. 6 One or two diagnostic studies of \nICTD options for ADB CPSs will be undertaken each year during the TA period.  \n \n14.  Output  2.  PFSs  will  cover  high-priority  ICT  investments  in  ADB\u2019s  key  sector  and \nthematic areas. Support will be provided to bring project designs to the point at which they can \nbe considered for funding. It is anticipated that these will be both public and public\u2013private \npartnership investments, and could cover issues such as extension of broadband connectivity, \npublic access internet facilities, e-government projects, smart city projects, and other ICT-based \ninterventions in other sectors. The PFSs will be identified on the basis of concept proposals \nsubmitted  by  DMC  governments  or  ADB  operational  departments.  The  Government  of \nCambodia has expressed its interest in receiving ADB technical support in developing a national \nidentify management program. The steering committee of the ICTD-ASP Initiative will review the \nconcept proposals in a batch once or twice per year. The aim will be to assist in the preparation \nof two to three PFSs per year, depending on demand and DMC readiness. 7   \n \n15.  Output 3. A partnership network and financing framework will be developed among \npotential public and private partners interested in financing ICTD initiatives. Development of the \nnetwork will facilitate cofinancing and ease financing constraints on public support for ICT \ninvestments. The partnership framework will be developed, customized, tested, and updated \nbased on the nature of the ICTD programs and projects to be financed.  \n \n16.  Output 4. Lessons from TA-supported efforts, and others in the region, to help close the \ndigital divide will be shared through a series of regional ICTD forums. These will highlight \nlessons from major ICTD initiatives and will facilitate knowledge cooperation on ICTD among \ndeveloping countries. Two regional ICTD forums will be held each year under the ICTD-ASP \n                                                \n6  A fact-finding mission has been made for Tajikistan in 2014 and both Sri Lanka and Lao PDR are scheduled to \ndevelop new CPSs in2015-2017. \n7 The steering committee is the decision-making body of the ICTD-ASP Initiative and comprises representatives of \nboth ADB and ITU, and any other major contributors to the initiative. \n ", "4 \nInitiative: (i) on e-service platforms, and (ii) on e-government. It is proposed that the two regional \nforums be hosted in 2015 by the Government of Thailand. \n \n17.  Output  5.  Contents  of  a knowledge  portal  on  ICTD  developed.  It  will facilitate the \nsharing of practical knowledge relevant to the design of projects and programs under the ICTD-\nASP Initiative. The knowledge portal will serve as a repository for good practices and lessons in \nICTD throughout Asia and the Pacific. It will be focused on the key topic areas under the ICTD-\nASP Initiative and will be supported by voluntary contributions of participating countries. The \ndetailed design and maintenance arrangements for the knowledge portal will be discussed and \ndeveloped during the regional ICTD forums. ADB will provide inputs on the contents of the \nwebsite and ITU will provide technical expertise on the website development and the physical \nplatform of the knowledge portal. \n \n18.  This TA will be implemented based on the following assumptions: (i) continuous strategic \npartnership  between  ADB  and  ITU,  (ii)  strong  support  from  relevant  stakeholders  from \nparticipating countries, and (iii) active involvement from concerned government agencies. \n \n19.  No adverse social or environmental concerns are foreseen. Since the TA does not \ninvolve any direct financial transactions with government agencies, no issues related to public \nfinancial management, procurement, and corruption are expected.  \n \n20.  A potential risk is lack of participation from potential partners as a result of changing \nfinancing  preferences  or  financial  difficulties  in  the  region.  This  risk  will  be  mitigated  by \nencouraging flexible implementation based on a range of options and partnership arrangements. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n21.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V) and $500,000 will be financed on \na  grant  basis  by  the  Republic  of  Korea  e-Asia  and  Knowledge  Partnership  Fund  and \nadministered by ADB. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n22.  ADB will be the executing agency. RSDD will implement the TA and provide a staff team \nto monitor and administer the individual contracts  regularly, and to manage the combined \noutputs  to  achieve  the  TA  objectives.  This  will  be  done  in  collaboration  with  operational \ndepartments for identification of target countries and strategic focus, the Office of Information \nSystems and Technology for technical support, and the Office of Cofinancing Operations for \ndiscussion with potential cofinancing partners. RSDD will coordinate with regional departments \nregarding any communication and/or consultation with participating DMCs. Concurrence of the \nparticipating governments will be obtained, as required. Government agencies and stakeholders \nin DMCs will submit ICT pre-feasibility project preparation and capacity development program \nrequests to the steering committee of the ICTD-ASP Initiative. After these are screened and \napproved by the steering committee, concurrence from the relevant operations department will \nbe obtained. Depending on the technical focus of the PFS, a small advisory panel of ADB and \nITU staff may be formed. For each subproject, an implementing agency will be identified.  \n \n23.  The  ICTD-ASP  Initiative  has  a  steering  committee,  secretariat,  and  regional \nstakeholders\u2019 forum: \n \n ", "  5 \n(i)  The steering committee is comprised of representatives of the major contributors \nto the initiative, including ADB and ITU. It will be the overall governing body of \nthe initiative and carries out the following tasks: (a) review and approval of the \nstrategic development plan; (b) review and approval of the initiative operational \nguidelines; and (c) review and approval of the initiative work plans, including \nproject proposals and annual reports. \n(ii)  The  secretariat  comprises  participating  focal  staff  from  ADB  and  ITU.  It  is \nresponsible for the day-to-day operation of the initiative, for which a specialized \nteam of consultants may be recruited in addition to the focal staff from ADB and \nITU. \n(iii)  A regional stakeholders\u2019 forum will be developed to track the progress of the \ninitiative, discuss the demand for the initiative services, provide reactions to the \ninitiative services rendered, and act as a forum for stakeholder dialogue on all \ninitiative matters. The regional stakeholders\u2019 forum will meet once or twice per \nyear in conjunction with the regional ICTD forum. \n \n24.  The  TA  will  provide  26  person-months  of  international  consultants  and  30  person-\nmonths of individual national consultants.8 A mixture of consulting firms or institutions and \nindividual consultants will be engaged by ADB following the quality- and cost-based selection \nmethod (90:10) and simplified technical proposals in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use \nof  Consultants  (2013, as  amended from time  to time). The  outline  terms  of reference for \nconsultants are in Appendix 3.  \n25.  All  disbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  the  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). Proposed activities \nwill comply with specific fund regulations, agreements and/or guidelines. \n \n26.  The TA will be implemented over 36 months, commencing in January 2015. The TA \ncompletion date is expected to be December 2017. \n \n27.  Under  the  TA,  a  monitoring  and  evaluation  framework,  with  clear  benchmarks  and \ntargets, and reporting requirements will be prepared.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION  \n \n28.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund, \nand (ii) ADB providing the balance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis \nfor Information and Communication Technology for Development Initiative Facility in Asia and \nthe Pacific, and hereby reports this action to the Board.   \n \n                                                \n8 In line with the action plan of the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020, output-based lump-sum contracts will be \nconsidered for consulting services. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n              Appendix 1\nPerformance Targets  Data Sources and \nand Indicators with  Reporting  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Baselines  Mechanisms   Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nA narrowing of the digital  Increased access to  Annual ITU report  Implementing \ndivide and improved  internet and broadband    agencies exhibit \n(ICT-enhanced) service  in the DMCs  Annual report of the  strong ownership of \ndelivery     Republic of Korea e- the TA projects. \nImproved quality of  Asia and Knowledge    \npublic services and  Partnership Fund  Sufficient funding and \nimproved ICT    support is provided to \ninfrastructure resulting  Official published  implement proposed \nfrom accelerated  reports or  ICT infrastructure and \ndiffusion of e-solutions in  announcements made  service delivery \nparticipating DMCs  by government  projects. \n  agencies in   \n  participating DMCs   \n  \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \nIncreased governments\u2019  At least three project  Annual report of the  Participating DMCs \ncapacity to identify and  proposals supported by  Republic of Korea e- accept and act on TA \nprepare ICTD  the TA are accepted by  Asia and Knowledge  findings and \ninvestments in DMCs  the funding authorities in  Partnership Fund  recommendations. \nDMCs by 2017     \n  Official published  Development partners \n  reports or  and the private sector \nannouncements made  are willing to \nby government  cooperate and \nagencies in  coordinate efforts in \nparticipating DMCs  ICTD initiatives.  \n \nOutputs       Assumptions \n1.

Two consultants will be engaged individually: a specialist in partnership strategy and \nevaluation, and a specialist in financing for development. Other consultants will be recruited as \nneeded. The TA will be implemented in a flexible manner, so the terms of reference, duration, \nand schedule of TA inputs will be subject to adjustment. Such adjustments may also need to be \nundertaken during implementation to meet capacity-building needs and to ensure that TA funds \nare utilized in a cost-effective manner. The terms of reference for the proposed TA will be fine-\ntuned during implementation. All consultants will be recruited in accordance with the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time \nto time).  \n \nB.
