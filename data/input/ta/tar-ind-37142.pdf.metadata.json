The Government of India requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide \ntechnical assistance (TA) for preparing ADB-financed projects under the Pradhan Mantri Bharat \nJodo Pariyojana (PMBJP), or the Prime Minister\u2019s national highway (NH) program for integrating \nIndia, a plan to upgrade 10,000 km of NHs. The Government and ADB reached an agreement \non the revision of the original TAs, included in the 2003 Country Strategy and Program for 2004 \nand 2005, under the titles of High Priority National Highways I and II. The original TAs were \ncombined to a single TA for preparing a series of projects in order to ensure adequate project \npreparation in advance of loan processing. Subsequently, the Fact-Finding Mission visited India \nfrom 23 February to 5 March 2004 and met with responsible officials of the concerned agencies, \nincluding  the  Department  of  Economic  Affairs,  Ministry  of  Road  Transport  and  Highways \n(MORTH), and National Highway Authority of India (NHAI). This TA was developed on the basis \nof  the  understanding  reached  during  the  mission  on  the  scope,  cost,  implementation \narrangements, and terms of reference for consultants.1   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  India's economic reforms have resulted in a real gross domestic product growth of \naround 6% through the 1990s, with an average growth rate of about 8% in the latter half of the \n1990s.  Although  the  growth  rate  was  much  less  during  the  last  2  years,  the  demand  for \ntransport is expected to grow at about 10% per year. The transport sector is multimodal, \ncomprising a road network, railway, ports, airports, and inland waterways. The road transport is \nthe dominant mode of transport, accounting for 70% of freight movement and 85% of passenger \ntraffic. The road network totals some 3.4 million kilometers (km), of which 65,569 km are NHs.2 \nThe network has grown 8.5 times, from 400,000 km in 1951. The NH network contributes to \nabout 1.9% of the country\u2019s road network, but carries about 40% of total traffic. Over the last \ndecade, the numbers of automobiles and heavy vehicles have increased at about 9% and 7.6%, \nrespectively. In 2002, India had 59 million vehicles.  \n \n3.  India\u2019s road density is now 1 km per square km of land, which compares favorably with \nmany developing countries. However, the standards and condition of the road network are \ninadequate to meet the rapidly growing demand for freight and passenger traffic. In early 2004, \nabout 31% of the network was single-lane, 63% two-lane, and only 6% four-lane or more. More \nthan 25% of NHs have poor surfaces, and many NHs are seriously congested. Internationally, a \ngoods vehicle travels on average 600\u2013800 km a day, while on Indian roads, until recently, the \naverage distance covered is only 250\u2013300 km a day. Poor road conditions have negative \nconsequences for road user costs, road safety, and the quality and frequency of transport \nservices. They also limit the contribution of roads to national development, economic growth, \nand poverty reduction. \n \n4.  Faced  with  the  highway  system\u2019s  chronic  capacity  shortage,  the  Government  has \ninitiated  radical  action,  including  (i)  launching  ambitious  national  highway  programs;  (ii) \nestablishing  the  NHAI;  (iii)  creating  a  central  road  fund;  and  (iv)  promoting  private  sector \nparticipation (PSP) in financing and executing upgrading, operation, and maintenance of NHs. \n \n5.  In  1998,  the  Government  launched  the  National  Highway  Development  Program \n(NHDP), aiming to rehabilitate and widen about 13,300 km of the (i) Golden Quadrilateral, \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 22 March 2004. \n2  The network of national highways totaled 58,112 km until February 2004 when 7,457 km were added. ", "2  \nconnecting  the  four  major  cities  of  Chennai,  Delhi,  Kolkata,  and  Mumbai;  (ii)  North-South \nCorridor;  and  (iii)  East-West  Corridor.    About  6,000  km  of  roads  have  been  substantially \ncompleted. In 2003, the Prime Minister announced the PMBJP, covering about 10,000 km, and \nconsisting of (i) high traffic density corridors, (ii) state capitals connectivity to the NHDP network, \nand (iii) access to tourist and economic centers.  \n \n6.  MORTH is responsible for developing and maintaining NHs; formulating road transport \npolicies; coordinating state roads; and issuing guidelines on highway planning, design, and \nconstruction. In 1988, the Government established NHAI, a statutory body under the NHAI Act, \nwith  initial  responsibility  for  the  construction  and  maintenance  of  the  NH  network  and \nexpressways relating to externally aided projects and PSP. In 1998, implementation of NHDP \nbecame NHAI\u2019s core responsibility. Recently, NHAI was also designated to execute the PMBJP.  \n \n7.  To develop the road network, a dedicated central road fund was established. Its major \nsource of funds are additional excise duties (the \u201ccess\u201d) of petrol and diesel, which initially was \nRs1.0 per liter and increased to Rs1.5 per liter in 2003. About one-third of the funds are \nallocated for NHs. These funds have been committed until 2018 to implement the NHDP and \npay debt service. The PMBJP will be implemented under PSP schemes to the extent possible. \n \n8.  Successful implementation of PSP schemes requires the establishment of a policy and \ninstitutional framework conducive to PSP. In 1997, MORTH issued guidelines for PSP in road \ninfrastructure and took a series of policy actions, including (i) according tax exemption status to \nbuilt-operate-transfer investors; (ii) indicating government commitment in preparatory activities, \nincluding land acquisition and removal of utilities; (iii) enabling the Government to provide grants \nof up to 40% of the project cost; (iv) allowing foreign direct investments up to 100% equity \nparticipation; (v) allowing duty free import of modern high performance construction equipment; \nand (vi) amending the National Highway Act to authorize private sector investors to operate a \npart  of  the  NH  system  and  collect  tolls  under  Government  regulation.  Also,  NHAI  was \nempowered to form joint ventures with private sector investors, form special purpose vehicles, \ninvest and lend the funds for such ventures, and raise funds through issuing debentures in the \ncapital markets. In December 2000, the cabinet decided that all four-lane highways under \nresponsibility of NHAI would be tolled, and that NHAI would retain the toll revenues for operation \nand maintenance purposes and for payment of debt services. \n \n9.  While NHAI has employed PSP schemes for highway development in a number of \nprojects under NHDP, the additional works of the PMBJP require additional resources. ADB is \nproviding an advisory TA, to be completed in November 2004, for developing an overall PMBJP \nimplementation arrangement including prioritization, scheduling, and institutional arrangements; \ndeveloping  PSP  schemes  and  their  financing  mechanisms;  and  initial  screening  of \nenvironmental and social impacts of the program.3 The findings of the ongoing toll system study \ncarried out under the ADB-financed Surat-Manor Project will be taken into account in deciding \nsuitability of individual subprojects for public private partnership (PPP).4 \n \n10.  Some of the roads under the PMBJP may not have acceptable financial returns to the \nprivate sector without substantially enhanced conditions and tolls may not be sufficient for full \ncost recovery. The Government, therefore, indicated its willingness to provide a lump-sum grant \n                                                 \n3  ADB.  2003.

The constraints of the current \nPSP guidelines will be examined under the advisory TA and recommendations will be provided \nto induce more PSP to achieve the development goal of PMBJP.  \n \n11.  Since 2000, ADB has provided NHAI with four loans to support the implementation of the \nNHDP, and is currently preparing a new loan that will be the final assistance for the NHDP. The \noverall lesson to be learned from involvement in the sector is that adequate project preparation \nin advance of loan processing is critical to facilitate the delivery of projects in ensuring project \nquality and compliance with ADB's safeguard policies in a timely manner. Although NHAI has \nbuilt its project development capacity, particularly in engineering aspects, proper and timely \nproject appraisal by ADB is necessary to ensure the feasibility and viability of the projects and \ncompliance with ADB\u2019s safeguard policies. Given the magnitude of the program, this cannot be \naccommodated on project-by-project basis. This TA will assist NHAI in advance preparation of a \nseries of projects possible for ADB financing.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n12.  Efficient  transport  is  a  key  to  economic  development  leading  to  poverty  reduction. \nInvestment  in  essential  highway  network  is  part  of  ADB's  continuing  program  to  support \ndevelopment of an integrated and balanced highway network in India. The TA will help the \nGovernment implement the PMBJP by preparing a series of projects under the PMBJP that aim \nto promote domestic and international trade by improving strategic highway network. The output \nwill consist of the preparation of at least two investment packages to be financed by ADB that \nare  economically  and  financially  viable,  and  socially  and  environmentally  responsible,  in \naccordance with the ADB-related policies, guidelines, procedures, and handbooks. The hybrid \nframework for Loan and TA is provided in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The advisory TA, to be completed in November 2004, will recommend, among other \nthings, the scope and the implementation schedule of ADB assistance. The PMBJP project \ndevelopment plan and its linkage to ADB's TAs is indicated in a supplementary appendix. Based \non the findings of the advisory TA, in consultation with ADB and NHAI, the TA consultant will \npropose at least two investment packages, each covering about 1,000 km, to be processed and \nimplemented separately, most likely under the ADB\u2019s sector loan modality.  \n \n14.  NHAI, through its consultants, is currently preparing preliminary studies and design of all \nPMBJP subproject. A technical review team within NHAI will ensure the quality of consultant \nworks in accordance with the guidelines for project preparatory and appraisal prepared under \nADB previous assistance.5 The TA will therefore (i) select roads to be included in the ensuing \nADB-funded projects; (ii) review the technical, economical, and financial viability; and (iii) ensure \ncompliance with environmental and social safeguard policy. \n \n15.  Screening Study. NHAI will propose a long list of possible candidate roads to be \nfinanced  by  ADB,  each  package  with  about  1,500  km  of  roads.  The  TA  will  review  the \npreliminary studies relating to these roads prepared by NHAI. The subprojects will be selected \ntaking into consideration the role in promoting economic development and reducing poverty. For \n                                                 \n5 ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to India for Preparing the National Highway Sector Project. Manila. ", "4  \nthe state capital connectivity, the poorer states will be given priority. The TA will review existing \nsurveys  and  data  relating  to  these  roads,  taking  into  account  traffic  volume,  pavement \nconditions, social and environmental considerations, and the costs and benefits of the road \nupgrading. The output of the screening will be a list of roads that need to be further reviewed, \nconsisting of about 1,000 km per package. The list will be considered by ADB, NHAI, and the \nconsultants at tripartite meetings held during the inception stage and the mid-term stage of the \nTA. The final list will become the basis for the subsequent studies. \n \n16.  Engineering Study. The TA will review engineering aspects of the preliminary study \nand design prepared by NHAI\u2019s consultants. The consultant will ensure that the studies are \nbased on uniform design methodologies and design standards with allowable variations on \naccount  of  specific  site  conditions.  Sites  will  be  visited  as  necessary.  The  aspects  to  be \nreviewed  will  include  topographic  surveys,  design  standards,  traffic  studies,  proposed \nimprovements and alignment, soil and material investigations, pavement options, toll plaza and \nwayside amenities, drainage and bridge structures, road safety measures, and cost estimates.  \n \n17.  Economic and Financial Analyses. Assistance will be provided to supplement NHAI \nefforts in ensuring that the economic and financial analyses are carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. The TA will review and improve as \nnecessary (i) NHAI\u2019s economic and financial analyses of the candidate roads; and (ii) the traffic \nforecast, cost estimates, and benefits. Additional surveys will be carried out as necessary. The \nrevised calculation of the economic and financial internal rates of return then will be prepared. \nSensitivity analyses will be carried out in accordance with the project\u2019s risk assessment.  The \nTA will also analyze the poverty reduction impact of subproject roads in accordance with the \nADB\u2019s  Handbook  for  Integrating  Poverty  Impact  Assessment  in  the  Economic  Analysis  of \nProjects. The consultant will conduct additional surveys as necessary, prepare the benefits \ndistribution analysis, and estimate the poverty impact ratio of the subprojects. \n \n18.  Public  Private  Partnership  Scheme  Development.  The  TA  will  design  a  PPP \ninvestment package, including financial evaluation in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the \nFinancial Governance and Management of Investment Projects. Financial models and PPP \noptions will be developed taking into account the current PPP policy, preference to transfer the \ncommercial  and  revenue  risks  to  the  private  sector  as  much  as  possible,  and  best  PPP \npractices in India and international projects. Financial and sensitivity analyses will be carried \nout, investment packages will be designed, and a framework of concession arrangements \ncovering construction and operation and maintenance will be developed. The consultant will \nalso  develop  tender  documents  including  concession  agreements  and  selection  criteria  of \nbidders, and may assist in the process of evaluating proposals and selecting successful bidders. \n \n19.  Environmental  Impact  Study.  The  TA  will  assist  NHAI  in  complying  with  ADB's \nenvironmental safeguard policies, by ensuring that environmental assessments are prepared in \naccordance  with  the  Government's  environmental  requirements  and  ADB's  Environmental \nAssessment Guidelines (2003). The consultant will review, verify, and recommend any revision \nto  the  environmental  impact  screening  prepared  by  NHAI\u2019s  consultants,  and  guide  the \npreparation  of  the  environmental  impact  assessment  to  ensure  that  all  key  elements  are \nadequately covered in accordance with the applicable requirements. Additional surveys will be \nconducted as necessary. The consultant will then prepare initial environmental examination \n(and/or environmental impact assessment as required) and its summary. As necessary, the \nconsultant will also undertake strategic environmental assessment to address environmental \nissues  and  the  sector\u2019s  development  needs  and  to  identify  potentially  beneficial  policy \ninterventions that can be included in the ensuing projects. ", "  5\n20.  Social Impact Study. The TA will assist NHAI in complying with ADB's social safeguard \npolicies, by ensuring that social analyses are carried out in accordance with ADB's Guidelines \nfor the Incorporation of Social Dimensions in ADB Operations. The summary initial poverty and \nsocial analysis is in Appendix 2. The consultant will review, verify, and revise (as necessary) the \nsocial  impact  assessments,  resettlement  plans  and  indigenous  people  development  plans, \nprepared  by  NHAI,  to  ensure  the  compliance  with  relevant  ADB  policies,  guidelines,  and \nhandbooks. Additional surveys will be conducted as necessary. The social assessment will \ninclude poverty assessment, gender issues, women and children labor issues, and others. The \nconsultant then will prepare summary resettlement plans, and indigenous peoples development \nplans as necessary. A resettlement and indigenous peoples development framework will also be \ndeveloped  as  required  by  ADB  for  preparing  sector  loans,  and  as  guidance  for  NHAI  in \npreparing subsequent subprojects. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n21.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1.25 million equivalent, consisting of $784,000 \nin foreign exchange and $466,000 equivalent in local currency costs (Appendix 3). ADB will \nfinance  $1.00  million  equivalent  on  a  grant  basis  from  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program.  The \nGovernment  will  finance  $250,000  equivalent  by  providing  office  accommodation,  support \nfacilities, counterpart staff, local transportation, maps, reports, and other logistical support. The \nGovernment has been informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any \nensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n22.  NHAI will be the Executing Agency through its PMBJP unit headed by a chief general \nmanager,  who  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day  implementation  of  the  TA,  including \ncoordinating  with  concerned  line  ministries,  agencies,  and  external  funding  agencies.  The \nGovernment has assured the Mission that all required counterpart staff, office space, furniture, \nequipment, support facilities for surveys, maps, reports, and other support services will be made \navailable to the consultants in a timely manner. \n \n23.  The TA will be implemented in two packages; each covers one investment package. It \nwill commence in January 2005 and be completed in June 2006. All consultants will be engaged \nby  ADB  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic  consultants.  An  international \nconsulting firm associated with local consulting firms will be recruited for package 1, using the \nquality-  and  cost-based  selection  method.  Subject  to  satisfactory  performance  the  same \nconsultant  team  may  be  directly  engaged  for  package  2;  otherwise  the  same  consultant \nselection procedures of package 1 will be repeated. Each package will require expertise of a \ntransport  economist,  highway  engineer,  PPP  adviser,  environmental  specialist,  social \ndevelopment specialist, and resettlement specialist. Individual consultants may also be recruited \nas necessary. The TA will require about 28 person-months of international and 20 person-\nmonths of domestic inputs. Outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 4. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n24.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of India for preparing the High Priority National Highways Project, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board.
