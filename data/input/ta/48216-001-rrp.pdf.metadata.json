THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on the proposed \nadministration of a grant to be provided by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) to \nMongolia for the Integrated Livelihoods Improvement and Sustainable Tourism in Khuvsgul \nLake National Park Project.1 \n \n2.  Khuvsgul Lake National Park (KLNP) in Khuvsgul aimag (province) supports a rapidly \nexpanding but uncontrolled tourism industry and a small local population that is poor, receives \nfew benefits from tourism, and is dependent on subsistence use of natural resources. The grant \nwill support local livelihoods through improved capacity for sustainable tourism and subsistence \nactivities, in participation with the park administration and other key stakeholders. The project \ndesign adopts an integrated approach for livelihoods, tourism, waste management, and land \nuse planning, and will serve as a model for other protected areas in Mongolia. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The KLNP was established in 1992. It encompasses 1.2 million hectares of forests and \nmountains that surround Khuvsgul Lake, which is one of the world\u2019s most important reservoirs of \nfreshwater. The lake has a volume of 380.7 cubic kilometers, and is the largest freshwater lake \nin Mongolia. It contains 70% of Mongolia\u2019s freshwater and 1% of global freshwater.2 The water \nquality is high, and there are no dams. Khuvsgul Lake is also of transboundary importance as it \ndrains via the country\u2019s largest river, the Selenge, into Baikal Lake in the Russian Federation. \nMost of the park\u2019s population is located in two settlements, Khatgal (at the southern end of the \nlake) and Khankh (at the northern end). Khatgal is the main entry point to the park. Khankh and \nthe park\u2019s northern area can be accessed only via an unsealed road from Khatgal, or from the \nRussian Federation. The park borders the Russian Federation and a highway extends from the \nnearest Russian City, Irkutsk, to Khankh. \n \n4.  Khuvsgul aimag is the second-poorest of Mongolia\u2019s 21 aimags. In 2014, (i) gross \ndomestic product per capita was $2,008, versus a national mean of $3,920; (ii) the mean annual \nsalary was $2,940 per employee, versus a national mean of $5,363; and (iii) unemployment was \n15.1%, versus a national rate of 7.9%.3 The KLNP is located within five soums (districts), four of \nwhich have the highest poverty rates in Mongolia. In 2014, the total population of the five soums \nwas 16,000 people, including 3,093 (943 households) in Khatgal and 2,648 (819 households) in \nKhankh. Human population densities in the park are low. Poverty-stricken households account \nfor 43.4% (410) of households in Khatgal, and 81.5% (668) of those in Khankh,4 while herding \nhouseholds make up 30.2% (285) of households in Khatgal, and 44.5% (365) of those in \nKhankh (footnote 3). \n \n5.  The KLNP is becoming one of the most popular tourism destinations in Mongolia. Tourist \nnumbers and facilities are expanding rapidly: between 2010 and 2014, annual tourist visits to \nthe KLNP rose from 11,000 to 60,000 as a result of improved road access and reduced visa \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  C. Goulden et al. 2006. The Geology, Biodiversity and Ecology of Lake H\u00f6vsg\u00f6l (Mongolia). Leiden: Backhuys \nPublishers. \n3  National Statistical Office of Mongolia. 2014. Mongolian Statistical Yearbook 2014. Ulaanbaatar. \n4  Defined by the 2013 National Poverty Guidelines based on a range of socioeconomic variables. \n ", "2 \nrestrictions.5 No  growth  projections  are  available,  but  Khuvsgul  aimag  and  the  KLNP  are \ntargeted as a key region for the development of tourism and associated infrastructure.6 This \nexpansion is occurring in the absence of planning. There is no framework for coordination \namong  the  key  KLNP  stakeholders\u2014the  KLNP  Administration,  communities,  and  tour \noperators\u2014nor a shared vision, targets, or codes of conduct for tourism. Vehicle access and \ncamping are uncontrolled and some camps are unlicensed. Enforcement of park regulations by \nthe KLNP Administration is an important but only partial solution to these issues, which requires \nthe active support of other stakeholders.7 Tourism presents a major opportunity to support local \nlivelihoods,  yet  few  residents  are  benefiting  because  of  limited  capacity  and  resources  to \ndevelop tourism goods and services. Constraints include a lack of technical and marketing skills \nand  capital  to  produce  quality  goods  (e.g.,  handicrafts)  and  provide  reliable  supplies  and \nservices (e.g., food supplies and guiding). \n \n6.  Grazing of livestock in the area of the park has occurred for centuries and provides meat, \nwool, and dairy products for residents. Livestock grazing will continue to be a principal livelihood \nfor many residents in the KLNP and buffer zone, especially those that graze their livestock in \nremote areas far from tourism-related opportunities.8 These benefits are declining because of \novergrazing, caused by increasing human and livestock populations, and limited grazing lands. \nIn 2014, there were about 62,160 livestock in the KLNP, including 21,502 (35%) goats and \n15,161 (24%) sheep.9 There is no organized management of herding in the area, and herding \nfamilies have limited capacity and resources to improve the sustainability of their practices and \ndiversify their income. Overgrazing is also contributing to soil exposure, permafrost melt, tree \ndieback, and conversion of forest to steppe, in a continuous cycle that also increases fire risk. \n \n7.  Khuvsgul Lake\u2019s largely pristine state is the foundation for livelihoods and tourism, but \nuncontrolled sewage and litter from tourism threaten lake water quality.10 There is no organized \nwaste management system in the KLNP. Toilet facilities are mostly unlined pits, and sewage \nseeps into soil and the lake. Resources for litter collection are inadequate and the lake already \ncontains  plastic  litter. 11  Traditional  solutions  involving  large-scale  waste  management \ninfrastructure  are  not  appropriate  for  the  KLNP,  because  of  the  fragile  and  very  cold \nenvironment, limited value of flushing systems (water is frozen from November to June), and \nlocation in a protected area. Waste management at the KLNP requires innovative and small-\nscale methods that are simple and cost-effective, involve communities, can be replicated locally, \nand minimize or avoid the use of water. Baseline data on pollution sources are required to guide \nwaste management, but no waste assessment or extended monitoring have been conducted. \n \n8.  The internal zoning of a protected area is a critical policy tool to support livelihoods.12 At \nthe KLNP, the current zones exhibit inconsistencies with land use. Given the rapid increase of \ntourism and likely expansion of associated infrastructure, a best-practice approach to strengthen \nthe park zoning would provide a strong basis to support communities, tourism, and conservation. \nImproved zoning could (i) support the residents of Khankh, an isolated enclave in the KLNP; (ii) \n                                                \n5  KLNP Visitor Logbook. \n6  Tsedendamba. 2012.

Ulaanbaatar: MED, MDI, ADB. \n7  Support to the KLNP Administration for ranger training is being given by the Mongol Ecology Center. \n8  Mongolia\u2019s Law on Buffer Zones broadly defines a buffer zone as the entirety of all soum lands surrounding a \nprotected area. The current project will focus on communities within and immediately adjacent to the KLNP. \n9  KLNP Administration unpublished data 15 June 2015. \n10 Khuvsgul Lake is ultra-oligotrophic (very low nutrient levels): sewage presents a high risk for eutrophication. \n11 C. Free et al. 2014. High-levels of microplastic pollution in a large, remote, mountain lake. Marine Pollution Bulletin \n85: 156\u2013163. \n12 Mongolia\u2019s Law on Special Protected Areas prescribes three zones: strict protection, and limited- and multiple-use. \n ", "3 \nsupport herding livelihoods; (iii) identify strategic areas for tourism and future investment; (iv) \nhelp  secure  the  water  quality  of  the  lake;  and  (v)  improve  the  sustainability  of  actions \nundertaken by the current project through long-term planning. \n \n9.  Government and donor initiatives are addressing some of these issues. The park\u2019s first \nmanagement plan was approved in 2014 and mentions tourism and waste management, but \nprovides no targets or actions. Between 2013 and 2014, a river basin authority and buffer zone \ncouncils  were  established,  yet  these  have  limited  training  and  funds.  A  small  community \nmarketplace for tourist products was constructed in 2015 in Khatgal. Research on natural \nresources has been conducted in the KLNP since the 1950s. Civil society organizations (CSOs) \nhave provided support for park management, ranger training, sanitation, and green education \nprograms. The need to support community-based tourism and waste management in the KLNP \nis widely acknowledged by the government, communities, and tour operators. \n \n10.  At the national level, an integrated approach that balances livelihoods, tourism, waste \nmanagement,  and  biodiversity  conservation  within  protected  areas  is  urgently  needed. \nGovernment efforts to expand tourism are centered on Mongolia\u2019s unique wilderness values and \nlarge network of protected areas, which cover 18% of the country.13 These are generally located \nin poor regions with limited infrastructure, which presents challenges for maintaining ecological \nvalues, providing benefits to communities, and ensuring sustainable tourism. Few such models \nare available, although previous projects have confirmed the benefits of tourism for communities \nin protected areas.14 For improving the livelihoods of herding families, previous JFPR projects in \nMongolia present strong models for the current project,15 provided they are tailored to local \nconditions.16 \n \n11.  The project will be among the first in Mongolia to address the linked issues of livelihoods, \ntourism, and waste management in a protected area. New participatory mechanisms for the \nKLNP will be piloted, including co-management approaches for tourism and waste management, \nand community-led revolving funds for livelihood improvement.17 Measures have been designed \nto promote community ownership and entrepreneurship. For waste management, toilet systems \nthat are suitable for the cold and fragile environment of the KLNP will be piloted. The project is \nstrongly oriented toward stakeholder participation. Two CSOs active in the park will be members \nof the project steering committee, and the project will coordinate with another protected area \nprogram.18 The potential use of donor skills and resources under the project includes (i) an \necotourism  training  program,  (ii)  collaboration  with  Japan  tourism  associations,  and  (iii) \n                                                \n13  United  Nations  Development  Programme.

By integrating poverty reduction, income generation, and the sustainable use of natural \nresources, the project will directly contribute to Mongolia\u2019s Action Program, 2012\u20132016,21 Green \nDevelopment Policy 2014,22 and Khuvsgul aimag Socio-Economic Development Action Plan, \n2008\u20132015.23 The project supports the interim country partnership strategy, 2014\u20132016 for \nMongolia,24 and Environment Operational Directions, 2013\u20132020 of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB),25 for inclusive and sustainable growth; and the government of Japan\u2019s Country \nAssistance  Policy  and  Midterm  Strategic  Action  Plan  for  Mongolia, 26  through  income \ndiversification  for  herders  and  the  protection  of  water  resources.  The  project  provides  an \nopportunity to facilitate future ADB assistance to Khuvsgul aimag, especially for the sustainable \ndevelopment  of  regional  tourism.  ADB  is  well  placed  to  support  the  project  through  its \ninstitutional experience and work with multiple stakeholders in Mongolia. \n \nB.  Impacts and Outcome \n \n13.  The impacts will be (i) per capita income in five soums of Khuvsgul aimag increased, \nand  (ii)  management  of  natural  resources  in  the  KLNP  improved.  The  outcome  will  be \nlivelihoods and sustainable tourism in five soums of the KLNP improved and integrated. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n14.  The project will have three outputs: (i) community-based tourism in Khatgal and Khankh \nsettlements promoted, (ii) capacity for sustainable livestock and pasture management in the \nKLNP  and  buffer  zone  improved,  and  (iii)  waste  management  around  Khuvsgul  Lake \nstrengthened. \n \n15.  Output 1: Community-based tourism in Khatgal and Khankh settlements promoted. \nOutput 1 will (i) establish the first pilot comanagement tourism group for the KLNP, comprising \nthe KLNP Administration, communities, tour operators, and soum governments; (ii) develop a \nstakeholder vision, targets, and codes of practice for tourism; and (iii) promote and strengthen \ncommunity-based tourism, including household-scale enterprises such as guiding, handicrafts, \nand the provision of food supplies to guest houses. \n \n16.  Output  2:  Capacity  for  sustainable  livestock  and  pasture  management  in  the \nKhuvsgul Lake National Park and buffer zone improved.  Output 2 will (i) establish herder \ngroups  among  the  herding  families  in  the  KLNP  and  buffer  zone;  (ii)  establish  herder \nmanagement plans for each herder group that are tailored to local conditions, including optimal \nstocking densities and pasture management; and (iii) support income diversification for herder \nfamilies, especially those with limited opportunities for tourism-based income. Output 2 will use \n                                                \n19 From 2016 to 2017, there will be four JICA volunteers stationed in Khuvsgul aimag. \n20 ADB. 2014.

Outputs 1 and 2 will be supported through a combination of specialist support, training, \nand the establishment of five community revolving funds (one per project soum). The funds will \nbe  community-managed  and  support  household-scale  enterprises,  with  17%  of  the  grant \nproceeds (an average of $100,000 or 4% per soum) channeled into the funds.27 Funds will be \nheld in one bank account per soum. The project will provide financing expertise, training, and \ninitial  capital  for  the first  4  years for  the communities  to  develop  and  manage the funds, \nincluding the establishment of fund committees, operating procedures, and repayment terms \nand conditions. Loans will be limited to activities compatible with outputs 1 and 2, the KLNP \nManagement Plan, and domestic and ADB policies and regulations. The interest rate applied to \nloans will be low and reviewed regularly.28 Interest repayments over the 4-year project duration \nwill replenish the funds. The activity is aligned with Mongolia\u2019s Law on Buffer Zones, which \nprovides a legal framework to support communities in protected areas and buffer zones. \n \n18.  Output 3: Waste management around Khuvsgul Lake strengthened. Output 3 will (i) \nimplement a water quality monitoring program tailored to the project activities, including a rapid \nassessment of threats to the water quality of Khuvsgul Lake; (ii) establish a pilot community-led \nwaste  management  program,  including  waste  management  teams,  the  installation  of  low \nenvironmental impact toilet facilities and litter bins, and the phasing in of public campsite fees to \nfund team salaries and facility operation and maintenance (O&M); and (iii) conduct a best-\npractice review on the internal zoning of the KLNP, including scientific and traditional knowledge \nand stakeholder consultation, to identify zones that maximize benefits to livelihoods, tourism, \nand conservation. \n \n19.  Project management. The executing and implementing agencies lack the personnel \nand resources needed to fully implement the project. The grant proceeds will also (i) establish \nthe  administrative  framework  for  the  project,  including  a  steering  committee,  project \nmanagement unit (PMU), and project implementation unit (PIU); and (ii) finance the specialist \nsupport and PMU and PIU operational costs required to implement outputs 1\u20133. The PMU and \nPIU will implement the project on behalf of the executing and implementing agencies, including \naccounting,  procurement,  training,  preparation  and  dissemination  of  knowledge  products, \nmonitoring, and reporting. \n \n20.  Sustainability,  replication,  and  expansion.  The  activities  under  outputs  1\u20133  will \nsupport the project\u2019s sustainability after project completion. Design measures for sustainability \ninclude the revolving fund approach, long-term land use planning through the herding groups \nand review of park internal zoning, use of campsite fees to support team salaries and O&M of \nfacilities,  simple  and  replicable  designs  for  facilities,  and  the  participatory  approach  to  be \nadopted for all activities. Opportunities to promote the integrated project approach for livelihoods \nand sustainable tourism, and to develop new initiatives in Khuvsgul aimag and/or elsewhere in \nMongolia, will be identified through (i) the review of KLNP internal zoning, which will include \nmultistakeholder discussions on land-use planning and sustainable development of regional \ntourism; (ii) the development of new partnerships during the project, including between the \nKhuvsgul aimag government, the Ministry of Environment, Green Development and Tourism \n(MEGDT), and ADB; and (iii) the preparation of a scale-up strategy and investment plan. This \n                                                \n27 A range of grant disbursement mechanisms were assessed, including the use of bank loans and/or credit unions. \n28 The rate will be slightly lower than the government's policy lending rate. \n ", "6 \nwill describe post project financing for O&M of the project facilities, replication of the project \ngoods and services, and specific follow-up opportunities. \n \n21.  Stakeholder communication and dissemination of project results. Khuvsgul Lake is \nrevered in Mongolia and is a high-profile area subject to frequent media coverage. A project \nstakeholder communication strategy has been prepared and is in the project administration \nmanual (PAM).29 The strategy describes target audiences and media approaches, including \npublic events and workshops. These activities will also serve to promote the project approach \nand distribute relevant lessons. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n22.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n25.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in the PAM \n(footnote 29). \n \n26.  The project will be implemented over a period of 4 years, tentatively from 1 January \n2016 to 31 December 2019.30 The MEGDT, acting through the Department of Protected Areas \nManagement, will be the executing agency responsible for overall project implementation. The \nKLNP  Administration,  under  the  Department  of  Protected  Areas  Management,  will  be  the \nimplementing agency. The executing and implementing agencies will be supported by a team of \nfull-time and temporary consultants that will staff the PMU (based in the offices of the executing \nagency  in  Ulaanbaatar)  and  PIU  (based  at  the  KLNP  headquarters  in  Khatgal).  All  ADB-\nfinanced procurement for the project will be conducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). An accountant and a procurement specialist \nwill be recruited under the PMU to provide administrative support in project operation, and \nprocure project goods and works. \n \n27.  The steering committee will provide oversight and policy guidance for the project and \nmeet at least semiannually. The committee will be chaired by the executing agency and include \nrepresentatives from the Khuvsgul aimag and soum governments, project communities, and \nCSOs. ADB and the Embassy of Japan in Mongolia will be invited to participate as observers. \nThe five project soum governments will each assign a counterpart officer to the project. \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  January 2016\u2013December 2019 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2019 and 30 June 2020 \nand grant closing date \nManagement   \n(i)  Oversight body  Project steering committee \n(ii)  Executing agency  Ministry  of  Environment,  Green  Development  and  Tourism,  acting  through  the \nDepartment of Protected Areas Management  \n(iii) Implementing agency  Khuvsgul  Lake  National  Park  Administration  of  the  Department  of  Protected  Areas \nManagement \nProcurement  Shopping for goods  7 contracts  $290,000 \nCommunity participation  3 contracts  $70,000 \nConsulting services  Individual consultant selection  490 person-months  $862,016 \nConsultants\u2019 qualifications selection  2 contracts  $202,000 \nLeast-cost selection  1 contract  $40,000 \nAdvance contracting  The government requested advance contracting for consulting services.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n28.  The project technical design was prepared by the government, project consultants, and \nADB project team, based on site visits, stakeholder consultations, and desktop review. The \n                                                \n30 The project is included in ADB\u2019s 2015 grant pipeline as firm. \n ", "8 \nproject consulting services will provide the necessary technical support to ensure that best \npractices are integrated into the detailed designs and implementation. Climate risk to the project \nwas initially assessed as \u201cmedium\u201d but was downgraded to \u201clow\u201d with clarification of the limited \nscale of project works. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n29.  The proposed community revolving funds will have a substantial financial impact on \ncommunity livelihoods through multiplier effects. The economic viability of the project and six \ncommunity business models was assessed based on the economic cost of capital of 12% \nthrough testing of \"with\" and \"without\" project scenarios. The analysis confirmed that the models \nare economically viable, with economic internal rates of return of 16.3% for the project and \n13.9% to 18.0% for the models. The other substantial economic benefits of the project comprise \nthe long-term protection of ecosystem services at the KLNP due to improved environmental \nmanagement, especially pollution and pasture management and the protection of lake water \nquality for local and downstream residents. These services were not quantified, but will support \nthe natural resources upon which livelihoods are based, as well as economic opportunities from \ntourism and income diversification from traditional herding activities. Given the high poverty \nincidence in the project area, the project is expected to have substantial poverty impact. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n30.  Financial  management  and  procurement  risk  assessments  were  conducted  for  the \nexecuting  and  implementing  agencies.  The  premitigation  financial  risks  for  the  project  are \n\u201cmedium\u201d and the procurement management risks \u201chigh.\u201d The executing agency lacks in-house \nqualified financial and procurement personnel but is supported by the MEGDT\u2019s Economic, \nFinancial  and  Planning  Division,  which  provides  financial  and  auditing  oversight  and  is \nexperienced in the implementation of donor-funded projects. A financial management action \nplan has been prepared and includes the following risk mitigation measures: (i) a qualified \naccountant  and  a  procurement  specialist  will  be  recruited  under  the  PMU;  (ii)  accountant \nsoftware  acceptable  to  ADB  will  be  used,  supported  by  hard  copy  records;  and  (iii)  the \nEconomic, Financial and Planning Division will provide financial and auditing support to the \nexecuting and implementing agencies. The Ministry of Finance and the MEGDT will establish a \nprocurement committee for the project to review and approve the work of the PMU procurement \nspecialist,  and  ADB  will  provide  training  and  intermittent  mentorship  on  procurement  and \nconsultant recruitment. \n \n31.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) and Public Communications \nPolicy 2011 were explained to and discussed with the executing and implementing agencies, \nwhich are aware of ADB\u2019s disclosure requirements for project reports and auditing. The specific \npolicy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 29). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n32.  The project is designed for livelihood improvement and income diversification and is \nclassified effective gender mainstreaming under ADB\u2019s project gender classification system. \nOutputs 1 and 2 will establish or strengthen at least 110 household enterprises in tourism and/or \nsustainable use of natural resources in up to five soums of the KLNP, which will benefit at least \n330 households (over 900 residents). Output 3 will generate at least 45 new jobs through the \nestablishment of the community waste management teams. Around 1,500 residents (10% of the \npopulation of the five soums) will receive capacity development and specialist support in income \n ", "9 \ngeneration,  ecotourism  development,  rural  financing,  livestock  management,  agricultural \nprocessing,  and/or  waste  management.  A  gender  action  plan  was  prepared  and  includes \nminimum targets of 30%\u201340% involvement of women in the community-based enterprises and \ntraining. Many guest houses and other household enterprises (e.g., handicrafts) in the project \narea are led by women and these will be further promoted through the gender action plan. \nProject activities are designed to be participatory and inclusive, and will support the involvement \nof poor households, especially in Khankh settlement, which has high poverty rates. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n33.  Environment  (category  C).  An  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework \n(EARF)31 has been prepared and complies with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).32 \nThe  EARF  includes  an  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  and  describes  the \nenvironmental safeguard screening, management and reporting procedures to be applied to all \nactivities supported by the project.33 The implementing agency, supported by the PIU, will be \nresponsible for EMP implementation. The screening procedures will exclude any category A or \nB activities. No significant adverse environmental impacts are expected. The project contributes \nenvironmental benefits by supporting improved tourism and waste management, lake protection, \nand improved livestock and pasture management practices. All activities will be compatible with \nthe KLNP Management Plan and Mongolia\u2019s Law on Special Protected Areas and Law on \nBuffer Zones. \n \n34.  Involuntary resettlement (category C) and indigenous peoples (category C). The \nproject does not involve involuntary resettlement or land acquisition. Khuvsgul aimag supports \nMongolia\u2019s only population of the Dukha (\u201creindeer people\u201d), a vulnerable ethnic group. Their \nsettlements are located over 50 kilometers west of the KLNP. A few families occasionally visit \nKhuvsgul Lake to sell locally made or imported handicrafts (souvenirs) to tourists. They camp on \naccess roads and do not stay long, partly because of the grazing feed requirements of their \nreindeer, which cannot be met in the lake area. The Dukha have no seasonal settlements \n(permanent or regular) or traditional migration routes in the KLNP, and do not practice livestock \nherding.  The  project  will  not  result  in  impacts  to  the  Dukha.  Nonetheless,  the  design  of \necotourism activities will include culturally sensitive approaches. \n \n35.  Grievance redress mechanism. The grievance redress mechanism (GRM) comprises \nsteps with time-based actions to ensure that any public concerns are quickly identified and \naddressed. The PIU and implementing agency will implement the GRM. The GRM is described \nin the PAM and EARF. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n36.  The project has potential governance, financial, and procurement risks. The project \nprovides adequate measures to mitigate these risks, and the integrated benefits and impacts \nare expected to outweigh the costs. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in \nTable 4 and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.34 \n                                                \n31 Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n32 Disclosed on the ADB website in accordance with the disclosure requirements of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement.
