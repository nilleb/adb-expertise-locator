The technical assistance (TA) will assist the Government of Papua New Guinea (PNG) \nin undertaking a Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). The Government convened the 2005 \nNational Health Conference in Kimbe in June 2005. At the conference, the Department of \nNational Planning and Monitoring (DNPM) stressed the importance of optimally integrating the \nMedium-Term  Development  Strategy  (MTDS)  2005\u20132010,  Millennium  Development  Goals \n(MDGs),  and  National  Population  Policy  (NPP)  2000\u20132010  through  its  presentation  of  the \nMDG/MTDS Monitoring Plan 2005\u20132015. Development partners pointed out that monitoring \nthese strategies and goals could not rely solely on data sources like the civil registration system \nand service statistics of Government departments because of their incompleteness and other \ndeficiencies. Monitoring in PNG therefore has to depend largely on survey data.  \n \n2.  At the conference, the proposal for undertaking a DHS in 2006 was discussed among \nfunding  agencies,  notably  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  Australian  Agency  for \nInternational  Development  (AusAID),  and  the  New  Zealand  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment (NZAID). Donor partners announced their support for conducting the DHS in 2006, \nbut a detailed implementation scheme was not determined at the conference. \n \n3.  The National Statistical Office (NSO) hosted a DHS initiating meeting on 26 August 2005. \nAt that meeting, NSO and DNPM reaffirmed their commitment to the 2006 DHS. During the \nFact-Finding  Mission  on  7\u201311  November  2005,  an  understanding  was  reached  with  the \nGovernment on TA objectives and implementation arrangements, and with AusAID and NZAID \non the cofinancing plan. The TA design and monitoring framework is attached as Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Nearly 80% of PNG's 5.5 million people live in rural areas. Rugged terrain, limited \nphysical infrastructure, remoteness, and fragmented communities make effective provision of \nbasic social services a major challenge for the Government. Concerns regarding population \ngrowth and demographic changes; issues related to gender, urbanization, and demographic \ntransfer; and basic social services delivery led the Government to adopt the MTDS and MDG \nreport1 in 2004.  \n \n5.  The principal goal of the MTDS is to improve the quality of life and accelerate the pace \nof development in the country. DNPM has overall responsibility to coordinate and monitor the \nimplementation of the MTDS. The Government acknowledges that measuring the successful \nimplementation of the MTDS and the achievement of the MDGs will require a clearly set \nbenchmark.  In  view  of  the  major  challenges  to  providing  basic  social  services,  a  socio-\ndemographic and health survey is a high priority for DNPM and development partners in order \nto monitor social and poverty conditions. \n \n6.  Poor transportation and communications infrastructure, as well as cultural barriers, make \nit  difficult  to  increase  awareness  about  diseases  and  their  prevention.  Ample  anecdotal \nevidence shows how poor medical and public health conditions are in PNG.2 However, the \nmagnitude of the problems and differences across provinces are not known. Because economic \ngrowth  interrelates  with  the  provision  of  basic  social  services,  population  growth,  and \n                                                 \n1  PNG. 2004. Millennium Development Goals in Papua New Guinea. Port Moresby.  \n2  For instance, though a sizable proportion of rural health facilities are closed, they are frequently reported open.  \n ", "2   \ndemographic changes, setting a clear benchmark is indispensable for developing evidence-\nbased development strategies.  \n \n7.  Demographic and health issues cannot be separated from gender issues. The health of \nmothers and children is closely related to the status of women. The social aspects of sexually \ntransmitted infections are growing concerns in PNG due to the impact of HIV/AIDS. Gender \ninequality is one of the cultural and socioeconomic causes of poor public health.  \n \n8.  Knowledge  of  demographic  change  and  health  status  is  essential  for  effective \ndevelopment  planning  for  the  county.  The  DHS  was  undertaken  in  1996,  facilitating  the \nformulation of a number of demographic and health-related policies, including the (i) NPP 2000\u2013\n2010, (ii) National Health Plan 2001\u20132010, (iii) National Human Development Report 1999\u2013\n2000, (iv) MTDS, and (v) MDG report. Repeating the DHS is recommended every 5 years.  \n \n9.  The output of TA is of crucial importance for monitoring the MTDS and MDGs and will be \nfully  utilized  to  monitor  various  population  and  health  indicators  employed  to  develop  the \nstrategies  and  policies  mentioned  above.  Monitoring  knowledge  and  attitudes  toward  the \nHIV/AIDS epidemic will be part of the TA result, providing indispensable information for tackling \nthe epidemic.  \n \n10.  Support to undertake the DHS is fully consistent with (i) the Government\u2019s strategies and \npolicies, (ii) ADB\u2019s pacific strategy for 2005\u20132009, and (iii) ADB\u2019s country strategy and program \nupdate 2005\u20132006 for PNG.3 Support provided through TA will complement ADB\u2019s ongoing \ncapacity-building TA for the NSO.4  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  TA will enhance monitoring relevant to MTDS and MDG targets and formulating social \ndevelopment strategies in PNG. It will identify the most efficient and effective modalities to help \nachieve these specific goals. It will generate and disseminate high-quality demographic and \nhealth survey data to use in formulating an evidence-based strategy.  \n \n12.  TA results will include (i) estimates of intercensal population size and growth and basic \ndemographic characteristics; (ii) information on the population\u2019s reproductive health, fertility \npreferences, and family-planning practices; (iii) information about access to and use of health \nservices and facilities; (iv) information on the health status of the population, particularly of \nmothers  and  children;  (v)  information  on  awareness  and  attitudes  toward  HIV/AIDS;  (vi) \ninformation on the prevalence of contraceptive use; and (vii) assistance in demographic and \nhealth-related research and evidence-based policymaking. \n \n13.  TA will facilitate consultation with stakeholders to establish an information-sharing and \ncoordination mechanism for country data collection, analysis, and monitoring activities. It will \nencourage contributions from other development partners to build on, expand, and extend TA \nactivities.  \n \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2004.

As the 1996 DHS provides a significant database for future initiatives in the population, \nhealth, basic social services field, TA will build on its work. Following upon the 1996 DHS, TA \nwill undertake national surveys of households, women, and men. The key activities include (i) \ndeveloping the sampling frames from the household listing from the 2000 census, (ii) preparing \nsurvey instruments, (iii) undertaking the pre-test, (iv) training enumerators and fieldworkers, (v) \nproviding training and supervision for data entry and processing, (vi) conducting publicity and \nincreasing awareness through various media, (vii) assisting NSO staff in reporting requirements \nfor MDGs and other demographic- and health-related indicators, and (viii) helping planners and \nstaff at the National Department of Health to formulate an evidence-based social policy.  \n \n15.  Lessons learned from the 1996 DHS, 2000 census, and past censuses will be fully \nexplored before undertaking the 2006 DHS. AusAID, NZAID, United Nations Population Fund \n(UNFPA), and United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) have been assisting survey activities \nin PNG, and TA will facilitate consultation with appropriate staff of these partner organizations \nfor any comments and advice early in TA implementation. Also through AusAID and NZAID, \nassistance will be sought, if necessary, from the Australian Bureau of Statistics and Statistics \nNew Zealand. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  TA, to be administered by ADB, is estimated to cost $3.232 million equivalent. The \nGovernment has requested financing on a grant basis of $250,000 from the Japan Special Fund, \nfunded by the Government of Japan, $1.320 million from the Government of Australia, and \n$662,000 from the Government of New Zealand, for a total of $2.232 million. The Government \nwill finance the remaining $1 million equivalent through in-kind contributions, including office \naccommodation and facilities, counterpart staff and surveys needed for TA. The cost estimates \nand financing plan are attached in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  DNPM will be the Executing Agency, and NSO the Implementing Agency. The total \nduration of TA will be 18 months beginning in July 2006 and ending in January 2008. TA will \nrequire 40 person-months of international and domestic consulting services in total, including \nthe  (i)  demographic  and  health  survey  specialists  and  team  leader  for  12  person-months \n(domestic, intermittent), (ii) sampling and survey specialist for 1 person-month (international, \nintermittent), (iii) data processing and computer specialist for 4 person-months (international, \nintermittent),  (iv)  demographer  for  5  person-months  (international,  intermittent),  (v)  funds \nmanager and project coordinator for 10 person-months (international, intermittent), and (iv) field \nsupervisors for 8 person-months (domestic). An international consulting firm will be engaged \nusing the quality-based selection method in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants. The simplified technical proposal procedure will apply. The terms of reference for \nthe consultants are in Appendix 3.  \n \n18.  Any procurement under TA will be conducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines  and  the  relevant  laws  in  Papua  New  Guinea.  However,  in  the  event  of  any \ninconsistency between ADB\u2019s requirements and the national laws, ADB\u2019s requirements will \nprevail. Civil works are limited to repair and upgrading of existing facilities and will be carried out \nthrough direct purchase. All equipment will be turned over to the counterpart agencies upon \ncompletion of TA. \n ", "4   \n \n19.  The  TA  implementation  structure  will  follow  the  1996  DHS.  The  2006  DHS  survey \nmanagement chart is attached in Appendix 4. The steering committee and user\u2019s advisory \ncommittee will be regularly convened, and the team leader and other team members, if they are \navailable, will report to them. The Government statistician will nominate the DHS project director, \nand  the  project  director  will  chair  the  steering  committee  as  well  as  the  user\u2019s  advisory \ncommittee. The DHS steering committee comprises members from DNPM and other interested \ndepartments. Partner agencies, including but not limited to AusAID, NZAID, UNFPA, UNICEF, \nand World Bank, will participate in DHS activities through the user\u2019s advisory committee. The TA \nwill provide a team of DHS experts, and these consultants will directly serve NSO under the \nsupervision of the project director. \n \n20.  ADB, AusAID, and NZAID will work closely with the Government in all phases of the TA. \nIf other funding agencies want to join at a later stage, suitable arrangements will be worked out. \nOutputs resulting from analyses of survey data will be made available to ADB and financing \nagencies, and will be placed in the public domain for further investigation and policy formulation.  \n \nE.  Financial Management and Anticorruption \n21.  DNPM  and  NSO  will  maintain  records  and  accounts  in  accordance  with  generally \naccepted accounting principles, consistently applied, and adequate to identify (i) goods and \nservices financed from the TA funds and (ii) expenditures incurred for the Project. The account \nand related financial statements will be audited annually in accordance with approved auditing \nstandards by independent auditors engaged by ADB. NSO will submit to ADB, AusAID, and \nNZAID through DNPM consolidated annual audited reports within 3 months after the end of \neach  calendar  year.  The  auditor\u2019s  assessment  of  the  examination  relating  to  the  imprest \naccount and statement of expenditures should be separately set out in the auditor\u2019s report. In \naddition, ADB may conduct spot audits and random checks on the flow of funds and their use at \nany time during project implementation, and the Government has pledged its cooperation in \nthese efforts. \n \n22.  For sound financial management, the Project includes an international funds manager \nand  project  coordinator  and  domestic  field  supervisors.  The  funds  manager  and  project \ncoordinator will provide six monthly financial statements.  \n \n23.  The Project will be implemented in line with ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION AND DECISION \n24.  The President recommends that the Board approve ADB administering a portion of \ntechnical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,320,000 to the Government of Papua \nNew Guinea for the Demographic and Health Survey in Papua New Guinea, to be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Government of Australia. If the Board approves ADB administering the \ntechnical assistance, the President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, will \napprove (i) ADB administering a portion of the technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent \nof $662,000 to be financed on a grant basis by the Government of New Zealand; and (ii) ADB \nproviding the balance not exceeding the equivalent of $250,000 on a grant basis, for the \nDemographic and Health Survey in Papua New Guinea, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard. \n \n \n ", "Appendix 1  5\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  and Risks  \nMechanisms  \nImpact      Assumptions \nEnhance monitoring of  Progress toward health-  Asian Development Bank  \u2022  Government\u2019s continued \nrelevant Medium-Term  and socioeconomic- (ADB) analysis of PNG  commitment to achieving \nDevelopment Strategy  related MTDS and  economies  goals to be set in MTDS \n(MTDS) and Millennium  targets    and MDGs \nDevelopment Goal    Improvement in MTDS and  \u2022  No major external \n(MDG) targets and  Formulation of  MDG indicators  economic shocks \nformulation of social  evidence-based basic     \ndevelopment strategies  social services policies  \nin Papua New Guinea \n(PNG). \nOutcome      Assumption \nGenerate and  Appropriate  ADB review missions and  \u2022  Commitment of the \ndisseminated high- demographic and  reports from steering  Government and \nquality demographic  health data collected  committee and user\u2019s  development partners to \nand health survey data.  and analyzed  advisory committee  use the survey data to \n      inform policy and \n  Improvements in  Records of national  program developments \ncoverage, reliability,  statistics offices and other   \nand timeliness of  key data producers  Risks \ndemographic and    \u2022  Availability of adequate \nhealth statistics   Feedback from social and  human and financial \n  health policy and planning  resources \nSurvey data used by  offices   \u2022  Support from the \npolicymaking    Government \nConsultation with, and  \u2022  Adherence to milestones \nfeedback from, other   \nagencies   \n \nReview of official \npublications and reports \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
