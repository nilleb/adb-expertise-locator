THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Responsive COVID-19 Vaccines for Recovery \nProject under the Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility.  \n \n2.  The project will provide the Government of Bangladesh with timely financing for procuring \nsafe and effective vaccines against the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) based on an agreed list \nof eligible expenditures. It will utilize the rapid response component (RRC) under the Asia Pacific \nVaccine Access Facility (APVAX).1 Ongoing technical assistance (TA) will help strengthen the \nvaccine delivery system.2 The project is aligned with three operational priorities of the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  Strategy  2030:  (i)  addressing  remaining  poverty  and  reducing \ninequalities, (ii) accelerating progress in gender equality, and (iii) fostering regional cooperation \nand integration.3 It is also aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Bangladesh, 2016\u2013\n2020 in the priority areas of improving human capital and health care, and promoting gender \nequality.4 \n \n3.  Bangladesh has met all APVAX access criteria by (i) demonstrating the adverse impact of \nthe COVID-19 pandemic; (ii) completing a needs assessment, a vaccination allocation and \nprioritization plan, and an incremental medical waste management (MWM) plan acceptable to \nADB; (iii) a governor\u2019s letter confirming the government\u2019s commitment to implement the plan and \nensure compliance with APVAX eligibility criteria for ADB financing;5 and (iv) establishing an \neffective development partner coordination mechanism with a clear role for ADB (para. 19). \n \nTable 1: Compliance with Criteria of Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility \nAccess Criteria  ADB Staff Assessment \n1. Demonstrated  Annual GDP growth declined from 8.2% in FY2019 to 5.2% in FY2020.a Exports contracted by \nadverse impact  17.1%. The unemployment rate surged to a high of 22.4% during April\u2013July 2020.b Employment \nof COVID-19  and income losses fell disproportionately on the poor as they are more likely to be engaged in \nthe informal sector. The pandemic also widened gender inequalities in terms of livelihood, \npersonal safety, health, and mental wellbeing. Overall health service utilization declined year-\non-year across most services, with annual average declines of up to 37%.c \n2. Completed  The government has assessed its vaccine readiness based on the WHO vaccine introduction \nneeds  readiness assessment tool. The NDVP presents robust and comprehensive action plans across \nassessment  10 key focus areas.d The needs assessment highlighted that Bangladesh has a high level of \nreadiness for COVID-19 vaccination. Gaps have been identified in key areas such as monitoring \nand  evaluation  systems,  tracking  of  bio-waste  management,  and  the  development  of \ncommunication materials for remote and marginalized areas. The NDVP provides strategies to \naddress these gaps. \n \n1  The proposed project was prepared under the One ADB approach following the streamlined business processes \noutlined in the APVAX policy paper.

THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n1.  The Pandemic \n \n4.  Background. Since the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in Bangladesh in March \n2020, 776,257 cases have been confirmed and 12,005 people have died from the virus as of 11 \nMay 2021.6 The pandemic has resulted in high costs to the country\u2019s overall health, wellbeing, \nand the economy. Bangladesh is currently experiencing a second wave, which has led to a rapid \nspike in new cases, with the highest number of deaths (112) in a single day on 19 April 2021.7 \nThe  resurgence  in  infections  threatens  to  incur  prolonged  health  and  economic  costs. \nRecognizing the need for vaccinations, the government acted swiftly to roll out vaccinations \nstarting 7 February 2021. The government has secured a pipeline of 33.2 million doses and more \n \n6  Government of Bangladesh, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW), Directorate General of Health Services \n(DGHS). Coronavirus COVID-19 dashboard (accessed 11 May 2021). \n7  Government of Bangladesh, MOHFW, DGHS. Coronavirus COVID-19 dashboard (accessed 18 May 2021). The test \npositivity rate is 13% as of 24 April 2021. This figure is high compared with the 5% benchmark set by the World \nHealth Organization (WHO). \n ", " \n3 \nthan 9.3 million people have been vaccinated as of 9 May 2021.8 The government aims to \ninoculate 80% of its population. However, Bangladesh\u2019s vaccine needs have not been fully met \nand a significant share of the targeted population is yet to be vaccinated. It requires timely \nfinancing support to procure safe and effective vaccines, and avert prolonged risks from the \npandemic.  \n \n2.  Impact of the Pandemic \n \n5.  Costs to the economy. Following years of steady and robust economic growth, the \npandemic led to a decline in the gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate from 8.2% in fiscal \nyear (FY) 2019 to 5.2% in FY2020.9 Because of the global economic slowdown, Bangladesh\u2019s \nexports fell  by  17.1%, widening  the trade  deficit  and  affecting  livelihoods  (footnote  10).  A \ncontraction in garment exports alone (by 18.1%) affected 2.3 million workers.10 Domestic mobility \nrestrictions further reduced consumer demand and disrupted production and supply across the \nagriculture, industry, and service sectors. The unemployment rate surged to a high of 22.4% \nduring April\u2013July 2020, coinciding with a strict lockdown.11 In response to the pandemic, the \ngovernment introduced a countercyclical expenditure plan worth $15.1 billion (4.6% of GDP, the \nhighest in South Asia).12 Financing of the economic stimulus packages, together with declines in \nexport and domestic tax revenues, resulted in increased financing needs of $6.8 billion in FY2020, \nrepresenting  11.4%  of  the  FY2020  budget. 13 Unless  herd  immunity  is  reached  through \nvaccination,  economically  damaging  policy  responses  such  as  the  extension  of  lockdown \nmeasures in place to curb the second wave will further deteriorate economic output and the \ngovernment\u2019s fiscal position. \n \n6.  Impact  on  poor  and  vulnerable  groups.  The  poor  and  vulnerable  groups  face \nmultidimensional adverse impacts of the pandemic, including impacts on income, food security, \nand education. Employment and income losses have fallen disproportionately on the poor as they \nare more likely to be engaged in the informal sector, which was most affected.14 Around 13 million \nto 16 million people may have fallen into poverty in 2020.15 Informal employment for the poor \nmeans that they were largely uninsured from income losses. The pandemic has also heightened \nfood insecurity. Almost 90% of the beneficiaries of a poverty reduction program16 were reportedly \nfood deficient during the government lockdown period\u2014nearly four times more than before the \n \n8  The government has purchased 30 million doses from Serum Institute of India (SII), of which 7 million doses have \nbeen delivered. In addition, it received a donation of 3.2 million doses from the Government of India. Government of \nBangladesh, MOHFW, DGHS. COVID-19 Vaccination dashboard (accessed 11 May 2021). \n9  ADB. 2020.

Impact on gender. Although the disease burden from COVID-19 has been lower among \nwomen,18 the pandemic has affected women disproportionately and widened gender inequalities \nin terms of livelihoods, personal safety, health, and mental wellbeing. Women were more likely to \nbe engaged in the informal sector than men (91.2% versus 82.3%),19 comprised well over half of \nthe garment sector workforce (60%), and were thus more vulnerable to job losses (paras. 5\u20136). \nHealth services data reveal declines in the use of family planning methods (up to 34%) and \nantenatal care services (17%) from 2019 to 2020, adding to risks of an increase in unintended \npregnancies, unsafe abortions, and maternal deaths.20 The lockdown and continuous school \nclosures have put an additional burden on women by increasing the time they spend on childcare \nand household responsibilities. The pandemic has also led to an increase in reported cases of \nviolence against women and girls, adding to their mental health toll.21 Moreover, 94% of nurses \nin the country are women, which further increases their exposure to the virus.22 \n \n8.  Impacts on the health system. The COVID-19 pandemic has accentuated preexisting \nhuman resources and infrastructure constraints in Bangladesh\u2019s health system. More than 8,000 \nhealth workers have been infected (with at least 150 deaths).23 Hospital treatment capacity for \nCOVID-19 has been under increasing pressure, with bed occupancy rates increasing nationally, \nparticularly in Dhaka City.24 The pandemic has adversely affected essential health services \nthrough  both  demand-side  channels  (e.g.,  fear  of  facility-acquired  COVID-19  infection  and \nlockdown-related  mobility  restrictions)  and  supply-side  constraints  (e.g.,  shortage  of  health \nworkers and essential supplies). These declines in service utilization from COVID-19 related \ndisruptions were large initially (e.g., 40% decline in outpatient consultations,25 71% decline in \nroutine immunization, and 29% decline in facility births),26 but recovery has started with key \nmeasures introduced by the government.  \n \n9.  Measures introduced by the government to control the pandemic. Since the first \nCOVID-19 case was confirmed, the government has introduced several measures to control the \npandemic.  Starting  16  March  2020,  the  government  introduced  mandatory  quarantine \nrequirements for international arrivals followed by a shutdown of all educational institutions on \n17 March 2020. In the same month, it announced the closure of nonessential businesses and a \nban on public transport. The national lockdown was lifted at the end of May 2020. However, with \nthe resurgence of infections in April 2021, the government has tightened mobility restrictions and \nschools are to remain closed until mid-May 2021; mask mandates and mandatory negative \n \n17 Government of Bangladesh, Ministry of Finance, Finance Division. 2020.

Government\u2019s Response  \n \n10.  Main issues and gaps identified in the needs assessment. Bangladesh has a robust \nroutine  immunization  program.  The  Expanded  Programme  of  Immunization  (EPI)  has \ndemonstrated  high  capacity  in  introducing  new  vaccines  and  implementing  vaccination \ncampaigns down to the community level.30 The government has leveraged the infrastructure, \nsystems, and expertise of its routine immunization program to roll out COVID-19 vaccinations at \nan impressive pace. Bangladesh is at a high level of readiness to implement the COVID-19 \nvaccination program, as assessed by the World Health Organization (WHO) vaccine introduction \nreadiness assessment tool. However, there remain challenges related to scale, coverage, and \nuptake in rural areas. Key gaps include the lack of (i) robust plans for vaccine waste management, \n(ii) funding to develop materials on vaccine communication and outreach to close gaps in hard-\nto-reach areas through mobile vaccination campaigns, and (iii) integrated digital tools for vaccine \nmonitoring, linking vaccination coverage data with disease incidence data and reporting of \nadverse events following immunization (AEFI), as well as ensuring measures for data protection. \nThe government is addressing these gaps (paras. 16\u201318).31 \n \n11.  National  vaccine  road  map,  prioritization,  and  allocation  plan.32 The  National \nDeployment and Vaccination Plan for COVID-19 Vaccines (NDVP), developed in consultation \nwith the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group, presents the road map for vaccination, \nincluding plans for the deployment and monitoring of COVID-19 vaccines, covering the entire \nvalue chain from importation to inoculation.33 The NDVP is equity-focused and includes plans to \naddress the specific needs of women, the marginalized, and hard-to-reach, as well as the \ndisplaced persons from Myanmar (para. 12).  \n \n12.  The government aims to vaccinate 80% of the population (138.2 million Bangladeshis \nabove the age of 18 years) within 18\u201324 months,34 with a timeline dependent on vaccine \navailability. It plans to secure 306 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines, with two doses allocated \nper person, assuming 10% wastage. The prioritization and allocation plan (Table 2) is organized \n \n27 Government of Bangladesh, MOHFW, DGHS. 2020. National Preparedness and Response Plan for COVID-19, \nBangladesh: Version 5.

Dhaka.  \n \n13.  Vaccine  options.  The  government  has  been  using  the  AstraZeneca  vaccine \nmanufactured by Serum Institute of India (SII) (footnote 8). However, it is exploring a diverse \nportfolio of vaccines and is discussing with other manufacturers and suppliers.35 It is aiming for \nvaccines that are safe, effective, meet Bangladesh\u2019s cold chain capacity, likely to achieve WHO \napproval, and available for delivery in 2021.  \n \n14.  Program financing needs and funding sources. The government has estimated a total \ncost of $3.7 billion, including $614.4 million in operational costs36 to implement the NDVP. It has \nsecured vaccines for at least 8.7% of its population through (i) SII,37 and (ii) a gift of 3.2 million \ndoses from the Government of India. In addition, the government has identified ADB, the World \nBank, and COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) as the key financing partners supporting \nvaccine procurement for 42.6% of the population.38 The remaining 28.7% of the target population \nwill be covered by either the government or other development partners. The government has \nrequested $500 million as cofinancing from the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank for vaccine \nprocurement; discussions on cofinancing arrangements with ADB are ongoing. The World Bank \n \n35 The government aims to secure eligible vaccines (e.g., AstraZeneca/SK Bioscience, Janssen, Sputnik, Novavax, \nSinopharm, Covaxin) through advance market commitments, subject to WHO Emergency Use Listing. \n36 Operational costs are estimated at $2 per dose and are mainly recurrent costs related to vaccine deployment. \n37 The government has purchased 30 million doses from SII through a tripartite agreement between the DGHS, SII, \nand Beximco Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (a procurement agent)\u2014a leading pharmaceutical company in Bangladesh. The \ncost of vaccines under the SII contract may be financed through retroactive financing provided that the ADB \nrequirements relating to anticorruption are met.   \n38 The proposed ADB financing will cover 44.7 million doses for 11.6% of the population at $20 per dose. The World \nBank has provided $412.3 million to cover 42.2 million doses and 11% of the population at $10 per dose. COVAX \nwill provide 76.7 million doses as a grant at an indicative price of $7 per dose for 20% of the population. The \ngovernment has also approached COVAX for an additional 100 million doses on a cost-sharing basis. ADB is \nfinancing $20 per dose as the government is considering vaccines that are likely to cost $20 per dose, given the \nprice volatility (United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) COVID-19 Vaccine Market Dashboard). \n ", " \n7 \nhas provided $87.7 million and the government has allocated $60 million for operational costs. \nThe  government  is  engaging  with  other  development  partners  to  finance  the  remaining \noperational costs for vaccine deployment of $466 million, as well as vaccine procurement, if \nneeded.39 Additionally, a cost of $8.3 million is estimated for vaccinating the displaced persons \nfrom Myanmar to be financed by development agencies.40  \n \n15.   Vaccine  deployment,  monitoring,  and  evaluation.  The  government  has  a  well-\norganized \u201ccascading\u201d planning and coordination mechanism from central to upazila (sub-unit of \ndistrict) levels to oversee the planning and deployment of vaccines.41 The NDVP builds on this \nsystem and provides for a coordination committee and a working group at each administrative \nlevel (national, district and upazila), with clearly defined roles. At the central level, the National \nCOVID-19 Vaccination Task Force, chaired by the health minister, and a working group on \nvaccine management under the additional secretary, Health Services Division, expedite decisions \nrelated to vaccination. The COVID-19 Vaccine Preparedness and Deployment Core Committee \nunder  the  Directorate  General  of  Health  Services  (DGHS)  oversees  coordination  and \nimplementation. Detailed micro-level planning is undertaken at each of the 6,500 vaccination \nsites.42 A COVID-19 Vaccination Coordination Cell has also been set up to support the Vaccine \nPreparedness and Deployment Core Committee in monitoring and supervision. ADB will augment \nthe capacity of this cell (paras. 21\u201322). \n \n16.  The DGHS is utilizing the EPI\u2019s logistics and cold chain network to support COVID-19 \nvaccination. To vaccinate 80% of the population within 24 months, a stock of 10 million\u201312 million \ndoses per month is required. As stated in the NDVP, a shortfall in cold chain capacity was present \nin 26 districts for vaccines to be stored at positive temperature (2\u00b0C\u20138\u00b0C). The DGHS has ensured \nadequate cold chain capacity by leveraging COVAX support of $2.4 million worth of cold chain \nequipment, to expand storage capacity to 19 million doses at a time. In addition, the DGHS plans \nto lease additional cold rooms at the central level. The DGHS has developed a monitoring and \nevaluation framework and implementation tools, including a monitoring dashboard, to track and \nmonitor the vaccine rollout. Several information technology (IT) systems are running in parallel, \nwith partial interoperability. These systems include the vaccine registration platform (Surokkha), \nthe AEFI portal, the vaccine logistics management system, and the national COVID-19 telehealth \nservices. The government is collaborating with the United Nations Development Programme and \nADB  to  develop  an  integrated  and  interoperable  IT  system  to track vaccines  and  monitor \nvaccinations, which will include a platform for a grievance redress mechanism (para. 21). An \nindividual case management system is also being developed to track cases from registration to \nissuance of QR coded certificates, and enable management of cases at all service points. \n \n \n39 The following development partners have shown strong indicative interest in supporting operational costs: German \ndevelopment cooperation through KfW (\u20ac220 million), Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (\u20ac150 million) and the \nJapan International Cooperation Agency.   \n40 The government has confirmed that vaccines provided as a grant through COVAX will be used. In addition, the World \nBank  COVID-19  pandemic  assistance  grant  for  the  displaced  persons  from  Myanmar  (the  Government  of \nBangladesh uses the term \u201cforcibly displaced Myanmar nationals [FDMN]\u201d) will be restructured to fund operational \ncosts. WHO and UNICEF are providing technical support for vaccine deployment at the camps in Cox\u2019s Bazaar.  \n41 The role of the central government includes planning, coordination, resource mobilization, financing and procurement \nof vaccines, and maintaining cold chain facilities. The local governments provide trained human resources, undertake \ncommunication, and monitor outreach activities.  \n42 Micro-level planning includes the place, date, hours of operation, target population, vaccination team members, \nsupervisor, vaccine and logistics requirements, and distribution plan. \n ", " \n8 \n17.  Immunization waste management. Building on its MWM experience,43 the government \nhas  prepared  a  detailed  COVID-19  immunization  waste  management  plan  that  includes \nsegregation at the health care facility, collection, and transportation to the designated waste \ntreatment and disposal site.44 Centralized MWM is proposed in Dhaka. The vaccine working \ngroups  for  districts,  upazilas,  and  city  corporations  will  be  responsible  for  vaccine  waste \nmanagement under their jurisdictions, following the existing national policy on injection safety. \nThe DGHS has trained 2,200 doctors, nurses, and other staff from 240 health facilities on infection \nprevention and control. Offsite waste management, related technologies, stakeholder capacity in \nawareness and monitoring, and a web portal for MWM need to be enhanced. These will be \nsupported by ongoing ADB and World Bank projects, and ADB TA (paras. 21 and 36). \n \n18.  Reaching women, the marginalized, and hard-to-reach. While vaccine hesitancy is \nhistorically low in Bangladesh,45 potential challenges to vaccinating women and the marginalized \nin rural and remote areas stem from barriers such as transport costs and accessibility to the \nnearest vaccination site. Lack of connectivity, technological know-how, and information on the \nvaccination process also pose challenges as the registration for vaccination is an online process. \nThe government plans to expand vaccination sites to union and community levels and operate \nmobile  vaccination  camps,  but  this  will  depend  on  adequate  vaccine  supply.  To  increase \nregistration and vaccinations in remote areas, the DGHS has partnered with nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs), religious and ethnic leaders, and community health workers to conduct \nregistration drives. The government is engaging with development partners, including the World \nBank,  the  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund  (UNICEF),  and  ADB  to  develop  communication \nmaterials and tools (para. 22). It is also operating a helpline. To vaccinate the displaced persons \nfrom Myanmar, the DGHS is partnering with United Nations agencies, NGOs, mothers\u2019 and \nwomen\u2019s groups, and community leaders in the camps to generate awareness about vaccines \nand the vaccination process, including registration and vaccination.  \n \n4.  Development Partner Coordination \n \n19.  The COVID-19 Vaccine Preparedness and Deployment Core Committee coordinates \ntechnical and financial assistance from development partners. The committee, which is led by the \nDGHS, includes representatives from the government and development partners, including ADB, \nthe World Bank, WHO, UNICEF, and the United States Agency for International Development. \nThe committee was engaged in preparing the NDVP, and supports its implementation and \nmonitoring. The coordination meetings are held on a monthly basis. ADB is a key member of the \ncommittee, fulfilling a large unmet need for vaccine financing and gaps in monitoring and \nevaluation systems, and vaccine communication and outreach in rural areas. ADB has held \nseveral rounds of discussions with all development partners to identify areas of complementarity \nand  synergy,  and  to  avoid  duplication  of  efforts.  A  separate  subcommittee  supports  the \nvaccination of the displaced persons from Myanmar, comprising government representatives, \n \n43 Government of Bangladesh, MOHFW, DGHS. 2011.

Project Description \n \n20.  The project is aligned with the following impact: accelerated health, social, and economic \nrecovery of the COVID-19 affected population in Bangladesh (footnote 27). The project will have \nthe following outcome: target populations vaccinated against COVID-19.47 \n \n21.  Output: Safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines delivered. The project will support the \nprocurement  of  safe  and  effective  vaccines  against  COVID-19  through  APVAX\u2019s  RRC,  in \ncompliance with ADB\u2019s vaccine eligibility criteria. It will procure an estimated 44.7 million doses \nof vaccines, which will be administered to 20.13 million Bangladeshis by 2024 based on the \nNDVP. The eligible vaccines will be procured through either COVAX, UNICEF, or bilateral \narrangements with vaccine manufacturers or distributors. The government expects to swiftly \nintroduce the vaccines to the population, following the NDVP and vaccination protocols and \nstandards, including those governing waste management and monitoring of AEFI. In addition, \nongoing TA resources of $1.7 million will support strengthening of the vaccine delivery system, \nincluding (i) technical experts to augment the capacity of the COVID-19 Vaccination Coordination \nCell; (ii) capacity building of vaccinators in online registration and generating vaccination cards in \nrural and hard-to-reach areas; (iii) upgrading the interoperability of vaccine-related IT systems to \nimprove tracking and monitoring of vaccines, cold chain and logistics, AEFI, and MWM, including \nfeatures to flag gender-differentiated gaps and benefits; and (iv) strengthening MWM practices \nby revising guidelines, training materials, and the web portal to enhance monitoring (footnote 2). \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n22.  The project will contribute to the government\u2019s NDVP to address the unmet need for \nvaccine procurement to inoculate 20.13 million Bangladeshis or 11.6% of its population. The \nproject builds on previous ADB support to contain and address COVID-19, as well as its long-\nterm engagement in improving access to primary health care services in urban areas.48 These \nprojects have affirmed the need for strengthening health systems, enhancing resilience, and \nimproving universal health coverage to reach the poor and the marginalized. Based on these \nexperiences,  ongoing  ADB  TA  will  add  significant  value.  Enhancing  interoperability  among \nvaccine-related  IT  systems  will  maximize  efficiency  and  strengthen  the  overall  vaccine \nmanagement system. Strengthening capacity and systems for vaccine delivery in rural and hard-\nto-reach areas will ensure better implementation and equitable distribution of vaccines in future \npandemics. Support to strengthen the COVID-19 Vaccination Coordination Cell will be critical for \nthe overall coordination and implementation of the vaccination program. Strengthening MWM and \nweb-based monitoring across different administrative levels is likely to incur benefits for the overall \nimmunization program. In addition, separate TA resources will enhance equitable access to \nvaccination in remote areas through mobile registration and vaccination teams, and gender-\nsensitive communication on vaccination process and vaccine safety.49  \n \n \n46 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n47 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n48 ADB.

Key findings from the debt sustainability analysis. Public debt in Bangladesh is \nestimated at $125 billion in FY2020 (38.6% of GDP) and external public and publicly guaranteed \ndebt is estimated at $51 billion (about 15.5% of GDP). The debt sustainability analysis confirmed \nthe debt sustainability of Bangladesh with the additional financing for the procurement of COVID-\n19 vaccines and other expected additional borrowings. With the additional $4.22 billion of external \nborrowings and $150.00 million of domestic financing, the external public and publicly guaranteed \ndebt-to-GDP ratio will increase to 16.5% and the public debt-to-GDP ratio will increase to 40.8% \nin FY2021. Both the external debt ratio and the public debt ratio will remain stable over the \nmedium term, with all external debt and public debt indicators well below the threshold levels for \ndebt burden indicators, even under various stress scenarios.51 \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n27.  The Finance Division of the Ministry of Finance will be the executing agency and the \nDGHS under the Health Services Division, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW) will \nbe the implementing agency of the project. The Finance Division will manage the advance \naccount and the DGHS will procure the vaccines. A program monitoring unit (PMU) will be \nestablished under the DGHS to provide implementation support and monitor the project before \nloan disbursement (Table 5). The PMU will be staffed with a dedicated program director, deputy \nprogram director, and financial management and procurement staff. ADB TA will support the \nengagement of individual consultants (procurement, financial management, and audit experts) to \nassist the PMU.52   \n \n28.  Procurement will be undertaken in a manner consistent with simplified and expedient \nprocedures permitted under the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) \nand Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). Since \nthe project will be financed under APVAX, ADB member country eligibility restrictions will be \nwaived and universal procurement will apply. The procurement of a proportion of the vaccines \nmay be done through COVAX. In addition, given the severely constrained vaccine market, the \nMOHFW may negotiate directly with vaccine manufacturers to agree on bilateral contracts, and \ndirect contracting with UNICEF. Before being confirmed as an eligible expenditure under the loan, \nADB will review all bilateral vaccine agreements. Value for money in procurement will be achieved \nby (i) selecting vaccines that are best suited to the domestic supply chain; (ii) identifying vaccines \nthat will efficiently meet the project disbursement conditions; (iii) engaging with manufacturers \nthat have advantageous vaccine delivery timelines; and (iv) entering into agreements on terms \n \n51 Debt Sustainability Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n52 The TA will be utilized for PMU consultant support.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic Viability \n \n30.  The COVID-19 pandemic is both a health and an economic crisis, which has resulted in \nloss of lives, an increase in morbidity, loss of livelihoods, a slowdown of the economy, and \ndisruptions to education and human capital development necessary for long-term economic \ngrowth. In the absence of vaccinations, the costs of the pandemic could be prolonged and \nexacerbated. The achievement of herd immunity from COVID-19 through vaccinations will result \n \n53 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", " \n13 \nin substantially reduced mortality and morbidity, and help get the economy back on track by \nenabling the resumption of economic activities and thus restore livelihoods. \n \nB.  Governance \n \n31.  A  financial  management  assessment  has  been  conducted  for  the  project,  including \ninventory management, data management, accounting, oversight, and audit. The assessed pre-\nmitigation financial management risk is substantial because of the (i) scale and complexity of the \nproject, (ii) potential funding challenges, and (iii) lack of fully integrated systems for tracking the \nvaccine  distribution  and  for  managing  inventory.  Measures  to  ensure  accountability, \ntransparency, and good governance include (i) each batch of vaccines purchased with ADB \nsupport being assigned a unique batch number that will be tracked and reported by the vaccine \nlogistics management information system; and (ii) in addition to the annual project financial audit, \nan annual performance audit focusing on good governance will be conducted by the auditor \ngeneral and submitted yearly to ADB. A designated PMU will be established and staffed before \nproject implementation, which will be supported by financial management consultants. Direct \npayment procedures may be used for eligible high-value contracts.  \n \n32.  Bangladesh  has  legislative  frameworks  to  prevent  corruption.  However,  adequate \nimplementation remains a challenge.54 ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) \nwas explained to and discussed with the government.55 The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 53).  \n \nC.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n33.  Poverty and social considerations. Multiple factors have adversely affected incomes \nand poverty levels as a result of the pandemic, including (i) the shutdown of predominantly urban \nformal industries earlier in the pandemic period, (ii) internal movement of informal workers to rural \nareas increasing labor supply, and (iii) increased inflows of returning overseas Bangladeshi \nmigrant workers. Economic disruption, together with low health insurance coverage and high out-\nof-pocket  expenses,  could  present  significant  cost  barriers  to  immunization  (e.g.,  through \ntransport and mobility costs and consultation costs)\u2014costs which often affect the poor and \nvulnerable groups the most. The NDVP highlights that the vaccine will be made available free of \ncharge, reducing cost entry barriers, and will be deployed at the community level and through \noutreach campaigns where possible, thus helping to reduce cost and financial barriers to access. \n \n34.  Gender.  The  project  is  categorized  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  TA  resources \n(footnote 2) will support the following gender-related actions: (i) 50% women vaccinators trained \nin online registration and generating vaccination cards to encourage vaccination of women in rural \nareas; (ii) strengthen the interoperability of existing vaccine-related IT systems to generate \nintegrated data sets, including automated triggers on specific measures such as the registration \nand vaccination rate, number and sex of vaccinators, AEFI, highlighting gaps, including on \ngender, for appropriate action to be taken; and (iii) the COVID-19 Vaccination Coordination Cell \nwill be staffed with 30% women technical experts, and all women staff in the cell will be trained \non vaccination and relevant issues. In addition, separate TA (footnote 49) will strengthen women\u2019s \nparticipation in the vaccination process and increase vaccination coverage among women in \n \n54 Transparency  International:  Corruption  Perceptions  Index  and  World  Bank  governance  ratings  indicate  that \nimprovement is required in Bangladesh\u2019s performance on anticorruption.   \n55 ADB TA will support integrity knowledge management session/s for the Ministry of Finance, DGHS, MOHFW, and \nother project stakeholders to increase their awareness and compliance with ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy. ADB. 2018. \nTechnical Assistance for Capacity Building and Integrity. Manila (TA 9703).  \n ", " \n14 \nselected rural and remote areas. These include (i) local level consultations with community \nleaders to encourage women\u2019s registration and vaccination; (ii) reaching women through mobile \nregistration and vaccination teams in hard-to-reach areas, following the prioritization plan; (iii) \ndeveloping gender-sensitive communication materials on the COVID-19 vaccination process and \nvaccine safety; (iv) providing separate vaccination booths for men and women; and (v) supporting \nfemale vaccinators to encourage women\u2019s vaccination.  \n \nD.  Safeguards \n \n35.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.56 \n \n36.  Environment (category C). The project will support the procurement of vaccines and will \nnot entail civil works or other activities with potential for significant adverse impacts on the \nenvironment. The distribution and use of COVID-19 vaccines will result in a temporary increase \nin immunization waste.57 The NDVP defines immunization waste management arrangements and \nresponsibilities, and includes a training program for local health care facilities on handling \nimmunization waste. Immunization waste will be managed in compliance with the Bangladesh \nMedical Waste (Management and Processing) Rules of 2008, COVID-19-Related Medical Waste \nManagement  Guidelines  and  Standard  Operating  Procedure,  and  Infectious  Diseases \n(Prevention, Control and Elimination) Act of 2018.58 The government aims to modernize MWM \nthrough the provision of autoclaves and dual-chamber incinerators, and the establishment of \neffluent treatment plants in all government medical colleges, specialized hospitals, and district \nhospitals during 2021\u20132024. ADB is supporting the preparation of a site-specific MWM plan for \n45 health care facilities in eight districts through the ongoing Urban Primary Health Care Services \nDelivery Project. The World Bank-supported COVID-19 Emergency Response and Pandemic \nPreparedness project is supporting MWM in 10 medical colleges and hospitals as well as \ngovernment hospitals in 10 districts, and establishing new facilities for MWM in 14 districts. \n \n37.  Involuntary resettlement (category C). The project will not require any land acquisition \nor lead to any involuntary resettlement impact. MWM will not result in civil works under the project. \nIf any civil works or other investments become necessary that could potentially result in impacts \non land and resources, the impacts will be screened and, if necessary, avoided, reduced, \nmitigated, or compensated in line with international best practice and/or the ADB Safeguard Policy \nStatement. \n \n38.  Indigenous peoples (category C). While tribes, minor races, ethnic sects, and ethnic \ncommunities are present in the country, they will not be targeted as distinct and vulnerable \nindigenous peoples as a group, as defined by ADB\u2019s indigenous peoples safeguard policies. The \nproject will ensure that members of indigenous peoples groups will not be excluded and will not \nsuffer any disadvantages in targeting because of the fact of belonging to an indigenous peoples \ngroup. The project is not expected to have any direct or indirect impacts on the dignity, human \nrights, livelihood systems, or culture of indigenous peoples, or the territories or natural or cultural \nresources that indigenous peoples own, use, occupy, or claim as an ancestral domain or asset. \n \n \n56 ADB.

The overall assessment revealed that the procurement \nand contract management risk is substantial, but manageable. The DGHS and the Central \nMedical Stores Depot\u2019s overall procurement capacity is acceptable. However, these entities have \nlimited  experience  in  undertaking  procurement  following  ADB\u2019s  procurement  policies  and \nregulations, as well as limited knowledge in the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines. To mitigate \nthese constraints, ADB will assist the DGHS and the Central Medical Stores Depot with vaccine \nprocurement  by  advising  on  the  volatile  market  and  associated  procurement-related  risks, \nreviewing contracts under bilateral agreements, supporting price validation, and assisting in the \npreparations for negotiations with vaccine manufacturers. In addition, ADB TA will support a \nnational procurement consultant (footnote 52).  \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n40.
