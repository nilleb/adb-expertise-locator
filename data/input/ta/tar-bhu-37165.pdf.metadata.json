During the Country Programming Mission in April 2003, the Kingdom of Bhutan (the \nGovernment) requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide an additional technical \nassistance (TA) grant to strengthen the capacity of Department of Aid and Debt Management \n(DADM), following TA 3893: Strengthening the Debt Management Capacity of the Department \nof Aid and Debt Management.1  The request was congruent with the Government\u2019s efforts to \ndevelop its private sector. The TA was included in ADB's Country Strategy and Program Update \n2004\u20132006 for Bhutan.2 \n \n2.  The Fact-Finding Mission (the Mission) visited Bhutan on 1\u201310 March 2004, and met \nwith senior officials and technical staff from the Ministry of Finance (MOF), DADM, and Royal \nMonetary Authority (RMA). The Government and the Mission reached an understanding on the \nobjectives, scope, financing plan, and implementation details of the TA. The TA framework is \nprovided in Appendix 1. \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  One of the main objectives of the Government\u2019s Ninth Plan (2002\u20132007) was identified \nas good governance. To attain this goal, the Government streamlined resource management in \nthe public sector and monitored sovereign debt. However, given the scale of the task at hand, \nadditional assistance was needed to support the reform agenda. The Government requested TA \nfrom ADB during the Country Programming Mission in April 2002, for the express purpose of \nstrengthening Bhutan\u2019s debt management capacity. ADB responded with advisory TA 3893, \nwhich was approved on 4 July 2002, and was implemented in the first quarter of 2003. Two TA \nconsultants were engaged to develop the capacity of DADM staff to maintain a complete \ndatabase of external debt and to accurately assess systemic and exogenous risks associated \nwith the current debt portfolio of Bhutan.  \n \n4.  Under the TA, the following were carefully reviewed: (i) the institutional framework for \npublic sector borrowing; (ii) the management information system required for debt management; \n(iii)  the  legislative  and  regulatory  framework  for  borrowing,  on-lending,  and  government \nguarantees; (iv) debt and risk analysis; (v) borrowing policy and strategy; (vi) staffing and \ntraining requirements; and (vii) the need for a more structured public debt management in \nBhutan.  Recommendations  on  regulatory,  institutional,  and  operational  aspects  of  debt \nmanagement were made. The External Resources Management System (ERMS), the database \nused by DADM to monitor debt portfolio, was modified to follow the International Monetary Fund \n(IMF) format. The database is generated and managed using Excel and Access software \nprograms, and classifies assistance by funding source, and by public and private sector (for \ngovernment guarantee on on-lending to private sector). \n \n5.  The TA provided on-the-job training to DADM staff in debt management, risk analysis, \nand pertinent borrowing policy and strategies. In addition, staff from MOF\u2019s Department of \nBudget and Accounts and from RMA were familiarized with fundamental debt management \npolicy and issues.  Supported by the TA, five representatives from DADM and RMA went to the \nPhilippines and studied the debt management system used by Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, the \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004. Strengthening of the Debt Management Capacity of the Department of Aid and Debt Management. \nManila (TA 3893). \n2  The TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 13 May 2004. ", "2  \nCentral  Bank  of  the  Philippines,  with  a  view  to  translating  this  knowledge  into  proficient \nsovereign debt management in Bhutan. \n    \n6.  Following  completion  of  TA  3893,  a  number  of  issues  must  be  addressed  before \nDADM\u2019s debt management capacity is fully developed. In particular, public debt management \nshould be able to address the financing needs of the government, minimize borrowing costs, \nkeep risks associated with borrowing at an acceptable minimum, and provide feedback to \npolicy-makers for effective economic planning.  \n \n7.  In creating such a debt management system, first a debt policy must be developed for \nBhutan. The policy should formulate prudent management of the debt portfolio, and should \ndovetail seamlessly with Bhutan\u2019s public expenditure management and economic development \nplan. Second, a loan procedures and regulations manual should be developed as a framework \nfor the daily operations of DADM and other government institutions that work on external debt \nrelated topics. This framework should include operations issues pertaining to borrowing, debt \nmanagement, and sustainability of debt.  \n \n8.  Third,  necessary  hardware  and  software  should  be  available  to  support  a  more \nsophisticated  debt  monitoring  and  management  system.  Under  TA  3893,  the  ERMS  was \nredesigned to record and manage loans and grants. DADM uses two servers: one is assigned \nto daily use while the other acts as back-up. However, the ERMS is still embryonic and \nincomplete. Before descriptive reporting can be graduated into a more analytical approach to \ndebt and aid management, all pertinent information must be promptly and accurately recorded \non each loan, in accordance with established manuals and instructions. And debt management \nsoftware packages should  be reviewed, with a view to graduating to a more sophisticated \nrecording, monitoring, and management structure for sovereign debt. Software and computers \nto support such a system needs to be identified, procured, and made operational.  \n \n9.  Finally, debt management is not merely database maintenance. It incorporates issues \nsuch as optimal levels of borrowing, servicing of outstanding debt, risk analysis, on-lending, \nrecovery,  accounting,  and  budget  preparation.  And  the  capacity  to  perform  debt  and  risk \nanalysis  can  only  be  built  over  time,  as  it  requires  expertise  in  portfolio  analysis,  risk \nmanagement  techniques,  financial  management,  and  macroeconomics.  TA  3893  started \ncapacity  building  at  the  micro  level,  by  familiarizing  DADM  staff  with  the  basics  of  debt \nmanagement and risk analysis, using relatively simple data processing. To ensure sustainability, \nit is vital to develop and adopt a macro approach to debt management. Hence, in-house and \nexternal training should continue to develop staff capacity for analyzing debt-related data and \nmanaging risk from endogenous or exogenous shocks. DADM staff should be able to analyze \nthe actual and predicted exposures to external risks, which in turn would facilitate informed \nmanagement of the debt portfolio.  DADM should also be able to generate analytical status \nreports periodically so that information gleaned from debt management can feed into policy \ndecisions.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n10.  The ultimate goal is to develop a comprehensive, forward-looking debt strategy, with a \nlong-term macroeconomic sustainability focus in Bhutan. This TA will build on the findings and \noutputs of TA 3893, and support further development of the debt management capacity of \nDADM. More specifically, the TA will support the following tasks: (i) developing a debt policy to ", "           3\n \nrecord  and  manage  current  debt  as  well  as  to  guide  future  borrowing  decisions  of  the \nGovernment;  (ii)  preparing  a  loan  procedures  and  regulations  manual;  (iii)  designing  and \noperationalizing  a  complete  and  consolidated  database  on  all  loans  and  grants;  and  (iv) \nproviding in-house and external training for staff in the proficient use of a computerized debt \nmanagement system, sound management of the existing debt portfolio, comprehensive risk \nanalysis, and a prescriptive analysis of the scope for a new borrowing position vis-\u00e0-vis the \ncountry's repayment capacity and development strategy.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  This TA will support the following activities. (i) A debt  policy, in accord with the \nstrategic  development  plan  of  the  economy,  will  be  drafted.  (ii)  A  loan  procedures  and \nregulations manual will be developed. (iii) Equipment and software necessary for efficient debt \nmanagement will be provided to DADM, of MOF. (iv) Provision of equipment and software will \nbe supported through training given to staff of DADM, RMA, and other government offices \nworking on debt-management-related activities. This training will include means of interfacing \nbetween the existing and new systems, fully using all features of the new software to prepare \ndescriptive and prescriptive reports for internal and external use, as well as basic trouble-\nshooting to maintain the newly-created debt management database during daily operations. (v) \nExternal training on international borrowing and debt management will be provided to a staff \nmember from DADM\u2019s Loans Division.3   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $270,000 equivalent, comprising $220,000 in \nforeign exchange and $50,000 equivalent in local currency costs.  ADB will finance $225,000 \nequivalent, which includes the entire foreign currency costs and $5,000 in local currency costs. \nThe TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB's TA funding program. The Government will \ncontribute the remaining $45,000 equivalent in kind as office space and facilities, counterpart \nstaff, local transportation, and administrative and clerical support. ADB's financing will be used \nfor (i) acquiring the services of an international consultant, (ii) organizing workshops and \nproviding training as required to counterpart staff, and (iii) acquiring the equipment and software \nnecessary to implement the new debt management system. The detailed cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are provided in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  DADM, MOF, will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The Director of DADM will \noversee TA implementation. The TA will be implemented during a 9-month period starting in \nNovember 2004 and ending by August 2005. Two counterpart staff people will be nominated \nfrom DADM, and will work closely with the TA consultants to facilitate timely and effective TA \nimplementation.  \n \n14.  ADB  will  engage  two  individual  international  consultants,  in  accordance with its \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants to provide the required consulting services, for a total of 6 \nperson-months (3 each). Consultancy services will be delivered intermittently. The consultants \nwill be engaged through direct selection to ensure expeditious provision of consultancy services \nto  DADM  for  debt  management.  The  consultants  identified  for  the  consultancy  have  had \nexperience working on debt management with DADM or other counterpart organizations in the \n                                                 \n3   Other staff members of the Loans Division have gone through similar external training. ", "4  \nSouth Asia region; thus they  possess the specific type of expertise required for satisfactory \nimplementation of this TA. The consultant team will comprise a public debt management \nspecialist  and  a  debt  management  systems  specialist.  The  consultants  will  review  the \nrecommendations of TA 3893 on the medium- and long-term needs of DADM in managing debt, \nand translate them into a debt management strategy and a debt policy for Bhutan. The TA \nconsultants will also assist in institutional capacity building of DADM in identification, design, \nand/or procurement of computer programs necessary for recording, monitoring, and managing \ndebt, as well as computer hardware and other office equipment to support the new debt \nmanagement system. The outline terms of reference are provided in Appendix 3.  \n \n15.  The consultants will prepare (i) an inception report, within 15 days of their fielding, \nincluding a needs-based assessment and an action plan; (ii) a midterm report, 1.5 months after \nfielding; (iii) a draft final report for the TA, to be submitted 2 weeks before the end of the \nconsulting term; and (iv) a final report, at the end of the consulting assignment. All reports will \nbe submitted (in hard and soft copies) to both DADM and ADB for review and comments. \nConsultants will duly incorporate the comments received from DADM and ADB while finalizing \nthe reports. The findings and recommendations of the inception report and the draft final report \nwill be discussed during tripartite meetings. \n \n16.  Additional computer software and hardware will  be needed to implement the new \nsystem. The consultants will identify the software and hardware that will support the new \nclearing  system.  Equipment  and  computer  hardware  and  software  will  be  procured  in \naccordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  After  the  completion  of  the  TA,  all \nequipment purchased under the TA will be turned over to the Government. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $225,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Bhutan for Strengthening the Debt Management Capacity of the Department \nof Aid and Debt Management, and hereby reports this action to the Board.
