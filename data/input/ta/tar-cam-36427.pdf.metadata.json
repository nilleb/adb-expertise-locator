In August 2001, the National Assembly of Cambodia enacted a land law, prepared by \nthe Ministry of Land Management, Urban Planning and Construction (MLMUPC) with technical \nassistance (TA)1 from the Asian Development Bank (ADB).  At the time that the land law was \nunder governmental consideration, the Government of Cambodia asked ADB for assistance to \nfurther develop and implement land legislation.  TA was provided to meet this request.2  That TA \nwill be completed in August 2003.  The Government of Cambodia has now asked ADB for \nfurther assistance to continue developing and implementing land-related legal instruments.  This \nTA is included in the 2003 country assistance program for Cambodia as part of the overall TA \nprogram to improve governance.  The ADB Fact-Finding Mission visited Cambodia from 7 to 12 \nMay 20033 and reached an understanding with the Government on the objectives, scope, cost \nestimates, and implementation arrangements for the TA.4  The TA framework is attached as \nAppendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Cambodia, after a prolonged period of war, internal unrest, and uncertainty for the \ngeneral population, has now stabilized and the Government is focusing on restoring the country \nto a state ruled by law.  One of the most pressing issues in Cambodia is the subject of land\u2014 \nwho owns it, who can acquire it, and how these rights are validated.  While a comprehensive \nlegal framework in which to administer and adjudicate land disputes and land ownership in \ngeneral is now in place, a wide range of regulatory instruments are needed to address state \nownership of land and the uses to which that land is put.    \n \n3.  In August 2001 the National Assembly promulgated a revised land law.  As is standard \nprocedure in the Cambodian legal system, laws usually consist primarily of general principles.  \nThese principles are not specific enough to provide the guidance needed in actual application of \nthe law.  Thus, actual application of these principles depends on promulgation of subdecrees by \nthe Council of Ministers and implementing regulations by the relevant ministries.   \n \n4.  The  2001  land  law  required  promulgation  of  some  16  subdecrees  in  order  to  be \neffectively implemented.5  Most of the subdecrees required drafting by MLMUPC, a relatively \nnew ministry that was established in 1999 and has limited resources available to it for legislative \ndrafting and training.  In addition, extensive training was needed in the 2001 land law by several \nsectors of society, including the judiciary, members of the public who needed to protect rights to \nland, and officials charged with implementing the land law, specifically MLMUPC officials and \nother government officials concerned with land issues.  \n \n5.  Among the priority subdecrees needed under the 2001 land law was a means by which \nto ensure a fair and just resolution of land disputes.  The recent history of land ownership in \nCambodia  has  resulted  in  numerous  land  rights'  disputes  and  the  judiciary  has  been \noverwhelmed by land dispute cases, while also being poorly trained in the law.  In accordance \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1996. Technical Assistance to Cambodia for Agriculture Policy Reform Support. Manila. \n2    ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance to Cambodia for Implementation of Land Legislation. Manila. \n3    The mission comprised R. Thami, mission leader. \n4  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 20 February 2003. \n5   Among other things, the needed subdecrees addressed land registration by indigenous communities, organization \nand functioning of cadastral commissions, social concessions, procedures to reduce land concessions or exempt \nthem from size limits, zoning, construction, easements, cadastral administration, sporadic registration procedures, \nand cadastral surveys and maps. ", "2  \nwith the 2001 land law, a subdecree and implementing regulations were needed to establish a \ncadastral commission system with the jurisdiction to resolve land disputes.   \n \n6.  Poor  rural  people  in  Cambodia  have  been  marginalized  and,  for  various  reasons, \nincluding confiscatory actions by powerful people and the need for emergency funds, have \neither lost or sold their land.  Their resultant landlessness has left them without a means of \nsubsistence,  and  social  concessions  (land  granted  by  the  state  to  poor  households  for \nsubsistence farming) are an equitable method by which to restore and empower them.  A \nsubdecree was needed to establish a process whereby such social concessions could be \ngranted for residential use and subsistence cultivation.   \n \n7.  TA 3577 (\"phase 1 TA\") (footnote 2) met the need for subdecrees by supporting the \ndrafting of two major priority legal texts.  Prior to drafting these texts, a process was established \nfor first conceptualizing and then drafting, providing room for public consultation.  The process is \nmanaged  by  the  Council  for  Land  Policy  (CLP),  an  interministerial  committee  chaired  by \nMLMUPC and charged with issuing policy statements on land issues.  These policy statements \nare the basis for the legal texts, which must reflect officially sanctioned Government policy.  The \ndrafting process includes at least two public consultations, redrafting in light of public comments, \nand preparation of a legislative history and other background information explaining specific \nprovisions  of  the  subdecree.    The  process  of  an  extensive  public  comment  period  and \npreparation  of  a  legislative  history  with  supporting  background  information  has  proven a \nsuccess in ensuring ownership by MLMUPC of the  subdecrees it has proposed.  Using the \nprocess, the Subdecree on the Organization and Functioning of the cadastral commissions and \nthe Subdecree on Social Concessions were both drafted, approved by the CLP-MLMUPC, and \ngiven final approval by the Council of Ministers under the phase 1 TA.   \n \n8.  A  vast  need  for  training  exists  at  all  levels  to  address  the  generally  low  level  of \ninformation made available to government officials and the judiciary.  Recent changes to the \nland law magnify this need for additional training, which must address the public\u2019s need for \nincreased knowledge of its property rights.  A national literacy rate of approximately 68% also \nnecessitates information dissemination designed for an illiterate audience.   \n \n9.  To  meet  identified  training  needs,  the  phase  1  TA  engaged  in  extensive  training \nprograms.  These included short-term training for MLMUPC and Ministry of Justice officials, \nmembers of the judiciary, and nongovernment organization (NGO) staff in acquisition of land, \nconsultation with members of commune councils in procedural preparation for social land \nconcessions, preparation of a land law textbook for teaching purposes, and dispute resolution \ntraining for cadastral commissions jointly with the Land Management and Administrative Project \n(LMAP), a program funded by several external agencies (para. 11).    \n \n10.  The phase 1 TA also developed a video with accompanying cartoon book for public \ninformation and the video has been regularly broadcast on television.  The cartoon book has \nbeen widely distributed throughout Cambodia and is essentially the script to the broadcast \nvideo.  This serves to reinforce a message on protection of land rights that is accessible to an \nilliterate population.  A second video on dispute resolution is being finalized, and training videos \nin dispute resolution have been prepared and widely used.   \n \n11.  The phase 1 TA was carried out in coordination with the LMAP, funded by the World \nBank and the governments of Finland and Germany.  The LMAP's objectives are to develop \nnational policies, a regulatory framework, and strengthened institutions while also issuing and \nregistering land titles and establishing an efficient and transparent land administration system.  ", "  3\n \n \nThe LMAP was not fully in place at the time the phase 1 TA commenced, but, upon its \nestablishment, coordination arrangements between the phase 1 TA and LMAP were developed.  \nFor example, training programs were conducted by the phase 1 TA using LMAP funds for travel \nand per diem costs while the ADB team prepared training materials and conducted the training \nsessions.  The LMAP and ADB have agreed on a future division of labor6 for drafting legal texts \nand coordination will continue in all areas.  Further, the LMAP Central Project Management \nOffice at MLMUPC will be the counterpart for the ADB team, thereby ensuring coordination by \nall agencies working with MLMUPC. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n12.  The objectives of this phase 2 TA are to (i) continue assisting in drafting priority laws, \nsubdecrees, and implementing regulations (collectively referred to as legal texts); (ii) build the \ncapacity of government officials concerned with legal and land matters, as well as cadastral \ncommission members, the judiciary and members of civil society, such as NGO staff; and (iii) \nraise public awareness of the land law and its implementing regulations in order to increase \npeople's access to mechanisms to realize their rights under the law.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n13.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 2 years and comprises three components. \n \n14.  Drafting of Legal Texts.  Some of the legal texts that are most needed concern (i) \nmanagement of state-owned land (estimated to constitute about 70-80% of Cambodia's land \nmass); (ii) classification and reclassification of state-owned public land (which is not available for \nany private purpose) and state-owned private land (which may be converted to private use or for \nuse in social land concessions); (iii) sale of state-owned private land; (iv) granting of economic \nland concessions and the reduction in size of previously granted economic land concessions \nthat exceed limits permissible under the 2001 land law;7 and (v) granting of state-owned private \nland for social purposes.  The TA will provide assistance in drafting these specific legal texts, \nusing as a model the participatory drafting process involving civil society and stakeholders \ndeveloped under the phase 1 TA (para. 7).  Items (i)-(iii) all concern state land management and \nmay  be  the  subject  of  one  law  or  multiple  subdecrees,  as  will  be  determined  by  the \nGovernment.    Item  (iv),  a  subdecree  on  the  granting  of  new  economic  concessions  and \nreducing existing economic concessions, will use an interministerial working group under the \nguidance of the CLP, in addition to the participatory process described in para. 7.  Item (v), \nwhich  has  already  been  promulgated  as  a  subdecree  under  the  phase  1  TA,  requires \nimplementing guidelines.8 \n \n15.  Training and Capacity Building.  Staff from smaller NGOs working at the grassroots \nlevel will be trained to assist and represent parties in land disputes at the cadastral commission, \nas these parties would be unable to retain legal representation from official practitioners.  Efforts \n                                                 \n6    This was agreed upon in May 2003 when the ADB Fact-Finding Mission (footnote 3) joined the World Bank \nReview Mission of the Land Management and Administration Project. \n7   This subdecree is also addressed in the proposed agriculture sector development program, and will assist in its \nimplementation. \n8   To the extent applicable, consideration will be given in these guidelines to the recommendations developed under  \nRETA 5935 (ADB. 2000.  Regional Technical Assistance on National Resettlement Policy Enhancement and \nCapacity Building. Manila). ", "4  \nwill be made to include female NGO staff.  In coordination with the LMAP, the TA will provide \nfollow-up  training  to  cadastral  commission  members  in  dispute  resolution  procedures, \nsupplementing initial training received under the phase 1 TA.  Also in coordination with the \nLMAP, selected lawyers in the MLMUPC Legal Department will receive on-the-job training in \nlegislative  drafting  techniques  and  procedures  in  order  to  build  capacity  within  the  Legal \nDepartment to manage ongoing and future legislative drafting functions.  In addition, a training \nprogram will be developed at the Royal School for Magistracy (RSM) to train judges and \nprosecutors, using the land law textbook developed under the Phase 1 TA.9  Staff from the land \nregistry offices will be included so as to develop a mutual understanding among the judiciary \nand staff involved in technical aspects of land titling.  The exact structure of the training program \nwill be finalized by the consultants in consultation with MLMUPC and RSM.  \n \n16.  Dissemination of Information to the Public.  Materials developed under the phase 1 \nTA, such as a cartoon book and videos explaining the land law in simple terms, will be further \ndisseminated, and additional videos and informational books or leaflets will be produced.  The \npublic education program will include preparation and broadcasting of radio and television \nprograms, preparation and distribution of brochures and posters, and other methods to reach \nilliterate people.  The lessons learned under the regional TA for Legal Literacy for Supporting \nGovernance10 will be taken into account.  The information program will be carried out in close \ncooperation with NGOs and civil society and efforts will be made to ensure women are reached \nby the information program.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n17.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $710,000  equivalent,  comprising  foreign \nexchange costs of $418,500 and local currency costs of $291,500 equivalent.  ADB will finance \nthe full foreign exchange cost and $181,500 equivalent of the local currency expenditure.  The \nTA will be financed on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA funding program.  The Government will \nfinance the balance of the local currency cost, equivalent to $110,000, through the provision of \ntraining facilities, accommodation for the trainees, counterpart staff, office accommodation with \nthe equipment provided under the phase 1 TA, local communications, logistical support, radio \nand television broadcasting time, and documents and data at the disposal of the Government as \nnecessary for TA implementation.  The cost estimates and financing plan are attached as \nAppendix 2.   \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  Executing Agency.  The Executing Agency will be MLMUPC.  Drafting legal texts will \nensue after CLP has promulgated policy statements that, depending on the subject matter, will \ninvolve other relevant ministries that are not already members of CLP.  The Government has \nestablished  the  Working  Group  for  Preparing  the  Draft  Sub-Decree  on  Economic  Land \nConcessions under the guidance of CLP.  MLMUPC will assign two qualified lawyers from its \nLegal Department to draft legal texts with assistance from the TA consultants.  For the training \ncomponent, MLMUPC will ensure participation of land registry staff, as required.  RSM will make \nfacilities available for teaching.    \n \n                                                 \n9   Initial training courses will have 55 students who are newly appointed judges or prosecutors.  Continuing education \nprograms for sitting judges and prosecutors are proposed to have 20\u201325 students in each two-week course, \nsubject to approval by the Government. \n10 ADB. 1999. Regional Technical Assistance for Legal Literacy for Supporting Governance. Manila. ", "  5\n \n \n19.  Selection of Consultants and Procurement.  About 20 person-months of international \nand 24 person-months of domestic consulting will be required.  A firm, comprising a team of \ninternational and domestic consultants, will be selected and engaged by ADB using the quality-\nand  cost-based  selection  method  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic \nconsultants.  The consultants will be responsible for managing the TA; assisting in drafting legal \ntexts; developing the training curriculum; developing training materials; managing the logistics of \nthe training and delivering the training; and, in association with suitable NGOs, producing and \ndelivering public information materials and assisting poor and illiterate people in realizing their \nrights under the land law.  Outline terms of  reference for the consultants are attached as \nAppendix 3.  Local resource persons with knowledge of and experience in the subject matter will \nbe used in the training and information dissemination programs.  The resource persons will be \nselected in consultation between MLMUPC and ADB.  Office equipment (computers, printers, \nand photocopier) and training equipment and materials will be procured by the consultants in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement although much equipment procured under \nthe phase 1 TA will be available to the phase 2 TA.   \n \n20.  TA Evaluation.  The consultants will develop an evaluation system to measure the \nimpact of the training and information dissemination programs.  This system, and benchmarks \nfor evaluation, will be established prior to the start of the training program and the dissemination \nprogram.   \n \n21.  Implementation Schedule.  Implementation can begin as soon as consultant selection \nis completed, which is expected to be 1 November 2003.   The TA will be implemented over 24 \nmonths and completed on 31 October 2005.  \n \n22.  TA Review and Reporting.  In  the  first  month  of  implementation,  a  TA  inception \nmission from ADB will hold a tripartite meeting with MLMUPC and the consultants to discuss the \nwork program and detailed working arrangements, as well as confirm assignment of counterpart \nstaff.  Further tripartite meetings will be held semiannually after commencement of the TA and \nabout 2 months before TA completion.  The consultants will prepare inception, semiannual, \nmidterm, and final reports; the final versions of these will reflect the comments made by the \nGovernment and ADB during the tripartite meetings.   \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of
