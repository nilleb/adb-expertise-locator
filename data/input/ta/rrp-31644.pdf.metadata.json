Subsequently,  what  began  as  a  financial  crisis\nrapidly  spilled  over  to  the  real  sectors  revealing  significant\nremaining  policy  distortions.  The  industry  sector  has  been\naffected  by  a  legacy  of  discretionary,  nontransparent,  and\nanticompetitive practices that inhibited structural change and led\nto a highly concentrated industrial structure biased in favor of\nlarge firms. The restraints to competition have imposed costs\nthrough higher prices, limited consumer and business choice,\ncross-subsidies benefiting inefficient firms at the cost of efficient\nfirms, and inadequate incentives for innovation and efficiency.\nFurthermore,  a  complex  system  of  approvals,  licenses,  and\npermits has imposed significant operational costs on business\u2013\nespecially for SMEs. This regulatory system continues to impede\nthe efficient allocation of resources and the ability of domestic\nfirms to compete effectively in overseas markets and against\nimports.\nComplex and burdensome license and approval procedures for\nboth  domestic  and  foreign  investment,  and  insufficient  weight\ngiven to the promotional and facilitation role of the investment\ncoordination  agency  have  created  significant  impediments  to\nefforts to attract and promote investment. The legal basis for\nforeign investment policies and institutions remains unchanged\nfrom  the  1960s,  and  gives  limited  assurances  of  safety  and\nsecurity to both domestic and foreign investors. Nontransparent\ncustoms procedures delay shipments and undermine the impact\nof policy liberalization. The uncertainty and risk resulting from this\nsystem  have  compounded  the  ongoing  crisis  of  investor\nconfidence.\nAssistance to the SME sector has achieved only limited success\nin mitigating SME difficulties in operating in a nontransparent and\ncomplex regulatory environment. Targeted assistance for SMEs\nhas often not been cost effective and subsidized credit schemes\nin particular have led to incentive distortions, weakening of credit\nculture, nonrepayment, and misallocation of resources.\nThe economic crisis calls for decisive policy signals to ensure\nmarket efficiency; restore confidence of investors, lenders, and\nproducers;  and  position  the  economy  for  recovery.  This  will\nrequire rationalizing the trade and industrial regime to promote", "iii\nderegulation and competition and thus provide assurances that\nmarkets will operate more efficiently and transparently, so that\nwhen resources are committed to commercial activities, there are\nreasonable prospects that they will be employed productively.\nObjective  The Program\u2019s objective is to support economic recovery and\nand Scope sustained growth by encouraging a more diversified and efficient\nindustrial structure through deregulation and adoption of policies\nthat promote competition, and provide a level playing field for all\nenterprises  including  SMEs.  This  is  to  be  achieved  by\n(i) strengthening  competition,  (ii) promoting  investment  and\nfacilitating trade, and (iii) rationalizing assistance to SMEs. The\nindustrial deregulation and liberalization will promote industrial\ndevelopment consistent with Indonesia\u2019s comparative advantage\nand competitive edge; this will help revive economic growth. A\ndynamic  SME  sector  will  generate  employment  and  reduce\npoverty. The resulting impetus to structural change is expected\nto lead to a reduction of the concentrated structure of industry in\nIndonesia with concomitant benefits in terms of a more even size\ndistribution of firms and market power, and increased consumer\nwelfare. The reforms will improve governance by reducing the\nopportunities for rent seeking and corruption.\nClassification Economic Growth\nEnvironmental Category C. The  environmental  implications of  the  Program\nAssessment: are minimal.\nThe ADB Loan\nLoan Amount It  is    proposed    that    ADB  support  the  Government\u2019s  policy\nand Terms reform program by providing a loan of $200 million.1 The loan will\nbe  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  with  interest\ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  pool-based  variable\nlending  rate  system  for  US  dollar  loans  and  a  commitment\ncharge of 0.75 percent per annum in accordance with ADB\u2019s\nstandard procedure. A front-end fee will be payable in an amount\nequal to 1 percent of the loan. The loan will have an amortization\nperiod of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years.\nProgram Period The program period will be two years. The loan will be released\n            and Tranching in two equal tranches. The first tranche ($100 million) will be\nmade available upon loan effectiveness. The second tranche will\nconsist of an incentive subtranche and a final subtranche, of\nequal amounts ($50 million each), to be released in December\n2000  and  September  2001,  subject  to  satisfactory\nimplementation of the agreed conditions.\nExecuting Ministry of Finance\nAgency\n                                                          \n1 The possibilities of loan cofinancing have been pursued in conjunction with the ADB loan from the beginning of\nprogram processing. Potential loan cofinanciers include, among others, Japan Bank for International Cooperation.", "iv\nProcurement and The  loan  proceeds  will  be  utilized  to   finance   the  full\nDisbursement foreignexchange  costs  (excluding  local  duties  and  taxes)  of\nimports procured in and from ADB member countries, other than\nthose specified in the list of ineligible items and those items\nfinanced by other multilateral and bilateral official sources. All\nprocurement under the loan will be undertaken through normal\ncommercial practices for the private sector or the Government\u2019s\nprescribed procurement procedures acceptable to ADB, with due\nconsideration  to  economy  and  efficiency.  The  Borrower  will\ncertify that the volume of eligible imports exceeds the amount of\nthe  projected  disbursements  under  the  ADB  loan  in  a  given\nperiod. ADB will have the right to audit the use of loan proceeds\nand to verify the accuracy of the Borrower\u2019s certification.\nCounterpart The counterpart  funds  to  be generated  from  the loan proceeds\nFunds will be used to finance the cost of structural adjustment and\nactivities consistent with the Program.\nTechnical Assistance\nPromoting The advisory TA of $1.5 million will support a deregulation and\nDeregulation and competition  task  force  that  will  help  the  Commission  for\nCompetition Competition Supervision simplify the policy framework, promote\ncompetition policy according to best practice, and to develop\ncapacity to review commercial laws and regulations that impede\ncompetition,  with  a  view  to  eliminating  those  that  cannot  be\njustified in terms of net public benefits. The TA will be financed\non a grant basis from the Asian Currency Crisis Support Facility\n(ACCSF), funded by the Government of Japan. It is estimated\nthat about 30 person-months of international consulting services\nand 30 person-months of domestic consulting services will be\nrequired.  All  consultants  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with\nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other\narrangements satisfactory to ADB for recruitment of domestic\nconsultants.\n Small and Medium The advisory TA of $2 million will help the SME Task Force\nEnterprise evaluate existing support programs and develop a strategy for\nDevelopment SME development. The SME policy framework should focus on\nrationalizing the institutional mandate for SME policy formulation\nand implementation, and the provision of business and financial\nsupport in accordance with international best practice. The TA\nwill be financed on a grant basis from the ACCSF, funded by the\nGovernment  of  Japan.  It  is  estimated  that  about  40  person-\nmonths  of  international  consulting  services  and  50  person-\nmonths  of  domestic  consulting  services  will  be  required.  All\nconsultants  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements\nsatisfactory to ADB for recruitment of domestic consultants.", "v\nRisks and The key concern is the adverse transitional consequences of the\nSafeguards adjustment  program  such  as  labor  retrenchment,  subsidy\nreductions, and higher user fees, which could provoke resistance\nfrom affected groups, slow the pace of reforms, and jeopardize\ntheir sustainability. This risk is mitigated by the Government\u2019s\nstrong commitment to the reform agenda and its efforts to reach\nconsensus, as well as by the provision of financial support by the\ninternational  community.  While  the  program  aims  to  remove\npolicy inefficiencies, the counterpart funds from the program will\nhelp finance the provision of safety nets for groups most hard-\npressed by the economic crisis. The risk of policy reversals is\nfurther mitigated by governance reforms that strengthen the role\nof independent agencies such as BI, and the Commission for\nCompetition  Supervision.  Finally,  measures  taken  to  reduce\neconomic  rent  seeking  are  expected  to  strengthen  public\nconfidence in the reform program.\nA  second  risk  is  the  possibility  that  measures  to  rationalize\nsubsidized credit policies will be misconceived as reductions in\ncredit and support for vulnerable sectors. This risk is mitigated by\nthe  Program  and  associated  TA,  which  call  for  public\nconsultation and the participation of SMEs in the formulation of\nmore effective policies to promote the sector and meet its needs\nfor business services, credit, and capacity building.\nA third risk is that bank and corporate restructuring will proceed\nat a slow pace. This would mean that fewer firms would be able\nto take advantage of the opportunities to reposition themselves\nprovided by the improving industrial policy environment. This risk\nis  mitigated  by  the  Government\u2019s  recent  adoption  of  an\nenhanced  strategy  for  restructuring  and  by  the  substantial\nassistance being provided by the International Monetary Fund,\nADB, World Bank, and bilateral funding agencies for bank and\ncorporate restructuring.\n ", "I.  THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on (i) a proposed\nloan to the Republic of Indonesia for the Industrial Competitiveness and Small and Medium\nEnterprise Development Program and (ii) two technical assistance (TA) grants for (a) Promoting\nDeregulation and Competition, and (b)  Small and Medium Enterprise Development.\nII.  INTRODUCTION\n2. During the 1970s and 1980s, economic growth in Indonesia was led by the oil and mineral\nindustry sectors that thrived in the inward-oriented and import substitution policy regime. Oil\nrevenues helped speed up industrialization through extensive public investment in upstream and\ncapital intensive industries. Following the collapse of oil prices in the world market, Indonesia\nfaced  balance  of  payment  difficulties  that  underscored  the  urgency  to  reorient  its  industrial\nstrategy to achieve greater diversification toward the non-oil sector. Starting in the mid-1980s,\nIndonesia repositioned itself to adopt an export-oriented industrial strategy with emphasis on non-\noil industries and private sector participation. The main elements of the industrial reform packages\nadopted from the mid-1980s to 1993 were a greater openness to private sector and foreign\ninvestment  (although  entry  prohibitions  remained  in  selective  areas),  and  across-the-board\nreductions in nominal tariffs. These reforms were complemented by a limited reorganization of\ncustoms, ports, and shipping operations. These liberalization efforts spurred more than a decade\nof rapid economic growth based on high rates of industrial growth, much of it in export-oriented\nindustries. Economic growth contributed to a significant decline in poverty between 1976 and\n1996.\n3. Despite  considerable  structural  transformation,  significant  industrial  policy  distortions\nremained or emerged. These included (i)  wide prevalence of government-sanctioned monopolies\n(such as Agency for National Logistics [BULOG]) and cartel arrangements, entry restrictions on\n\u201csensitive\u201d  or  \u201cstrategic\u201d  subsectors  (plywood,  cement,  fertilizer,  sugar  processing,  aircraft\nmanufacturing, steel); (ii) protection, on an ad hoc basis, for selected sectors and products; and\n(iii) distribution controls.\n4. These distortions diverted significant resources to industries that were not competitive;\nencouraged rent seeking; promoted concentration in industrial structure; and raised business\ncosts, official and unofficial, associated with the complex regulations, approvals, and licenses still\nrequired by many types of commercial activity. The impediments to resource allocation resulted in\nslower  growth  rates  by  the  mid-1990s,  and  reduced  competitiveness  relative  to  other  high-\nperforming economies in Asia. These developments took place when Indonesia was becoming\nmore integrated into the international economy and facing increased competition; together they\ncontributed to increasing the country\u2019s vulnerability to external shocks.\n5. The  economic  crisis  has  revealed  the  underlying  weaknesses  of  the  industry  sector\nthrough the unprecedented contraction in manufacturing, which had been the engine of growth.\nThe magnitude of the impact of the crisis on the sector resulted from three major factors:\n(i)  the Indonesian rupiah depreciated to record lows; firms that had high exposure to\nshort-term foreign debt faced insolvency given their inability to service debt and\nraise fresh liquidity to resume operations;\n(ii)  legal and other constraints impeded the restructuring of the corporate sector and\nthe ability of firms to settle debt obligations and resume production activity; and\n(iii) the remaining distortions in industrial and trade policies reduced competitiveness\nand  prevented the rapid reallocation of resources required to recover from the\ncrisis.", "2\n6. Indonesia responded to the economic crisis by adopting a macroeconomic stabilization\nprogram and wide-ranging structural reforms supported by International Monetary Fund (IMF),\nWorld Bank, and Asian Development Bank (ADB). A major component of the reforms is bank\nrestructuring and recapitalization assisted by ADB,1 as well as corporate restructuring. The initial\nround  of  industry  sector  reforms  addressed  longstanding  anticompetitive  policy  distortions\nincluding elimination of (i) fiscal subsidies for the aircraft industry; (ii) tax exemptions for the\nNational Car Program; (iii) restraints to interprovincial trade, and (iv) entry restraints, local content\nrequirements,  or administered  prices in  several  subsectors  including  the  sawmilling  and  the\nlogging industry. With a view to ensuring a consistent and systematic approach to industrial\npolicy, and supporting the overall restructuring efforts, the Government, with ADB assistance, has\nformulated  a  comprehensive  industrial  deregulation  and  liberalization  program  to  dismantle\nremaining distortionary policies.\n7. ADB provided TA for the formulation of a consistent industry and trade sector strategy.2\nThe TA examined, in depth, the industrial structure, policy, regulatory, and institutional issues.\nWithin this context, a review was conducted of the commercial legal environment, tariffs and\nnontariff barriers, domestic trade and distribution constraints, investment laws and regulations,\ncustoms administration and trade facilitation, and export incentives and promotion. The TA also\nanalyzed distortions and constraints to private enterprises including small and medium enterprises\n(SMEs). Based on this economic and sector work, since 1997 ADB has pursued an active policy\ndialogue with the Government and other funding agencies to promote a competitive, transparent\nand predictable policy environment that provides a level playing field for all enterprises.\n8. In 1998 ADB fielded reconnaissance missions in April and July, and the Fact-Finding\nMission in September to reach an understanding with the Government on the objectives, scope,\nand pace of the industrial and trade policy reforms under the Program. The Appraisal Mission3\nwas fielded in March 1999 to firm up understandings reached on the policy actions as enunciated\nin the Development Policy Letter and attached Policy Matrix (Appendix 1). It was followed by\npolicy consultation missions in May and July 1999. With the resumption of the policy dialogue\nfollowing the election of a new government, a Technical and a Policy Consultation Mission were\nfielded in November and December 1999 to reach final understandings. The program framework\nand its monitoring arrangements are given in Appendix 2.\nIII. THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT\nA.  Government Strategy and Policies\n9. The  democratic  political  transition  in  Indonesia  has  given  it  a  historic  opportunity  to\nreinforce and consolidate its reform efforts, accelerate economic recovery and improve the well\nbeing of its people. While focusing on economic recovery and job creation as key tasks, the new\ngovernment has reconfirmed its commitment against corruption, collusion and nepotism. These\nobjectives will need to be achieved under tighter budgetary constraints due to the ongoing cost of\nthe financial crisis. Driven by political and economic imperatives, there is thus a need for a policy\nagenda that is cost efficient and effective.\n10. The tremendous political changes in Indonesia have been caused by, and have increased,\nthe growing power of civil society. This has manifested itself in the form of newly empowered\nlobby groups and organizations, and generally greater freedom of expression. The immediate\n                  \n1 Loans 1618/1619/1620-INO: Financial Governance Reforms: Sector Development Program, for $1,497 million, approved\non 25 June 1998.\n2 TA 2705-INO: Trade and Industry Planning and Strategy Formulation for Repelita VII, for $860,000, approved on\n12 December 1996. A supplementary increase of $140,000 was approved on 22 December 1998.\n3 The Mission consisted of J. Ahmed, Senior Economist, Mission Leader; X. Yao, Senior Programs Officer; Y. Qian, Project\nEconomist; Y. Elhan, Economist; and P. Van Diermen, consultant.", "3\nresult has been a demand by the people for a much more accountable and effective government.\nResponding to these demands, Indonesia\u2019s democratically elected Parliament has adopted State\nPolicy Guidelines that define an agenda for reviving the economy and laying the foundation for a\nsustained  recovery  that  will  reduce  poverty  and  provide  opportunity  to  all.  Based  on  these\nguidelines, the Government has adopted a comprehensive economic reform program supported\nby IMF, World Bank, and ADB that will accelerate the restructuring of the Indonesian economy.\n11. The  Government\u2019s  economic  stabilization  program  is  complemented  by  wide-ranging\nstructural reforms to (i) adopt an expansionary fiscal policy, (ii) improve monetary management to\nbe steered by an independent Bank Indonesia (BI), (iii) increase the efficiency and transparency\nof public sector activities, (iv) restructure banks and corporates, (v) preserve productive assets\nand ease pressure on the exchange rate, (vi) improve governance at public sector and corporate\nlevels, and (vii) strengthen social protection and shield the poor and other vulnerable groups.\n12. Key emphasis has been placed on implementing banking reforms. At the same time, debt\nrestructuring  of  large  firms  is  underway  to  support  bank  restructuring.  The  Indonesia  Bank\nRestructuring Agency (IBRA) was set up and entrusted with legal powers to deal with the debt\nresolution. The portfolio of nonperforming banks was transferred to IBRA, which closed a number\nof banks. Of the 160 private banks in 1997, 66 were closed, 12 taken over by the Government,\nand 8 jointly recapitalized with their owners. The Government has issued bonds to recapitalize\nbanks that have potential to survive. The total cost of recapitalization is expected to be about\n$89 billion, or 60 percent of GDP. Of the state banks, four were merged into an entity called Bank\nMandiri, which is undergoing restructuring. Robust measures were taken following the discovery\nof the Bank Bali scandal. To restore market confidence the Bank Bali investigation is being\nadvanced,  and  systems  and  procedures  to  prevent  recurrence  are  being  strengthened;  the\nattorney  general  has  made  one  indictment  and  additional  actions  are  forthcoming  as  the\ninvestigation proceeds.\n13. The Frankfurt Agreement of June 1998 paved the way for establishing the Indonesian\nDebt Restructuring Agency, which provides foreign exchange cover for interest and amortization\npayments on restructured debt. While IBRA has taken charge of nonperforming loans and is\norganizing debt workouts, the Jakarta Initiative was launched for voluntary bilateral negotiations to\nfacilitate  settlement  of  corporate  debt  outside  the  judicial  system.  Although  the  institutional\nframework was well conceived, implementation fell short of expectations. This was partly the\nresult of administrative bottlenecks, and the absence of explicit incentives to encourage creditors\nand  debtors  to  negotiate  restructuring  deals  speedily  and  to  accept  the  losses  implicit  in\nrestructuring. In view of the limited progress achieved by mid-1999,4 fresh momentum has now\nbeen given to corporate restructuring by empowering IBRA to take over assets of recalcitrant\ndebtors and by establishing a procedure by which the Government can direct cases to the Jakarta\nInitiative Task Force. The Government is also considering other measures including referral to the\nattorney general for the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings against firms that refuse to negotiate\nin good faith under the mediation procedures of the Jakarta Initiative. ADB support for the Jakarta\nInitiative includes the provision of $1 million to finance expert services to facilitate restructuring of\nSMEs.5 Restructuring and privatization of State-owned enterprises is an integral part of these\ncorporate sector reforms.\n14.   These  efforts  are  being  supplemented  by  improvements  to  the  governance  of  key\neconomic institutions essential to achieve and maintain the soundness of the financial sector and\nsupport restructuring efforts. A new Central Bank Law has been enacted establishing BI as an\n                  \n4  280 Indonesian companies with a total outstanding debt of $23.2 billion (external) and Rp14.6 trillion (domestic) entered\ninto debt negotiations under this framework, only 24 cases covering a total amount of $3.04 billion and Rp2.2 million were\nsuccessfully negotiated.\n5 Under TA Loan 1620-INO: Capacity Building for Financial Governance, for $50 million, approved on 25 June 1998 as part\nof Financial Governance Reforms: Sector Development Program  (see footnote 1).", "4\nindependent  central  bank.  BI  has  been  audited  and  the  results  submitted  to  Parliament  in\nDecember 1999.  BI has now adopted a time-bound plan to address the issues raised by the audit\nand has approved a strategy for strengthening bank supervision. A master plan is also being\ndeveloped for the oversight of the nonbank financial sector by the Ministry of Finance.\n15. To complement the corporate restructuring process, the Government initiated a review of\nindustrial  and  trade  policies  to  identify  obstacles  and  distortions  and  improve  the  incentive\nframework,  promote  competition,  and  enhance  the  transparency  and  predictability  of  policy\nmaking. Steps have been taken to reform trade policies, open up sectors to competition and\nforeign investment, dismantle monopolies, and establish the legal and regulatory framework for\ncompetition. A strategic concern is to revitalize SMEs, whose development has been constrained\nin the past due to various policy and regulatory biases. This concern is underscored by the SME\nsector\u2019s high potential for labor absorption and income generation which will be key mechanisms\nfor restoring growth and reducing poverty. The trade and industry reforms aimed at strengthening\ncompetition and market orientation will pave the way for further corporate restructuring and\nimprove the efficiency of the Indonesian economy in the coming years.\nB. Recent Performance and Prospects\n16. As  a  result  of  the  Government\u2019s  considerable  flexibility  and  prudence  in  economic\nmanagement,  Indonesia  is  emerging  from  the  worst  of  what  has  been  an  unprecedented\neconomic crisis. This is reflected in an across-the-board recovery which according to preliminary\nestimates has resulted in a growth rate of gross domestic product (GDP) of about 0.3 percent in\n1999.  This  contrasts  with  the  contraction  of  real  GDP  of  13.2  percent  in  1998.6  Prudent\nmacroeconomic  management,  tight  domestic  liquidity  conditions,  and  gradual  restoration  of\nconfidence in the rupiah has stabilized the exchange rate, which is presently at about Rp7,500 to\nthe dollar.  A major accomplishment was the reining in of inflation, with the annual rate in 1999\nprojected at 2 percent. This is much lower than the forecast 25 percent earlier in the year. This\ndeceleration is significant, as inflation peaked at around 78 percent in June 1998. Tight monetary\npolicy and the agriculture sector\u2019s recovery following the El Ni\u00f1o episode of 1997-1998, helped\nreduce inflation. As inflationary expectations subsided, the benchmark interest rate on one-month\nTreasury bills has steadily declined, from a peak of 70 percent in August 1998 to about 13 percent\nat present. A commensurate decline in bank deposit rates (with virtually unchanged lending rates)\nhas eliminated negative intermediation spreads for most banks.\n17. While rising oil prices boosted non-oil export revenues, overall export revenues declined\nby about 7 percent in 1999. However, the weak overall export revenue performance masks more\nrobust export volume growth but this was mitigated by lower international prices for both natural\nresource and manufactured exports. Manufactured exports are constrained by lack of access to\nbank finance which will require speedier bank restructuring. Import compression declined with\nimports falling about 11 percent in 1999, in contrast to a fall of 30 percent in 1998. Capital goods\nimports lagged in 1999, reflecting the fall in investment demand. However, intermediate imports,\ncrucial for sustaining recovery of exports and growth, stabilized in mid-year and grew by 5 percent\nin 1999. To strengthen export performance, the Government is pursuing trade liberalization and\nhas set up the Bank Export Indonesia as a one-stop shop to handle trade financing.\n18. Investment activity continues to be depressed. As output and incomes remain low, to\noffset the low level of private investment and stimulate aggregate demand, the Government has\npursued an expansionary fiscal policy. The budget deficit for FY 1999/2000 is projected to rise to\n4.3 percent  of  GDP  to  support  an  expansion  in  public  expenditures.  The  growing  costs  of\n                  \n6 For the first time in 30 years non-oil manufacturing experienced negative growth, declining by 12 percent during 1998.\nWhile non-oil manufacturing grew only 1.9 percent in 1999, there was a strong and encouraging recovery in the final\nquarter of the year.", "5\nrecapitalization of banks and provision of social safety nets to vulnerable groups are significant\ncontributors to this deficit.\n19. Among the various social safety net programs for poor and vulnerable groups was the\nprovision of subsidized supply of rice to the poor that reached 10 million families by the end of\nOctober 1998.  A further Rp2.7 trillion has been allocated in the budget for FY 1999/2000 for this\nprogram.  In  addition,  significant  allocations  have  been  made  for  poverty  alleviation,  health,\nspecific  employment  programs,  including  to  enhance  women\u2019s  employment,  and  to  local\ngovernments  to  launch  regional  development  programs.  These  programs  have  enhanced\nmonitoring  provisions  and  other  safeguards  to  prevent  abuse  and  protect  implementation,\nincluding frequent reporting on key performance indicators, independent verification, and close\ninvolvement by civil society. ADB has provided extensive assistance to help mitigate the social\nimpact of the crisis (see paras. 69 and 70).\n20. Overall,  recent  developments  provide  grounds  for  renewed  optimism.  Prospects  for\nmacroeconomic stability are encouraging given the reduction of inflation and the stabilization of\nthe rupiah. Financial and real sectors have benefited from the fall in interest rates to below pre-\ncrisis  levels,  as  indicated  by  the  evident  resumption  of  GDP  growth.  Based  on  these\ndevelopments, for 2000, GDP growth is expected to accelerate to about 3 to 4 percent. However,\nthe economic recovery is fragile and macroeconomic stability is vulnerable to swings in market\nsentiment. The recent buildup in foreign exchange reserves resulting from rising oil revenues\nprovides  an  important,  if  limited,  cushion  to  absorb  such  swings.  This  will  need  to  be\nsupplemented,  and  the  recent  economic  gains  consolidated,  through  continued  stress  on\nacceleration of structural adjustment reforms.\nIV. THE SECTOR\nA.  Background and Recent Performance\n1. Industrial Growth and Structural Transformation\n21. Indonesia\u2019s  industrial  strategy  has  undergone  significant  changes  over  the  years.\nEmphasis on import substitution up to 1983 and large-scale public sector involvement in industry\nled  to  the  development  of  costly  capital-intensive  industries.  Between  1976  and  1983,\nmanufacturing value added grew at an average of 10 percent per annum, largely because of high\ncapital intensity rather than efficiency in its use.7\n22.   Subsequently, the export-oriented industrial strategy pursued from the mid-1980s to the\nmid-1990s focused on significant reductions in international trade barriers, and encouraged more\nfriendly policies toward foreign direct investment (FDI). Fostering greater efficiency in markets,\nthese  policies  led  to  growth  of  export-oriented  industries  (including  garments,  textiles,  and\nfootwear), food processing, and construction. Following the shift in industrial strategy from import\nsubstitution to export orientation, manufacturing value added growth rose to 16 percent per\nannum between 1984 and 1993. The total factor productivity contribution to growth rose to\n33 percent, with the rest of the growth attributable to increments in capital and labor. Despite\nthese improvements, the level of productivity and efficiency of Indonesian industry compares\nunfavorably with other high-performance Asian economies where total factor productivity growth\naccounts  for  about  50  percent  of  increases  in  manufacturing  productivity.  Given  resource\nconstraints, large increments in labor and capital inputs are no longer sustainable. Productivity\n                  \n7  Productivity increases are the result of increased use of factor inputs such as labor and capital, and improved total factor\nproductivity (TFP) from more efficient use of these inputs through their reallocation to more productive sectors. The\ncontribution of TFP to the growth rate during 1976-83 was barely 8 percent, while increments in capital stock contributed\n73 percent. Despite the growth in inputs, inappropriate policies for resource allocation offset the contributions of input to\noutput growth.", "6\ngains will have to come from resource shifts into more productive activities induced by a higher\ndegree of domestic and international competition.\n23. Over the same period, key structural changes occurred in the economy: (i) the non-oil\nindustry\u2019s value added share in GDP increased from 16 percent to 23 percent, (ii) agriculture\u2019s\nshare declined from 22 percent to 19 percent, and (iii) the service sector\u2019s fell from 12 percent to\n7 percent. Within the manufacturing sector, the share of the oil and gas sector declined from\n17 percent to 11 percent. With a decline in oil refining, the share of non-oil/gas in manufacturing\nvalue added increased from 83 percent to 89 percent. The rapid economic growth benefited\nIndonesian workers whose wage employment and average real wages grew at an average rate of\n6 percent and 10 percent per annum, respectively. Growth and industrial transformation also\nbenefited  SMEs  whose  employment  and  income  generation  capacity  and  contribution  to\nproduction of low cost goods and services are significant in the Indonesian economy. The policy\nbias  towards  large  scale  industry  persisted,  however,  and  was  reflected  in  an  industrial\nconcentration level higher than most regional competitors.\n 24. Subsequently, economic performance began to slow down by the mid-1990s; this was\nreflected in a decline in manufacturing employment growth and the GDP growth rate. Factors\nbehind  this  slowdown  were  the  rapid  real  effective  appreciation  of  the  rupiah,  a  continuing\nantiexport bias in the trade policy regime, and the prevalence of numerous restraints to domestic\ntrade and competition. With the crisis, economic progress ceased altogether with output and\nemployment  declining  across  all  industry  subsectors.  The  capacity  utilization  rates  in  the\nchemical, electronics, textile, garment, and food processing subsectors fell from an average of\nabout 80 percent in 1996 to about 50 percent in the last quarter of 1998. The severity of the\nimpact of the crisis varied depending on firm size, market, and location. Foreign-owned and large\nfirms, firms operating in the outer islands and medium-scale exporters, as well as producers of\nresource-based products, report smaller declines in capacity utilization relative to smaller and\nnonexporting firms.8 While access to credit was an issue for many firms, some exporting firms\nhave been able to obtain financing from their foreign affiliates and from their suppliers.  For all\nfirms, the major cause of disruption was the decline in aggregate demand.\n2. Size distribution of firms9 and Interfirm Linkages\n25. Indonesia\u2019s corporate sector is characterized by a small number of relatively large export-\noriented firms and large domestic-oriented firms. In 1996, the formal industry sector included\nabout 7,000 large firms, 6,000 medium firms, and 229,000 small firms. The large firms contributed\n85 percent of manufacturing value added, and small, medium and cottage enterprises\u20135 percent\neach. Relative to regional economies, Indonesia has not as yet fully exploited the potential of the\nSME  sector,  although  small  enterprises  have  performed  relatively  well  in  terms  of  creating\nemployment. The contribution to value added of medium enterprises, however, declined to a low\nof 5 percent in 1996 from a high of 14 percent in 1975.\n26. Between 1975 and 1996 the share of large firms in manufacturing employment increased\nfrom  13  percent  to  35  percent;  the  share  of  small  enterprises  increased  from  7  percent  to\n19 percent; and the share of cottage enterprises declined from 75 percent to 40 percent. What is\nunusual by international experience is the initial increase of the share of medium enterprises from\n5 percent in 1975 to 9 percent in 1986, followed by a decline to 6 percent in 1996.\n                  \n8 See Widianto, B. and Choesni, A.  1999. Asian Corporate Recovery. BAPPENAS, Jakarta.\n9 Internationally, there is no clear definition of what constitutes large, medium, or small enterprises. Indonesia has recently\nadopted a definition that is based on size of assets. For analytical purposes, and for ease of data, this report uses the\nclassification by the Central Bureau of Statistics of firms by number of employees. Cottage establishments employ 1-\n4 persons, small establishments 5-19 persons, medium 20-99 persons, and large 100 persons or more.", "7\n27. The relative underdevelopment of SMEs in Indonesia reflects structural characteristics of\nan economy at an early stage of economic development. In addition, however, the performance of\nlarge, medium and small firms has varied because of differences in credit access, potential to\nmitigate  market  conditions,  and  the  impact  of  a  complex  and  highly  regulated  business\nenvironment. Small family-oriented enterprises tend to fall outside the regulatory framework and\nescape most of the regulatory costs. In contrast, formal SMEs generally pay a large proportion of\ntheir income to meet regulatory costs both legal and illegal. Medium enterprises, using more\nmodern equipment and management systems, and yet too small to capture government benefits,\nare most affected by the regulatory framework.\n28. Despite low SME contribution to manufacturing value added, the sector provides a training\nground for entrepreneurs. Thus, about one fourth of the value added from large enterprises in\n1990 originated from firms that started as SMEs. The growth of SMEs and their graduation to a\nlarger size is thus a vital factor in industrial structural change leading to greater employment\nopportunities, increased competition, and a more even distribution of market power. Ensuring a\npolicy environment that continues to support the SME sector is essential to promote the structural\ntransformation of the industry sector.\n29. Relative  to  international  experience,  SMEs  in  Indonesia  are  underrepresented  as\nsubcontractors in the manufacture, service, and subassembly of components because the policy\nenvironment  tended  to  encourage  large-scale  vertically  integrated  operations.  These  policy\ndistortions  need  to  be  addressed  to  promote  more  efficient  resource  allocation  based  upon\ngreater SME participation. By developing interfirm linkages SMEs can provide assured and cost\neffective supply of manufactured components and other inputs to the industrial sector. Such\nsubcontracting is flourishing in textiles and garments. Besides these vertical linkages, horizontal\ninterfirm linkages are emerging as SMEs are finding it advantageous to locate in geographic\nclusters. These clusters are largely made up of small SMEs. While they make a substantial\ncontribution to employment, their contribution to value added is significantly smaller. Dynamic\nSME clusters are usually based on linkups with larger firms that provide access to markets and\ntechnologies that contribute to upgrading SME capability.\n3. Labor Standards\n30. Historically,  Indonesia\u2019s  labor  standards  have  been  supported  by  a  legal  framework\nadvocating a centralized enforcement system for mandatory standards, rather than allowing labor\nrepresentatives  to  self-regulate.  Prospects  for  collective  action  were  limited  because  of  the\nabsence of independent trade unions to provide the institutional support and information base for\nadequate labor representation and advocacy in disputes concerning labor standards. Without this\nright, workers were prevented from effectively participating in activities to monitor and regulate\ntheir working conditions. Until shortly prior to the crisis, there was only one legally recognized\nunion in the private sector, i.e., the Indonesia Workers Union.\n31. Greater public awareness of and desire to seek redress for work-related grievances has\nincreased  labor  actions  in  recent  years.  To  respond  to  this,  the  Ministry  of  Manpower  has\nattempted to play a more active role in enforcing mandated labor standards. Unlike in the past\nwhen labor unrest was prompted by dismissals, in the 1990s, labor action has been instigated\nmainly  by  deteriorating  wages  and  working  conditions.  Principal  issues  were  the  lack  of\nconfidence in the officially sanctioned union to negotiate better working conditions and wages, the\nweakness of dispute resolution mechanisms, and the limited independence of the bodies involved\nin the mediation process.\n32. Poor working conditions affect worker morale and increase costs. Recognizing that the key\nto ensuring humane and efficient working conditions and standards lies in allowing free collective\nbargaining, the Government has embarked on mandating improved standards and providing the", "8\nlegal basis for a greater role to be played by independent unions. In 1998, Indonesia signed a\nletter of intent with the International Labor Organization (ILO) for the ratification of the seven core\nILO conventions covering the four central issues of (i) freedom of association, (ii) forced labor,\n(iii) nondiscrimination, and (iv) child labor.10 As of June 1999, Indonesia is the only country in Asia\nto  have  ratified  all  seven  core  conventions.  The Tripartite  Task  Force  consisting  of  unions,\nGovernment, and employers was established and is working with ILO to implement the core\nstandards. With ILO\u2019s assistance, Indonesia is strengthening labor legislation by reviewing the\nManpower Act and preparing laws on trade unions and trade union disputes settlement. These\nwill aim to strike a balance between union monopoly and multiple unions and to include provision\nfor promoting the principle of \u201cmost representative organization\u201d under which a union with a\nmajority will have exclusive rights for collective bargaining. As a result of these efforts, trade\nunions now number 18. The legal and regulatory environment as well as actual implementation\nnow compares favorably with other economies in the region. In June 1999, Indonesia was cited by\nILO in recognition of labor standards improvements.\nB.  Constraints and Issues\n1. Inadequate Commercial Law and Competition Framework\n33. The efficiency of the corporate restructuring process and ensuing economic recovery are\nconstrained by weaknesses in the legal system. Chief among these are an inadequate bankruptcy\nlaw, the absence of a law on acquisitions and mergers, legal uncertainty over land titles and\nmovable securities, and a deficient contract law. Problems of transparency and corruption in the\nlegal system are other key impediments to the growth and development of efficient enterprises.\nThe increased sophistication of the Indonesian economy and the closer integration with world\nmarkets in the last decade have increased the urgency for implementing an effective commercial\nlegal system.\n34. Industrial performance and restructuring has been further affected by inadequacies of the\nlegal and institutional framework to sustain and promote a truly competitive economy. Therefore,\nthe enactment of a competition law is a cornerstone of industrial policy. Experience in other\ncountries shows that it is essential to focus such a law on market conduct rather than on a firm\u2019s\nmarket share. This implies preventing such anticompetitive practices as collusive (or horizontal)\nagreements to fix prices and market shares. Such practices should be per se illegal. It is also\nprudent to avoid legislating against certain non competitive practices that may increase consumer\nwelfare, such as joint ventures and various types of vertical restraints. These practices are better\naddressed by weighing their costs and benefits. Provisions related to this category of conduct\nneed to be grounded in economic analysis to ensure that rigid prohibitions are not automatically\nimposed. International best practice suggests that exemptions to the law need to be minimized\nand the law\u2019s coverage extended to State-owned-enterprises and other monopolies to ensure that\nliberalization measures are not impaired by their conduct. A dedicated enforcement agency in the\nform of a commission that is independent and has powers of investigation and legal sanction is\nrequired to effectively implement competition law.\n2. Anticompetitive Policies\n35. The industry sector is characterized by a wide range of restraints to domestic competition.\nThese include the cumbersome licensing system, entry and exit controls, regulated partnerships\nbetween firms of different sizes, public ownership of specific industries, informal levies, marketing\nrestrictions, price controls, and special assistance (subsidies and tax holidays) to specific firms\n                  \n10Child labor is infrequent in the industrial sector and  is a recognized problem in only a limited number of sub-sectors in the\neconomy (e.g., fisheries). Indonesia has adopted a minimum working age of 15 years, although as a developing economy\nit could have chosen a lower age in accordance with standards contained in the ILO core convention (convention C.138,\nadopted by the ILO in 1973). Further efforts are underway to identify and outlaw the most intolerable forms of child labor.", "9\nand industries. In addition to the entry barriers included in the Negative Investment List (para. 47),\nthere were restrictions to the participation of private firms in clove distribution, cement, paper and\nplywood, wholesaling and retailing, fertilizers, and oil products distribution. These restraints were\nlong-standing impediments to competitive markets and, except for those on oil products, have\nbeen removed under the Program.\n36. A typical example is the cement industry, in which regulatory arrangements were based on\na series of decrees governing the regional distribution of cement, both domestically and for\nexports, and including the setting of ex-factory and retail prices. These regulations protected\ninefficient  firms,  deterred  entry,  led  to  underinvestment  in  cement  production  capacity,  and\ndistorted regional investment decisions. The fertilizer industry operated in a subsidized, highly\nregulated, and administratively cumbersome environment with the objective of securing the supply\nof subsidized fertilizers to farmers. All five urea fertilizer producers in Indonesia are State owned.\nThe Government set ex-factory and farm-gate prices, provided direct and indirect subsidies to\nfertilizer producers, monopolized the distribution system, restricted imports, and set export quotas.\nThese pricing and marketing arrangements resulted in inefficient supply and consumption of urea\nfertilizer.\n37. Similarly, the importation and distribution of several oil products is controlled by the State-\nowned oil and gas company (Pertamina) and two closely affiliated companies. Their monopolies\ninclude solid and liquid lubricants, crude lubricant oil, ethylene, and propylene. Pertamina assigns\ndomestic distributors for these products. Industrial companies are allowed to import some of these\nproducts for their own use (i.e., under importer-producer licenses). These import and distribution\nrestrictions increase the cost of basic industrial raw materials used by producers in downstream\nindustries like plastics, textiles, and footwear. Pertamina also has a retail monopoly for gasoline.\nInternational experience indicates that a monopolistic market structure reduces the incentives for\nefficiency  improvements  in  the  retail  sector.  Opening  up  the  distribution  and  retail  gasoline\nsubsector to competition will improve efficiency and ensure competitive distribution margins. A\ndraft law is to be submitted to Parliament eliminating Pertamina\u2019s monopoly for transportation,\nstorage,  transmission,  and  marketing.  On  enactment  of  the  law,  private  companies  may\nparticipate in these activities after obtaining a business license. Exploration and exploitation will\nbe retained in the public sector, with private sector operations defined on the basis of contracts\nwith the Government.\n38. Restraints to competition in Indonesia have imposed costs through higher prices for basic\nraw materials as well as for final goods; reduced consumer and business choice; increased cross-\nsubsidies, which benefit inefficient firms at the cost of efficient firms; and reduced incentives for\ninnovation and efficiency. While under some circumstances unrestricted markets may fail, thus\njustifying policy interventions in the public interest, the onus of proof that competition is causing\nmore harm than good should be on the proponents of restrictions. In this context, the guiding\nprinciple for deregulation should be that legislation should not restrict competition. Temporary\nrestrictions are justifiable if their public benefits outweigh the costs. To strengthen competition,\nexisting  laws  and  regulations  must  be  reviewed,  and  institutional  mechanisms  developed  to\nevaluate public or net benefit and review legislation that impedes competition.\n3. International Trade Protection\n39. Indonesia, like some of its competitors in the region, significantly liberalized its trade\nregime prior to the economic crisis. The average unweighted tariff of 14 percent in 1997 was\nfurther reduced to 8.9 percent by September 1999. However, maximum tariffs are still high, with\nsome very high rates for automotive components and the alcohol industry.\n40. There are five major categories of nontariff barriers to international trade. The first is\nBULOG\u2019s import monopoly over wheat, wheat flour, sugar, garlic, soybeans and rice. These", "10\nitems, previously exempt, are now subject to multilateral negotiation. In 1998, the Government\neliminated importation and distribution monopolies of all BULOG items. However, rice and sugar\nimports  were  placed  under  temporary  licensing  requirements  with  a  view  to  achieving  price\nstabilization objectives for rice and orderly restructuring of the sugar industry. This policy was\nfurther liberalized in December 1999 by eliminating restrictive import licensing and replacing it\nwith temporary import tariffs on both commodities.\n41. The second category includes the National Car Policy adopted in 1996 according special\ntax and import privileges to enhance the local content of motor vehicles. This policy allowed Timor\nPutra, the domestic producer of cars and its joint venture partner, KIA Motors of the Republic of\nKorea, to be exempt from luxury sales tax and tariffs subject to their achieving 20 percent local\ncontent by the end of the first year, 40 percent by the end of the second year, and 60 percent by\nthe end of the third year. However, any manufacturer of commercial vehicles, vans, or sedan cars\nthat could reach the level of 60 percent of local content would also be exempted from the luxury\nsales tax and customs duties. The Government maintained this policy until the onset of the\neconomic crisis.\n42. The third category relates to local content requirements for dairy products.11\n43. The fourth category includes restrictions on the import of new and used ships. Since mid-\n1996, the shipbuilding industry in Indonesia has also been protected through a local content\nprogram, although notification of this was not given to the World Trade Organization. An earlier\nimport ban on ships (including fishing vessels), which reduced national efficiency and raised costs\nof inter-island shipping, was replaced in mid-1996 by an import licensing system, linked to a local\ncontent requirement. Buyers of vessels were obliged to purchase a certain number of locally built\nships for each imported vessel as part of the agreement for their receiving import licenses.\n44. The fifth category includes import licenses that apply to some 190 items (at the nine-digit\nlevel of the Harmonized System tariff code). Of these, some items require a license involving a\nsimple registration system for interested importers. The remaining restrictive licenses are used for\nimport control with the following categories: (i) dilarang (or controlled imports); (ii) AT (agen\ntunggal) or licenses for importation by sole agents; (iii) IT (importir terdaftar) or licenses granted\nfor specific imports, where an importer can only import under legal or government decree; and\n(iv) IP (importir produsen) or importer-producer licenses for the importation of inputs by firms for\ntheir own use in production. Within categories (i) and (ii) are many items for which licenses\u2014or\nsome other means of control\u2014are justified for security, social, moral, environmental, or safety\nreasons. These include explosives, insecticides, and herbicides. Outside of these items, the ITs\nand IPs are the principal source of nontariff barriers for a small number of food and beverage\nproducts (most of which were marketed through Government channels); motor vehicles; ships; oil;\nartificial sweeteners; hand tools; and iron and steel. In many cases, these licenses remain in\nplace  as  a  means  of  protecting  local  producers.  They  also  have  a  distinctly  anti-SME  bias\nbecause they prevent importers from selling such goods to other users. As a result, SMEs that\nfind it too costly to import these types of goods in commercial quantities are effectively limited to\npurchasing their inputs from local producers.\n4. High Regulatory and Licensing Costs\n45. Besides ad hoc protection and restraints to competition to favor certain industrial groups,\nGovernment  policy  interventions  expanded  the  system  of  licenses,  approvals,  and  permits\nrequired for most commercial functions. To establish a trading business, for example, a firm may\nneed as many as 46 licenses at various levels. Dealing with these administrative requirements\n                  \n11 Local content programs in the Uruguay Round Agreement are identified under the Agreement on Trade-Related\nInvestment Measures as being inconsistent with General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade Article III (national treatment)\nand must be eliminated, once notified. The Government is committed to removing such programs.", "11\nimposes high financial and opportunity costs in terms of the limited amount of time available to\nentrepreneurs. Larger firms have an advantage relative to smaller ones in that they can assign\nspecialist  staff  to  deal  with  the  regulatory  burden.  The  cost  of  obtaining  such  licenses  is\nconservatively estimated at 3 percent of the gross sales for large trading firms, and as much as\n5 percent for SMEs.12 Appendix 3 describes the complex process involved in obtaining a trading\nlicense.\n46. This costly licensing system has several negative implications for the economy. First, it is\na  major  factor  that  contributes  towards  the  \u201chigh-cost\u201d  economy.  This  in  turn  reduces\ncompetitiveness  of  firms,  especially  SMEs.  Second,  the  cumbersome  regulatory  procedures\nimpede firms\u2019 ability to quickly switch productive capacity to alternative commercial activities (e.g.,\nexporting their products) in response to changing market conditions. Third, those firms which\ncannot afford the high cost of formalizing their business activities choose to remain outside the\nformal sector. These are again primarily SMEs.\n5. Distortions in Investment Policy and Trade Facilitation\na. Investment Laws and Processes\n47. The collapse of investment during the crisis underscores the need for a policy response\nthat provides a stable and predictable policy regime that reduces uncertainty and promotes\ninvestor confidence. The restrictive legal and regulatory regime, entry barriers defined by the\nnegative list of industries and the lack of a level playing field and transparency in investment\npolicy framework are major impediments to reviving investment growth. In 1998, the Government\nrevised the negative investment list by publishing two lists (instead of one). Presidential Decree\nNo. 96/1998 specifies (i) 16 sectors closed to all types of investment, and (ii) 9 sectors closed to\nnew FDI, while Presidential Decree No. 99/1998 (i)  reserves 33 product groups for small firms,\nand (ii) opens 26 product groups to medium- and large-scale investors, but only in partnership\nwith small firms/cooperatives.\n48. Besides the need to remove investment restrictions, the legal framework needs to ensure\nconsistency with competitive trends and liberalization in other aspects of the Indonesian economy.\nIn particular, the discrepancy between the relatively restrictive basic laws and subsequent reform\ninitiatives has resulted in unnecessary confusion and lack of transparency regarding the policy\nframework  for  investment.13  The  existing  Foreign  Capital  Investment  Law  of  1967  and  the\nDomestic Capital Investment Law of 1968 need to be repealed and replaced with an investment\nlaw  that  establishes  a  transparent  framework  for  both  foreign  and  domestic  investors.  In\naccordance with best practice, the law should provide for more simplified and uniform treatment of\ninvestment  approvals,  whether  domestic  or  foreign;  improve  transparency;  and  reduce  the\nopportunities for corruption, collusion, and nepotism by reducing and rationalizing the provision of\nad hoc fiscal and other special incentives to investment. Effective implementation of the new legal\nand regulatory framework will require a significant reorientation of the Investment Board14 as its\nmandate shifts from regulating and controlling FDI to promoting and facilitating both FDI and\ndomestic  investment  under  the  new  framework.  In  addition,  the  Government  will  need  to\nstreamline departments that traditionally regulated investment and maintain various types of price,\nimport, and distribution controls.\n                  \n12 The Domestic Distribution System for Manufactured Goods: Supplying Competitive Industrial Growth. Report No. 16173.\nWorld Bank. 1996. Washington, D.C.\n13For example, the base laws provide approval for FDI for 30 years and require divestment to reduce the share of foreign\nownership. The procedures for renewing licenses and the scope of the investment requirement are not clearly or\ntransparently specified.\n14 The former Investment Coordinating Board [BKPM] was reconstituted in 1999 as the Investment Board of the Board of\nInvestment and State Owned Enterprises [BPM-PBUMN].", "12\nb. Distribution Policy\n49. Following the onset of the economic crisis, new implementing regulations for FDI which\nproved unusually restrictive, were introduced in April 1998:15\n(i)  Foreign retailers must be a large-scale retailer; this is defined as having capital of\nat least $100,000, excluding land and buildings. No minimum capital requirements\nare specified for wholesalers, although they must own a warehouse.\n(ii)  Foreign wholesalers and retailers are prohibited from operating in regions outside\nthe capital cities of DATI I and DATI II.16 This effectively prevents foreign firms from\noperating in many major urban centers outside the provincial capitals. One such\nexample is Bogor, a large city with a per capita income comparable to Jakarta.\n(iii)  Wholesalers and/or retailers must be part of a joint venture with a local Indonesian\npartner who must have at least 49 percent of total equity.\n(iv)  The local joint venture partners of foreign wholesalers and retailers operating in\nDATI II regions must be small-scale enterprises and/or cooperatives.\n50. These regulations curb the advantages of foreign entrants in the distribution system such\nas greater competition and lower distribution costs, improvements in the delivery of goods to end\nusers, and technology spillovers to local retailers. Under these regulations, investors are also\nfaced with the problem of finding suitable small enterprise partners. 17\nc. Trade Facilitation: Operation of Customs and Ports\n51. Prior to April 1997, responsibility for customs tariff classification and valuation for imports\nover $5,000 was essentially handled by a preshipment inspection company, Societe Generale de\nSurveillance (SGS). Examinations were performed by SGS in the country of export, and the\ninformation was transmitted to Indonesia to form the basis of payment. Customs procedures\nwithin Indonesia were restricted to the control of the remaining imports valued at less than $5,000.\n52. With the termination of SGS\u2019s contract in April 1997, the Government introduced new\nprocedures for clearing imported goods. Although the new procedures have achieved some\nsuccess,  their  implementation  has  been  jeopardized  by  several  factors,  including  (i)  lack  of\ncapacity to implement and manage the procedures, (ii) insufficient training of customs officers,\nand (iii) poor control of staff in the workplace.\n53. Although  the  transition  plan  included  the  necessary  features  of  modern  customs\nadministration, embodied in the new Customs Law that became effective on 1 April 1997, the new\nresponsibilities coupled with poor planning resulted in confusion and delays, and added a financial\nburden for importers who were not adequately notified of procedures. Importers faced delays and\ncosts not experienced under the previous preshipment inspection import regime. For example, a\nstatistical analysis of information on container dwell times at Tanjuk Priok (a major port for\ninternational shipping) shows that about 40 percent of containers had been in the port area for\nover 12 days, about 20 percent for 7 to 12 days, and the remaining 40 percent for 1 to 6 days. By\ninternational standards, this is excessive dwell time.\n54. These  factors  coupled  with  the  impact  of  corruption  on  international  trade  increase\nindustrial  costs.  Minor  adjustments  of  policies  and  procedures  within  Customs  and  the  port\nauthority  alone  will  not  achieve  significant  improvement,  given  the  weakness  of  these\n                  \n15 BKPM decrees 11/SK/1998 and 12/SK/1998.\n16DATI I refers to provincial capitals, and DATI II to regions outside of provincial capitals.\n17 Partly in recognition of these problems, in 1994 the Government effectively removed the joint venture requirement for\nforeign investors in the trading sector.", "13\norganizations in staff management and enforcing governance. A systematic approach is required\nthat combines efficient information technology in both Customs and the port authority with basic\nprocedural changes to the processing of imports, including the setting of monitorable performance\nstandards.\n6. Inefficient SME policies\na. Policy Framework, Regulatory Costs, and Coordination\n55. SME development is a Government priority to promote private-sector-led growth, generate\nemployment  and  incomes,  and  alleviate  poverty.  Reflecting  the  view  that  SMEs  were\ndisadvantaged by unregulated competition, past policies emphasized special measures to put\nthem on a level playing field with larger companies. The Government provided SMEs with a range\nof  incentives  and  concessions  including  subsidized  or  free  access  to  business  services,\nsubsidized credit, and mandated targets to commercial banks to lend to the sector (at market\ninterest rates). Paradoxically, this policy framework led to additional rules, regulations, licenses,\nand fees that have burdened SMEs.\n56. The increased efforts to support SMEs have resulted in significant coordination problems.\nA large number of Government departments and agencies are concerned with SMEs but few\nsystems are in place to coordinate efforts. There has been no systematic attempt to evaluate the\nvalue and impact of the various programs provided, as a result of which duplication and waste\noccur quite regularly. A related difficulty has been the sporadic and limited nature of consultation\nbetween policymakers, SMEs, and the organizations representing SMEs. This has meant that\npolicy  formulation  has  often  not  been  effectively  designed  to  respond  to  client  concerns.\nA renewed  effort  to  establish  robust  channels  for  consultation  and  feedback  between\npolicymakers, SMEs, and nongovernment organizations, and to develop a systematic approach to\nevaluating the success of SME support programs is an important objective of the Government\u2019s\nreform agenda.\nb. The Impact of the Crisis and Initial Mitigation Measures\n57. The dimensions of the economic crisis were revealed by a Government survey in mid-\n1998 indicating that of 175,903 SMEs surveyed across Indonesia, 75,453 (43 percent) had closed\ntheir business, 44,305 (25 percent) had experienced a decline in activity, and 31,127 (18 percent)\nhad  stopped  trading  but  had  not  yet  closed.  Of  the  nine  subsectors  covered  by  the  survey,\nhusbandry, mining, and manufacturing had fared the worst. Although subsequent surveys showed\nthat many SMEs were able to take advantage of new market opportunities,18 the extent of the\ninitial impact on SMEs led the Government to focus on subsidized financing to help SMEs\nweather the crisis. The principal SME credit programs have included:\n(i)  Credit for Small Enterprises, which requires that commercial banks allocate 22 \u2013\n25 percent of their portfolio to small borrowers at market rates for working capital\nand investment purposes;\n(ii)  the  provision  of  subsidized  credit  to  farm  cooperatives  and  SMEs  through\n16 schemes funded or managed by BI; and\n(iii)  Villages General Credit, a program intermediated by Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI)\nthat serves SMEs and microenterprises throughout the country at near-market\nrates.\n                  \n18The picture of SMEs in the wake of the economic crisis has not altogether been gloomy as some SMEs have actually\nthrived in these difficult times. For example, the export-oriented furniture industry in Jepara, Central Java, which largely\nconsists of SMEs that use locally sourced inputs and hence pay in rupiah but export their products and earn their revenue\nin foreign currency, has significantly increased.", "14\n58. Of these programs, the Credit for Small Enterprise scheme continues to be the largest with\nan outstanding portfolio of about Rp45 trillion, compared with Rp5 trillion for the Villages General\nCredit,  and  Rp22  trillion  for  all  liquidity  credit  schemes  funded  by  BI  (as  of  August  1999).\nNevertheless, the Credit for Small Enterprises scheme shows a 34 percent reduction in the\noutstanding portfolio relative to about Rp68 trillion in March 1998; this is indicative of the sharp\ndecline in new lending to the SME sector. The Villages General Credit scheme continued to\nfunction during the crisis, although with sharply reduced lending levels. The bulk of the recent\ncredit expansion has been to support food crop production in view of the need to mitigate the\ndepletion of farm savings following two years of drought and the weakening credit provision to\nagriculture from commercial sources affected by the economic crisis. In this connection, the\nGovernment increased the provision of subsidized credit under the BI-financed scheme, Kredit\nUsaha Tani (KUT), to help farmers and agricultural production. Lending for KUT increased from\nRp400 billion in June 1998 to Rp4.2 trillion in March 1999 to about 8.5 trillion by December 1999,\nwhile interest rates were reduced from 14 percent to 10.5 percent. In addition, the Government\nguarantee for the scheme was increased from 65 percent to 100 percent, effectively ensuring that\nbanks carry no risks and just administer the scheme.\nc. Shortcomings of  SME Credit Programs\n59. The substantial ad hoc growth in the number of subsidized credit schemes and credit flows\nafter the economic crisis is a major departure from the previous policy that (i) emphasized delivery\nof SME credit at market-determined interest rates and (ii) advocated a reduction in BI\u2019s liquidity\nsupport for SMEs, restricting this for credit requirements of food security operations. This SME\ncredit program and its recent growth raises several concerns:\n(i)  BI\u2019s liquidity support for special schemes has adverse monetary policy implications\nand is inconsistent with its role as an independent central bank.\n(ii)  The subsidies associated with these schemes are high and unsustainable in the\nlong-run, for example, the fiscal costs of the interest subsidy alone, excluding\nprovisioning, were close to Rp4 trillion for fiscal year 1999.\n(iii)  Access to large volumes of subsidized credit poses the risk of reducing demand for\ncommercially available sources of finance.\n(iv)  The subsidized credit often is delivered without adequate risk assessment and\nsince it is difficult to target the poor it often results in large-scale leakages and\nnonrepayment.19\n(v)  Mandatory credit programs that require banks to lend 22 to 25 percent of loans\nrepresent a tax on banks and add additional costs as banks failing to meet these\ntarget  are  subject  to  penalties.  In  the  short  term,  there  is  a  strong  case  for\neliminating noncompliance penalties, while over the long term, mandatory credit\nprograms should be eliminated as many banks lack the extensive regional branch\nnetworks or the knowledge and organizational structure that are necessary for\nlending to SMEs.\n(vi)  SMEs are relatively underserved by alternative financial institutions. The exception\nis a state-owned venture capital firm, Bahana Artha Ventura, but its capabilities\nvary across the country and its operations are not transparent. Basic financial\nservices such as leasing or factoring are not readily available to SMEs. A further\nset of constraints relates to the absence of effective institutions for the provision of\nmarketing and trading services.\n60. While  past  liabilities  of  SME  credit  programs  carry  a  high  fiscal  burden,  the  cost  of\nmaintaining new flows of subsidized credit has declined with the fall in overall interest rates to\n                  \n19 Evidence confirms that the repayment of KUT-credit prior to the crisis has been poor. To allow defaulters to borrow under\nthe KUT scheme, the Government wrote-off their accumulated nonperforming loans for 1985-1995 period and then\nextended the repayment period for arrears.", "15\nsingle digit levels in 1999. However, these schemes (in particular, KUT the largest scheme) are\ncostly to administer. With the strong recovery of agriculture, the justification for maintaining the\nsubsidized credit programs for this sector has weakened. Among other factors, it perpetuates\nleakages and corruption, and diverts credit from the industry sector\u2014credit flows to industry have\neffectively dried up.\nd. Technical and Business Capacity Building\n61. The Government has set up technical service centers and small industrial estates to\nprovide direct assistance to develop SME managerial and technological capabilities and improve\ntheir access to markets. These programs have had a mixed impact, being effective when services\nhave been directed to overcoming specific market failures, but in other cases the resources\ninvested in the services were dissipated given the range of services provided, the nationwide\naudience, and the limited funding. The combination of being free to the client and the enormous\nsize of the target has resulted in a pattern of one-shot services to small firms, with little possibility\nof providing follow-up. Most of the programs do not have a clear budget, and staff find it difficult to\nimplement concrete projects even when they are able to identify them. Over the years, most\ndepartments have been able to secure some foreign funding for specific programs that allowed for\nmore than one-shot interventions and brief training courses. Such foreign assistance-sponsored\ninterventions have been the exception and are expensive. The tendency to centralize has reduced\nflexibility, an essential ingredient in technical support programs. Where such support has been\nrelatively successful, it has been based on the engagement of private sector service providers\nwho have been subject to monitoring and evaluation by the appropriate Government agencies.\n62. Technical  support  programs  have  promoted  horizontal  linkages  between  SMEs  by\nsupporting joint action by clusters of small-scale entrepreneurs. These are designed to stimulate\nproduct and process innovations needed to help SMEs adjust to structural change. The programs\nconsist of courses provided by extension workers and the introduction of new equipment to\ndemonstrate the advantages of technological change to the producers. The program budget is\nlimited, and like the other forms of assistance, it is nonrecurring. Extension officers generally have\nlittle technical or business experience, and training or other technical facilities have been largely\nprovided according to the direction of central planners, rather than having been adapted to local\nneeds. Vertical linkages between small and large firms have been promoted through mandatory\npartnership programs. These programs have also had limited success in fostering viable business\npartnerships between SMEs and large firms. There is a need for an alternative approach that\nconcentrates on the creation of an enabling environment to stimulate the private sector to develop\ncloser alliances. \n7. Governance and Corruption\n63. Industry sector and SME financing policies and the lack of competition and transparency in\nthese policies have provided the public and private sectors with opportunities for rent seeking.\nThe principal policy instruments that have created such opportunities are quantitative restrictions,\nsubsidies, tariffs, and price controls. While tariffs and price controls have been substantially\nrationalized,  rent-seeking  opportunities  remain  due  to  nontariff  barriers  and  the  large-scale\nexpansion of subsidized KUT financing provided to farmers without due credit risk assessments.\nIn addition, low wages and poor incentive mechanisms in the civil service and nontransparent\nadministrative mechanisms provide additional venues for corruption. As part of its economic\nrecovery strategy, the Government has launched wide-ranging initiatives to combat corruption and\nimprove governance with the objective of promoting transparent rule-based behavior and credibly\nbind the Government to a well-defined set of procedures for the regulation of economic activities\nand resolution of disputes. These include (i) improved access to markets, (ii) legal and regulatory\nreforms, and (iii) strengthening of public administration. So far, the Government has", "16\n(i)  reformed central bank and commercial bank laws, the competition law, bankruptcy\ncodes,  tax  laws,  laws  dealing  with  property  rights,  and  business  registration\nrequirements;\n(ii)  created  institutions  that  effectively  implement  these  rules  such  as  improved\nrevenue  collection  agencies,  an  independent  central  bank,  a  competition\ncommission, and strengthened bankruptcy courts;\n(iii)  issued the Anticorruption Law in April 1999, which provides disclosure standards\nfor  public  employees  and  mandates  the  establishment  of  an  independent\nanticorruption body within two years; and\n(iv)  passed  the  Antibribery  Law  in  July  1999  specifying  criminal  sanctions  for\ncorruption.\n64. ADB is playing a major role through policy dialogue, TA, and policy loans, in helping the\nGovernment  develop  and  implement  its  governance  and  anticorruption  strategy.  ADB  has\nadopted an anticorruption action plan for Indonesia; it was discussed at a high-level meeting with\nthe Government, and in an open forum with Indonesian civil society groups and non-government\norganizations  in  July  1999.  TA  has  been  provided  for  supporting  the  establishment  of  an\nindependent anticorruption commission as well as improvements in public sector management\nand governance. 20\nC. External Assistance to the Sector\n65. The overall framework of assistance to Indonesia is being developed under the IMF-led\naid support package of which structural reform is a key component. The World Bank approved the\nPolicy  Reform  Support  Loan  (PRSL)  of  $1  billion  in  July  1998  to  address  macroeconomic\nstabilization and structural reform concerns, and has followed up with  PRSL II for $500 million\napproved in May 1999. The primary thrust of PRSL II is on efficient corporate restructuring\nthrough fiscal, monetary, and financial sector reforms; and improved governance and public\nsector management. In addition, PRSL II is supporting reforms in trade, forestry and agriculture\nsectors. As a part of its assistance package, ADB has provided $2.82 billion to support structural\nreforms for the finance, power, agriculture, and social sectors  (see paras. 69 and 70). These\nefforts are now supplemented with the Program. In developing the policy framework for these\noperations, ADB has coordinated closely with IMF and World Bank to ensure complementarity.\nADB has also coordinated with the United States Agency for International Development, which is\nproviding TA for legal, trade, and governance reforms.\n66. Several aid agencies and organizations have provided support for policy-oriented studies,\nTA and financial services for SMEs. In formulating the proposed Program, ADB has closely\ncoordinated with other sources of assistance to ensure that the various activities are mutually\nsupporting and reinforcing. At the request of the Government, ADB has taken the lead role in aid\ncoordination  for  the  SME  sector.  ADB  has  consulted  all  major  funding  agencies,  the  Asia\nFoundation, Gesellschaft fur Technische Zusammenarbeit (German Development Corporation),\nSwisscontact, Canadian International Development Agency, Australian Agency for International\nDevelopment, United States Agency for International Development, Japan Bank for International\nCooperation (JBIC; formerly Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund and Export-Import Bank of\nJapan) and the World Bank.21\n                  \n20 TA 3381\u2013INO: Establishment of an Anticorruption Commission, for $1 million, approved on 28 December 1999; TA 3214\u2013\nINO: Improving the Management of Government Onlending Operations, for $400,000, approved on 1 July 1999; and TA\n3233\u2013INO: Strategy for Restructuring Public Services, for $488,000, approved on 30 July 1999.\n21 The World Bank is examining the feasibility of providing a small learning and innovation loan to help develop possible\nproject support for SMEs. This project has been coordinated with ADB\u2019s operations and will contribute to developing\nmore efficient lending mechanisms and promoting venture capital.", "17\n67. ADB chaired four major aid coordination meetings in Jakarta in July and September 1998,\nand July and November 1999 to examine issues relating to the policy environment, financial\nservice provision, and technical and business capacity building for the SME sector. The findings\nand recommendations of other funding agencies are incorporated in the design and the policy\nreform agenda of the proposed Program. Its preparation represents a collective effort of the\nconcerned aid agencies as well as the Government.\nD. ADB\u2019s Operations and Strategy\n1. Country Strategy\n68. In  response  to  the  deepening  financial  and  economic  crisis,  ADB  has  reviewed  its\noperational priorities in consultation with the Government and adopted an interim strategy to guide\nits operations during 1998-2000. Key components of the strategy include provision of support for\nreforms of the financial sector, complemented by supporting reforms in the restructuring and\ndevelopment of trade, industry, and energy sectors and State-owned enterprises. The successful\nimplementation of reforms in these sectors is intended to help restore investors\u2019 confidence,\nimprove transparency and predictability of policy making, thereby sustaining economic recovery\nand a return to sustainable and efficient growth. The interim strategy further emphasizes support\nfor implementation of the decentralization agenda and governance reforms, and strengthened\nmeasures for poverty reduction and social protection. ADB\u2019s operational program supports the\nIMF-led aid assistance package for Indonesia. In this context, ADB has been pursuing its interim\nstrategic agenda in close coordination with other multilateral and bilateral agencies that have\nactive programs of operations in Indonesia.\n69. In June 1998, ADB approved the Financial Governance Reforms: Sector Development\nProgram loan22 that is assisting the Government to undertake wide-ranging reforms in financial\ngovernance  by  restructuring  commercial  banks,  developing  domestic  capital  markets,  and\nproviding institutional strengthening of agencies concerned with financial governance. This was\nfollowed in July 1998, by the Social Protection Sector Development Program (SDP) loan23 to\nmitigate the effects of the economic crisis on the poor and to strengthen policy and institutional\nmeasures concerning the provision of basic social services including education, health, nutrition,\nand family planning.\n70. In 1999, ADB approved three major policy-based lending initiatives including (i) Health and\nNutrition SDP loan,24 (ii) Power Sector Restructuring Program loan,25 and (iii) Community and\nLocal Government Support Sector Development loan.26 The Health and Nutrition SDP broadens\nthe policy agenda of the Social Protection SDP on effective public spending to target the provision\nof essential social services for the poor and vulnerable groups. The Power Sector Restructuring\nProgram supports the Government\u2019s reform agenda to dismantle the vertical monopoly in the\npower sector to increase private sector participation, and to move toward competitive markets for\ngeneration, transmission, and distribution. The Community and Local Government Support SDP\nsupports  the  implementation  of  administrative  and  fiscal  decentralization  agenda  and  the\ninvolvement of local communities and civil society in development planning and implementation.\n                  \n22 Loans 1618/1619/1620-INO: Financial Governance Reforms: Sector Development Program, for $1,497 million, approved\non 25 June 1998.\n23 Loan 1622-INO: Social Protection Development Program and Loan 1623-INO: Social Protection Development Project, for\n$100 million and $200 million approved on 9 July 1998.\n24 Loan 1675-INO: Health and Nutrition Program and Loan 1676-INO: Health and Nutrition Project, for $100 million and $200\nmillion approved on 25 March 1999.\n25 Loan 1673-INO: Power Sector Restructuring Program, for $ 380 million approved on 23 March 1999.\n26 Loan 1678-INO: Community and Local Government Support Sector Development Program, for $ 320 million approved on\n25 March 1999.", "18\n71. Consistent with the interim strategy, ADB places greater emphasis on managing the loan\nportfolio to Indonesia to ensure its continued relevance in the current situation. In 1998, ADB in\ncooperation  with  the  Government  undertook  a  major  review  of  its  portfolio  to  reassess  the\nrelevance of all the ongoing projects in the context of the crisis, including their contribution to\naddressing immediate economic and social development concerns. The review resulted in scaling\ndown  a  number  of  projects  and  canceling  about  $1  billion  from  the  then  undisbursed  loan\nbalances. In 1999, ADB and the Government undertook another portfolio review that focused on\nrestructuring slow-moving and poorly performing projects. Together with the portfolio review, loan\nsavings amounting to $500 million were identified in 1999 for cancellation.\n2. Sector Strategy\n72. ADB\u2018s  strategy  for  the  industry  sector  aims  to  help  the  Government  increase\ncompetitiveness, improve the business environment, and develop a modern financial system that\nprovides the range of instruments and volume of financing required to sustain industrial growth.\nThis involves strengthening institutions needed for the restructuring of the corporate and financial\nsectors, as well as sector and economywide reforms that promote competition, governance, and\nbalanced growth in both the financial and industry sectors.\n73. Building on the policy framework of the Financial Governance Reforms: SDP, ADB is\nassisting the Government implement the following:\n(i)  structural reforms to increase competition and efficiency, and improve governance\nand transparency in trade and industry;\n(ii)  corporate restructuring to preserve productive assets and achieve efficient debt\nrecovery that promotes the health of the financial sector;\n(iii)  short-term measures including adequate working capital and provision of trade\nfinance to sustain the corporate sector and restore growth and profitability; and\n(iv)  financial sector reforms to restore credit flows, improve financial governance, and\nrebuild the financial sector, and promote the development of nonbank financial\ninstitutions, including the contractual savings industry.\n74. The  Program,  together  with  a  program  for  corporate  governance  for  State-owned\nenterprises, which is being processed, will help the Government meet the immediate challenge of\nbuilding a more conducive business environment and promoting structural reforms that increase\ncompetitiveness and improve governance.\nV. THE PROGRAM\nA. Rationale\n75. The main challenge now facing policymakers is to devise and implement policies that will\nallow Indonesia to recover from the economic crisis and stimulate broad-based growth to mitigate\nthe hardships of those most adversely affected. Together with banking, the industry sector, which\nhas strongly contributed to the growth of the Indonesian economy in the past decades, has been\nthe hardest hit by the economic crisis. The depth of the crisis and the severity of the contraction of\nindustrial output have been exacerbated by the legacy of distortionary industrial policies that\nrestricted competition, favored large firms, promoted rent seeking, increased costs, impeded the\ngrowth of SMEs, and led to a highly concentrated industrial structure. These distortions limit the\nability of private investors to respond to new opportunities, inhibit economic restructuring, and\nincrease the vulnerability of the industry sector to the adverse effects of a weak banking system\nand external financial shocks.", "19\n76. More  than  two  years  since  the  crisis  started,  there  is  a  pressing  need  for  decisive\nmeasures to build on the recent macroeconomic gains and rapidly restore confidence of investors,\nlenders, and producers. Restoring confidence and growth requires a fundamental transformation\nof the economy by removing the impediments to the development of a more competitive industry\nsector. These include: (i) high transaction costs resulting from excessive licensing and regulatory\nrequirements;  (ii) concentrated  industrial  structure  dominated  by  a  few  large  firms;  (iii) an\ninconsistent  and  inadequate  policy  framework  for  industrial  competition;  (iv)  inefficiencies  in\nmarkets and resource allocation caused by protection of existing firms from foreign and domestic\ncompetition; (v) a discretionary investment policy that generates uncertainty and discriminates\nbetween  domestic  and  foreign  investment,  and  (vi) inefficiencies  and  delays  in  customs\nprocedures.\n77. While these policies have impeded the economic recovery, their adverse effects have\nbeen more pronounced on SMEs, which can ill afford the high transactions costs resulting from\nthe complex regulatory framework. Historically, Indonesia promoted SME development through a\nlarge  number  of  special  programs,  incentives,  and  concessions  to  encourage  their  growth,\nreflecting a view that the sector was weak and in need of protection. This approach to the support\nof SMEs is no longer sustainable given the ongoing structural adjustment of the Indonesian\neconomy based on comparative and competitive advantage. With sharply constrained budgetary\nresources, the Government is no longer in a position to channel resources directly to and for\nSMEs as in the past. The new economic environment requires a reorientation of policies to make\nSMEs  efficient  and  competitive.  Special  concessions  and  incentives  protecting  SMEs  from\ncompetitive forces will render them inefficient and incapable of coping with the new market\nconditions. International experience suggests significant benefits from SME support policies that\nfocus  less  upon  the  notion  of  size  per  se,  and  more  on  creating  a  business  climate  that\nencourages the emergence of new and efficient firms.\n78. Addressing these issues will require a coordinated policy response to promote competition\nand  facilitate  structural  change  through  smoother  entry  and  exit  by  firms,  both  foreign  and\ndomestic,  large  or  small.  Without  further  deregulation  that  reduces  the  high  cost  of  doing\nbusiness,  measures  to  strengthen  domestic  competition  will  not  be  successful.  Only  such\nderegulation will ensure that markets are operated efficiently and transparently, so that when\nresources are committed to commercial activities, there are reasonable prospects that they will be\nemployed productively. It is also necessary to improve governance, strengthen the commercial\nlegal environment for competition, increase transparency and consistency in the policy making\nprocess, improve customs performance, and reduce corruption in the bureaucracy.\n79. Given  their  high  potential  for  growth,  the  Government\u2019s  reform  strategy  includes  a\nrenewed policy focus on SME development. Many SMEs will grow significantly without exiting that\nsize category, while others will eventually become larger firms. This is in sharp contrast to micro\nor household enterprises, which rarely graduate from their size class. A coordinated approach to\npromoting competition and leveling the playing field for all enterprises will promote SMEs with\ncorresponding benefits in terms of broad-based growth of employment and incomes. With the\nrevival of industrial growth and the industrialization process, the distribution of manufacturing\nemployment is expected to shift out of household activities into wage employment. SMEs will play\nan important role in absorbing this labor shift.\n80. Greater  competition  that  promotes  growth,  a  dynamic  SME  sector,  and  the  resulting\nimpetus to structural change will lead to a transformation of the highly concentrated structure of\nindustry  in  Indonesia  with  concomitant  benefits  in  terms  of  greater  efficiency  in  resource\nallocation, reduced market power, and increased consumer welfare.", "20\nB.  Objectives and Scope\n81. The overall goal of the Industrial Competitiveness and SME Development Program is\nhigher, sustained economic growth through more efficient resource allocation. The Program\u2019s\nobjective  is  to  achieve  economic  recovery  by  encouraging  a  more  diversified  and  efficient\nindustrial structure through deregulation and adoption of policies that promote competition and\nprovide a level playing field for all enterprises including SMEs. These policies are expected to\ncontribute  to  restoring  investor  confidence  and  lead  to  renewed  growth.  Thus,  the  Program\nfocuses on the following areas (for details, see the Policy Matrix in Appendix 1):\n(i)  strengthening competition by (a) establishing an appropriate legal environment for\ncommercial activity; (b) simplifying the regulatory framework; (c) removing  barriers\nto domestic competition and trade; and (d) liberalizing international trade;\n(ii)  facilitating  investment  and  trade  by  (a)  strengthening  the  policy  framework\ngoverning domestic investment and FDI, and (b) improving duty drawback and\ncustoms procedures; and\n(iii)  rationalizing  assistance  to  SMEs  by  (a) improving  policy  coordination  and\nimplementation,  (b)  improving  financial  intermediation,  and  (c) strengthening\ntechnical and business service support.\nC.  Policy Framework and Actions\n1. Strengthening Competition\na. Strengthening the Commercial Legal and Regulatory Environment\n82. Beginning in 1998, as a part of the Program, the Government has initiated a far reaching\nreform  of  the  commercial  legal  system  to  promote  competition  and  provide  individuals  and\nbusinesses with greater certainty on their rights, and with predictability relative to their commercial\ntransactions and legal relationships. To facilitate resource mobility and exit mechanisms the\nGovernment approved  a  new  Bankruptcy  Law  in  August  1998  and  issued  a  supplementary\nPresidential  Decree  and  implementing  regulations  that  established  commercial  courts  with\nexclusive  jurisdiction  over  bankruptcy  proceedings,  permitted  qualified  private  sector\nprofessionals  to  serve  as  receivers  and  administrators  in  bankruptcy  and  reorganization\nproceedings,  and  specified  time  limits  for  the  proceedings.  Supported  by  a  number  of  aid\nagencies, the Government completed training for the first group of commercial court judges,\nreceivers,  and  administrators.  Complementing  these  measures,  the  Jakarta  Initiative  has\nestablished a mechanism for out of court settlements of debt-restructuring that will facilitate\ncorporate restructuring and resource mobility.\n83. However, both the court and out-of court avenues for debt resolution have suffered from\nimplementation difficulties and delays. The number of bankruptcy cases has been small, and the\nquality of some judgements questionable. The out-of-court avenue for restructuring has been\nslow. The Government has, therefore, initiated a review with a view to developing a more effective\nstrategy. Based on this review, a Financial Sector Policy Committee was established in December\n1999 to implement an enhanced restructuring strategy, and IBRA and the Government were\nempowered to take steps against recalcitrant debtors including that of referral to the Jakarta\nInitiative, and to the Attorney General for initiation of bankruptcy proceedings. These measures\nsignificantly strengthen mechanisms and incentives for bankruptcy proceedings and out-of-court\nsettlements of debt restructuring, and are complemented by a renewed focus on strengthening\ninsolvency procedures through judicial training and reform. As a result of these measures, by\nDecember 1999, 620 of 800 large debtors (i.e. with loans over Rp50 billion; these accounting for\n70 percent of non-performing loans) had signed letters of commitment with specified tests of", "21\ncooperation; a data base has been created of 3,900 debtors with debts over Rp1 billion; and the\nfirst round of legal actions initiated against 119 non-cooperating debtors.\n84. To  further  promote  industrial  restructuring,  the  Program  strengthens  the  legal  basis\nallowing firms entry into markets and providing them adequate protection from anticompetitive\npractices. In March 1999, the Government issued the Competition Law that, in accordance with\ninternational best practice, (i) focuses on fair market conduct (ii) applies to both SOEs and private\nenterprises and (iii) makes provision for an independent commission to prevent anticompetitive\npractices.  A Presidential  Decree  was  issued  in  July  1999  establishing  the  independent\nCommission for Competition Supervision. By June 2000, the Program envisages that an adequate\nbudget and staff will be provided to enable the Commission to undertake its initial background\nwork.  By September 2001, the Government is expected to operationalize the commission and\nhave issued its manual of administrative procedure, and the rules and procedures governing\nmarket conduct and anti-competitive practices.  An ADB-financed TA will support capacity building\nof the commission (see paras. 119 to 122).\nb. Simplification of the Regulatory Framework\n85. The Government established a Deregulation and Competition Task Force in September\n1999 to work closely with the Commission for Competition Supervision to rationalize and simplify\nthe regulatory regime, promote competition, and create a level playing field for all enterprises. In\nthis connection, the Task Force will (i) review and devise criteria for the economic evaluation of\ncommercial laws and regulations from the perspective of the net public benefit; (ii) complete the\nreview of existing laws, regulations, and decrees for agreed manufacturing subsectors that are\ninconsistent with the Competition Law, with a view to determining their cost and benefit to the\npublic  and  making  recommendations  for  improving  or  repealing  such  laws,  regulations,  and\ndecrees; (iii) identify existing licenses, approvals, and permits imposing high compliance costs on\nSMEs,  and  develop  proposals  for  eliminating  or  replacing  them.  The  Task  Force  will,  by\nSeptember 2001, publish a report of its findings and recommendations. Taking into account the\nTask Force\u2019s recommendations, and in consultation with ADB, the Government will simplify the\nregulatory framework.\nc. Promotion of Domestic Competition by Removing Entry Barriers to\nDomestic Trade\n86. The Program supports the Government\u2019s efforts to increase competition in domestic trade\nby eliminating entry barriers to the participation of domestic investment and FDI, and removing\ndomestic marketing and distribution restraints applicable to cloves, paper, plywood, and cement.\nSince attracting foreign distributors/wholesalers is an important objective under the Program, in\nOctober 1998 the Government revoked the Investment Coordination Board (BKPM) Decree Nos.\n11/SK/1998 and 12/SK/1998, which restricted FDI in these areas. Foreign investors are now\nallowed to undertake wholesale and retail activities in the domestic market and act as general\nexporters and importers. Among others, this will benefit local exporters, particularly SMEs, that\nare currently unable to afford to enter the export business on their own.\n87. The  Government  is  also  strengthening  competition  and  the  efficiency  of  resource\nallocation by (i) eliminating controls on ex-factory prices of fertilizer set by the Ministry of Finance\n(MOF); (ii) eliminating the fertilizer distribution monopoly held by the state-owned PT Pusri and\nvillage cooperatives; and (iii) developing an action plan to liberalize the distribution of oil products\nand the gasoline retail subsector. Actions (i) and (ii) have been completed and action (iii) will be\ncompleted by September 2001.", "22\nd. Strengthening  of  International  Competition  by  Reducing  Tariff  and\nNontariff Barriers\n88. The Program supports the Government\u2019s proposals for tariff reductions under Asean Free\nTrade Area. These envisage a maximum rate of 10 percent and virtually all rates reduced to\n0-5 percent by 2003. To gradually move toward these long term targets some key tariff reductions\nwere made between April 1998 and October 1999. These include reduction in: (i) the maximum\ntariff  rate  on  automotive  components  from  200  percent  to  80  percent;  (ii)  tariff  rates  by\n5 percentage points for all goods with rates of 15-25 percent (excluding motor vehicles and\nalcohol); (iii) tariff  rates by 5 percentage points for nonfood agriculture products; and (iv) zero\ntariffs  in  the  final  rate  of  import  duty  on  basic  materials  for  the  production  of  automotive\ncomponents. Finally, imports of goods and materials from bonded warehouses to be processed,\nassembled, or installed in other goods for manufacturing motor vehicles destined for exports were\nexempted from import duties.\n89. Following the above, Indonesia now has one of the most transparent tariff structures in the\nworld with almost all specific and split tariffs replaced by ad valorem rates in blocks of 5 percent.\nAs of November 1999, there were 7,274 tariff lines with only 74 of them exceeding 30 percent and\nthe bulk of them (5,249) being between zero (1,508 lines) and 10 percent.\n90. The  Government  has  also  been  liberalizing  the  historically  complex  and  restrictive\nstructure of nontariff barriers. In this connection, by December 1999, it has (i) eliminated BULOG\u2019s\nimport  monopoly;  (ii)  abolished  local  content  requirements  for  dairy  products;  (iii) abolished\nnontariff barriers on imports of used ships; and (iv) accelerated the phasing out of protection of\nthe automotive industry by eliminating local content requirements for the industry. In addition, as\nof December 1999, the restrictive import licensing requirement has been liberalized on about 120\nof 190 items. Of the remaining items still subject to restrictive licensing, the Government is\nexpected to retain licenses imposed for environmental, moral, safety, security, and public health\nreasons.  By September 2001, all IP and IT licenses outside of these categories will be liberalized\ninto a system of transparent and non-discriminatory instruments involving either (a) conversion\ninto the general class of licenses available to all interested importers through simple registration,\nor (b) conversion into duties and excise taxes.\n2. Investment Promotion and Trade Facilitation\na. Improvement of  Investment Policy Framework and Practice\n91. The Program supports the Government\u2019s objective of introducing a new investment policy\nand law that will provide a more liberal, transparent and uniform legal and institutional framework\nfor investment. This will improve confidence of investors and lay the foundation for a more\ncompetitive  and  robust  industrial  sector  that  is  consistent  with  Indonesia\u2019s  comparative\nadvantage. By reducing the opportunities for discretionary and ad hoc provision of incentives, the\nProgram will reduce opportunities for corruption and contribute to improved governance.\n92. With a view to eliminating discriminatory constraints embedded in the legal and regulatory\nframework,  between  July  and  September  1999,  the  Government  took  the  following  steps:\n(i) establishment of performance targets for approval \u201cin principle\u201d for FDI within no more than\n10 working days for investments up to $100 million and 20 working days for investments above\n$100  million;  (ii) relaxation  of  the  requirement  that  FDI  be  located  in  designated  industrial\nestates/zones; (iii) transfer of investment approvals below $100 million from the President to the\nInvestment Board  and (iv) transfer of approvals below  Rp10 billion from the Investment Board to\nregional authorities. These measures were capped in November 1999 by the elimination of the\nrequirement of Presidential approvals for foreign investment. Futhermore, all investors are now", "23\nable to seek approval of investment proposals, regardless of the amount, from the Investment\nBoard, the regional investment coordinating boards, or Indonesian Embassies. By September\n2000 the Government will also have removed restrictions that FDI can only be made in existing\nfirms to \u201crescue and restore\u201d these firms.\n93. Consistent with a more open approach to attracting foreign investment, the Government\nhas curtailed the negative investment list that limits FDI and reduced the number of sectors closed\nto new FDI from 35 prior to the crisis to 9 as of June 1999. By September 2000, the Government\nwill further reduce the number of sectors closed to FDI; and, by December 2000 reduce the\nnumber of sectors (i) reserved for small enterprises and (ii) in which enterprises are required to\nenter into mandatory business partnerships with SMEs.\n94. Based on the liberalizing measures above, and on a review of international experience, by\nDecember 2000 the Government plans to announce an investment policy statement that will set\nout its incentive framework and approach for promoting and facilitating investment in accordance\nwith international best practice. The policy statement will outline key steps to be taken to attract\nforeign investment, strengthen the Investment Board\u2019s role, rationalize the provision of incentives\non a sustainable basis, and outline the scope of the new law for investment. Following this, an\ninvestment law based on the investment policy statement will be issued by September 2001.\nLaunching its work in this area, the Government is reevaluating the role of the Investment Board.\nBased on this, the role of the Investment Board as a resource centre for investors and as an\nagency for investment facilitation and promotion will be strengthened by September 2001, and\nreflected in the budget and staffing of appropriate departments.\n b. Streamlining  of  Duty  Drawback  Procedures  and  Improvement  of\nTransparency\n95. As  highlighted  above,  the  trade  rationalization  and  liberalization  program  will  be\naccelerated to reduce differential tariff treatment of firms and reduce the duties on imported raw\nmaterials and intermediate products. While this will ultimately reduce the significance of incentives\ncurrently provided via duty drawbacks and rebates, there remains significant scope to improve the\nsystem\u2019s treatment of and accessibility to SMEs and indirect exporters. The Government will\ncomplete  a  review  of  duty  drawback  procedures  by  March  2001  and  implement  the\nrecommendations arising out of the review.\nc.   Facilitation of Trade Through Improved Customs Procedures\n96. Indonesia\u2019s  recovery  from  the  economic  crisis  depends  in  large  part  on  revitalizing\nindustries  that  depend  critically  on  trade,  both  importers  and  exporters.  Inefficient  customs\nprocedures  have  undermined  the  impact  of  trade  and  industrial  policy  liberalization  as  they\nobstruct and delay the smooth flow of traded goods. The Government is improving the efficiency\nof  customs  procedures  and  strengthening  the  Customs  and  Port  authorities  by  eliminating\ndiscretionary  interventions  by  using  red  and  green  channel  system;  reducing  excessive\nexaminations; incorporating performance standards; and making other procedural, administrative,\nand organizational changes. Under these new arrangements, effective June 1999 (i) no more than\n10 percent of imports are subject to inspection; (ii) the release order for imports is to be issued\nautomatically within 4 hours of submission of import documents unless it has been classified for\nscrutiny through the red channel; and (iii) imports routed through the red channel are to be\nreleased  within  12 hours  of  submission  of  documents.  These  measures  and  performance\nstandards for document clearances conform to international best practice and place greater\nreliance on processing approvals through modern computerized systems. They thus help avoid\ndiscretionary interventions by Customs while enabling the transport of a major portion of imports\ndirectly from ports and airports to importer premises. The Program will monitor the progress in\nachieving closer integration between importers, shipping companies and banks.", "24\n3. Rationalization of  Assistance to SMEs\n97. The  dynamics  of  SME  growth  have  important  implications  for  policy  making.  SMEs\noperate in a highly competitive and risky environment, are conservatively leveraged, and use\nsmall amounts of capital that is turned over rapidly. Those able to produce for a niche market,\nadapting quality and cost to market demand, have high potential. The sector experiences high exit\nand entry rates. Rather than being a symptom of structural weakness that requires corrective\npolicies, the high rate of entry and exit reflects the flexibility with which the sector adjusts to\nchanging market conditions, including sharp macroeconomic downturns like that experienced by\nIndonesia. The ongoing structural transformation of the economy provides opportunities for both\nexisting and new SMEs, and requires a reorientation of the approach to promoting SMEs away\nfrom its previous focus on protecting the sector to one in which the focus is on providing it greater\nflexibility. The thrust of the policy focus should thus be on reducing excessive bureaucratic\ninterference rather than on seeking additional support programs. Where support programs are\nrequired they should be demand driven and supplied by the market rather than Government\ndepartments.\n98. Reflecting the above considerations, the Government\u2019s primary objective is to identify and\nset an appropriate overall strategy. The strategy will, in turn, set the direction for policy development\nand determine what, if any, specific programs are required for SMEs. Under the Program, the\nGovernment will enhance the efficiency of SMEs through industrial deregulation (which will reduce\ntransactions costs), more effective financial intermediation, and improved provision of business\nand technical services. These policy reforms will be formulated and implemented in consultation\nwith stakeholders. The Government will launch surveys and studies to update information on the\nimpact  of  the  economic  crisis  on  SMEs  and  design  appropriate  policy  and  monitoring\nmechanisms.\na. Broadening  of  Participation  of  SMEs  in  Policy  Making  and\nImplementation, and Improved Interagency Coordination\n99. To coordinate the design and implementation of a reform strategy for SMEs, in September\n1999 the Government established the SME Task Force. An SME Policy Workshop was held in\nDecember 1999 with the support of aid agencies including ADB.  Based on its deliberations,\nbroad terms of reference were drawn up for the SME Task Force. By September 2000, the Task\nForce will develop a medium-term strategy for SME development, and implement measures to\nensure that this strategy is implemented and publicly disseminated. The strategy is expected to\ncover the following: (i) developing an institutional framework for SME policy implementation;\n(ii) expanding access to finance for SMEs; (iii) making business development services more\nresponsive to SME needs;  (iv) streamlining government regulations affecting small and medium\nbusinesses; and (v) monitoring and evaluation of government SME programs. These efforts will\nbe supported by TA from ADB (paras. 123 to 126).\n100. In 1997, the Government initiated steps to identify the plethora of regulations and licenses\nfaced by SMEs. As part of these efforts, the State Ministry of Cooperatives and Small and\nMedium Enterprises (SMOCSME) undertook limited studies on the licensing requirements for\nSMEs. Studies have also been carried out by nongovernment organizations (NGOs). These\nefforts will be  supplemented with a more comprehensive survey that will identify bottlenecks and\nrecommend simplification of the regulatory system.  Bank TA will assist in this undertaking (see\nparas. 119-122).", "25\nb. Efficiency of Financial Intermediation\n101. To reduce wastage of public resources and opportunities for rent seeking, and to improve\nmarket access of all economic sectors to sustainable sources of finance on market terms, the\nGovernment will rationalize and streamline SME finance programs with improved risk sharing and\nrisk assessment by intermediating banks. As a first step, the Government has eliminated BI\u2019s role\nin the provision of liquidity credit that financed most such programs. In November 1999, the 16\ncredit programs previously financed or managed by BI were transferred to three institutions that\nwill  act  as  coordinators  in  their  continued  operation:  (i) 12 credit  programs  for  SMEs  and\ncooperatives will be managed by the state-owned company, PT Madani;27 (ii) KUT and credit\nschemes for primary credit cooperatives and sugar cane cooperatives have been transferred to\nBRI; and (iii) the credit program for low cost housing has been transferred to Bank Tabungan\nNegara.\n102. Under the Guidance of the SME Task Force, the Government will launch an evaluation of\nthe  rationale,  effectiveness,  and  performance  of  all  existing  credit  schemes  for  SMEs,\ncooperatives, and plantations (currently being managed by PT Madani). The recommendations of\nthe review and evaluations carried out in consultation with ADB will be implemented in a phased\nmanner starting from September  2000.  By December 2000, the credit schemes will have been\nconsolidated to no more than two schemes for cooperatives and SMEs. These schemes are to be\nbased on a single interest rate determined on commercial principles with full risk of default borne\nby participating banks. Interest rate subsidies, if any, will be supported by adequate budget\nprovisions.\n103. Similarly,  the  Government  will  initiate  the  evaluation  of  agricultural  credit  schemes,\ncurrently managed on its behalf by BRI, with the view to developing a more effective strategy for\nthe provision of rural credit.\n104. To improve financial intermediation, by June 2000, the Government will announce a plan\nto phase out mandatory lending requirements under which commercial banks must lend a certain\nproportion of their loan portfolio to SMEs.  At the same time, measures will be taken to encourage\ncommercial banks to develop effective lending mechanisms to improve financial intermediation for\nSMEs.  The key objective is to reduce the transaction costs for SME credit through use of proper\ncredit  information  and  monitoring  systems  that  identify  creditworthy  borrowers  and  facilitate\nprudent lending decisions and an effective loan recovery mechanism backed by a registry for\ncollateral.  These measures will draw upon the results achieved by BRI and other sound SME-\nlending institutions that have demonstrated the efficacy of these techniques, while continuing to\nlend at market-based rates even during the economic crisis. These efforts will be supported by TA\nprovided under the Program (see paras. 123 to 126).\nc. Commercial Orientation of Technical and Business Support\n105. Under supervision of the SME Task Force, by September 2001 the Government will\nconsolidate and streamline the existing SME technical and business support operations. This\nundertaking will involve (i) rationalizing the responsibilities for designing, implementing, monitoring\nand evaluating business service programs; (ii) shifting from supply pushed to demand driven\n                  \n27 The schemes are Working Capital Credits\u2013Bank Perkreditan Rakyat/Bank Perkreditan Rakyat Syariah (KMK-BPR/BPRS);\nMicro-and Small-Scale Entrepreneurs\u2019 Credits through Bank Perkreditan Rakyat (KPKM-BPR); Micro-and Small-Scale\nEntrepreneurs\u2019 Credits through Bank Perkreditan Rakyat (KPKM-BPR); Micro-and Small-Scale Entrepreneurs\u2019 Credits\nthrough Commercial Banks (KPKM-Commercial Banks); City Bus General Transport Businesses\u2019 Credits (KUAUBP);\nNational Private Large Plantations\u2019 Credits (PBSN); Transmigration People Core Company Credits (PIR-Trans); Primary\nCooperatives Credits for Members-General (KKPA-General); Primary Cooperatives Credits for Members-Profit Sharing\n(KKPA-Profit-Sharing); Primary Cooperatives Credits for Members-Fishermen (KKPA-fishermen); Primary Cooperatives\nCredits for Members-Poultry (KKPA-Poultry); Primary Cooperatives Credits for Members-Indonesian Manpower (KKPA-\nTKI); Primary Cooperatives Credits for Members-the People\u2019s Transmigration Core Plantation (KKPA-PIR Trans).", "26\nservices; (iii) shifting of service delivery from the Government to private sector providers. The\nSME Task Force will develop performance criteria to evaluate support operations and prepare an\naction  plan  to  commercialize  and  eventually  privatize  commercially  oriented  technical  and\nbusiness services including technical service centers and small business industrial estates.\nD. Economic and Poverty Impact\n1. Economic Impact\n106. In the long run, the Program will result in higher industrial productivity and efficiency.  The\nProgram\u2019s support of reforms to deregulate entry and exit will raise capacity utilization and\nproductivity in the medium term. By enhancing competitive pressures these policy changes are\nexpected to induce technical change, innovation, and sustained effort to raise productivity and\nreduce costs. By encouraging FDI the Program eases barriers to the free flow of resources and\nenhances access to technology and managerial and organizational expertise.\n107. While  promoting  investment,  however,  the  Program  will  be  affected  by  the  broader\neconomic environment that affects investment decisions. The supply or investment response will\ndepend critically on the impact of stabilization measures, with substantial international evidence\nindicating that resumption of private investment may be delayed in the aftermath of stabilization.28\nThe initial contractionary monetary policy put pressure on interest rates, reducing investment and\ngrowth of output. Despite recent declines in interest rates, there is continued investor reluctance\nto commit resources given their perceived uncertainty regarding the policy regime. The sharp\ndecline in investment following the implementation of stabilization measures in 1998 is consistent\nwith international experience.  However, the Government's recent success in lowering inflation is\nhighly encouraging as experience from other countries shows that a sustained low inflation rate is\nstrongly associated with investment recovery.\n2. Poverty Impact\n108. The  Poverty  Impact  Assessment  is  provided  in  Appendix  4.  The  actions  under  the\nProgram are fully consistent with the three key components of ADB\u2019s poverty reduction strategy,\nnamely, pro-poor sustainable economic growth, good governance, and social development.29 Pro-\npoor sustainable economic growth is to be achieved through the Program\u2019s focus on removing\nmarket-distorting  restrictions  on  imports  and  exports,  eliminating  credit  subsidies,  and\nderegulating  to  level  the  playing  field  for  all  enterprises  and  provide  a  conducive  business\nenvironment. These measures will expand economic opportunities by reversing policies that often\nprovided protection and assistance to large or influential firms or business groups. While the\nProgram will lead to income generation and higher employment, one of the proposed TAs (see\nparas. 123 to 126) provides a mechanism for monitoring the impact of the economic crisis and\nrestructuring  on  vulnerable  groups.  The  Program\u2019s  focus  on  improving  governance  by\nstrengthening  regulation  of  competitive  markets,  and  institutionalizing  greater  participation  of\nSMEs, women entrepreneurs, and other typical low-income stakeholders in the policy formulation\nand implementation process contributes to poverty reduction by way of empowerment of affected\nclasses  of  civil  society.  The  identification  and  support  of  groups  representing  female  SME\nentrepreneurs carried out under the Program, and their participation in its implementation, will\npromote gender development.\n                  \n28The general proposition is that the predictability of the incentive structure and the macroeconomic policy environment are\nthe most important factors explaining private investment. The volatility of output, prices, the real exchange rate and export\nrevenues tend to reduce private investment. A.Solimano, \"How Private Investment Reacts to Changing Macroeconomic\nConditions\", World Bank Working Paper Series No. 212 (1989); and A. Dixit, \"Investment and Hysterisis\", Journal of\nEconomic Perspectives, 1991.\n29 Fighting Poverty in Asia and the Pacific: The Poverty Reduction Strategy of the Asian Development Bank, approved on\n9 November 1999.", "27\n109. The experience with alternative reform strategies in Indonesia indicates that trade and\nindustrial deregulation more effectively promotes productivity growth, higher real wages, and\ngreater employment of unskilled labor than do policies that impair competition. Improvements in\nreal wages and rapid creation of jobs for unskilled and semiskilled workers is key to long-term\npoverty reduction. The Program\u2019s focus on promoting SME growth and development contributes\nto the demand for wage employment of these categories of workers. As it is SMEs rather than\nlarge enterprises that are the primary buyers of goods and services from the household or cottage\nsector from whom the poor are predominantly drawn, the vitality of the SME sector is essential to\npoverty reduction. The liberalization of the enabling environment under the Program will allow this\nsector to become more dynamic and productive, absorb greater numbers of poor into the labor\nforce, and increase the standard of living for a significant proportion of the population already\nengaged in the sector. As large numbers of women are employed in the sector or operate as SME\nbusiness owners, particularly at the lowest end of the scale, they will benefit from the program\nreforms. The SME sector has also shown great resilience and ability to adapt to the changes\nbrought about by the economic crisis. For these reasons, strong recovery in the SME sector will\nnot only increase demand for the goods and services of the poor and increase the standard of\nliving for a large proportion of the labor force, but will also be seen as a positive sign of the\nbeginning of the end of the crisis.\n110. The  Program  does  not  contribute  to  significant  additional  unemployment,  as  this\nadjustment had occurred over 1998 and 1999. The Government\u2019s capacity to mitigate the social\ncosts of adjustment are augmented by the resources provided by the Program, which can be\ndrawn  from  the  budget  in  a  general  way  to  supplement  the  considerable  resources  the\nGovernment  is  directing  towards  this  objective.  The  success  of  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  in\nmanaging  the  adjustment  process  is  reflected  in  the  aggregate  level  of  consumption  in  the\neconomy showing a relatively small decline in real terms in 1998, and a return in 1999 to levels\nclose to those prior to the crisis. These aggregate figures are supported by the preliminary results\nof ADB\u2019s country poverty study which indicate that the incidence of poverty has increased less\nthan had originally been thought.\nVI. THE PROPOSED LOAN\nA.  Amount of Loan, and Source of Funds\n111. It is proposed that ADB support the Government\u2019s policy reforms by providing a loan of\n$200 million.30 The Borrower will be the Republic of Indonesia. The loan will be from the ADB\u2019s\nordinary capital resources with interest determined in accordance with the ADB\u2019s pool-based\nvariable lending rate system for US dollar loans and a commitment charge of 0.75 percent per\nannum in accordance with the ADB\u2019s standard terms for program loans. A front-end fee will be\npayable in an amount equal to one percent of the amount of the loan. ADB shall be entitled to\nwithdraw and pay itself on behalf of the Government the amount of the front-end fee from the loan\naccount. The loan will have an amortization period of 15 years, including a grace period of\n3 years. It is expected that the loan proceeds will be utilized over a period of 18 months from the\ndate of loan effectiveness. Total adjustment costs related to the Program is estimated at about\n$650 million during the Program period. These consist of:\n(i)  lost revenues from tariff reform (about $150 million);\n(ii)  costs of administrative reforms linked to the computerization and reorganization of\ncustoms ($25 million);\n(iii)  establishment of Commission for Competition Supervision and other administrative\nreforms ($5 million); and\n                  \n30 The possibilities of loan cofinancing have been pursued in conjunction with the ADB loan from the beginning of processing.\nPotential loan cofinanciers include, among others, JBIC.", "28\n(iv)  lost revenues resulting from the simplification of the licensing and approval regime\n($470 million over two years).\nThe  elimination  of  protection  in  a  number  of  sectors,  including  fertilizer  distribution,\npetrochemicals  and  other  domestic  trade  sectors  is  expected  to  impose  upfront  costs  to\nenterprises in terms of restructuring and retooling needs to meet the requirements of a more\ncompetitive environment introduced by the Program. These costs are expected to be considerable\nbut are difficult to quantify.\nB. Implementation Arrangements\n1. Executing Agency and Steering Committee\n112. MOF  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  and  will  (i)  have  overall  supervision  of  program\nimplementation, (ii) ensure that the reforms under the Program are undertaken in line with the\nagreed upon timetable,  (iii) initiate withdrawals under the loan, and (iv) allocate and monitor the\nuse of counterpart funds.\n113. MOF will be assisted by a program steering committee (PSC) for interagency consultation\nand coordination relating to item (i) above. The Coordinating Ministry for Economy and Finance\nwill chair the PSC comprising senior officials from BAPPENAS, MOIT, MOF, BI, the Investment\nBoard,  and  SMOCSME.  A  program  implementation  secretariat  will  be  established  within\nBAPPENAS to support the functioning of the PSC.\n2. Procurement and Disbursement\n114. The proceeds of the loan will be utilized to finance the foreign exchange costs of items\nproduced in, and procured from, ADB\u2019s member countries (other than those items specified in\nAppendix 5 and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources, including other loans\nmade by ADB). The Government will certify that, (i) in case the proceeds of the loan will finance\nimports already made, the value of eligible imports in the period concerned exceed the amount of\nthe requested withdrawal, or (ii) in case the loan proceeds are to finance goods to be imported,\nthe value of eligible imports in the immediately preceding one year period are equal to or greater\nthan the amount of the requested disbursement plus all other amounts expected to be withdrawn\nfrom the loan during the succeeding one year. ADB will have the right to audit the use of the loan\nproceeds and to verify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification.\n3. Counterpart Funds\n115. The counterpart funds to be generated out of the loan proceeds will be used by the\nGovernment to support the costs of structural adjustment and other activities consistent with the\nProgram.\n4. Tranching and Monitoring\n116. The Program period will be two years. The first tranche, equivalent to $100 million, will be\nmade available upon loan effectiveness planned for March 2000. The conditions for release of the\nfirst tranche includes 30 policy actions that have been fully complied with. The second tranche\nincludes an incentive subtranche, equivalent to $50 million and a final subtranche equivalent to\n$50 million. The incentive subtranche is to be released by December 2000, upon satisfactory\ncompliance with the following conditions:\n(i)  Provision of an adequate  budget and  staff for the Commission for Competition\nSupervision;", "29\n(ii)  Issuance of a Presidential Decree to reduce the number of business fields to new\nforeign investment;\n(iii)  Issuance  of  a  Presidential  Decree  to  reduce  the  number  of  business  fields\nreserved  for  small  firms  and  in  which  enterprises  are  required  to  enter  into\nmandatory business partnerships with small firms;\n(iv)  Removal of restrictions to allow FDI to be made in existing firms to \u201crescue and\nrestore these firms;\n(v)  Issuance of an Investment Policy Satement setting out the Government\u2019s approach\nto further streamlining and rationalizing the promotion and facilitation of investment\nin accordance with international best practices; and\n(vi)  Rationalization  of  the  SME  credit  program  by  reducing  the  number  of  credit\nschemes to no more than two catering for cooperatives and for SME sector. These\nschemes are to be based on a single interest rate determined on commercial\nprinciples with full risk of nonpayment being borne by participating banks. Interest\nrate subsidies, if any, are to be supported by adequate provisions in the budget.\n117. The final subtranche of the second tranche, equivalent to $50 million, will be released by\nSeptember 2001 upon the Government\u2019s maintaining compliance with the earlier met conditions,\nincluding the incentive subtranche conditions, and compliance with the following specific actions:\n(i)  Publishing of the Deregulation and Competition Task Force  findings of the review\nof  the  existing  laws,  regulations  and  decrees  that  are  inconsistent  with  the\nCompetition  Law  and  impose  high  compliance  costs  on  SMEs,  and\nrecommendations on simplifying and rationalization of the regulatory framework;\n(ii)  Liberalization of all license approvals and permits required of IP and IT other than\nthose required for environmental, moral, safety, security, or public health reasons\nby converting these into (a) the general class of licenses available to all interested\nimporters through simple registration; (b) appropriate duties or excise taxes;\n(iii)  Strengthening of the role of the Investment Board as a resource center and an\ninvestment promotion and facilitation body;\n(iv)  Issuance of an Investment Law consistent with the Investment Policy Statement;\nand\n(v)  Consolidation and streamlining of the SME technical/business support programs.\n118. The Government will monitor the implementation of the Program, and the Government and\nADB will undertake regular reviews of the implementation and assess the impact of all relevant\nsector reforms. To assist ADB\u2019s reviews, which are tentatively scheduled for October 2000, March\n2001 and July 2001 (prior to the second tranche release), the Government will provide relevant\ninformation through quarterly reports on the progress and impact of the policy reforms. At the end\nof the program period, the Government will submit a program completion report to ADB.\nVII. THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA. Promoting Deregulation and Competition\n119. The proposed TA is an integral part of the Program as it will help continue deregulation of\ntrade and industry. The TA\u2019s objective is to provide institutional and analytical support to the\nGovernment in reviewing and rationalizing the industrial regulatory system based on consistent\neconomic criteria for the assessment of net benefits of policy interventions. The TA will help the\nDeregulation and Competition Task Force and the Commission for Competition Supervision in\ntheir efforts to simplify the policy framework and promote competition.\n120. The scope of the TA will include (for details see Appendix 6):", "30\n(i) analytical and institutional support for development of\n(a)  economic criteria and framework to evaluate commercial laws, regulations,\nand policies that impede competition;\n(b)  guiding principles for public review of legislation; and\n(c)  detailed procedures for a systematic review of commercial regulations and\nlaws constraining competition, including preparation of clear and simple\nnontechnical  guidelines  and  checklists  for  the  development  and\nimplementation of recommendations of a public benefit review process;\n(ii) implementation of a public benefit review of selected industrial policy legislation\nand sectors based on the policy evaluation; and\n(iii)  capacity building through workshops, training exercises, and other assistance as\nneeded to strengthen the analytical and institutional capacity of the Deregulation\nand Competition Task Force and the Commission for Competition Supervision.\n121. The TA is estimated to cost $1.875 million equivalent, of which $1.22 million is the foreign\nexchange cost and $0.655 million is the local currency cost. The Government has asked ADB to\nfinance  $1.5  million  equivalent  to  cover  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $0.28 million\nequivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from the Asian\nCurrency Crisis Support Facility (ACCSF), funded by the Government of Japan. The Government\nwill provide $0.375 million equivalent to finance counterpart staff, office facilities, and workshops.\nAppendix 7 presents the detailed cost estimates and financing plan.\n122. The  TA  will  be  executed  by  the  Ministry  of  Industry  and  Trade  (MOIT)  and  will  be\nimplemented  over  12  months  starting  in  July  2000.  It  is  estimated  that  the  TA  will  require\n30 person-months of international consulting services. The international consultants will consist of\nexperts in industrial competition policy, trade and industry, and law. The international consultants\nwill associate with domestic consultants who will provide about 30 person-months of consulting\nservices in the same areas of expertise. The consultants will be selected in accordance with\nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for\nrecruitment of domestic consultants.\nB. Small and Medium Enterprise Development\n123. The objective of this TA is to develop a policy and institutional framework for SMEs in\naccordance  with  best  practice.  The  TA  will  assist  the  SME  Task  Force  in  formulating  and\nimplementing  a medium-term  SME  development  strategy,  and  will  contribute  to  the\nimplementation of the reform agenda under the Program, of which the TA is an integral part.\n124. The TA will focus on (see Appendix 8 for details):\n(i)  assessing the institutional mandate of concerned ministries and agencies, and\npreparing recommendations on policy measures to streamline and strengthen the\nagencies\u2019 respective functions and their coordination in the SME sector;\n(ii)  reviewing and evaluating existing SME programs for delivery of business services;\n(iii)  assessing the effectiveness of existing SME credit schemes and identifying ways\nto streamline and strengthen these while safeguarding existing viable commercial\nSME financial institutions;\n(iv)  monitoring the impact of the economic crisis on SMEs to ensure informed policy\nmaking; and\n(v)  building capacity and providing training to improve awareness of the best practices\nin the policy design and implementation.", "31\nThis will lead to the formulation and implementation of an SME development strategy and the\nadoption of market-oriented approaches in the provision of SME services based on best practice.\n125. The TA is estimated to cost $2.50 million equivalent, of which $1.61 million is the foreign\nexchange cost and $0.89 million equivalent is the local currency cost. The Government has asked\nADB  to  finance  $2.00  million  equivalent,  covering  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  and\n$0.39 million equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from\nthe Asian Currency Crisis Support Facility (ACCSF), funded by the Government of Japan. The\nGovernment will provide $0.50 million equivalent to finance counterpart staff, office facilities, and\nworkshops. Appendix 9 presents a detailed cost estimates and financing plan.\n126. The  TA  will  be  executed  by  SMOCSME  and  will  be  implemented  over  12  months\ncommencing  in  July  2000.  International  consultants  will  provide  about  40  person-months  of\nservices  and  will  include  experts  in  the  areas  of  SME  business  management  and  finance,\ninstitutional  development,  banking  and  law.  The  international  consultants  will  associate  with\ndomestic consultants, who will provide about 50 person-months of services in the areas of SME\nbusiness service provision, financing and banking, economics, and law. The consultants will be\nrecruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements\nsatisfactory to ADB for recruitment of domestic consultants.\nVIII. PROGRAM BENEFITS AND RISKS\nA. Benefits\n127. The policy and institutional reforms supported by the Program will promote competition\nand efficiency, reduce the costs of doing business in Indonesia, and contribute positively to the\nrestoration  of  economic  growth  and  development.  More  efficient  allocation  of  resources  is\nexpected to spur higher productivity and export growth across a wide range of industry sectors.\n128. A significant outcome is a transparent and predictable policy framework for trade and\nindustrial policy making and implementation. This will particularly benefit SMEs, which will face a\nmore predictable and less costly business environment. The more conducive policy environment\nunder the Program will promote broad-based growth in the real sector and will improve wage\nlevels and employment. An expanding SME sector will stimulate demand for labor from household\nand cottage industries where the poor are predominantly found in the urban manufacturing sector.\nTogether, these will promote structural transformation of the industrial sector and shifting of\nworkers from agriculture and nonwage employment to higher productivity, higher wage jobs in\nindustry and services. This growth in overall employment and the intersectoral shifting of workers\nwill reduce poverty. This effect will be reinforced by the expected expansion in exports. As\nIndonesia\u2019s manufacturing exports are labor intensive, export expansion will increase employment\nand incomes directly among households whose main asset is their labor, i.e., relatively poor\nhouseholds.\n129. Reduction of the remaining nontariff barriers and the provision of subsidies, and removal\nof protection will contribute to reducing opportunities for rent seeking and corruption. A further\nmajor expected benefit is the considerable simplification of business registration requirements that\nwill significantly reduce the opportunities for illegal payments to facilitate business.\n130. The  Government  will  benefit  from  improved  capabilities  in  industrial  and  SME  policy\nformulation,  while  stakeholders  will  have  more  effective  input  into  policy  design  and\nimplementation. The strengthening of key independent agencies such as the Commission for\nCompetition Supervision and reorganization of Customs administration will improve governance in\npublic sector institutions.", "32\n131. The magnitude of the anticipated benefits and positive impacts of the Program will be\nlinked  to  progress  in  macroeconomic  stabilization  measures,  financial  sector  and  banking\nreforms, State owned enterprises reforms and restructuring, and resolution of corporate debts.\nTaken  together,  these  reform  efforts  will  create  a  conducive  environment  for  sustainable\neconomic growth in Indonesia.\nB.  Risks\n132. The  Government\u2019s  management  of  the  reform  process  seeks  to  achieve  consensus\namong stakeholders, while maintaining the objectives and timetables of its structural reform\nprogram. The key concerns are the adverse transitional consequences of labor retrenchment,\nsubsidy reductions, and higher user fees that could provoke resistance from affected groups, slow\nthe pace of reforms, and jeopardize their sustainability. This risk is mitigated by the Government\u2019s\nstrong commitment to the reform agenda as well as by the provision of financial support by the\ninternational community. ADB funding for the Program will enable the Government to support\ntransfer programs that will help maintain consumption levels of groups most hard pressed by the\neconomic crisis. The risk of policy reversals is further mitigated by governance reforms that\nstrengthen the role of independent agencies such as BI, and the Commission for Competition\nSupervision. Finally, measures taken to reduce economic rent seeking are expected to strengthen\npublic confidence in the reform program.\n133. A second risk is the possibility that measures to rationalize subsidized credit policies will\nbe misconceived as reductions in credit and support for vulnerable sectors. This risk is mitigated\nby the Program and the associated TA, which support public consultation and the participation of\nSMEs in formulating more effective policies to promote the sector and meet its needs for business\nservices, credit, and capacity building.\n134. A third risk is that bank and corporate restructuring will proceed at a slow pace. This would\nmean  that  fewer  firms  would  be  able  to  take  advantage  of  the  opportunities  to  reposition\nthemselves provided by the improving industrial policy environment. This risk is mitigated by the\nGovernment\u2019s recent adoption of a more proactive strategy for industrial restructuring and by the\nsubstantial assistance being provided by the International Monetary Fund, ADB, World Bank, and\nbilateral funding agencies for bank and corporate restructuring.\nIX. ASSURANCES\n135. The Government has assured ADB that (i) the policies adopted and actions taken prior to\nthe date of the Loan Agreement, as described in the Development Policy Letter, will continue in\neffect for the duration of the Program; and (ii) it will promptly adopt the other policies and take the\nother actions included in the Program as specified in the Development Policy Letter and Loan\nAgreement to ensure that such policies and actions continue in effect for the duration of the\nProgram.", "33\nX.

The law distinguishes between modern markets and other traders such as wholesalers\nand retailers. Modern markets are defined in the Ministry of Industry and Trade\u2019s (MOIT) decree\nNo. 420/MPP/Kep/10/1997 to include plazas, malls, shopping centers, department stores, and\nsupermarkets with at least 2000 meters of floor space. To operate a modern market, the\ncompany must obtain a modern market license (izin usaha pasar modern or IUPM), while other\ntraders must obtain a trading license (surat izin usaha pasar or SIUP) from (MOIT).\n2. The  modern  market  retailer  must  first  apply  for  a  modern  market  license  from  the\ndirector  of  domestic  trade  at  MOIT.  The  granting  of  the  trade  license  is  conditional  upon\nobtaining many of the other licenses, permits, and/or letters listed below, including the Ministry\nof Cooperatives and Small-Scale Enterprise Development (MOCSED) approval of the retailer\u2019s\nSmall and medium enterprise partnership program (MOIT decree no. 107/MPP/Kep/2/1998).\nUnder decree No. 420/MPP/Keps/10/1997, the modern market retailer must submit an SME\npartnership program (known as program kemitraan usaha kecil) to the MOC for approval.\n3. Approval Letters. Letters of approval to operate a modern market in a region must be\nobtained from the regional office of MOIT, the provincial governor, and the city major or county\nhead.\n4. Location Licenses. A location license (or izin lokasi) is required from the national land\nagency, and a domicile license (or izin tempat usuaha) is required from the district office. A\npermit to use the company\u2019s building as a modern store (or izin mendirikan bangunan) is\nrequired from the city development council.\n5. Once the licenses, permits, and/or letters listed above are obtained and attached with\nthe IUPM application, MOIT will grant the applicant a modern market trade license. However,\nnumerous other licenses are required from different government agencies before the retailer\ncan establish and operate a modern market. These licenses include, but are not limited to:\n1. Own Building\n6. If the retailer constructs its own building to be used as a modern market, the retailer\nmust obtain the following licenses/permits:\n(i)  a  land  use  permit  (or  surat  izin  penunjukan  penggunaan  tanah)  from  the\nprovincial governor;\n(ii)  construction license (or izin penggunaan bangunan), from the city development\ncouncil. This license covers the construction of the office building, storage tank,\nsecurity office, warehouse, water treatment, and fences;\n(iii)  permit to use the building as a modern store (or izin mendirikan bangunan) from\nthe city development council; and\n(iv)  other building licenses required, including:\n(a)  installation of electricity license (or izin instalasi listrik) from the state-\nowned electricity company, PLN;", "52 Appendix 3, page 2\n(b)  power generator license (or izin genset) from PLN, and the provincial\ngovernment;\n(c)  sprinkler system license (or izin prinkler) from the state drinking water\ncompany, PDAM, and the fire department;\n(d)  telecommunications equipment license (or izin antene) from Telkom, the\nstate-owned telecommunications company;\n(e)  gas or izin gas;\n(f)  water system, water well license (or izin sumur bor) from PDAM;\n(g)  landscape  license  (or  izin  pertamanan)  from  the  section  of  public\ngardens, Public Works Department;\n(h)  sewerage license (or izin pembuangan limbah) from the hygiene section\nof the Department of Manpower;\n(i)  fire safety equipment license (or izin alat-alat pemadam kebakaran) from\nthe fire department;\n(j)  to operate a lift and escalator license (or izin lift and escalator) from PLN,\nand the Department of Manpower; and\n(k)  lightning rod license (or izin penangkal petir) from the hygiene section of\nthe Department of Manpower.\nIf the retailer uses a government-owned building for its modern market then a government\nbuilding permit (izin guna bangunan) is required from the local government.\n2. Selected Products and Services\n7. The retailer must obtain separate licenses to sell the following products and services:\n(i)  all kinds of fish (or izin penjualan ikan) from the Department of Fisheries;\n(ii)  vegetables and fruits (or izin penjualan sayur mayur) from the Department of\nAgriculture;\n(iii)  meat  (or  izin  penjualan  dagang)  from  the  Department  of  Agriculture  and\nDepartment of Health;\n(iv)  alcoholic  drinks  (or  izin  penjualan  minuman  keras)  from  the  Department  of\nJustice;\n(v)  wooden  handicrafts  (or  izin  menjual  cineramata)  from  the  Department  of\nForestry;\n(vi)  food court (or izin taman makan and minum) from the Department of Tourism;\n(vii)  playground arcade (or izin arena bermain) from the Department Tourism;", "53 Appendix 3, page 3\n(viii)  drugs,  both  prescription  and  over-the-counter  drugs  from  the  Department  of\nHealth and Department of Manpower; and\n(ix)  festival permit (or izin keramaian) from the Police Department for the opening\nceremony of the store.\n3.

These include:\n(i)  general human resource license or izin ketenagakerjaan;\n(ii)  lift and escalator;\n(iii)  electricity maintenance;\n(iv)  water sprinklers;\n(v)  sewerage;\n(vi)  hydrant hose;\n(vii)  building exists; and\n(viii)  expatriates.", "54 Appendix 4, page 1\nPOVERTY IMPACT ASSESSMENT\n1. The policy actions taken under the Industrial Competitiveness and Small and Medium\nEnterprise Development Program are directly and indirectly pro-poor. The importance of SMEs\nin terms of labor absorption relative to its contribution to value added indicates the need for\nenhancing the sector efficiency. Although no aggregate gender-based statistics exist for percent\nfemale ownership and management of SMEs, it is generally agreed that women are represented\nin  large  numbers  as  owners  and  managers,  as  well  as  workers.  SMEs,  rather  than  big\nenterprises, are the primary buyers of goods and services from the poor, and the vitality of the\nSME sector is essential for poverty reduction. The Program addresses some of the major\nrequirements for SME growth and development: (i) strengthening competition, (ii) investment\npromotion and trade facilitation, and (iii) promotion of SMEs.\n2. The Poverty Impact Assessment matrices are presented here together with a more\ndetailed discussion of the key conditionalities of the Program.\n1.  Policy  Area  IA:  Strengthening  competition:  Strengthen  the  legal\nenvironment to promote entry, exit, and resource mobility\n3. Passage of a competition/antimonopoly law is required to create a healthy competitive\nmarket by ending the sanction of monopolies, monopsonies, market control, and collaboration\namong business players that can result in unfair competition. An uncompetitive market results in\nhigher prices and restricted business and employment opportunities, and provides opportunities\nfor rent seeking. The law prevents big businesses from using their position to hinder small\nbusinesses. A fair business practice law limits vertical integration and market share, but must be\nsufficiently flexible to accommodate natural monopolies such as water supply and to avoid\npenalizing  efficient  businesses.  For  this  reason  an  independent  commission  is  required  to\ndetermine whether a company is engaged in a monopoly or not. Proper implementation of the\nlaw requires technical competence, integrity, and autonomy of members of the commission, and\ndetailed and unambiguous implementing regulations.\n4. As  a  well-functioning  market  allows  smooth  exit  as  well  as  entry  of  companies,\na bankruptcy law is essential to protect debtors from nuisance petitions, to protect creditors from\ndeterioration of assets when there is no hope for the successful operation of the company, and\nto ensure an equitable formal distribution to creditors. Under a bankruptcy law, employees are\nconsidered as creditors and their interest in back wages and severance pay is protected.\nA bankruptcy court is required to review the bankruptcy plan of the debtor or creditors to ensure\nthat is fair, equitable, and feasible. An effective and just insolvency law can contribute to\ninvestor confidence and accelerate resolution of private sector debt. This will help to revitalize\nthe  economy.  Mechanisms  for  voluntary  restructuring,  debt  resolution,  and  debt-equity\nconversions  by  holding  companies  promotes  exit  and  improves  resource  mobility  as  an\nalternative to liquidation thus enabling otherwise viable business concerns to continue.\n2.  Policy Area IB: Simplify and improve the regulatory framework across the\nindustry sector\n5. It is commonly agreed that the regulatory burden is one of the main impediments to SME\ndevelopment, particularly during this time of crisis when many small businesses are on the brink\nof closure. The efficiency of the SME sector is undermined by a cumbersome and complex\nlicensing system and by other regulations restricting domestic trade. These contribute to the\nhigh cost environment in which Indonesian business must operate and fall most heavily on\nSMEs. A trading firm, for example, would need to obtain 46 licenses from various levels of\ngovernment. The cost and hidden cost of compliance can amount to 2 percent of gross sales for", "55 Appendix 4, page 2\nlarge firms and 3 to 5 percent for small and medium-sized trading firms.1 Microenterprises are\nalso  burdened  by  such  regulation,  in  principle,  a  traditional  fishing  boat  would  require\n30 licenses before putting out to sea. The cost of formal or informal compliance with trade and\nlicensing regulations is a major business cost for SMEs. Removing these impediments would\nincrease SME competitiveness and reduce the uncertainty caused by bureaucratic interest in\ntheir affairs.\n3.  Policy Area IC: Promote domestic competition by removing price and entry\nbarriers to domestic trade and distribution\na.  Policy  Area  IC1:  Eliminate  producer  subsidies  and  improve\nefficiency of fertilizer supply and distribution to farmers.\n6. The present system of subsidizing the production of fertilizer obscures the amount of the\nsubsidy and creates disincentives for production efficiency. At times price controls have acted to\nthe disadvantage of farmers, as supplies of fertilizer have tended to dry up when fertilizer prices\nwere below border prices. The Indonesian farmer is well aware of the benefits of fertilizer to\nproduction and the gradual lifting of subsidized inputs over the 1980s did not result in a drop of\ndemand. Domestic rice prices are on par with world market prices, and actual fertilizer prices\npaid by farmers indicate that the subsidy provided has been captured within the distribution\nsystem.  The  use  of  price  controls  to  maintain  below  world  market  prices  has  resulted  in\nunofficial exports and domestic shortages. Finally removing the monopoly over distribution will\nlead to more efficient and timely distribution of fertilizer to farmers. To avoid disruption to the\nprovision of fertilizer, completion of these actions has been set for after the main planting\nseason.\nb. Policy Area IC2. Revoke the decrees issued in April 1998 that restrict\nforeign investment in selected sectors, equity, and location\n7. This  policy  area  (IC2)  revokes  the  Investment  Coordination  Board  (BKPM)  decree\nrestricting foreign investment in terms of sectors, equity, and location. The decree has its roots\nin  the  inward-looking  import-substitution,  infant  industry  protection,  foreign  exchange\nconservation policies of the late 1970s and early 1980s as well as distrust of market forces. The\nargument was that limiting foreign investment in all but the strongest and largest industries\nprotected Indonesian businesses from unfair competition. The Government attempted to replace\nthe flow of information and technology to small firms that would have resulted from foreign\nbusiness  linkages  with  Government-sponsored  training  and  marketing  support.  A  similar\nargument  was  used  to  protect  small  traditional  traders  from  modern  retailers  by  posing\nrestrictions on the location of modern supermarkets, by preventing combining wholesale and\nretail activities, as well as by dictating business linkages. Mistrust of market forces has led to\npolicies attempting to prevent large businesses from competing with small businesses while\nmandating relationships between them.\n8. These policies fail to recognize the benefits to trade and of the free flow of information\nand technology. By limiting foreign investment to large investments, and then under highly\nrestrictive circumstances, only particular industries have been able to benefit. Other sectors, the\ngarment, furniture, and silver industries in particular, have failed to develop to their potential\nbecause of restrictions on foreign-domestic business linkages. At present a foreign buyer is\nconsidered a foreign investor and must meet all foreign investment requirements to open a local\n                                                \n1\nTA 2705-INO: Trade and Industry Planning and Industry Formulation for Repelita VII, for $860,000, approved on\n16 December 1996.", "56 Appendix 4, page 3\noffice. Yet these sectors would benefit from partnerships with small foreign businesses providing\nmainly market information and market linkages.\n4.  Policy Area ID: Strengthen international competition by reducing tariff and\nnontariff barriers\na.  Policy  area  ID1.  Increase  international  competition  and  improve\nefficiency in trade and industry sectors by reducing the distortion in\nthe antiexport bias due to high and variable import tariffs\n9. This  policy  seeks  to  accelerate  proposed  tariff  reductions  under  the  World  Trade\nOrganization\u2019s agreement and explicit outlines the steps required to reaching this goal. High\nimport taxes increase the cost of goods produced for the domestic market and reduce the\ncompetitiveness of most export commodities. As the current foreign exchange regime provides\nmarket-based protection to domestic industries against imports, acceleration of tariff reduction\nminimizes any potential negative impact of increased foreign competition while lowering input\ncosts for domestic industries stimulating growth and employment.\nb.  Policy area ID2, 3 and 4: Strengthening competition: (ID2) Remove\nthe Agency for National Logistics (BULOG) Import Monopoly, (ID3)\nReduce the list of importer-producer (IP) and importer-trader (IT)\nlicenses and (ID4) Government to liberalize all IP and IT licenses\n10. This policy is aimed at speeding up the process of reducing non-tariff barriers (NTBs) to\ninternational trade such as import licensing and quantitative restrictions. With the development\nof a private and competitive network of traders throughout the archipelago, BULOG is no longer\nneeded  to  secure  the  supply  of  basic  food  commodities  such  as  rice.  While  BULOG  will\ncontinue to play a role in providing national food security, it no longer needs to do so by acting\nas sole importer. NTBs were heavily used during the late 1970s and early 1980s as part of a\ndevelopment  strategy  that  sought  to  conserve  foreign  exchange  and  provide  stimulus  to\ndomestic  industries.  While  the  Indonesian  development  strategy  has  since  turned  outward\ntoward  a  trade-oriented  global  market,  NTBs  are  no  longer  an  appropriate  part  of  its\ndevelopment  strategy  and,  instead,  enable  rent  collection  by  companies  holding  sole  or\nrestricted licenses and undue protection to particular industries. While prior to the crisis there\nmight have been a concern that some industries may be adversely affected by competition from\nimports, this concern should be mitigated by the natural protection offered these industries by\nthe fall of the rupiah. NTBs on basic food stuffs such as sugar, garlic, and soybeans and other\nitems  such  as  plastics  result  in  higher  consumer  prices.  The  large  number  of  NTBs  on\nintermediate manufacturing goods also increases production costs, affects the competitiveness\nof downstream industry, and reduces opportunities for growth and employment. This effect will\nbe removed by the conversion of IP and IT licenses into transparent and nondiscriminatory\ninstruments such as general licenses, or conversion into duties or excise taxes thus removing\nrent-seeking opportunities. Licenses required for environmental or health considerations will be\nmade more transparent.\n5.  Policy area IIA: Improve investment policy framework and practice\n11. The underlying legal framework for Indonesian foreign investment policies is the view\nthat the function of foreign investment was to supplement domestic investment and was to be\nphased down over time to balance the need for capital against the threat of foreign domination.\nThis has resulted in policies that have rationed foreign investment opportunities by sector,\nlocation, and size of investment. In addition, the implementation of foreign investment screening\nand approvals has been subject to complex and somewhat uncertain procedures including", "57 Appendix 4, page 4\ngranting of tax holidays. The net effect has been to reduce Indonesia\u2019s attractiveness to quality\nforeign investment and cluster investment in capital intensive industries and those enjoying\nsome degree of protection. Limits on the duration of foreign investment licenses have had a\nnegative  impact  on  investors\u2019  decisions  regarding  upgrading  of  technology,  decreasing\nopportunities for workers to learn new skills. Redirecting the Investment Board from a regulatory\nbody allocating investment opportunities to an investment facilitation role will encourage foreign\ninvestment and reduce rent-seeking activities. Reorienting investment policies and opening\nforeign  investment  in  almost  all  economic  sectors  will  produce  benefits  beyond  capital\nmobilization  to  include  access  and  exposure  to  improved  technology,  business  skills,  and\nopportunities to SMEs that have been shut out of foreign investment, thus restricting their\naccess to capital, technology, and markets. Mandated business partnerships between small and\nlarge enterprises that have been in place since the late 1970s have failed to bring about a\ndeepening of linkages between large and small industries. While some large industries have\ntaken on a social mission to develop small industries, many others put off by the rigidities of the\nsystem have preferred to adopt an arm\u2019s length relationship. Others have been able to exploit\nopportunities  provided  to  small  firms  by  setting  up  their  own  small  establishments.  These\narrangements have done little to promote healthy business links between large and small firms\nand may, in fact, be counterproductive to the development of these relationships.\n6.  Policy  area  IIB:  Streamline  duty  drawback  procedures  and  improve\ntransparency\n12. This policy is intended to improve the efficiency with which exemptions or rebates on\nimport duties are provided to manufacturers of exported goods. The draw-back facility serves\nindirect exporters, generally SMEs that have subcontracting arrangements with large exporters.\nEstablishing a timetable for tariff reduction consistent with the Association of Southeast Asian\nNations tariff reduction agreements ensures the facility is available to the extent that it is\nneeded.\n7.  Policy  area  IIC:  Investment  Promotion  and  Trade  Facilitation:  Facilitate\ntrade through improved customs procedures\n13. The liberalization of the foreign trade regime has not been matched by institutional\nstrengthening of the customs and port systems. These functions had been devolved to the\nSociete Generale de Surveillance (SGS) for 10 years prior to 1997 for preshipment inspections.\nIn April 1997, Customs control reverted to Indonesian authorities. The SGS arrangement was\nsuccessful in raising import tax revenues. However, no provisions for transfer of technology or\ndevelopment of customs systems were made. At the end of 10 years, Customs was left with\nantiquated systems, no experience in import valuation, and poor import tracking capability.\nReversion  to  Indonesian  based  customs  has  resulted  in  delays  and  additional  costs  to\nimporters, and delays in servicing and clearance has put heavy pressure on port areas. Import\nclearance time has increased from nearly two days to nearly two weeks, which places an undue\nburden on importers and affects the efficiency of industries that depend on trade. There are few\neconomic activities that do not rely on some import component in their operations. Creating an\nefficient customs and port authority system is therefore critical for expanding international trade\nwhich in turn will create demand for goods and services, and increase the opportunities for the\npoor.", "58 Appendix 4, page 5\n8.  Policy  area  IIIA:  Broaden  participation  of  SMEs  in  policy  making  and\nimplementation,  improve  interagency  coordination,  and  broaden\nparticipation of SMEs in policy making and implementation processes.\n14. The Government system for improving SME technology and human resources requires\noverhaul. The National SME Policy Workshop held in December 1999 at Jakarta identified\nseveral constraints that are addressed under this policy area. There is a great deal of overlap in\nthe support provided by various technical Government agencies, (the Ministries of Industry and\nTrade, Cooperatives and SMEs, Manpower, Agriculture, and Home Affairs, and the Family\nPlanning Agency) all of which have their own SME support program. Better coordination is\nneeded as well as a system for integrating SME needs into policy decision making. Government\nprograms promote technology and skills based on a top down assessment of SME needs.\nThere is no system for incorporating SME inputs in policy making and implementation of support\nto SMEs, with the result that the policies are sometimes inconsistent such as promoting the use\nof particular imported technologies while imposing heavy import taxes.\n9.  Policy Area IIIB: Improve efficiency of financial intermediation\n15. Directed  subsidized  credit  lending  schemes  have  been  a  source  of  frustration  as\nchanneling banks bear responsibility for loan repayment, borrowers experience hidden costs\nand delays in accessing the credit, and prospective borrowers perceive that access to credit has\nbeen captured by better connected borrowers. Directed credit schemes have been plagued by\npoor repayment performance linked to rent-seeking opportunities by banking and Government\nofficials and other credit delivery problems. As a result some borrowers were unable or did not\nfeel obligated to repay. Responsibility for loan repayment and lack of familiarity of the bank with\nthe intended beneficiary group has contributed to the capture of directed credit by non-intended\nbeneficiaries known to the bank. While directed credit may continue to serve as an important\npolicy  tool  for  the  Government,  its  channeling  terms  and  availability  must  be  clear,  and\nusefulness  demonstrated.  The  number  of  schemes  should  be  streamlined  and  terms  and\nconditions standardized and known. It is important to reduce the incentives for rent-seeking\nbehavior or capture by other consumer groups. For this reason the gap between the rate for\nsubsidized lending and commercial lending should be narrowed and appropriate risk-sharing\nincentives established as this will reduce the scope for informal charges, the incentives for\ndiversion of lending to other borrowers, and improve the effectiveness of targeting and delivery.\nNarrowing  the  gap  requires  establishing  an  appropriate  benchmark  to  avoid  inflation  of\noutstanding debt obligations. In addition, a transparent mechanism for assessing subsidies is\nrequired  to  allocate  resources  and  subsidies  across  sectors  and  to  ensure  appropriate\nbudgetary allocation. Bringing SME credit into the budget and the use of public audit will help\nensure that funds are used in an accountable fashion and that policymakers are able to assess\ntrade-offs and optimal levels of funding.\n16. The need to improve access to capital and the problem of the high cost of capital has\nlong been recognized by the Government as an impediment to the growth of SMEs. Most SME\nStakeholders agree that they are constrained by low access to information and services from\nfinancial institutions, complicated and unclear procedures, and high interest rates. There is now\na gap between the SMEs seeking credit and the financial institutions that would like to serve\nthem.  Policies  to  improve  the  operations  of  small  business  programs  and  encourage  the\nextension of successful programs will help close this gap. The Government should encourage\nthe development of institutions that specialize in SMEs. The unintended consequence of the\nCredit for Small Enterprises lending requirement of all commercial banks is that some financial\ninstitutions have been forced to lend in areas where they lacked advantage and expertise. The\nresulting difficulty in delivering expected services has contributed to the perception of low", "59 Appendix 4, page 6\naccess to financial services. As Bank Rakyat Indonesia has been successful in demonstrating\nthat  rural  banking  and  small  business  credit  programs  can  be  profitable,  it  should  be\nencouraged to build on this strength and to serve as a model for other commercial institutions\nseeking to specialize in SME lending.\n10.  Policy  area  IIIC:  Promotion  of  SMEs:  Promote  commercially  oriented\ntechnical and business support for SMEs\n17. A review is needed of the existing SME programs to reduce the overlap and duplication\nin the support provided by various technical Government agencies. Training plans are based on\ntop down perceptions of required skills rather than beneficiary demand. Outreach is poor.\nTraining and support are to be provided to businesses already under departmental guidance or\nthat are already successful. Technical and business support activities should be commercialized\nto ensure these activities are demand driven.2 This does not imply that 100 percent cost\nrecovery is required but there should be some contribution on the part of recipients who are\nexpected to profit from the services. Increasing beneficiary contributions enable the Government\nto stretch tight development resources and to extend their outreach, particularly outside of Java\nwhere the less developed communications network increases the cost of service delivery. SMEs\nhave indicated their interest in expanding technical service centers3 to smaller industrial centers.\nThe  Government  should  avoid  competing  with  private  sector  resources  and  should  take\nadvantage  of  private  sector  capacity  to  deliver  support  services.  Where  possible  the\nGovernment should commercialize and privatize existing ownership in technical and business\nsupport activities.\n                                                \n2  If business is willing to pay for services, their relevance is assured.\n3  Proceedings of the National SME Policy Workshop; December 8-9, 1999, Jakarta.", "60 Appendix 4, page 7\nPolicy Area IA:\nStrengthening Competition:\nStrengthen the legal environment to promote entry, exit, and resource mobility\nDirect Indirect Macro Non-Poor\nAccess for Poor More opportunities to More opportunities to\nprovide goods and provide goods and\nservices services\nEmployee wages are Creditors assets are\nprotected under protected through\nbankruptcy laws reorganization or can\nrecover part of their\nassets for new\nproductive investment\nthrough liquidation\nPrices Lower prices Lower prices\nCrucial Competition creates business opportunities and lowers consumer prices.\nAssumptions: Members independent commission are independent, honest, and technically competent.\nCommercial courts judges understand modern bankruptcy laws financial concepts.\nCommercial courts can implement favorable liquidations (i.e., no fire sales).\nNet Impact: Indirect, positive\nNarrative: Strengthening the legal framework to promote competition enhances market access, market\nefficiency, and greater employment opportunities.
