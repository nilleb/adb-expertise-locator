INTRODUCTION\n1. The Central Asian Republics (CARs) today face serious environmental problems that\nhave  a  distinct  regional  character.  The  necessity  to  address  these  problems  has  been\nrecognized and a number of initiatives have been taken. A regional initiative is considered highly\ndesirable to establish a firm foundation for taking further necessary action in a coordinated way.\nA regional technical assistance (TA) is proposed for preparing the first regional environmental\naction plan  (REAP) in Central Asia in a highly participatory and well-coordinated way.1\nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. The  CARs  face  daunting  constraints  to  economic  development  as  a  result  of\noverexploitation of environmental resources.2 Since the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991,\nthe newly independent republics in the region have shared the urgent need to develop new\ninstitutions, policies, and skills to function as a state\u2014a process made more difficult by the\nsevere  economic  contraction  associated  with  that  breakup.  Markets  for  raw  materials  and\nindustrial  products  evaporated  quickly.  Real  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  fell  by  30-50\npercent, inflation reached over 1,000 percent per year, and unemployment soared. Prior to the\nRussian economic crisis in 1998, the former Soviet republics had begun to recover from the\neconomic downturn of the early 1990s. Inflation had been reduced with monetary stabilization\nprograms and currency controls, GDP was rising, and production and trade were gradually\nrecovering. Privatization of major industries and services has provided a foundation for new\ninvestment and economic activity.  But appropriate attention has not been paid to the quality of\nthe environment and to the sustainable exploitation of natural resources. That problem is more\nor less similar in all CARs.  There is political agreement to address common concerns and\ntransboundary issues through regional cooperation.\n3. The environmental authorities of the CARs have clearly understood the importance of\nenvironmental  information  in  economic  development.  The  necessity  of  addressing  these\nproblems through regional cooperation was recognized in 1993 with the establishment of the\ninternational  fund  for  Aral  Sea  rehabilitation,  and  an  intergovernmental  commission  for\nsustainable development. The agreement on cooperation in the field of environment protection\nand rational use of nature was signed in 1998. The same year the five Central Asian countries\nmade a joint statement on the matter at the Fourth Ministerial Conference on Environment for\nEurope,  in  Aarhus.  The  Aarhus  initiative  included,  among  other  issues,  a  new  approach\n(Infoterra) to assist countries in transition to establish a national environmental information\nservice, and to exchange sound environmental information among partners at the national level\nand among countries. At the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific\n(ESCAP) meeting on regional ecological cooperation in Tehran in February 2000, the five\nministers of environment reaffirmed their commitment to the needs of a REAP. In 1999 and\nearly 2000, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) carried out fact-finding for a regional TA to\nstrengthen  environmental  management  in  line  with  the  REAP.  In  March  2000,  the  United\nNations  Environment  Programme  (UNEP)  appointed  a  Central  Asian  task  force  and\ncommissioned a fact-finding mission to the region. The UNEP mission confirmed the need for\nREAP. The proposed regional development was then discussed in June 2000 in a meeting of\nthe five ministers of environment, in a workshop in August 2000 in Bangkok, and will be further\ndeliberated on at the Ministerial Conference on Environment and Development in Asia and\nPacific in Japan in September 2000, and in the Interim Meeting on Environment for Europe in\n                                                          \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 26 January 2000.\n2  Asian Development Bank. Interim Central Asian Assistance Plan 2000\u20132002. May 2000.", "2\nOctober 2000, in Almaty, Kazakhstan. UNEP has taken a lead role in  regional capacity building\nfor environmental management in Central Asia. The partnership with ADB will generate synergy\nfor regional cooperation between governments and aid agencies. The governments of the CARs\nhave requested assistance in preparing a REAP.\n4. Some other groups active in the environment sector in the subregion include European\nUnion, Finland, Japan, Netherlands, Switzerland, and United States. A coordinated subregional\napproach to capacity building and other forms of environmental assistance by those nations and\naid  agencies  is  essential  to  optimize  assistance  efficiency  and  effectiveness,  as  well  as\nenvironmental benefit. A dynamic and responsive subregional program based on the REAP is\nproposed to accomplish these and accelerate efforts for environmental improvement such as\ncleaner production, policy formulation, planning, institution building, and financing.\n5. In early 1994, ADB began  baseline studies of the state of the environment, starting in\nKazakhstan, then Kyrgyz Republic and Uzbekistan,  in close cooperation with  the ministries or\nstate committees for environmental protection. Those  profiles were  published in 1998. In 2000,\nADB published the environment profile for Tajikistan. All these country-level information points\nto  the  fact  that  accomplishing  environmental  improvements  requires  capacity  to  manage\nstrategies and make decisions on environment protection and natural resources management.\nThe  available  information  needs  to  be  converted  into  action  plans,  to  support  sustainable\neconomic development.\n6. The environment ministers of the CARs have met biannually since 1998.  The summits\nhave reaffirmed their commitment to environmental cooperation as evidenced by establishment\nof a regional environment center (REC 1999), and preparation of an outline REAP (June 2000).\nThe outline REAP was essentially a compilation of outdated national environment action plans\n(NEAPs). In February 2000, the ministers met in Tehran, and requested assistance from funding\norganizations in preparing a comprehensive REAP incorporating updated information from the\nnational level and focusing on necessary actions that require a coordinated, regional approach.\nREAP would be established in collaboration between the governments, aid agencies, and UN\nagencies.3  In  June  2000,  the  ministries  approved  the  REAP  concepts,  procedures,  and\nschedule.\n7.  The five Central Asian countries involved are Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan,\nTurkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. ADB recently financed three TAs for environmental capacity\nbuilding in the region.4 In 2000 ADB initiated a regional TA to address concerns about the\nmountain  ecosystems,  and  an  advisory  TA  for  capacity  building  in  Kazakhstan.  Those\napproaches have been designed in line with the NEAP, most of which were prepared in the\nearly 1990s to mid-1990s and are being updated by the countries. The updated NEAPs will be\nthe bases in preparing the REAP.\n8. A particular concern in development planning is the shortage of  data and information to\nprovide knowledge-based planning and management of the environment and natural resources.\nLack of such information is a significant regional problem and barrier to sustainable economic\ngrowth. The cited national profiles at the level of countrywide summaries, and the Environmental\n                                                          \n3  Summary of Environmental Management in Central Asia, compiled by UNEP/EAP\u2013AP, Bangkok, May 2000.\n4  TA 2397-KGZ: Strengthening Environmental Institutions and Improving Procedures for EIA, for $556,000,\napproved on 13 September 1995; TA 2934-KGZ: Environmental Monitoring and Management Capacity Building,\nfor  $598,000,  approved  on  11  December  1997;  TA  2859-UZB: Strengthening of Institutions Engaged in\nEnvironmental Protection, for $675,000, approved on 8 September 1997.", "3\nand Natural Resources Information Network (ENRIN) of the UNEP Global Resource Information\nDatabase (GRID), support the formulation of an information framework that is dynamic and\ndepends  on  timely  input  of  environmental  information.  Access  to  and  familiarity  with  that\ndatabase may facilitate efficient planning for decision makers in the CARs, for updating and\npresenting of the national and regional environmental conditions, and consequent updating of\naction plans. Lack of financial and institutional capacity has to be addressed by capacity-\nbuilding development cooperation to permit preparation and implementation of national and\nregional plans.\n9. The current capabilities of the environment ministries and other focal point  agencies\ninvolved  are  limited,  as  there  is  continuous  lack  of  financing  in  implementing  of  urgent\nenvironmental plans. All recipient agencies have the necessary government organizations in\nplace, but training is needed to address the requirements resulting from the transition to a\nmarket economy. Regional cooperation has been clearly acknowledged as a tool to address the\ncapacity gap as well as transboundary environmental concerns. UNEP has prepared a project\nproposal, which aims at preparing the REAP through similar activities as those identified during\nfact-finding by ADB, proposing comanagement and offering cofinancing.  Pooling the resources\nof ADB and of UNEP and the regional offices of the United Nations Development Programme\n(UNDP)  will  accomplish  synergism  and  enhance  efficiency  and  effectiveness  in  delivering\nassistance.  The  national  experts  and  representatives  of  CARs  expressed  support  for  the\nmerged effort during the REAP workshop in Bangkok in August 2000.  Cofinancing with UNEP\nwould be parallel, partly in kind and partly in cash.\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.  Objective\n10. The objective of the TA is to strengthen regional cooperation among the five CARs in the\narea of improved environmental management, by supporting the process of and the mechanism\nfor REAP development and implementation.   \nB.   Scope\n11. To achieve the objective, the TA will focus on both the process and the product, by\ndeveloping the mechanism and building the institutional capacity to prepare and implement an\nambitious but feasible regional environment action planning process; and preparing of the first\nREAP as the starting point for national actions, which will lead to effective regional cooperation.\nAccordingly, the TA includes the following:\n(i)  prepare a REAP with close participation of the national institutions in the CARs,\ninvolving the following: (a) drawing up of a plan and guidelines for the REAP,\nincluding the methodology and procedures to be followed, (b) training workshops\nto prepare for developing the REAP,  (c) completion of the first draft in April 2001,\n(d) initial review in May 2001, and (e) a high-level workshop in June 2001 to\ndisseminate  the  major  elements  of  the  REAP  and  prepare  for  initiating\nimplementation;\n(ii)  help to establish regional environment networks, including the mechanism and\nprocedures for exchange of information among the CARs;", "4\n(iii)  establish the necessary mechanism (including identifying the focal points) for\nimplementing regional programs in water resources, air quality, land degradation,\nwaste management, and mountain ecosystems;\n(iv)  help  develop  an  overall  program  for  regional  cooperation,  including  other\nimportant environmental issues and areas; and\n(v)  provide support for capacity building by (a) training the staff in organizing and\nmanaging  environmental  data  networks,  (b)  establishing  pilots  in  each\nparticipating  country  to  initiate  networking,  (c)  preparing  various  required\nmanuals in English and Russian to implement the REAP, and (d) undertaking on-\nthe-job training of the counterpart staff involved in the TA.\n12. A series of regional-level workshops will be held on each key issue, encouraging a\ntransparent participatory process. The consolidated REAP will be reviewed by CAR experts,\nnongovernment  organizations,  and  representatives  of  governments.  Aid  agencies  and\ngovernments active in CARs will be invited to the workshops. A high-level workshop with\nministers and senior aid representatives in June 2001 may be followed by further tuning of the\nREAP in August 2001. The TA framework is in Appendix 1.\n13. To  facilitate  environmental  networking,  the  materials  prepared  for  the  international\nmeetings, including the updated environmental data for each country, will be offered to the\nENRIN  network  for  public  access.  Three  persons  from  each  country  will  be  trained  in\nmaintaining,  updating,  and  utilizing  environmental  data  networks,  to  provide  assistance  to\nstrategy-level decision makers in environmental management. The training will consist of four\nweeks on-the-job training in Central Asia. A pilot working station with two computers and\nperipherals will be established in each participating country, in cooperation with the scientific\ninformation center, which is the designated node of the CARs.\nC.   Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n14. The total cost of the RETA is estimated at $600,000 equivalent (Appendix 2), of which\n$500,000 equivalent is to be financed by the Government of Finland, on a grant basis, and\nadministered by ADB through the channel financing agreement, and $100,000 by UNEP, in the\nform of parallel financing. The assistance will cover Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan,\nTurkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.\nD.  Implementation Arrangements\n15. ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA, which will be implemented in close\ncooperation  with  the  UNEP  task  force  for  the  REAP,  the  national  governments,  and  the\nIntergovernmental Sustainable Development Commission of the Central Asian countries, as well\nas the offices of UNDP. A detailed work program will be agreed upon at inception. Following the\ninception meeting, ADB, CARs, and UNEP will exchange letters of agreement detailing the\nimplementation  arrangements,  respective  responsibilities  and  schedules,  and  exchange  of\ninformation.\n16. The central points for implementation  will be the environment ministry in each CAR. The\nnational focal points appointed by the ministers of environment and the international agencies\n                                                          ", "5\ninvolved  will  form  a  steering  committee.  Each  focal  point  will  be  responsible  for  overall\ncoordination of the work plan in its country, and take the lead in one of the identified key\nenvironment issues.\n17. The TA will be implemented over 11 months, from September 2000. It provides 10\nperson-months (2-3 visits) of international and 25 person-months of CAR national consulting\nservices. An international consultant will be recruited by ADB, and CAR national consultants will\nbe employed by UNEP in consultation with ADB,5 all in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on\nthe Use of Consultants, and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB.  The terms of reference\n(TOR) is attached as Appendix 3.\n18. ADB will coordinate the TA at the national level, in consultation with UNEP. The ADB\nresident missions in CARs will be invited  to  the workshops and other activities,  to generate\nawareness about the program. ADB, in consultation with UNEP and the CAR governments, will\nmonitor and periodically review the progress reports and progress of TA implementation through\na review of monthly and other progress reports, and participation in at least three review\nmissions.\n19. There will be three core reports: (i) inception report two months after starting the work,\n(ii) interim report five months from the start, and (iii) draft final report in nine months. The final\nreport should include the REAP. Other reports are monthly progress reports, documents of each\nof the four workshops/meetings, and manuals or handbooks in the use of data networking\nequipment and software. The reports will be in English and Russian.\n20. ADB will be responsible for procuring equipment and training materials that it is financing\nunder the TA. ADB may, however, agree on arrangements with the participating governments or\nUNEP,  or  as  otherwise  appropriate,  to  carry  out  procurement  satisfactory  to  ADB  and  in\naccordance with ADB's Guidelines for Procurement.\nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION\n21. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB\nadministering technical assistance to the Central Asian Republics in an amount not exceeding\nthe equivalent of $500,000, to be financed by the Government of Finland on a grant basis, for\nthe purpose of the Regional Environmental Action Plan in Central Asia, and hereby reports such\naction to the Board.\n                                                          \n5  This approach has been demonstrated to be effective and efficient in previous cooperative TAs with UNEP in the\nGreater Mekong Subregion.", "Appendix 1\n6\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK\nDesign Performance Monitoring Assumptions\nSummary Targets Mechanisms and Risks\nSector Goal\nEnvironmentally Institutional capacity to Review and compare Commitment to transition to\nsustainable decision plan and implement new and existing market economy and\nmaking for economic environmental systems for resource willingness to resolve\ngrowth in Central Asia management for management transboundary concerns of\ndecision making environmental management\nPurpose\nPrepare a regional First REAP prepared, Monitor functioning of Commitment of developing\nenvironmental action regional information regional and member countries (DMCs) to\nplan (REAP) in exchange, operational international share information\ncooperation with connections to relevant information networks\nUnited Nations data networks\nEnvironment\nProgramme\n(UNEP)/United\nNations Development\nProgramme (UNDP),\nin six international\nmeetings\nObtain regional Agreeable  strategies for Monitor changes in Willingness to adopt new\nagreement on a different environmental policies and regional practices in managing\nregional environmental sectors considered in management natural resources\nstrategy regional and national systems\nmeetings\nOutputs\nRegional strategies for Changes in Through annual DMC Institutional and financial\nsustainable national/regional reports capabilities to maintain the\nmanagement of environmental strategies environmental management\nnatural resources and beginning 2002 Post-project\nenvironmental monitoring of Maintenance modernization,\nmanagement Regional environmental information and and updating of data networks\nInformation and action plan drafted technology exchange\ntechnology Poor coordination between aid\ncommunication system Operational information Observing the agencies will be addressed by\non regional exchange in 2002 formation of new strengthening the exchange of\nenvironmental activities and information.\nmanagement shared Improved environmental development\ndevelopment and cooperation\nmanagement catalyzed\nInputs\nConsultants: Consultant (10 person- Performance reports Competent team leader\nTeam Leader months  international, 25 Meeting and\nRegional Consultants person-months workshop reports, Appropriate expertise in Central\nregional) final reports Asian Republics (CARs) and\nenvironmental strategies\nMeetings: Effective cooperation Monitoring progress\nDMC Ministers and between national focal in preparing the Can obtain data and conduct\nother experts points REAP fieldwork in cooperation with\nOther Aid Agencies the counterparts\nMonitoring the\nupdating of national Lack of financing\nenvironmental action\nplans Willingness to pool  resources\n(Reference in text: page 4, para. 12)", "Appendix 2\n7\nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN\n($\u2019000)\nItem ADB UNEP          Total\nFinancinga Financing           Cost\n1.
