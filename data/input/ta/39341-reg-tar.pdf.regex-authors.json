This  regional  technical  assistance  (TA)  builds  on  the  experience  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) in implementing its Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). Gaps \nbetween ADB\u2019s policy and national laws and procedures, including inadequate resources within \nADB and governments, pose the most critical challenges to effective policy implementation. \nADB resource input is required at two levels to support government efforts: (i) developing \nnational  policy,  including  improvements  to  systems  and  procedures;  and  (ii)  providing \ncompetent  staff  to  support  loan  preparation  and  implementation  both  within  ADB  and  the \ngovernments.  The  TA  fact-finding  mission,1  consultations  with  resident  mission  staff  and \nHeadquarters  staff  helped  refine  and  finalize  the  TA  activities.  The  resident  mission  staff \nparticularly in Bangladesh and Viet Nam, requested further support for training activities. Due to \nbudget limitation, the TA cannot accommodate additional training. However, it is expected that \nthe resettlement specialists to be fielded in the resident missions will play an active role in \ntraining. \n \n2.  An Operations Evaluation Department study concluded that insufficient supervision by \nADB impedes satisfactory delivery of safeguards under the Involuntary Resettlement Policy.2  It \nalso stated that ADB technical assistance (TA) on involuntary resettlement, although relatively \nsmall, has had a positive impact. Thus, it recommended enhanced TA support.  \n \n3.  To address the pressing need of lack of staff capacity within resident missions, the main \nactivity under the TA is to support the placement of resettlement specialists in resident missions \nin Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Viet Nam for 3 years.3 The country directors in these countries \nhave expressed strong support for augmenting resources in the resident missions. The TA will \nalso  provide  support  for  (i)  capacity  development  to  selected  agencies  in  Indonesia  and \nPakistan, and (ii) specialist support to the Government of Viet Nam to support its efforts to \nrevise  the land  law.  Bangladesh and  Viet  Nam  have  a  large  infrastructure  portfolio  under \nimplementation and in the pipeline. In Indonesia, the resident mission has been extending the \nservices of a staff consultant recruited in 2006 on a yearly basis. 4\n \n4.  The  TA  will  also  support  a  request  from  the  Government  of  Viet  Nam  to  finance \ninternational  experts  to  increase  efforts  to  review  and  revise  Viet  Nam\u2019s  land  law.  The \nGovernment of Viet Nam is facing increasing demands from the public to be paid adequate \ncompensation  for  lands  acquired,  and  local  governments  are  facing  difficulty  in  accessing \nreplacement  lands.  The  Office  of  the  Government  has  requested  the  Ministry  of  Natural \nResources and Environment (MONRE) to prepare recommendations for revising the land law, \nand studies are already under way. In Indonesia, the National Planning and Development \nAgency, BAPPENAS (Monitoring and Evaluation of Development Funding), stressed the need \nfor \u201cquality at entry\u201d, early identification of land acquisition and resettlement impacts, and timely \nimplementation.  The  Government  of  Indonesia  has  recommended  capacity  development \n                                                 \n1 A fact-finding mission was fielded on 22 October\u20132 November 2007 to Indonesia and Viet Nam. The mission \ncomprised R. Jayewardene, Senior Social Development Specialist/Mission Leader, Regional and Sustainable \nDevelopment Department (RSDD), Environment and Social Safeguards Division (RSES).  \n2  ADB. 2006. Special Evaluation Study on Involuntary Resettlement.    \n3  Resident missions in Cambodia, People\u2019s Republic of China, India, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Nepal, \nPakistan, and Sri Lanka already have resettlement specialists.   \n4  Implementation of the TA will not commence until no-objection letters have been received by the respective \ngovernments. \n ", "2    \nsupport  to  be  provided  at  the  regional  level.  The  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in \nAppendix 1.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n5.  The absence of dedicated qualified staff means that ADB engagement with executing \nagencies and other stakeholders on Involuntary Resettlement is at best intermittent except \nthrough TA grants, intermittent orientation seminars by the Environment and Social Safeguards \nDivision  (RSES),  and  project-specific  capacity  development.  Lack  of  ADB  resettlement \nspecialists at field level, and the inability of executing agencies to engage with staff on a \nfrequent basis, were cited as key drawbacks during the regional workshop held in Manila in \n2005.6 In contrast, the World Bank has three social safeguard specialists in Viet Nam and at \nleast two each in its Bangladesh and Indonesia country offices.    \n \n6.  The TA countries (Bangladesh, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Viet Nam) increasingly face the \nchallenge of rationalizing development demands and land scarcity. Much publicity surrounds \nsuch investment initiatives in emerging economies such as the People\u2019s Republic of China, \nIndia, and Viet Nam. Land acquisition is devolved under the purview of provinces and districts in \nPakistan, Indonesia, and Viet Nam. Efforts to improve resettlement implementation in these \ncountries must focus on the relevant decentralized agencies. \n \n7.  During TA fact-finding in Viet Nam, MONRE and the Ministry of Finance confirmed that \nthe Government of Viet Nam urgently needs to address land acquisition and resettlement issues \nsatisfactorily, and reduce dissatisfaction among affected groups. The Government of Viet Nam \nhas begun a process of reviewing current laws and procedures, including property valuation. \nMONRE confirmed that its staff in the provinces and districts has limited capacity to implement \nthe existing provisions, particularly in more remote locations.  \n \n8.   Indonesia has an expropriation law but it was only invoked once in 1972. Complex land \nlaws,  coupled  with  decentralized  decision-making,  have  precluded  needed  investment  in \ninfrastructure. During the Infrastructure Summit held in Jakarta in January 2005, land acquisition \nand  resettlement  was  one  of  the  key  issues  raised  by  BAPPENAS.  Considerable \nimplementation  delays  and  less-than-optimal  project  benefits  are  caused  by  protracted \nnegotiations for land acquisition; decentralized responsibilities; and lack of understanding of \nADB policy requirements, including approaches to addressing gaps between ADB requirements \non Involuntary Resettlement and national law. \n \n9.  ADB is currently implementing a large infrastructure development program in Pakistan \nand the Government of Pakistan is reviewing the need for improved legislation on resettlement. \nIn the interim, to facilitate implementation of projects and provide greater understanding of \ninvoluntary resettlement, training will be provided to key agencies. ADB\u2019s Central and West Asia \nDepartment has requested that such training be particularly in the infrastructure sector. The TA \nwill focus on sectors where ADB loans result in large-scale land acquisition and resettlement. \nThe training program will be designed to suit the needs of executing agencies and stakeholders \nin the provinces.  \n \n                                                 \n5  The concept paper was cleared by ADB Management on 27 July 2006. The TA first appeared in ADB Business \nOpportunities on 19 November 2007. \n6  ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance for Capacity Building on Resettlement Risk Management (TA 6091-REG, \napproved on 19 December, for $500,000). \n ", "  3\n10.  With dedicated consultant support available, ADB will be better positioned to respond to \nits development partners and engage in regular interaction with stakeholders\u2014not only on \nproject-specific issues but also on policy dialogue and demand-driven capacity support.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The  overall  impact  of  the  regional  TA  is  improved  implementation,  and  better \nunderstanding by government and development partners, of ADB\u2019s policy requirements on \ninvoluntary  resettlement.  The  outcome  of  the  TA  is  enhanced  integration  of  involuntary \nresettlement requirements in ADB operations.     \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The  outputs  of  the  TA  will  comprise  (i)  resettlement  technical  support  to  resident \nmissions  and  headquarters  for  implementing  ADB\u2019s  policy  requirements  on  Involuntary \nResettlement, (ii) capacity development in Indonesia and Pakistan and (iii) technical support for \nenhancing legal frameworks in Viet Nam. The TA will be delivered through three components to \nbe implemented over 3 years: \n \n(i)  Component  1.  Local  consultants  will  be  placed  in  resident  missions  in \nBangladesh, Indonesia and Viet Nam for 3 years to provide support to ADB and \ngovernment  in  policy  implementation.  RSES,  in  consultation  with  regional \ndepartments and resident missions, will select the resettlement specialists and \nprovide training and supervision.   \n \n(ii)  Component  2.  Selective  capacity  development  support  will  be  provided  in \nIndonesia  and  Pakistan  based  on  consultations  with  regional  departments, \nresident  missions,  government,  and  counterpart  agencies.  The  training  will \nprimarily  consist  of  in-house  and  field-based  training.  Relevant  technical \nguidance notes will be prepared.  \n \n(iii)  Component 3. International specialists\u2019 expertise will be provided to support the \nenhancement of the land law in Viet Nam. Specifically, support will be provided in \ninternational best practice on land laws and asset valuation. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $800,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed \non a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The cost estimates cover consulting services, \ntraining and workshops, airfares, per diems, workshops, translation, domestic transport, and \nadministrative costs. The cost estimates are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA and RSES will be responsible for overall \nadministration.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  3  years,  tentatively  commencing  in \nFebruary 2008  with  an  expected  completion  date  of  February  2011.  Component  1  will  be \nimplemented in Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Viet Nam. The resettlement specialists will function \n ", "4    \nunder  the  guidance  of  the  country  director  and  RSES.  The  focal  agencies  for  capacity \ndevelopment will be BAPPENAS in Indonesia and the National Highway Authority in Pakistan.   \n \n15.  In Viet Nam, MONRE will be the focal agency for component 2. MONRE has already \nestablished a working group to conduct reviews and assessments of the existing land law and \nits implementation. It will play a key role in guiding the diagnostic and defining key support \nrequired by the consultant.  \n  \n16.  In Indonesia, implementation of component 2 will be coordinated with BAPPENAS, the \nresident mission and the regional departments. They will provide guidance on the focus of the \ntraining, and selection of participating agencies and candidates.  \n \n17.  In  Pakistan,  identification  of  participants  and  training  needs  will  be  prepared  in \nconsultation with the regional department, resident mission, and ADB partner agencies. The \ninfrastructure sector will be a key focus of the training.  \n \n18.  Consultant  input  for  the  following  activities  is  required  for  the  TA:  (i)  resettlement \ncapacity development, (ii) land law, (iii) land and property valuation, and (iv) training. Activities \nperformed under the TA are expected to require 162 person-months of consulting services, \ncomprising 18 person-months of international consulting and 144 person-months of national \nconsulting services. International consultant support will be provided intermittently over the TA \nimplementation period, including the home office and the field. Outline terms of reference for \nconsultants are in Appendix 3. Individual consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance \nwith its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The \ninternational specialists will work in close coordination with the national resettlement specialists, \nand maintain regular contact with the respective country directors. They will report directly to \nRSES. No procurement will be needed.  \n \n19.  The selection of resettlement specialists to be located in the resident missions will be \nundertaken by RSES, the respective regional departments, and resident missions. RSES and \nthe  relevant  representatives  of  each  regional  department  and  resident  mission  will  be \nresponsible for interviewing, ranking, and selection of the candidates. Initially, each specialist \nwill be recruited for 1 year with an option for extension of up to 3 years, based on the first year\u2019s \nperformance.  The  work  program  will  be  closely  coordinated  among  RSES,  the  regional \ndepartments, and resident missions. On project-specific work, the specialist will work closely \nwith the respective team leader and operational department resettlement specialist and the \nresident mission. On a day-to-day basis, the specialists will report to and work under the \nguidance of the country director, with technical support from RSES and the regional department \nresettlement specialist. The resident missions will provide logistical support to the specialist, \nincluding  office  space,  furniture,  and  administrative  support.  The  specialists  will  prepare \nsemiannual progress reports to RSES, the regional departments, and the country director. The \nspecialists will participate in semiannual workshops at ADB headquarters to share experience \nand disseminate knowledge.   \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n20.
