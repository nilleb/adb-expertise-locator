INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  This  regional  capacity  development  technical  assistance  (TA)  aims  to  establish  an \neffective commercial dispute resolution regime in  the Pacific developing member countries \n(DMCs) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) through international arbitration reform to boost \nregional  and  international  investor  confidence.  The  lack  of  a  modern  commercial  dispute \nresolution and enforcement regime potentially impedes foreign investment in the Pacific DMCs.1 \nArbitration has become an important and preferred method of resolving disputes within the \ninternational  business  community.2 The  Pacific  DMCs  can  benefit  from  a  well-functioning \ninternational  arbitration  regime  that  combines  well-written  national  laws  on  arbitration  and \nmembership in the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards \n(New York, 1958) (NY Convention), along with capacity building for implementing parties and \nusers of the reform. As such, establishing an effective dispute resolution system by promoting \ninternational commercial arbitration can create a better investment climate, facilitating more \ncross-border trade and investment to accelerate growth, reduce poverty and economic disparity, \nraise  productivity  and  employment,  and  strengthen  institutions  in  the  Pacific  DMCs. 3 \nConsultation missions to Tonga and Papua New Guinea (PNG) and discussions with Pacific \nDMC government officials, the private sector, and development partners have informed the \nissues and approaches of the TA. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.4 \n \n2.  The TA closely and synergistically aligns with ADB\u2019s highest priorities, including those in \nADB\u2019s  Strategy  20205 and  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020,6 which  reemphasized  the \nimportance of private sector development and regional cooperation and integration. It is part of \nADB\u2019s mandate to provide assistance to less-developed countries that will contribute to the \nregion\u2019s  economic  growth  and  promote  regional  cooperation.  The  TA  also  aligns  with  the \nregional  development  goals  on  strengthening  the  legal  framework  to  support  economic \ndevelopment  in  the  Pacific  DMCs.  In  addition,  the  TA  builds  upon  the  private  sector \nassessments of the Pacific Private Sector Development Initiative (PSDI), which recommend \nupdating the Pacific DMCs\u2019 legal frameworks to allow for international commercial arbitration \nand recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards.7 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Increasingly, foreign investors have been relying on international commercial arbitration \nfor dispute resolution because it is an effective, fair, timely, and often less-costly way to resolve \n                                                \n1  \u201cReforms to [alternative dispute resolution] regimes allow economies to offer a more attractive investment climate \nto foreign investors.\u201d S. Pouget. 2013. Arbitrating and Mediating Disputes: Benchmarking Arbitration and Mediation \nRegimes for Commercial Disputes Related to Foreign Direct Investment. Policy Research Working Paper. No. \n6632. Washington, DC: World Bank, p. 23. The lack of an effective dispute resolution regime also affects a \ncountry\u2019s World Bank\u2019s Doing Business rankings. \n2  \u201cStudies find that more than two-thirds of multinational corporations prefer commercial arbitration over traditional \nlitigation, either alone or in combination with other alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, to resolve cross-\nborder disputes.\u201d Footnote 1, p. 4. \n3  Economists  have  identified  and  emphasized  the  important  role  of  international  commercial  arbitration  in \ninternational market integration.

Other  advantages  include  the  finality  of  the  arbitral \nawards, the parties\u2019 right to select a neutral forum, the parties\u2019 right to select the adjudicators for \ntheir dispute to increase impartiality and subject matter expertise, the ability to choose flexible \narbitration  procedures,  confidentiality,  and  reduced  cost.9 Hence,  when  making  investment \ndecisions, international investors often consider whether a country is supportive of international \ncommercial arbitration, including, in particular, if the enforcement of foreign arbitral awards is \nlocally supported, i.e., whether the country has signed on to the NY Convention and has the \nlegal framework to give effect to it.10 \n \n4.  The NY Convention is widely recognized as a foundational instrument of international \ncommercial  arbitration  and  provides  a  globally  accepted  and  well-endorsed  method  of \nrecognizing foreign arbitral awards in other signatory states.11 It creates a uniform international \nframework, which enables parties to international commercial arbitration agreements to enforce \nforeign arbitration awards with relative ease as compared with foreign court judgments. Further, \nthe NY Convention narrowly limits appeals from an award, which makes international arbitration \nmore attractive to parties seeking finality in commercial disputes. Once a party has obtained an \naward from the tribunal, that award can be enforced in any of the ratifying countries. As of \nSeptember  2016,  156  of  the  193  United  Nations  member  states  had  adopted  the  NY \nConvention; however, the majority of Pacific DMCs have not agreed to it.12 Moreover, many \nPacific  DMCs  do  not  have  domestic  legal  frameworks  to  support  the  recognition  and \nenforcement of international arbitration awards. \n \n5.  Although PNG is one of the Pacific DMCs\u2019 larger economies, it is not a contracting party \nto the NY Convention, and its Arbitration Act of 1951 has not been updated to support the \nenforcement of foreign arbitral awards and reflect current international arbitration practices. Not \nbeing a party to the NY Convention contributes to PNG\u2019s difficulty in enforcing contracts and \nforeign  arbitral  awards.  Additionally,  PNG  is  the  only  Asia-Pacific  Economic  Cooperation \neconomy that has not ratified the NY Convention.13 While Tonga\u2019s reform priorities include \nprivate sector development and attracting more foreign direct investment,14 it does not have a \ndomestic  or  international  arbitration  regime.  The  Government  of  Timor-Leste  is  looking  to \nincrease foreign investment to diversify its economy, but investment opportunities are hampered \nby weak contract enforcement and the absence of an effective dispute resolution system. While \nFiji made progress by acceding to the NY Convention in September 2010, no amendments have \n                                                \n8  Foreign investors view arbitration as a way to mitigate risks by providing legal certainty on enforcement rights, due \nprocess, and access to justice.

Madison. \n11 Prior to 1958, international arbitral awards and arbitration agreements were rarely enforceable because there was \nno effective mechanism in place to ensure cross-border recognition and enforcement. \n12 Out of 14 Pacific DMCs, only Fiji, Cook Islands, and Marshall Islands have has acceded to the NY Convention. The \nfollowing Pacific DMCs have not acceded to the NY Convention: Kiribati, Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, \nPalau, PNG, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. \n13 PNG  will  be  hosting  the  Asia-Pacific  Economic  Cooperation  Leaders  Summit  in  2018,  which  will  provide \nopportunities  for  PNG  business.  http://www.businessadvantagepng.com/apec-summit-to-deliver-significant-\nopportunities-for-papua-new-guinea-businesses/ \n14 Government  of  Tonga,  Ministry  of  Tourism  and  Labour.

Similar  business  law  reforms  have  been  recommended  to \nattract more foreign investment in other Pacific DMCs such as Palau and Samoa. \n \n6.  In  addition  to  legal  reform,  the  capacity  for  international  arbitration  needs  to  be \nstrengthened through regional awareness-building and dissemination workshops, and tailored \ntraining programs for potential and practicing arbitrators, lawyers, and judges. The workshops \nwill increase the demand and capacity for international arbitration in selected Pacific DMCs. For \nexample, the private sector, as the primary user of the international arbitration reform, will need \nto be educated on how the reform works. Lawyers and potential and practicing arbitrators will \nneed to be trained in international commercial arbitration practices, and judges will need to be \ntrained  in  recognition  and  enforcement  proceedings.  Over  time,  the  usage  of  international \ncommercial  arbitration  for  dispute  resolution  can  be  increased,  along  with  a  new  regional \nnetwork and trained group of regional arbitration practitioners in Pacific DMCs, encouraging \nregional integration and development in international arbitration. \n \n7.  Recently, the governments of PNG15 and Fiji16 announced their intention to proceed with \nthe proposed international arbitration reform. Moreover, during a consultation mission in August \n2016, the Government of Tonga requested assistance under the TA to draft an arbitration act, \naccede to the NY Convention, and provide capacity building. The United Nations Commission \non  International  Trade  Law  (UNCITRAL),  as  the  Secretariat  to  the  NY  Convention,  also \ninformed ADB that it has been reviewing PNG\u2019s Arbitration Act for proposed accession to the \nNY Convention, and is in discussions with the Fiji government on updating its Arbitration Act of \n1965.17 \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The impact will be increased foreign investor confidence leading to greater economic \ndevelopment potential in the Pacific DMCs. The outcome will be an effective international \ncommercial dispute resolution and enforcement regime established in selected Pacific DMCs. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n9.  The TA impact and outcome will be achieved through the following outputs: \n \n(i)  Output 1: Deposit of a binding instrument of accession to the Convention \non the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (New York, \n1958). This output will assist the selected Pacific DMCs to deposit a binding \n                                                \n15 The Government of PNG, through the Department of Justice & Attorney General, announced its intention to move \nforward with accession to the NY Convention at the South Pacific Seminar on Access to Justice for Better Trade in \nPacific Small Islands Developing States held in Port Moresby on 19\u201322 September 2016, supported by the United \nNations Commission on International Trade Law\u2019s (UNCITRAL\u2019s) Regional Centre for Asia and the Pacific and the \nMinistry of Justice of the Republic of Korea. ADB was represented by its Office of the General Counsel at the \nseminar. \n16 In September 2016, the President of Fiji announced that the review of the Arbitration Act is on the agenda of the \n2016  Parliamentary  session.  http://www.fiji.gov.fj/Media-Center/Speeches/H-E-THE-PRESIDENT-SPEECH-AT-\nTHE-OPENING-OF-PARLIAM.aspx. \n17 Palau has also expressed some interest in acceding to the NY Convention, and may consider this proposed reform \nafter the general elections in November 2016. \n ", "4   \ninstrument  of  accession  with  the  NY  Convention\u2019s  Secretariat.18 This  output \nincludes  liaising  with  UNCITRAL,  as  the  Secretariat,  to  assess  the  relevant \nPacific  DMC\u2019s  readiness,  encompassing  reviewing  the  national  law  and  its \nupdates  or  new  law  for  compliance  with  the  basic  requirements  of  the  NY \nConvention,  and  assisting  in  the  drafting  of  any  policy  papers  or  directives \nrequired  for  government  approval  of  accession  (i.e.,  cabinet  approval  and \nParliament ratification). A team of consultants will advise on accession, from \nnegotiation to deposit of the accession instrument. \n(ii)  Output 2: Final drafts of new or updated arbitration laws to implement the \nConvention  on  the  Recognition  and  Enforcement  of  Foreign  Arbitral \nAwards  (New  York,  1958)  and  reflect  modern  international  commercial \narbitration standards. This output will support the drafting of new or updated \nlaws to reflect international commercial arbitration practices (including recognition \nof  international  arbitration  agreements)  and  implementation  of  the  NY \nConvention.19 Prior  to  drafting  any  laws,  a  diagnostic  assessment  will  be \nconducted, taking into account the local context, to develop a legal framework for \ninternational  commercial  arbitration  in  each  selected  Pacific  DMC. 20  It  is \nexpected that the final draft of the updated or new law will be submitted to the \nrelevant legislative body for approval. \n(iii)  Output 3: Strengthened capacity for international commercial arbitration \nreform. This output will strengthen capacity for international arbitration reform \nthrough  regional  awareness-building  and  dissemination  workshops  for \nstakeholders  and  tailored  training  programs  for  parties  involved  in  the \nimplementation of the reforms. Regional awareness-building and dissemination \nworkshops will be for private sector stakeholders as the main users of the reform, \ngovernment  officials,  arbitration  practitioners,  academia  representatives,  and \njudges. Lawyers and potential and practicing arbitrators will be trained in updated \nor new laws and international commercial arbitration best practices, and judges \nwill be trained in foreign arbitral award recognition and enforcement proceedings. \nThe  TA  will  conduct  a  needs  assessment  to  design  tailored  in-country  and \nregional  workshops  and  training  programs for stakeholders.  Additionally,  this \noutput  will  help  establish  a  regional  network  of  arbitrators  and  arbitration \npractitioners in the Pacific DMCs to share knowledge and best practices in the \nregion and internationally, and provide training to its members. \n \n10.  Depending on the circumstances, a selected Pacific DMC may request assistance under \none or more outputs. The risks are (i) a delay in reform enactment because of a lack of political \nsupport or change of government, and (ii) the governments\u2019 lack of capacity and resources to \nimplement international arbitration reforms (although this risk will be mitigated by output 3). \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-V).  Pacific  DMC  governments  may  provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office space with furniture, support services \n                                                \n18 The NY Convention enters into force 90 days after the relevant instrument of accession is deposited. \n19 TA assistance under output 2 may include legislative drafting workshops for selected Pacific DMCs. \n20 Output 2 will also consider whether the relevant national arbitration law should be modeled after the UNCITRAL \nModel Law on International Commercial Arbitration 1985, with amendments adopted in 2006. \n ", "  5 \nfor consultants, and other in-kind contributions. The cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  ADB, through the Office of the General Counsel (OGC), will be the executing agency.  \nOGC will be responsible for the overall TA administration and supervision and will engage the \nrequired  consultants.  OGC  will  work  with  the  relevant  ministries,  judiciary,  private  sector, \nchamber of commerce, and law society to implement the TA, and will coordinate with ADB\u2019s \nPacific Department, Pacific Subregional Office, Pacific Liaison and Coordination Office, PSDI, \nand relevant resident missions. All Pacific DMCs will be eligible for assistance under the TA \nupon request. However, TA resources will be  primarily focused on Pacific DMCs that are \ncommitted to international arbitration reform and have the capacity to implement the assistance. \nThe selection of the Pacific DMCs will also be aligned with ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy \n2020, the respective country partnership strategy, and the Pacific Regional Operations Business \nPlan. It is envisaged that the TA will provide assistance to the governments of Fiji, PNG, and \nTonga  based  on  initial  consultations  and  discussions  with  government  officials  and \nUNCITRAL.21 Other  Pacific  DMCs  may  be  supported  based  on  demand  and  subject  to \nincreased TA funding. \n \n13.  The TA will be implemented from November 2016 through December 2019. A team of \nconsultants will be engaged to carry out the implementation of outputs 1, 2, and 3. The TA will \nuse 18 person-months of consulting services (12 person-months of international inputs and 6 \nperson-months of national inputs).22  Two international consultants will be engaged for 6 person-\nmonths each, on an intermittent basis, to implement outputs 1, 2, and 3.23 For each selected \nPacific DMC, a national consultant will be engaged for 1 person-month to provide local law \nadvice,  as  required.  Further,  a  national  project  coordinator  will  be  engaged to  handle the \nlogistical and administrative arrangements for the workshops and training programs. Additionally, \nresource persons will be engaged to deliver the workshops and training programs, as needed. \nConsultants will be recruited as individual consultants under ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for \nconsultants is in Appendix 3. ADB will also collaborate with UNCITRAL Regional Centre for Asia \nand the Pacific to deliver workshops and training programs under output 3 on a case-by-case \nbasis, and to achieve outputs 1 and 2. The precise implementation arrangements will depend on \nthe selected Pacific DMCs and scope of the assistance request. TA disbursements will be done \nfollowing ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n14.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis for \nthe Promotion of International Arbitration Reform for Better Investment Climate in the South \nPacific, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n21 ADB will not finance or conduct any TA activities unless it has received a no objection in writing from each selected \nPacific DMC.  \n22 Lump-sum payments and/or output-based contracts will be considered under the TA when applicable in line with \nMidterm Review of Strategy 2020 action plan Nos. 2.9.2. and 2.10.2. \n23 International consultants may be recruited on an individual basis directly or through a firm. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the Project is Aligned with \nForeign investor confidence increased, leading to greater economic development potential in ADB\u2019s \nPacific developing member countries (DMCs) \n \n  Performance Indicators  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  with Targets and Baselines  Reporting  Risks \nOutcome       \n       \nAn effective  Use of international  ADB mission reviews  Enactment of the \ninternational  commercial arbitration by  and ADB country reports  relevant laws and/or \ncommercial dispute  foreign investors increased  and assessments  regulations is delayed \nresolution and  in the selected Pacific    due to lack of political \nenforcement regime  DMCs  World Bank\u2019s Doing  support and \nestablished in  Business surveys  commitment and/or \n(Baseline: 0; from October \nselected Pacific    change of government \n2016 data) \nDMCs  Pacific Private Sector  during reform process \n \nDevelopment Initiative   \nSelected Pacific DMCs\u2019 \nassessments  Governments lack \nrankings in the World \ncapacity and resources \nBank\u2019s Doing Business  Public news alerts, NY \nto implement \nsurvey improved  Convention and \ninternational arbitration \n  UNCITRAL websites, \nreforms \n(Baseline: from October  and law firm briefings \n2016 data) \n       \n   \nOutputs       \n \n1.
