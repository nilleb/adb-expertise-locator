INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) requested technical assistance \n(TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for the Reform and Diversification of the Local \nGovernment  Bond  Market.  Following  a  fact-finding  mission  in  June  2018,  ADB  and  the \ngovernment reached an understanding on the objectives, scope, implementation arrangements, \ncosts, and terms of reference for the TA. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \nThe TA is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2016\u201320181 for the PRC.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  A country\u2019s economic development\u2014and the capacity of the finance sector to support that \ndevelopment\u2014depends on a well-functioning local currency bond market. A local government \nbond market is an integral part of the local currency bond market and is needed to deepen the \nfinance sector. Development of a local government bond market that supports national financial \nstability is a key vehicle for mobilizing domestic financing for infrastructure, improving domestic \npolicy management, and supporting better public debt sustainability. 3 Access to a full range of \nfinancing  options  is  necessary  given  the  PRC\u2019s  rapid  urbanization,  its  desire  to  promote \nsubregional growth, and the need for local governments to upgrade infrastructure and better meet \nincreasing demands for public services. Access to a deep debt market will raise their efficiency in \nmobilizing resources. In the PRC, up until 2015, local governments were essentially forbidden \nfrom directly issuing bonds or borrowing from banks. In October 2014, the State Council of the \nPRC issued a rule laying out guidelines for the supervision of local government debt. 4 The Budget \nLaw of the People\u2019s Republic of China was amended and enacted on 1 January 2015 authorizing \nprovincial governments to issue local government bonds. \n \n3.  Fiscal  decentralization  and  increased  local  government  responsibility  over \nfinancing. The PRC continues to decentralize fiscal mechanisms while creating more sustainable \nurbanization, requiring local governments to enhance infrastructure while seeking better ways to \nsupport their funding needs and financing mechanisms. The lack of urban development financing \nunderlines the need to develop the local government bond market and diversify the investor base. \nThe PRC is the world\u2019s third largest bond market by volume of outstanding debt (following the \nUnited States and Japan) comprising $9.1 trillion or 67.7% of the gross domestic product as of \nMarch 2018.5 This local currency bond market is primarily composed of government bonds.6 To \novercome financing challenges and mitigate concerns about the use of nontransparent local \ngovernment financing vehicles (LGFVs), government emphasis has been placed on developing \na local government municipal bond market. The PRC\u2019s central government has emphasized the \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2016. Country Operations Business Plan: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2016\u20132018. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 16 July 2018. \n3  A. Mehrotra, et al. 2012. Developments of Domestic Government Bond Markets in Emerging Market Economies and \ntheir Implications. BIS Working Paper Series. No.67. Basel: Bank for International Settlements. \n4  Rule No. 43 provided for (i) strictly supervising the financing channels of local governments; (ii) shutting down \nnonstandard financing channels; (iii) allowing local government issuance of general purpose bonds to finance social \nwelfare projects; (iv) disallowing local governments from providing guarantees for firms, private institutions, or \npersons without legal authorization; and (v) enhancing the infrastructure for local government debt.  \n5  ADB. Asia Bonds Online. Size of Local Currency Bond Market in % of GDP. (accessed 18 June 2018). \n6  ADB. Asia Bonds Online. People\u2019s Republic of China. Six major types of instruments are traded: (i) government \nbonds;  (ii)  People\u2019s  Bank  of  China  paper;  (iii)  financial bonds issued  by government-backed  policy  banks; \n(iv) corporate bonds; (v) commercial paper, issued by either securities firms or private corporations; and (vi) medium-\nterm notes. \n ", "2 \nneed for local governments to take full responsibility for their finances and expanding the market \nfor local government bonds can help build that capacity.7  \n \n4.  Narrow investor base and a small and illiquid secondary market. The over-the-\ncounter interbank bond market and the exchange markets (Shanghai and Shenzhen  stock \nexchanges) represent the main avenues where bonds are traded, with the over-the-counter \ninterbank bond market comprising about 95% of total activity. Although the proportion of local \ngovernment  bonds  in  the  overall  PRC  bond  market  has  reached  about  one-quarter,  local \ngovernment bonds have limited liquidity and a low turnover rate of only 0.11 times. Local \ngovernment bond issuance in 2017 was CNY4.36 trillion and the total issuance outstanding is \nCNY14.74 trillion. While Bond Connect provides a solid mechanism for foreign investors to directly \ninvest in the local bond market, they invest significantly less in local government bonds because \nof a combination of policy restrictions, credit concerns, and overall lack of interest.8 Only 0.1% of \noutstanding local government bonds issued are held by foreigners, according to data provided by \nthe Treasury Department of the Ministry of Finance (MOF). The current investor base primarily \ncomprises commercial banks that hold the securities to maturity.  \n \n5.  The coupon rates on debt lack differentiation and are affected by factors that may \ncontribute to increasing the cost of borrowing for local governments. These factors include the \nlimited investor base and the lack of a secondary market. Another possible explanation is that \nbanks view their investment through their local bank branches as an opportunity to enhance their \nrelationship with the respective local governments. Hence coupon rates are set independent of \nthe ratings and actual credit quality of the issuing local governments.9 The options for managing \nfinances and balancing revenue and expense streams are limited. The credit rating system used \non local bond issuances is another concern impacting the development of the market. While the \nPRC has a formal credit rating industry, only domestic rating agencies have been authorized to \nrate local bonds and the May 2017 decision of the People\u2019s Bank of China to allow entry of foreign \ncredit rating agencies will take time to have an impact.10 To allow differentiation of rating results, \nlocal rating mechanisms must be linked to international practices that can be more easily \nunderstood or accepted by potential foreign investors. More rating and pricing differentiation is \nneeded to support market enhancement.  \n \n6.  Limited debt issuance and management capacity. While an explicit guarantee over \nlocal government debt no longer exists, investors often still hold a perception of an implicit \nguarantee. Local governments need to enhance capabilities and mechanisms to structure, issue, \nand manage bond financing. Various factors have swelled the volume of debt assumed by local \ngovernments\u2014often accumulated through nontransparent mechanisms such as LGFVs, raising \ninvestor  worries  over  defaults  and  the  fiscal  soundness  of  local  governments. While  local \ngovernments have extensively used LGFVs for financing since 2008, their use has recently been \ncurtailed.  Paradoxically,  while  material  risk  exists,  the  credit  ratings  of  LGFVs  and  local \n                                                \n7  \u201cCentral government control of the scale of local government bonds should be eliminated, while responsibility to issue \nand repay bonds should be held by the city or county that will actually use the funds, Xu Zhong, head of the People\u2019s \nBank of China\u2019s research bureau, wrote in an editorial on the financial news website Yicai.\u201d Reuters. 2017.

China opens local bond ratings to global agencies. 4 July. \n ", "3 \ngovernments are often high.11 Local governments have limited, directly controllable revenue \nsources to support bond repayments. Funding flows from central government transfers are \nuncertain. The rise in debt levels, the lack of functional bond management skills, and concerns \nover potential defaults impair (i) the development of the market, (ii) the capacity to draw in a larger \ninvestor base (including foreign investors), and (iii) the ability to issue different bond structures.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: quality of the environment for local government \nbond market issuance improved. The TA will have the following outcome: investor confidence in \nthe local government bond market increased.  \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n8.  The TA will assess the impediments to expanding the interest of investors (both domestic \nand foreign) to invest in local government bonds. The TA will also support knowledge transfer to \nlocal governments and finance bureaus on best practices in structuring and issuing bonds. The \nTA will be implemented through a combination of providing research and education, institutional \nand policy advice, and practical exposure to best practices that can be applied locally. ADB has \nhad  extensive  engagement  in  supporting  the  development  of  bond markets  and  provincial \ndevelopment strategies,12 as well as improving public finances.13 The TA will draw on the \ncombined experience in these areas to provide sound and holistic solutions.  \n \n9.  Output 1: Local government bond issuance framework improved. Output 1 will \n(i) assess current practices on bond structuring, issuance, and administrative procedures, as well \nas debt and capital investment management capacity by local governments; (ii) assess the current \npolicy, regulatory, infrastructure, and institutional framework governing the local government bond \nmarket to determine the appropriateness of the framework and identify impediments to market \ndevelopment; (iii) survey the local institutional investor base to assess their interest in local \ngovernment bonds and evaluate their requirements or impediments to investing; (iv) survey a \nsample of potential foreign investors to identify their impediments to investing in local government \nbonds; (v) hold consultations on multi-issuance channels to include the Shanghai Free Trade \nZone, the Shanghai Stock Exchange, the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, and the Bond Connect \nmechanism (footnote 8); (vi) assess best practices in selected developed countries to identify \nwhat elements can be applied in the PRC, focusing on bond structuring, distribution, investor \ntargeting, information disclosure, and transparency; (vii) conduct national training and workshops \nfor  local  governments  and  finance  bureaus  to  disseminate  the  best  investment  processes \nidentified; (viii) hold an international conference to bring in experts and discuss practices that can \nbe best applied in the PRC; and (ix) conduct a management study tour for the MOF, selected \nfinance bureaus, and local governments to identify first-hand the best practices that can be \napplied in the PRC. The study tour will be held in ADB member countries that have expanded \ntheir local government bond markets since around 1990. The TA aims to improve investor \n                                                \n11 \u201cThe rapid growth in Chinese local governments\u2019 indebtedness and their inability to shoulder this burden have \nbecome a persistent concern to regulators and investors in recent years.\u201d L.

This will lower the risk premium and cost of \nlocal government borrowing and allow the issuance of bonds with longer maturities to better match \ninvestment needs.  \n \n10.  Output 2: Local governments\u2019 capability to structure and issue bonds expanded. At \nleast three local governments will be selected as pilot locales to receive detailed assessments. \nThe assessments will focus on current and proposed bond structuring and issuance mechanisms, \nfinancial management capacity for bond debt, the viability of proposed bond issuance and links \nto funding needs, and knowledge of their credit capacity and issuer rating implications. The pilot \nlocales will have abbreviated shadow ratings prepared and ratings\u2019 sensitivity analysis completed \nthrough peer comparisons. This will raise awareness that deepening a local government bond \nmarket is linked to (i) the fiscal health and discipline of the issuers and (ii) perceptions of the \nmarket by potential investors. The pilot locales preliminarily selected include a lesser-developed \nprovince (Sichuan Province), one of moderate development (Jiangsu Province), and one with high \ndevelopment (Shenzhen Municipality) being the most well-positioned to be of interest to foreign \ninvestors. In addition to the pilot assessments, other local governments and finance bureaus will \nbe studied through surveys and outreach meetings. Output 2 will include training for local \ngovernments, finance bureaus, and the MOF to (i) introduce best practices in bond structuring \nand  issuance  mechanisms;  (ii)  learn  how  capital  markets  perceive  creditworthiness;  and \n(iii) discuss special purpose bonds, tenor extension of bond issuances, and the link between risk \nand pricing.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $440,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB's Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The key expenditure items \nare listed in Appendix 2. \n \n12.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff; domestic \ntransportation to perform surveys and attend training, workshops, and conferences; access to \ndata and document sources as needed; facilities for key meetings between the implementing \nagency and consultants; printing and distribution of project material; assistance in coordinating \nmeetings; and other in-kind contributions.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  The MOF will be the executing agency. The Treasury Department of the MOF will be the \nimplementing agency. The implementing agency will assign staff to a working group to support \nthe TA and organize workshops, conferences, and the study tour. ADB will select, supervise, and \nevaluate consultants; and provide staff to act as resource persons in workshops and conferences \nif needed. One national firm will be recruited using quality- and cost-based selection with a 90:10 \nquality\u2013cost ratio for the national consultant inputs.14 ADB will engage consultants and carry out \nprocurement following the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and its \nassociated  project  administration  instructions  and/or  staff  instructions.  The  implementation \narrangements are summarized in the table. \n \n                                                \n14 Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n ", "5 \nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation  October 2018\u2013October 2020 \nperiod \nExecuting agency  Ministry of Finance \nImplementing agency  Treasury Department of the Ministry of Finance \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \nIndividual: Individual  International expert in local  $100,000 \nselection   government bond markets (4 \nperson-months) \nFirm: Quality- and  National expert in local  $90,000 \ncost-based selection  government finance and bond \n(90:10)   markets (5 person-months) \nNational expert in sub-sovereign \ncredit ratings and bond markets \n(5 person-months) \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time).  \nADB = Asian Development Bank, TA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank \n \nIV.
