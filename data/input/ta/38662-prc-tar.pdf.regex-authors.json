During the 2005 Country Programming Mission, the Government of the People\u2019s Republic \nof China (PRC) requested the assistance of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to prepare two \nprojects: (i) the Henan Ecological Agriculture and Rural Productivity Improvement Project, and \n(ii) the Central and Southern Shanxi Integrated Agricultural Development Project. This project \npreparatory technical assistance (TA)1 will prepare the projects to meet (i) the PRC\u2019s goals of \nimproving sustainable rural economic growth and poverty reduction, and (ii) ADB\u2019s goal of poverty \nreduction. The TA Fact-finding Mission was fielded from 13 to 20 April 2006 in Henan province \nand from 21 to 25 April 2006 in Shanxi province. This report is based on (i) the findings of the \nMission; and (ii) the understandings reached with the Government on the objectives, scope, \nterms of reference, implementation arrangements, and cost estimates for the TA. \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The PRC\u2019s rapid economic growth over the past 15 years has increased incomes and \nreduced poverty. However, rural income growth has lagged behind urban income growth, leaving \nwidening income differentials between rural and urban areas and between eastern, central, and \nwestern regions of the country. In its Eleventh Five-Year Plan, the Government places a high \npriority on reducing rural-urban income differences through its New Socialist Countryside Policy.2 \nThe policy prioritizes investment in (i) improving rural growth, (ii) increasing farm productivity to \nraise rural incomes, and (iii) carrying out environmentally sustainable production.  \n \n3.  Henan province\u2019s Sanmenxia municipality has a rural population of 2.2 million (72% of the \nmunicipality\u2019s total population). This population depends on agriculture for a living. Sanmenxia is \nlocated in the transition zone from PRC\u2019s northern plains to the loess plateau region, and its \nsloped areas are complexly fragmented, with most production taking place on small plots on \nslopes, terraces, and riverside areas. These conditions contribute to the municipality\u2019s low rural \nincomes and 7% of the rural population lives on less than CNY7 per capita per day. The options \nfor high productivity arable production are limited, but the municipality\u2019s agro-climatic conditions \nare suited to fruit orchards and fast-growing tree species. In order to raise rural productivity and \nincomes  in  Sanmenxia,  cropping  patterns  need  to  change  so  farms  are  linked  to  reliable \nmarkets.3 \n \n4.  Shanxi  province  has  only  1.07  million  hectares  of  dependable  cultivated  land  for  its \n23 million farmers. Like Sanmenxia, southern and central Shanxi are located in the transition \nzone to the loess plateau and face similar productivity constraints. The area is bordered by the \nYellow River and a number of tributaries, and valleys and flood flats are important production \nareas. In the target 26 counties in the five prefectural-level municipalities of Changzhi, Jinzhong, \nLinfen, Luliang, and Yuncheng, the per capita land area is less than 0.17 hectares. The average \n2004 annual net income in the province\u2019s designated poor areas is about CNY1,615, CNY683 \nlower  than  the  provincial  average.  Across  the  province,  the  average  urban  net  income  is \nCNY7,005, compared with average rural incomes of CNY2,299, giving an urban-rural income \nratio of 3:1. There is a need to improve the use and management of flood flats, valley areas, and \nmarginal lands, and to rehabilitate degraded lands to raise land productivity and returns from farm \noutput. Better links to markets through local processing industries and the development of value \nchains will further raise farm incomes and create additional nonfarm employment. \n \n                                                 \n1   The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 20 July 2006. \n2  The Policy was officially disclosed on 21 February 2006 by the PRC\u2019s State Council and the Central Committee of \nthe Communist Party. \n3  The PRC is the world\u2019s leading producer of deciduous fruit and dominates world trade in apples and apple juice \nconcentrate. Last year, the PRC\u2019s apple production was 21 million tons, of which 1 million tons were exported.  The \nPRC has 60% of world trade in apple juice concentrate, half of which goes to the United States. The industry is \nexpanding (it grew by 20% in 2005) and there has been heavy investment in modern processing technology and a \ndramatic consolidation of orchard systems, both by agroprocessors leasing state farm land or organizing group \nsmall-farmer contracts. Western Henan and southern Shanxi are major production bases for the high-acidic type \napples favored for juice processing. \n ", "2   \n5.  In addition to the inherent low fertility of loess soils, other environmental problems are \ncaused by (i) the declining organic matter content of soils because of inappropriate cultivation \npractices that have left soils susceptible to rain and wind erosion, (ii) overuse of fertilizers and \npesticides, (iii) alkaline wastelands, and (iv) damage from windborne dust from coalmining (in \nShanxi province). In Henan\u2019s Sanmenxia municipality and across Shanxi province, shortages of \nwater (13% of the PRC average) arise from low average annual rainfall (400 mm\u2013650 mm) \nconcentrated in July\u2013September and high evaporation rates. To stabilize the soil and to increase \nfarm  output  in  Henan\u2019s  Sanmenxia  municipality,  environmentally  sustainable  strategies  are \nneeded to improve incomes by developing orchards and tree crops on eroded, flat, and sloping \nland. To improve use of riverside areas, marginal lands in valley areas, and alkaline wastelands \nin central and southern Shanxi province, investments are needed to develop and rehabilitate \nmedium- and low-yielding land and to conserve land and water resources. \n \n6.  A further constraint on farm income growth in both provinces is limited access by farmers \nto environmentally safe technologies that would increase productivity and produce outputs that \nmeet the standards and demands of markets. Farmers have limited access to technical advice or \nsupport services and some of the varieties demanded by processors and end markets are not \navailable. Farm production and agro-enterprises must (i) meet the grades and standards required \nby the domestic urban markets, especially those of the growing number of supermarket chains; \nand (ii) meet the phytosanitary requirements of international export markets. Farmers and agro-\nenterprises need information on standards for food safety requirements and safe agricultural \nchemical use, and regulations on agro-chemical use. To address the limited capacity of public \nextension services to provide market information and to transfer technology that is relevant to the \nrapidly changing market, provincial and local governments are investigating alternative ways of \nproviding services, including using agro-enterprises to provide information directly to farmers and \ndeveloping farmers\u2019 associations to organize farmers.  \n \n7.  Farmers have limited access to finance and especially term lending for investment in \nimproved technology and production expansion. The rural finance system is reluctant to lend to \nsmall farmers and rural agro-enterprises because of the perceived risks of lending to the rural \nsector, most farmers\u2019 lack of collateral, and the absence of systems providing information on \nborrowers. The formal rural financial system is not sufficiently developed to provide sustainable \noutreach to farmers and enterprises. Currently, most rural finance is channeled through local \ngovernment financial bureaus, although local governments believe there is potential to supply \nfinance to farmers through established agro-enterprises linked to supply contracts.  \n \n8.  A critical constraint to raising farm incomes is the shortage of value-adding opportunities \nbecause  of  lack  of  access  to  viable  agro-processing  and  marketing  enterprises,  and  high \ntransaction costs in the value chain. Growth of agro-enterprises is also constrained by limited \nagricultural raw material supply. Such over or under supply of raw materials reflects processing \nenterprise-farmer coordination failures in some cases. In other cases, limited processing capacity \nreflects the failure of financial markets to meet the investment needs of small- and medium-sized \nagro-enterprises. Thus, both farmers and agro-enterprises find it difficult to expand access to the \nPRC\u2019s growing urban and export markets. Nevertheless, there are viable private agro-enterprises \nin the project area that are successfully reaching domestic and export markets for fruit-based and \nother agro-products and are creating nonfarm employment and such success has the potential for \nbeing expanded and replicated. \n \n9.  Henan  province\u2019s  Sanmenxia  municipality  and  Shanxi  province  are  considering  two \nmodels to overcome information, coordination, and financial market constraints: (i) an \u201centerprise-\nfarmers  associations-production  base\u201d  approach,  and  (ii)  an  \u201centerprise-production  base\u201d \napproach.4  These  models  will  aim  to  improve  input  supply,  provide  financing  and  technical \n                                                 \n4  The \u201centerprise-farmers associations-production base\u201d model will be used where agro-enterprises will link backwards \nto large numbers of farmers through a formal intermediary such as a farm association. The \u201centerprise-production \nbase\u201d approach will be used where processing enterprises will link backwards directly to a manageable number of \nfarmers. ", "  3\ninformation,  and  guarantee  markets.  Equitable  and  monitorable  contracts  between  agro-\nenterprises and farmers, and technical support for farmers are needed to improve processing \nenterprise-farmer coordination. Application of the models will require investment in (i) changed \ncropping patterns, (ii) sustainable production methods, (iii) agro-processing capacity expansion, \nand (iv) a stronger information and regulatory service capacity. \n \n10.  Initiatives to raise farm incomes will benefit from (i) strong local government support for \nPRC\u2019s New Socialist Countryside Policy (which is reflected in new agriculture sector development \nplans for Henan and Shanxi provinces), (ii) the successful development of agro-enterprises, (iii) a \nsound concept of linking farmer households with markets through successful agro-enterprises, \nand  (iv)  the  potential  to  develop  corporate  social  responsibility  toward  farmers  and  the \nenvironment.  \n \n11.  The Government recognizes that thorough market analyses are a prerequisite for viable \nlending to private agro-enterprises and farmers. Lessons from ongoing ADB support to the West \nHenan  Agricultural  Development  Project5  show  the  importance  of  avoiding  a  predetermined \nsupply-driven approach to enterprise selection and planning. World Bank (WB) support to agro-\nenterprises in Shanxi has highlighted the need to understand changing market conditions and to \navoid selecting underperforming state-owned and small new agro-enterprises, which have a high \nrisk of failure.6 Selection criteria for agro- and farm-enterprises will include (i) the viability of \nmarkets, (ii) the economic feasibility of the enterprises, (iii) principles of equity and fairness in the \nselection process, and (iv) the extent to which private  agro-enterprises will actively support \nenvironmental sustainability and the objective of improving farmers\u2019 incomes. The Government \nsupports efforts to explore innovative ways of reaching poor and low-income farmers, including \ninvolving private sector enterprises to solve market and institutional constraints while promoting \ngood governance and social responsibility.7 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome8 \n12.  The  TA  will  appraise  the  Henan  and  Shanxi  governments\u2019  sector  analyses,  plans, \ncapacity and proposals, and solutions. This will form the basis for assisting the Government to \nprepare two projects for two separate loans. The impact of the TA is expected to be the \noutcome of these loan projects, i.e., improvements in rural on-farm productivity and market links \nin an ecologically sustainable and pro-poor manner. The projects will involve both public and \nprivate sectors and build on their relative strengths. The analytical and design work carried out \nunder the TA will center on (i) improving land and environmental management in low-yielding \nflat and hilly areas, exploitable riverside areas, and other degraded lands using improved crop \nand livestock production mixes and methods, soil improving technologies, and greater use of \ntree crops; (ii) improving incentives to farmers by facilitating the rural value chain and focusing \non high-value agricultural products demanded by local private agro-enterprises (thus linking \nfarmers to domestic and export markets); and (iii) identifying ways to reduce transaction costs in \nthe  value  chain  by  addressing  information,  coordination,  and  finance  constraints  faced  by \nfarmers and agro-enterprises.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  Henan province\u2019s Sanmenxia municipality and Shanxi province have prepared proposals \nto address rural poverty and rural environmental problems using the models described above \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2000.

Implementation \nCompletion Report on a Credit in the Amount of US$100 Million Equivalent to PRC for a Shanxi Poverty Alleviation \nProject. Washington, DC (IDA-28340).  \n7  Henan and Shanxi provinces have prior experience in implementing ADB and WB agriculture, environment, and \nnatural resource projects, and have been assessed as having sufficient capacity to support municipal and county \ngovernments, several of whom also have prior experience with ADB and WB loans.  \n8  Refer to the design and monitoring framework in Appendix 1. \n ", "4   \n(para. 9). The designs in each province follow a sustainable rural value chain improvement \napproach and improved service delivery by linking agro-enterprises with the production base \nthrough  better  organization  of  farmers  and  farm  households.  Proposed  activities  include \n(i) improving  land  and  water  use  in  hills  and  valleys  using  better  production  methods,  soil \nimproving  technologies,  water  conservation  methods,  greater  use  of  tree  crops,  and  more \nefficient use of animal wastes and organic fertilizers; (ii) facilitating access to markets by farmers \nand securing raw  material supplies by investing in the production base through local agro-\nenterprises; (iii) improving coordination between farmers and agro-enterprises by establishing \nand  strengthening  farmer  associations;  and  (iv)  extending  the  adoption  of  environmentally \nsustainable and safe food production by strengthening monitoring, regulation, and information \ndissemination.  \n \n14.  The TA will (i) appraise each province\u2019s proposals, (ii) assess the sector analysis and the \nassumptions upon which the proposals are based, (iii) complete sector and market analyses as \nneeded, (iv) compare alternative approaches to meeting project goals and desired outcomes, and \n(v) identify design improvements as needed. Specific analyses will include (i) validation of market \nanalysis for target enterprises; (ii) identification of technical improvements to soil and water \nmanagement  and  ways  to  mitigate  the  environmental  impact  from  agricultural  production; \n(iii) assessment of constraints and options for accessing rural finance by agro-enterprises and \nfarmers; (iv) assessment of existing and potential ways to improve agro-enterprise and farmer \ncoordination through farmers\u2019 associations and improved government extension services; (v) \nappraisal of sample sub-projects; and (vi)  analysis of the financial, economic, environmental, and \npoverty and social impacts of the proposed projects.9 The TA is divided into two components, \nresponding to the particular needs of the provinces concerned. Component A will address the \nproposal from Sanmenxia municipality in Henan province to improve ecological agriculture and \nraise productivity. Component B will address the proposal from Shanxi province for integrated \nagriculture development in valley areas.  \n \n15.  Each component will have two phases. Two major outputs are expected under phase 1: \n(i) a  sector  and  subsector  situation  analysis,  with  accompanying  technical,  economic,  and \ninstitutional assessments; and (ii) agreement on the project rationale, scope, and approach. The \nwork carried out under phase 1 will need to (i) confirm that the Government\u2019s proposals address \nthe binding constraints in the sector, (ii) assess proposed solutions and compare them with \nalternatives, (iii) demonstrate the economic rationale for the proposed investment as a public \nsector operation in terms of addressing failures or limitations of markets, and (iv) prepare the \nsubproject selection criteria. Phase 2 will be based on the successful delivery of the outputs \nunder phase 1 and will cover the activities leading to the design of the investment projects. The \nproposed investment projects will seek to maximize benefits to small-scale farmers and ensure \nlinks to markets through viable agro-enterprises. Assessments related to ADB requirements, for \nexample, on relevant safeguard policies triggered, will be addressed throughout the study. During \nphase  2,  (i)  the  institutional  capacity,  including  the  financial  management  capacity  of  the \nExecuting Agency (EA) and implementing agencies, will be evaluated; (ii) project costs will be \nprepared;  and  (iii)  the  economic  and  financial  feasibility  of  the  projects  will  be  assessed. \nThroughout both phases, ADB\u2019s project performance management system guidelines and ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  Project  Design  and  Monitoring  Framework  will  be  followed,  and  effective \nstakeholder consultation and participation will be carried out. Key activities for each output are \nincluded in the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,250,000. ADB was requested to finance \n$1,000,000, comprising $500,000 for preparing the Henan (Sanmenxia) project and $500,000 for \nthe Shanxi project. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA Special Funds \nresources. The governments of Henan (Sanmenxia municipality) and Shanxi will each provide in-\nkind contributions of $125,000 for office space, counterpart staff, site transportation, and other \n                                                 \n9 The initial poverty and social analysis is provided in Appendix 2. ", "  5\nservices. Details of the cost estimates for each component are provided in Appendix 3. The \nGovernment has been informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any \nensuing project.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The EA for component A will be the Sanmenxia municipal government. The \u201cproject \nleading group\u201d has been established and will be chaired by the vice mayor and will consist of the \nMunicipal  Development  and  Reform  Committee,  Municipal  Finance  Bureau,  Forest  Bureau, \nEnvironment  Protection  Bureau,  Agriculture  Bureau,  Hubin  district,  and  Ling  Bao  city. \nRepresentatives from these agencies will comprise the project management office. The agro-\nenterprises will manage day-to-day implementation activities with farmers. The EA for component \nB will be the Shanxi provincial government headed by another leading group and a provincial \nproject management office based in the Poverty Alleviation Office to provide overall supervision \nand monitoring. Changzhi, Jinzhong, Linfen, Luliang, and Yuncheng municipalities and the 26 \nproject  counties  have  established  a  project  management  structure.  The  municipalities  and \ncounties will be the implementing agencies.  \n \n18.  The  two  components  will  be  implemented  independently  through  separate  contracts.  \nUnder component A (Henan Sanmenxia), consulting services will consist of six international \nconsultants for 16.5 person-months and six national consultants for 18 person-months. Under \ncomponent  B  (Shanxi),  consulting  services  will  consist  of  six  international  consultants  for \n16 person-months  and  six  national  consultants  for  19  person-months.  The  outline  terms  of \nreference for consultants are in Appendix 4. The consultants will be selected and engaged by \nADB using the quality- and cost-based selection method in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants. Equipment (notebook computers, facsimile machines, and photocopiers) \nwill be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. For components A and B, the \nconsultants will submit (i) inception reports 4 weeks after their services start, (ii) interim progress \nreports at appropriate stages of TA implementation, (iii) draft final reports before the conclusion of \nthe contract, and (iv) final reports 2 weeks after incorporating the EAs\u2019 and ADB's comments.10 \nComponent A will commence in September 2006 and will be completed in June 2007, while \nComponent B will begin in October 2006 and be completed in August 2007. ADB will field \nsupervision and support missions for TA milestones including TA inception, the midterm review, \ndraft final report review and project loan fact-finding, and project appraisal.  \n  \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for preparing the Henan Ecological Agriculture \nand Rural Productivity Improvement Project and the Central and Southern Shanxi Integrated \nAgricultural Development Project, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n10  All reports will be submitted in the English and Chinese languages.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumption \n \nRural on-farm productivity  Rural household incomes  Municipal and provincial   \nand market links in the  in the project areas to  statistics on rural incomes  \u2022  Agro-enterprises\u2019 links to \nproject areas of Henan  increase from present    markets, including export \nand Shanxi provinces  average of xxa to xxa by  Land office reports on land  markets, remain strong \nimproved in an  the end of the project  use and measurements of   \necologically sustainable    runoff and soil quality  Risk \nand pro-poor way  Area covered by forest    \u2022  Farmers are not in a \nand orchards to increase  Project monitoring reports   position to negotiate fair \nfrom xxa to xxa by the end  prices and conditions in \nof the project  their contracts with the \nagro-enterprises \n \nOutcome      Assumption \n  \u2022  TA consulting team works in \nProject designs for two  Agreement reached  MOU signed by the  constant collaboration with \nloans, which respond to  between the Government  Government of the PRC, EAs,  the EAs. \nthe clients\u2019 needs and  and ADB on the final loan  and ADB    \nfulfill ADB requirements  project designs for Henan   Risk \nand safeguard policies  and Shanxi  \u2022  The Government rejects the \nTA consulting team\u2019s design \nproposal \n \nO( fourt peuactsh  component)   ( for each component)b              \u2022A ssuTmA pctoinosnusl ting team given \n1.

The agribusiness and agro-processing \nsubsectors are seen by the Government as a means for reducing rural poverty by linking between rural people and \nmarkets. By actively developing farmers\u2019 associations as the link between producers and agro-enterprises, the low-\nincome and poor farm households are expected to be empowered in their negotiations with agro-enterprises as \nsuppliers of inputs and purchasers of outputs.   \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nGiven the expected outcome of the resulting loans (improving rural on-farm productivity and market links in an \necologically sustainable and pro-poor manner), the technical assistance (TA) will also analyze links between poverty \nand natural resource management. In particular, the rural sociologist/farmers\u2019 organization specialist will identify the \nformal and informal arrangements that govern the use of land and water resources, including common resources. The \nspecialist will also map resource use in the project area in terms of purpose, intensity of use, access by different \nsegments of the farming community, and analyze the dynamics of poverty in terms of marginalization and access to \nresources. \n \nThe TA will be required to prepare a poverty and social assessment of the beneficiaries and stakeholders using the \nAsian Development Bank\u2019s Guidelines on Poverty and Social Assessment. \n \nC.
