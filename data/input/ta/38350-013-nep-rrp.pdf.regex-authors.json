I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto Nepal for the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) Road Connectivity \nProject.  The  report  also  describes  a  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Capacity \nStrengthening for Sustainable Road Transport, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, \nacting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA.1 \n \n2.  The proposed project will improve connectivity in Nepal and between Nepal and its \nneighbors. The main investment is an alternate route in Sunsari and Saptari districts. This will \ncreate year-round passable conditions along the East\u2013West Highway (EWH), especially across \nthe Koshi River. The repair of three feeder roads in the hill areas will improve connectivity \nbetween villages along this road system and better access to basic services. The project comes \nwith gender equality and social inclusion (GESI) plan, and the government staff will be trained \non road maintenance, planning and project management.  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.   Nepal is a landlocked country.  More than 70% of the area is mountainous terrain. Road \ntransport is central to economic and social development, accounting for almost 90% of the \ncountry\u2019s passenger and freight movement. Poor road connectivity is a major constraint for \nNepal. Its road density is low\u201414 km per 100 km2 or 0.9 km per 1,000 people. The so-called \nstrategic road network (SRN), with a total length of about 14,490 km of national and feeder \nroads, is the core of Nepal\u2019s roads system. It carries most of the country\u2019s road traffic and \nprovides linkages to major economic centers and neighboring countries. This network consists \nof three main east\u2013west corridors and several north\u2013south corridors. The east\u2013west corridors \nincludes the EWH (1,024 km). This is the main artery in the country and the one with the \nheaviest traffic into the Terai region. The East\u2013West corridors also comprise (i) postal roads \nrunning in parallel with the EWH along the Indian border to the south; and (ii) the Mid-Hill East\u2013\nWest Corridor (MHC), a series of feeder roads (1,700 km) that link mid-hill districts and the main \ncenters in the hills, including Kathmandu and Pokhara. \n4.   Approximately 32% of the SRN is paved, while 23% is gravel, and 45% is earth. As the \nbackbone  of  Nepal\u2019s  national  highway  system,  the  EWH  must  meet  minimum  technical \nstandards and be passable all year round. While the EWH is in a reasonable condition, parts of \nthe highway, in particular the main Koshi Barrage in Sunsari District, are prone to damage from \nheavy floods and require alternate routes in case of closure. Nepal actively participates in the \nSASEC program. EWH is critical for domestic connectivity, but also key to link it to India.  \n5.   Only 6% of the MHC is paved. The government wants to improve the entire 1,700 km \nstretch  into  all-weather  maintainable  standard.  This  will  connect  communities  and  provide \naccess to basic services. There is also a need to improve north\u2013south linkages between EWH \nand MHC.  \n6.  Nepal\u2019s transport strategy is set out in the Three Year Plan (2010\u20132013). This is based \non a Sector Wide Road Program and Priority Investment Plan (2007\u20132017).2  Key priorities \n                                                 \n1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2 The World Bank. 2007. Sector Wide Road Program and Priority Investment Plan. Kathmandu. ", "2 \n \ninclude (i) connecting the regional centers and all 75 district headquarters, (ii) completing the \nMHC, and (iii) strengthening the road maintenance. The Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and \nTransport (MPIT) is responsible for road network planning and road sector policies. Under MPIT, \nthree agencies have responsibilities related to road network management. The Department of \nRoads (DOR) is responsible for network planning, design, construction, and maintenance of the \nSRN. The Department of Transport Management (DOTM) is responsible for vehicle registration \nand renewal, vehicle inspection, overloading control, route permits, and driving licenses. The \nRoads Board Nepal (RBN) is mandated to create a road fund through the collection of road user \ncharges. The RBN approves the DOR's annual road maintenance plan and monitors the use of \nfunds allocated to it. \n7.  Maintenance work is funded from fuel levies and registration fees. For 2012, $30 million \nwere allocated for regular, periodic and recurrent maintenance. This level of funding will need to \nincrease in line with the expansion of the road network. While a road asset management system \nis in place, and tolling and performance-based maintenance contracts are in use, improvement \nof both schemes is necessary. An integrated road maintenance scheme needs to be developed. \nThere is also a need to improve the collaboration and coordination work by DOR, DOTM and \nRBN.  \n8.  The alternate EWH route, connecting to the new bridge over the Koshi River at Chatara,3 \nwill ensure that the EWH is passable year round. The upgraded feeder roads in the mid-hill \nregion will facilitate regionally balanced economic growth. The feeder road in the Indian border \narea  is  one  of  the  key  sections  of  the  SASEC  corridor  (Kakarvitta\u2013Panitanki\u2013Phulbari\u2013\nBanglabandha), which connects to NH31 in India and NH5 in Bangladesh. Work in these \nsections will complement work under a SASEC Trade Facilitation Program.4 The project is \nincluded in the country operations business plan, 2012\u20132014,5 and the South Asia Regional \nCooperation Operations Business Plan, 2013\u20132015.6 \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n9.   The  project  will  improve  local  and  regional  connectivity.  The  outcome  will  be  an \nimproved road transport system in eastern Nepal.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n10.  The  outputs  will  be  (i)  roads  upgraded  to  all-weather  standard  with  community \nparticipation  and  (ii)  improved  capacity  of  MPIT  (DOR,  DOTM  and  RBN)  in  road  asset \nmanagement and road maintenance, and enhanced capacity of DOR to deliver gender equality \nand social inclusion following completion of GESI guidelines for the road subsector. These \noutputs will be achieved through the Project and the TA.  \n11.  The project will upgrade about 73 km of bypass road and border road along EWH to two-\nlane standard and about 114 km of MHC7 to intermediate-lane standard. The road construction \n                                                 \n3 The bridge is being constructed under ADB. 2009.

To enhance biodiversity in the project area, the project \nwill provide training for the local people to become eco-guardians and to earn income by \nproviding accommodation for the tourists. To ensure social inclusiveness of the local people, \nawareness campaigns on road safety, sexually transmitted infection (STI) and human trafficking \nwill be conducted. The project will help DOR complete the GESI guidelines for road subsector, \nwhich will strengthen its capacity to improve gender equality and social inclusion in its future \noperation.  \n12.  The TA attached to the Project will strengthen capacity of the DOR, DOTM and RBN in \nroad asset management and road maintenance (para 18). \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n13.

Five  additional  unit  site  offices  will  be \nestablished, each of which will be led by a project manager. The DOR will recruit a construction \nsupervision consultant. Advance contracting has been undertaken. Other readiness filters are in \nplace. The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe PAM (footnote 9). \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements\nImplementation period  July 2013\u2013December 2018 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2018 \nManagement \n(i)   Executing agency  MPIT  \n(ii)   Implementing agency  DOR  \n(iii)  Implementation unit  DOR ADB Directorate in Kathmandu and 5 DOR project site offices (30 staff) \nProcurement  International  2 civil works contracts  About $39.8 million \ncompetitive bidding  1 equipment contract  About $2.7 million \nNational competitive  5 civil works contracts  About $13.2 million \nbidding  1 equipment contract   About $0.5 million \nConsulting services  QCBS (CSC)  54 international and 435 national  $4.5 million \n90:10  person-months  \nIndividual (safeguards  3 international person-months, 72  $0.5 million \n& GESI)  national person-months and 240 \nNGO person-months  \nRetroactive financing and/or  Advance contracting for procurement of works and recruitment of consultants \nadvance contracting \nDisbursement  The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2012, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements agreed \nupon between the government and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, CSC = construction supervision consultant, DOR = Department of Roads, GESI = \ngender  equality  and  social  inclusion,  MPIT  =  Ministry  of  Physical  Infrastructure  and  Transport,  NGO  = \nnongovernment organization, QCBS = quality-and cost-based selection. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n17.  E-submission of bids will be allowed for national competitive bidding work packages. The \nDOR has previously carried out e-procurement up to the stage of e-submission of bids for \nprojects funded domestically and by development partners. This work was efficient and effective \nin enhancing transparency and fair competition. \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n18.  A TA will be provided for strengthening sustainable road maintenance. The objective is \nto improve the capacity of three agencies: the DOR, DOTM, and RBN. The TA has three major \noutputs: (i) an integrated road maintenance scheme, (ii) a road user charge scheme, and (iii) \n ", "5 \n \nupgraded software for a highway management information system. The TA costs $570,000, of \nwhich $500,000 will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund \n(TASF-other sources). The government will provide the balance. An international consulting firm \nwill be recruited in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants to help with this \nwork. \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical  \n19.  Based on the feasibility study conducted under the project preparatory TA in 2010, \ndetailed design of the five project roads has been prepared.9 The design of road embankment \nand  drainage  structures  has  taken  into  consideration  the  likely  effects  of  climate  change. \nBioengineering techniques have been adopted as a slope protection measure for the mid-hill \nroads.10 These have been successfully applied in several road projects in Nepal, and the DOR\u2019s \nexpertise in this area is recognized. A road safety audit was performed as part of the detailed \ndesign  and  the  recommendations  were  incorporated  in  the  final  product.  With  bidding \ndocuments  ready,  advance  actions  have  been  taken  to  ensure  that  the  construction  can \ncommence early.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n20.  Economic viability. The benefits of the project will be savings in vehicle operating costs \nand travel time.11 The estimated economic internal rates of return (EIRR) range from 21.7% to \n30.6% for individual project roads. The overall estimated EIRR is 26.4%. The sensitivity analysis \nfurther confirms the robustness of economic viability. When the construction costs increase by \n10% or the traffic volume decreases by 10%, the EIRR is still above 12%. \n \n21.  In addition, the project will bring significant benefits to overall regional development. \nEven with the closure of Koshi Bridge during heavy flooding and/or landslides, transport along \nthe EWH would not be disrupted. Local communities will benefit from construction employment. \nAfter  project  completion,  they  will  have  access  to  markets  which  will  result  in  increased \nhousehold income. The benefits accrued from savings in vehicle operating costs will be passed \non to the poor through lower freight rates, lower passenger fares, and time savings. Households \nin remote areas will benefit from an increase in the availability of goods and a decrease in prices.  \n \n22.   Financial  sustainability.  Recurrent  costs  on  project  roads  will  decrease  after  the \nconstruction is completed. In the long term, incremental recurrent costs are estimated at 7% of \nthe current DOR maintenance budget, and less than 1% of the overall annual DOR budget. \nMaintenance will be required after 2018. By then, the government is committed to doing this. \n \nC.  Governance \n23.  Institutional. The DOR has a good track record of implementing ADB-financed projects. \nIt has sufficient capacity. This capacity is further increased by a World Bank project and an \n                                                 \n9 ADB. 2010.

Financial  management. A financial management assessment was carried out. The \nDOR has developed capacity in financial accounting and ADB disbursement procedures. The \nDOR  project  directorate  will  have  a  qualified  chief  project  accountant  and  two  assistant \naccountants. The DOR will also establish and maintain separate project records and accounts \nto identify the financing resources received and expenditures made under the project, ensuring \nan adequate audit trail. The government's Office of the Auditor General will annually audit the \nproject  accounts  and  related  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  international  auditing \nstandards.  To  further  minimize  risks,  ADB's  direct  payment  procedure  will  be  used  for \nsubstantial disbursements for works, goods, and consulting services. \n \n25.   Procurement  and  anticorruption.  The  government  has  promulgated  the  Public \nProcurement  Act  (2007)  and  Public  Procurement  Regulations  (2007),  both  of  which  are \ngenerally acceptable to ADB and encompass best international procurement practices. The \nPublic Procurement Monitoring Office has been assigned as the national procurement oversight \nbody under the Office of the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers. The government will \npublish  information  on  the  project  on  DOR\u2019s  website,  including  business  opportunities \nassociated with the project, and information on procurement of goods, works, and consulting \nservices. E-submission of bids which has substantially increased transparency and fairness in \nbidding competition of in the previous ADB road project will be adopted.14 \n \n26.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to and discussed with the government. The \nspecific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n27.  Poverty reduction and social impact. The Nepal Living Standard Survey conducted by \nthe Central Bureau of Statistics during 1995\u20132011 revealed a substantial decrease in poverty \nover recent years. However, the overall poverty situation in Nepal still remains serious. More \nthan 25% of the population lives below the government poverty line of NRs19,261 (about $246) \nper year. Rural poverty is almost twice as high as urban poverty. Poverty incidence is 34%\u201357% \nin  project-affected  rural  districts,  compared  with  25%  nationally.  In  the  project  districts  of \nRamechhap, Khotang, Sunsari, Udayapur, Bhojpur, Saptari, and Jhapa, a large proportion of \nthe population is indigenous. Most of these districts are also food insecure. Difficulties with \ntransport limit people\u2019s ability to take their agricultural products to markets. The results of \nhousehold surveys and focus group discussions conducted as part of the poverty and social \nassessment indicate that the project will increase economic and employment opportunities, as \nwell as, access to markets, production centers, and public and social services.  \n \n28.  Gender. A gender analysis highlights the type of benefits accruing from road projects. \nFocus group discussions with women in the project areas indicate that improved access to \n                                                 \n12 The World Bank\u2019s support focuses on management information systems, road safety, safeguard implementation, \nquality control, and human resources management. \n13 ADB. 2006.

Most local women, who currently travel by foot on \nearthen tracks that are impassable during the rainy season, will have safer, faster, and more \ncomfortable access once the investments are completed. Cash-strapped subsistence farmers, \nincluding  women,  will  benefit  from  other  activities  such  as  short-term  employment  in  road \nconstruction and maintenance. \n \n29.  A GESI plan incorporates the following gender mainstreaming features:  \n(i)  At least 50% of those trained and engaged in bioengineering for slope protection \nworks  will  be  women  from  local  communities. 15  This  will  be  facilitated  by \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs).  \n(ii)  At least 50% of those engaged in compensatory afforestation will be women. This \nwill be conducted in a partnership between community forest users and NGOs \n(footnote 15). \n(iii)  At  least  40%  of  those  trained  and  engaged  as  eco-guardians  will  be  women \n(footnote 15).  \n(iv)  At least 40% of those participating in road safety awareness sessions carried out \nfor affected communities in local languages will be women.  \n(v)  At  least  50%  of  those  participating  in  sexually  transmitted  infection  (STI)  and \nhuman trafficking awareness campaigns will be women. \n \n30.  The bidding documents have clauses to ensure that all civil work contractors comply with \nlabor laws by not employing child labor; encouraging employment of the poor (particularly \nwomen); and paying the same wage to men and women for work of equal value. Special \nprovisions for vulnerable households\u2014including those headed by women\u2014are provided in the \ncombined indigenous people and resettlement plans. A full time national GESI consultant will be \nplaced  in  DOR.  An  international  GESI  consultant  will  assist  DOR  finalize  guidelines  for \nmainstreaming GESI in the road sector. An NGO will carry out livelihood enhancement and \nawareness programs on road safety, STIs, and human trafficking.  \n  \n31.  HIV and human trafficking. The National Center for AIDS and Sexually Transmitted \nDisease  Control  under  the  Ministry  of  Health  and  Population  coordinates  activities  by \nstakeholders  committed  under  the  National  AIDS  Strategy,  2006\u20132011.16 This  emphasizes \nprevention as the most effective response. Anti-human trafficking activities are coordinated by \nthe Ministry of Women, Children, and Social Welfare. A large amount of information and print \nmaterial on human trafficking has been developed with the support of the United States Agency \nfor International Development, which now be reproduced for use in project areas. The project \nincorporates measures to mitigate HIV risks by having NGOs undertake awareness programs in \nthe corridors of influence. The contractors will carry out STI and human trafficking awareness for \ntheir laborers at work sites, which will be monitored by the construction supervision consultant \n(CSC). \n \nE.  Safeguards \n32.   Social  and  environmental  impacts  have  been  assessed  (and  will  be  mitigated)  in \naccordance with ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and government regulations and \npolicies.

The DOR has sufficient capacity in implementing environment and \nsocial safeguard plans. This has been demonstrated in the previous ADB projects. \n \n 33.   Environment. The alternate route for EWH falls under category A. It traverses an \nelephant corridor and also passes through the buffer zone of the Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve, \nwhich is a Ramsar site.17 The potential adverse impacts identified are disturbance of elephant \nmovement mainly due to increased traffic from the improved road and worsening of the existing \nhuman\u2013wildlife  conflicts  and  wildlife  disturbance  in  the  project  area.  The  environmental \nmanagement plan (EMP), which is a key part of the contractor\u2019s bidding documents, includes \nmeasures to address adverse impacts during all stages of project. Another component of the \nEMP is focused on a combination of biodiversity enhancement and gender-inclusive activities. \nThis  will  be  implemented  by  a  local  NGO  in  collaboration  with  existing  conservation  and \nlivelihood projects in the project area. Consultations have been carried out at various stages of \nproject  development  and  advice  was  sought  from  local  communities,  the  wildlife  reserve\u2019s \nmanagement, government agencies, and local and international NGOs. The EIA report was \nprepared and disclosed on the ADB website on 23 November 2012.   \n \n34.  The four feeder roads to be upgraded, (Leguwaghat\u2013Bhojpur, Halesi\u2013Diktel, Mechipul\u2013\nBirtamod, and Manthali\u2013Ramechhap) are classified under category B. They do not fall inside or \nnear protected areas or critical habitats. Most impacts from these roads are likely to occur \nduring  construction,  and  are  associated  with  earth  movement,  ground  shaping,  heavy \nequipment operation, and possible landslide and erosion. Appropriate mitigation measures are \nincluded in the respective EMPs, which will also feature in contract bidding documents. Public \nconsultations have been conducted with local communities and government agencies during \npreparation of the IEE reports. The reports have been disclosed on the ADB website as required \nby the Safeguard Policy Statement.  \n \n35.  The DOR project directorate will have an environmental focal person to coordinate and \noversee  proper  implementation  of  all  environment  safeguards.  Technical  support  will  be \nprovided  by  the  Geo-Environment  and  Social  Unit  (GESU),  which  is  responsible  for \nimplementing and monitoring social and environment safeguards for all DOR projects. The \nGESU has received capacity building assistance from various international agencies, including \nADB. Its team is capable and experienced. The CSC team includes an environmental expert \nthat will supervise and guide the implementation of the EMPs by the contractor. Biodiversity \nenhancement activities for the EWH road components will be implemented by a local NGO (in \nclose collaboration with the local Forestry Department, and the Department of National Parks \nand Wildlife Conservation). A training and coordination workshop will be conducted before \nproject implementation to clarify the roles and responsibilities of all project stakeholders. Semi-\nannual environmental monitoring reports for all the project roads will be prepared for disclosure \non the ADB website in compliance with the Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \n36.  The upgrading of the alternate EWH route is a climate change adaptation measure. The \nexisting EWH becomes inaccessible due to breaching of the Koshi Barrage by excess water \nand silt being brought down to the Terai from the mountains. With climate change and an \nincrease in glacial melting at the headwaters of the Koshi River, this problem is expected to \nbecome worse. Improvement of the existing EWH would be very expensive. The alternate road \n                                                 \n17 The Ramsar Convention (The Convention on Wetlands of International Importance, especially as Waterfowl \nHabitat) is an international treaty for the conservation and sustainable utilization of wetlands. \n ", "9 \n \nis located north of the existing EWH and the Koshi Barrage. The terrain in the project area is \nhilly and the deep gorge and steep slope allows the excess water to flow southward, hence the \nlikelihood of floods and damage to the road and Chatara Bridge is less. The alternate route is \nless  vulnerable  to climate  change.  The  engineering  design  of  the project  roads  has  been \nprepared  taking  into  account  climate  change  considerations  (temperature  and  rainfall). \nMeasures taken include raising road embankments and bridge heights, strengthening road \nsurfaces, improving drainage structures, and bioengineering on unstable slopes and erosion-\nprone areas. \n \n37.  Involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. The project design minimizes land \nacquisition and involuntary resettlement while adopting the most feasible technical features. A \nfull census of the areas was conducted. Combined indigenous peoples and resettlement plans \nhave been prepared for three of the project roads and resettlement due diligence reports have \nbeen prepared for two others in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, the Land \nAcquisition Act 1977, and other national laws and regulations. \n \n38.  The project will result in significant land acquisition and resettlement. A total of 76.49 \nhectares of private land will be acquired. Major impacts will be on 1,982 households, 1,383 of \nwhich will be physically displaced. Thus, 11,181 people will be affected. The total resettlement \nbudget for the project is $11.8 million. Compensation rates for the loss of land and structures, \nrelocation assistance, income restoration assistance, and additional support for vulnerable and \nindigenous groups are provided in the entitlement matrix. The combined plans outline the \ncompensation entitlements. These have been endorsed by the MPIT and an adequate budget \nhas been allocated. Consultation and information disclosure were undertaken with (i) people to \nbe displaced, (ii) indigenous peoples\u2019 households in the project areas and their leaders, and (iii) \nthe public through the ADB website. If any changes, additional land requirements, or involuntary \nresettlement impacts are identified, a new or updated resettlement plan will be prepared or \nmodified according to the laws referred to in the resettlement plan. ADB\u2019s approval will be \nobtained before further implementation of the relevant section of the project roads can take \nplace. The DOR project directorate will have a resettlement and safeguards focal person to \ncoordinate and oversee proper implementation of the combined plans. Technical support will be \nprovided  by  GESU.  The  CSC  team  will  include  a  resettlement  expert  that  will  guide  and \nsupervise implementation of the combined plans. The DOR will submit the monitoring reports to \nADB on a semiannual basis. \n \n39.  The government has declared 59 groups as indigenous peoples, or \u201cJanjatis\u201d as they are \ncommonly known, comprising about 37.2% of Nepal\u2019s population. Indigenous peoples make up \nabout 39% of the project district populations and 28% of the total household populations in the \nroad influence areas. Consultations with indigenous groups and their leaders were conducted \nas  part  of  the  social  impact  assessment,  and  the  census  survey.  This  was  done  in  an \natmosphere  free  of  coercion  and  in  a  culturally  sensitive  manner.  This  was  to  ensure  a \ncomprehensive perspective on the project and its impacts, to ascertain community responses \nand their needs and demands from the project, to estimate the losses they would suffer, and to \ntake steps to mitigate those losses. This process is to make sure that indigenous peoples will \nnot be affected more than the rest of the population and will have culturally appropriate benefits \nfrom the socioeconomic opportunities created by the project. The project will not have adverse \nimpacts on the identity, culture, and customary livelihoods of the indigenous people. \n \n ", "10 \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n40.
