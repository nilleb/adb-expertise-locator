An  environmental  impact  assessment  was \nAssessment  undertaken, and the summary circulated to the Board and made \npublic through the Asian Development Bank (ADB) website on \n31 May 2006.  \n   \nProject Description  The Project is located in southern Gansu province, one of the \npoorest  areas  in  the  PRC.  With  a  per  capita  gross  domestic \nproduct 45% of the national average, Gansu ranks 30th among \nthe 31 administrative areas. The Project is designed to promote \nsustainable economic growth by constructing an important section \nof the high-priority Lanzhou\u2013Haikou corridor and improving the \nlocal  road  transport  system.  The  Project  will  (i) provide  an \nintegrated  road  transport  network  in  southern  Gansu  by \nconstructing  the  134  kilometer  (km)  Wudu\u2013Guanzigou \nexpressway and upgrading its associated 357 km rural roads, \n(ii) improve road transport services by constructing 200 township \nbus stations and pilot-testing the road transport action plan, and \n(iii)  improve  corporate  governance  and  strengthen  institutional \ncapacity through providing consulting services and training. \n   \nRationale  Remote and isolated with harsh natural conditions, the project \narea suffers from inadequate road infrastructure, which is a major \ncause of the high incidence of poverty. Within this area, the focal \nprefecture of the Project (Longnan) has rural poverty incidence of \n42%, and 84% of the population lives in rural areas. About 57% of \nthe 169 townships do not have all-weather roads, while 24% of \nthe 3,237 villages have no road access and 25% lack bus service. \nNational Highway 212 is in poor condition, and provides the only \nsubstantial link to Sichuan province, and there are no rail lines or \nother non-road transport modes. Residents have limited mobility \nbeyond their localities. It takes 10\u201316 hours to reach Lanzhou, \nXi\u2019an, Chengdu, and Chongqing because of poor and worsening \nroad conditions. Despite the region\u2019s economic potential, weak \nroad  infrastructure  impedes  socioeconomic  development.  The \nroad transport network in southern Gansu needs to be improved \nto ease access to essential services and to link this poor, isolated \nregion to economic growth centers.  \n \n \n ", "iv \nThe Project reflects the ADB road sector operational strategy for \nthe PRC, which includes removing infrastructure constraints and \nsupporting policy and institutional reforms. The Project supports \nthe Government\u2019s Western Region Development Strategy, which \naims  to  improve  the  investment  environment  and  living \nconditions. The project expressway will reduce the trip length by \n50% (from 270 km to 134 km) and cut journey time by 75% (from \n6.5\u20139.0 hours to 1.5\u20132.0 hours). In addition, project interventions \nin rural road upgrading, township bus station construction, road \ntransport action plan pilot-testing and training of local transport \nauthorities will improve the availability, affordability, and efficiency \nof the road transport system; increase accessibility; and reduce \npoverty and isolation. \n \nImpact and Outcome  The Project will help promote sustainable economic growth and \nreduce poverty in southern Gansu. It will develop an efficient, \nsafe, and reliable road transport system. It will also improve rural \npeople\u2019s  access  to  markets,  income-earning  opportunities, \neducation and health services, and social activities. \n \nThe Project will (i) construct a 134-km toll expressway from Wudu \nto Guanzigou, (ii) upgrade 357 km of rural roads, (iii) construct \n200 township bus stations, (iv) pilot-test a road transport action \nplan,  (v) improve  corporate  governance,  and  (vi)  strengthen \ninstitutional capacity by providing consulting services and training. \n   \nProject Investment Plan  The investment cost of the Project is estimated at $1,660 million \nequivalent. Of the $300 million ADB loan, $20 million will finance \nrural roads and township bus stations.  \nFinancing Plan   ($ million)\n \nSource  Amount  % \n  Asian Development Bank  300.0  18.0 \n  Bank of Communications  712.6  43.0 \n  Ministry of Communications  332.0  20.0 \n  Gansu Provincial Government  315.4  19.0 \n  Total  1,660.0  100.0 \n  Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n   \n  A loan of $300 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will be \nprovided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility. The loan will have a 25-year term, including \na  grace  period  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.75% per annum, and such other terms \nand conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. \n \nAllocation and Relending  The ADB loan proceeds will be made available by the Borrower to \nTerms  the Gansu provincial government (GPG), which will onlend the \nloan  proceeds  to  Gansu  Changda  Highway  Company  Limited \n ", "  v\n(GCHC) with the same financial terms and conditions as those of \nthe ADB loan with GCHC bearing the interest rate variation and \nforeign exchange risks. \n \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2012 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2011 \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  Gansu  Changda  Highway  Company  Limited  will  be  the \nArrangements  implementing agency responsible for the project expressway. The \nGansu Provincial Communications Department will implement the \nrural road and transport service components. \n   \nExecuting Agency  Gansu Provincial Communications Department (GPCD)  \n   \nProcurement  Goods and services financed by the ADB loan will be procured in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. Civil works for the \nexpressway  will  be  procured  through  international  competitive \nbidding, and the civil works for the rural roads and township bus \nstations  through  national  competitive  bidding  and  shopping. \nEquipment  will  be  procured  through  international  competitive \nbidding.  Advance  procurement  action  for  civil  works,  and \nretroactive financing for eligible expenditures related to civil works, \nestimated at $30 million, were approved on 24 May 2006.  \n   \nConsulting Services  The  ADB  loan  will  finance  56  person-months  of  international \nconsulting services for construction supervision; provide expertise \nin  structure  engineering,  traffic  safety  engineering,  and  road \nmaintenance;  and  formulate  a  capacity  development  program. \nThe  international  consultants  will  be  recruited  through  a  firm, \nbased  on  full  technical  proposals  using  the  quality-  and  cost-\nbased selection method in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on \nthe  Use  of  Consultants.  GPCD  will  engage  and  finance \n7,600 person-months  of  national  consulting  services,  including \n350  for  rural  roads  and  transport  services,  to  ensure  proper \ndesign, supervision, and project management, as well as to train \ncounty  communications  bureau  staff;  320  for  environmental \nprotection;  and  30  for  monitoring  socioeconomic  and  poverty \nimpacts. The national consultants will be recruited in accordance \nwith government procedures acceptable to ADB. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The expressway will take 5\u20137 hours off travel time and shorten \nBeneficiaries  136  km  traveling  distance  between  Wudu  and  Guanzigou. \nImproved rural roads will link villages to the higher levels of the \nroad network and hence to the regional and national economy. \nImproved rural transport services will link rural households with \nthe wider economy through passenger and other motor vehicles \noperating  on  those  roads.  A  developed  transport  network  will \nintegrate  poor,  isolated  regions  with  the  centers  of  economic \ngrowth. The economic internal rate of return for the Project is \n ", "vi \n17.9%.  The  financial  internal  rate  of  return  is  4.6%,  which  is \nhigher than the real weighted average cost of capital. The Project \nwill benefit about 4.6 million people, of whom almost 37% are \npoor. \n \nThe  Project  will  directly  benefit  road  users  (e.g.,  passengers, \ntraders, transport providers, and bus and truck operators), as well \nas labor, local economy and the private sector. The Project will \nhelp reduce traffic accidents, vehicle emissions, and traffic noise \nin  the  corridor.  The  Project  will  also  boost  tourism.  Rural \nhouseholds are also important beneficiaries, and will benefit from \nincreased  incomes  through  better  access  to  markets,  off-farm \nopportunities, and also from better access to social services. It will \ncreate  about  56,000  person-years  of  unskilled  jobs  during \nconstruction and 1,700 full-time jobs during operation. Over 60% \nof the unskilled jobs will be filled by the poor, with an estimated \ntotal  of  CNY200 million  in  wage  payments  annually  during \nconstruction,  and  another  CNY15  million  of  wage  payments \nexpected to go to the poor annually after start of project operation. \nThe  ability  and  skills  of  local  communities  will  be  greatly \nenhanced  as  a  result  of  several  years  of  employment  in  the \nproject-related activities. The improved local transport system will \nenhance the local investment climate to attract more investment \nto the region and act as a catalyst for future investment.  \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The Project has been formulated to reduce technical, economic, \nfinancial, safety, and social risks. The main technical risks are \nassociated with the construction of 61 tunnels, including one that \nis 8 km in length. Consultants have reviewed the proposed design \nand construction methods, and prequalification of contractors will \nfocus  on  their  financial  and  technical  capabilities  in  handling \nsimilar  complex  works.  During  construction,  monitoring  and \ncontract  management  information  systems  will  be  set  up  to \nquickly  identify  technical  problems  and  correct  them.  The \ncontractors will be required to strictly enforce working safety rules \nand  measures.  GPCD  has  experience  and  has  performed \nsatisfactorily in internationally financed projects. \n \nThe financial risk associated with construction and operation of \nthe expressway will depend on levels of traffic, the capital cost, \nand toll rates. To mitigate the financial risks, the GCHC will build \nup  a  commercial  business  environment  for  expressway \noperations, the Project will receive substantial injections of equity \nfrom central and provincial governments, and a market-oriented \ntoll  structure  will  be  adopted.  The  Project  has  no  major \nenvironmental, resettlement, or HIV/AIDS infection risks, and has \nmitigation  and  monitoring  mechanisms  in  place.  GPCD \ndemonstrated  a  high  level  of  ownership  in  preparing  the \nresettlement plan, environmental impact assessment, and social \naction development plan. \n ", "Map 1\n96 o 00'E 106 o 00'E\nSOUTHERN GANSU\nROADS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT\nIN THE\nPEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA\nXINJIANG MONGOLIA\nUYGUR\nAUTONOMOUS\nREGION\nto Uru N\nmqi\nINNER    MONGOLIA\n0 50 100 150 200\nKilometers\nAnxi\n40 o 00'N Dunhuang Yumen JiJaiyuuqguuaann JGinataotai Linze to Hohhot 40 o 00'N\nYinchuan\nZhangye Minqin\nJinchang\nMinle\nNINGXIA\nWuwei\nGulang\nJingtai\nGANSU Tongxin Huan Xian\nJingyuan\nBaiyin\nQINGHAI to XininLginxiaLintaoLDAINNZGHXOIDUingxi PingLliuaonhganXdifoenngg uotoaB ot to Taiyuan to Zhengzhou\nTIANSHUI\nXi'an\nLintan Tianshui\nMinxian Baoji\nLixian\nLONGNAN SHAANXI\nChengxian\nLiangshui\nZoige Wudu\nWenxian\nJiouzhaigou\nAba\nGuanzigou Guangyuan\nM Wanyuan\nPPCAPrrDritoooyBjvp/eT-ioncFostci weniAadanrl n ePCcaraeopdjei tRcatol Radoad Dege SICHWUenAchNuan injianMgD R.eiaynaynagnCgHJEiaNnyNGaaDnngUJcialhingojianngS Rg.uining BDaazhzhoung DazhoChaungjiang R.WanxiaHnUBEI\nEA  CxDpoBrn-eFsstisrnuwacantiycoend Expressway under Ya'an NeijiaTuonjiangg R.

THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Southern Gansu Roads Development Project. \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n2.  The PRC has made remarkable progress in economic growth and poverty reduction. \nGross domestic product (GDP) has grown more than 9% per annum since the late 1970s, and \nthe poverty incidence declined from 33.0% in 1990 to 13.4% in 2003.1 Yet, the fight against \npoverty is far from over. The living standards of hundreds of millions of people, particularly in the \nwestern region, need to be raised. The inadequate road network, road transport bottlenecks, \nand the resulting high transport costs and poor transport services are a major constraint on \nefficient, sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction. \n \n3.  The change in the economy\u2019s structure and increasing diversification has resulted in a \nshift toward road transport.2 In 2005, the PRC had 31.8 million vehicle fleet (trucks, cars, and \nbuses), and 11.5 million other motorized vehicles (mainly motor-tricycle and agricultural trucks). \nThe privately owned fleet increased from 0.3 million vehicles in 1985 to 23.7 million in 2005, or \n24% per year on average. Given the low number of vehicles (2.4) per 100 people, large \ninvestments in automotive manufacturing, and reduced tariffs following the PRC\u2019s accession to \nthe Word Trade Organization, the vehicle fleet will likely continue to grow rapidly. Economic \ngrowth and the rising share of road transport will continue to place heavy demands on the road \nnetwork and intensify the need for capacity expansion in the coming years. \n \n4.  Despite the massive investment in road infrastructure,3 the road transport sector still \nconstitutes a serious obstacle to sustainable economic growth, particularly in the western region. \nThe total PRC road network reached 1.93 million kilometers (km) in 2005, of which 1.59 million \nkm were classified.4 Expressways and class-I highways accounted for 4% of the total length, \nand class-II highways for about 13%, while 83% (highways in class-III and below) are medium- \nto low-grade paved roads and gravel roads. With only 20 km of roads per 100 km2, and 1.47 km \nper 1,000 inhabitants, road network density is still among lowest in the world. The road network \nis mainly concentrated in east PRC, where road density is 50 km per 100 km2. Providing basic \nroad  access  in  vast  regions,  particularly  in  the  interior  provinces  where  incomes  are  low, \nremains a challenge. Details of the road sector analysis are in Appendix 2. \n \n5.  The rural road network is underdeveloped in extent and quality; 38,426 villages, mostly \nin the western region, have no road access at all. Nearly 10,000 townships and 300,000 villages \n                                                 \n1  The number of poor living below the international standard of $1 per day (in purchasing power parity terms), fell \nfrom 377.3 million in 1990 to 173.2 million in 2003. Over the last 20 years, the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) \nalone has accounted for over 75% of poverty reduction in the developing world (ADB. 2006. Key Indicators. \nAvailable: www.adb.org/statistics). \n2  From 1990 to 2005, road traffic\u2019s share of passenger traffic grew by 8.8% per annum, reaching 929.2 billion \npassenger-kilometer (km), and of freight, by 6.4% per annum, reaching 869.3 billion ton-km. In 2005, road traffic \naccounted for 53.2% of the country\u2019s total passenger traffic and 11.0% of the total freight traffic. \n3  The total investment during the Tenth Five-Year Plan (FYP) reached CNY1,900 billion, more than double that in \nthe previous 5 years.  \n4  About 1.58 million km of rural roads in poor condition were not considered in the official statistics because they did \nnot meet certain Ministry of Communications (MOC) technological standards. ", "2   \nhave no paved road access. Of the 1.56 million km of total rural roads, 80% are in class-IV and \nunclassified, and 60% have some level of gravel surfacing or are unpaved. Most rural roads lack \nbridges and drainage systems and are often closed during the rainy and winter seasons. As a \nresult, many rural poor in the west reside in either partial or full isolation. \n \n6.  Over 90% of the poor in PRC live in rural areas. Improving rural roads has substantially \nreduced  poverty.  The  Government  has  accelerated  rural  road  construction  to  close  the \ndevelopment gap between urban and rural areas.5 During the Tenth Five-Year Plan (10th FYP, \n2001\u20132005), investment in rural roads totaled CNY418 billion, three times that in the previous \n5 years. By 2010, all villages will have road access, and all townships will have paved roads. \nPaved roads will link all eastern villages, 88% of central villages, and 50% of western villages. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n1.  Problems and Constraints \n \n7.  Despite  rapid  economic  growth,  development  in  different  provinces  has  been \nimbalanced. In 2005, the GDP per capita of the western provinces was less than half that of the \ncoastal provinces.6 The road network still does not provide adequate access to the poorer inland \nregion;  vast  distances  and  difficult  mountainous  terrain  isolate  it  from  local,  regional,  and \nnational  markets.  Most  exports  and  imports  reach  major  markets  through  other  provinces, \nmeaning that inter-provincial transport development is an important determinant of growth and \ndevelopment. \n \n8.  Gansu is on the upper reaches of the Yellow River in northwestern PRC.7 Remote and \nisolated with harsh natural conditions, it is one of the least developed provinces. With a per \ncapita  GDP  of  CNY6,135  (45%  of  the  national  average),  Gansu  ranked  30th  among  the \n31 administrative areas. Annual per capita rural income was CNY1,980, or 61% of the national \naverage of CNY3,255. Of the population of 26.0 million, 7.6 million are poor, defined as living \nbelow the Government low-income line of CNY852 per capita per year (which is below the \ninternational poverty line of $1 per person per day). Rural poverty incidence in Gansu is 40%. \n \n9.  Inadequate infrastructure is the main reason for Gansu\u2019s high poverty. Gansu\u2019s road \ndensity is 9.1 km per 100 km2, significantly lower than the national average (20.0 km per \n100 m2).  The  focal  prefecture  of  the  Project  (Longnan)  is  isolated,  suffers  from  poor \ninfrastructure, and has only road transport. No expressway, class-I road, airport, or railway links \nLongnan to the outside world.  It takes 10\u201316 hours to reach Lanzhou, Xi\u2019an, Chengdu, and \nChongqing. National Highway (NH) 212\u2014a combination of class-II (8 km), class-III (180 km), \nand class-IV roads (82 km)\u2014provides the only substantial link to Sichuan. Constructed in 1958, \nit is narrow with steep slopes, sharp turns, and low speed with certain sections impassible \nduring the rainy and winter seasons. Traffic congestion is growing and will exceed the road\u2019s \ncapacity on several stretches by 2012. Residents have limited mobility beyond their localities \nbecause of higher transport costs. Poor access to transport constraints economic and social \ndevelopment and contributes to poverty. \n                                                 \n5  In 2005, the annual per capita net income of rural households was CNY3,255 ($402), while the annual per capita \ndisposable income of urban households was CNY10,493 ($1,306), three times more than that of rural households. \n6  The average per capita gross domestic product (GDP) in 12 western administrative areas was about 47% the east \nPRC. \n7  Gansu is landlocked, surrounded by Shaanxi in the east, Qinghai and Xinjiang in the west, Sichuan in the south, \nand Inner Mongolia and Mongolia in the north (Map 1). \n ", "  3 \n10.  Poor roads have led to inadequate and costly transport services in the project area. In \nLongnan, 820 villages have no direct access to bus services as bus operators are unwilling to \nuse bad roads because of high costs and danger. Transport demand is usually met by various \ninformal transport services such as motorized tricycles and dual-purpose pickups. Formal bus \nservices are of better quality, but suffer from low rates of vehicle utilization, resulting in relatively \nhigh unit costs. To sell their products, the rural poor often rely on traders who purchase farmers\u2019 \ngoods directly in the villages but at prices well below those in urban markets. The technical \nassistance survey indicated that 75% of local farmers sell their livestock at farm-gate prices.8 \n \n2.  Government and Asian Development Bank Strategies \n \n11.  The Government development strategy has shifted to the western region and rural areas \nto promote balanced growth.9 In the road sector, it will do the following: (i) Construct the national \nexpressway network totaling 85,000 km to expand the national trunk highway system (NTHS) to \nlink all cities with over 200,000 people. Much of this new construction directly supports the \nWestern Region Development Strategy (a key theme of the 10th and 11th FYPs). (ii) Improve \nrural roads, with emphasis on rural road maintenance and rural transport service to ensure \nsustainability and efficiency. (iii) Promote regional cooperation. The Ministry of Communications \n(MOC) is investing in the road sector to (i) close network gaps in the western region, (ii) divert \ncentral budget (e.g., vehicle purchase tax) to the rural transport system, and (iii) formulate a \nrural road development framework to attract all sources of funding for rural road improvement. \n \n12.  ADB\u2019s operational strategy in the PRC\u2019s road sector gives high priority to removing \ninfrastructure  constraints  and  supporting  policy  and  institutional  reforms.  ADB  supports \n(i) building roads that connect major growth centers, and improving access in the western and \ncentral regions; (ii) integrating the network so that the NTHS is supported by a system of local \nroads, particularly those that provide access to poor areas; (iii) promoting road safety and \nreducing  vehicle  emissions;  (iv)  strengthening  the  corporatization  and  commercialization  of \nexpressway organizations; (v) adopting appropriate pricing policies to ensure optimum use of \nroad transport capacity; and (vi) using alternative methods of investment financing, including \nprivate sector participation. ADB road sector assistance targets the poor western provinces. The \nProject is consistent with the PRC\u2019s development priorities and ADB\u2019s strategy. \n \n3.  Opportunities \n \n13.  The  expressway  from  Liangshui  town  in  Wudu  (capital  of  Longnan  [Map 2])  to \nGuangzigou (border with Sichuan) is an important section of the Lanzhou\u2013Haikou national high-\npriority western corridor (2,570 km). The project expressway will eventually connect Gansu to \nthe southern seaports of Beihai and Fangcheng in Guangxi, and Haikou in Hainan province, by \ntraversing  the  poor  interior  provinces  of  Gansu,  Sichuan,  Guizhou,  and  Guangxi,  and \nChongqing  municipality.  The  Project  will  promote  inter-provincial  trade  integration  and \ncooperation, provide better business opportunities, and stimulate economic growth within the \nproject area, and between rural and large urban areas, thereby reducing regional disparities. \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Preparing the Western Roads Development \nProject. Manila. \n9  Sustained, rapid growth is a priority in the Government\u2019s 11th FYP (which, unlike the 10th FYP, is a \u201cprogram\u201d rather \nthan a \u201cplan\u201d as it avoids specific targets). Also important is creating a more harmonious society, reducing income \ninequalities, strengthening human resources, protecting the environment, and cushioning the social impacts of \ndevelopment.  \n ", "4   \n14.  Several studies and much evidence confirm that transport development reduces poverty \nand affirm the relevance of ADB\u2019s strategy.10 The Project will upgrade rural roads and build \ntownship bus stations to connect poor rural areas to main artery roads. The integrated approach \nwill largely remove the barriers to accessibility and foster growth. \n \n15.  The  project  area  is  predominantly  agricultural.  Food  crops  include  wheat,  maize, \npotatoes, and buckwheat. The area has more rain than the rest of Gansu, and the mild and \nslightly humid weather is good for certain cash crops, including Sichuan pepper, olive oil, fruits, \nwalnuts, and medicinal herbs. Longnan possesses minerals (such as lead and zinc) and forests, \nand has the potential for ecological tourism. The main strategy for poverty reduction is economic \ndiversification  into  cash  crops,  tourism,  and  establishment  of  industries,  including \nagroprocessing and mineral production. Improved road transport will increase the production \nand export of mineral products, reduce the transport cost for cash crops, and promote tourism. \n \n16.  External assistance to the road sector has come mainly from ADB, the Japan Bank for \nInternational  Cooperation,  and  the  World  Bank.  Since  1991,  ADB  has  extended  33  loans \ntotaling $6.6 billion to finance 4,455 km of expressways and 8,964 km of associated local road \nnetworks. Of the ADB-funded projects, 18 have already been completed and are open to traffic. \nADB has also supplied 60 technical assistance (TA) projects totaling $32 million to the road \nsector.  The  advisory  TA  projects  have  addressed  policy  and  institutional  issues,  including \nhighway  planning,  road  safety,  human  resource  development,  socioeconomic  assessment, \ntransport pricing, and mobilization of nongovernment financial resources. The World Bank and \nJBIC have provided about $7.1 billion and \u00a5219 billion, respectively, to finance road investments. \nADB coordinates with both these organizations to ensure that each major development partner \nfocuses on different corridors, and information related to policy advice is shared across the \ndevelopment community (Appendix 3). \n \n4.  Lessons Learned \n \n17.  The assessment of ADB\u2019s operation portfolio in the PRC road sector highlighted a high \nlevel of performance, both in efficacy and effectiveness.11 Project completion reports prepared \nfor  18  road  projects  concluded  that  17  were  highly  or  generally  successful  and  1  partly \nsuccessful  (Appendix  3).  The  Gansu  Provincial  Communications  Department  (GPCD)  has \nimplemented three externally financed road projects well and without major problems.12 While \nthe overall performance of highway projects is by and large satisfactory, a number of the most \nrecent  issues  have  been  identified  for  consideration  in  the  project  design,  including \n(i) insufficient geological investigation, leading to problems with tunnel construction; (ii) deficient \nresettlement planning and implementation;13 and (iii) insufficient reporting on project benefit \nmonitoring and evaluation. \n                                                 \n10  ADB. 2000.

To reduce the engineering risks, complementary geological and soil investigations are \nbeing undertaken during the design stage. A tunnel specialist was engaged during project \npreparation and confirmed that the design of tunnels generally conforms to MOC standards. \nSpecific measures will be undertaken to mitigate the risks (para. 65). The Project will train \ndomestic tunnel experts. As for resettlement, (i) ADB explained its safeguard requirements to \nthe  agencies  early  in  project  preparation,  (ii)  GPCD  established  the  project  resettlement \norganizations during the feasibility study stage to carry out comprehensive field surveys to \nprepare the resettlement plan, (iii) consultations with affected villagers started at the beginning \nof project preparation to reflect their concerns, and (iv) an external monitoring agency will \nmonitor resettlement. To make benefit monitoring more effective and efficient, dialogues were \nheld with a few key representative communities in the project area, baseline indicators were \nestablished, and monitoring indicators and measures were agreed with GPCD (para. 48). \n \n5.  Policy Dialogue \n \n19.  Policy Reform in Road Transport. Efficient transport services are as important as \nimproving infrastructure to ensure that project benefits are passed on to road users at reduced \ncost. Gansu was selected as a case study in the recently completed ADB TA on policy reform in \nroad transport.14 The TA reviewed issues in road freight and passenger transport and prepared a \nroad transport action plan, recommending policy and regulatory measures to improve efficiency, \nsuch as easing bus fare control and bus route selection. As part of the Project, GPCD agreed to \npilot-test  some  of  the  recommendations  in  Longnan.  Experience  from  the  pilot  test  will  be \nreplicated in other areas to enhance the impact of the physical infrastructure improvement under \nthe Project (Appendix 4). \n \n20.  Promoting  Corporate  Governance.  Gansu  Changda  Highway  Company  Limited \n(GCHC) was established on 16 February 2001 to construct and operate the first World Bank-\nfinanced  highway.  The  registered  capital  of  GCHC  was  CNY500  million.  It  has  been  an \nimplementing agency for three internationally financed road projects, including the ongoing \nproject financed by ADB. It will also be the implementing agency for the project expressway. \nGCHC has the corporate governance structure required by the Company Law and follows \ncorporate governance practices acceptable to international financial institutes. To help achieve \nsound  corporate  governance  standards,  GPCD  and  GCHC  will  enter  into  a  concession \nframework agreement by 30 September 2007 before project construction starts (Supplementary \nAppendix  A). 15  The  agreement  will  ensure  autonomy  of  operations,  encourage  the \nestablishment  of  performance  indicators,  and  facilitate  contracting  out  of  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M). GCHC will prepare a corporate development plan by 31 December 2008 \nto  assure  a  high  standard  of  corporate  governance,  management,  financial  reporting,  and \nhuman resource development. The Project will train GCHC staff members to promote and \nstrengthen corporate governance. \n \n21.  Facilitating Private Sector Participation. The private sector has been involved in the \nroad sector through cooperative joint ventures, securitization through initial public offerings, \nrevenue bond financing,16 and build-operate-transfer projects. In Gansu, its participation in road \ndevelopment,  financing,  and  management  remains  embryonic,  mainly  because  low  traffic \nvolumes  and  potential  toll  revenues  are  not  financially  attractive.  However,  GPCD  is \nencouraging private sector participation in the road sector, and some potential private investors \n                                                 \n14  ADB. 2004.

Promoting Road Safety. Road safety is a serious issue in the PRC; the fatality rate was \n45 per 10,000 vehicles in 2004. The Road Traffic Safety Law took effect in May 2004. An inter-\nministerial  committee  coordinated  by  MOC,  involving  15  ministries,  was  established  in \nMay 2004 to develop and implement special measures to enforce regulations on overloaded \ntrucks. The fatality rate gradually improved to 31 per 10,000 vehicles in 2005, which is still very \nhigh  by  international  standards.  The  Project  will  (i)  establish  an  inter-agency  road  safety \ncommittee in Gansu to facilitate project implementation; (ii) ensure, in collaboration with Gansu \nPublic Security Bureau, a team of bureau personnel will patrol the project roads; (iii) adopt \nspecific safety facilities, such as emergency stop lanes, reinforced pavement in tunnels, and \nreinforced  traffic  signaling;  (iv)  conduct  independent  road  safety  audits  during  design, \nconstruction  and  before  start  of  operation;  (v) install  axle-weighing  stations  at  expressway \nentrances; (vi) establish a traffic surveillance center to monitor operations; and (vii) raise public \nawareness and disseminate road safety knowledge by linking the GPCD website with the ADB \nroad  safety  website.  As  part  of  the  Project,  a  risk  management  plan  will  be  prepared \n(Appendix 5). \n \n23.  Controlling Vehicle Emissions. With vehicles rapidly increasing, the Government has \ntaken measures to control vehicle emissions, including regulating the automobile industry, and \nrequiring an annual vehicle test, inspection, and maintenance program. The new measures set \nemission and fuel-efficiency targets, and offer tax incentives to manufacturers for production of \nmore environmentally friendly cars. GPCD will (i) encourage gas stations along the expressway \nto provide clean fuels such as compressed natural gas, liquefied natural gas and reformulated \ngasoline  in  addition  to  normal  gasolines,  (ii)  engage  a  qualified  environmental  monitoring \ninstitute to monitor ambient air quality along the expressway, and (iii) conduct a capacity-\nbuilding  and  training  program.  Because  of  faster  and  shorter  travel,  when  the  project \nexpressway opens in 2012, hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxide emissions from \nvehicles are estimated to be at least 20% lower than without the Project (Appendix 5). \n \n  6.  Rationale \n \n24.  Constraints and Opportunities. Rural poverty incidence in Longnan is 42%. Roads are \nthe only transport mode in Longnan. Roads and transport services are underdeveloped, which \nis a major cause of poverty. This transport bottleneck needs to be removed to facilitate moving \ngoods and people between rural and urban areas and between Gansu and Sichuan and beyond. \nThe Project, a priority investment in the 11th FYP, will integrate the region with the centers of \neconomic growth (Lanzhou, Xi\u2019an, Chongqing, and Chengdu).18 \n \n25.  Project Alternatives Considered. The option of constructing a road of lower technical \nclass instead of the project expressway was considered but rejected for the following reasons: \n(i) The only road classes with the capacity to carry traffic up to 2020 are four-lane expressways \nor four-lane class-I roads; after 2020, an expressway standard would be required. (ii) The major \ndifference between the expressway and class-I according to MOC design standard is that  \nclass-I may be only partly access-controlled whereas expressway class must be fully access-\n                                                 \n17 GPCD has offered, for construction either as joint ventures or build-operate-transfer projects, three planned \nexpressways as well as eight existing expressways for operation (toll right transfer). \n18 In Sichuan, the project expressway will connect the planned expressway from Guanzigou to Guanguan (56 km, \ntarget completion: 2012). In Gansu, it will connect to the Minxian\u2013Wudu (159 km) and Lintao\u2013Minxian (156 km) \nsections (target completion: 2015). The Lintao\u2013Lanzhou section has opened to traffic. Upon completion of the \nProject, it will connect people along the expressway to Lanzhou through class-II and above highways in Gansu. \n ", "  7 \ncontrolled. Thus, the construction costs for the two options differ only in the number and types of \naccess control by overpass or grade separation, which accounts for only 2.5% of the total cost. \n(iii) Reducing  access  control  and  grade  separation  reduces  capacity  and  safety.  Three \nalternative  alignments  were  also  studied  and  compared  from  technical,  economic,  social, \nenvironmental, and resettlement aspects. The proposed alignment has obvious advantages and \nwas therefore selected. Further, rural roads and township bus stations were selected carefully \nfrom the 11th FYP. \n \n26.  Value Added by ADB. In addition to financing, ADB involvement would (i) strengthen \nGPCD and GCHC in institutional arrangement, human resource development, sound corporate \ngovernance, road maintenance, and management of sector externalities (safety, environment, \nand social dimensions); (ii) integrate rural roads that connect the national high-priority corridor \nand rural poor areas, supporting the Government\u2019s \u201cnew countryside development\u201d initiative; \n(iii) enhance social assessment of road transport design and implementation; and (iv) accelerate \npolicy reforms to improve road transport services. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n27.  The Project will promote sustainable economic growth and reduce poverty in southern \nGansu. It will develop an efficient, safe, and reliable road transport system. The proposed \nexpressway with the total length of 134 km will reduce the trip length from Wudu to Guanzigou \nby 136 km, and resulting of time savings of at least 5 to 7 hours. It will also improve rural access \nto markets, income-earning opportunities, education and health services, and social activities. \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n28.  The Project will (i) build a 134-km four-lane access-controlled toll expressway between \nWudu and Guanzigou, and its tunnels (including one that is 8 km), bridges, interchanges with \ntoll stations, connector roads, administrative stations, and service areas; (ii) upgrade 357 km of \nrural  roads  to  improve  access  to  27  townships  and  275  villages  in  poor  areas;  (iii)  build \n200 township bus stations to provide new bus services; (iv) improve transport services by pilot-\ntesting  a  road  transport  action  plan  in  Longnan;  (v)  promote  corporate  governance;  and \n(vi) strengthen  local  transport  authorities  in  construction  supervision,  road  safety,  asset \nmanagement, and project management by providing consulting services and training. \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n29.  Enhancing Accessibility to Low-Income Areas. Lack of roads feeding into the main \nroad  networks  has  been  identified  as  a  serious  constraint  on  economic  development  and \npoverty reduction in the project area. The Project includes a rural road improvement program, \ncomprising seven road sections totaling 357 km, linking 27 townships and 275 villages. Rural \nroads  were  selected  on  the  basis  of  road  network  efficiency,  economic  potential,  and  the \nsurrounding  poverty  incidence  and  population  density.  These  roads  will  connect  to  the \nexpressway through the road network system. About 763,000 rural people, of whom 52% are \npoor, will directly benefit. \n \n30.  The  rural  roads  will  (i)  be  upgraded  to  classes-III\u2013IV;  (ii)  use  the  MOC  technical \nstandards and follow national competitive bidding procedures that are acceptable to ADB; \n(iii) follow ADB\u2019s social safeguard policies; and (iv) be monitored and evaluated to ensure \nproper design, supervision, and impact monitoring. Planning, improvement, and maintenance \n ", "8   \nwill be highly consultative. Of the ADB loan, $15 million will finance the upgrading of the Wudu\u2013\nLixian section from unclassified or earth track to class-III or class-IV. The upgrading will include \nimproved road subgrade, sealed pavement and improved drainage, rehabilitation of bridges, \nculverts, and traffic safety facilities. The improved road will reduce the distance from Wudu to \nLixian by 23 km (from 164 km to 141 km), not only providing the shortest route for traffic from \nTianshui, the second largest city in Gansu, to Wudu and beyond, but also improving transport \nservices and stimulating other socioeconomic activities (Appendix 6). \n \n31.  Improving Rural Transport Service. Rural transport services are underdeveloped in \nGansu. In Longnan, 129 townships do not have any bus stations. Currently, passengers board \nbuses on roadsides or at temporary stops which is highly unsafe. The bus service is informal, \ncharges are irregular and sometimes exorbitant, and the frequency is uncertain. The Project will \nbuild 200 township bus stations: 100 in Longnan, 50 in Tianshui, and 50 in Dingxi. The total \ninvestment is estimated at $10 million, of which $5 million will be funded from the ADB loan. The \nimproved bus stations and rural roads will provide a more reliable, safe, convenient and regular \nbus service to the local residents. New and improved rural transport services will help the rural \npeople raise their income (Appendix 4). \n \n32.  Sustaining Rural Road Maintenance. Building on new national policy for funding and \nmanaging rural road maintenance announced by the State Council in October 2005, GPCD has \nprepared a provincial regulation and submitted it to the Gansu provincial government (GPG) for \napproval. Under the Project, a rural road maintenance plan was prepared and agreed with \nGPCD to strengthen the sustainability of the rural network in the project area by (i) developing a \nfunctional core rural road network as a base for establishing a road maintenance management \nsystem and assigning priorities and budgets; (ii) compiling road inventories and basic-condition \ndata, and assigning a sub-network manager for each road; (iii) enhancing rural road safety \nfacilities in the mountainous region; (iv) preparing a rural road maintenance manual by the \ninternational  consultant  and  providing  on-the-job  training  to  sub-network  managers,  small \nmaintenance  companies,  and  communities;  (v) conducting  a  200  person-months  training \nprogram for sub-network managers during project implementation; (vi) improving the efficiency \nof  use  of  existing  funds;  and  (vii)  promoting  preventive  maintenance,  including  control  of \noverloading vehicles and timely maintenance during the rainy and winter seasons (Appendix 7). \n \n33.  Tendering  for  Road  Maintenance.  The  Project  will  improve  road  maintenance \noperations  by  conducting  competitive  bidding  for  road  maintenance  with  private  sector \nparticipation. Maintenance works were previously done by GPCD through force account. For the \nsake of efficiency, the Project will develop standard bidding documents for procurement of \nperformance-based  road  maintenance  contracts  with  the  help  of  international  consultants. \nPrivate  sector  participation  in  bidding  for  road  maintenance  will  enhance  competition  and \nimprove quality (Appendix 7). \n \n34.  Adopting an Intelligent Transport System. An intelligent transport system (ITS)19 on \nexpressways is being introduced in accordance with the national ITS architecture prepared by \nthe National ITS Center. ITS objectives in Gansu during the 11th FYP are to (i) introduce a \nnetwork-wide expressway tolling system; (ii) reduce toll payment delay; (iii) improve safety \nthrough  better  monitoring;  (iv) improve  traveler  information;  (v)  assist  in  emergencies;  and \n(vi) improve traffic enforcement, infrastructure maintenance, and computerized management of \nserious incidents. ITS equipment and training will be provided under the Project with the help of \nconsulting services, including (i) integrated traffic control centers; (ii) advanced toll payment; \n                                                 \n19  The application of information technology to transport is referred to as ITS, which provides the ability to gather, \norganize, analyze, use, and share information about transport systems and their efficient use. \n ", "  9 \n(iii) variable message displays; (iv) use of surveillance technology; (v) detection of blackspot \nlocations and weather conditions; and (vi) monitoring of speed limit, overloaded vehicles, toll \npayment,  and  road  safety.  The  ITS  will  produce  key  monitoring  reports,  such  as  traffic \ncomposition and number of road accidents (Supplementary Appendix B). \n \n35.  Developing Asset Management. Proper asset management is fundamental to ensure \nroad sustainability. During the project implementation, GPCD will prepare an asset management \ndevelopment plan, which will establish a computerized database system and promote the use of \nmodern  equipment,  and  provide  a  training  program  for  provincial,  county,  and  township \nemployees. GPCD will assign the Gansu Communications Technical Vocational College to \ndevelop  a  training  program  to  improve  road  asset  management  skills  with  the  help  of \ninternational consultants. Equipment for the computerized system is included in the project \nscope and will be financed by the Project (Supplementary Appendix B). \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n \n36.  The  project  investment  cost  is  estimated  at  $1,660  million  equivalent,  including \ncontingencies, interest, and other charges during construction (Appendix 8). \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem  Amountsa \nA.

Financing Plan \n \n37.  The  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $300 million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources to help finance the Project. The Borrower of the loan will be the PRC. The loan will \nhave  a  25-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.75% per annum, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the \ndraft Loan and Project Agreements. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for \nits decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and \nconditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not \nmade in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n ", "10  \n38.  The ADB loan will finance 18% of the total project cost. The remaining cost will be \nfinanced by MOC and GPG, and cofinancing through a loan from Bank of Communications \n(Table 2). MOC and GPG have made budgetary provisions for the counterpart funds. The ADB \nloan proceeds will be made available to GPG, which will, through GPCD, onlend the proceeds \nof the loan to GCHC under an onlending agreement on the same financial terms and conditions \nas those of the ADB loan, with the GCHC bearing the exchange rate and interest rate variation \nrisks and performing the obligations applicable to it in the Project Agreement which are made an \nintegral part of the onlending agreement. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Total  % \nAsian Development Bank  300.00  18 \nBank of Communications  712.60  43 \nMinistry of Communications  332.00  20 \nGansu Provincial Government  315.40  19 \n  Total  1,660.00  100 \n  Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management \n \n39.  GPCD will be the Executing Agency and responsible for the overall implementation of \nthe Project. GCHC, the Implementing Agency responsible for the ongoing ADB-financed Gansu \nRoads  Development  Project,20 will  also  be  the  Implementing  Agency  for  the  proposed \nexpressway under the Project. GCHC\u2019s general manager, acting as the project director, will be \nresponsible for construction and operation of the expressway. GPCD will implement the rural \nroad component through the Gansu Provincial Highway Administration Bureau and the transport \nservice component through the Gansu Provincial Transport Administration Bureau. A project \nimplementation  unit  established  within  GCHC  will  monitor  and  follow  up  implementation; \nfacilitate land acquisition, resettlement, and environmental protection; and ensure that local \nconcerns are addressed adequately. The unit will be headed by a project manager, who will \noversee day-to-day physical implementation. Organization charts for GPCD and GCHC are in \nSupplementary Appendix C. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n40.  The Project will be implemented over 5 years, from January 2007 to December 2011. The \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 9. \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n41.  All ADB-financed procurement will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines.21 A list of ADB-\nfinanced contract packages is in Appendix 10. The main civil works contracts will be divided into \n24 packages, which will be procured using international competitive bidding (ICB). The four \npavement packages and two equipment packages will also be procured through ICB. All other \npackages\u2014four  traffic  management  facilities;  four  afforestation  and  landscaping  works;  six \nbuilding and ancillary facilities; and four tolling, monitoring, and communication systems\u2014will be \n                                                 \n20  ADB. 2004.

The Wudu\u2013Lixian section financed by ADB will be procured through NCB, for which \nADB will require prior review of the bid evaluation report and award of contracts. The other \nsections financed by GPCD will be procured through Government procedures acceptable to \nADB. Township bus stations financed by ADB will be procured through shopping. International \nbidding will be handled by a tendering company that is well qualified to perform these tasks. The \nrelevant sections of ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy will be included in all documents and contracts \nrelated  to  project  bidding  and  implementation.  A  procurement  plan  is  in  Supplementary \nAppendix D. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n \n42.  The Project will finance 56 person-months of international consulting services: 40 for \nsupervision of the civil works, 6 each for bridge construction and tunnel construction, and 2 each \nfor road safety and road maintenance. GPCD will engage and finance 7,600 person-months of \nnational consultants, 350 of which will be allocated for rural roads and transport services, \n320 for environmental protection, and 30 to monitor the socioeconomic and poverty impacts. \nThe international consultants will be financed by the ADB loan and selected and engaged based \non a full technical proposal using the quality- and cost-based selection method in accordance \nwith ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.22 The national consultants will be financed \nfrom domestic resources and will be recruited in accordance with Government procedures \nacceptable to ADB. GCHC will establish two resident supervision engineer offices. The chief \nsupervision  engineer\u2019s  office  will  be  responsible  for  overall  project  supervision.  The  chief \nsupervision engineer will be assisted by two deputies, one of whom will be the team leader of \nthe international consultants. The team leader will help the chief supervision engineer with \nproject and contract management activities during project implementation. Outline terms of \nreferences for consultants are in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \n  5.  Advance Action and Retroactive Financing \n \n43.  On 24 May 2006, ADB approved advance procurement for civil works and retroactive \nfinancing for eligible expenditures related to civil works up to $30 million incurred before the loan \neffectivity date, but not earlier than 12 months before the date of loan agreement signing. The \nadvance  action  will  be  done  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines.  The \nGovernment has been advised that approval of the advance action and retroactive financing \ndoes not commit ADB to financing the Project. \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n44.  The loan will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook.23 \nBecause  most  of  the  payments  will  be  made  for  large  contracts,  direct  payments, \nreimbursements,  and  commitment  procedures  will  be  used  to  withdraw  loan  funds.  If \ngovernment funds are used first for eligible expenditures, ADB\u2019s reimbursement procedure will \nbe followed. To expedite the flow of funds, the statement of expenditures procedure may be \nused  to  reimburse  eligible  expenditures  for  any  individual  payment  not  exceeding \n$100,000 equivalent. Before disbursement, the Borrower shall have certified to ADB that the \nonlending agreement, which shall include the terms and conditions required under the loan \nagreement, shall have been duly executed and delivered on behalf of GPG and the GCHC, and \nshall have become fully effective and binding upon the parties thereto in accordance with its \nterms. \n                                                 \n22  ADB. 2006. Guidelines on Use of Consultants. Manila (as amended from time to time). \n23 ADB. 2001. Loan Disbursement Handbook. Manila. \n ", "12  \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n45.  GPCD and GCHC will maintain separate accounts for the Project and related financial \nstatements,  and  will  have  them  audited  annually  in  accordance  with  auditing  standards \nconsistently applied by independent auditors, whose qualifications, experience, and terms of \nreference are acceptable to ADB. GPCD and GCHC will submit to ADB within 6 months of the \nend  of  each  related  fiscal  year,  certified  copies  of  audited  project  accounts  and  financial \nstatements and an auditor\u2019s report on the Project, all in English. A separate audit opinion on the \nuse of the statement of expenditures, if any, will be included as part of the auditor\u2019s report. \nDuring the project implementation, GPCD and GCHC will submit quarterly progress reports. To \nfacilitate project post-evaluation, GPCD and GCHC will furnish ADB with a completion report \nwithin 3 months of the end of the Project. \n \n  8.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n46.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy 24 was explained to and discussed with the local and central \ngovernments.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. To support these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations \nand the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in \nconnection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and \nexamine the records and accounts of GPCD, GCHC, and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, \nand other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n47.  GPCD will (i) establish a supervisory body to prevent undue interference in business \npractices and to ensure that adequate resources are made available for its effective operation; \n(ii) involve a leading group of officials from the Supervision Division of GPCD, located in GCHC, \ninvolved in bidding, construction, and other operational activities; (iii) hold regular briefings with \nGPCD, GCHC, and the prosecutor\u2019s office to share information on or warnings about corrupt \npractices; (iv) periodically inspect contractors\u2019 fund withdrawals and settlement activities; and \n(v) adopt a two-contract system whereby the winner of a civil works contract must also sign an \nanticorruption contract with the employer. \n \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n48.  To  demonstrate  the  effectiveness  of  its  operations  and  to  be  accountable  for  its \nperformance to stakeholders, ADB uses the project performance management system (PPMS). \nThe monitoring will use a combined macro and micro approach, the latter focusing on a few key \nrepresentative communities. A basic monitoring framework was constructed for the Project to \npermit a more definitive assessment of the actual benefits. GPCD and GCHC have agreed with \nthe (i) monitoring framework, (ii) set of indicators to be used to monitor and evaluate the \nproject\u2019s  impacts,  and  (iii)  representative  villages.  Indicators  were  selected  based  on  the \nfindings of the ADB-financed TA for the socioeconomic assessment of road projects25 and \nproject preparatory TA findings. The baseline values for the indicators were established, where \navailable,  during  project  preparation,  and  will  be  updated  prior  to  and  during  project \nimplementation, at project completion, and annually for 3 years thereafter. By 30 September \n2007, GPCD will recruit an independent local institute to provide 30 person-months for surveys, \n                                                 \n24  ADB. 1998. Anticorruption. Manila (as amended to date). \n25  ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Socioeconomic Assessment of Road \nProjects. Manila. \n ", "  13 \nanalyses, and reporting. Reports summarizing the key findings will be submitted to ADB. GPCD, \nGCHC, and local governments have assured ADB that monitoring will be adequate in the project \narea and in selected communities (Appendix 11). \n \n  10.  Project Review \n \n49.  Two years after the Project starts, GPCD, GCHC, and ADB will carry out a midterm \nproject  review,  focusing  on  policy,  institutional,  administrative,  organizational,  technical, \nenvironmental, social, economic, financial, and other relevant factors that may have an impact \non the project\u2019s performance and its continuing viability. The review will examine progress in \nreform, resettlement, and compliance with assurances in the loan and project agreements. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Traffic Forecast \n \n50.  The project expressway will form part of the shortest route connecting northwest to \ndynamic  southwest  of  the  PRC.  Gansu  has  coordinated  with  Sichuan  and  reached  an \nagreement to implement the Guanzigou\u2013Guangyuan expressway as it is planned in conjunction \nwith the project expressway construction. The traffic volume on the expressway is expected to \ngrow from an average of 5,500 passenger car units (pcu) in 2012 to an average of 11,200 pcu in \n2022, a 7.4% average annual growth rate. It will grow at 7.2% per annum thereafter to reach an \naverage of 22,500 pcu in 2032 (Appendix 12). \n \nB.  Economic Analysis \n \n51.  The  project\u2019s  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  was  estimated  by  comparing \nscenarios  with  and  without  the  Project.  Without  the  Project,  traffic  volume  would  exceed \ncapacity of the existing NH212, congestion would worsen, causing delay, thereby increasing \ntravel time, vehicle operating costs (VOCs), and accidents. With the Project, travel time and \nVOCs would be reduced because of higher speeds and shorter distances; the accident rate \nwould be reduced by eliminating congestion, providing safety features, and separating fast and \nslow traffic. Similar benefits will also accrue to the traffic on the existing roads. The project\u2019s \neconomic costs reflect (i) the capital cost for construction, which include physical contingencies, \nland  acquisition,  and  resettlement;  (ii)  O&M  costs,  which  include  replacing  depreciated \nequipment; and (iii) environmental monitoring costs. The economic benefits are (i) savings in \nVOCs as a result of reduced road length and improved traffic and road conditions, (ii) time \nsavings for road users, (iii) savings in road accident costs as a result of fewer accidents, and \n(iv) benefits from generated traffic.  \n \n52.  The Project is economically viable. The EIRR for the whole Project is estimated at 17.9%. \nThe EIRR was 17.5% for the expressway and 23.0% for the local road network. Sensitivity \nanalysis confirms the robustness of the project\u2019s economic viability. To determine the degree of \nuncertainty for the Project, a risk analysis was conducted. The results of the risk analysis show \nthat the probability of the EIRR to be below 12% is 6.1% (Appendix 13). \n \nC.  Financial Analysis and Projections \n \n53.  In accordance with the Highway Law and Regulations on Toll Road Management in PRC, \ntoll rates will be set based on various factors such as technical standard of highway, project cost, \nlocal price index, duration to pay the loans, traffic volume and affordability. The proposed toll \n ", "14  \nrates26 for the project expressway are considered reasonable to attract sufficient traffic to meet \nthe criteria for EIRR and financial internal rate of return (FIRR). GCHC will undertake a toll \nanalysis before opening the expressway, and each year for 5 years thereafter, to confirm the \nappropriate level of toll, and it will submit the results for ADB\u2019s review and comments. If an \nadjustment of the toll levels is required based on this principle, GCHC will obtain ADB\u2019s review \nand comments before finalizing and submitting it to GPG for approval. \n \n54.  Financial projections have been prepared in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for the \nFinancial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects  to  assess  the  financial  viability  and \nsustainability of the Project. The projected financial statements indicate that financial revenues \nwill be sufficient to cover O&M costs and debt service from the six year of operation. The \nproject\u2019s cost estimates and financial projections in nominal terms were converted to real terms \nby adjusting for the projected effects of foreign and domestic inflation and currency fluctuations. \nThe expressway FIRR is estimated at about 4.6% after taxes\u2014better than the weighted average \ncost of capital of 3.4%, also net of taxes. The expressway is considered to be financially viable \nand sustainable. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the FIRR is robust under adverse conditions \n(Appendix 14). Financial management assessment found that the Project meets the minimum \nfinancial management requirements and can provide accurate and timely information on its \nstatus in the reporting format agreed with ADB (Supplementary Appendix F). \n \nD.  Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy \n \n55.  Socioeconomic Profile. The Project will benefit 2.7 million people in Longnan, of whom \n2.4 million live in rural areas and 996,700 of these live on less than $1 per person per day.27 In \naddition, 50 township bus stations in each of Dingxi and Tianshui prefectures will benefit a \nfurther 1.9 million people. Of the more than 4.6 million project beneficiaries, 1.7 million are poor. \nThe GDP per capita is CNY2,346 in Longnan, CNY3,619 in Tianshui, and CNY2,126 in Dingxi. \nSeven out of nine counties in Longnan, six out of seven counties in Tianshui, and all seven \ncounties in Dingxi are nationally designated poverty counties. The incidence of rural poverty is \n42% in Longnan, 29% in Tianshui, and 39% in Dingxi. There are 3,237 villages in Longnan, \n75%  of  which  are  nationally  designated  poverty  villages.  Once  linked  to  the  major  road \nnetworks, the improved rural transport system will spread the expressway\u2019s benefits to the local \neconomy and rural communities (Appendix 15). \n \n56.  Stakeholder Consultations. Over 5,000 people were interviewed during public opinion \nsurveys,  social  and  environmental  assessment,  resettlement  planning,  and  social  surveys \n(Supplementary Appendix G). Discussions have shown that support for the Project is strong \nbecause the area is isolated. The primary needs of the local people included jobs and better \ninfrastructure. The Project will (i) ensure adequate and timely compensation for land acquisition; \n(ii) hire villagers for construction and source local materials during the Project; (iii) develop small \nbusiness and tourism; (iv) enhance access to markets, jobs, schools and health care facilities; \nand (v) provide overpasses, underpasses, culverts, and interchanges to expressway facilities.28 \n \n57.  Social Benefits. The Project will create 56,000 person-years of job opportunities during \nthe construction and 1,700 full-time jobs during the operation. Over 60% of the jobs will be filled \nup by the poor with an estimated total of CNY200 million in wage payment annually during \nconstruction,  and  another  CNY15  million  in  wage  payment  annually  after  start  of  project \n                                                 \n26  The proposed toll rates are CNY0.35\u2013CNY2 per vehicle-km. Under the current Gansu provincial \u201cgreen passage\u201d \nregulations, local vehicles carrying fresh agricultural produce or livestock are exempt from tolls (Appendix 14).   \n27  In Longnan, 321,000 absolutely poor people live below CNY625 per capita per year and 676,000 poor people live \nbelow CNY825 per capita per year (996,700 live below the international poverty line of $1 per year per day). \n28  The Project will provide seven interchanges, including two interchanges in Wudu, with a minimum spacing of 5 km. \n ", "  15 \noperation. Local procurement of the materials required for the Project is estimated value of \nCNY200 million, of which 60% is value added in labor. In addition, the construction tax revenue \nto be collected by local governments is estimated at CNY248 million. This additional revenue \nwill be used for poverty reduction and social activities, with special attention to resettlement \naffected groups, women, and other vulnerable people. The improved road transport system will \nenhance the local investment climate to attract more investment to the region and act as a \ncatalyst for future investment. \n \n58.  Capacity Building for Rural Communities. A reluctance among many residents to \naccept new ideas, low willingness to learn new skills, and lack of confidence are among key \nconstraints to reducing poverty. The Project will (i) disseminate information widely to the general \npublic  via  the  mass  media;  (ii)  motivate  community  interest,  support,  and  participation; \n(iii) improve information flows regarding markets, jobs, government policies and initiatives, and \naid programs; and (iv) develop and train local small contractors. Local skills are expected to be \ngreatly enhanced as a result of several years of employment in project-related activities.  \n \n59.  Control  and  Mitigation  of  Epidemic  Diseases.  Improved  transport  and  greater \npopulation mobility might put the residents at risk of acquiring sexually transmitted infections, \nincluding HIV/AIDS. No HIV/AIDS cases have been reported in the project area. The Gansu \nCenter  for  Disease  Control  implements  preventive  measures  and  adopts  tight  health  and \nhygiene standards. Such measures include providing education programs; distributing condoms \nto  local  residents;  monitoring  any  outbreaks  and  spread  of  disease;  regularly  inspecting \nconstruction  sites;  using  advocacy  and  awareness  programs;  and  providing  voluntary \ncounseling, testing kits, and education. In carrying out the civil work contracts, the Law on the \nPrevention and Treatment of Epidemic Diseases will be followed (Appendix 16).29   \n \n60.  Ethnic Minorities and Gender Development. Ethnic minorities, predominantly Tibetan \nand Hui Muslims, account for 2% of the population in Longnan. They will not be negatively \naffected by the Project. They do not live along the expressway or rural road alignments, so they \nwill not be affected by land acquisition and resettlement. However, special measures will be \ntaken to include them as project beneficiaries (Appendix 16). The Project will also give women \ngreater access to markets, information, jobs, education and health services. It will help them \ndiversify into cash crops and agroprocessing. The Project will ensure equal job opportunities for \nwomen and ethnic minorities during project construction and operation. \n \n61.  Small Business Development. The project area has potential for small businesses to \ngrow rapidly, but they have been constrained by an inefficient transport system. The Project will \ntake initiatives to stimulate (i) export-oriented cash crops and agro-industry; (ii) community-\nbased tourism and eco-tourism; and (iii) services (restaurants, kiosk, and car repair shops) at \ninterchanges, along rural roads and next to township bus stations (Appendix 17). \n \nE.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n \n62.  This  is  an  involuntary  resettlement  category  A  project.  GPCD  has  prepared  a \nresettlement plan for the project expressway and a resettlement plan for the rural roads and \ntownship bus stations (Appendix 18 and Supplementary Appendix H). The project expressway \nwill cross 83 villages in Wudu district and Wenxian county in Longnan. An estimated 681 ha will \nbe permanently acquired. Based on the PRC standard for impact assessment, 2,834 people will \nlose all their land and agricultural livelihood; since the actual impact will be about one-third loss, \n                                                 \n29  GPCD will ensure that contractors disseminate information to their employees on the risks of sexually transmitted \ninfections and HIV/AIDS. Local public health offices will disseminate similar information to transport operators, and \nlocal communities, especially women, in the project area.  \n ", "16  \nan estimated number affected is 8,500 people. About 15,130 square meters of houses will be \ndemolished, requiring the relocation of 151 households with 621 people. No factories or school \nbuildings will be affected. The upgrading of 357 km of rural roads will require relocating about \n100 households  with  400 people,  and  another  500  people  will  be  partly  affected  by  land \nacquisition. The 200 township bus stations do not require land acquisition but will obtain land-\nuse rights for existing construction land in each town. \n \n63.  GCHC, in conjunction with the local government land administration bureaus, will be \nresponsible for resettlement for the project expressway. The estimated resettlement cost is \nCNY387 million ($48.3 million equivalent), including taxes and contingencies. The resettlement \ncost for the rural roads and township bus stations is CNY12.4 million ($1.55 million equivalent). \nSince both resettlement plans are based on feasibility studies, GPCD and GCHC must prepare \nand submit updated resettlement plans to ADB for approval before land acquisition and civil \nworks. The resettlement budgets will be adjusted based on the actual measurement of physical \nlosses and approved compensation rates. Affected persons (AP) were consulted during the \npreparation of feasibility studies, and resettlement information was disclosed to them by the \nmedia in April and May 2006. GPCD and GCHC will be responsible for internal supervision and \nmonitoring. Progress reports will be prepared and submitted to ADB quarterly until resettlement \nis completed. GCHC will then prepare a resettlement completion report. GCHC will contract an \nindependent agency for external monitoring and evaluation, and to prepare monitoring reports \nfor submission to GPCD and ADB every 6 months until resettlement is completed. Thereafter, \nannual evaluation investigations will be conducted for at least 2 years and reported to GPCD \nand ADB. \n \nF.  Environmental Assessment and Management Plan \n \n64.  The Project falls under environmental category A. The environmental impact assessment \n(EIA)  was  prepared  by  GPCD  and  approved  by  the  State  Environmental  Protection \nAdministration on 3 July 2006. Initial environmental examinations (IEEs) for rural road and bus \nstations were also prepared. A summary EIA for the Project was prepared and circulated to the \nBoard and made public through ADB's website on 31 May 2006. The EIA and IEEs assessed \nthe environmental impact of the selected alignments of the expressway, the rural roads and the \nbus stations, and prescribed environmental protection and mitigation measures, which cost \n$85.6 million. The proposed alignment, rural roads, and bus stations do not cross or are not in \nany protected areas; there are no known rare or endangered species in the project areas. To \nensure that all potential adverse environmental impacts are mitigated, GPCD will implement the \nenvironmental management plans (EMP) as specified in the EIA. The EMP will be incorporated \nin the bidding documents and contracts for civil works. \n \nG.  Risks \n \n65.  The project design has considered potential technical, economic, financial, and social \nrisks. The main technical risks are associated with the design and construction of the many \nproject tunnels, particularly the 8 km Myaziliang tunnel. To minimize technical risks, (i) the \nProject will be implemented by experienced staff members; (ii) preliminary design will focus on \ngeotechnical  investigations;  (iii)  an  international  tunnel  consultant  will  help  prepare  a  risk \nmanagement  plan;  (iv)  the  prequalification  of  contractors  will  focus  on  their  financial  and \ntechnical capabilities in handling similar works; (v) a contract management information system \nwill help identify technical problems and implement corrective measures on time; and (vi) given \nthe safety hazards associated with tunnel works, the contractors will be required to strictly \nenforce  working  safety  rules  and measures.  To  control  the  financial  risks,  the Project  will \n(i) strengthen contract and cost management to control potential cost overrun, (ii) inject more \n ", "  17 \nequity into the Project, (iii) introduce a market-based approach to formulate toll pricing policy \nand regular review of toll levels to ensure cost recovery, and (iv) build a business environment \nto  generate  non-toll  revenues  along  the  expressway  alignment.  The  social  issues  include \nresettlement  and  HIV/AIDS  infection.  Appropriate  mitigation  measures  are  in  place  in  the \nresettlement plan, SDAP, and EMP. GPCD and GCHC demonstrated a high level of ownership \nin preparing and committing to implement these action plans. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES30 \n \n66.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government, GPG, GPCD, and GCHC have \ngiven the following specific assurances.  \n \n67.  Counterpart Financing. The Government will, and GPG, through GPCD and GCHC, \nwill, ensure that provision of all funds and resources necessary for construction, O&M, and \nmanagement of the Project on a timely basis, and shall take all necessary measures, including \nthe  provision  of  additional  funds,  to  ensure  that  the  GPCD  and  GCHC  can  successfully \nimplement the Project, and operate and manage it after completion. \n \n68.  Construction Quality. GPG, through GPCD will ensure that (i) the project expressway, \nrural roads and bus stations are constructed in accordance with the MOC\u2019s technical standards; \nand (ii) the project construction supervision, quality control, and contract management are \nconducted in accordance with national standards and internationally accepted practices. \n \n69.  Transport Services. GPG, through GPCD will ensure that adequate transport services \nwill be in place so that the project\u2019s benefits will filter down to the rural poor in the project area. \nGPCD will coordinate with other agencies to implement the rural transport services development \nplan. In particular, GPG, through GPCD, will implement the planned public transport facilities in \ntandem with the Project. \n \n70.  Road Transport Policy Reform. GPCD will ensure that the road transport action plan \nprepared under ADB-financed TA for policy reform in road transport is implemented in Longnan \nprefecture, if necessary with suitable amendments in consultation with ADB, to improve the road \ntransport efficiency. \n \n71.  Road Safety. Prior to construction and operation of the project expressway and rural \nroads, GPG will cause GPCD to (i) establish a road safety inter-agency committee to facilitate \nthe project implementation, and (ii) ensure that the independent road safety audits be carried \nout and recommendations of these audits are taken into account during project construction and \noperations. At least 6 months prior to the opening of the expressway, GPG will, (i) through \nGPCD, develop and implement a plan to ensure safe operation of road infrastructure facilities; \nand (ii) establish a sufficient number of teams of traffic police personnel, in accordance with \nnational law and GPG standards, to patrol the project expressway and rural roads and enforce \nthe national regulations. \n \n72.

Overview. Investment in road infrastructure during the Tenth Five-Year Plan (10th FYP, \n2001\u20132005) reached CNY1,900 billion, more than double that in the previous 5 years. By the \nend of 2005, the road network reached 1.93 million kilometer (km). Road density increased from \n12.1 km per 100  square kilometer (km2) in 1995 to 20.0 km per 100 km2 in 2005. However, the \ndensity of the road network ranks among the lowest in the world relative to either population or \ngeographic area, particularly in the western region. With a total length of 41,330 km, Gansu\u2019s \nroad network accounted for 2.1% of the country\u2019s total roads. Road density in Gansu was \n9.1 km per 100 km2, significantly lower than the national average.  \n \n2.  Road Transport. Despite efforts to increase transport capacity, serious constraints and \nbottlenecks remain, especially in the road sector. Expressways account for 2% of the total road \nnetwork, class-I highways for 2%, and class-II highways for 13%. About 83% of the remaining \nroads are medium- to low-grade paved road and gravel roads. Because of rapid economic \ngrowth since 1978, demand for transport services has increased many times.1 The privately \nowned fleet increased nearly 80 times, from 0.3 million to 23.7 million during 1985\u20132005. Road \npassenger traffic in Gansu grew by 6.4% per annum during 1990\u20132005, lower than the national \naverage of 9.0%. Road freight traffic, in ton-km, grew at 6.0% per year during the same period, \ncompared with 6.2% per year for the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) as a whole. In 2005, \nthere were 457,700 trucks and passenger vehicles in Gansu, or 1.8 vehicles per 100 people, \nlower than national average of 2.4 vehicles per 100 persons. Privately owned vehicles in Gansu \ntotaled 247,300 in 2005. \n \n3.  Government  Sector  Development  Strategy.  The  Government  key  sector  strategy \nduring the 10th FYP is the development of a national trunk highway system (NTHS) to connect \n12 provincial capitals with a population of 500,000 or more. By the end of 2005, 31,000 km of \nthe NTHS had been completed and the total NTHS will be completed by 2007. In 2001, the \nMinistry of Communications (MOC) released plans to construct the western region corridor \ntotaling 17,500 km. Much of the proposed construction is directed as part of the Government\u2019s \nWestern Region Development Strategy. By the end of 2005, 11,000 km of class-II and above \nhighways had been completed and the remaining sections will be completed by 2010. In 2005, \nthe  State  Council  approved  the  National  Expressway  Network  Program  to  expand  the \nexpressway network to 85,000 km by 2020. The program aims to connect all cities with a \npopulation of 200,000 or more. Priority will be given to developing expressways in poor, less \ndeveloped interior regions that lack transport. By the end of 2005, 33,000 km of expressway had \nbeen completed and the rest will be constructed by 2020. \n \n4.  Rural  Road  Network.  Rural  roads  are  underdeveloped:  38,426 villages  and \n75 townships, most of which are in western region, are not connected with roads. Out of \n1.56 million  km  of  the  total  rural  roads  (county  roads  and  below),  80%  are  class-IV  and \nunclassified,  and  60%  of  which  have  some  level  of  gravel  surfacing  or  are  unpaved. \nRecognizing the importance of improved rural roads to poverty reduction and reducing the gap \nbetween rural and urban economy, the Government announced plans in 2003 for 5,300 rural \nroad projects, with a total length of 78,000 km. The Government will accelerate the rural road \nimprovement. In accordance with the National Rural Road Development Plan during 2006\u20132010, \na total of 2.4 million km of rural roads will be upgraded with a total investment of CNY800 billion. \nOf this, CNY140 billion will be provided by the central government. The plan is that by 2010, \npaved roads will reach all of townships across the country, as well as all villages in eastern \nregion, 88% of villages in the central region and 50% of villages in the western region. Villages \nin the western region will at least have access to roads by 2010. \n                                                 \n1  Road freight traffic increased from 27.4 billion ton-km in 1978 to 869.3 billion ton-km (32 times) in 2005. Road \npassenger traffic increased from 52.1 billon passenger-km in 1978 to 929.2 billion passenger-km (18 times). \n ", "  Appendix 2  25 \n5.  Rural Transport Services. Poor road conditions have resulted in inadequate transport \nin  rural  poor  areas.  Because  of  poor  roads,  low  demand,  high  operating  costs,  transport \noperators are unwilling to provide services or are not permitted to do so for safety reasons. \nOther issues are inadequate transport facilities, lack of competition in the transport service \nmarket, and regulations on tariff, routes, and schedules for bus services, which have led to \ninefficient use of vehicles. MOC has prepared the national rural transport services development \nplan for 2006\u20132010, under which township bus stations will connect all townships, and bus \nstops will connect all villages. This will further enhance benefit flowing to the rural poor. \n \n6.  Road  Maintenance.  Although  maintenance  expenditure  increased  significantly  in \nabsolute terms in the past decade, its share of road expenditures decreased. While highways \nare relatively well maintained, rural road maintenance remains a challenge. In 2005, the State \nCouncil called for reform of rural road maintenance. MOC is closely coordinating with provincial \ngovernments to implement the policy. MOC is organizing a nationwide rural road survey to \ndevelop the rural road database, which will be introduced in stages to all provinces. \n \n7.  Resource Mobilization. Despite massive investment in the road sector (3% of gross \ndomestic product on average in 2001\u20132005), funding is still insufficient to meet the demand. \nDuring the 10th FYP, state subsidy and vehicle purchase tax provided 14% of the financing, and \nthe rest was financed by provincial resources (42%), domestic loans (42%), and foreign loans \n(2%). The growing demand for transport infrastructure will require the sector to shift from the \nconventional financing modes toward the capital markets and private sector investment. Bond \nissues are also suitable for road projects because of their long-term and stable earning streams. \nHowever, any capital market instrument requires an adequate legal and regulatory framework, \npublic disclosure, and strong credit standing. Further reforms are needed in policy, regulation, \nand  pricing  to  encourage  financing  from  diversified  resources,  reduce  inefficiencies,  and \nenhance governance. \n \n8.  Policy Reform. Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been undertaking policy dialogue \non  the  PRC  road  sector  since  1991.

TRANSPORT SERVICES AND POLICY REFORM \n \nA.  Nature of Transport Service \n \n1.  General.  Rural  roads  and  rural  transport  services  form  a  rural  transport  system.  In \nsouthern Gansu, rural roads are poor and transport services are inadequate. Passengers board \nbuses on roadsides, which is dangerous, or at temporary bus stops. In Longnan, 129 townships \ndo not have the lowest-class rural bus station, 820 villages have no direct access to a formal \nbus services as bus operators are unwilling to provide them because of poor roads, resulting in \nhigh  operating  costs  and  safety  concerns.  Transport  demand  is  met  by  various  informal \ntransport services, typically motor-tricycles, agriculture tractors, and dual-purpose pickups. They \nprovide local services between villages and townships for the villagers, and are more expensive \nthan the regulated fare.1 \n \n2.  Transport Demand. Social surveys reveal that the average household makes 48 trips per \nyear, of which 56% were motorized for journey length over 6 km. More than 60% of trips take \nplace close to the nearest town or markets. External trips are fewer. Vehicle ownership is low in \nthe project area.2 Walking and bicycling are the major modes of transport for short trips. As the \ndistance increases, so does the number of motorized trips.  \n \n3.  Passenger Services. Bus fares and routes of the formal bus system are regulated, often \nresulting in inefficient services and low vehicle utilization. Bus fares depend on the type of bus \nand road conditions, with an increase of 20% allowed during holidays. The regulations provide a \nsmall variation between different road classes, e.g., an increase of 5% of base fare is allowed \nfor classes-II\u2013III roads and an increase of 8% of base fare for class-IV and unclassified roads, \nas  against  base  fares  set  on  class-I  and  expressways.  Rural  bus  fares  do  not  reflect \nopportunities  for  improving  vehicle  utilization  and  lowering  unit  operating  costs  through  a \nrelaxation of regulatory restrictions on operations and schedules. Average bus occupancy of \naround 65% for inter-prefecture and inter-county routes. \n \n4.  Importance of Rural Transport System. Improved rural roads provide the physical link \nfrom villages to the higher levels of the road network and hence to the regional and national \neconomy. Since few rural farmers own motor vehicles and rural roads are the only means of \ntransport in the project area, rural transport is the only way that rural households are linked to \nthe wider economy. In Suzhou prefecture in Gansu, seven township bus stations were built in \n2003. This resulted in: (i) per capita annual income increase of CNY100 in 2004, (ii) total freight \ntraffic increased by 300,000 tons and passenger traffic increased by 200,000 people, and \n(iii) average daily passenger traffic per township bus station reached 300. Other social benefits \nare summarized in Table A4.1, which indicates strong empirical evidence to support the social \nand economic justifications for the provision of an efficient rural transport system. \n                                                 \n1  Based on the social surveys, an average unit cost of CNY0.30 per kilometer (km) is paid for trips from a village to a \ntownship center (roughly about 15\u201320 km), which is much higher than regular bus fare for the same distance in \nperiurban areas in Gansu (CNY0.20 and less per km).  \n2  Nearly 40% of households have bicycles, 23% of families own one motorcycle, 20% of families have one animal \ncart, and only 11% of households have one agricultural vehicle. \n ", "  Appendix 4  31 \nTable A4.1: Benefits Resulting from Improved Transport Services \n \nA.

The Project focuses on improvement of township-level transport services in \nsouthern Gansu where people lack mobility and have poor accessibility. The basic conditions for \ntownship bus station development are in place in the project area: relatively high population \ndensity (an average 20,000 people for each township), medium distance between townships \n(about 20 km away in the project area), irrigated agriculture, cash crops, and non-agriculture \nemployment.  The  Project  will  (i)  provide  reliable,  safe  and  more  efficient  bus  services; \n(ii) promote an efficient marketing system\u2014the township bus stations will be close enough to \ntownship markets that rural people can sell their products directly and in a timely manner in  \nmarkets without the need for traders and wholesalers; (iii) improve information exchange by \nproviding a kiosk in each station; and (iv) improve access to socioeconomic activities (education, \nhealth care, employment, and income generation). Local communities are enthusiastic about \ninvesting in bus stations because of their positive impacts on rural development, accessibility, \nand poverty reduction. \n \n6.  Township  Bus  Stations.  The  Project  will  include  the  construction  of  200  class-V \ntownship bus stations,3 with 100 in Longnan, 50 in Tianshui, and 50 in Dingxi. This component \nwill benefit 3.9 million people living in the 200 townships (1.96 million people in Longnan, \n0.99 million in Tianshui, and 0.95 million in Dingxi). The unit cost of a class-V township station is \nestimated  at  CNY400,000  ($50,000  equivalent).  The  total  cost  of  the  transport  service \ncomponent would be CNY80 million ($10 million), of which $5 million will be financed by Asian \nDevelopment Bank loan. The Project will encourage the active participation of local communities \nin planning, implementation, and monitoring. Local communities that invest in the bus stations \nwill  have  priority  in  running  the  business  and  getting  its  profits.  Gansu  Provincial \nCommunications  Department  (GPCD)  agreed  to  ensure  the  bus  stations  construction  are \ncompleted in tandem with the project local roads to ensure the efficient provision of services \nwhen the local roads are built. \n \n7.  Improve Rural Transport Service. Expanding rural transport services is an integral part \nof Gansu\u2019s plan for improving rural transport system. A total of 318 township bus stations had \nbeen constructed and were being operated in Gansu by 31 May 2006: 157 are in southern \nGansu, with 40 out of 169 townships in Longnan, 69 out of 119 townships in Dingxi, and 48 out \n                                                 \n3  Bus centers are classified by design capacity into class-I\u2013V bus stations and bus stops. The design capacity of a \nclass-V station is less than 300 passengers daily with the average construction area of 250 square meters. \n ", "32  Appendix 4 \n \nof 113 townships in Tianshui. GPCD agreed to build all remaining township bus stations by \n2010. \n \n8.  Pilot  Policy  Reform. Asian Development Bank provided assistance for a technical \nassistance on policy reform in road transport.4 The technical assistance reviewed the current \nstatus and issues in road freight and passenger transport, and prepared an action plan of policy \nreform, recommending policy and regulatory measures to improve its efficiency, such as easing \nthe rules that confine buses to individual routes and fixed schedules, thereby reducing the \npotential for improved productivity, and allowing cost savings to be passed on to road users as \nlower fares. In Longnan, which is in difficult mountainous terrain, roads are the only means of \ntransport. Main constraints facing Longnan includes low vehicle use rates and high vehicle \noperating costs. GPCD has agreed to pilot-test some recommendations listed in the action plan \n(Table A4.2).

Overview. Road safety is a serious issue in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). The \nWorld  Health  Organization  estimates  that  road  accidents  cost  the  PRC  economy  from \n$12 billion  to  $21  billion  each  year,  about  1.5%  of  the  gross  domestic  product.1 In  2005, \n98,738 people were killed and 469,911 were injured in 450,254 road accidents.2 Unless urgent \naction is taken, road traffic fatalities in the PRC are predicted to increase to almost half a million \nper  year  by  2020.  Main  causes  of  the  poor  road  safety  are  (i)  lack  of  interdepartmental \ncoordination and ownership; (ii) poor roads; (iii) a shortage of measures such as data systems \nand  monitoring,  road  safety  audit,  inspection  systems;  (iv)  shortage  of  skilled  staff  and \nresources; and (iv) weak enforcement. \n \n2.  Policy Framework. The Government thus created a 15-ministry committee under the \nState Council and promulgated the first Road Traffic Safety Law, which took effect in May \n2004.3 The number of accidents dropped by 13.1% from 2004, the fatality rate decreased by \n7.8%,  and  number  of  injured  diminished  by  2.3%.  In  2005,  Gansu  had  5,414  accidents, \ninvolving 1,799 fatalities and 5,406 injuries, a decrease of 14.3%, 10.0%, and 2.7% from 2004. \nThe reduction in accidents in 2005 is in part attributable to new road safety law, coordinated \ngovernment efforts, and strengthened enforcement. For example, Gansu introduced a 10% \nincrease in fines for overloaded vehicles leading to a major drop in the number of crashes \nattributable to overloading.4 \n \n3.  Project Roads Safety. The Project will ensure that all the necessary safety measures \nare in place. An independent road safety audit of the project roads will be carried out during final \ndesign and construction as well as before the opening of the project expressway. Axle-weighing \nequipment will be installed on project roads to control vehicle overloading in the corridor. GPCD \nwill concentrate on the engineering, road safety audit, blind-spot improvement, and operational \nissues, while the Gansu Provincial Security Bureau will deal with the traffic law enforcement. An \nintegrated  plan  has  been  developed  and  will  be  included  in  the  project  administration \nmemorandum to help the agencies to improve road safety in the region. \n \nB.  Vehicle Emissions \n \n4.  With the growing concern of vehicle emissions in the PRC, the Government is taking a \nseries of measures to control emissions. The Gansu Environmental Protection Bureau (GEPB) \nis  responsible  for  regulating  vehicle  emissions,  in  cooperation  with  the  Gansu  Provincial \nSecurity  Bureau.  Gansu  follows  the  stricter  national  vehicle  emission  control  standards \n(Table A5.1).  By  the  time  the  Project  is  completed,  hydrocarbons,  carbon  monoxide,  and \nnitrogen oxide emissions from vehicles on the project roads are estimated to be at least 20% \nlower than without the Project because of faster and shorter travel. Under the Project, GPCD \nand GEPB will take the following recommended measures to further control vehicle emissions \nand air pollution (Table A5.2). \n                                                 \n1  World Health Organization and Word Bank. 2004.

Overview.  The  road  network  in  Longnan  prefecture  has  a  total  length  of \n11,297 kilometer (km), mostly in poor condition; of this, 8,893 km (or 80%) is unclassified. There \nare no class-I and above roads and class-II roads account for only 3% of the total length. In \nLongnan, 787 villages are not connected with roads. Many villages rely on earth tracks that are \nunsuitable for motorized traffic due to poor riding quality, and which become impassable during \nthe rainy and winter seasons. Bridges are of poor quality and take only light loads. Many smaller \nrivers are crossed by fording. Some sections of county roads are currently impassible because \nof landslides or mudflows. Where they are passable, vehicle operation costs tend to be high. \nAgricultural tractors and motor tricycles are the main form of motorized transport for both goods \nand people. It is estimated that the lack of roads has resulted in 10\u201320% of agricultural produce \nbeing wasted because of inability to transport it to markets and processing centers. \n \n2.  Paving the Unpaved Roads for the Poor. It is important to focus on the improvement \nof a core rural road network that would ensure a minimum connectivity for each township to a \nnearby main road. Gansu Provincial Communications Department agreed to integrate a local \nroad component, comprising seven roads in total 357 km to be upgraded from unclassified to \nclass-III or IV (Table A6). They were selected on the basis of road network efficiency from the \nprovincial  Rural  Road  Development  Plan,  economic  development  potential,  and  poverty \nincidence and population density. The existing roads are in very poor condition, sections are \nunpaved, and traffic on these roads has reached a certain level, so it is more economical to \nupgrade and pave them than maintain the unpaved roads to all weather condition. The total cost \nof the program is CNY233.8 million ($29.2 million), of which Asian Development Bank will \nfinance $15 million of Wudu\u2013Lixian road. The rest will be financed by the Government in \nconjunction of implementation of its Rural Road Development Plan by 2011. \n \n3.  Benefits. The rural roads have been evaluated. The major cost savings will be in the \nform of reduced vehicle operating costs which will ultimately convert to lower agricultural input \ncosts and higher margins for agricultural output. The economic internal rate of return of rural \nroads network was satisfactory with an overall economic internal rate of return of 23% and a net \npresent value of CNY285.6 million. Gansu Provincial Communications Department will start the \nconstruction  of  the  project  rural  roads  concurrently  with  the  project  expressway  and  be \ncompleted by 2011. The Program will directly benefit 763,000 people, about 52% of whom are \npoor beneficiaries, living below the Government low-income of CNY852 per capita per year. \n \nTable A6: Rural Roads Improvement Program \n \nRoad Name  Length  Cost  Towns  Population  Traffic  Improvement \n(km)  (CNY  Served  Served  (AADT) \nmillion  in pcu \n1.

Existing  Situation.  Adequate  and  timely  maintenance  is  important  to  ensure  the \nsustainability of rural roads. With the increasing length of the road network, rapid increase in \ntraffic volumes, and the trend toward using larger trucks with heavier axle loads, there is a \ngrowing concern about the accelerating maintenance requirements in the future. Road sector \nfunding is still insufficient to meet demand of both construction and maintenance, particularly for \nthe  rural  roads  in  the  west  region.  In  Gansu,  local  road  administrative  units  in  county \ngovernments are responsible for rural roads maintenance, and the quality of rural roads is \nperiodically monitored by prefecture and provincial highway administration bureau. Main issues \nassociated with rural road maintenance are: (i) insufficient funding, (ii) inadequate planning, \n(iii) limited implementation capacity, and (iv) lack of market-oriented approach and framework. \nRural road maintenance is generally done by the road administrations, although it starts to \nexperiment with maintenance by contracting out progressively.  \n \n2.  Overall  Road  Maintenance  Expenditure.  In  Gansu,  the  need  for  maintenance  is \nincreasingly recognized by various levels of the government. In terms of sustainability of overall \nroad maintenance with the resource allocated, about 81\u201385% of the road maintenance fee was \nspent  for  road  maintenance  during  2001\u20132005,  which  met  the  standards  in  Box  A7.  The \nmaintenance  expenditures  exceeded  the  growth  rate  of  the  road  network  and  the  road \nmaintenance fee revenue, which means a net increase in the average maintenance expenditure \nper kilometer. In Gansu, roads with heavy traffic are receiving priorities for maintenance.  \n \nTable A7.1: Existing Road Network and Road Maintenance Financing in Gansu \n \nIndicator  2001  2002  2003  2004  2005 \n           \n1.

Rural Road Maintenance. The road maintenance fee is the main dedicated channel to \ncore road network maintenance. Although maintenance is generally adequate for highways, \nthere is an overall shortage of maintenance funds in Gansu, particularly for the lower class \nroads (class-IV and below). It is important to (i) get a strong commitment from provincial and \nlocal  governments,  (ii)  ensure  the  timely  and  adequate  fund  allocation  for  rural  road \nmaintenance,  and  (iii)  utilize  the  limited  funds  more  effectively  by  adopting  competitive \napproaches to reduce the whole life-cycle cost of rural road maintenance. The Project will \n(i) strengthen local road authorities\u2019 capacity by developing rural road maintenance manual and \nproviding on-the-job training, and (ii) encourage contracting out rural road maintenance to small-\nscale or community contractors through clear and transparent procurement procedures and a \ngood monitoring system. Standard bidding documents will be developed under the Project. \n \n4.  Policy Framework. In 2005, the People\u2019s Republic of China State Council launched the \nPolicy  Reform  for  Rural  Road  Maintenance.  Under  the  new  policy,  construction  and \nmaintenance of rural roads will be of equal importance.

Monitoring will focus on a few representative communities in the project area, a useful \nexercise in accumulating knowledge on how benefits flow to local people. Because this pilot \n ", "42  Appendix 11 \n \napproach will greatly narrow down the scope of monitoring, local authorities are expected to \nundertake adequate monitoring more readily. During project preparation, three villages in three \ntownships in Longnan prefecture were selected as the pilot sites: Dujialing (Anhua township), \nLoufang (Loutang township), and Jiudan (Pingya township). \n \nC.  Implementation of Monitoring \n \n4.  The  Gansu  Provincial  Communications  Department  (GPCD)  concurred  with  the \nmonitoring framework and the set of indicators for monitoring the project\u2019s performance. During \nproject preparation, the baseline values for the indicators were specified to the extent available \n(Table A11.2) and will be further updated by GPCD, where necessary. GPCD will measure the \nindicators for project evaluation prior to and during project implementation at completion, and \nannually 3 years after project completion.

Overview \n \n1.  The project expressway, Wudu\u2013Guanzihou (WuGuan), is an important section of the \nLanzhou\u2013Haikou  artery,  one  of  the  nine  north-south  corridors  of  the  National  Expressway \nNetwork in the People\u2019s Republic of China. The planned transport corridor starts from Lanzhou, \nruns through Lintao, Minxian, Wudu, and Guanzigou in Gansu province, then reaches Sichuan \nprovince to connect Chengdu and Chongqing, and ends at Haikou in Hainan province. This will \nform the shortest route between Lanzhou (capital of Gansu) and Chengdu (capital of Sichuan) \nand Chongqing municipalities in the western People\u2019s Republic of China. \n \n2.  In Gansu, the Lanzhou\u2013Lintao section is already open to traffic. The remaining sections \nfrom Lintao\u2013Guanzigou will be constructed in three phases: Lintao\u2013Minxian (156 kilometer [km]), \nMinxian\u2013Wudu  (159  km)  and  WuGuan  (134  km).  Considering  the  existing  and  future \nconnectivity of road network, the WuGuan section is given the priority to construct to meet the \nneeds of the corridor in most economical way. Road conditions between Wudu to Tianshui (via \nPH206 and NH316) and Tianshui to Lanzhou (NH45) are in general good condition (Map 2). In \nSichuan, WuGuan section will connect to the planned expressway of Guanzigou to Guangyuan \n(56 km, target completion: 2012). The other expressways from Guangyuan further south in \nSichuan are either under construction or already completed (Map 1). The main section of \nChongqing  to  Beihai  (seaport  in  Guangxi)  will  be  completed  by  2010.  Therefore,  upon \ncompletion of the expressway, local people along the expressway will be connected to all main \ncities of Lanzhou, Xi\u2019an, Chongqing and Chengdu by class-II and above highways. \n \n3.  The project expressway will be built in parallel to existing national highway (NH212) and \nprovincial highway (PH206). NH212, built in 1958 with a combination of classes-II\u2013III and below \nstandards, is in very poor condition. The length of NH212 from Wudu to Guanzigou is 270 km. \nAll traffic takes a more roundabout route through the mountains, which increases the distance \nand slows down the average speed driven. The existing PH206, built in 1957, is below even \nclass-IV standard, with steep slopes and sharp turns, resulting in a high safety risks. In addition, \nan unreliable ferry crossing over Bailong River is not always passable. NH212 and PH206 have \nbecome transport bottlenecks between project area and Sichuan province, impeding exchanges \nof people and goods. The proposed expressway with the total length of 134 km, will reduce the \ntrip length from Wudu to Guanzigou by 136 km, and resulting of time savings of at least 5 to \n7 hours. \n \nB.  Traffic Forecast \n \n4.  Future traffic on WuGuan was based on routine traffic counts and the comprehensive \norigin  and  destination  (O&D)  surveys  that  were  made  in  May  and  June  2005  at  eight \nobservation stations under the feasibility study. These survey stations were located on NH212, \nPR206 and other roads in the project area. The traffic demand was projected separately for \nfreight and passenger on the basis of expected increases in population, gross domestic product \n(GDP) and vehicle ownership. GDP growth rates were projected to be 9%, 8%, and 7% for the \nperiods  of  2005\u20132012,  2012\u20132022,  and  2022\u20132032,  respectively.  The  average  demand \nelasticity was 1.1 for passengers and 0.9 for freight. \n \n5.  The traffic forecasts allow for potential generated and diverted traffic as a result of (i) the \nadditional traffic generated by the Project through the lower cost of expressway travel; (ii) traffic \ndiverted from the existing rail network from Lanzhou\u2013Baoji\u2013Chengdu because it is already run \nover its capacity; and (iii) potential divert traffic from other road corridors. The traffic projection \nalso takes account of non-modeled local intra zone traffic on the road network. \n ", "  Appendix 12  45 \n \n6.  Assignment of traffic was made between every pair of traffic zones. The choice of route \nwithin the network was based on their perceptions of generalized travel costs, a function of \ntravel time, distance and associated toll cost, affected by road conditions and traffic congestion. \nWithout the Project, the existing roads will be very congested in 2012, resulting in expensive \ntravel. With the Project, there will be significant improvement in terms of the performance and \nefficiency of the corridor. It will attract significant vehicle trips, especially of through traffic from \nother road corridors, which will reduce the number of accidents, vehicle operating costs, and \ntravel time on these roads and thereby directly benefit the project area. \n \n7.  The diverted traffic from existing roads has been calculated using Asian Development \nBank Toll Diversion Model. Depending on the trip length, 35% to 96% of traffic will divert to the \nproject expressway. The higher diversion is for trips of over 200 km. Generated traffic, arising \nfrom the lower cost of expressway travel, will be related to the decrease in cost by price \nelasticity. Generated traffic was computed to be 12% for passenger and 9% for freight. Diverted \ntraffic from the railway and other road corridors was assumed at 8% for passenger and 5% for \nfreight. \n \n8.  The resulting traffic projection is given in Table A12 for the project expressway. The \nforecast traffic volume on the expressway is expected to grow from average of 5,500 passenger \ncar units (pcu) in 2012 to an average of 11,200 pcu in 2022, a 7.4% average annual growth \nrate. It will then grow more slowly at 7.2% per annum thereafter to reach an average of \n22,500 passenger car units in 2032.  \n \nTable A12: Average Annual Daily Traffic of Project Expressway \n(passenger car units) \n \n      Growth    Growth \nRoad Section  2012  2022  Rate (%)  2032  Rate (%) \n8,257  15,699  6.6  29,978  6.7 \nShawan\u2013Liangshui \nLiangshui\u2013Wudu  14,390  28,547  7.1  54,227  6.6 \nWudu\u2013Hanwang  8,575  17,610  7.5  36,564  7.6 \nHanwang\u2013Da\u00e1nmiao  6,246  12,383  7.1  26,889  8.1 \nDa\u00e1nmiao\u2013Pipa  5,313  10,751  7.3  21,547  7.2 \nPipa\u2013Luotang  3,833  8,003  7.6  16,544  7.5 \nLuotang\u2013Yujiawan  3,698  7,720  7.6  16,006  7.6 \nYujiawan\u2013Guanzigou  4,844  9,970  7.5  21,671  8.1 \nWeighted Average  5,500  11,200  7.4  22,500  7.2 \nSources: Asian Development Bank and technical assistance consultants estimates. \n \n ", "46  Appendix 13 \nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n \n1.  General. The Project comprises a 134-kilometer (km), access-controlled expressway \nbetween Wudu and Guanzigou, upgrading of seven rural roads of total 357 km that connect to \nthe  expressway  through  the  road  network  system,  and  200  township  bus  stations.  The \neconomic analysis incorporates a 5-year implementation period and a 20-year operating period. \nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the Project was estimated by comparing the \nsituation with and without the Project. Without the Project, traffic will continue to use the existing \nroad network, national highway (NH212) and provincial highway (PH206, which will be more \ncongested and expensive to maintain due to rapidly increasing volume of traffic. Some travel \nmay not take place because of the congestion and the resulting increasing travel time and \nvehicle operating costs (VOCs). With the Project, traffic will benefit from faster, cheaper, and \nsafer travel due to the rapidly reducing of congestion. Some additional trips will be generated as \nthe economy responds to lower transport costs and better services. There will also be some \ndiversion of traffic from existing rail services in the corridor, mainly for fresh and consumer \ngoods. \n \n2.  Expressway  Component. Economic evaluation was undertaken using 2006 prices, \nwhich expressed in CNY using the domestic price numeraire with a shadow exchange rate \nfactor of 1.013 for foreign exchange effects. A shadow price was used to put an economic value \non the wages paid to unskilled labor, but not on the wage paid to skilled labor, because no \nskilled worker surplus exists. A shadow wage rate factor of 0.67 was used to convert the \nfinancial  wage  rate  to  an  economic  opportunity  cost  of  labor.  The  economic  costs  of  the \nexpressway include (i) the capital cost, including physical contingence, land acquisition and \nresettlement,  and  environmental  mitigation  costs;  and  (ii)  the  costs  of  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M) the expressway, including the costs of replacing depreciated equipment. \nThe land acquisition and resettlement costs were based on their opportunity costs, that is, the \nagricultural output forgone and the re-siting of displaced activities. \n \n3.  The economic benefits include (i) savings in VOCs resulting from the reduced travel \ndistance and improved road conditions; (ii) savings in the value of passenger time and freight \ntied up in transit; (iii) savings resulting from fewer accidents; (iv) benefits to generated traffic; \nand (v) savings in capital and O&M costs for NH212. \n \n4.  The project expressway will shorten the route by 136 km. The calculations of VOC \nsavings allow for differences in roughness, terrain, speed, and congestion, and also allow for a \nchanging vehicle mix for both passenger and freight vehicles and improvements in the vehicle \nperformance. Travel time savings are valued for passengers in vehicles only as the time of crew \nmembers  is  valued  in the  VOCs.  The  values  used  per person  hour  are  CNY6.93  for  car \npassengers and CNY1.04 for bus passengers. The economic costs of accidents are estimated \nin terms of direct property damage and forgone income on the basis of national data for 2005. \nThe  average  direct  cost  of  an  accident  is  estimated  at  CNY35,800  on  expressways, \nCNY34,800 on class-II roads, CNY32,800 on class-III roads, and CNY28,500 on class-IV roads. \nThe benefits to generated traffic are estimated at half the VOC and time savings of normal traffic \nas a proxy for willingness to pay. In addition, savings in capital and O&M costs for NH212 and \nPH206 are calculated on the basis of maintaining a volume-to-capacity ratio of 1.0 without the \nProject. The EIRR for the expressway component was estimated at 17.5%, indicating that the \nProject is economically viable, with a net present value of CNY5,161.5 billion. \n \n5.  Rural Road Component. The rural roads for upgrading under the Project were chosen \nbased on the effect on overall road network efficiency and cost-benefit analysis, economic \n ", "  Appendix 13  47 \ndevelopment potential and population density. The rural road costs include capital cost and \nO&M costs. The principal benefits of the rural road improvement were identified as (i) VOC \nsavings, (ii) benefits to generated traffic, and (iii) savings in O&M costs. The seven rural roads \nhave a combined EIRR of 23% per annum with a net present value of CNY285.6 million. \n \n6.  Rural  Transport  Service  Component. Economic benefits of rural transport service \ninclude: (i) time savings, (ii) economic output from the economic and social activities that would \nbe foregone due to the loss of passenger travels resulting from unpredictable bus schedules \nand/or poor weather conditions, (iii) economic output of the generated traffic resulting from \nimproved passenger transport services, and (iv) traffic accident cost savings. In addition, the \nimproved transport services are expected to generate substantial social values in the form of \nbroadened socioeconomic opportunities for the rural people. Without the Project, lack of efficient \ntransport services causes produce spoilage, delay of freight delivery, labor unemployed, road \naccident, and lower school attendance. The results from pilot projects undertaken in Gansu \nsince 2003 provide strong empirical evidence to support the social and economic justifications \nfor the provision of township bus stations to the rural poor (Appendix 4). \n \n7.  The Whole Project. The Project as a whole generates an estimated EIRR of 17.9% \n(Table A13.1). The VOC savings from the expressway are the major economic benefit (75%) \nfollowed by passenger time savings (13%). Avoided accident costs, savings to generated traffic, \nand other benefits are all relatively small. The benefits of the rural roads, while important to the \nvillages concerned, account for 3.8% of the total benefits. \n \n8.  The  results  of  sensitivity  analysis confirm  the  robustness  of  the  project\u2019s economic \nviability: changes in the key variables\u2014construction costs, 1-year delay in completion, and \nbenefits do not significantly affect the economic viability (Table A13.2). The capital cost would \nhave to be 68% higher than estimated for the EIRR to fall to the cutoff rate of 12%. Considering \nthe experience of Asian Development Bank in the People\u2019s Republic of China, such an increase \nin capital cost is unlikely. Asian Development Bank-financed road projects in the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China have not encountered major cost overruns. \n \n9.  A risk analysis was carried out to determine the degree of uncertainty on the Project. \nEach uncertainty factor (such as capital cost, traffic growth, gross domestic product growth, etc.) \nwas varied at random within defined limits. The results of the risk analysis showed with these \nuncertainties, that the (i) expected EIRR, based on the weighted average of all simulated \ncombination  is  15.2%  about  2.7%  lower  than  the  base  case  EIRR  of  17.9%  (without \nconsideration of risks); (ii) EIRR associated with assumed probabilities range from a minimum of \n11.9% to a maximum of 17.7%; and (iii) the probability of the EIRR to be below 12% is 6.1%. \n \n10.  The economic analysis of the Project was extended to analyze distribution of project net \nbenefits by determining the project effects for various beneficiaries, including road users, labor, \nand local economy. It was found that road users will receive the largest share of net benefit, \naccounting for 93% (65% for passenger traffic and 28% for freight traffic) of the total net \nbenefits. \n \n ", " \nTable A13.1: Economic Internal Rate of Return  4\n8\n(constant 2006 economic prices, domestic numeraire, CNY million)   \nYear  Without  With Project Costs  Total  VOC                 \nProject  Cost  Cost  Time  Accident  Generate  Freight  Rail  Rural  Total  Net   \nCapital  O&M  Rural  Bus  A\nCost  Savings  Savings  Savings  Traffic  Savings  Diversion  Roads  Benefits  Benefits  p\nRoads  Stations  p\ne\n2007    932.2     93.5   32.0  1,057.7                  (1,057.7)  n\nd\n2008    2,627.6     70.1   24.0  2,721.8                  (2,721.8)  ix\n 1\n2009    2,202.5     46.8   16.0  2,265.3                  (2,265.3)  3\n \n2010    2,054.6     11.7   4.0  2,070.3                  (2,070.3) \n2011    2,005.4     11.7   4.0  2,021.1                  (2,021.1) \n2012  38.5    43.2  1.8   5.0  11.5  1,075.6  178.4  35.2   30.0  4.6  68.4  82.1  1,474.3  1,462.8  \n2012  38.5    43.2  1.8   5.0  11.5  1,075.6  178.4  35.2   30.0  4.6  68.4  82.1  1,474.3  1,462.8  \n2013  40.4    44.2  1.9   5.2  10.8  1,193.1  200.3  38.0   32.9  5.4  72.9  86.1  1,628.7  1,617.9  \n2014  42.5    45.2  1.9   5.3  10.0  1,323.4  224.8  41.0   36.1  6.3  77.6  90.4  1,799.6  1,789.6  \n2015  44.6    46.3  2.0   5.5  9.1  1,467.8  252.3  44.3   39.6  7.4  82.6  94.8  1,988.8  1,979.7  \n2016  46.9    47.4  2.0   5.6  8.2  1,628.0  283.1  47.8   43.4  8.6  88.0  99.4  2,198.3  2,190.2  \n2017  49.3    48.5  2.1   5.8  7.1  1,805.5  317.6  51.6   47.6  10.0  93.7  104.3  2,430.4  2,423.2  \n2018  51.8    49.7  2.2   6.0  6.0  2,002.4  356.1  55.7   52.3  11.7  99.8  109.4  2,687.4  2,681.4  \n2019  54.4    50.9  2.2   6.1  4.8   2,220.6  399.3  60.1   57.3  13.7  106.3  114.8  2,972.1  2,967.3  \n2020  57.2    52.1  2.3   6.3  3.6  2,462.5  447.5  64.9   62.9  16.0  113.2  120.4  3,287.5  3,283.9  \n2021  58.0    53.4  2.4   6.5  4.2  2,730.8  501.5  70.0   69.0  18.6  118.3  126.4  3,634.6  3,630.3  \n2022  58.9  182.6   54.7  2.4   6.7  187.5  2,960.2  542.5  74.9   73.6  20.9  126.5  133.7  3,932.4  3,744.9  \n2023  59.9    56.0  2.5   6.9  5.6  3,208.8  586.7  80.1   78.5  23.5  135.4  140.5  4,253.5  4,247.9  \n2024  60.9    57.4  2.6   7.1  6.3  3,478.4  634.2  85.7   83.7  26.4  144.9  147.6  4,600.8   4,594.5  \n2025  61.9    58.9  2.7   7.3  7.0  3,770.5  685.3  91.6   89.3  29.6  155.0  155.0  4,976.3  4,969.3  \n2026  63.0    60.4  2.7   7.6  7.7  4,087.2  740.1  98.0   95.2  33.2  165.9  162.9  5,382.4  5,374.7  \n2027  64.2    61.9  2.8   7.8  8.3   4,430.4  798.9  104.7   101.6  37.2  177.5  171.1  5,821.5   5,813.1  \n2028  65.4    63.5  2.9   8.0  9.0  4,802.5  862.1  112.0   108.3  41.7  189.9  179.7  6,296.2  6,287.2  \n2029  66.6    65.1  3.0   8.3  9.7  5,205.7  929.7  119.8   115.6  46.7  203.2  188.8  6,809.4  6,799.7  \n2030  68.0    66.8  3.1   8.5  0.4  5,642.8  1,002.1  128.1   123.3  52.3  217.4  198.3  7,364.2  7,353.8  \n2031  69.4  (6,069.12)  68.5  3.2   8.8  (6,058.0)  6,116.5  1,079.5  137.0   131.5  58.6  233.2  211.0  7,967.1  14,025.1  \n                      Economic Net Present Value  5,655.9 \n                      Economic Internal Rate of Return   17.9% \n( ) = negative, O&M = operation and maintenance, VOC = vehicle operating cost. \nSource: Asian Development Bank and technical assistance consultants estimates. \n \nTable A13.2: Sensitivity Analysis \nScenario  EIRR (%)  NPV (CNY million)  Switching Valuea (%) \n1.

General \n \n1.  The  projected  financial  statements  of  the  proposed  Project  have  been  prepared  in \ncurrent terms for the period 2007\u20132031. Construction will be completed in 2011, and the first full \nyear of operation will be 2012. The assumed foreign and local inflation rates are assumed at \n1.9% and 3% during the projection period. The initial foreign exchange rate used for 2006 is \nCNY8.02 to $1. The cost estimates are presented in current terms taking into account the \npotential impacts of domestic and international inflation.  \n \nB.  Financial Projections \n \n2.  Operating revenues from tolls are projected based on forecast of future traffic and a \nbase toll rate of CNY0.35 per passenger car per kilometer (km). Corresponding tolls for other \nvehicle types are CNY0.55 for a small bus or a light truck; CNY0.80 for a medium-sized bus or \ntruck; CNY1.25 for a large bus or truck; CNY1.60 for a light articulated truck; and CNY2.00 for a \ntrailer.1 In addition to expressway tolls, Gansu Provincial Communications Department (GPCD) \nproposes to impose tunnel toll rate of CNY3.0 per passenger car per km for tunnels over 1 km in \nlength.2 The toll rates are assumed to increase in current terms to keep up with inflation. There \nwould be no real increase of project tolls over project life span. The main purpose of the toll \ncollection is to repay loans, not to maximize the financial rate of return on the entire investment. \nOther income (from fuel sales, rental income, etc.) amounts to 2% of toll revenue.  \n \n3.  Annual incremental operation and maintenance (O&M) costs are calculated based on \n2006 prices as follows: (i) toll operation cost totaled an estimated CNY11.05 million in 2012 \n(300 staff members with annual wages of CNY30,000 per person, and other administration \nexpenses). Labor costs will rise at a growth rate of 4% in real terms, and staff number will \nincrease  with  traffic  flows  using  an  elasticity  of  0.05;  (ii)  routine  maintenance  costs  are \nestimated at CNY80,000 per km per annum; and it will increase in line with traffic flows using an \nelasticity of 0.3; (iii) tunnel O&M costs account for about 50% of total O&M expenses in the \nopening year. Assumptions include: electricity costs at CNY0.50 per kilowatt hour; labor costs at \nCNY15,000  per  annum;  and  regular  maintenance  costs  at  CNY300,000  per  km;  and \n(iv) environmental monitoring costs at CNY800,000 per annum. All incremental O&M costs are \nprojected  to  increase  annually  in  line  with  domestic  inflation  rates.  In  addition,  periodic \nmaintenance cost would be required after 10 years of operation at a cost of CNY1.2 million per \nkm in 2006 prices. \n \n4.  The Project will be funded at 39% by equity or grants, 61% by long-term loans. The \nBank of Communications (BOC) loan will be repayable over 25 years, including a 5-year grace \nperiod. For the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) loan, it is assumed as 25-year maturity, \nincluding a 5-year grace period, US dollar London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based loan. In \naddition, there is 0.75% commitment fee. \n \n5.  Applicable business taxes at a rate of 5.5% are charged on revenue. Corporate income \ntax at 15% is paid on income after deducting business taxes,3 depreciation and interest charges, \noperating expenses, and any prior year losses carried forward. \n                                                 \n1  Under the current Gansu provincial \u201cgreen passage\u201d regulations, to reduce the burden for the poor, local vehicles \ncarrying fresh agricultural produce or livestock are exempted from tolls. Poor communities will benefit from the \nexemption. It is assumed that 10% of such vehicles are exempted from tolls.  \n2  It is consistent with current practice in the west region and in accordance with the Toll Road Management \nRegulation announced by the State Council in September 2004. \n3  Concessionary rate applied for qualifying western region companies (including expressway companies). \n ", "50  Appendix 14 \n6.  Projected financial statements are presented in Table A14.1. Despite the low profitability, \nthe forecast revenue under the base assumptions are sufficient to cover annual recurrent costs, \ndepreciation, debt repayments on the ADB and BOC loans from the expressway operation from \nthe six year of operation.  \n \nC.  Financial Analysis \n \n7.  The major assumptions used for calculation of financial internal rate of return (FIRR) are: \n(i) all calculations are made in 2006 prices, covering a period from 2007 to 2031; (ii) capital cost \ninclude all incremental capital expenditures related to the construction and equipment for the \nexpressway, but exclude price contingencies and interest during construction; (iii) O&M costs \ninclude all annual incremental expenses incurred in operating the expressway, but exclude \ndepreciation and debt repayment provisions; (iv) operating revenues from toll used in financial \nprojections are also adjusted to 2006 prices; and (v) the residual value equal to undepreciated \nvalue of capital investment is included as a benefit of the FIRR calculation. \n \n8.  The estimated weighted average cost of capital (WACC), after-tax, in real terms was \ncalculated using estimated capital mix and costs of funds. Costs have been considered as \nfollows: (i) the applicable 10 year fixed swap rate plus a provision for ADB\u2019s spread of 0.6% is \nused for ADB debt, (ii) the estimated interest costs of 6.39% per annum is used for the domestic \nloan funds, and (iii) the cost of equity was assumed to be 8%. The cost of debt is also adjusted \nto reflect the impact of income tax of 15%. The nominal cost of debt is converted to the real cost \nof debt by applying domestic and international average inflation rate for domestic and foreign \ncurrency denominated debt, respectively. \n \n9.  The FIRR for the Project, computed on an after-tax basis, is 4.6%. This compares \nfavorably with the WACC, also computed at after-tax basis, of 3.4% (Table A14.2). The Project \nis considered both financially viable and sustainable. The sensitivity of the project's financial \nindicators to cost and revenue variations is shown in Table A14.3. \n \nC.  Financial Evaluation of Gansu Provincial Communications Department  \n \n10.  The  actual  revenue  and  expenditures  of  GPCD  during  the  Tenth  Five-Year  Plan \n(10th FYP, 2001\u20132005) and projected Eleventh Five Year Plan (11th FYP 2006\u20132010) are given \nin Table A14.4. Over the 10th FYP, the expenditures were financed by vehicle purchase tax, \nMinistry of Communication\u2019s subsidy and provincial budget (50%), road maintenance fee (8%), \ntoll revenues (6%), transport service surcharges (12%), and bank loan (24%). New construction \naccounted about 70% of total revenue while maintenance expenditure accounted about 9% of \ntotal revenue.  \n \n11.  Based on the budget forecasts, the financing of the Project will require about 8% of the \nprojected  annual  total  GPCD  revenue  during  the  11th  FYP.  This  ratio  indicates  the  total \ninvestment cost of the Project constitutes only a small fraction of GPCD\u2019s road expenses. \nDuring the 11th FYP, the funds\u2019 allocation is expected to improve with the new construction \nbudget projected to remain at the same level (70%) while the maintenance will increase to about \n11% of the total revenue. GPCD has the capacity to mobilize sufficient counterpart funds for the \nconstruction  and  ensure  overall  sustainability  of  the  project  rural  roads  and  township  bus \nstations.  \n ", "     \nTable A14.1 Projected Financial Statements   \n(CNY million) \n \nItem  2007  2008  2009  2010  2011  2012  2013  2014  2015  2016  2017  2018  2019 \n                         \nA.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nIs the sector identified as a national   Yes  Is the sector identified as a national   Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?     priority in country poverty partnership   \n   No  agreement?    No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the People\u2019s Republic of China:  \n \nContributions will be through improved linkage to market and improved access to external jobs and social services for \nthe poor; lower transport costs of agricultural inputs and products; better access to and interaction with other regions, \nand jobs during construction and after completion owing to increased economic activities. Specifically, the project\u2019s \nlocal road component of 357 kilometer (km) and 200 township bus stations will help local people to break the transport \nbottleneck and, therefore, add economic values to their fruits, vegetables and animals that have been introduced by \nvarious poverty reduction and agricultural development programs. Expressway (especially interchange areas), local \nroads and township bus stations will speed up the development of mineral and tourism resources, and facilitate the \nformation of new local growth centers that will have greater impact on poverty reduction. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis         Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nSocioeconomic Profile. With a per capita GDP of CNY6,135 (45% of the national average), Gansu ranked 30th \namong the 31 administrative areas. Annual per capita rural income in Gansu was CNY1,980, or 39% lower than the \nnational average of CNY3,255. Annual per capita rural income was CNY1,252 in Longnan, CNY1,326 in Tianshui and \nCNY1,590 in Dingxi, or 60%, 59% and 51% lower than the national average of CNY3,255. The incidence of rural \npoverty in Longnan, Tianshui and Dingxi are 42%, 29% and 38%, respectively, which indicates that project area is still \nan economically underdeveloped area in the PRC. The Project will benefit 2.7 million people in Longnan (focal \nprefecture of the Project). In addition, 50 township bus stations in Dingxi and 50 township bus stations in Tianshui \nprefectures will benefit additional nearly 2 million people (0.99 million in Tianshui and 0.95 million in Dingxi). In total, \nthe Project will benefit 4.6 million people, of whom 37% are poor.  \n \nSocial Benefits. It is estimated that total 56,000 person-years of unskilled jobs will be created during the project \nconstruction and each worker is estimated to earn CNY6,000 per year assuming one worker works 300 days/year and \nearn CNY20/day, which is 4.6 times higher than average annual income per capita in the Project impact areas \n(CNY1,300). Overy 60% of the jobs will be filled up by the poor with an estimated total of CNY200 million in wage \npayment annually during construction. Using local materials for the project construction will contribute CNY200 million. \nThe Project will also create 1,700 full time jobs in which CNY15 million of wage payments will be received annually by \nthe poor during operation. In addition, the estimated tax revenue from the expressway construction to the local \ngovernments is CNY248 million. This additional revenue will be used for poverty reduction and social activities, with \nspecial attention to resettlement affected groups, women, and other vulnerable people in the region.  \n \nImproved Rural Road Conditions at Township Level. In Longnan, there are total 11,297 km of roads, of which \n8,893 km (79%) are unclassified, The Project will improve 357 km rural roads from unclassified standard to classes-\nIII\u2013IV standard, of which 99 km in Wudu district, 28 km in Wengxian county, 33 km in Kangxian county, 72 km in \nChengxian county, and 125 km in Lixian county. It is estimated that 763,000 people of poor will benefit from it. \n \nImproved Access to Other Off-farm Opportunities. The project road area is rich in minerals (lead, zinc, and \nvanadium), agricultural products, forestry, livestock, hydropower generation, and tourism resources. Longnan and \nTianshui are hot tourists areas, had attracted over 2 millions tourists in 2005. The number of registered small business \nin Longnan is 27,232 (51% in rural area) in 2004 and it is expected to increase by 20% at project completion.  \n \nImproved Rural Transport Services. Currently, there are 13 inter-provincial bus routes and 85 inter-county bus \nroutes in Longnan. Most of rural people travel to the township center for marketing, shopping, schooling and accessing \nto the hospital. It is expected to increase by 1.5 times more bus routes for inter-provincial and 2 times more bus routes \nfor inter-county after the project completion. At present, the travel times from Wudu are 10 hours to Lanzhou, 12 hours \nto Xi\u2019an or Chengdu, and 16 hours to Chongqing. It is expected to be half of travel times upon project completion. \n \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?   Yes       No \n \nRural and urban population, bus passengers (long distance and inter- and intra-county), transport operators (freight, \nbus, and drivers), enterprises (industry, tourism, and traders), and local government are identified as the project \nstakeholders. Positive and negative effects to these groups caused by the Project were analyzed by the social survey. \nOver 5,000 people from different stakeholders were consulted during the project preparatory stage. \n \n ", "  Appendix 15  55 \nIs there a participation strategy?   Yes    No \n \nBefore the alignment was finalized, local government and communities were consulted to minimize losses of high \nquality arable land. The local people will have an opportunity to participate in the Project. It is estimated that the total \n62 million  unskilled  worker-days  is  required  under  the  Project\u201461,568,982  worker  days  for  the  expressway \nconstruction based on the feasibility study estimates and another 1,700 full-time jobs during operation.  \n \nD.  Gender Development  \n \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women:  \n \nAll participants interviewed during social surveys know the HIV/AIDS and 70% of them know some of the preventative \nmeasures. The Project will facilitate women to make more trips and save their travel time. Gansu already has a high \nrate of women involved in road construction and maintenance activities since they prefer local work to going outside. \nThe Project owner will encourage contractors to provide equal opportunities for women. For example, about 60% of \nwomen will be engaged for the landscaping work.  \n \nHas an output been prepared?   Yes   No \n \nEmployment quota of women under the project construction is agreed with the Executing Agency and included in \nrelevant sections of the RRP, the Social Development Action Plan, and loan covenant.  \n \nE.

The focal prefecture of the Project (Longnan) is geographically isolated (surrounded by \nhigh mountain range and counties located in narrow valleys), and there are no rail line or other \nnon-road transport modes. The economy is mainly supported by agriculture, labor migration, \nmineral  extraction,  and  hydropower  generation.  Presently,  it  takes  10\u201316  hours  to  reach \nLanzhou,  Xi\u2019an,  Chengdu  and  Chongqing  due  to  poor  roads  condition.1 At  present,  It  is \nextremely difficult to trade with larger markets at a competitive price (transportation cost and \ndelivery time are high). The transport bottleneck has been a major barrier for both large and \nsmall businesses development. \n \n2.  The  Project  will  provide  better  link  to  regional  central  markets  (Lanzhou,  Xi\u2019an, \nChongqing and Chengdu), which creates opportunities for local people to expand and start local \nproduce export-oriented processing and trading. It is expected that the local produce export-\noriented processing and trading business will also increase by 20% in about 5 years after \nconstruction completion. The Project will result in a booming development of tourism industry.2 \nIn response to this booming growth, there will be high demand for provision of services of \nvarious types, including catering, handcraft production and trade, and local transport, etc. All \ntogether, the Project will result in an overall 25% growth of small business in the project area by \n2015. Such a growth will benefit about 50,000 labors and their families. \n \n3.  The project area has potential for the small business to grow rapidly. Proposed initiatives \nto  further  develop  small  business  and  commercial  activities  are  given  in  Box  A17.  These \ninitiatives will be implemented by local government, in cooperation with local road authorities.  \n \nBox A17: Proposed Initiatives to Develop Small Business in the Region \n \n\u2022  Improve road conditions from village to townships (direct project component). \n\u2022  Establish permanent markets at township level near the township bus stations (direct project \ncomponent). \n\u2022  Establish small business incubator at expressway service areas and interchanges along rural \nroads and next to township bus stations.  \n\u2022  Promote local tourist spots and restaurants along the expressways and local roads by \nadvertising on road maps, billboards, and signs to attract more visitors. \n\u2022  Ease the restriction and barriers for farmers to access the micro-credit. \n\u2022  Provide legal advice, trainings, access to capital, and business licenses to form the farmer\u2019s \ncooperatives.  \n\u2022  Enhance credit services with technical trainings.  \n\u2022  Involve local educational institution for community economic development.

Also, Wenxian County is directly connected with the Jiuzhaigou National Nature \nReserve Park in Sichuan Province.  \n ", "  Appendix 18  59 \nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT PLAN \n \n1.  One  resettlement  plan  addresses  impacts  caused  by  the  expressway  component, \nincluding  connector  roads,  based  on  the  project  feasibility  study.  Another  resettlement  plan \naddresses the relatively small impacts caused by the rural road upgrading program and the \nconstruction of 200 township bus stations. Prior to commencement of land acquisition, Gansu \nProvincial Communications Department (GPCD) will update both resettlement plans based on \ndetailed measurement survey and submit them to Asian Development Bank (ADB) for approval. \nDuring project construction, if there is significant material change in project scope or other causes, \nthe resettlement plans will be revised, disclosed to affected persons (APs) and submitted to ADB \nfor approval prior to commencement of such changes. \n2.  The proposed expressway will permanently require 681 hectares (ha) of land of which \n12% is non-irrigated farmland, 30% is irrigated farmland, 12% is orchard, 6% is housing plots, and \n40% is floodplain, shrub forest, grassland and wasteland. Another 33 ha of land is estimated to be \noccupied temporarily during the construction phase. Based on the Chinese standard for impact \nassessment, the equivalent of 2,834 persons would lose all their land and agricultural livelihoods. \nSince the expressway will actually cross many parcels of scattered farmland, it is estimated that \nthe average loss of land per household would be 33%, which means the number of partially \naffected people would be in the order of 8,500 persons (or about 2,070 households). Along with \nland acquisition, 15,130 square meters of houses will be demolished, necessitating relocation of \n151 rural households (621 persons), which is an average of 2 houses per village.  \n3.  For the upgrading of seven rural roads, it is estimated that about 100 households with \n400 persons would be relocated and another 500 persons would be partially affected by land \nacquisition. The 200 township transport centers do not require land acquisition; instead they \nobtain land use rights for existing state-owned construction land in each town. Each center will \nrequire 1,000\u20131,500 m2 of land, for a total of 26.6 ha; these sites have been selected and \nagreements have been signed between the Gansu Transport Administration Bureau and each \ntownship government. \n4.  For people unavoidably affected, the resettlement objective is to achieve equal or better \nincome and living standards in line with the People\u2019s Republic of China Land Administration Law \n(1998), State Council Document No. 28, and the ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement. The \nGPCD will ensure that any people losing land, housing, other assets or income sources will be \nassisted to fully restore their income and living standards. In July 2005, the Gansu provincial \ngovernment  issued  Decree  No.  48  which  stipulates  the  regulations  for  land  compensation, \nresettlement subsidies, young crop compensation, and other measures to carry out resettlement. \nAccording  to  the  policy  and  basic  socioeconomic  conditions  among  project  counties,  land \ncompensation standards have been established based on 16 times the average annual output \nvalue (AAOV). However, the AAOV are going to be updated based on detailed survey, so the \nactual compensation rates are not yet finalized. The estimated compensation rates in Wudu \nDistrict and Wenxian County are estimated to range from CNY13,000 to 22,300 per mu for \nirrigated farmland; CNY8,300 to 15,500 per mu for dryland, cash forest, floodplain and house \nplots, CNY17,600 to 32,700 per mu for vegetable land, CNY5,000 to 9,300 per mu for shrub \nforest, CNY4,200 to 7,700 per mu for grassland and CNY1,000 for wasteland. If basic farmland is \nacquired, compensation will be calculated on the basis of 30 times AAOV. The land compensation \nrates  for  the  rural  roads  will  follow  the  same  compensation  principles.  Green  crops  will  be \ncompensated  based  on  0.5  times  AAOV.  Those  people  losing  land  temporarily  during \nconstruction will receive a payment equivalent to production value foregone for the period of loss, \nwhich is expected to be 2 years. The land used temporarily will also be restored by the contractor \nto the original condition; the contractors will deposit funds with Longnan Land and Resources \nOffice to ensure this restoration is completed properly. \n ", "60  Appendix 18 \n5.  For  structures  to  be  demolished,  replacement  value  will  be  provided  to  the  affected \nhouseholds based on compensation rates adopted in Longnan which range from CNY350 to \nCNY450 per square meter for brick-concrete structure, CNY250 to CNY350 per square meter for \nbrick-wood  structure,  and  CNY150  to  250  per  square  meter  for  earth-wood  structure.  The \nrelocation  will  provide  an  opportunity  to  improve  current  housing  conditions  for  relocated \nhouseholds. Most of these households will be moved a short distance to another site within their \noriginal group or village. Rural housing will either be built (i) in a scattered manner beside \nroadways, or (ii) in a clustered manner close to existing settlements; all sites will be provided with \nwater  supply,  electricity,  telephone,  and  TV  cable.  There  will  be  no  reduction  in  house \ncompensation for depreciation, and people can salvage materials from their old houses.  \n6.  GPCD will assume the overall responsibility for implementing resettlement according to \nthe approved resettlement plans. For the expressway component, a Resettlement Division within \nthe Gansu Changda Highway Company Limited (GCHC) will be directly responsible to coordinate \nthe planning, implementation, financing and reporting of land acquisition and resettlement for the \nexpressway and connector roads. A resettlement leading group and resettlement office was \nestablished in Longnan prefecture on 21 February 2006. Offices will also be set up in Wudu \nDistrict and Wenxian County, and staff will be assigned in all affected townships and villages to \nimplement resettlement. The county land and resources offices will take the primary responsibility \nfor  the  resettlement  consultation,  implementation  and  timely  delivery  of  entitlements,  with \nassistance from townships and villages concerned. \n7.  The  1998  Land  Administration  Law  requires  disclosure  and  consultation  with  APs. \nAffected villages have been notified about the key elements of the resettlement plan during \nmeetings and interviews. Resettlement information was disclosed through newspapers to all \naffected persons in April and May 2006. During detailed resettlement planning, there will be \nfurther notifications and consultations to discuss specific impacts and how they will be addressed. \nThe county, township and village officials have ensured that any concerns raised by the people \naffected will be quickly addressed. \n8.  The  plan  for  internal  and  external  monitoring  and  evaluation  is  included  in  both \nresettlement plans. The GCHC will engage a qualified domestic monitor to carry out independent \nresettlement monitoring and evaluation. The monitor will ascertain whether APs have (i) received \ntheir full entitlements on time; and (ii) fully restored their livelihoods, income levels, and living \nstandards.  The  monitor  will  conduct  a  baseline  survey  prior  to  resettlement,  semi-annual \ninvestigations during resettlement and annual survey updates for two years after the completion \nof resettlement. The household survey will include a representative number of those severely \naffected by loss of land, those losing housing, and those classified as economically vulnerable. \nThe monitor will provide ADB and GPCD with copies of the monitoring and evaluation reports \ntwice a year during resettlement implementation, and once a year after resettlement completion \nfor at least 2 years. For the expressway component, an internal monitoring and reporting system \nwill be established in the Resettlement Division of GCHC and report to ADB on the progress of \nland  acquisition  and  resettlement  through  quarterly  progress  reports  and  a  resettlement \ncompletion report. For the other project components, internal monitoring will be done by GPCD \nand the land and resources bureaus; progress will be reported to ADB every 6 months. \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20070112112559+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20061125144935+08'00'", "Title": "Microsoft Word - RRP_Gansu_Final.doc", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Author": "LPC", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 6.0 (Windows)"}}
