INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support the strengthening of \nfiscal, debt, and public financial management (PFM) in Papua New Guinea (PNG) to mitigate \nfiscal and debt sustainability risks, which have been aggravated by the coronavirus disease \n(COVID-19) pandemic. The TA builds upon existing support of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nfor PFM in PNG, including for health sector reforms, PFM reform, and fiscal management.1 It will \nprovide (i) policy assessments on PFM issues to inform government planning; and (ii) support for \ncapacity development in public sector management in prioritized areas. \n \n2.  The  TA  is  aligned  with  ADB's  Strategy  2030  operational  priority  6  (strengthening \ngovernance and institutional capacity).2 It also reflects ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for \nPNG, 2021\u20132025, Strategic Pathway 2 priority areas of improving fiscal, debt, and PFM, and \nresponding to shocks.3 The TA is included in the country operations business plan for PNG, 2021\u2013\n2023.4 It also aligns with the Government of Papua New Guinea\u2019s PFM reform agenda and \ncountry development plans.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Development and economic context. PNG is a lower middle-income country, classified \nas a fragile and conflict-affected situation, that faces significant development challenges, including \ninstitutional weaknesses and capacity constraints.6 Annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth \naveraged only 2.1% from 2016 to 2020, dragged down by a series of shocks that included a \ndecline in commodity prices, a severe drought, and a major earthquake.7 The COVID-19 crisis \nresulted in an estimated 3.3% contraction in the GDP in 2020. A significant 37.5% of the \npopulation lives below the national poverty line.8 Gender equality remains a challenge and women \nhave substantially less access to health care and education services than men.9 \n \n4.  Public sector management. The public sector plays a key role in helping government \nmanage macroeconomic risks and improve development outcomes. However, fiscal outcomes \nhave  generally  been  poor,  symptomatic  of  capacity  constraints  in  fiscal  management  and \nvulnerability to exogenous shocks. PNG\u2019s budget deficit averaged 4.7% from 2016 to 2020. \n \n1  ADB. Papua New Guinea: Supporting Public Financial Management; ADB.

The 2020 International Monetary Fund (IMF) Staff-Monitored Program \nhas helped direct reform priorities.12 \n \n5.  Weak fiscal management. Fiscal management is guided by a comprehensive medium-\nterm fiscal strategy (MTFS) and the Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRA).13 However, both the MTFS \nand FRA have been subject to frequent revisions since 2016, contributing to weaker fiscal \noutcomes.14 There is a need to strengthen medium-term, policy-based budgeting given the \nfrequency of shocks and the continued fiscal difficulties that are expected to affect PNG post-\npandemic. The government will also need support in adhering to fiscal strategies and fiscal rules \nand improving the content and coverage of budget documents. In turn, this will require stronger \nmacroeconomic  forecasting  and  improved  budget  reliability.  ADB  has  been  supporting  the \ngovernment in many of these areas, but more support is needed.15 Because budgets can be a \ntool for supporting gender equality and raising awareness of how budgets affect different groups \nof people, the government also requires assistance in gender-responsive budgeting and gender \nanalysis of the budget.16 \n \n6.  Debt management vulnerabilities. The increase in public debt since 2020, driven by the \nCOVID-19 pandemic has reemphasized the need for prudent debt management. Public debt \nincreased from 33.7% of GDP in 2016 to 49.2% in 2020. In June 2020, an updated IMF debt \nsustainability analysis indicated that PNG faces a high risk of debt distress.17 The government \nhas revised its medium-term debt strategy, focusing on concessional financing and decreasing \nthe government's reliance on short-term domestic borrowing with the aim of reducing the public \ndebt-to-GDP ratio to under 40%.18 Debt management capacities also need to be enhanced to \naddress shortcomings flagged in various assessments, including (i) insufficient monitoring and \n \n10 Revenues from the mineral and petroleum industries averaged 7.6% of total revenues for 2015\u20132019, compared \nwith an average of 15.1% in 2010\u20132014, prompted by weaker commodity prices and declining oil production. \n11 V.

Port Moresby. \n14 In 2019, the MTFS was revised to allow for increased capital expenditure and some arrears clearance, resulting in a \nfiscal deficit of 5.0% of GDP (above the revised MTFS target of 4.1% of GDP and well above the 2.2% of GDP target \noutlined in the original MTFS). Fiscal rules in the FRA have also been amended and language altered, affecting \nconsolidation efforts; in 2017, a rule requiring that \u201cthe budget will be in balance over the term of the government\u201d \nwas replaced with \u201cthe government\u2019s fiscal strategy will target a zero average annual non-resource primary fiscal \nbalance over the medium term.\u201d \n15 Previous TA has supported (i) the preparation and review of key budget documents, (ii) the development of the MTFS \nand its subsequent revisions, (iii) advice provided on fiscal rules, (iv) review of tax legislation, (v) advice for \nmacroeconomic forecasting, (vi) communication to multiple stakeholders on macro-fiscal conditions, and (vii) day- \nto-day capacity building of staff in fiscal management.

Washington, DC. \n18 The FRA, amended in 2020, establishes a temporary government debt ceiling of up to 60% of GDP, with a \nrequirement for government debt to fall beneath 40% of GDP by 2030. The medium-term debt strategy is outlined \nwithin the MTFS 2018\u20132022. An update to the medium-term debt strategy was provided in the 2021 national budget \nto reflect changing fiscal and debt conditions. \n \n ", "3 \nreporting on public debt liabilities and insufficient and incomplete data accuracy, impacted by \nPNG\u2019s existing debt management system;19 (ii) insufficient debt management guidelines, weak \noperational risk management, and staffing issues; and (iii) gaps in analytical capacity that impede \neffective management of debt vulnerabilities.20 ADB has been supporting debt management and \nthe government has indicated that they would like this support to continue.21 \n \n7.  Inadequate controls on budget execution. Progress has been made in PFM in PNG, \nguided by the 2015 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) road map.22 Notable \nreform success include improvements made in the PFM legal framework, and accelerated rollout \nof an integrated financial management system. From 2019 to 2020, a new PEFA assessment was \ncompleted, and a PFM road map exercise commenced, which is being finalized and will guide \nfurther reform efforts.23 Despite some progress, weaknesses remain in procurement processes, \npayroll audit, and responsiveness to internal audit recommendations.24 Of notable concern are \ndeficiencies in public accounts preparation across various levels of government and for statutory \nauthorities, which affect the successful preparation of PNG\u2019s national accounts. Public financial \ninformation is frequently unaudited, incomplete, not easily available, or significantly delayed. \n \n8.  Lessons learned and development partner coordination. Key lessons for ADB include \nthe need to (i) deliver sustained support and engagement with the Department of Treasury (DOT), \nDepartment of Finance, and other government departments on PFM reforms; (ii) build capacity \nnot just for government counterparts, but also for key decision makers; (iii) maintain sustained \ncommunication with the government and development partners on the reform agenda; and (iv) \nmaintain flexibility to respond to evolving issues and needs. ADB will take into account support \nbeing provided by other bilateral and multilateral development partners who are engaged in PFM \nreforms, including the European Union, the IMF and its Pacific Financial Technical Assistance \nCentre, the World Bank, and the governments of Australia, Japan, and New Zealand.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: prudent management of fiscal policy and \nbudget discipline attained.25 The TA will have the following outcome: PFM strengthened.26 \n \n19 PNG uses the Commonwealth Secretariat Debt Recording and Management System; however, this system is \noutdated and affected by some bugs, and is scheduled for upgrade to the Commonwealth Meridian system.  \n20 The World Bank conducted a debt management performance audit in 2020.  \n21 ADB supported debt management under previous TA. Specific outputs under TA for Supporting Public Financial \nManagement (Phase 3) included (i) communication to multiple stakeholders on debt conditions; (ii) day-to-day \ncapacity building of DOT staff in debt management; (iii) a debt management diagnostic review that identified \ndeficiencies in the quality and completeness of debt data recording and institutional and organizational arrangements; \n(iv) support for migration to the Meridian debt management system; and (v) revisions proposed for existing \nregulations on provisions of debt guarantees.

The report will be officially \npublished together with the new PFM road map following endorsement by the minister of finance and the Prime \nMinister. Two subnational PEFA assessments are being finalized and two additional ones are planned for 2022. \n24 Under previous TA, ADB provided support for strengthening procurement systems and processes.

Output 1: Advice on enhancing fiscal management provided. The TA will support the \ngovernment  in  strengthening  fiscal  and  economic  management  through  high-quality  policy \ndialogue and capacity building. It will produce briefing notes, analytical reports, and background \ninformation that can be incorporated into decision-making and policy dialogue. The TA will \nconduct training workshops to help build capacity in identified areas. Experts will work closely with \nDOT counterparts, but may also support other government departments.27 Areas for support will \nbe  developed  in  consultation  with  the  government  and  are  expected  to  evolve  over  the \nimplementation period. Initially, the TA will cover support for (i) the review and update of fiscal, \nrevenue, and expenditure strategies; (ii) review of the MTFS and FRA, and drafting of other fiscal \nlegislation;  (iii)  drafting  and  review  of  key  budget  documents;  \n(iv) improved budgeting techniques and macroeconomic and fiscal forecasting; and (v) gender-\nresponsive budgeting. 28 Policy advice will incorporate gender considerations wherever feasible. \nWomen will comprise at least 30% of trainees and/or attendees in capacity building workshops \nand events. \n \n11.  Output 2: Improved debt management supported. The TA will support stronger debt \nmanagement through policy advice and technical support for the DOT. The initial scope of work \nidentified with the government is support for (i) increased transparency, debt data accuracy, and \ndebt data completeness, including smooth migration from the current debt recording system to its \nproposed  successor;  (ii)  enhanced  analytical  capacity  of  DOT  staff  for  managing  debt \nvulnerabilities and risks; (iii) development of an updated medium-term public debt strategy for \n2023\u20132027; and (iv) improved communication on debt and more timely availability of debt data, \nincluding the creation of an annual public debt bulletin. \n \n12.  Output  3:  Support  for  strengthening  budget  execution  controls  provided.  In \naccordance with the forthcoming PEFA assessment, the TA will support capacity building of the \nAuditor General\u2019s Office to (i) improve the quality and increase the quantity of financial reporting \noutputs, including for public accounts and statutory authorities; (ii) meet reporting responsibilities, \nwhich will be backed up by an assessment on the backlog of audits and a plan to address delays; \n(iii) follow up on audit findings; and (iv) support an update of the Audit Manual, which will clearly \ndetail responsibilities, timelines, and procedures to follow. At a later stage, the TA will explore \nproviding training to government agencies, public corporations, and provincial entities to improve \nfinancial reporting. The TA will also support the government in reforming its procurement function \nthrough strengthening procurement monitoring, methods, public access to information, and other \npriorities identified in the PEFA road map (forthcoming). \n \n13.  Areas of support are expected to evolve over the TA implementation period. TA outputs \nwill be delivered by international and national consultants, working closely with government \ncounterparts and ADB. The experts will deliver a mix of capacity building support involving \nworkshops, group discussions, and on-the-job training. To be effective, consultants will need to \nwork alongside government counterparts in PNG.29 The delivery method builds on lessons from \nprevious ADB policy-based operations and TA that supported PFM (footnote 1).  \n \n27 Other government departments may include the Department of Planning, the Department of Finance, and the Prime \nMinister\u2019s Office. \n28 The TA will provide flexible assistance for strengthening domestic resource mobilization and complement support \nprovided by the IMF and ADB\u2019s Asia Pacific Tax Hub.   \n29 The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could delay the start date of some assignments. However, once working \nrelationships are established, consultants can provide some support remotely. \n \n ", "5 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,500,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 7). The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix \n2. The government will provide counterpart support in the form of staff, office space, office \nsupplies, secretarial assistance, domestic transportation, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  ADB, through its Pacific Department, will administer the knowledge and support TA over \na 5-year period, from January 2022 to December 2026. Implementation will be harmonized with \nADB\u2019s other activities in PNG through the resident mission and will be coordinated with ADB \ndepartments such as the Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department and the \nProcurement, Portfolio, and Financial Management Department.
