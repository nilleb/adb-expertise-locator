INTRODUCTION \n1.  Promoting the availability and use of clean energy is one of the highest priorities of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB). In 2010, ADB funded nearly $1.76 billion worth of projects with \nclean-energy components, exceeding its $1 billion target for the third year in a row. From 2013, \nthis target will increase to $2 billion a year. The Asia and Pacific region, where demand for \nenergy is projected to almost double by 2030, could start using clean power from sustainable \nsolar energy and other renewable sources within the next 3 years.  \n \n2.  In May 2010, ADB announced its Asia Solar Energy Initiative. From 2010 to 2012 it will \nfinance 3,000 megawatts (MW) of solar power generation projects to (i) keep the region abreast \nof technological developments in solar energy, (ii) identify and develop large-capacity solar \nprojects, and (iii) design incentives and innovative financing for the rapid diffusion of solar \ntechnology for both grid-connected and distributed stand-alone power generation.  \n \n3.  As  of  31 January 2011,  coal-fueled  power  plants  accounted  for  54.4%  of  India\u2019s \ngeneration capacity of 170,000 MW. Renewable energy sources (wind, small hydro, biogas, etc. \nplus a negligible amount of solar-grid-connected power) contributed only about 16,787 MW, or a \nlittle  less  than  10%  of  the  total.1 India  has  4\u20137 kilowatt-hours  per  square  meter  of  solar \nirradiation per day with better-than-average irradiation in its western and southeastern regions. \nRecognizing the country\u2019s solar power potential and the possibility of strengthening energy \nsecurity with that renewable resource, the Expert Committee Report on the Integrated Energy \nPolicy of the Government of India (adopted in 2008) recommended that a technology mission be \nformed to make solar power more economically attractive. The Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar \nMission (JNNSM) was launched by the government in January 2010 to promote research and \ndevelopment and technology transfer, and to look into the establishment of knowledge hubs for \nsolar energy and smart-grid development. With support from the JNNSM, India is expected to \ndevelop  1,000\u20132,000 MW  of  utility  grid  power  by  2013,  4,000\u201310,000 MW  by  2017,  and \n20,000 MW by 2022. Off-grid solar applications of up to 200 MW are also foreseen by 2013, \n1,000 MW by 2017, and 2,000 MW by 2022. The South Asia Department of ADB is backing a \nproposed loan to the state government of Gujarat for the evacuation of power from the 580 MW \nCharankha solar park, the first phase of the solar program. The Private Sector Operations \nDepartment of ADB will provide a partial credit guarantee for lenders to solar projects, and direct \nloans where possible. \n \n4.  In pursuit of the goals set by the JNNSM, the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)\u2013 \nRajasthan at Jodhpur has proposed the establishment of the International Center for Application \nof Solar Energy Technologies (ICASET) to carry out research and development in and deploy \nsolar energy technologies, benchmark technologies, and develop human resources in the area \nof solar energy. At the same time, other knowledge institutions are developing and expanding \ntheir capacity development and technology transfer functions to mainstream solar power and \nsmart-grid development. In this regard, technical assistance (TA) for the establishment and \noperation of ICASET and other agencies, such as the government of Gujarat, is proposed to \nsupport the JNNSM.2 \n                                                 \n1  Information available from the Central Electricity Authority of India. \n2   The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 15 March 2011. \n ", "2   \nII.  ISSUES \n5.  Solar energy is regarded as one of the fastest-growing electricity technologies in recent \nyears. Improvements in technology, cost structure, enabling policies, and regulatory frameworks \nhave driven its spectacular growth in developed countries. Solar energy has many implications \nalso for developing member countries (DMCs) in Asia and the Pacific because (i) economies of \nscale can reduce costs to make solar energy competitive with conventional energy resources; \n(ii) some DMCs have greater solar radiation, more rapid growth in electricity demand, and more \navailable land than developed countries; and (iii) some DMCs have the potential to become \nglobal and regional manufacturing hubs for solar technology goods and equipment. \n \n6.  However, the private sector tends to perceive this market as high risk for the following \nreasons,  among  others:  (i) limited  capacity  in  the  DMCs  to  formulate  and  implement  a \nsustainable  policy  and  regulatory  framework  for  solar  power,  (ii) uncertainty  in  adapting \ndeveloped-country technologies to meet DMC needs, and (iii) lack of reliable and innovative \nfinancing. Technology transfer and development of stakeholder capacity in line with JNNSM \nefforts should settle these misgivings.  \n \n7.  Strategy 20203 calls for knowledge solutions that will leverage ADB\u2019s central position in \nidentifying trends across the region, its interdisciplinary and integrated approach to assistance, \nand  its  capacity  to  implement  insights  and  knowledge  with  significant  financing  support. \nTogether, ADB and its development partners can facilitate technology transfer and knowledge \nsharing  to  create  an  enabling  environment  for  solar  power  development.  As  a  regional \nknowledge institution, ADB is mandated to (i) support pilot projects from which lessons can be \ndistilled and disseminated, and (ii) distribute knowledge in ways that have both immediate \nimpact  and  catalytic  force.  The  support  provided  is  expected  to  mainstream  solar  power \ndevelopment, successfully demonstrate the utility of solar energy in power generation and other \napplications and ease its progress toward eventual parity with other energy sources, and result \nin the development of relevant energy applications in remote areas.  \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n8.  This  proposed  capacity  development  TA  will  help  develop  capacity  and  transfer \ntechnology to mainstream solar energy and stable grid development in line with the JNNSM. In \nparticular, the TA will help IIT\u2013Rajasthan and other agencies, e.g., the state government of \nGujarat,  to  institutionalize  and  operationalize  solar  energy  and  smart-grid  development \nfunctions.  It  will  support  knowledge  institutions  in  capacity  development,  research  and \ndevelopment, technology transfer and deployment, knowledge sharing, and pilot testing in solar \nthermal and solar photovoltaic energy, hybrid solar energy, smart grids, and thermal-to-cooling \nand thermal-to-thermal technologies. The TA complements the recently approved ADB TA for \nCapacity Building for Commercial Bank Lending for Solar Energy Projects in India.4  \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2008.

The technology transfer will center on (i) thermal storage materials; (ii) heat exchanger \ndesign; (iii) solar photovoltaic systems; (iv) smart grids, including direct-current micro-grids and \nbattery storage systems; (v) hybrid technologies; and (vi) innovative, value-added applications \nof solar energy such as solar air-conditioning, solar materials and chemical processing, and \nwater purification. An important aspect of developing the solar energy market in Asia and Pacific \nwill be the benchmarking of different technologies, i.e., single-crystalline silicon, polycrystalline \nsilicon, thin-film, and multilayer solar photovoltaic cells, as well as parabolic troughs, Fresnel \nreflectors,  central  receivers,  and  parabolic  dishes  for  solar  thermal  energy.  To  enable \nbenchmarking, the establishment of a megawatt-scale solar plant using different technologies is \nproposed. ICASET plans to procure and install suitable monitoring, analytical, and evaluation \nequipment  (hardware  and  software)  with  resources  mobilized  through  public\u2013private \npartnership. The TA will assist ICASET and the Gujarat government in these activities. The \n ", "4   \nfacilities to be developed by ICASET and the other agencies will be integrated with a smart \nalternating-current power system and a direct-current micro grid for demonstration, and the \npower generated will be supplied to the grid. The consultants will support ICASET in developing \nand operating the plant. \n \n14.  Capacity  development.  The  TA  will  assist  ICASET  and  the  other  agencies  in \ndeveloping and implementing a capacity development program for various stakeholders in India, \nincluding (i) state governments, (ii) regulators, (iii) power utilities, (iv) the local private sector, \nand (v) other stakeholders. Human resources exchange programs for professors, researchers, \nand students with universities, research institutes, and the private sector in developed countries \nwill be developed and carried out in collaboration with ADB and other development partners. A \ncapacity development program will also be planned for other countries in South Asia. The \nconsultants will assist ICASET and the Gujarat government in facilitating such partnerships.  \n \n15.  Knowledge dissemination and business model development. The TA will assist \nICASET and the other agencies in disseminating knowledge on the outcome of the research \nand  pilot-testing  among  the  various  stakeholders,  and  in  providing  a  business  model  and \nsharing it with the relevant agencies and the private sector. These activities will be done in close \ncollaboration with the Asia Solar Energy Forum. The workshops for knowledge sharing will be \nheld in India and abroad. For business model development, the consultants will provide partners \nwith (i) customized solutions for grid or off-grid solar power generation and distribution, and \nindustrial  applications  of  concentrated  solar  power;  (ii) joint  testing,  calibration,  and \nbenchmarking of new and existing technologies; (iii) commercial evaluation of technologies, and \nfeasibility  and  detailed  engineering  project  reports  for  new  solar  power  projects;  and \n(iv) technical and financial audit of solar power plants. \nC.

The total cost of the TA is estimated at $2,400,000 equivalent, of which $2,000,000 will \nbe financed with a grant from the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction administered by ADB. The \nGovernment  of  India  will  finance  (in  kind)  the  remaining  $400,000  equivalent.  The  cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  IIT\u2013Rajasthan (for ICASET) and the government of Gujarat (for operations in the state of \nGujarat) will be the executing agencies. The project implementation period is expected to be 18 \nmonths. As envisaged, 25 person-months of consulting services by six international consultants \nand 60 person-months of consulting services by four national consultants will be required. All \nthe consultants will be individually recruited, as it may be difficult or even impossible to source \nthe broad range of required specializations from a single firm. ADB will recruit consultants \naccording to its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). \nDisbursements  under  the  TA  will  conform  to  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time).  \n \n18.  Equipment will be procured under the TA funds by ADB according to its Procurement \nGuidelines  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  An  advance  payment  facility,  to  be \nreplenished on liquidation, will be used to disburse funds to cover administrative and operating \ncosts.  IIT\u2013Rajasthan and  the state  government  will  be required  to  maintain  operation  and \nadministration accounts, to have these accounts audited annually, and to report the results of \n ", "  5\nthe annual audit to ADB. To facilitate the timely flow of funds and to reduce the administrative \nburden, IIT\u2013Rajasthan and the state government will be provided with a budget for travel \nexpenses under the advance payment facility, to be liquidated monthly. \nIV.
