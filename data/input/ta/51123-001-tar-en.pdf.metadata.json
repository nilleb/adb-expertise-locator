INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  proposed  knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  support \nimprovements in legal and policy frameworks, and data infrastructure for promoting knowledge \nand technology transfer, and commercialization of research and development (R&D) in Mongolia \nthrough  research,  policy  advice,  and  capacity  development.  The  Government  of  Mongolia \nrequested TA from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to strengthen systems for promoting \nscience,  technology,  and  innovation  (STI)  in  accordance  with  the  Action  Program  of  the \nGovernment of Mongolia for 2016\u20132020.1 During the missions conducted in February and June \n2017, ADB and the government reached agreement on the objectives, scope, implementation \narrangements, cost, and consulting service requirements.2 The TA is included in ADB\u2019s country \noperations business plan for Mongolia, 2017\u20132019.3   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Chronic underinvestment has impeded the growth of Mongolia\u2019s STI since the early 1990s \nafter the country transitioned from a centrally planned to a market-based economy. In 2015, gross \ndomestic expenditure on R&D expressed as a percentage of the gross domestic product was \n0.16%, lower than in 1990 (1.0%). This compares unfavorably with the Organisation for Economic \nCo-operation and Development countries (1.0%\u20134.2% of gross domestic product).4 The number \nof R&D personnel (2,515 in 2015) has also been in gradual decline since the mid-1990s (3,102 \nin 1995).5 The main cause of stagnation is that STI in Mongolia has not been well integrated with \nother related sectors.6 Its contribution to the economy, in particular the diversification of the \neconomy,  and  standards  of  living,  through  knowledge  and  technology  transfer  and \ncommercialization of R&D, has been insignificant, which has led to years of neglect. In 2015, only \n34 patents were granted (33 in Mongolia and 1 abroad), while merely 29 prototypes and 45 \ncopyright certificates were issued.7 Moreover, the State Policy on Science and Technology, \napproved in 1998, has already become outdated. Against this background, the Action Program \nspecifies  actions  to  revitalize  STI  by  improving  legal  and  policy  frameworks,  financing \nmechanisms, and research and data infrastructure.8  \n \n3.  The  national  innovation  system  in  Mongolia  is  characterized  by  weak  knowledge \ndissemination, limited technology transfer, and infrequent commercialization of R&D that stem \nfrom various factors. First, institutional arrangements for STI are fragmented. Although the \nMinistry of Education, Culture, Science and Sports (MECSS) is responsible for formulating and \nimplementing STI policies and directly supervising some of the 59 research institutions and 21 \nresearch-based universities (footnote 5), about one-third (20) of public and private research \ninstitutions are supervised by other ministries, while 10 are under the Mongolian Academy of \nSciences. The responsibility for funding R&D is divided between MECSS and the Science and \n                                                \n1  Government of Mongolia. 2016. Action Program for 2016\u20132020. Ulaanbaatar. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 1 August 2017.   \n3  ADB. 2017. Country Operations Business Plan: Mongolia, 2017\u20132019. Manila. \n4  UNESCO Institute for Statistics. http://data.uis.unesco.org/ \n5  Government of Mongolia, Ministry of Education, Culture, Science and Sports (MECSS). 2015. Statistical Year Book: \nEducation and Science (2015\u20132016 Academic Year, 2015 Fiscal Year). Ulaanbaatar.  \n6  Government of Mongolia. 2007. Science and Technology Master Plan of Mongolia, 2007\u20132020. Ulaanbaatar. The \nmaster plan specifies five goals and a number of actions to develop STI.   \n7  The total number of patent grants in other lower middle-income countries is much higher than in Mongolia, e.g., 2,207 \nin the Philippines, 184 in Uzbekistan, and 1,182 in Viet Nam in 2013 (World Intellectual Property Organization. 2014. \nWorld Intellectual Property Indicators. Geneva).  \n8  Major laws governing STI include the Law on Science and Technology, 2006; Law on Intellectual Property, 2006; \nLaw on Innovation, 2012; and Government Resolution on Core Technology, 2015.  \n ", "2 \nTechnology Foundation. Second, related to the fragmented institutional arrangements, data, \ninformation, and knowledge generated by R&D are not readily available and no comprehensive \nrepository, database, and platform is in place through which quality information on R&D projects \nand researchers can be accessed. Third, incentives of R&D institutions and professionals are not \nwell aligned, especially with those of firms with weak in-house R&D capacity. Fourth, funds and \nfacilities for R&D, in particular for developing prototypes and demonstration projects, have been \ninsufficient to interest private investors in the commercialization of R&D.  \n \n4.  Intellectual property-based knowledge and technology transfer (patents and licenses) has \nnot been functioning adequately in Mongolia. The number of patents sold in the market has been \nlimited partly by the uncertainty of their value. The underlying issue is that the method and \nstandards for intellectual property rights (IPR) valuation have not been well established, and that \nquality assurance mechanisms in granting IPR are not in place to ensure their quality and validity. \nIn the case of public R&D, which accounts for more than 90% of the total R&D in Mongolia, the \nownership of IPR is not always clear, which poses challenges to forming joint ventures in \ncommercializing public R&D. Similarly, other mechanisms for knowledge and technology transfer, \nsuch as technology transfer offices and technology licensing offices, are still in the early stages \nof development.   \n \n5.  The extremely low level of investment in STI has resulted in obsolete research and data \ninfrastructure in Mongolia, which fall short of international comparators. Quality R&D is highly \ncontingent  on  technological  development,  and  requires  sophisticated  research  and  data \ninfrastructure that need to be constantly upgraded and renewed, and adequately operated and \nmaintained. This implies that not only initial investments in research and data infrastructure are \nneeded but also continuous investment, as well as daily operations and maintenance performed \nby skilled personnel. As of August 2017, MECSS is drafting a renewed State Policy on Science \nand Technology, and an STI human resources development plan, 2017\u20132027. These plans need \nto be accompanied by an STI investment plan that identifies and prioritizes investments in \nresearch and data infrastructure for STI over the long term.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: STI revitalized (footnote 1). The TA will have \nthe following outcome: systems for promoting STI strengthened.9  \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities  \n7.  Output 1: Study of science, technology, and innovation systems and assessment \nof data infrastructure completed. The TA will support the study of (i) various institutions, \norganizations, and actors in STI (e.g., MECSS and other relevant ministries, the Science and \nTechnology Foundation, the Academy of Science, research institutes, universities, the General \nAgency for Intellectual Property and State Registration, science parks, incubators, banks and \nventure capitalists, and firms); and their capacity (knowledge, skills, resources, and performance) \nfor  R&D,  collaboration  with  other  institutions,  knowledge  and  technology  transfer,  and \ncommercialization; and (ii) the functioning of the IPR market in Mongolia. The TA will also assess \ndata infrastructure for STI, including legal frameworks for the creation and usage of data; \ninformation and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure and services; the number and \n                                                \n9  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "3 \nstatus of data scientists; and the general level of data literacy, computing, and statistical skills. In \naddition, the TA will support a review of policies and programs to promote knowledge and \ntechnology transfer and commercialization; the role of government in promoting knowledge and \ntechnology transfer and commercialization; legal frameworks for open science and IPR; and \ndifferent funding  and  business  models for  online  repositories,  databases,  and  marketplace \nplatforms for STI in emerging and advanced economies. Findings and recommendations of the \nstudy, assessment, and review will be presented and discussed at workshops with participants \nfrom institutions, organizations, and professionals involved in R&D, knowledge and technology \ntransfer, and commercialization (e.g., research institutes, universities, large, small, and medium-\nsized enterprises); intellectual property and data professionals; civil society organizations; as well \nas resource persons from national, regional, and international organizations active in STI.  \n \n8.  Output 2: Online platform for science, technology, and innovation developed. Based \non findings and recommendations of the data infrastructure assessment (output 1), the TA will \nsupport  consultations  with  institutions,  organizations,  and  professionals  involved  in  R&D, \nknowledge and technology transfer, and commercialization on the scope of the online platform \nfor STI. This will include functions, users, operators, funding, and business models to increase \nknowledge and technology transfer and commercialization. Once the scope of the online platform \nfor STI is defined, the TA will assist the preparation of functional and system requirements and \nspecifications, and the development of an online platform for STI. The TA will also support training \nfor platform operators and users.  \n \n9.  Output 3: Improved legal and policy frameworks for intellectual property rights \nprepared. Based on findings and recommendations of the in-depth study and review (output 1), \nand consultations with institutions and professionals involved in R&D, the TA will support the \nidentification of gaps and areas for improvement in the legal and policy frameworks for IPR and \nthe subsequent drafting of amendments to the frameworks with a view to increasing knowledge \nand technology transfer and commercialization of R&D. Draft amendments will be presented and \ndiscussed  at  public  consultation  workshops,  and  feedback  from  the  workshops  will  be \nincorporated into the draft amendments.  \n \n10.  Output 4: Science, technology, and innovation investment plan developed. The TA \nwill support the development of an STI investment plan that takes into account findings and \nrecommendations of the in-depth study, assessment, and review (output 1); and feedback \nreceived through consultations with various institutions, organizations, and actors in STI. The plan \nwill identify and prioritize investments not only in research infrastructure but also in ICT platforms, \nlibraries, and information archives. It will also consider continuous upgrading and renewal of \nresearch  and  ICT  infrastructure,  operation  and  maintenance,  and  development  of  skilled \nprofessionals to use, operate, and maintain research and ICT infrastructure. The plan will indicate \ndifferent funding sources and arrangements (public, private, public\u2013private partnerships, and \ninternational cooperation) for developing research and ICT infrastructure for STI. The draft STI \ninvestment plan will be presented and discussed at STI stakeholder consultation workshops.  \n \n11.  The key risk to the achievement of the outcome is changes in government leadership, \nwhich may adversely affect the institutional arrangements for STI. Frequent management and \nstaff turnover at MECSS, on the other hand, may slow down TA implementation, which is \nconsidered the major risk to the development of the three outputs.    \n ", "4 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $650,000, of which $600,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The key expenditure items are listed in \nAppendix 2. The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, data, \ninformation,  relevant  documents,  and  other  in-kind  contributions.  MECSS  will  ensure  that \nadequate ICT infrastructure (e.g., servers, storage, and operating systems) is provided for the \ndevelopment of the online platform for STI.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  ADB will administer the TA. ADB will select, supervise, and evaluate consultants during \nimplementation of the TA. MECSS will be the executing and implementing agency, and will be \nresponsible for providing guidance and support to consultants engaged under the TA and \ninvolving all relevant institutions during TA implementation, including other relevant ministries, the \nScience and Technology Foundation, the Academy of Science, research institutes, universities, \nand the Intellectual Property Agency. A project steering committee, chaired by the state secretary \nof MECSS, and comprising the directors of MECSS and representatives from relevant institutions, \nwill be established to review implementation progress and provide guidance on a quarterly basis. \nThe TA will be implemented from September 2017 to December 2019. The TA resources will be \ndisbursed following the Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). ADB will engage consulting firms and all TA-financed goods will be procured in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and the \nassociated project administration instructions and TA staff instructions. Equipment purchased will \nbe turned over to MECSS upon TA completion.  \n \nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  September 2017\u2013December 2019 \nExecuting and implementing agency  MECSS \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB  \n  Quality- and cost- 77 person-months  $576,200 \nbased selection \nProcurementa  To be procured by consultants \n  Shopping   1 contract  $10,000 \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \nAsset turnover or disposal  Equipment purchased will be turned over to MECSS upon TA completion. \narrangement upon TA completion \nADB = Asian Development Bank; MECSS = Ministry of Education, Culture, Science and Sports; TA = technical \nassistance.  \na Procurement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \nSource: Asian Development Bank.  \n \n14.  Consulting services. ADB will engage a consulting firm (international, 11 person-months; \nnational, 21 person-months) to provide expertise in conducting an in-depth study of STI systems \nand data infrastructure assessment in Mongolia; performing a review of STI policy, institutional \nand legal frameworks, and data infrastructure in emerging and advanced economies; drafting \namendments to laws and policies on IPR; and developing an STI investment plan. ADB will also \nengage a national consulting firm (45 person-months) to develop an online platform for STI. The \n ", "5 \nfirm will procure equipment to carry out the assignment. The consulting firms will be selected \nusing the quality- and cost-based selection method with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10, and \nsimplified technical proposals. Output-based, lump-sum contracts with a provision for fixed out-\nof-pocket expenditures will be considered for the consulting firms.10 \n \n15.  The TA will be monitored and evaluated based on the implementation of activities and \nsatisfactory delivery of outputs following the agreed timeline and budget. To support monitoring \nand evaluation, the consultants will submit an inception report, a midterm report, a draft final \nreport, and a final report to ADB and MECSS. The main mechanism to monitor and assess the \nTA will be review missions jointly conducted by ADB and MECSS.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to the \nGovernment of Mongolia for the Strengthening Systems for Promoting Science, Technology, and \nInnovation, and hereby reports this action to the Board.   \n \n \n \n                                                \n10  Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the TA is Aligned with \nScience, technology, and innovation revitalized (Action Program for 2016\u20132020)a \nResults Chain  Performance Indicators with  Data Sources and  Risks \nTargets and Baselines  Reporting \nOutcome  By the end of 2020     \nSystems for  a.
