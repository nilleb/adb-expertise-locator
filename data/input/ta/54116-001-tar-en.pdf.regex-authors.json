INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The  knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  generate  policy-relevant \nknowledge on population aging by (i) supporting the development of internationally comparable \nsurvey-based  panel  databases  on  aging  in  selected  Asian  countries;  and  (ii)  coordinating \ncomparative and demonstrative studies in selected Asian countries to provide the region\u2019s \ngovernments with information to reform health and social security policies and to craft policies to \nadapt to population aging. \n \n2.  To implement the recommendation of the Shared Understanding on the Importance of \nUniversal Health Care Financing in Developing Countries and the Fukuoka Policy Priorities \non Aging and Financial Inclusion endorsed at the Group of Twenty (G20) Osaka Summit in \n2019, the TA will generate and disseminate policy-relevant knowledge to policy makers on \npromoting healthy and productive aging. The TA is aligned with Strategy 2030 of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) and follows its key operational priorities of tackling remaining poverty \nand reducing inequalities. The TA will help strengthen social security systems and improve \nprovision of health care and financial services to vulnerable groups, especially the elderly, via \nsocial inclusion, better health for all, and social protection. Although not a part of the 2020 annual \nwork program of the Economic Research and Regional Cooperation Department (ERCD), the TA \nis proposed as a special follow-up project to the G20 recommendation to further universal health \ncare (UHC) financing and will contribute to resilience to pandemic shocks such as the coronavirus \ndisease (COVID-19).1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Asia is aging rapidly. From 2020 to 2050, the population share of those 65 years old and \nabove will double from 8.9% to 18.0%, exceeding the global average of 15.9%.2 Rapid population \naging poses new challenges for adequate yet sustainable health care, social security, and \npensions. Many developing Asian economies face the risk of growing old before they become \nrich.3 The working-age population (ages 15\u221264) will gradually decline, and the decline is likely to \nbe drastic in some economies. However, population aging need not slow down economic growth \nif  countries  adopt  appropriate  new  technologies  and  policies.  Tackling  the  challenges  of \npopulation aging requires a better understanding of the socioeconomic consequences of aging \nand the state of older people. Such knowledge can foster forward-looking policies that maximize \nthe opportunities associated with aging. For example, well-designed policies can improve older \npeople's health and productivity and thus extend their working lives, which would be a boon to \neconomies.4 \n \n4.  Promoting UHC can improve the elderly\u2019s access to health care, which is vital to their \nwelfare and productivity. As life expectancy increases, treating noncommunicable diseases and \nproviding long-term and palliative care become higher priorities. Disabilities, particularly cognitive \nimpairments such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease and related dementias, are expected to become more \nprevalent, with substantial health, social, and economic implications. Sound and broad-based \n \n1   The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 15 July 2020. \n2  United Nations. 2019.

G20 leaders recognized the importance \nof UHC and endorsed the Shared Understanding under Japan\u2019s leadership in 2019. G20 leaders, \nincluding  Australia,  India,  Indonesia,  Japan,  and  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC), \nunderscored  the  \u201cpower  of  an  early  start  and  preparedness  for  the  future\u201d  and  called  for \ndeveloping member countries (DMCs) to invest in health care for the elderly.5 \n \n5.  Besides health, another challenge is old-age income security in DMCs, which often lack \ncomprehensive pension or social protection systems. Longevity can exacerbate inequality and \nincrease the vulnerability of the elderly, especially women with little or no income.6 Alongside \nreforms to strengthen pension and social security systems, countries must invest in financial \ninclusion to prepare their citizens for longer lives. Thus, research is needed to assess financial \ninclusion and financial literacy, which influence access to financial services and postretirement \nfinancial preparedness, and to evaluate the effectiveness of financial literacy pilot programs.  \n \n6.  Aging countries can turn the demographic headwind to tailwind by harvesting the \u201csilver \ndividend\u201d from older workers who are healthy, educated, and experienced.7 Education, skills \ndevelopment, and lifelong learning must be promoted to upgrade skills. Physical augmentation \ntechnologies  that  aid  mobility  and  endurance  will  help  the  elderly  remain  productive. \nUnderstanding the employment patterns of older workers and evaluating the effectiveness of \npolicies and programs that promote their work participation are much needed across DMCs. Since \nthe policy environment is vital in shaping labor force participation, policy makers will benefit from \nstandardized cross-country studies that yield comparable evidence on health, education and other \npolicy outcomes, which provide reliable benchmarks for policy assessment and enable knowledge \nsharing based on experiences of early adopters. \n \n7.  Quality data and rigorous analysis of health, population aging, and other related topics \nhelp governments monitor aging-related developments. They can thus make informed decisions \nwhen they reform health and social security systems and craft policies to adapt to population \naging. For example, panel surveys of older individuals, such as the Health and Retirement Study8 \nand its \u201cfamily\u201d surveys around the globe, as well as the National Transfer Account database, \nhave significantly informed policymakers about the changing dynamics of demographics, health \nendowments, financial status, and inclusion of elders.9 \n \n8.  The TA will customize its knowledge support according to data availability in DMCs and \ntheir  readiness  to  collect  data.  For  DMCs  with  available  panel  data  series  that  meet  the \nrequirement of rigorous quantitative analysis, the TA will provide financial support to produce \ninternationally comparable and quantitatively rigorous research using country-specific data. This \nstrand of research support will cover Thailand, Sri Lanka, and Viet Nam (and possibly the PRC, \nwhich has panel datasets of older persons). For DMCs that do not have national aging data but \nhave shown interest and readiness to initiate data collection and strengthen research capacity, \nthe TA will provide financial support to help them build datasets, strengthen capacity in conducting \n \n5  The TA contributes to implementing the Kuala Lumpur Declaration on Aging: Empowering Older Persons in ASEAN, \nwhich reaffirms the shared responsibility among Association of Southeast Asian Nations members in promoting \nhealthy and active aging. \n6  United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs.

The TA will promote internationally comparable studies and facilitate \nknowledge sharing.10 The analysis of DMCs at different levels of development and population \naging will thus yield relevant implications for policy makers across the entire region. \n \n9.  The TA will respond to DMCs\u2019 need for data and for research that monitors and analyzes \nthe characteristics of the elderly while exploring new benchmarks and methodologies: the needs \nof the elderly; the extent of their social protection coverage, including UHC; and other policy-\nrelevant attributes. In collaboration with leading academic institutions, the TA will build DMCs\u2019 \ncapacity to collect and analyze data. Given that the regional economies are at different stages of \npopulation aging, the TA will expedite and finance standardized cross-country research that \ngenerates comparable reference and foster knowledge sharing that benefits all economies in the \nregion. Better research capacity and standardized evidence-based policy analysis contribute to \noverall economic and social stability by helping the region better adapt to population aging. \n \n10.  The TA builds on existing ADB TA projects such as Strengthening Developing Member \nCountries\u2019 Capacity in Elderly Care,11 lessons from which include the following: (i) the multisector \nscope of aging means that multiple sectors and stakeholders must be engaged to influence policy; \n(ii) research and recommendations must cover current and future cohorts of older persons and \nprovide better policy context for countries with predominantly young populations; and (iii) research \ncapacity must be improved, including data collection and analysis, to support evidence-based \npolicy making. The TA will primarily respond to the last item. The TA will collaborate with ADB\u2019s \nTA for Developing Innovative Community-Based Long-Term Care Systems and Services to cross-\nfertilize generated knowledge, support DMCs through the joint organization of knowledge-sharing \nand capacity-building events, and build synergy by leveraging common national and regional \nnetworking platforms and research institutions for multisector collaboration.12 \n \n11.  Pandemic impacts. The elderly are highly vulnerable to infectious diseases and their \nassociated social and economic shocks. COVID-19 disproportionately affects the elderly and \nposes a serious threat to their well-being.13 Therefore, the age profile of COVID-19\u2019s effects, \nespecially on older persons, must be tracked. The TA will incorporate such impacts in its data \ncollection and research. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impacts and Outcome \n \n12.  The TA is aligned with the following impacts: remaining poverty and inequalities reduced \namong developing Asia\u2019s vulnerable population, particularly the elderly and especially the female \nelderly; social protection systems and provision of health care and financial services strengthened \nin developing Asia; and the regional public good of fostering healthy and productive aging \n \n10 The TA will also study data from Japan, the Republic of Korea, and the United States to provide a basis for \ncomparative studies and enrich policy recommendations. \n11 ADB. 2016.

Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n13.  Output 1: Quality datasets on healthy and productive aging for targeted DMCs \nenhanced. In collaboration with academic institutions and research institutes, the TA will support \nand finance the collection of panel data on aging population in three countries: Bangladesh and \nIndonesia16 because they do not have panel surveys for collecting data on the economic, social, \nand health status of older persons; and Malaysia17 because it has started a pilot survey, which \nthe TA can build on. The TA may include questions that evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on the \nelderly in the surveys or a specific survey module on COVID-19.18 The TA will finance surveys \nand organize capacity-building workshops in collaboration with leading institutions with expertise \nin rolling out similar surveys.19 The sample size of the surveys may vary by country, depending \non the context and the country\u2019s policy environment or objectives.20 The information collected by \nthe TA will be anonymized and made available to policy makers and researchers, subject to \nreview.21 \n  \n14.  Output 2. Innovative research on healthy and productive aging promoted and \ndisseminated. To complement the project-generated datasets from output 1, existing aging-\nrelated panel datasets from Thailand, Sri Lanka, and Viet Nam (and possibly the PRC, which has \na panel dataset of older persons), which have rapidly aging populations, will be used to produce \n20 research papers which cover topics that correspond to G20 recommendations. The papers will \nalso cover advanced economies in Asia, such as Japan and the Republic of Korea, and other \ncountries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, to provide a good \nreference for comparative studies. The TA will prioritize innovative multidisciplinary research and \ninvestigate the health, economic, and social status of older persons. Commissioned papers will \n(i) evaluate the role of UHC in an aging society and assess the costs and benefits of health care \n(five studies); (ii) measure the silver dividend and monitor the physical and cognitive ability of \nolder persons (five studies); (iii) examine financial inclusion of older persons (three studies); and \n(iv) analyze employment of older persons, the role of technology, and the gender dimensions of \n \n14 ADB. 2018.

Commissioned papers, upon \nreview, will be published online as working papers. One executive report summarizing the \nresearch output will be published. Its key contents will be distilled into policy briefs, blogs, and \nsocial media items to reach a wider audience and generate greater impact. \n \n15.  Output 3. Standardized and comparable cross-country evidence-based knowledge \non aging-related policy measures and assessment techniques developed. The TA will \nsupport and implement the first multi-country comparative study on population aging in the region, \nusing standardized methodology and harmonized data to enable cross-country comparison and \nlearning. The study will cover all target countries and others, including advanced economies that \nare more experienced in coping with population aging. Standardized cross-country research will \nhelp policy makers assess aging-related issues and develop policy measures with comparable \nbenchmarks. A research conference will be organized, based on a call for research papers, \ninviting up to 25 scholars or experts who specialize in cross-country comparisons based on micro \nsurveys of older persons. The conference will identify a suitable topic for the standardized \ncomparison research. Examples include the employment patterns of older persons, financial \nliteracy, and their health status. The comparative study will be published as a special online report. \n  \n16.  Output  4.  Knowledge  dissemination  and  capacity  building  on  healthy  and \nproductive aging strengthened. The TA will disseminate the data and knowledge generated \nfrom  output  1  to  output  3  to  policy  makers,  researchers,  ADB  operations  and  knowledge \ndepartments, and other stakeholders through conferences, workshops, and webinars and other \nvirtual outreach.  Audiences include both TA-targeted countries and other DMCs in the region. \nAdditional dissemination may target regional and global platforms such as the Asia-Pacific \nEconomic Cooperation, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and G20. The TA team will \nrespond to requests from ADB departments and DMCs to provide capacity-building activities and \ncustomized knowledge products, including UHC-related knowledge products, based on the TA \ndata and research, to support ADB operations. \n \n17.  The project team will work closely with Japan-based institutions that have abundant \nexperience in studying aging and constructing datasets on older persons, such as the Japanese \nStudy of Aging and Retirement. The team will draw on Japan\u2019s extensive experience in providing \nUHC and implementing policies to adapt to population aging, including pension reforms and long-\nterm care insurance. The TA will explore collaboration with the University of Tokyo, the Asian \nDevelopment Bank Institute, the Japan International Cooperation Agency Research Institute, \nNihon University, and the University of Tsukuba. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) and administered by ADB. The key expenditure items \nare listed in Appendix 2. \n \n \n22 The TA project will work with networks of scholars to identify target countries. For example, UHC studies might draw \nfrom countries with UHC, such as Thailand, while financial inclusion studies will focus on countries with sufficient \ndata on financial literacy among older persons, including Japan, the Republic of Korea, and the United States. \n ", "6 \n19.  The following are ineligible items under the JFPR: (i) purchase of vehicles, (ii) salaries for \ncivil servants, (iii) foreign travel,23 (iv) scholarships or long internships, (v) detailed engineering \ndesign, (vi) civil works and other related expenses, and (vii) those under ADB\u2019s List of Ineligible \nItems (or Negative List) and Prohibited Investment Activities List. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n20.  ADB will administer the TA. ERCD will be responsible for supervision and management of \nconsultants;  procurement;  and  accomplishment,  monitoring,  and  evaluation  of  the  outputs. \nCollaboration  with  institutional  bodies  or  universities  may  be  explored  through  knowledge \npartnership or cooperation agreements to conduct the surveys. To maximize ADB\u2019s experience \nand knowledge, ERCD will coordinate with other departments and resident missions to identify \nDMC participants, recommend research partners, and/or be resource persons at workshops and \nconferences. \n \n21.
