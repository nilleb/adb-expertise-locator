INTRODUCTION \n1.  Strategy  2020  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  prioritizes  governance  and \ncapacity  development  as  drivers  of  change,  and  puts  them  in  the  mainstream  of  ADB \noperations.1 As a catalyst for change in these areas, ADB aims to stimulate inclusive economic \ngrowth,  foster  cost-effective  delivery  of  public  goods  and  services  in  developing  member \ncountries (DMCs), and enhance development effectiveness. \n \n2.  The  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  support  the  implementation  of  Strategy  2020\u2019s \ngovernance and capacity development objectives in participating DMCs.2 Presently, all country \npartnership strategies (CPSs) address governance and capacity issues, in part through the \nmandatory  requirement  for  CPSs  and  operations  in  priority  sectors  to  be  informed  by \ngovernance risk assessments (GRAs).3 Sector operational plans also reflect the need for better \ngovernance and institutional performance to achieve sector objectives. The TA responds to the \nfindings of ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 and directly supports implementation of the \nmidterm review action plan.4 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  ADB\u2019s  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020  observed  that  weak  governance  and \ninstitutional capacities continue to constrain the development prospects of many DMCs, and \nthat corruption and lack of accountability and transparency, in particular, impede the effective \ndelivery of basic services and the benefits of growth from being widely shared (footnote 4). This \nfinding is consistent with ADB operational results, where weak local institutional capacity and/or \nlack  of  government  support  are  major  reasons  for  less  successful  sovereign  operations.6 \nMeanwhile, ADB\u2019s stakeholders perceive corruption as the greatest threat to development in \nAsia and the Pacific.7 Measured by ADB\u2019s country performance assessment (CPA) ratings, \ngovernance and public sector performance in the region have improved overall, but significant \nchallenges  remain.8 The  region  displays  contrasting  and  varied  patterns  of  development \nperformance that require different policy and institutional responses. \n \n4.  ADB strategies recognize the complementarity of governance and capacity development. \nThe  Second  Governance  and  Anticorruption  Action  Plan  (GACAP  II)  aims  to  strengthen \ngovernance  institutions  in  DMCs  by  applying  a  risk-based  approach  to  mainstreaming \ngovernance  in  three  priority  areas\u2014public  financial  management  (PFM),  procurement,  and \ncombating corruption.9 ADB\u2019s approach to capacity development is expressed in the 2007 \nMedium-Term Framework and Action Plan for capacity development.10 \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2008.

Manila. \n ", "2  \n5.  ADB\u2019s performance in mainstreaming governance and capacity development in country \nprogramming and operations has been mixed. The quality of country-, sector-, and project-level \nplans to assess and manage governance risks has not been uniform and requires systematic \nimprovement, including in implementation.11 Depending on each DMC\u2019s development context, \ngovernance  and  capacity  development  issues  need  to  be  firmly  anchored  in  country \nprogramming  and  operations,  including  sector  assessments  and  road  maps.  Independent \nstudies also call for improved governance and capacity analytics and strengthened GACAP II \nimplementation.12 \n \n6.  The Strategy 2020 Midterm Review Action Plan opens the space for ADB to enhance \nthe  quality  of  its  governance  and  capacity  development  support  (footnote  4).  It  prioritizes \nresources for capacity development in operations, GACAP II implementation, and public sector \nmanagement  operations  (action  5.3.5).  Enhancing  the  quality  of  GRAs\u2014GACAP  II\u2019s  chief \noperational instrument\u2014is prioritized (action 1.4). A capacity development operational plan is to \nbe prepared (action 1.3.4). Other midterm review actions, such as incorporating a \u201cOne ADB\u201d \napproach to knowledge solutions, strengthening of resident missions, and implementing the \nenvisioned  reforms  to  make  business  processes  agile  and  flexible,  will  also  help  improve \ngovernance and capacity development.   \n \n7.  The international development community\u2019s commitment to strengthen governance and \ninstitutional  capacities  was  reaffirmed  in  the  Sustainable  Development  Goals  (SDGs), \nparticularly SDG16, which aims to \u201cbuild effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all \nlevels\u201d  and  SDG17,  which  aims  to  enhance  the  effectiveness  of  capacity  development  to \ndeveloping countries.13 The commitment is also contained in international forums, such as the \nGlobal  Partnership  for  Effective  Development  Co-operation14 and  the  Effective  Institutions \nPlatform,15 and in the continued focus on expanding the use of country systems for delivering \ndevelopment assistance. \n \n8.  Approaches to tackle governance and capacity issues continue to evolve in recognition \nthat this area is particularly challenging. There is a focus on effective or performing institutions \nas the outcome of governance and capacity development. Greater attention is paid to the \ncontext in which institutions operate, and to the change readiness of stakeholders. Development \nagencies are increasingly looking to augment training and technical advisory services with \nknowledge sharing, peer exchanges between countries, innovative solutions, and collaborative \npractices involving nongovernment actors. Policy- and results-based operations and use of \ncountry systems continue to be important for strengthening institutional performance. \n \n9.  Strategic development partnerships in the region, including emerging ones, should be \nstrengthened.  The  longstanding  ADB/Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and \nDevelopment (OECD) Anticorruption Initiative for Asia and the Pacific combines the expertise of \nADB and OECD to support 31 member countries and jurisdictions to fight corruption.16 The \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2013.

The TA will build on ADB\u2019s TA for Governance and Capacity Development Initiative \n(Phase 2) and TA for Support for Implementation of the Second Governance and Anticorruption \nAction Plan, due for completion in 2015.18 Through these TA projects, ADB has supported the \nimplementation of ADB\u2019s governance and capacity development strategies with DMCs since \n2008. The TA projects have combined financing of $6,313,000. Part of this financing was \nprovided by the Governance Cooperation Fund (GCF), which is also due to end in 2015.19 \nPreliminary findings from the review of the GCF under way show an overall positive contribution \nto the incorporation of governance considerations in the CPSs of DMCs.20 \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact will be for participating DMCs to respond more effectively to governance and \ncapacity challenges in the sectors and subsectors where ADB is active. The outcome will be \ngovernance and capacity development better mainstreamed in ADB country programming and \noperations. \n  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA meets demand from DMCs for technical support and knowledge in governance \nand capacity development that responds to their needs and addresses key institutional issues \naffecting the quality and success of ADB operations. The TA will support the preparation and \nimplementation of CPSs and sector road maps through better analytics, innovative knowledge \nsolutions, collaborative practices, and strengthened regional partnerships. \n \n13.  Output  1:  Governance  risk  assessments  that  inform  country  partnership \nstrategies, sector assessments and road maps, and operations prepared. The TA will \nsupport DMCs to identify and address governance risks at the country and sector levels in \naccordance with the revised guidance for implementing GACAP II.21 At least eight GRAs will be \nsupported, informing about 40% of CPSs that are expected to be prepared during the TA.22 The \nTA will prioritize country teams that do not have sufficient in-house governance expertise to \nsupport DMCs in this area. The emphasis will be on improving analysis of governance and \ninstitutions, including carrying out sector institutional analysis, and assessing country systems \nfor PFM and procurement to enable ADB\u2019s shift toward the use of country systems, supporting \ndialogue with DMCs, and improving operational risk assessment and risk management plans. \n                                                 \n17 Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Indonesia, Mongolia, and the Philippines are current members of the OGP. \n18 ADB. 2009.

Output 2: Knowledge products and partnerships that bring greater attention to \ngovernance and capacity issues developed. The TA will prepare an inaugural Southeast \nAsia government at a glance report jointly with the OECD.23 The report will compare public \nsector information and include a special policy chapter of interest to selected DMCs.24 The \ncountries the report will aim to cover are Cambodia, Indonesia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam. The country \ncoverage might be expanded in successive reports. On-demand knowledge products will also \nbe produced based on DMC demand and what is required by sector operations. The products \nwill include how-to guidance notes on specific areas of governance and capacity development, \nincluding at sector and subsector levels, and governance case briefs of good practices in sector \noperations that contribute to enhanced governance and institutional performance. \n \n15.  Output 3: Governance and capacity development in operations for selected DMCs \nfurther integrated. The TA will support long-term national governance experts placed in at \nleast five ADB resident missions selected on the basis of attention to governance issues in \nCPSs and the resource needs of resident missions. The experts will work closely with DMC \nagencies in strengthening CPSs and ADB\u2019s country portfolio. They will have expertise in PFM, \nprocurement, combating corruption, governance reforms, and/or institutional risk assessment \nand  management.  This  will  enable  ADB  to  provide  on-the-ground  support  for  GRAs  and \ngovernance and capacity development activities, and facilitate dialogue with DMC officials. The \nexperts  will  be  integral  members  of  the  Governance  Thematic  Group  (GovTG)  and  will \ncontribute  to  cross-departmental  knowledge  sharing  and  lesson  learning.  The  TA  will  also \nsupport small-scale knowledge sharing and innovative activities in DMCs that help mitigate \ngovernance  risks,  address  governance  challenges  with  high  institutional  complexity  and \ninnovation,  and  encourage  multistakeholder  approaches  to  governance  and  capacity \ndevelopment  for  better  delivery  of  public  services  (e.g.,  helping  OGP  member  countries \nimplement their action plans or encouraging other DMCs to join the OGP). Complementing \nthese activities, DMC officials will be supported to participate in GovTG\u2019s flagship governance \nand institutional development learning program, which is expected to start in 2016. \n \n16.  Output 4: Implementation of the ADB/OECD Anticorruption Initiative for Asia and \nthe Pacific enhanced. The TA will support implementation of the initiative\u2019s medium-term work \nprogram, which includes annual steering group meetings combined with capacity development \nseminars, a regional anticorruption conference in 2017, a special thematic review on a topic to \nbe  determined  by  the  members,  volunteer  country  reviews,  as  well  as  strengthening \npartnerships  with  international  bodies,  the  private  sector,  and  civil  society.  This  flagship \nanticorruption program supports DMC jurisdictions to fight corruption and implement the United \nNations  Convention  against  Corruption  through  capacity  development,  mutual  support  and \nexchange of expertise, and knowledge products. \n \n17.  No major risks are associated with the TA. Achievement of the outcome and outputs will \ndepend on demand for and ownership of governance and capacity support from DMCs. While \ndemand  is  considered  generally  high  across  DMCs,  selectivity  is  needed  in  support\u2014\nrecognizing that the nature and context of reform and change may, in some situations, limit what \nADB can do in shorter periods. There is also a risk that DMCs do not have sufficient resources \nto implement and sustain the activities and measures initiated by the TA. \n                                                 \n23 The report is included in the memorandum of understanding for strengthening cooperation between ADB and \nOECD signed in 2013.      \n24 The report will be modeled on the Latin America and the Caribbean publication prepared jointly by the OECD and \nthe Inter-American Development Bank. www.oecd.org/gov/govataglance.htm. \n ", "  5\nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,500,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). Demand for support under the \noutputs is expected to exceed TASF financing available, and the TASF will be used to leverage \npossible cofinancing from other sources. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  ADB will be the executing agency of the TA project, which will be implemented from \nJanuary  2016  to  December  2018.  The  GovTG  Secretariat  in  the  Social  Development, \nGovernance and Gender Division of ADB\u2019s Sustainable Development and Climate Change \nDepartment will be responsible for administering TA activities. For outputs 1\u20133, the GovTG \nCommittee will serve as the steering group for TA implementation, monitoring, and reporting.   \nFor output 4, as in the past, ADB and OECD will act as the secretariat of the ADB/OECD \nAnticorruption Initiative.25 \n \n20.  The TA will finance consulting services, studies, reports, and other knowledge products, \nas  well  as  workshops  and  other  knowledge  and  learning  events.  The  TA  will  provide \ninternational consultants (43 person-months) and national consultants (150 person-months) with \nexpertise in governance, public sector management, PFM, procurement, anticorruption, and/or \ncapacity  and  institutional  development,  including  operating  within  and  across  sectors  and \nthemes. The terms of reference for consultants will be further developed when specific activities \nare undertaken. Given the intermittence of the assignments and the variety of skills required, \nconsultants will be recruited individually, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time) and with output-based contracts and lump \nsum out-of-pocket expenses, wherever possible. All disbursements under the TA will be made \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended \nfrom time to time). In the event that ADB staff act as resource persons in the implementation of \nthe TA, travel and related costs will be charged to the TA. However, their salaries and benefits \nwill be charged to ADB\u2019s internal administrative expenses budget. \n \n21.  The  TA  will  benefit  from  the  expertise  available  within  OECD  and  from  its  proven \nmethodologies. OECD will contribute staff resources to support implementation of relevant TA \nactivities and OECD\u2019s global survey tools will be used to prepare the government at a glance \npublication.      \n \n22.  The TA will be monitored through regular consultations with relevant ADB and DMC \nstakeholders. Regular reporting of accomplishments will be made to the GovTG Committee. \nGood  practices  and  lessons  will  be  disseminated  through  governance  case  briefs,  other \npublications, and knowledge and learning events. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,500,000 on a grant basis \nfor Enhancing Governance and Capacity Development as Driver of Change, and hereby reports \nthis action to the Board. \n                                                 \n25 ADB and OECD. 2001.
