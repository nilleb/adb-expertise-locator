It  is  further \nproposed  that  subprogram  1  be  supported  by  a  loan  for \n$300,000,000. \n   \nClassification  Targeting Classification: General intervention \nSector: Finance \nSubsector: Finance sector development \nThemes:  Sustainable  economic  growth,  private  sector \ndevelopment, and governance  \nSubthemes:  Promotion  of  economic  efficiency  and  enabling \nmarkets;  policy,  institutional,  legal,  and  regulatory  reforms; \nfinancial and economic governance. \n   \nEnvironment  Category C \nAssessment \n   \nThe Program  Financial sector reforms are crucial to raising Indonesia\u2019s growth \nRationale  rate and to increasing the economy\u2019s resilience. Since the Asian \nfinancial crisis in 1997, Indonesia has undertaken key financial \nsector reforms and has succeeded in restoring the banking sector \nto  solvency  and  profitability.  However,  the  rate  of  economic \ngrowth  has  not  returned  to  pre-crisis  levels.  Indonesia  needs \ninvestments, especially in infrastructure, but the domestic financial \nsector is not yet able to finance them. The financial sector is \nshallow  and  dominated  by  banks.  Bank  lending  has  not  yet \nrecovered to pre-crisis levels and banks\u2019 balance sheets make \nthem unsuited to the nation\u2019s need for long-term financing. The \nnonbank  financial  sector,  in  particular,  the  capital  markets, \nalthough  still  small,  offer  a  major  opportunity  to  reinvigorate \ngrowth thorough more efficient intermediation. \n \nThe goal of the Capital Market Development Program Cluster is to \npromote the diversification and resilience of the financial sector \nwhile supporting the medium-term macroeconomic goals of the \nGovernment. The Program supports the Government\u2019s financial \nsector reform agenda by focusing on capital markets. Most of its \npolicy outcomes will be in line with the Government\u2019s financial \nsector policy package (FSPP) and its capital market master plan, \n2005\u20132009 (CMMP). \n \nThe Program aims to strengthen transparency and information \ndisclosure. This is essential to build confidence in capital markets \nand  institutions,  facilitate  regulatory  oversight,  and,  in  turn,  to \npromote price discovery and market liquidity. Both supply and \n ", "ii   \ndemand  sides  of  financial  markets  will  be  addressed.  On  the \nsupply side, measures are proposed to deepen government bond \nmarkets,  which  are  an  essential  building  block  for  the \ndevelopment of corporate bond markets and inter-bank money \nmarkets. On the demand side, the investor base needs to be \nbroadened by promoting institutional investors such as contractual \nsavings and collective investment schemes.  The Program aims to \nstrengthen  the  underlying  structure  for  securities  trading,  so \nmarkets  can  function  with  sufficient  speed,  efficiency  and \naccountability.  Deeper  domestic  capital  markets  and  improved \nfinancial intermediation between savers and investors, supported \nby stronger regulation and supervision will increase the financial \nsector\u2019s  contribution  to  economic  growth.  Policy  measures  to \nimprove  financial  governance  and  market  efficiency,  and  to \nreduce systemic risks, are embedded in the Program and will help \nto strengthen investor confidence and the investment climate.  \n \nThe  reform  agenda  is  structured  around  the  following  policy \noutcomes,  which  form  the  basis  of  the  Program\u2019s  four \ncomponents:  \n \n(i)  enhancing  information  disclosure  and  price \ndiscovery; \n(ii)  promoting deeper and more liquid financial \nmarkets; \n(iii)  improving market surveillance and investor \nprotection; and \n(iv)  strengthening governance and human resource \ncapacity. \n \nThe  Program  will  consist  of  two  single-tranche  subprograms \nanchored on the Government\u2019s financial sector reform programs. \nIt will run from January 2006 to December 2010, with a single \ntranche loan of $300 million to be disbursed under subprogram 1 \n(2006\u20132007). Subprogram 2 is expected to be ready for Board \napproval about 18 months after subprogram 1 becomes effective. \nThe policy actions have been divided into two phases: January \n2006 to September 2007 for subprogram 1 (recognizing measures \nalready taken by the Government), and October 2007 to June \n2009 for subprogram 2. The Government\u2019s medium-term reform \nagenda and its timing will be reviewed in light of the achievements \nof subprogram 1 and reform proposals for the policy environment \nmay be modified if necessary, supported by subprogram 2. The \nGovernment envisages support from ADB of $200 million to $300 \nmillion for subprogram 2.  \n \nImpact and Outcome  The expected impact of the Program is capital market growth and \ndiversification, combined with stronger regulatory and supervisory \ncapacity. It is expected that the Program will lead to an increase in \nthe nonbank financial sector\u2019s share of total financial assets. The \nreforms, which concentrate on improving information disclosure \n ", "  iii  \nand enhancing market surveillance, will provide more protection \nfor investors. To provide a basis for consolidated regulation of the \nnonbank  financial  sector  and  to  move  toward  more  functional \nregulation, oversight of the capital markets was recently combined \nwith oversight of the contractual savings industries on which they \ndepend, principally insurance and pensions. This will be achieved \nthrough the recently merged Bapepam-LK (the capital market and \nnonbank financial supervisory authority) and is expected to be \nformalized under a regulatory framework now being developed. A \nnew  risk-based  approach  to  supervision,  which  originated  in \nbanking  and  has  already  been  applied  to  some  securities \nintermediaries, will be applied to contractual savings institutions \nand  other  capital  market  institutions,  thus  reducing  the  risk  of \nregulatory arbitrage. \n \nThe Program Loan  A loan of $300,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will \nFinancing Plan  be provided under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased  lending  facility  for  subprogram  1.  The  loan  will  have  a \n15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years, an interest rate \ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending \nfacility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75%  per  annum,  and  such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. \n \nPeriod and Tranching  The program period is from January 2006 to December 2010, with \n  a  single  tranche  loan  of  $300  million  to  be  disbursed  under \nsubprogram  1.  Subprogram  2  will  be  submitted  for  Board \nconsideration  about  18  months  after  subprogram  1  becomes \neffective, subject to the Government\u2019s readiness to undertake the \nreform agenda.  \n \nCounterpart Funds  The Government will use the local currency counterpart funds \n  generated by the loan proceeds to meet program expenditures \nand associated costs of reform and additional budgetary allocation \nfor development spending. \n \nExecuting Agency  Bapepam-LK \n   \nImplementation  Bapepam-LK will be the Executing Agency for the Program and \nArrangements  will monitor and facilitate the implementation of the agreed reform \nactions to ensure that they are carried out in a timely manner. \nDMO  and  the  Directorate  of  Taxes  (DOT),  both  under  MOF, \nBapepeam-LK, Menneg BUMN (the State Ministry of State Owned \nEnterprises), and the Financial System Stability Forum will be the \nimplementing agencies. Bapepam-LK has established a program \ncoordination committee headed by the Bapepam-LK chair with \nrepresentatives  from  DMO,  DOT,  Menneg  BUMN,  Bappenas \n(National  Development  Planning  Agency),  and  the  Financial \nSystem  Stability  Forum.  The  committee  is  responsible  for \ncoordinating the implementation and sustaining of the program \nactions. The committee shall oversee the implementation of the \npolicy actions detailed in the Policy Letter and the Policy Matrix, \n ", "iv   \nand provide guidance and direction to the Executing Agency, the \nImplementing Agencies and other relevant line agencies of the \nBorrower. ADB may be invited to participate in the meetings as an \nobserver. \n \nProcurement  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign \nexchange  costs  (excluding  local  duties  and  taxes)  of  items \nproduced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries  (other  than \nitems specified in the list of ineligible items and imports financed \nby other bilateral and multilateral sources). The Government will \ncertify  its  compliance  with  this  formula  with  each  withdrawal \nrequest.  Otherwise,  import  documentation  under  existing \nprocedures will be required. ADB reserves the right to audit the \nuse  of  the  loan  proceeds  and  to  verify  the  accuracy  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s certification.  \n \nProgram Benefits and  The Program supports the Government\u2019s agenda to establish the \nBeneficiaries   Indonesian capital market as a resilient and competitive market \nthat  supports  higher  growth  for  the  national  economy.  It  will \nprovide  a  policy  framework  that  encourages  new  financial \ninstruments and tenors, and new kinds of intermediation. It will \nenhance information disclosure and facilitate price discovery, thus \nimproving the efficiency with which financial markets price risk.  \nThis will help to create deeper and more liquid capital markets. It \nwill also promote stronger intermediaries that are better able to \nmobilize  and  allocate  resources  and  risks.  Better  market \nsurveillance  and  investor  protection  are  essential  for  capital \nmarket development. Together with the broader economic reforms \nbeing undertaken in Indonesia, the development of the capital \nmarkets  will  contribute  to  productivity  growth,  employment \ngeneration, and financial sector stability. \n \nRisks and Assumptions  While mitigation measures have been put in place for some of the \nkey risks anticipated for program implementation, subprogram 1 \nstill faces some risks.  \n \nSustaining Reforms. The financial and operational autonomy of \nBapepam-LK,  which  is  critical  for  effective  supervision  of  the \nnonbank  financial  sector,  will  need  to  be  supported  by  an \nappropriate regulatory framework. Reforms being undertaken by \nthe  Government  may  be  opposed  by  vested  or  competing \ninterests. The public and parliament will need to be persuaded of \nthe longer-term benefits of reforms that have upfront costs. The \nconsolidation  of  reform  initiatives  in  recent  years  and  the \ncommitment to further reforms by the Government and a strong \nparliamentary coalition should ensure Indonesia is on the path to \ngrowth and poverty reduction.  \n \nGovernance and Capacity Constraints. Institutional and human \nresource weaknesses within Bapepam-LK may lead to delays in \nimplementing reforms. To address this, technical assistance (TA) \n ", "  v  \nwill  be  provided  under  the  Program  to  help  address  capacity \nbuilding. Further, the Government has agreed to commit, through \nits normal budgetary processes, appropriate provisions for human \nresources development to sustain capacity building efforts over \nthe medium to long term. ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program \n(2006-2009)  envisages  enhancing  governance  and  reducing \nopportunities for corruption through its lending and TA operations. \nADB has provided support for anticorruption measures, including \nprocurement  reforms,  during  the  last  7  years.  A  number  of \nongoing  loan-funded  activities  have  an  anticorruption  and \ncapacity-building  focus.  ADB  has  also  actively  supported  the \nPartnership for Governance Reform -a cooperative relationship \nbetween  the  Indonesian  Government,  civil  society,  the  private \nsector  and  Indonesia\u2019s  international  development  partners  on \ngovernance reform. The Financial System Stability Forum, which \nbegan  operations  in  June  2007,  will  provide  a  platform  for \nexchanging information and ideas, and will help to coordinate the \nregulatory and supervisory activities of Bank Indonesia, Bapepam-\nLK,  and  the  Lembaga  Penjamin  Simpanan  (Deposit  Insurance \nInstitution).  Successful  implementation  of  the  CMMP  with  the \nsupport  of  the  Program  should  strengthen  the  capacity  and \nauthority  of  Bapepam-LK  in  regulating  and  ensuring  good \ngovernance in the nonbank financial market. \n \nLack  of  Commitment  and  Accountability.  Lack  of \naccountability, measurable outcomes, industry commitment, and \ntactical  planning  may  mean  that  the  CMMP  runs  into \nimplementation difficulties. There are differences of view among \nstakeholders that will need to be resolved if policy reforms are to \nprogress. However, progress is likely at present in view of the \nstrong Government commitment to reform. The reform program is \nmade more tractable by a phased plan for the implementation of \nwell defined measures over the next 4 years, in line with the \nGovernment\u2019s  CMMP  as  well  as  its  financial  sector  policy \npackage. In addition, the establishment of an internal compliance \nbureau  in  December  2006  and  a  revised  code  of  ethics  will \nstrengthen governance and accountability within Bapepam-LK. \n  \nEnforcement  Constraints. Bapepam-LK may have difficulty in \naddressing its compliance and enforcement mandate effectively. \nThe Program focuses on strengthening its investigation strategies \nand enforcement skills through a clearly defined capacity building \nprogram within Bapepam-LK.  \n  \nExogenous  Shocks.  Exogenous  shocks  to  the  economy  that \nadversely affect growth prospects and threaten macroeconomic \nstability are a risk to achieving program outcomes. There is also a \nrisk of a slowdown in the global economy and of a disorderly \nunwinding  of  global  macroeconomic  imbalances.  However, \noverall, the economy\u2019s vulnerability to external shocks has been \ndecreasing, primarily because of sound debt and macroeconomic \n ", "vi   \nmanagement. Indonesia\u2019s ratio of total external debt to GDP fell \nfrom  49.3%  in  2005  to  under  37%  in  2006.  The  Program,  in \nconjunction with additional reform programs financed by ADB and \nthe Development Policy Support Program financed by the World \nBank  and  the  Government  of  Japan  will  help  to  sustain  the \neconomy\u2019s  growth  path  while  reducing  the  risks  of \nmacroeconomic instability. \n \nTechnical Assistance  TA will be provided and implemented at the same time as the \nProgram. The TA is estimated to cost $1,500,000 equivalent. ADB \nis administering a portion of the TA not exceeding the equivalent \nof $500,000 to be financed on a grant basis by the Financial \nSector  Development  Partnership  Fund  (established  by  the \nGovernment of Luxembourg). In addition, ADB will provide the \nequivalent of $700,000 on a grant basis to be funded from the \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund. The Government will provide \nthe remaining $300,000 equivalent by providing counterpart staff \nand  other  support  facilities.  The  objective  of  the  TA  is  to \ncomplement the efforts to be undertaken by Bapepam-LK and the \nGovernment  to  build  up  capacity  within  Bapepam-LK  and  the \ncapital market industry. The TA will support capacity building in \nfive main areas: \n \n(i)  developing database and basic applied research skills \nin Bapepam-LK\u2019s newly established research bureau; \n(ii)  carrying out  on-the-job training for Bapepam-LK staff \nthrough  secondments  with  regulators  in  other \njurisdictions;  \n(iii)  improving the market surveillance and regulatory skills \nof Bapepam-LK staff through short courses by local \ntraining  institutions  in  collaboration  with  outside \nexperts; \n(iv)  developing curricula for training programs, as well as \nstandards  for  certification  for  professionals  in  fields \nrelated  to  capital  markets  (e.g.  general  insurance \nactuaries  and surveillance training for SRO staff); and \n(v)  developing an econometric model and related capacity \nto allow for a better understanding of vulnerabilities in \nthe nonbank financial sector by the Financial System \nStability Forum.  \n ", "       \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogram cluster to the Republic of Indonesia for the Capital Market Development Program \nCluster comprising two subprograms, and (ii) a proposed loan for subprogram 1. The report also \ndescribes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  strengthening  regulation  and  governance \nincluding the administration of a grant from the Financial Sector Development Partnership Fund \n(FSDPF) and, if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated \nto me by the Board, will approve the TA and the administration of the FSDPF grant. The \nprogram design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n \n2.  Economic  Growth.  Indonesia\u2019s  strengthening  macroeconomic  performance  was \nreflected in a rising but still modest growth rate of 5.5% in 2006. This is faster than the average \ngrowth over the previous 3 years but still below the growth rates before the 1997 Asian financial \ncrisis. A key constraint on higher growth is the investment rate, which, while showing signs of \nimprovement, remains sluggish. Fixed investment grew by just 2.9% in 2006, far below rates \nachieved in 2004 and 2005, although it perked up in the fourth quarter when inflation and \ninterest rates eased. Weak bank intermediation was another factor limiting investments and the \ngrowth potential.  \n \n3.  Weak Investment Climate. Lack of investment stems not only from higher borrowing \ncosts but also from continuing deficiencies in the business environment.  Realized foreign direct \ninvestment and domestic investment both fell by a third in 2006, foreign direct investment to $6 \nbillion and domestic investment to $2.2 billion. On the other hand, Investment approvals rose, \nindicating that investment could turn up soon. As a percentage of gross domestic product \n(GDP), gross fixed capital formation in Indonesia in 2006 was 24%, up slightly from 2005. That \nwas below rates recorded for Viet Nam (33.1% in 2005) and Thailand (28.6%), but above \nMalaysia (20.2%) and the Philippines (14.2%).    \n \n4.  Signs of Confidence. Inflation eased from above 17% in January 2006 to about 6.6% \nlate  in  the  year  as  the  impact  of  the  2005  boost  in  fuel  prices  faded.  The  Government \nimplemented bold fuel price adjustments in 2005 by reducing domestic fuel subsidies, thereby \nreducing the budget deficit by $4.5 billion for that year. The remaining domestic fuel subsidies \nare expected to be phased out, although no schedule has been provided. Citing improvements \nin  the  country\u2019s  fiscal  management  and  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  deal  with  corruption, \ninternational rating agencies Moody\u2019s and Fitch raised Indonesia\u2019s ratings outlook in early 2007 \nto positive from stable, though the B1 (Moody\u2019s) and BB- (Fitch) sovereign rating has yet to \nreach  investment  grade,  as  it  was  before  the  crisis.  The  Government  issued $2  billion  in \ninternational bonds in 2006 and $1.5 billion in February 2007, bringing the total outstanding \ninternational bonds to $7 billion. Option-adjusted spreads on sovereign bonds maturing in 2014 \nnarrowed to 157 basis points in late 2006 from 212 basis points early in the year. The stock \nmarket index soared by 55% over the year, with market capitalization rising to the equivalent of \n37.4% of GDP from 30.0% in 2005. Foreign portfolio equity investment grew by almost 10 times \nto about $2 billion. \n \n5.  Reduced External Vulnerability. The current account surplus rose to $9.9 billion in \n2006, or 2.7% of GDP. Foreign reserves reached $42.6 billion, equivalent to about 4.5 months \nof import cover and official debt repayment. Its strong external position enabled Indonesia to \nprepay its remaining $7.8 billion debt to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Overall, the \n ", "2   \neconomy\u2019s vulnerability to external shocks has been decreasing, primarily because of sound \ndebt management. The ratio of total external debt to GDP has also declined steadily since the \ncrisis, from over 150% of GDP in 1998 to just under 37% in 2006. The debt-service ratio rose to \nabove 24.8% in 2006 from 15.5% in 2005, primarily because of the early repayment of IMF debt \nand the end of a postponement on debt servicing by the Paris Club to help the country handle \nits December 2004 earthquake and tsunami disaster. Public debt was reduced to 41% of GDP. \nThe Government worked to contain its fiscal deficit and to redirect public expenditures toward \ndevelopment and social goals. The realized fiscal deficit in 2006 was 0.9% of GDP. In 2005, the \ndeficit was 0.5%, mainly because new budgetary procedures delayed the release of funds that \nyear. Portfolio investment has been strong; partly a result of the surge in global liquidity, but \ndirect, long-term investment is tepid. Financial markets continue to experience bouts of volatility, \ninfluenced by global developments and policy delays, and aggravated by the shallowness of the \ndomestic market. \n \nTable 1: Main Economic Indicators of Indonesia \n \nItem  1999  2000  2001  2002  2003  2004  2005  2006 \nGDP  1,215.1    1,389.77   1,646.32   1,821.83   2,013.67  2,295.83  2,784.96  3,338.20 \ncurrent     \nprices (Rp   \ntrillion) \nGDP  0.8  4.9  3.64  4.50  4.78  5.03  5.7  5.48 \ngrowth \n(%) \nInflation  1.9  9.3  12.6  10.0  5.1  6.4  17.1  6.6 \n(%) \nBI Rate  12.5  14.5  17.6  12.9  8.3  7.4  12.8  9.75 \n(%) \nNet FDI  (1.9)  (4.6)  (3.0)  0.1  (0.6)  (1.5)  2.2  2.9 \n($ billion)   \nRp/$ (end  7,630  9,595  10,400  8,940  8,465  9,290  9,840  9,020 \nof period)     \nRp/$  7,842  8,379  10,233  9,317  8,562  8,926  9,706  9,164 \n(average \nof period) \nBI = Bank Indonesia, FDI = foreign direct investment, GDP = gross domestic product \nSource: Government of Indonesia. \n \nTable 2: GDP Growth in Selected Asian Economies (%) \n \nEconomy  2006  2007  2008 \nDeveloping Asia  9.4  8.8  8.4 \nChina, People\u2019s Republic of  10.7  10.0  9.5 \nIndonesia  5.5  6.3  6.8 \nMalaysia  5.9  5.5  5.8 \nPhilippines  5.4  5.8  5.8 \nThailand  5.0  4.5  4.8 \nViet Nam  8.2  8.0  7.8 \nSource: International Monetary Fund. 2007.

Indonesia  has  taken  important  steps  to  intensify  its \nstructural reform agenda, enhance the investment climate, improve public infrastructure, and \nstrengthen  financial  sector  intermediation.  A  time-bound  investment  policy  package  was \nintroduced  in  February  2006  and  an  Investment  Law  was  passed  in  March  2007.  An \ninfrastructure reform package was adopted in 2006 in support of the investment policy package. \n ", "    3 \nHowever,  important  and  difficult  issues  related  to  tax  and  labor  markets  remain  under \ndiscussion. \n \n7.  The Medium-Term Development Plan. The medium-term national development plan, \n2004\u201320091 provides a clear set of targets that the Government wants to achieve by the end of \nthe period. Among them are sustained growth of more than 6%, job creation to absorb 1.5 \nmillion new entrants into the labor market annually, achievement of Millennium Development \nGoal targets, and a reduction in the stock of debt to 31.8% of GDP. An investment climate \nsurvey conducted in December 20052 highlighted the cost of financing as one of the main \nconstraints on establishing a conducive investment climate. The medium-term development \nplan sets out a good policy framework for the reforms and investments needed for each sector. \nPolicies envisaged under the Government\u2019s medium-term macroeconomic framework should \nhelp  mitigate  economic  vulnerabilities,  improve  the  business  climate,  and  encourage \ninvestment. An optimistic scenario for the next 5 years is that pending laws and regulations are \nenacted,  encouraging  private  sector  development  and  accelerating  GDP  growth  to  7\u22128%. \nAlternatively, if the country falters in its implementation of policies and fails to unblock funding \nconstraints at the regional level, growth will probably remain below 6%.  \n \n8.  Key constraints on accelerating GDP growth include an absence of: (i) a stable and \nconsistent legal and regulatory environment, (ii) well-developed capital markets and nonbank \nfinancial sector, and (iii) adequate skills and institutional capacity within public and market \ninstitutions. In particular, the 1997 crisis raised awareness of the risks associated with a growth-\noriented development agenda without a deep and diverse financial sector. Indonesia\u2019s banking \nsector has rebounded from the crisis with nonperforming loans (NPLs) reduced and profitability \nand solvency restored. However, bank intermediation is declining, and banks\u2019 reliance on short- \nterm deposits makes them ill suited to provide the long-term funds needed for a sustained \nexpansion of investment. The financial system is still bank-dominated, although increasing \nattention is being paid to the nonbank financial sector. An action plan for the nonbank financial \nsector was approved by the Government in November 2004 in consultation with ADB. The \naction plan included measures to support and implement the Government\u2019s capital market \nmaster plan, 2005\u20132009 (CMMP). The CMMP is principally focused on strengthening capital \nmarkets by improving surveillance, increasing legal certainty, strengthening the role and quality \nof market players, expanding products, and developing Islamic financial products.    \n \n9.  Financial Sector Reforms. Underscoring the priority accorded to achieving a deep and \ndiverse financial sector, a financial sector policy package (FSPP) was introduced in June 2006. \nThis aims to improve policy coordination and to advance the regulation and supervision of both \nbanks  and  nonbank  financial  institutions.  The  FSPP  is  an  annual  exercise  which  reviews \nprogress in a broad set of sectors targeted for reforms, while identifying and setting targets for \nadditional sectors. The Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs, Bank Indonesia, Ministry of \nFinance (MOF), and Ministry of State-Owned Enterprises are signatories to the joint decree for \nimplementing the FSPP. The FSPP complements the CMMP as well as Bank Indonesia\u2019s vision \nof Indonesia\u2019s financial architecture. The Government has signaled its commitment to continuity \nof reforms in this area through the release of another FSSP in 2007.  \n \n10.  ADB provided significant inputs to the preparation of the above two financial sector \npolicy packages. It has also been involved in the Government\u2019s reform process through policy \n                                                 \n1 Presidential Regulation 7/2005 on the Medium-Term National Development Plan issued on 19 January 2005. \n2 World Bank Business Survey. 2005. \n ", "4   \ndialogue and technical assistance (TA).3 The TA has provided support to implement the main \nelements of the action plan and the CMMP.

Other  Supporting  Programs. ADB is also involved in a series of program lending \noperations in conjunction with the World Bank\u2019s development policy loans. These will support \nthe Government\u2019s broad-based, cross-cutting, medium-term investment climate and governance \nreform agenda. The first development policy loan was approved by the World Bank in 2004. In \nthat year, ADB provided parallel support through financial sector and state-owned enterprise \n(SOE) reform programs. In 2005, at the Government\u2019s request, ADB approved the Development \nPolicy Support Program I (DPSP I).5 The second DPSP was approved in 2006.6 The DPSP \nseries is embedded in the Government\u2019s medium-term national development plan for 2004\u2013\n2009. It supports the broad goal of the plan to stimulate high and sustainable economic growth \n(7% average annual growth by 2009 from about 4% before 2004) and halve poverty incidence \n(from 16.6% in 2004 to 8.2% by 2009). \n \n12.  ADB\u2019s  Country  Strategy  and  Program  (CSP).7 Financial  sector  deepening  that \nfacilitates domestic resource mobilization was identified as one of the five key areas for ADB \nintervention  under  the  CSP  for  2006\u20132009.  The  CSP  recommends  using  a  single-tranche \ncluster approach for program loans to support the Government\u2019s medium-term reform agenda. \nThe CSP also envisages technical assistance in support of these loans.  \n \n13.  The proposed Program cluster evolves from the Government\u2019s medium-term national \ndevelopment plan to support its financial sector reform agenda in line with the CSP, with a \nprincipal focus on development of capital markets in Indonesia (Figure 1).  \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2002.

Indonesia\u2019s  financial  sector  has  stabilized  but  continues  to  exhibit \nstructural vulnerabilities and risks. At an M2-to-GDP ratio of 47% at the end of 2006,8 Indonesia \nlags behind regional competitors such as Malaysia and Thailand, which have ratios of more \nthan 100%. Indonesia has also performed poorly in relation to its neighbors in terms of the \nbreadth of its financial markets. The market capitalization of Asian equities has trebled since \n1997 and capitalization as a percentage of GDP in Southeast Asian economies such as Hong \nKong, China; Malaysia; and Singapore compares favorably with that in Germany, the United \nKingdom, and the United States. In terms of market value to GDP, despite increasing from \n14.5% in 2002 to 37.4% in 2006, Indonesia\u2019s equity market remains one of the smallest in the \nAsia and Pacific region. A more detailed sector analysis is provided in Appendix 2. \n \n15.  High Concentration of Banking Institutions. Banks account for about 80% of financial \nsector assets.9 Despite its size and recent improvements, the Indonesian banking sector is not a \nsource of long-term capital as more than 90% of bank deposits have a maturity of less than 1 \nmonth. As a reaction to the 1997 crisis, bankers in general are risk averse in their approach to \nlending. Banks are reluctant to lend because many large companies are already highly indebted \nand they prefer to keep their funds in risk-free government bonds. As a result, loan levels have \nstayed below deposit levels, making banks very liquid. Much of this liquidity has been invested \nin short-term Bank Indonesia certificates, which have ballooned to a high of Rp190 trillion. \n \n16.  Better  Risk  Management in  the Banking  Industry. Since the NPL ratio of banks \npeaked at 48% in 1998, the asset quality of commercial banks has recovered. The gross NPL \nratio for the banking industry fell from 7.6% in 2005 to 7% in 2006. The NPL ratio of 15 of the \nlarger banks fell from 10.6% in 2005 to 8.4% in 2006, while those of the other banks are in the \nrange of 3\u20134%. The Government has recently issued regulations providing more flexibility for \nstate banks to write off their bad loans, so NPLs for state banks should decline in future. \nStronger corporate balance sheets, including less reliance on external financing, have also \nreduced risks. The average capital adequacy ratio at about 20% in the banking industry is well \nabove  the  prescribed  prudential  norm.  Bank  Indonesia\u2019s  vision  of  Indonesia\u2019s  financial \narchitecture envisages consolidation in the banking industry through a reduction in the number \nof commercial banks from 130 to 80. Banking risk is moderate and controllable because of high \ncapital adequacy ratios, improvements in the payment system, the introduction of a financial \nsector  safety  net,  better  risk  management  practices,  and  stronger  corporate  governance. \nIndonesia\u2019s improvements to risk management are in line with the implementation of Basel II10 \nplanned for 2008.  \n \n17.  Undeveloped  Nonbank  Financial  Subsector. The nonbank financial subsector still \naccounts for only 20% of total financial assets. The sector includes mutual funds (also known as \ninvestment companies), insurance companies, pension funds, securities brokers and dealers, \npawnshops, rural institutions, and venture capital companies. In 2005, the nonbank financial \nsector accounted for Rp375 trillion in assets (13.7% of GDP). Pension funds and insurance \nfirms account for about half of these assets. \n                                                 \n8  The M2-to-GDP ratio (that is demand, savings, and time deposits or M2, divided by the output of goods and \nservices, namely GDP) is a common measure of financial depth. \n9  Appendix 2, Table A2.3. \n10 Recommendations on banking laws and regulations issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. \n ", "    7 \n18.  Need for Stronger Governance and Regulatory Regime. Financial sector regulation \nand supervision are under the authority of two main supervisory authorities. Banks are regulated \nand supervised by Bank Indonesia, the central bank, which in the aftermath of 1997 has \nundergone significant strengthening and has been given financial and operational autonomy. \nThe Capital Markets Supervisory Agency (Bapepam), established in 1976 under Presidential \nDecree No. 52/1976, has weaker powers and capacity. It is responsible for the regulation and \nday-to-day supervision of capital markets in Indonesia and reports to the MOF. The MOF is \nresponsible for high-level policy matters and Bapepam has some autonomy in relation to the \nconduct of investigations, inspections, and other regulatory functions.  \n \n19.  In 1999, parliament passed a Banking Law to insulate the regulatory and supervisory \nframework  from  political  interference.  The  legislation  required  the  establishment  of  a \nconsolidated  supervisory  authority  for  financial  services,  referred  to  as  the  Consolidated \nSupervisory Authority for Financial Services (OJK) by the end of 2002,to be able to cope better \n \nwith financial conglomeration and innovation and to lower the cost of regulation by making \nefficient use of scarce resources.  \n \n20.  However, prudential regulation of banks focusing on their safety and soundness and \nsystemic risk is fundamentally different from the investor protection needs of securities or capital \nmarkets,  which  are  focused  on  disclosure,  fairness,  and  prevention  of  fraud  through \nenforcement of business rules and punishment of offenders. As became evident following 1999, \nmerging the two different approaches and cultures poses significant challenges, not least of \nwhich is the need to manage the risks of a decline in the quality of supervision during the \ntransition phase. This challenge is made more complex in Indonesia where the two entities to be \nmerged  differed  sharply  in  capacity  and  where  systemic  risks  remain  a  key  concern. \nRecognizing these risks, parliament amended the Banking Law in December 2003, thereby \npostponing the establishment of the OJK from 2002 to 2010. In the meantime, MOF prepared \nan action plan to improve the regulation and supervision of the nonbank financial sector in 2004. \nThe insurance, pension, finance, and venture capital companies were to be regulated by the \nDirectorate General of Financial Institutions (DGFI) in the MOF until 2005, when a presidential \ndecree merging Bapepam and DGFI was issued. MOF merged Bapepam and the DGFI into \nBapepam-LK as the sole regulatory and supervisory authority for the nonbank financial sector. \nThe merger and the endorsement of a plan for improvements in the regulatory and supervisory \nstructure  of  the  newly  created  Bapepam-LK  were  significant  steps  toward  strengthening \nsupervision of nonbank financial services, including the capital markets. A senior (echelon 1)11 \nofficial has been appointed to head the merged entity, paving the way for a consolidation of \nnonbank financial institution supervision. Bapepam-LK is working to improve the operation of \nthe merged regulators and to increase the capacity of its staff. Both the Australian Agency for \nInternational Development (AusAID) and ADB are supporting this transformation and providing \ntraining and human resource development assistance to Bapepam-LK. The Minister of Finance \nsupports further strengthening of Bapepam-LK\u2019s financial and operational autonomy.  \n \n21.  Shallow Equity Market. Indonesia\u2019s equity market has improved steadily since 2002 \nand was among the best performers in the region in 2004 and 2005. In 2006, it was among the \ntop three bourses in the world with a growth of about 50% in market capitalization. However, the \nIndonesian capital market is the second smallest capital market in Southeast Asia (only the \nPhilippines is smaller). In terms of market value to GDP, despite increasing from 14.5% in 2002 \n                                                 \n11  All structural positions in Indonesia\u2019s national civil service are grouped into echelons, with echelon 1 being the most \nsenior. \n ", "8   \nto 37.4% in 2006, Indonesia\u2019s equity market remains one of the smallest in the Asia and Pacific \nregion. The number of companies listed gradually increased to 344 at the end of 2006, but this \nis still low by regional standards (Malaysia had 1,025 listed domestic companies at the end of \n2006;  Taipei,China  693;  Thailand  518;  and  the  Philippines  241).  Although  the  number  of \ncompanies involved is small, both the volume and value of shares traded in Indonesia and \nmarket capitalization as a share of GDP have increased significantly since 2002.  \n \n22.  Promising  Fixed  Income  Market.  Although  the  capital  market  remains  small  and \nilliquid, Indonesia has issued significant volumes of government bonds. These dominate the \nmarket, there had been 56 issues by the end of 2006 with a market value of Rp419 trillion. The \ncorporate bond market by comparison had seen 236 issues at end-2006 with a market value of \nRp62 trillion. Government bonds represent about 13.3% of GDP (end-2006) and corporate \nbonds  about  1.9%\u2014low  by  the  standards  of  neighboring  countries.  Government  bonds \ncomprise a mix of floating and fixed rate bonds\u2014the recent preference of Bank Indonesia being \nfor fixed rate bonds. Bank Indonesia has followed a strategy of consolidating bond issues\u2014\nthrough  buy-backs  and  asset  swaps\u2014and  has  sought  to  build  benchmark  issues.  Current \nmaturities go out to 20 years\u2014a considerable extension of maturity since 2000. The Debt \nManagement Office (DMO) issued its first treasury bills in June 2007 with a 12-month tenor. \nBanks hold about three quarters of government bonds by value. Retail investors are largely \nabsent. A system of primary dealers was introduced in December 2006 and these dealers are \nexpected to provide two-way quotes. In the secondary market, an over-the-counter market and \nthe exchange market co-exist, both offering avenues for trading of all debt securities.  \n \n23.  Issues of Governance and Capitalization in Contractual Savings. The insurance \nindustry is small in terms of the ratio of premiums to GDP (1.8\u20132% for life insurance and 0.62% \nfor general insurance). It is also characterized by a large number of companies and a relatively \nlow level of capitalization. Insurance companies currently invest an estimated 25% of their \nassets  in  short-term  deposits.  The  Government  has  introduced  some  important  regulatory \nchanges  governing  insurers  since  the  Asian  financial  crisis,  including  a  new  risk-weighted \ncapital adequacy regime to encourage mergers and an increase in the capital requirements for \nnew insurance companies. Existing insurance firms have been allowed a grace period to meet \nthese requirements.  \n \n24.  The  pension  sector  is  still  small  and  characterized  by  low  coverage  and  limited \ncapitalization.  Four  main  types  of  funds  dominate  the  pension  sector.  Jamsostek  is  a \nmandatory,  publicly-managed  fund  to  which  all  formal  sector  employers  and  employees \ncontribute. Taspen is a publicly-managed pension fund for civil servants. There are two types of \nprivately-managed funds\u2014employer pension funds and financial institution pension funds\u2014both \nof which are voluntary occupation schemes for private sector employees. These schemes are \npotentially important to pool financial resources and to diversify their investor base, but there are \nlegal  and  regulatory  impediments  to  this.  Bapepam-LK  oversees  the  voluntary  pension \nschemes. In total, the pension industry controls 4.7% of GDP in assets, compared with Thailand \n(8.4%), Malaysia (57%), and Australia (75%). About half of the assets are in public programs, \nand half in private programs.  \n \n25.  Market Infrastructure and Investor Protection. Indonesia\u2019s two principal exchanges, \nthe Jakarta Stock Exchange (JSX) and the Surabaya Stock Exchange (SSX), trade equities, \nbonds, share options and index futures. The SSX focuses on the trading of bonds and futures, \ninstruments that JSX cannot handle. However, the two exchanges compete for listings and \nmany companies are listed on both exchanges. A merger of the two exchanges is included in \nthe CMMP and the 2006 FSPP. In addition, Indonesia has two systems for clearing, settlement, \n ", "    9 \nand deposits: the Indonesian Central Securities Depository (KSEI), and the Indonesian Clearing \nand Guarantee Corporation (KPEI). JSX, SSX, KSEI, and KPEI are self-regulating organizations \nwith the authority to set rules and oversee the activities of broker-dealers and custodian banks \ndealing in securities and bond trading. There are 125 securities broking companies in Indonesia. \nWith regard to rating agencies, Pefindo is Indonesia\u2019s largest and was established in 1994. It is \nan affiliate of Standard and Poor\u2019s and has adapted its rating methodology. The only other \nrating agency is Kasnic Credit Rating Indonesia, incorporated in 1998. Kasnic is affiliated with \nFitch through its shareholder Duff and Phelps. It focuses on asset-backed securities, including \nplans for securitized mortgages, which have not yet been developed in Indonesia. Development \nof the financial sector and the capital markets in particular is hampered by an inability to obtain \nand/or enforce timely commercial judgments. Support has been provided to the judiciary by \nother agencies to enhance its capacity (Appendix 3) but more assistance is required.  \n \n26.  Need  for  Stronger  Corporate  Governance.  In  March 2005, a World Bank review \nassessed  the  extent  to  which  corporate  governance  in  Indonesia  was  in  conformity  with \nOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) standards. It concluded that \na number of initiatives are underway that could eventually result in compliance with the OECD \nprinciples. However, practices and enforcement diverge. ADB has supported the development \nof  a  corporate  governance  code  for  state-owned  enterprises  and  a  strengthening  of  the \ngovernance  standards  under  the  listing  requirements  for  the  JSX.12 Guidelines  to  improve \nperformance and corporate governance at state-owned banks was issued in February 2007.  \n \n27.  Sharia-Based Capital Market Products. Islamic finance in Indonesia is newer than \nconventional finance, but has grown rapidly. Bank Indonesia has developed a blueprint for \nsharia banking derived from Islamic values. Sharia-based capital market products were first \nintroduced in Indonesia by a sharia investment fund in mid-1997. At the end of 2006, there were \n20 sharia investment funds (5% of total investment funds in Indonesia). As of December 2006, \nthe total net asset value of these funds was Rp664 billion (1.3% of the total net asset value of \ninvestment funds in Indonesia), 18.7% higher than in 2005. The Government plans to issue a \nnew  sharia  bond  called  sukuks  once  the  draft  bill  on  sharia-based  instruments  that  was \nsubmitted to the parliament in February 2007 is passed.  \n \n28.  Need  for  Coordinated  Supervision.  There  is  a  global  trend  toward  financial \nconglomerates, and a tendency for banks and other financial institutions to compete in the same \nmarket segments. There is therefore a need for consolidated and coordinated supervision to \nprevent regulatory arbitrage by important institutions. Bank Indonesia has adopted consolidated \nsupervision of financial groups and their subsidiaries, but there is also a need for information \nsharing and cooperation with Bapepam-LK in relation to entities that are covered by both \nregulators. Such cooperation mechanisms are common in other jurisdictions (e.g., the United \nStates) and need to be extended to other supervisors such as the Deposit Insurance Institution \n(LPS).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n12  ADB 2001. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nRepublic of Indonesia for State-Owned Enterprise Governance and Privatization Program. Manila. \n ", "10   \nB.  Issues and Opportunities \n29.  Financial sector reforms are crucial to raising Indonesia\u2019s growth rate and to enhancing \nthe  economy\u2019s  resilience.  Since  1997  Indonesia  has  successfully  undertaken  key  financial \nreforms, restoring the banking sector to solvency and profitability. However, economic growth \nhas not returned to pre-crisis levels. Indonesia needs investments, especially in infrastructure, \nbut the domestic financial sector is not yet able to finance them. The financial sector is shallow \nand dominated by banks. Bank lending has not yet recovered to pre-crisis levels and banks\u2019 \nbalance sheets make them unsuited to the nation\u2019s need for long-term financing. The nonbank \nfinancial sector, in particular, the capital markets, although still small, offer a major opportunity \nto reinvigorate growth thorough more efficient intermediation.   \n \n30.  Transparency and information disclosure have to be strengthened to build confidence in \ncapital markets and institutions, facilitate regulatory oversight, and promote price discovery and \nmarket liquidity. The supply and demand sides of financial markets both need to be addressed. \nOn the supply side, the government bond market needs to be deepened as it is an essential \nbuilding block for the corporate bond and the interbank money markets. On the demand side, \nthe  investor  base  needs  to  be  broadened  by  encouraging  institutional  investors  such  as \ncontractual savings and collective investment schemes. The structure for trading of securities \nhas to be strengthened to make markets fast, efficient, and accountable. Finally, the operational \nand financial autonomy of the regulatory and supervisory authorities needs to be strengthened \nto protect investors. \n \n  1.  Enhance Price Information and Price Discovery  \n   \n31.  The Indonesian debt market has long suffered from a lack of price transparency in both \ngovernment and corporate bonds and no entity is able to offer a credible and reliable fair \nvaluation service to the overall market. Availability of reliable and timely information is critical for \ncapital markets to function efficiently and for the prices to reflect the fundamentals. The OECD \nprinciples of good governance suggest that firms should disclose all material information in \naccordance  with  high  standards  of  accounting  and  financial  and  nonfinancial  disclosure. \nPreviously, there was no mandatory post-trade reporting regulation for market participants in the \ngovernment and corporate bond markets and no mechanisms to enable consolidation of market \ndata or provision of real time information. Prior to November 2007, SSX provided an over-the- \ncounter  fixed  income  trading  system  that  can  be  used  to  quote  prices,  review  product \ninformation, and facilitate negotiation and trade reporting for government and corporate bonds \nbut the dealers had few incentives to use the system. Effective November 2007, the over-the- \ncounter  fixed  income  trading  system  has  been  replaced by  a  centralized  trading  platform. \nDisclosure is generally weak for corporate bonds and enforcement of disclosure requirements \nhas  not  been  sufficiently  rigorous.  Despite  the  extensive  rules  governing  mutual  funds, \ndisclosure in the areas of investment policy and the calculation of net asset value and sales \nprocedures is inadequate. Many of the largest mutual funds do not follow the norms of valuation \nestablished by Bapepam-LK. Although listed companies adhere to the regular reporting of their \nfinancial results, there is still considerable room for improving the prompt disclosure of market-\nsensitive information and for strengthening the scope and content of disclosure. \n \n  2.   Develop Deeper and More Liquid Capital Markets \n \n32.  The markets are smaller and the secondary markets are less liquid than those of most \nother Southeast Asian economies (para. 21). The market value more than trebled between 2000 \nand  2005  to  $81  billion,  but  this  was  not  a  significant  increase  over  the  1999  market \n ", "    11 \ncapitalization of $64 billion. While 2006 saw a sharp increase to $139 billion, Indonesia still \nremains the fourth smallest market in the Asia and Pacific region. The biggest constraint on the \ndevelopment of the bond markets is the limited liquidity in the secondary markets\u2014which affects \nthe efficiency of the market overall. Against this background, Indonesia faces two challenges: \nfirst, catching up with its neighbors; and second, ensuring that it is able to participate in ongoing \nefforts to integrate regional markets and economies.  \n \n33.  Issuance  and  Market  for  Corporate  and  Government  Debt  Securities.  The \nIndonesian corporate bond market is still at its infancy and is heavily dependent on bank \nfinance. While the small corporate bond market has grown, the lack of a clear benchmark to \nprice  against  hinders  pricing,  although  improvements  in  government  bond  issuance  are \nexpected  to  address  this.  However,  the  Indonesian  government  bond  market  suffers  from \nunequal market access, unequal transactional costs, skewed product distribution, and a lack of \nbenchmark securities. The timetable for the issuance of government bonds is not published in \nadvance and Bank Indonesia does not act as a price taker. It has rejected bids and canceled \nauctions. This increases the risk to participants, which increases the cost of debt and reduces \nthe attractiveness of the market. The lack of market making by intermediaries and the absence \nof credible benchmarks (in short-, medium-, and long-term securities) or any form of hedging \nmechanism have affected overall price formation. In 2006, on average the Indonesian bond \nmarket experienced a daily spread of 70\u2013100 basis points, one of the highest in emerging \nmarkets. A lack of inter-agency policy coordination hampers overall development and adds \nmarket distortions. \n \n34.  Another issue that affects market efficiency is the Bank Indonesia\u2019s scripless securities \nsettlement system, which undertakes the depository activity for government bonds but does not \nprovide  access  for  nonbanking  institutions  who  are  not  subregistries.  The  level  of  system \nintegration with the subregistries is poor and contributes heavily to operational costs and the \nlack  of  straight-through  processing  capabilities  for  the  market  as  a  whole.  Issuance  of \ngovernment securities would improve with a coherent policy for debt issuance, a proper primary \ndealer system, and infrastructure to support the primary and secondary market for government \ndebt securities. ADB is providing TA to Bapepam-LK (footnote 3) to create a more liquid, \ntransparent and competitive bond market with greater and more harmonized access throughout \nthe industry.  \n \n35.  Repurchase markets. The Indonesian Government began a repurchase market in 2004 \nand launched a master repurchase agreement in 2005. However, market participants have \nmajor issues with the agreement as there is a lack of clarity with regard to its terms and \nconditions and the extent to which parties can exercise their rights in the event of default by a \ncounterparty.  As  of  June  2006,  only  five  institutions  had  executed  the  master  repurchase \nagreement to facilitate repurchasing transactions. Another key hurdle is the master repurchase \nagreement structure, which is based on a sale and buy-back with full legal transfer of securities, \nresulting in the participants being taxed at both stages of the transaction.  \n \n36.  Market Liquidity.  In 2006, of the 344 listed companies, 8% (29 companies) had no \ntrade at all while 55% (189 companies) accounted for less than 0.1% of the total trading \nfrequency on the JSX. The key reasons for the illiquidity of these shares are: concentrated \nshare ownership causing minimum real free float, an absence of corporate action plans, weak \ninvestor relations, and insufficient provision of information to the public. As a consequence the \nmarket remains small and illiquid and this restricts the development of domestic institutional \ninvestors. The process of listing in Indonesia is unnecessarily cumbersome and time-consuming \nand companies have few incentives to list. Taxation has been a major issue, as unequal tax \n ", "12   \ntreatment  of  institutions  has  significantly  affected  the  overall  participation  of  market \nintermediaries, especially securities firms. Stock option products were launched 2 years ago but \ndid not find much favor with the market as the rules were not considered attractive. \n \n37.  It will be important for Indonesia\u2019s capital market to develop supporting infrastructure. In \naddition to repurchase markets (para. 35), securities lending, margin trading (in particular, short \nselling), and a derivatives market need to be developed. The lack of these instruments and \nfacilities reduces liquidity and increases the transaction costs of trading. Liquidity will also be \nimproved  through  measures  to  widen  the  investor  base,  in  part  through  encouraging  the \nintroduction of different types of products to suit the different risk preferences of investors. \nThese  include  exchange-traded  funds,  municipal  bonds,  asset-  and  mortgage-backed \nsecurities, and sharia products. There were no significant government divestments of state-\nowned enterprises in 2005 and 2006. There needs to be a focused strategy and plan for the \ndivestment of the Government\u2019s ownership of SOEs in order to increase the supply of securities \nto the capital market. Private pension funds would also benefit from better asset allocation and \ninvestment policies and lower costs.  \n \nFigure 2: Efficiency of the Indonesian Securities Markets \n \nC\nLiquidity  Investor base very low \nInstitutional investors limited \nSavings rate low at 25% \nFree float very small \nB Not many listed companies \nA  Transaction costs  \nInformation to  (explicit taxes, commissions, \nprice accurately  fees and impact)  Transaction costs high \ncompared with other \nregional exchanges \n\u2022 90% of the bonds traded  Corporate \nare government securities  Governance\n\u2022 Crowding out other \n\u2022 High concentrated \ninstruments \nownership of the  Market Infrastructure  Complementary \n\u2022 True yield curve yet to \npublicly listed  and Mechanisms Structure\nemerge \ncorporate sector \n\u2022 Plan to establish Bond  \u2022 Mutual exchange  \u2022 Short \n\u2022 Limited float \nPricing Agency  structure  selling/margin \n\u2022 Low corporate \n\u2022 Dealers mostly banks  \u2022 Settlement T+3  trading needs \ngovernance \n\u2022 Need to improve  (3 days after the     revision \n\u2022 Minority shareholders \ntransparency in pricing  date of trade)  \u2022 Not many \nneed legal \n\u2022 One credit-rating agency  \u2022 No investor  hedging \nempowerment \n\u2022 Limited issues of private  protection fund  instruments \n\u2022 Bankruptcy law needs \ndebt papers  \u2022 Not so very \nrevision \n\u2022 Disclosure needs  conducive tax \nimprovement  environment \n \n \n38.  Mutual Exchange Structure. The mutual structure plus the existence of two competing \nexchanges without clear roles suggests that the exchanges will be slow to innovate and to \nrespond to investor and issuer needs and that they will regulate poorly. Mutual structures are \ngenerally recognized to be a poor governance structure for modern exchanges. An exchange \noffering all exchange-traded products and run as a commercial company\u2014ideally with its own \nlisting\u2014would serve the Indonesian market better. A feasibility study on a possible merger of \n ", "    13 \nthe two exchanges revealed that it makes business sense for them to merge, and that this \nwould improve governance and lead to savings through shared information technology and \nhuman resources.  \n \n  3.  Improve Market Surveillance and Investor Protection \n \n39.  Regulatory  Structure.  A  strong  Bapepam-LK  is  needed  for  a  coherent  policy  and \nregulatory approach to the nonbank financial sector. However, Bapepam-LK is still part of the \nMOF and does not have the same autonomy or human resource capacity as Bank Indonesia. A \ncrisis  in  the  mutual  fund  industry  in  2005  revealed  the consequences  of  weak regulation, \nalthough swift and resolute action by Bapepam-LK prevented a more serious crisis. A better \nresourced and more autonomous regulator of nonbank financial institutions is needed before the \nestablishment of the OJK in 2010. The merger of Bapepam and DGFI to form Bapepam-LK \noffers an opportunity to create such a strong and independent regulator. Bapepam-LK staff lack \nlegal immunity when carrying out their supervisory functions. Revisions to the Capital Market, \nPension  and  Insurance  Laws  also  need  to  be  accelerated  so  legislation  complies  with \nInternational  Organization  of  Securities  Commissions  (IOSCO)  principles  for  securities, \nInternational Association of Insurance Supervisors core principles, and OECD guidelines for \noccupational pensions. Major steps are also being undertaken to strengthen the integrity of \npublic  institutions  such  as  MOF  and  Bapepam-LK  through  major  restructuring  of  key \ndepartments, combined with significant pay increases for staff and the introduction of strict \nperformance and ethical standards. \n \n40.  Regulation and Supervision. The legal and regulatory environment for mutual funds \nneeds to be improved. The legislation is an amalgam of US regulations for corporate funds \n(which do not exist in Indonesia) with a few references to contractual funds (i.e., all mutual funds \nin Indonesia). The sections of the Capital Market Law that pertain to mutual funds and the \nassociated regulations need to be amended in order to restore investor confidence in mutual \nfunds  following  the  recent  crisis  and  to  develop  the  industry.  Bapepam-LK\u2019s  investigation \nprocedures need to be streamlined and the flow of information improved so administrative \nsanctions can be imposed more easily. For suspected criminal offences, better coordination and \ncooperation  with  the  judicial  branch  is  needed.  To  strengthen  its  internal  governance  and \naccountability Bapepam-LK needs to establish an internal compliance bureau with a code of \nconduct for officials and staff. Bapepam-LK\u2019s organizational structure needs to move toward a \nmore  functional  approach  to  address  gaps  in  regulatory  and  supervisory  oversight  and  to \nharmonize regulation and supervision.  \n \n41.  Investor Protection. Indonesia does not have an investor protection fund to protect \ninvestors in the event of broker default. The rules require securities firms to take out insurance \nto cover this eventuality but such insurance is not available and the rule has not been enforced. \nThis  exposes  investors  to  significant  risk  and  is likely  to  deter  investors  of  all  sizes  from \nparticipating in the market. Investor protection funds are typically built up by contributions from \nbrokers. \n \n42.  International Cooperation. Bapepam-LK has entered into bilateral arrangements with \ndomestic  and  foreign  regulators  and  is  seeking  membership  of  the  IOSCO  multilateral \nmemorandum of understanding. However, it is currently prevented from joining because of a \nlack of legal clarity with regard to its powers to (i) share confidential data with other regulators, \n(ii)  access  bank  records  and  identify  beneficial  ownership  of  shares,  and  (iii)  guarantee \nconfidentiality of requests from foreign regulators. Bilateral MOUs with foreign capital markets \nregulators will help strengthen information sharing.   \n ", "14   \n43.  Risk-based Supervision in Contractual Savings Industry. In 2000 Indonesia became \nthe first country in Asia to implement modern risk-based capital requirements for both life and \ngeneral insurers. The Bureau of Insurance has been moving toward risk-based supervision \nalthough more rapid progress is necessary. Implementation of risk-based capital regulations \nneed to be reviewed and corporate governance standards enforced. The pension industry also \nneeds to move toward risk-based supervision. \n \n  4.  Improve Governance and Human Resource Capacity \n \n44.  Coordination among Regulators. If there is more than one regulator, each needs to \nhave very clear and precise objectives, be subject to extensive disclosure requirements, and be \n \npublicly accountable.There also need to be adequate arrangements, preferably documented, to \nensure the regulators cooperate when necessary, and that they have powers to exchange \nrelevant information. Incentives for regulatory arbitrage should be recognized and minimized, \nand regulatory gaps spotted and filled at an early stage. Formal coordination between Bank \nIndonesia, the MOF, and the Deposit Insurance Institution (LPS) needs to be clearly outlined to \nprevent potential risks to the system\u2019s stability. \n \n45.  Anti-Money-Laundering  Regime.  While  considerable  progress  has  been  made  in \nstrengthening the anti-money-laundering regime for the banking sector, the nonbank financial \nsector in Indonesia currently lags in comparison, in terms of the effectiveness of regulations and \nsupervision, as well as in the capacity of institutions to comply with the law. To reduce the risk of \nnonbank  financial  institutions  being  used  as  conduits  for  money  laundering,  regulations, \nsupervision (capacity, enforcement powers, and sanctions), and capacity for compliance will \nneed to be strengthened to achieve parity with the banking sector.  \n \n46.  Institutional Capacity. The newly created Bapepam-LK will require support over the \nmedium term for it to become an effective regulator. Governance of regulatory agencies and \nmarket institutions requires staff with graduate level education in actuarial science and finance \nand experience in regulatory practices and market surveillance in developed markets. Acquiring \nthese  skills  is  a  pre-condition  for  success  but  will  be  a  major  challenge,  requiring  the \nGovernment to commit adequate resources over the medium and long term if technical and \nregulatory excellence is to be achieved. \n  \nC.  Lessons \n \n47.  ADB\u2019s Financial Sector Intervention in Indonesia. ADB has undertaken four major \nfinancial sector operations in Indonesia addressing banking, capital markets, pensions, and \ninsurance over the last 19 years. The thrust of financial sector reforms over this period moved \nfrom a focus on deregulation of the banking sector and capital market to implementation of a \ncomprehensive set of reforms aimed at strengthening potential safeguards while encouraging \nmarket forces and market efficiency. The rapid growth that occurred after deregulation and the \nsubsequent problems in the banking sector highlighted inadequacies in the legal, regulatory, \nand supervisory frameworks, while underpinning the importance of a long-term approach to \nstrengthening capacity. \n \n ", "    15 \n48.  First and Second Financial Sector Program (1988 and 1992).13 The first program was \naimed at improving domestic resource mobilization by the financial sector, reducing market \nsegmentation, and encouraging competition among financial institutions, while ensuring the \nsoundness of the financial system. The main objectives of the second program were to ensure \nthe long-term strength and stability of the financial system by introducing prudential safeguards \nand creating and strengthening basic legal, regulatory, and supervisory frameworks. \n \n49.  Financial Governance Reforms Sector Development Program (FGRSDP).14 ADB\u2019s \nsupport to the financial sector was an integral part of an IMF-led multidonor rescue package to \nhelp Indonesia overcome the Asian financial crisis. The intent of the program was to help \nIndonesia respond to the immediate exigencies of the crisis, as well as to reduce the country\u2019s \nvulnerability to future crises. FGRSDP made significant progress in improving the governance of \nfinancial and public sector allocation of resources. Despite delays in implementation, the policy \nmeasures supported by FGRSDP helped restore financial sector health through consolidation of \nstate-owned banks, closure of insolvent private banks, recapitalization of viable banks, and the \ntransfer  of  nonperforming  loans  to  the  Indonesian  Bank  Restructuring  Agency.  Through \nFGRSDP, ADB was one of Indonesia's key development partners throughout the crisis, and the \nprogram provided an essential platform for continuing policy dialogue at the highest level. \nFGRSDP  was  rated  as  successful.15 However,  continued  weaknesses  in  financial  sector \ngovernance have undermined the potential for higher growth. \n \n50.  Financial Governance and Social Security Reform Program (FGSSR 2002).16 In \n1999, parliament passed a Banking Law which was pivotal in insulating the regulatory and \nsupervisory  framework  from  political  interference.  In  2000,  the  Government  asked  ADB  to \nsupport  the  development  of  a  blueprint  for  an  integrated  financial  services  supervisory \ninstitution, referred to as the OJK, to make efficient use of scarce regulatory resources and \nstrengthen  harmonization  of  regulation  across  sectors.  The  legislation  required  the \nestablishment of the OJK by the end of 2002. The FGSSR was broadly conceived to support the \neffective implementation of nonbank financial sector reform, including establishing the OJK, \nrestructuring pension plans, amending relevant laws and regulations, and consolidating the \ninsurance sector. \n \n51.  FGSSR-I has been partly effective in achieving its goals, although OJK in its intended \nform remains a medium-term objective (paras. 18\u201320). The merger of Bapepam and the DGFI \ninto Bapepam-LK, and the endorsement of a plan for continuing improvements in the regulatory \nand supervisory structure of the newly created entity are significant steps towards strengthening \nthe supervision of nonbank financial services. Market participants see these as positive moves \nthat will facilitate supervision along functional lines and encourage greater participation by \ninstitutional investors in capital markets. However, continued capacity building is required and \nthe legal framework for enforcement needs to be further improved. \n                                                 \n13 ADB. 1988.

ADB TA (footnote 3) has focused on strengthening \nBapepam-LK, and provided support for the preparation of a nonbank financial sector action \nplan, an assessment of Indonesian standards in meeting IOSCO principles for capital market \nregulation, and evaluation of training needs within Bapepam-LK. It has also supported the \ndevelopment of the bond market, improvements to the research and surveillance functions of \nBapepam-LK, and the preparation of regulations and guidelines for Islamic financial products. \nThe  measures  included  under  the  program  reflect  extensive  dialogue,  including  a  major \nworkshop on key issues and findings from the TA in Jakarta in November 2006.   \n \n53.  Lessons Learned. Broadly-based reforms require long-term institutional development \nand must be fully aligned with the Government\u2019s national and sector development plans. The \nprogram cluster approach is a useful tool in this regard, as it combines a long-term approach \ncovering a wide range of policy and institutional reforms and with flexibility to adjust to changing \ncircumstances. It allows the gradual introduction of critical components in the sector, including a \ncomprehensive  legal  framework  and  an  action  plan.  Program  clusters  can  also  enable \nbenchmarks to be established and unify policy makers who advocate reforms. The program \ncompletion report (PCR)17 for FGSSR recommended a framework based on single-tranche \nprograms within a program loan cluster to provide more flexibility while focusing on achievable, \nupfront  outcomes.  Much  of  the  success  of  such  an  approach  will  depend  on  a  genuine \ncommitment by stakeholders. The Indonesia country assistance program evaluation18 noted that \nthe ADB financial sector projects and programs in Indonesia have generally performed well.  \n \n54.  These key lessons demonstrate the importance of (i) a medium-term policy framework \nsupported  by  a  program  cluster  and  tranching  structure  that  ensures  adequate  time  and \nflexibility  in  formulation  and  implementation  of  a  reform  agenda;  (ii)  participatory  dialogue;  \n(iii) the emergence of a stakeholder voice and a reform champion; and (iv) TA design that \nensures adequate resources are made available for a sufficient duration, with a view not only to \ndeveloping policy recommendations, but also to supporting implementation. The Program is a \nmedium-term  program  cluster  that  reflects  (i)  ADB\u2019s  confidence  in  the  Government\u2019s \ncommitment to a medium-term agenda in which it has ownership; (ii) a focus on a broad \nassessment of progress and the implementation capacity of the authorities, rather than on \ntraditional conditions; and (iii) a program design that will assist the authorities to implement their \nstrategy. \n \nTable 4: Strategic Focus for ADB Financial Sector Operations in Indonesia \n \nConstraints  Medium-Term  Lessons from ADB operations  CSP Areas of \nNational  Engagement \nDevelopment \nPlan Targets \nLack of depth   Private financing of  \u2022  Post-crisis  reforms  inadequate  to  achieve  Financial sector \nand breadth in  infrastructure  greater depth  deepening \nthe financial  \u2022  ADB long-term support for regulatory reforms   \nsector  \u2022  Support  to  be  translated  to  achieve  faster   \nmarket and product development \nSource: ADB. 2006.

THE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n \nA.  Objectives and Scope \n \n55.  The goal of the proposed Capital Market Development Program is to promote financial \nsector diversification and resilience while supporting the medium-term macroeconomic goals of \nthe Government, in particular an average annual GDP growth of 5.5\u20137.6% during 2005\u20132009 \nand  halving  the  poverty  rate  from  16.6%  to  8.2%  during  the  same  period.  The  expected \noutcome of the Program is sufficient capital market growth to diversify the markets, combined \nwith a stronger regulatory and supervisory capacity that will ensure the resilience of the financial \nsector and the economy as a whole. It is expected that the Program will lead to an increase in \nthe nonbank financial sector\u2019s share of total financial assets. To ensure this outcome, a policy \nreform program has been initiated over January 2006\u2212December 2010 aimed at enhancing \ninformation disclosure and improving price discovery, creating deeper and more liquid capital \nmarkets, providing for better market surveillance and investor protection, and strengthening \ngovernance and human resource capacity in market institutions. The Program supports the \nGovernment\u2019s  financial  sector  reform  agenda,  with  a  focus  on  the  development  of  capital \nmarkets.  \n \n56.   A program cluster modality is proposed, consisting of two single-tranche subprograms \nanchored on the Government\u2019s financial sector reform programs. The program period is from \nJanuary 2006 to December 2010, with a single tranche loan of $300 million to be disbursed \nunder subprogram 1 (2006\u20132007) based on a range of upfront actions taken by the Government \nin the core areas. As shown in the policy matrix in Appendix 4, the actions have been split into \ntwo phases, January 2006\u2212September 2007 for subprogram 1 (recognizing measures already \ntaken by the Government), and October 2007\u2212June 2009 for subprogram 2. The Government\u2019s \nmedium-term national reform agenda and its timing will be reviewed in light of the achievements \nof subprogram 1 and possible changes in the policy environment. It will be modified if necessary \nand  supported  by  subprogram  2.  The  Government  envisages  support  from  ADB  of  $200 \nmillion\u2212$300 million for subprogram 2.  \n \nB.  Policy Framework and Actions \n \n57.  The policy measures supported by the Program include a set of sector reforms to \npromote financial diversification by enhancing the growth and development of capital markets. \nThe reform agenda is structured around the following policy outcomes, which form the basis of \nthe four components of the Program: \n \n(i)  enhancing information disclosure and price discovery, \n(ii)  promoting deeper and more liquid financial markets, \n(iii)  improving market surveillance and investor protection, and \n(iv)  strengthening governance and human resource capacity. \n \n1.  Component 1: Enhancing Information Disclosure and Price Discovery \n58.  These policy actions are the most important for the development of the capital markets. \nBapepam-LK has issued rules requiring prompt disclosure of secondary trading in bonds and for \nissuers of bonds to have an annual rating while their securities are outstanding. This will enable \nmarket valuation of fixed income instruments. Effective November 2007, the over-the-counter \nfixed income trading system at the SSX has been replaced by a centralized trading platform, \nwhich has many advantages over the previous system as it adds value to fixed-income trading \n ", "18   \nwith  improved  trade  execution,  transparent  pricing,  competitive  data  and  lower  costs. \nSubprogram 1 supports the issuance of regulations to establish a bond pricing agency in the \nprivate  sector.  These  measures  will  improve  transparency  and  lead  to  a  fairer  trading \nenvironment in the bond market. They are aimed at addressing the major regulatory failures in \n2005 that resulted in the mispricing of fixed income securities in mutual funds and a resultant \nloss  of  confidence  among  mutual  fund  investors  that  led  to  a  fall  in  the  assets  under \nmanagement. The bond pricing agency is expected to be established in 2008 with a mandate to \nprovide  an  independent  and  objective  daily  fair  value  of  all  bonds.  All  issuers  and  public \ncompanies will be required to provide information on corporate governance as part of their \nannual reports. Policy measures under component 1 are summarized below and the individual \npolicy actions are in Appendix 4: \n \n  (i)  1.1 strengthen price information disclosure; \n  (ii)  1.2 enhance market valuation of fixed income instruments; and \n  (iii)  1.3 improve market transparency. \n \n2.  Component 2: Promoting Deeper and More Liquid Financial Markets \n59.  The policy actions under subprogram 1 are designed to promote liquidity so investors \ncan buy or sell within narrow margins without affecting the market price. Depth and liquidity are \nessential to achieve market efficiency and resilience in the face of volatility and uncertainty in \nexpectations and in financial flows. On the supply side, the Government proposes a sequence \nof measures to develop deeper and more liquid securities markets, particularly at the short end \nof the market, where repurchase agreements will be encouraged. To facilitate the development \nof  the  repurchase  market  subprogram  I  supports  the  issuance  of  guidelines  clarifying  the \naccounting treatment for repurchase transactions, while under subprogram 2, Bapepam-LK will \ncooperate with Bank Indonesia to promote the use of the master agreement in all open market \nrepurchase transactions, whether with Bank Indonesia\u2019s certificates or with new treasury bills \nissued  by  the  Debt  Management  Office.  Subprogram  1  also  supports  the  development  of \nbenchmark yields for government bonds by concentrating issuance of government bonds at \nselected maturities of 5, 7, 10, 15, and 20 years. A primary dealer system has been established \nwith market-making responsibilities in government debt securities to ensure two-way quotes, \nthereby supporting the secondary market. To develop the short-term government debt market, \ntreasury bills of 12 months maturity have been issued. The Government will gradually progress \nissuance of treasury bills down to 1 month maturity with the longer term objective of gradually \nreplacing short-term bills issued by Bank Indonesia. Revised regulations on short selling and \nmargin trading are expected to be issued by the end of 2007. The Government has also \ndivested itself of 15% of its holding in the state-owned PT Bank Negara Indonesia through an \ninitial public offering in August 2007. It plans to seek parliamentary approval to divest itself of 11 \nmore SOEs by the end of 2007 and 16 more in 2008, thereby increasing the supply of securities \nto the capital markets.  \n \n60.  To develop the investor base, subprogram 1 supports the issuance of government bonds \nin small denominations to attract the retail public. Rules have been issued to facilitate the \nissuance of new products such as municipal bonds, sharia-based instruments, exchange-traded \nfunds and securitization of asset-backed receivables such as mortgages. Development of the \nhousing finance industry is another priority and amendments are planned to Presidential Decree \n18/2005 to enable the Secondary Mortgage Corporation (PT. Sarana Multigriya Finansial) to \nlend up to 10 years enabling it to develop a critical mass of primary mortgage receivables. This \nmeasure is expected to lead eventually to a secondary market for the securitization of mortgage \nreceivables. Many of these new products will also benefit from MOF\u2019s amendments to the tax \n ", "    19 \nlaw now under consideration by parliament. A draft decree to provide tax incentives to increase \nthe number of listed companies and the pubic float of shares has been submitted by MOF under \nsubprogram 1 for presidential approval within 2007.  \n \n61.  The infrastructure for trading is also being enhanced. Screen-based trading has been \nintroduced countrywide. The merger of the two stock exchanges in a new exchange in Jakarta \nhas been approved by their shareholders. The Corporate Law has been amended to allow for \nstock exchange companies to be owned by a single legal entity. This is expected to improve \ngovernance of the stock exchange while broadening ownership and integrating offerings of debt \nand equity securities. Policy measures under component 2 are summarized below and the \nindividual policy actions are in Appendix 4: \n \n  (i)  2.1 develop the government bond market; \n  (ii)  2.2 improve secondary market liquidity; \n  (iii)  2.3 improve overall market access and reduce transaction costs; \n  (iv)  2.4 develop new market sectors, products and hedging instruments; \n  (v)  2.5 enhance performance of contractual savings industry; \n  (vi)  2.6 strengthen governance of stock exchange; and \n  (vii)  2.7 promote more conducive tax environment for capital markets development. \n \n3.  Component 3: Improving Market Surveillance and Investor Protection \n62.  Indonesia recognizes that the IOSCO principles for investor protection provide a basis \nfor the development of modern capital markets. In line with these principles, Bapepam-LK\u2019s \noperational and financial autonomy is being enhanced through legal and regulatory measures \ndesigned to provide strengthened regulation of capital markets and the contractual savings \nindustry. Subprogram 1 supports the development and submission of a proposal to the Minister \nof Finance to consider an appropriate regulatory structure for the capital markets and the \nnonbank financial institutions supervisory agency. This would be independent of the Ministry of \nFinance but report to the Minister of Finance, with powers to recruit staff outside the civil service \ncode. After addressing the constraints to the recruitment of staff under the civil service code, \nsubprogram 2 will support the implementation of the regulatory framework. Amendments to the \nCapital  Market  Law,  the  Insurance  Law,  and  the  Pension  Law  have  been  drafted  under \nsubprogram 1 to strengthen the regulators\u2019 oversight and enforcement powers in line with \ninternational best practices. They have been submitted to the Minister of Finance with the aim of \nsubmitting  them  to  parliament  for  consideration  in  2008.  The  draft  amendments  include \nadequate provisions for legal immunity from civil suits for staff of Bapepam-LK while carrying out \ntheir  duties  and  acting  in  good  faith.  The  proposed  measures  for  greater  operational  and \nfinancial autonomy will also be accompanied by greater accountability. To ensure appropriate \nregulation of capital markets and contractual savings products, irrespective of who is providing \nthose  products,  subprogram  1  supports  a  move  toward  a  more  functional  approach  to \nregulation, which will be phased in over 2007\u20132009. Risk-based supervision will be extended to \nall institutions in the capital markets and the contractual savings industries. \n \n63.  Bapepam-LK has entered into bilateral MOUs with a number of the foreign regulators to \nstrengthen information sharing, particularly in connection with securities fraud. Bapepam-LK \nalso proposes to enter into agreements with foreign regulators to exchange information for \ncross-border regulatory enforcement.  \n \n64.  Regulation of the mutual fund industry will be strengthened under subprogram 1, which \nwill also support a feasibility study for a securities market investor protection fund. Subprogram \n ", "20   \n2 will support a plan for its implementation. The key will be to provide investor protection \nthrough  market  surveillance  and  regulation.  Policy  measures  under  component  3  are \nsummarized below and the individual policy actions are in Appendix 4: \n \n  (i)  3.1 strengthen autonomy, accountability, supervisory, and regulatory powers of \n  Bapepam-LK; \n  (ii)  3.2 promote international cooperation; \n  (iii)  3.3 rationalize the organizational structure of Bapepam-LK; \n  (iv)  3.4 enhance risk-based supervision of contractual savings industry; and \n  (v)  3.5 strengthen investor protection. \n \n4.  Component 4: Strengthening Governance and Human Resource Capacity \n65.  To improve governance there needs to be better coordination among the regulators, \nnotably MOF, Bank Indonesia and related agencies such as LPS. For a more consolidated \napproach, addressing harmonization and coordination of supervisory and regulatory methods \nand policies, reporting and information exchange and dissemination, and consumer protection \nand education, an MOU on the establishment of a Financial System Stability Forum was signed \nin June 2007 by MOF, Bank Indonesia, and LPS. Subprogram 1 supports the establishment of \nthe forum which will be strengthened over the program period. The forum aims to promote \ninformation  exchange  among  fiscal  and  monetary  authorities  and  cooperation  in  financial \nsupervision  and  surveillance.  The  forum  has  members  from  the  financial  supervisory  and \nregulatory agencies and will make a number of important recommendations, including on the \nfinancial system architecture and implementation of the financial sector assessment program. \nTo  reduce  the  risk  of  nonbank  financial  institutions  being  used  as  conduits  for  money \nlaundering, subprogram 1 will support a systematic approach to money laundering and know-\nyour-customer rules for nonbank financial institutions.  \n \n66.  A medium- to long-term agenda will be needed for human resource development. The \nProgram will support the strengthening of the actuarial profession. Bapepam-LK has signed an \nMOU with the University of Indonesia to develop and adopt a plan of collaboration to serve the \nresearch needs of the capital markets and contractual savings industries. These collaborative \nefforts will become fully operational under subprogram 2. In addition, Bapepam-LK has adopted \na medium-term plan to develop regulatory information and the research capability to  meet \ncurrent and future needs. The Program\u2019s associated TA (Appendix 7) will help meet immediate \nneeds as well as support a systematic approach to medium- and long-term capacity building \nefforts. The Government will commit enough resources to meet the capacity-building needs in \nthe area of capital markets and nonbank financial institutions over the medium and long term.  \nBased on initial feasibility studies, $18 million over the 2008\u20132012 period will be allocated in the \nGovernment budget for human resource development over the medium term (e.g., support for \nsecondments, specialized recruitment and advanced training, specialized training, and support \nthrough  academic  institutions).  With  well-trained  regulators,  regulatory  implementation  and \neffectiveness  will  be  significantly  enhanced.  Policy  measures  under  component  3  are \nsummarized below and the individual policy actions are in Appendix 4: \n \n  (i)  4.1 improve overall financial sector risk-management though better    \n    coordination; \n  (ii)  4.2 strengthen the anti-money-laundering regime; \n  (iii)  4.3 strengthen actuarial profession; and \n  (iv)  4.4 enhance industry skills and capacity for capital markets and contractual  \n     savings. \n ", "    21 \nC.  Important Features \n \n67.  The Program has a number of distinct and innovative features. First, there is strong \nGovernment commitment to the development of capital markets through the CMMP and the \nFSPP. These initiatives represent a combination of economic, business, legal, and regulatory \nfactors designed to enhance the role of the Indonesian capital market as an engine of economic \ngrowth. Second, the Program supports qualitative changes to processes to ensure effective \nimplementation. It focuses on outcomes and allows for greater flexibility in actions necessary to \nachieve compliance. Third, it is predicated on the need for a policy and institutional response to \nsignificant market developments since the completion of the FGSSR. Fourth, the Program has \nhelped establish a program coordination committee that will be responsible for implementing the \naction plan adopted for the CMMP and the FSPP. Fifth, it includes an indicative policy reform \nagenda for subprogram 2 that builds upon subprogram 1 reforms, thus providing for flexibility in \ndeveloping subprogram 2. \n \nD.  Financing Plan \n \n68.  The  proposed  single-tranche  loan  for  subprogram  1  of  $300  million  will  help  the \nGovernment meet its medium-term financing needs. The loan will be provided from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources. It will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years, an \ninterest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility, and a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum.19 The Government has \nprovided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices \nwere its own independent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice \nfrom ADB. The Republic of Indonesia will be the Borrower. The loan for subprogram 1 will be \nreleased in one tranche when the conditions of the policy matrix have been met and upon loan \neffectiveness. The Government envisages a loan of $200 million to $300 million to finance \nsubprogram 2. The processing of subprogram 2 will be subject to adequate progress of reforms \nand the Government\u2019s readiness to continue with its reform agenda. \n \n69.  Government debt as a share of GDP improved to 41% in 2006 from 45% in 2005 and is \nprojected to fall to about 30% in 2009. The fiscal deficit is projected to increase from the original \nestimate of 1.1% of GDP to 1.5% in 2007. The Government has sought $2.1 billion in program \nloans (Table 5), based on its decision not to exceed its limits on the issuance of domestic \nbonds. The modest increase in the deficit target for 2007 and 2008 from earlier projections is \nexpected  to  create  some  room  for  additional  development  spending.  With  high  projected \nrevenues and secure financing, development spending is projected to increase from 3.1% of \nGDP in 2006 to 3.9% in 2010 keeping the debt levels sustainable over the medium term. On a \nconsolidated basis, total government investment is projected to increase from 4.8% in 2005 to \n7.7% in 2010. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n19 There will be no commitment charge for the single-tranche loan if it is declared effective and disbursed within \n60 days after the signing of the Loan Agreement. Currently the waiver on the commitment charge of 0.50% is \napplicable to all interest periods commencing from 1 January 2007 up to and including 30 June 2008. \n \n ", "22   \nTable 5: Government\u2019s 2007 Revised Budget Deficit Projections \n \nCategories  Revised Projection  % of GDP \n($ billion) \nA.

The size of the proposed loan is based on (i) the economic importance of the financial \nsector, (ii) the significance of the proposed reforms over the medium term, (iii) the Program\u2019s \ndevelopment impact, and (iv) the Government\u2019s overall financing needs. The political costs \ninvolved in implementing the reforms are considerable and will be felt immediately. Although the \neconomic benefits will greatly outweigh the costs, they will take time to emerge fully. Vested \ninterests  benefit  from  the  current  weak  enforcement  of  securities,  pension  and  insurance \nsubsector regulation; regulatory arbitrage; and the absence of adequate risk management, \nsupervision,  and  transparency  in  securities  trading.  Nevertheless,  the  cost  of  a  delay  in \nimplementing the reforms would be substantially higher for the economy than the adjustment \ncosts. Market forces need an effective and transparent regulatory framework. In the absence of \ntimely reforms, the financial sector will continue to be ineffective in intermediating resources for \nproductive  investment,  financial  institutions  will  remain  vulnerable  to  systemic  risks,  and \ninvestors will be vulnerable to fraud and misconduct. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Program Management \n \n71.  Bapepam-LK will be the Executing Agency for the Program and will monitor and facilitate \nthe implementation of the agreed reform actions to ensure that they are carried out in a timely \n ", "    23 \nmanner. DMO and the Directorate of Taxes (DOT), both under MOF, Bapepeam-LK, Menneg \nBUMN (the State Ministry of State Owned Enterprises), and the Financial System Stability \nForum will be the implementing agencies. Bapepam-LK has established a program coordination \ncommittee headed by the Bapepam-LK chair with representatives from DMO, DOT, Menneg \nBUMN, Bappenas (National Development Planning Agency), and the Financial System Stability \nForum. The committee is responsible for coordinating the implementation and sustaining of the \nprogram actions. The committee shall oversee the implementation of the policy actions detailed \nin the Policy Letter and the Policy Matrix, and provide guidance and direction to the Executing \nAgency, the Implementing Agencies and other relevant line agencies of the Borrower. ADB may \nbe invited to participate in the meetings as an observer. \n \n2.  Implementation Period  \n \n72.  The implementation period for Subprogram 1 is from January 2006 to September 2007. \nThe Government has completed all actions in the policy matrix for subprogram 1. \n \n3.  Procurement and Disbursement  \n \n73.  The loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange cost (excluding local \nduties  and  taxes)  of  items  produced  and  procured  in  ADB  member  countries,  excluding \nineligible items, and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources. In accordance \nwith  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related \nRequirements for Program Loans (1998), the reimbursement procedure will be used to disburse \nthe loan proceeds based on certification by the Borrower. No supporting import documentation \nwill be required if during each year the value of Indonesia\u2019s total imports minus imports from \nnonmember countries, ineligible imports, and imports financed under other official development \nassistance is equal to or greater than the amount of the loan expected to be disbursed during \nsuch year. The Government will certify its compliance with this formula with each withdrawal \nrequest. Otherwise, import documentation under existing procedures will be required. ADB \nreserves the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the \nGovernment\u2019s certification.  \n \n4.  Anticorruption and Fiduciary Assessment \n \n74.  The Government was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to \ndate) and its Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism Policy (2003). \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability and transparency, ADB will \nrequire the Government to institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls \nfollowing international best practice standards for preventing corruption or money laundering \nactivities or the financing of terrorism and covenant with ADB to refrain from engaging in such \nactivities. \n \n75.  The proposed Program directly addresses anticorruption issues in the financial sector \nthrough  its  core  focus  on  strengthening  protection  for  investors  against  fraud  and \nmisrepresentation. This is part of a broader Government agenda to fight corruption and improve \nits  public  financial  management  systems.  Presidential  Decree  80/2003  sets  out  the  basic \nprinciples of procurement: transparency, open and fair competition, economy, and efficiency. \nSeveral state auxiliary bodies have been established with mandates to fight corruption: the \nCommission for Eradication of Corruption, the National Ombudsman Commission, the National \n ", "24   \nLaw Commission, and the Commission for the Eradication of Money Laundering.20 Further, the \nDPSP  cluster  (footnote  5)  has  a  core  focus  on  improving  governance  and  anticorruption \ninitiatives. It promotes transparency in public finance management and aims to strengthen the \nexisting  independent  oversight  mechanisms  by  improving  the  auditing  framework.  The \nGovernment has reorganized MOF, separating the budget and treasury functions, and has \ninitiated steps to increase efficiency and transparency and reduce corruption in public finance \nmanagement.  The  Government  also  places  significant  emphasis  on  strengthening  internal \ncontrol systems and overall public finance management, with support from the World Bank.21 \n \n5.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n76.  ADB retains the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of \nthe  Government\u2019s  certification  for  the  withdrawal  applications.  Before  withdrawal,  the \nGovernment will nominate an account (the Deposit Account) at Bank Indonesia to receive the \nloan proceeds. The account will be managed, operated, and liquidated in accordance with terms \nsatisfactory to ADB. Bapepam-LK will submit progress reports on policy and institutional reform \nimplementation to the program coordination committee and to ADB. These will be submitted in \nsuch form and in such detail as ADB may request, and should include (i) progress made and \nproblems encountered during the period in review, (ii) steps taken or proposed to be taken to \nremedy problems encountered, (iii) proposed detailed activities for program implementation, and \n(iv) expected progress based on (ii) and (iii) above. \n \n6.  Counterpart Funds \n \n77.  Counterpart funds generated by the Program will be used by the Government, under \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB,  to  meet program  expenditures  and  associated  costs  of \nreform and additional budgetary allocation for development spending.  \n \n7.  Monitoring and Review \n \n78.  ADB will, in cooperation with MOF and Bapepam-LK, carry out periodic reviews of \nprogress and outcomes of subprogram I following the subprogram I period. The Government will \nkeep ADB informed of the outcome of policy discussions with other multilateral and bilateral \nagencies that have implications for program implementation, and will provide ADB with the \nopportunity to comment on any resulting policy proposals. ADB, in collaboration with MOF and \nBapepam-LK, will review program performance about 6 months after loan effectiveness to \nreview the outcome of subprogram 1 and begin preparation of subprogram 2. In addition to the \nprogress reports, MOF and Bapepam-LK will submit within 30 days of the subprogram 1 review \nby  ADB,  a  report  that  will  evaluate  implementation  of  the  policy  reform  measures  under \nsubprogram 1. This report will also assess the impact on the sector, describe lessons identified \nduring the program period, and outline reforms and assistance needed for the development of \nthe sector, to enable processing of subprogram 2. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n20 ADB has been closely involved in the establishment and strengthening of the anti-money-laundering regime in \nIndonesia through TA support as well as policy-based loans. \n21 Government Financial Management and Revenue Administration Project approved in December 2004  \n \n ", "    25 \nV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n79.  Technical assistance estimated to cost a total $1,500,000 equivalent, of which $700,000 \nwill be financed from the ADB Technical Assistance Special Fund and $500,000 equivalent will \nbe provided from the Financial Sector Development Partnership Fund22 on a grant basis and will \nbe administered by ADB. The TA will focus on supporting Bapepam-LK in its capacity building \nprogram  over  the  medium  term.  Details  of  the  proposed  scope  and  implementation \narrangements are in Appendix 7. \n \nVI.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Benefits \n \n80.  The  Program  supports  the  Government\u2019s  development  agenda  to  establish  the \nIndonesian capital market as a resilient and competitive market that supports higher growth for \nthe national economy. The Program will provide a policy framework that encourages financial \ninnovation in terms of new instruments and tenors, and new kinds of intermediation. It will \nenhance information disclosure and facilitate price discovery, thus improving the efficiency with \nwhich  financial  markets  price  risk.  This  will help  to  create  deeper  and  more  liquid capital \nmarkets. At the same time, CMDPC will promote stronger intermediaries that are better able to \nmobilize and allocate resources and risks. Better market surveillance and investor protection will \npromote stability and resilience and are essential for capital market development. Together with \nbroader economic reforms in Indonesia, the reform of capital markets will thus contribute to \nproductivity growth, employment generation, and financial sector stability. \n \nB.  Social and Environmental Safeguards \n \n81.  The Program will not entail any involuntary resettlement or have a negative impact on \nindigenous people or the environment. It is classified as category C for involuntary resettlement, \nimpact  on  indigenous  people,  and  impact  on  environment.  The  Program  is  a  general \nintervention aimed at supporting sustainable economic growth and in that respect is expected to \nhave an indirect positive effect on poverty reduction.  Appendix 8 contains the summary poverty \nand social impact analysis and Appendix 9 the environmental impact analysis. \n \nC.  Risks  \n \n82.  While mitigation measures have been put in place for some of the key risks anticipated \nduring program implementation, subprogram 1 still faces some risks.  \n \n83.  Sustaining Reforms. The financial and operational autonomy of Bapepam-LK, which is \ncritical for its effective supervision of the nonbank financial sector, will need an appropriate \nregulatory  framework.  Reforms  being  undertaken  by  the  Government  may  be  opposed  by \nvested or competing interests. The public and parliament will need to be persuaded of the \nlonger-term benefits of reforms that have upfront costs. The consolidation of reform initiatives in \nrecent years and the commitment by the Government and a strong parliamentary coalition to \ncontinue with reforms should ensure Indonesia is on the path to growth and poverty reduction.  \n \n                                                 \n22  Contributor: Government of Luxembourg.  \n ", "26   \n84.  Governance  and  Capacity  Constraints.  Unless  institutional  and  human  capacity \nbuilding takes place within Bapepam-LK, there may be delays in implementing reforms. TA \nsupport  will  help  address  these  capacity  weaknesses  and  the  Government  has  agreed  to \ncommit, through its normal budgetary processes, appropriate provisions for human development \nto sustain capacity building efforts over the medium and long term. ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and \nProgram  (2006\u22122009)  envisages  enhancing  governance  and  reducing  opportunities  for \ncorruption through its lending and TA operations. ADB has provided support for anticorruption \nmeasures, including procurement reforms, during the last 7 years and a number of ongoing \nloan-funded activities have an anticorruption and capacity-building focus. ADB has also actively \nsupported the Partnership for Governance Reform\u2014a cooperative relationship between the \nGovernment,  civil  society,  the  private  sector  and  international  development  partners  on \ngovernance reform. The Financial System Stability Forum which began operations in June 2007 \nwill provide a platform for exchanging information and ideas, and for coordinating the regulatory \nand  supervisory  activities  of  Bank  Indonesia,  Bapepam-LK,  and  the  Lembaga  Penjamin \nSimpanan, the three member regulatory agencies. Successful implementation of the CMMP \nwith the support of the Program should strengthen the capacity and authority of Bapepam-LK in \nregulating and ensuring good governance in the nonbank financial market.  \n \n85.  Lack  of  Commitment  and  Accountability.  Lack  of  accountability,  measurable \noutcomes,  industry  commitment,  and  tactical  planning mean  that  the  CMMP  may  run  into \nimplementation difficulties. There are differences of views among stakeholders that will need to \nbe resolved if policy reforms are to progress. However, progress is likely at present in view of \nthe strong Government commitment to reform. The reform program is made more tractable by a \nphased plan for the implementation of well-defined measures over the next 4 years, in line with \nthe  Government\u2019s  CMMP  as  well  as  its  financial  sector  policy  package.  In  addition,  the \nestablishment of the internal compliance bureau in December 2006 and the revised code of \nethics will strengthen governance and accountability within Bapepam-LK. \n  \n86.  Enforcement  Constraints.  Bapepam-LK  may  have  difficulty  implementing  its \ncompliance  and  enforcement  mandate  effectively.  The  Program  will  help  to  strengthen  its \ninvestigation  strategies  and  enforcement  skills  through  clearly  defined  capacity-building \nprograms within Bapepam-LK. \n  \n87.  Exogenous Shocks. Exogenous shocks to the economy that adversely affect growth \nprospects and threaten macroeconomic stability are a risk to the achievement of program \noutcomes. There is also the risk of a slow down in the global economy and of a disorderly \nunwinding of global macroeconomic imbalances.  However, overall, the economy\u2019s vulnerability \nto external shocks has been decreasing, primarily because of sound debt and macroeconomic \nmanagement. Indonesia\u2019s ratio of total external debt to GDP fell from 49.3% in 2005 to under \n37% in 2006. The Program, in conjunction with additional reform programs financed by ADB, \nand the DPSP being financed by the World Bank and the Government of Japan, will help to \nsustain the economy\u2019s growth path while reducing the risks of macroeconomic instability. \n \nVII.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n88.  In addition to the implementation of the actions specified in the policy matrix and to the \nstandard assurances, the Government has given the following specific assurances, which are \nincorporated in the Loan Agreement. \n \n ", "    27 \n(i)  Continuity and coordination of reforms. The Government will carry out the \npolicies and actions in accordance with the schedule of policy reforms contained \nin  the  policy  matrix  and  ensure  sustainability  of  the  reforms  beyond  the \nsubprogram 1 period. \n \n(ii)  Policy dialogue. The Government will keep ADB informed of (a) the progress \nmade in carrying out the TA attached to the program cluster from time to time, \nand (b) the policy discussions with other multilateral and bilateral agencies that \nhave implications for implementation of subprogram 1 and will provide ADB with \nan opportunity to comment on any resulting policy proposals. The Government \nwill take ADB\u2019s views into consideration before finalizing and implementing any \nsuch proposals. \n \n(iii)  Counterpart  funds.  The Government will use the local currency counterpart \nfunds  generated  by  the  loan  proceeds  to  meet  program  expenditures  and \nassociated costs of reform and additional budgetary allocation for development \nspending.  \n \nB.  Conditions for Program Loan Effectiveness \n \n89.  The Government will have accomplished all subprogram 1 tranche release conditions. It \nwill have established the program coordinating committee, which will be chaired by Bapepam-LK \nwith representatives from the DMO, DOT, Menneg BUMN, Bappenas, and the Financial System \nStability Forum. \n \nVIII.

Regional  Comparison.  In  terms  of  composition  and  growth,  Indonesia\u2019s  financial \nsystem has not progressed compared with those of its neighbors. In 2005 Indonesia\u2019s banking \nassets as a percentage of GDP were 49.8%, equity market capitalization was 28.9%, and bonds \noutstanding were 19.6%, much lower than Hong Kong, China; Republic of Korea; Malaysia; and \nSingapore (Table A2.1). Corporate bonds were a very small percentage of the overall bonds \noutstanding in these economies, including Indonesia.  Although the Indonesian capital market \nhas been the best performing in the region and equity market capitalization has tripled in recent \nyears (37.6% in 2006), issues of breadth and depth of the market and enforcement of regulation \nand supervision remain to be addressed. The long-term debt market has been constrained by \ndelays in pension and insurance sector reforms. Much liquidity is locked up in government \nbonds.   \n \nTable A2.1: Financial Systems in Selected Asian Economies \n(% of gross domestic product) \n \n  Banks Assets  Equity Market Capitalization  Bonds Outstanding \nEconomy  1997  2004  2005  1997  2004  2005  1997  2004  2005 \nPRC  124.6  176.4  163.1  11.2  23.1  17.8  12.9  24.9  24.4 \nHong Kong,                   \nChina  205.1  337.5  444.6  234.5  519.5  593.6  26.0  46.3  46.6 \nIndonesia  31.1  14.6  49.8  12.2  28.8  28.9  1.9  22.6  19.6 \nRepublic of                   \nKorea  37.9  130.1  93.5  8.1  57.1  91.2  25.2  83.3  76.2 \nMalaysia  100.9  169.0  159.4  93.2  153.3  138.0  57.0  90.0  88.0 \nPhilippines  56.1  66.5  63.2  37.7  33.0  40.4  22.4  28.4  36.7 \nSingapore  122.0  176.8  185.4  110.8  202.3  220.4  24.7  73.1  68.2 \nThailand  79.7  129.2  103.6  15.1  71.4  70.1  7.1  41.1  40.8 \n   \nPRC = People\u2019s Republic of China. \nSources: International Monetary Fund, International Financial Statistics; Bank for International Settlements; Asian \nDevelopment Bank, Asian Bonds Online; and Ghosh, Swati R. 2006.

Indonesia\u2019s investment to GDP ratio of 21.3 % in 2006 was low compared with ratios in \nother economies in the region, although the International Monetary Fund has projected that it \nwill rise to 26.2% by 2009.   \n \n3.  Banking Institutions in Indonesia. The financial sector is dominated by banks, which \naccount for about 80% of the sector\u2019s assets. However, although the nonbank financial sector \nas a percentage of GDP is small, it is poised to grow. There are 130 banks: 5 state-owned \nbanks, 72 private banks, 11 foreign banks (100% foreign ownership), 26 regional banks, and 16 \njoint venture banks. The regulators plan to reduce the number of banks to about 80 through \nmergers. One proposal is a minimum capital requirement of Rp100 billion by 2010. In 2006, \nseven small banks were bought by foreign banks. The profitability of Indonesia\u2019s banks, as \nmeasured by the rate of return on assets, has improved since the Asian financial crisis. The \nreturn on assets was estimated to be 2.6% at the end of 2005\u2014up from negative 18% in 1998. \nMuch of this improvement in profitability occurred during 2002\u20132004. The capital base of banks \nremains strong, with average capital adequacy ratios of 19.3% at the end of 2005.  \n \n \n \n \n ", "34  Appendix 2 \nTable A2.2: Health of the Indonesian Banking Sector  \n(%) \n \n  1997  1998  1999  2000  2001  2002  2003  2004  2005 \nNonperforming loan \nratio  7.2  48.6  32.9  18.8  12.1  7.5  6.8  6.2  7.6 \nRate of return on \nassets  1.4  (18.8)  (6.1)  1.6  1.5  2.0  2.6  3.5  2.6 \nCapital adequacy \nratio  9.1  (15.7)  (8.1)  2.1  18.9  22.4  19.4  19.4  19.3 \n \nSource:  Bank Indonesia. \n \n4.  Deposit Insurance. To restore public confidence in the banking sector following the \nfinancial meltdown in 1997, the Indonesian government was compelled to pursue a blanket \nguarantee program. Under this program, all deposits at banks are insured. Indonesia now has a \nDeposit Insurance Institution (LPS). Parliament enacted Deposit Insurance Law 24/2004 on  \n22  September  2004  which  stipulates  that  the  Deposit  Insurance  Institution  has  two  core \nfunctions: (i) to guarantee customer deposits, and (ii) to resolve failing banks. The Deposit \nInsurance Institution carries out a limited and explicit deposit insurance scheme, under which \ndeposits are currently insured up to Rp100 million. \n \n5.  Nonbank Financial Subsector. The nonbank financial subsector still accounts for a \nrelatively low 20% of total financial assets. The sector includes mutual funds (also known as \ninvestment companies), insurance companies, pension funds, securities brokers and dealers, \npawnshops, rural institutions, and venture capital companies.  In line with Indonesia\u2019s long-term \ndevelopment agenda and development priorities, the Government considers development of the \nnonbank financial sector to be an urgent policy imperative. At present, however, Indonesian \ninstitutional investors are relatively small and not yet a source of long-term capital. Indonesia\u2019s \npension funds and insurance companies invest a significant portion of their resources in short-\nterm bank deposits. \n \nTable A2.3: Structure of the Financial Sector  \n \nType of Institution and Year  Assets (Rp trillion)  % of Assets  % of GDP \nBanks (2005)  1470.0  79.7  49.8 \nNonbank Financial Institutions  374.5  20.3  13.7 \nFinance Companies (2005)  67.7  3.7  2.5 \nInsurance Companies (2005)  75.1  4.1  2.8 \nPension Funds (2004) (including both public       \nand private)  107.1  5.8  4.7 \nSecurities Firms (2004)  10.1  0.1  0.4 \nPawn Shops (2005)  4.8  0.3  0.2 \nRural Institutions (2004)  14.7  0.8  0.6 \nMutual Funds (2005)  29.4  1.6  1.1 \nVenture Capital Companies (2005)  2.7  0.1  0.1 \nOutstanding Corporate Bonds (2005)  62.8  3.4  2.3 \nTotal  1844.5  100  67.6 \nEquity Market Capitalization (2005)  801.0  \u2014  28.9 \nEquity Market Capitalization (2006)  1249.1  \u2014  37.4 \n\u2014 = not available. \nSource:  Bapepam-LK. \n \n6.  Insurance.  Insurance  premiums,  particularly  life  insurance,  grew  rapidly  before  the \ncrisis. However, the insurance industry suffered heavily from the rupiah devaluation. Unlike in \n ", "  Appendix 2  35 \nbanking, there have not been large-scale corporate failures among insurers, mainly because \nregulations required insurers to hold a high proportion of their funds in bank deposits. The \ninsurance industry in Indonesia is small and premiums are only 1.8% of GDP (1.18% in life and \n0.62% in general insurance). As of August 2006, there were 51 life insurance companies, 97 \ngeneral  insurance  companies  and  4  reinsurance  companies.  In  addition,  two  companies \nadministered social security and three managed civil servants and armed forces insurance. The \nindustry is heavily concentrated, with the top five general insurance companies accounting for \n51% of general insurance assets and the top five life insurance companies accounting for 55% \nof life insurance assets. The licenses of 8 companies\u2014five life and three general insurance \ncompanies were withdrawn in 2006. The Government is still to address the remaining one state \nlife and two insolvent general insurance companies. Insurance companies currently invest an \nestimated 25% of their assets in short-term deposits.  \n \n7.  To enable insurers to meet increased capital requirements, the Government now allows \nforeigners to own up to 99% of listed insurance companies. The insurance industry must be \nconsolidated  into  fewer  but  stronger  companies.  Policy  holders  must  be  protected  and \nstandards raised in anticipation of reductions to barriers to entry with equal treatment under \nfreer trade agreements. There is also a need to increase the quality of professional services to \nthe  pension  and  insurance  industry,  especially  actuaries  and  accountants  but  also  asset \nmanagers. Quality is a prerequisite to a shift toward risk-based supervision.  \n   \nTable A2.4: Ownership Structure of the Insurance Industry, 1985 and 2005 \n \nLife Insurance  General Insurance \nIndicator  Companies  Companies  Reinsurance \n  1985  2005  1985  2005  1985  2005 \nNumber of Companies           21          51          67          97           4           4 \n% of Total Assets: \n     State           41            7          61          14         99           \u2014 \n     Joint Venture            \u2014          49          14          16           \u2014           \u2014 \n     Private           59          44          25          70     \nAssets (Rp billion)         409   53,940        512   21,206       263       978 \n\u2014 = not available. \nSource: Bapepam-LK. \n \n8.  Pensions. In Indonesia, the pension sector is small, controlling less than 4.7% of GDP \nin  assets,  compared  with  Thailand  (8.4%),  Malaysia  (57%),  and  Australia  (75%).  As  of \n31 December 2006, there were 297 private pension funds in Indonesia with net assets of \nRp69.17 trillion covering privately-managed employer pension funds and financial institution \npension funds. Investments totalled Rp66.59 trillion. Only 12% of the workforce is covered by \npublic pension and old-age savings programs, provided by PT Jamsostek for private sector \nworkers, by PT Taspen for civil servants, and by PT Asabri for the military. Less than 2% of the \nworkforce is covered by voluntary private pensions. The number of employers using financial \ninstitution pension funds more than tripled over the past 5 years. The Private Pensions Law \n11/1992 will be reviewed and amendments will be submitted together with the amendments \nproposed to the Capital Market Law and the Insurance Law. Since 1987, 100 pension funds, \nmainly defined-benefit employer pension plans, have been liquidated and few new funds are \nbeing created. The main impediments are: (i) private pensions have to compete with other \nfinancial products, such as mutual funds and insurance, which are more flexible (allowing for \nearly  withdrawals)  and  have  better  tax  regimes;  (ii)  private  pension  savings  have  to  be \nconverted into annuities with unattractive rates upon retirement age; (iii) although taxation of  \nprivate pensions is theoretically an exempt-exempt-taxable (EET) regime, in practice this is not \nthe case; (iv) the investment regulations do not meet international standards; (v) potential \n ", "36  Appendix 2 \ncontributors may not have enough funds for voluntary contributions for private pensions after \ncompulsory contributions to public pensions and related labor law provisions have been met. \n \n9.  The uncertainties that prevent the growth of the pension industry need to be resolved \ntogether with the uncertain implementation of Law 40 on the National Social Security System \nand debates around the funding of benefits under Law 13 of 2003 on Labor. Bapepam-LK is \nundertaking steps to improve the private pension industry, in particular to increase risk-based \nsupervision. \n \n10.  Equity  Market.  In  2006  there  was  a  sharp  increase  in  market  capitalization  to \n$139 billion but Indonesia remains the fourth smallest market in the Asia and Pacific region \n(only New Zealand, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka are smaller). The top 5% of companies in \nIndonesia represented 67% of market value and 68% of turnover (the averages for developing \nAsian markets are 61% of market value and 50% of turnover). \n \n11.  Rights  of  minority  shareholders  are  not  well  protected  and  standards  of  corporate \ngovernance remain low. Liquidity is limited by the size of the market. The turnover of domestic \ncompany shares in 2006 was $48 billion\u2014less than $200 million per day. However many \ndeveloping Asian markets are relatively illiquid\u20142006 turnover in Malaysia was only $75 billion, \nin Thailand it was $101 billion, and in the Philippines $11 billion. Indonesia\u2019s turnover velocity of \n35% in 2006 is comparable with many other markets. The amount of capital raised is small, with \nthe Jakarta Stock Exchange (JSX) raising $985 million in 2005\u2014$363 million from initial public \nofferings (IPOs). JSX also operates a second tier market, the development board, to provide a \nplatform for small and medium-sized enterprises and new companies. At the end of 2005 there \nwere 125 exchange member securities companies. This is a large number\u2014Malaysia had 38 \nand Thailand 49\u2014and most do not make a profit given the small size of the market. Bapepam \nimposed more stringent capital requirements in 2004 which reduced the number of firms but the \nnumber still seems excessive.  \n \nTable A2.5: Summary of Jakarta Stock Exchange Operations \n \nIndicator  1999  2000  2001  2002  2003  2004  2005  2006  2007 a \nEquity Market                     \nCapitalization (Rp trillion)  451.8  259.6  239.2  268.4  460.4  680.0  801.3    1,249.1  1,422.8 \nTrading Volumes (billion                    \nshares)  178.5  134.5  148.4  171.2  234.0  411.8   401.9    429.5  357.4 \nTrading Value (Rp trillion)  147.9  122.8    97.5   120.8  125.4  247.0    406.0    440.0  328.8 \nJakarta Composite Index  676.9  416.3   392.0   424.9   691.9  1,000.2  1,162.6  1,805.5  2,055.4 \nEquity Market                        \nCapitalization to GDP (%)   37.2  18.7   14.2    14.4  22.6   28.9     28.9   37.4 \nListed Companies   277  287      316     331     353     331      336     344       340 \nNo. of New Issuers      21        31       22         6       12          8       12           1 \nNo. of Trades (\u2019000)        3,092  2,953  3,724   4,012  4,811    4,046 \nTotal Funds Raised (Rp                   \ntrillion)    8.58  14.06  6.34  9.66  16.38  4.32 \na As of 30 May 2007. \nSource: Jakarta Stock Exchange. 2007. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  37 \nTable A2.6: Valuation of Selected Asian Bourses \n \nIndex  Location  Price a  P/E b  Estimated \nP/E \nSHSE-SZSE300  People\u2019s  20,041.1  30.90  29.61 \nIND  Republic of \nChina \nHang Seng  Hongkong,  20,310.2      14.85  15.85 \nChina \nBSE Sensex 30   India  13,961.4      25.55  20.50 \nJakarta Composite  Indonesia    1,836.5      25.53  18.82 \nNikkei 225  Japan  17,225.8      37.02  43.16 \nKuala Lumpur  Malaysia   1,096.2      17.35  16.68 \nComposite \nPSEI  Philippines  2,976.9      15.72  16.81 \nStraits Times  Singapore  2,985.8      14.44  16.30 \nKospi Index  Republic of  1,435.3      12.21  14.39 \nKorea \nSET  Thailand     679.8       9.40  10.94 \nP/E = price to earnings ratio.      \na Closing price, as of 2 January 2007. \nb 2006 \nSource: Bloomberg. \n \n12.

Fixed  Income  Market.  The  Indonesia  bond  market  remains  small  and  illiquid. \nGovernment bonds represented about 13.3% of GDP (at the end of 2006) and corporate bonds \nabout 1.9%\u2014low by the standards of neighboring countries. Bonds offered to the public must be \nlisted on the Surabaya Stock Exchange (SSX). Issuance of government bonds is by auction. \nBanks are the main holders of government bonds, with about three quarters of the total by \nvalue. Retail investors are largely absent. Trading of government bonds is increasing, but \ncorporate bond trading averages only Rp316 billion per day. The SSX provides trading systems \nfor bonds but these are little used and most trading is over the counter. A system of primary \ndealers has recently been established and they are expected to provide two-way quotes. There \nis a requirement to report trades to the SSX and trade details are published. \n \n15.  Government  securities  trades  are  settled  electronically  through  Bank  Indonesia\u2019s \nscripless securities settlement system, which offers delivery versus payment settlement through \nlinks to the real time gross settlement system. Bank Indonesia\u2019s scripless securities settlement \nsystem is also used for the auctions of government bonds. Bapepam-LK is the primary regulator \nof bond issuance and trading, but the securities exchanges are responsible for monitoring the \nactivities  of  their  members.  The  inter  dealer  market  association  for  government  securities \n(Himdasun) has self-regulatory responsibilities and is the custodian of the transaction data \nreported by its members. Listed bonds are required to have a rating at issue but are now \nrequired to maintain their annual rating.  \n \n16.  The Debt Management Office issued its inaugural treasury bills for 12 months tenor in \nJune 2007. The target tenors of issuance are 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months \nsecurities.

Collective Investments. The mutual fund industry has been in the spotlight in recent \nyears because of the tremendous growth in the number of funds focusing on government \nbonds. The major players include alliances from the recapitalized banks who transferred their \nrecapitalized  bond  holdings  to  mutual  fund  subsidiary  companies  and  began  aggressively \nselling units similar to deposit products. There were 104 licensed investment management \ncompanies at the end of 2005 but only 74 were active. At the end of 2005, Bapepam-LK had \nlicensed 19 custodians but only 13 were active. The laws and regulations governing these \ninvestments are not clear\u2014they apply mainly to corporate funds which are rare in Indonesia. As \na result, features that are important in contractual funds, such as the role of the custodian, are \nnot properly covered. Sales agents are largely unregulated, and similar products issued by \ninsurance companies are subject to different regulations. Bapepam-LK has tried to address \n ", "  Appendix 2  39 \nsome of these issues by issuing new rules, but in future regulation and supervision need to be \nbrought in line with international standards. Nevertheless, mutual funds remain an important \nsavings vehicle for individuals and institutions. \n \nTable A2.10: Mutual Fund Industry in Indonesia, 1996\u20132006 \n \nNo. of \nUnit  Net Asset Value  Number of Outstanding \nYear  Investment \nHolders   (Rp billion)  Units \nFunds \n1996  25  2,441   2,782,322.50  2,942,232,210.52 \n1997  77  20,234   4,916,604.80  6,007,373,758.55 \n1998  81  15,482   2,992,171.40  3,680,892,097.26 \n1999  81  24,127   4,974,105.00  4,349,952,950.82 \n2000  94         39,487   5,515,954.10  5,006,049,769.66 \n2001  108         51,723   8,003,769.80  7,303,771,880.36 \n2002  131        125,820   46,613,833.20  41,665,523,049.21 \n2003  186        171,712   69,477,719.80  60,020,745,572.82 \n2004  247        299,063   104,037,824.60  84,700,701,702.71 \n2005  328        254,660   29,405,730.00  21,262,143,379.98 \n2006  403  202,991        516,200,744.00  \u2014 \nSource: BAPEPAM reports. \n \n18.  Developing Sharia-based Capital Market Products.  At the end of 2006, there were \n20 sharia investment funds (5% of the total number of investment funds in Indonesia) with a \ntotal net asset value of Rp664 billion (1.3% of the total and 18.7% more than in 2005). JSX \nlaunched  the  Jakarta  Islamic  Index  on  3  July  2000,  consisting  of  30  shares  which  are \nconsidered to meet sharia principles. At the end of December 2006, the market capitalization \nvalue of the index reached Rp620 trillion or 50% of JSX\u2019s total market capitalization value. The \ntrading volume of the stocks listed in the Jakarta Islamic Index at the end of 2006 was 940 \nmillion shares (25% of the total JSX volume), while the trading value was Rp1,243 billion (46% \nof the total JSX value). The Government plans to issue a new sharia bond called \u201csukuks\u201d once \nthe draft bill on sharia-based instruments that was submitted to the parliament in February 2007 \nis approved. Issues related to value-added tax are under consideration by the Directorate of \nTaxes.  \n \n19.  Market Infrastructure. JSX and SSX are mutual in structure. JSX was established in \n1912 and SSX in 1987. JSX is the recognized for stock listing and trading, whereas SSX is \nmainly for listing and trading of bonds and derivative products. The Capital Market Master Plan \n(2000\u20132004) requires brokers to insure against losses, but this is not being adhered to. There is \nno fund to compensate investors in the event of broker failure. Clearing and settlement is \nperformed by Indonesian Clearing and Guarantee Corporation (KPEI), owned 90% by JSX and \n10% by SSX. This self-regulatory organization (SRO) was established in August 1996. Since \n2001, it has been providing securities lending and borrowing services to help clearing parties \nmeet their temporary needs and prevent failure of transaction settlements. Indonesian Central \nSecurities Depository (KSEI) is a nonprofit SRO which performs depository and settlement \nfunction. KSEI was founded in December 1997. The three SROs (JSX, SSX, and KPEI) own \n16.5% of KSEI shares, 9 custodian banks own 36%, 31 securities companies own 33.5%, 4 \nregistrars own 4%, and the remaining 10% is kept in the form of treasury stock. KSEI\u2019s main \nrole  is  to  facilitate  central  securities  depository  requirements,  including  the  deposition  of \nsecurities that are either traded on Indonesian stock exchanges or over-the-counter, and the \n ", "40  Appendix 2 \nmanagement of securities accounts owned by securities companies and custodian banks in \nKSEI\u2019s system.  \n \nTable A2.11: Market Intermediaries \n \nInstitutions  Number \nStock Exchanges  2 \nClearing Guarantee Corporation  1 \nCentral Securities and Depositories  1 \nSecurities Company  125 \nSupporting Institution  32 \nSupporting Profession  2,695 \nInvestment Advisor/Credit Rating Company  18 \nSource: BAPEPAM-LK. 2006. \n \n20.  Other  Products  and  Services. These include (i) exchange traded funds, (ii) asset \nbacked securities (although no company has issued such securities since regulations were \nintroduced), (iii) single stock futures, and (iv) stock lending and borrowing. A presidential decree \non secondary mortgage financing was issued in February 2005 establishing the Secondary \nMortgage Corporation (PT Sarana Multigriya Finansial). Its function is to purchase qualified \nmortgages from financial institutions and issue bonds backed by these assets. The target \nmarket for these mortgage-backed securities will be long-term investors, such as insurance \ncompanies and pension funds. It is expected that, during PT SMF\u2019s first 3 years of operations, it \nwill lend to financial institutions, which will on-lend for qualifying mortgages, in order to build up \na critical mass of primary mortgage receivables.

Efforts will be concentrated on reforms to strengthen price \ninformation and discovery through bond trade reporting and on moving towards real time price \ninformation. This will be facilitated by the establishment of a bond pricing agency, expected by \n2008. Subprogram 2 will enable prompt public disclosure of changes in beneficial ownership \nbeyond 5% in the shareholding of any listed company. Secondary market liquidity will be further \nenhanced  through  better  coordination  between  Bapepam-LK  and  Bank  Indonesia,  wider \nacceptance of the repurchase agreement, development of a centralized borrowing and lending \nprogram for government bonds, revised rules on short selling and margin trading, issuance of \nshort-term T-bills of various maturities extended up to 1 year, market-making obligations being \ncarried out by the primary dealers,  and increased float and supply of securities through the \nprivatization  of  selected  state-owned  enterprises.  New  products  such  as  sharia-compliant \ngovernment bonds (sukuks), municipal bonds, hedging instruments such as stock options and \nindex-based options, and asset-backed securities will be developed and issued during the \nprogram period.   \n \n2.  Insurance companies will be allowed to hold a more diversified services portfolio. The \npossibility  of  allowing  the  pension  industry  to  invest  in  foreign  assets  will  be  examined. \nProposed  amendments  to  the  Capital  Market  Law  designed  to  demutualize  the  merged \nexchanges  will  be  submitted  to  parliament.  Amendments  to  the  tax  laws  to  address  tax \ndisincentives for financial instruments will also be considered by the parliament. \n \n3.  Market  surveillance  and  investor  protection  will  be  enhanced  under  subprogram  2 \nthrough  the  implementation  of  the  regulatory  framework  proposing  greater  financial  and \noperational autonomy to Bapepam-LK. In parallel, proposed amendments to the Capital Market, \nInsurance  and  Pension  Laws  designed  to  achieve  greater  compliance  with  international \nstandards will also be submitted to parliament for approval. Legal immunity will be provided to \nthe staff of Bapepam-LK through these amendments. International cooperation will be enhanced \nwhen  Bapepam-LK  develops  and  implements  the  International  Organization  of  Securities \nCommissions  (IOSCO)  MOU  action  plan.  Bapepam-LK  will  also  develop  centralized \nenforcement  functions  over  all  nonbank  financial  institutions  and  organize  an  enforcement \nbureau along functional lines. Risk-based parameters and minimum capital requirements will be \nreviewed  and  updated  in  line  with  international  standards  for  the  insurance  industry.  The \npension  industry  will  also  move  towards  a  risk-based  approach  to  supervision.  Investor \nprotection will be enhanced through an implementation plan for a securities market investor \nprotection  fund.  Provisions  governing  conflict  of  interest  will  be  strengthened  through  the \nproposed amendments to the Capital Market Law. Rules for using the new bond pricing agency \nquotes as the benchmark for valuation and pricing of collective investment schemes and units \nwill be issued under subprogram 2.

To support implementation of the Capital Market Development Program Cluster, the \nRepublic  of  Indonesia  asked  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  provide  technical \nassistance (TA). A TA grant of $700,000 is included in the 2007 assistance program under \nADB\u2019s country strategy and program 2006\u201320091 for Indonesia. This will be supplemented by \ncofinancing  support  equivalent  to  not  more  than  $500,000  from  the  Financial  Sector \nDevelopment Partnership Fund (FSDP)2 on a grant basis. \n \nB.  Background and Issues \n \n2.  Capital Markets Supervisory Agency (Bapepam-LK). Financial sector regulation and \nsupervision are under the authority of two supervisory authorities. Banks are regulated and \nsupervised by the central bank, Bank Indonesia. The Capital Markets Supervisory Agency \n(Bapepam)  was  established  in  1976  under  Presidential  Decree  No.  52/1976  and  given \nresponsibility for the regulation and day-to-day supervision of capital markets in Indonesia. \nBapepam is accountable to and reports to the Minister of Finance.  The Ministry of Finance is \nresponsible for development of high-level policy matters, with Bapepam having reasonable \nautonomy in relation to the conduct of investigations, inspections and other regulatory functions. \nIn addition to Bapepam's role in regulating capital markets, the Commodities Futures Trading \nRegulatory Agency is responsible for regulating and supervising commodity futures trading and \nreports to the Minister of Trade. \n \n3.  In 2004, the Ministry of Finance prepared an action plan to improve the regulation and \nsupervision of the nonbank financial sector. The insurance, pension, finance, and venture-\ncapital companies were regulated by the Directorate General of Financial Institutions (DGFI) in \nthe Ministry of Finance until 2005, when a presidential decree merging Bapepam and DGFI was \npassed. The merger of Bapepam and the DGFI into Bapepam-LK and the endorsement of a \nplan  for  continued  improvements  in  the  regulatory  and  supervisory  structure  of  the  newly \ncreated merged agency were a significant step toward strengthening supervision of financial \nservices in the nonbank sector. The legal and regulatory framework for supervision will also be \nimproved through amendments to the Capital Market, Pension and Insurance Laws. To increase \nthe  financial  and  operational  autonomy  of  Bapepam-LK  further  changes  to  the  regulatory \nframework and capacity building will be needed. Bapepam-LK has submitted a proposal to allow \nit to recruit staff directly from the general labor market rather than being limited to a pool of \navailable civil servants. Salaries for Bapepam-LK staff are no longer tied to the general civil \nservice pay scale, allowing the agency to compete more effectively for able recruits and to retain \nthem. The Ministry of Finance has recently approved a tripling of Bapepam-LK salaries. To \ndevelop and motivate these staff, it will be crucial for Bapepam-LK to put in place a well-\ndesigned capacity-building program. \n \n4.  Capacity Building for Capital Market Development.  The Program is predicated upon \nthe development of a modern risk-based, supervision and regulatory framework for the capital \nmarkets  and  contractual  savings  industries.  This  framework  will  stress  investor  protection, \nmarket development, and system stability. This requires staff with graduate level education in \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2006. Country Strategy and Program (2006-2009): Republic of Indonesia. Manila. \n2 Contributor: Government of Luxembourg. Funding to be administered by ADB. \n ", "66  Appendix 7 \nactuarial science and finance and experience in regulatory practices and market surveillance in \ndeveloped  markets.  Acquiring  these  skills is a  pre-condition  for  success  but  a  very  major \nchallenge over the medium term.  \n \n5.  Implementation of the reforms supported under the Program and the extent of their \neffectiveness and sustainability depends not only on the availability of adequate capacity in \nBapepam-LK, but also within capital market self regulatory organizations (SROs), and in the \nindustry in general.  Many of the skills required for effective regulation and supervision of capital \nmarkets (as well as effective compliance) are highly specialized and require significant on-the-\njob and advanced formal training.   \n \n6.  In the short term, capacity-building support will be provided to Bapepam-LK under this \nassociated TA. However, this support needs to be complemented by a medium- to long-term \ninitiative to build up a critical mass of staff with relevant skills in Bapepam-LK and the industry in \ngeneral.  This should include support for: (i) scholarships for staff from Bapepam-LK and other \ncapital  market  institutions  for  advanced  degrees  or  other  forms  of  training,  and  (ii)  the \nestablishment of local institutions focused on applied research and training tailored to the needs \nof  Bapepam-LK  and  other  capital  market-related  institutions  as  well  as  to  industry  more \ngenerally. \n \n7.  The importance of this capacity-building initiative is recognized by both the Government \nand  the industry  and  discussions have  been underway  for  some  time  among  government \nagencies, industry associations, and local universities.3  The Program aims to support these \nefforts and lend momentum to them via the associated TA which will help meet immediate \nneeds and allow for a systematic approach to medium- and longer-term efforts.  \n \n8.  The Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID) is shortly to implement a \ntechnical assistance project under which change management and human resources experts \nwill be engaged to help Bapepam-LK develop its human resources department and plans to \nmove towards a more functional approach to regulation. This project is expected to complement \npolicy actions within Bapepam-LK and to identify additional training requirements.  \n \n9.  The TA associated with the Program will address immediate and short-term capacity-\nbuilding  needs  and  complement  the  change  management  assistance  being  provided  by \nAusAID. The Government has agreed to commit, through its normal budgetary processes, \nappropriate provisions for human development to sustain capacity building over the medium to \nlong term.4 \n \nC.  The Technical Assistance \n \n10.  The TA will draw upon the findings of a human resources skills audit conducted by \nBapepam-LK. It will provide capacity-building support in five main areas: \n \n(i)  establishment of a database and improvements to basic applied research skills in \nBapepam-LK\u2019s newly established research bureau; \n                                                 \n3  For example, MOF has proposed the establishment of a Capital Markets Institute within the University of Indonesia. \n4  A study was carried out under a previous TA project to broadly define a medium-term capacity-building program, \nincluding the cost of carrying out the above exercise (ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to the Government of \nIndonesia for Establishing a Financial Services Authority. Manila).  \n \n ", "  Appendix 7  67 \n(ii)  external  on-the-job  training  for  Bapepam-LK  staff  through  secondments  with \nregulators in other jurisdictions;  \n(iii)  short courses by local training institutions in collaboration with outside experts to \ndevelop the market surveillance and regulatory skills of Bapepam-LK staff; \n(iv)  curricula for training programs and standards for certification for professionals in \nfields  related  to  capital  markets  (e.g.,  actuaries  for  general  insurance  and \nsurveillance training for SRO staff); and \n(v)  an econometric model and related capacity to improve understanding of the \nvulnerabilities in the nonbank financial sector by the Financial System Stability \nForum.  \n \n11.  The TA will also provide focused support for the implementation of selected reforms \nunder the Program. \n \nD.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost a total $1,500,000 equivalent, of which ADB will provide \n$700,000 to be financed from the ADB Technical Assistance Special Fund. A further $500,000 \nequivalent will be provided from the Financial Sector Development Partnership Fund on a grant \nbasis and will be administered by ADB. The Government will provide the remaining $300,000 \nequivalent by providing counterpart staff and other support facilities (Table A7). \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  Bapepam-LK will be the executing agency for the TA and the research bureau will serve \nas the main focal point. Bapepam-LK will provide office space, counterpart staff, and other \nservices to the consultants. It will closely coordinate with other stakeholders involved in TA \nimplementation. A capital markets capacity-building committee comprising representatives from \nBapepam-LK and the MOF will be established to provide guidance on the allocation and use of \ntraining-related  funds  under  the  TA.  In  collaboration  with  the  consultants  and  the  local \nuniversities, the committee will help to develop curricula for training programs and standards for \ncertification  for  professionals  in  capital  market-related  fields  and  will  select  degree  and/or \ntraining programs and candidates that qualify for scholarship support. A project coordinator will \nprovide  general  administrative  support  for  TA  implementation  and  will  be  responsible  for \noverseeing the implementation of training programs in collaboration with the consultants and the \ncapital markets capacity-building committee. The TA will be implemented over 24 months and is \nexpected to commence in February 2008 and to be completed by January 2010.  \n \n14.  The  TA  will  involve  a  combination  of  international  and  national  consultants  to  be \nengaged in response to requirements that will be identified during the course of implementation \nof the capacity-building exercise. It is expected that this will include: 28 person-months of \ninternational consultancy services focused on capital-market-related capacity building, course \ndevelopment, and establishment of professional standards and certification; and 24 person-\nmonths of domestic consultancy services focused on developing a database and basic applied \nresearch skills within Bapepam-LK\u2019s newly established research bureau.  Consultants will be \nengaged on an individual basis in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time), and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the \nengagement  of  domestic  consultants.  Outline  terms  of  reference  will  be  developed  in \nconsultation with relevant government counterparts. All consultants will submit an inception \nreport detailing their draft work plan and schedule within 1 week of fielding and provide concise, \nregular updates to Bapepam-LK and ADB outlining progress and identifying implementation \n ", "68  Appendix 7 \nissues.  Where  appropriate,  midterm,  draft  final,  and  final  reports  will  also  be  submitted \naccording to a schedule agreed with Bapepam-LK and ADB. All services, equipment, and \nmaterial to support implementation of the TA will be procured by direct purchase in accordance \nwith ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Equipment will \ninclude  computer  hardware  and  software  related  to  the  database  for  Bapepam-LK.  All \nequipment procured under the TA will be handed over to Bapepam-LK upon completion of the \nTA. Bapepam-LK will provide for dissemination of relevant TA outputs though its website. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 7  69 \nTable A7: Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n($'000) \n \n  Total \nItem  Cost \nA.

One of the five priority areas is achieving macroeconomic stability with fiscal sustainability and financial sector \nreforms. In addition, recognizing that macroeconomic and sector reforms will be vital to attracting greater private \nsector investments, the Government has begun to articulate a short- and medium-term reform agenda in the financial \nsector. Indonesia\u2019s capital market master plan (2005\u20132009), and the Government\u2019s annual financial sector policy \npackage (2006 and 2007) are geared toward increasing the credibility and integrity of the Indonesian financial sector \nand enhancing the effectiveness of the regulation and supervision of the financial services in Indonesia. Stronger \npublic finances will enable increases in social expenditure and investments.

Introduction \n \n1.  The proposed Capital Market Development Program Cluster supports the Government\u2019s \nreform agenda for the financial sector, with a focus on development of capital markets. The \npolicy measures include a set of reforms to promote the diversification of financial channels by \nenhancing the growth and development of the capital markets. The Program is a program \ncluster with two subprograms. Subprogram 2 is expected to be ready for Asian Development \nBank  (ADB)  Board  consideration  about  18  months  after  subprogram  1.  This environmental \nassessment report examines the environmental impacts of the policy component of the Program. \n \nB.  Description of the Policy Interventions \n \n2.  The reform agenda is structured around the following policy outcomes, which form the \nbasis of four components for the proposed Program: \n \n(i)  enhancing information disclosure and price discovery, \n(ii)  promoting deeper and more liquid financial markets, \n(iii)  improving market surveillance and investor protection, and \n(iv)  strengthening governance and human resource capacity. \n \n3.  The Program is embedded in the Government\u2019s medium-term reform agenda and the \ntwo-tranche structure will provide the Government with the flexibility to adjust the program and \nits speed of implementation according to country developments. \n \nTable A9: Environmental Assessment of the Policy Interventions \n \nPolicy Area  Economic and Social  Environmental  Mitigation \nOutcome  Impact  Measures \n1.
