INTRODUCTION\n1. During the 1994 Country Programming Mission, the Government of Mongolia\nrequested the Bank to provide a technical assistance (TA) grant to assist the improvement of\nMongolia's accounting and auditing systems. The Government's request arose from its\nrecognition of the importance of an efficient, transparent and internationally recognized system\nof accounting and auditing to facilitate the country's transition towards a market economy. At\nthe request of the Government, a TA Fact-finding Mission visited Mongolia between 18-24 March\n1995 and reached an understanding with the Government on the TA's objectives, cost estimates,\nimplementation arrangements and the terms of reference for the consultants.1\nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\nA.\t Background\n2. In its transition from a centrally planned economy to a market economy, Mongolia\nhas opened several sectors of its economy to increased domestic and foreign private investment.\nThe Government of Mongolia has recognized the importance to potential investors of timely,\nreliable, and accurate information about the financial condition of enterprises being opened to\nprivate investment. Such information is not available under Mongolia's present accounting and\nauditing system.\n3. Mongolia's existing accounting and auditing system was designed to provide\ninformation necessary for the operation of a centrally planned economy. In such a system, state\nagencies were the only users of accounting information. The prime function of accounting was\nto monitor and control the use of economic resources to meet planned targets. This system of\naccounting differed substantially from International Accounting Standards in the treatment of (I)\nmatching costs to revenues, (ii) valuation of assets, and (iii) computation of the cost of\nproduction. Auditing in a centrally planned economy was limited to an inspection function.\nSince enterprises were wholly state-owned and their creditors were also the state or other state-\nowned enterprises, the need for independent financial control and reporting was never\nappreciated. Mongolia's accounting and auditing systems are inappropriate to the needs of a\nmarket economy. The country's movement in this direction without commensurate changes in\nits accounting and financial control policies and reporting structures have created grey areas in\nthe country's regulatory framework, which has enabled financial improprieties to occur in the\ncountry's enterprises. The Government is aware of the inadequacies of its existing accounting\nand auditing systems and clearly recognizes the need to integrate Mongolia's accounting and\nauditing systems with globally recognized standards.\n4. In this direction, the Mongolian Parliament passed the Accounting Law of Mongolia\nin 1993. This law mandates business enterprises (i) to adopt International Accounting Standards\npromulgated by the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC) of the International\nFederation of Accountants and (ii) to submit to the Ministry of Finance (MOF) audited quarterly\nfinancial statements and reports using a uniform IASC format prescribed by the Ministry. MOF\nhas since adopted this format. The implementation of this format is scheduled to become\neffective in 1995, and by 1996, all the financial statements of Mongolian companies submitted\nto MOF will conform to its revised reporting format. However, no audit law is in force in\nMongolia.\nThe TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities in July 1994.", "2\n5. Mongolia has three accounting associations: (i) the Accounting Council (with 26\nmembers), (ii) the National Association of Certified Public Accountants (with a membership of\n200 associate unlicensed accountants), and (iii) the Union of Finance Specialists' Association\n(comprising accountant members employed by MOF). Under the provisions of the country's\nAccounting Law, and MOF in consultation with the Accounting Council is responsible for\nimplementing all accounting and auditing systems reforms.\n6. Business enterprises have not complied fully with the 1993 Accounting Law\nbecause of (i) insufficient knowledge by enterprise accountants of International Accounting and\nAuditing Standards and (ii) the absence of a competent professional body of accountants to\naudit the accounts of enterprises using such standards. These two factors are also responsible\nfor the problems that executing agencies of Bank-financed projects face, in complying with loan\ncovenants requiring the timely submission of adequately prepared and prudently audited\nfinancial statements.\nB.\t Rationale\n7. The integration of Mongolia's accounting and auditing systems with internationally\nrecognized standards is necessary to provide factual information about its enterprises to\nprospective investors and to their current owners. These measures constitute an integral part\nof the country's industrial, legal and financial sector reforms, the promotion of which forms a core\npart of the Bank's strategic objectives for the country. In this direction, the Bank has provided\nMongolia several advisory and operational TAs for strengthening the country's industrial and\nfinancial sectors.1\n8. The World Bank provided Mongolia a TA in 19932 whose activities helped achieve\nthe (i) development of a curriculum for accountancy education, (ii) codification of a draft\ncommercial law, and (iii) basic introduction of international accounting standards in three\nMongolian enterprises.3 The Bank's TA complements the objectives of the World Bank's TA and\nis a continuation of the Bank's support for the country's legal, industrial and financial sector\nreforms.\nThese are (I) TA 1 855-MON:lnstitutional Strengthening of the Financial Sector for $595,000 approved on 17\nMarch 1993, (ii) TA 1929-MON:Strengthening of the Industrial Sector for $545,000 approved on 17 August\n1993, (iii) TA 1 930-MON:Deve/oping Mongolia's Legal Framework for $500,000 approved on 17 August 1993.\n(iv) TA 1 989-MONAssistance to the State Privatization Commission for $490,000 approved on 22 November\n1993, (v) TA 2102-MON Accounting and Management Information Systems and Tariff Reform  for $599,000\napproved on 16 June 1994, and (vi) TA 221 9-MON:Strengthening of the Commercial Banking System for\n$600,000 approved on 5 December 1994.\nThis was IDF Grant No. 28740-MON: Accountancy and Commercial Law Development for $357,500 approved\non 25 February 1993.\nThese were (I) the Gobi Cashmere Factory, (ii) the Arkhi Beer Factory, and (iii) the Trade and Deve'opment\nBank.", "3\nIll. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objectives and Scope\n9. The main objectives of the TA are to (i) assist in the conversion of Mongolia's\naccounting and auditing systems established under the centrally planned economy to generally\naccepted international accounting and auditing standards, (ii) assist in the adoption of such\naccounting and auditing practices by all business enterprises in the country, (iii) assist in\nestablishing a professional accounting body and regulations for entry into the profession, (iv)\nassist the Government in drafting an audit law, and (v) provide a training program to train local\naccountants in the use of such accounting and auditing standards1.\n10. The TA will seek to train accounting staff from the following organizations to use\ninternational accounting and auditing standards: (i) business enterprises; (ii) Securities and\nExchange Commission; (iii) State Privatization Commission; (iv) Accounting Council; (v) Ministry\nof Finance; and (vi) other agencies and institutions selected by the Government for this purpose.\nAn appropriate fee will be charged by MOF to participants from the private sector attending the\ntraining courses. This group of trainees should be large enough to form a critical mass for the\ndissemination and practice of International Accounting Standards in Mongolia.\nB.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n11. The total cost of the Project is estimated at $615,000 comprising $600,000 in\nforeign exchange costs and $15,000 equivalent in local currency costs (see Appendix 1). The\nBank will finance $600,000, comprising the entire foreign exchange cost. The TA will be charged\nto the Bank-funded TA program. The Government will finance the local currency cost of $15,000.\nC.\t Implementation Arrangements\n12. The TA will be implemented over a 12-month period commencing January 1996,\nto facilitate review and inputs from the Working Group, MOF, and the Accounting Council. A firm\nwill be engaged to provide a team of three consultants from the accounting profession with\nsubstantive experience and expertise in International Accounting and Auditing Standards and\nin the accounting and auditing standards prevalent in centrally planned economies. The team\nwill provide a total of 18 person-months of consultancy (the team leader will provide 12 person-\nmonths of consultancy and the other two members would provide 3 person-months each).\nDuring this period, the team will (i) prepare manuals detailing the methodology for converting\nMongolia's accounting and auditing systems to international standards; (ii) conduct training\nprograms on a participatory basis (using real case studies) to introduce such a process; (iii)\nsuggest guidelines for the establishment of a professional accounting body and for regulating\nentry into the profession; and (iv) suggest measures to the Mongolian Government for drafting\nand implementing the country's proposed audit law (see Appendix 2 for detailed terms of\nreference for the consultants). All consultants will be recruited by the Bank in accordance with\nthe Bank's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The consultants will be assisted on a full-time\nThe training program will make use of the accounting education curriculum developed under the\nWorld Bank's TA.\n- -----.- f-lz f-l L-T -J-f-I  .1- L-J- \tii II I 1\t rirl-r\t ir'i i #r.r%rIl?I.,\t I.\t --- ---.--.--- .-. ..-\t u\t JLJl i,L ,\t1\t Vi\u00e8lI\tliv\t , TiT", "4\nbasis by counterpart staff provided by the Government and consisting of people already\nemployed as accountants in the country.\n13.
