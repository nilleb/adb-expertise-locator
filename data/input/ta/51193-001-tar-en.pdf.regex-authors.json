INTRODUCTION \n1.  The proposed knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) is designed to strengthen \nthe capacity of national statistics offices (NSOs) in Asia and the Pacific to meet the increasing \ndata demands for policy making and monitoring of development goals and targets. It will focus on \nthree important areas:1 (i) subnational disaggregation of the Sustainable Development Goals \n(SDGs),2 (ii) enhanced compilation of national accounts and other key economic indicators, and \n(iii) provision of strategic inputs for the modernization of national statistical systems (NSSs) to \ninform policy design and statistical capacity-building initiatives of the global statistical system.  \n \n2.  The proposed TA, which is part of the approved 2017 work plan of the Economic Research \nand Regional Cooperation Department (ERCD) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB),3 is linked \nto the Cape Town Global Action Plan for Sustainable Development Data and draft framework of \nADB\u2019s Strategy 2030.4 Strategy 2030\u2019s strategic business areas section includes \u201csupporting \nSDGs\u201d as a priority under social sector operations.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) set forth specific, time-bound, and quantified \ntargets. The MDGs (i) were useful in assessing how economies of the world fared in addressing \nextreme  poverty  in  its  many  dimensions;  and  (ii)  helped  focus  development  efforts  and \ninterventions on countries that fell short of specific development targets, resulting in significant \ngains in most parts of the world. However, the widening gap between the rich and poor in many \ncountries suggests that some socioeconomically vulnerable groups have not experienced such \ngains. With the goal of ending all forms of poverty, the SDGs aim to build on the success of the \nMDGs by promoting development among vulnerable groups. \n \n4.  Although the data collected for MDG monitoring allowed tracking of how countries fared \nin terms of different social and economic indicators relative to other countries, they provided \nlimited empirical evidence on which segments of a country\u2019s population experienced significant \nprogress or lagged in terms of the MDGs. This is problematic because there are limited data to \nguide the design of intervention programs meant to appropriately target the socioeconomically \nvulnerable. In response, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development has pledged that \u201cno one \nwill be left behind\u201d, calling for the development of SDG indicators for different subpopulation \ngroups  based  on  income  class,  gender,  ethnicity,  geographic  location,  and  other  relevant \ndimensions. Quality, accessible, timely, and reliable disaggregated data are needed to identify \nsubgroups of the population that were left out with respect to specific SDG targets. \n \n5.  In addition to indicators included in the SDG, more disaggregated data on economic \ntransactions  by  industry  and  product  are  needed  to  better  understand  the  production, \nconsumption, and trade structures of a globalizing world. Compilation of such disaggregated \neconomic indicators requires regular estimation (following the 2008 System of National Accounts) \n                                                \n1  United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD). 2017.

NSOs and other public entities play a critical role in the production and dissemination of \nofficial statistics. The statistics are usually compiled using conventional sources, including sample \nsurveys, censuses, and administrative sources. The rise of innovative data sources such as big \ndata allows for more inclusive and networked problem solving.7  However, many DMC NSOs \nrequire critical and specific TA in developing or enhancing technical skills and infrastructure for \nproducing and disseminating data using conventional and innovative sources. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: improved data monitoring for evidence-based \npolicy  making  and  public  sector  management.  The  TA  will  have  the  following  outcome: \nstrengthened capacity of NSOs to provide relevant disaggregated data for policy design and \ntargeted interventions to support vulnerable groups.8  \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n8.  Output 1:  Technical manual on disaggregation of official statistics, knowledge- \nsharing workshops, and case studies on various applications of innovative data analytics \nfor disaggregation of select Sustainable Development Goal indicators. The TA will facilitate \na series of strategically designed training workshops and course modules on disaggregation of \nofficial statistics and SDG indicators targeted to NSOs of about 10 DMCs. Initially, the project \nteam will prepare a manual that will take stock of various methods of small area estimation (SAE).9 \nThe manual will also cover (i) ways of using innovative data sources, e.g.,  satellite images, mobile \ndata, or social media data to produce disaggregated data for official statistics; and (ii) relevant \nissues related to the use of these data.10 The project team will use the results of these activities \nto carefully design the conferences, training workshops and course modules. Lastly, two country \ncase studies on a specific policy-relevant issue showcasing specific applications of SAE and \ninnovative data analytics to disaggregate select SDG indicators will be prepared. \n \n9.  Output  2:  Targeted  knowledge-sharing  workshops  and  training  on  enhanced \ncompilation of national accounts and other economic indicators. The project team will \n                                                \n6  The System of National Accounts refers to the internationally agreed standard set of recommendations on how to \ncompile various measures of economic activity. The supply and use table is a statistical table that summarizes the \nrelationship between inputs, outputs, product supply, and demand across different economic sectors. (UNSD. 2018. \nSystem of National Accounts 2008. New York. https://unstats.un.org/unsd/nationalaccount/sna2008.asp)  \n7  Big data generally refer to the type of data arising from people\u2019s digital transactions with computers, social media, \nmobile phones, photos, satellite images, sensors, and other types of digital technology. \n8  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n9  SAE is a class of statistical techniques that are designed to provide reliable estimates of specific characteristics of \nsubpopulation groups with small sample sizes in surveys. \n10 Existing applications of big data are useful in disaggregating official statistics that are traditionally produced using \nconventional data. For example, daytime satellite images of houses\u2019 roofs have been used to estimate village-level \npoverty rates in African countries. In other countries, satellite images of nighttime lights have been used to estimate \nthe magnitude of economic activity (e.g., gross domestic product) and population size at more granular levels. Mobile \nphone records have been used to derive local-level estimates of migration and access to financial services.    \n ", "3 \n \nprovide technical training programs on compiling and analyzing components of the national \naccounts that are critical to the sustainability and development of the economic statistical systems \nof selected DMCs. The project team will provide training programs and knowledge-sharing \nworkshops to NSO staff on (i) instituting and operationalizing statistical business registers (the \nspecialized infrastructure required for the production and analysis of multisourced economic data \nfeeding into national accounts); (ii) producing high-quality statistics and analysis on economies\u2019 \nparticipation in international production-sharing arrangements or global value chains; and (iii) \ndeveloping a suite of (a) innovative socioeconomic data compilation and analysis frameworks \ncomprised of extended supply and use tables, (b) extended input\u2013output tables, and (c) social \naccounting matrixes, which facilitate static and dynamic analysis and impact and policy analysis \nof the economy and its interaction with the environment and society. \n \n10.  Output 3: High-level regional conference and workshops in preparation for the \nupdating of the Handbook of Statistical Organizations. The TA will finance a conference \nand/or other workshops to be organized for high-level dialogues with senior management of \nselected NSOs in Asia and the Pacific and leading experts on thematic areas such as (i) quality, \ncommunication, and partnership; (ii) statistical architecture for an integrated production system; \n(iii) information technology; (iv) capacity building; and (v) resource mobilization relevant to the \noperation and organization of NSSs. Similar conferences and workshops are planned in other \nregions of the world, which will be supported by other regional and international agencies. The \nthematic conferences will serve as forums for in-depth discussions and provide comprehensive \ninputs to the updating of the Handbook of Statistical Organizations, which will be undertaken by \nthe United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD).11 \n \n11.  Output 4: Working paper and/or policy notes identifying other methodological and \nsubstantive  areas  where  developing  member  countries\u2019  national  statistical  systems\u2019 \ncapacity needs to be strengthened. Modernizing NSSs will entail numerous enhancements to \nthe existing operational framework of NSOs and other government agencies with data collection \nfunctions. The first three outputs of this TA will address only a few of the immediate priorities of \nDMC NSOs, so commitment from international development organizations to strengthen the \ncapacity of NSSs is imperative. The TA presents an opportunity to explore how ADB can facilitate \ncontinued engagement and collaborative statistical work with NSOs in Asia and the Pacific. \n \nC.   Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix \n2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  ADB, through its Development Economics and Indicators Division (ERDI) of the ERCD, \nwill be the executing agency for this TA. ERDI will work closely with relevant ADB departments, \nincluding the (i) Department of External Relations regarding workshops and trainings and the \npublication of knowledge products; (ii) Office of Information Systems and Technology regarding \nprocurement of equipment, software, and other needs of the TA related to information technology; \n                                                \n11 The updating of the Handbook (which outlines the general principles of the operation and organization of a statistical \nagency) and conferences for NSO senior staff are in line with the United Nations Statistical Commission\u2019s strategies \nin relation to the provision of strategic guidance to (i) achieve more modern, integrated, and coordinated NSSs; and \n(ii) ensure that there is a standards-based architecture that allows for more effective response to the SDGs\u2019 data \nrequirements.  \n ", "4 \n(iii) Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department; (iv) Strategy, Policy and Review \nDepartment (as focal point of the SDGs) regarding TA activities to promote synergy with existing \nSDG-related initiatives of other ADB departments with other regional and international agencies; \nand (v) regional departments. \n \nTable 1: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nIndicative  September 2017\u2013March 2021 \nimplementation period \nExecuting agency  ADB \nImplementing agency  ERDI and select NSOsa \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \nInternational consultant for small area  3 person-months  $43,000 \nestimation \nInternational consultant for big data  3 person-months  $43,000 \nInternational consultant for regional  1 person-month  $31,000 \nconferences and workshops \n  International manuscript editor  1 person-month  $10,500 \n  National economists or statisticians   35 person-months  $147,000 \n  National research analysts  114 person-months  $200,000 \n  Resource persons  1 person-month  $10,500 \nProcurement  To be procured by ADB following ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended \n  from time to time). \nSingle source (direct contracting)  2 contractsb  $20,000 \nShopping  4 contractsb  $35,000 \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ERDI = Development Economics and Indicators Division, NSO = national statistics \noffice, TA = technical assistance. \na NSOs will be the main implementing agencies of the country-specific studies described under output 1 and activities \ndescribed under output 2. For all other activities, ERDI will be the implementing agency.  \nb The number of contracts is estimated. Contracts can take the form of a written agreement or data\u2013user agreement \nbetween ADB and selected NSOs of participating developing member countries and other private entities. ADB\u2019s \nOffice of Information Systems and Technology will be consulted on the procurement of equipment and/or software. \nSource: ADB. \n \n14.  ERDI will implement all activities relating to knowledge-sharing workshops, training, and \npreparation of technical reports under the TA while the NSOs will be the national implementing \nagencies for all country-specific case studies under output 1 and activities under output 2.12 No \nactivity will be financed in any participating DMC unless a no-objection letter is obtained from the \nDMC government.13 The project team will undertake the overall implementation of activities under \n                                                \n12 The project team will explore possible collaboration with experts from Pulse Lab Jakarta, Statistics Korea, UN Global \nPulse, United Nations Development Programme, UNSD, UNESCAP, the World Bank, and other development \npartners. Specifically, the project team may invite experts from these agencies as resource persons. The project \nteam will also explore the possibility of joint publications with these organizations. If this planned collaboration were \nto evolve into a knowledge partnership, the staff instruction on business processes for knowledge partnerships under \nTA operations will be followed. \n13 In addition to no-objection letters, ADB and the participating DMCs will sign a framework of partnership, which is a \nnonlegal yet formal document that outlines the detailed roles and responsibilities of ADB and participating DMCs, \nand the schedule of key milestones and activities. A draft framework of partnership will be provided to ADB\u2019s Office \nof the General Counsel and other relevant departments for review prior to signing by both parties. For output 1, the \nchoice of NSOs will based on the following criteria: NSO should (i) be currently developing SDG data compilation \nframework, which identifies disaggregation of select SDG indicators as one of its core priorities; (ii) have access to \nrelevant micro-level records of survey, census, administrative data, and/or a specific type of innovative data source \nthat are either publicly accessible or can be made accessible to the TA; and (iii) have a dedicated pool of staff who \ncan be trained in the use of SAE techniques and innovative data sources, and who preferably have experience on \nrelated initiatives such as poverty mapping. The same set of criteria applies to the selection of NSOs for output 2. \n ", "5 \n \noutput 3 in close collaboration with the UNSD, which is responsible for updating the Handbook of \nStatistical Organizations, and with regional partners such as the United Nations Economic and \nSocial Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP), and countries in the region.14 The project \nteam will implement all TA activities from September 2017 to March 2021.  \n \n15.  Under outputs 1 and 2, each participating economy that will conduct country-specific case \nstudies will be required to identify a national coordinator who will be responsible for implementing \nthe scheduled activities at the country level in accordance with the approved schedule of activities. \nThe ADB project team will undertake periodic reviews of progress and necessary interventions in \nthe form of technical and operational advice that will be provided on an ongoing basis. The ADB \nproject team will also conduct biannual workshops with project staff of all participating economies \nto review progress of data collection, methodological development, and identification of data \nquality issues. \n  \n16.  Consulting services. The TA will finance 157 person-months of consulting services (8 \nperson-months international and 149 person-months national) and one person-month of resource \nperson inputs. ADB will engage the consultants on an individual basis in accordance with the \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time).15 Lump sum \npayments and output-based contracts will be considered for consulting services.  \n \n17.
