I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Central Asia \nRegional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Corridor Development Investment Program. \n2.  The investment program will enhance regional connectivity and trade in CAREC corridors \nin  Pakistan  by  improving  road  traffic  efficiency  along  CAREC  corridors.  Specifically,  the \ninvestment program will rehabilitate and upgrade the road network of 747 km constituting the \nCAREC corridors mainly in Sindh, Punjab, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.1 \nII.  THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Background. Located at the crossroads of Afghanistan, Central Asia, the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC), India, and Iran, Pakistan has huge potential to become a regional \ntransport and trade hub. It can maximize its national capabilities and resources to support trade-\nbased economic growth mainly by playing the role of a transit trade hub. However, transit trade \nthrough Pakistan is still limited while trade remains maritime-centric, aligned with the southern \ngateway port of Karachi, and focused on major global developed markets like North America, \nEurope, and the Middle East. Poor transport and border cross-point infrastructure and costly \ntransport and cross-border services pose an obstacle to exploiting the untapped potential. \n4.  Pakistan is putting its effort toward more land-based regional trade with neighboring \ncountries  through  participation  in  regional  programs.  In  2011,  Pakistan  joined  the  CAREC \nProgram.  Pakistan\u2019s  transport  corridors  offer  the  shortest  route  to  the  sea  for  landlocked \nAfghanistan, Central Asia, and the PRC\u2019s Xinjiang province. Pakistan\u2019s accession to CAREC \nenables subregions in Asia and Europe to be virtually integrated and seamlessly connected from \nEast Asia through South Asia and Central Asia to Europe. In 2013, the CAREC transport corridors \nwere extended to Pakistan to provide Afghanistan, Central Asia, and the PRC with connection to \nthe ports of Gwadar and Karachi on the Arabian Sea. CAREC Corridor 5, extended to Pakistan \nalong N55, links PRC and Afghanistan to the Arabian Sea and provides the PRC\u2019s Xinjiang \nprovince and landlocked countries in Central Asia the shortest trade route through the Karachi \nPort. Improving CAREC Corridor 5 along N55 in Pakistan will enable Pakistan to realize potential \neconomic benefits from accelerated trade with surrounding countries. The CAREC Transport and \nTrade Facilitation Strategy (TTFS) 2020 endorsed by the CAREC ministers at the 12th ministerial \nconference in 2013 proposes investment projects to build the CAREC corridors in Pakistan.2 \n5.  In 2013, Pakistan and the PRC agreed to develop the China\u2013Pakistan Economic Corridor \n(CPEC) to improve transport and energy infrastructure in Pakistan and enhance trade links \nbetween the two countries. The CPEC will allow Pakistan to maximize its potential as a regional \ntransport and trade hub while enabling the PRC to integrate its western regions and neighboring \ncountries into the Silk Road economic belt initiatives. The synergy between the CAREC corridors \nand the CPEC could enable Pakistan to play the role of a regional transport and trade hub.  \n6.  Sector performance. Transport contributes 10% to Pakistan\u2019s gross domestic product \nand more than 6% to the country\u2019s overall employment in 2013. Upgrading Pakistan\u2019s transport \n                                                \n1  The MFF is included in ADB. 2016. Country Operations Business Plan: Pakistan, 2017\u20132019. Manila. ADB provided \nproject preparatory technical assistance. \n2  ADB. 2014. CAREC Transport and Trade Facilitation Strategy 2020. Manila. \n ", "2 \nsystem  is  critical  to  both  export  competitiveness  and  economic  growth.  Roads  are  the \npredominant mode of transport in Pakistan, accounting for more than 92% of passenger and 96% \nof freight traffic in 2010; total inland traffic by road was estimated at 325 billion passenger-\nkilometers (km) and 59 billion freight ton-km by rail. \n7.  Pakistan\u2019s road network of 263,000 km consists of 12,500 km of national highways and \n93,000 km of provincial highways, with the remainder classified as either district or urban roads. \nThe national highway network, which is less than 5% of the total road network, caters to 80% of \ncommercial traffic. The National Highway Authority (NHA) is responsible for national highways \n(including  access-controlled  motorways  and  expressways),  while  provincial  and  district \nadministrators are responsible for provincial highways and district roads. Despite the high reliance \non road transport, the quality of the road infrastructure severely constrains capacity. Although the \nquality of the national highways considerably improved from continuous investments and better \nroad asset management, the overall condition is wanting\u2014only 50% of highways are assessed \nto be in good or fair condition. The condition of the provincial highways is worse than that of the \nnational highway network. Many are either permanently impassable or subject to closure during \nbad weather. \n8.  Sector road map. The government\u2019s transport sector strategy is highlighted in Vision \n2025, which aims to establish an efficient and integrated transportation system that facilitates the \ndevelopment of a competitive economy.3 Key related targets are to reduce transport costs and \npromote  regional  connectivity  through  enhanced  infrastructure  development  (physical \nconnectivity), effective institutional arrangements (institutional connectivity), and empowered \npeople (people-to-people connectivity). \n9.  Vision 2025\u2019s strategic direction for promoting regional connectivity has evolved into two \nkey regional cooperation and integration initiatives, i.e., the CAREC Program and the CPEC \n(paras. 4\u20135). In line with Vision 2025\u2019s strategic direction, the CAREC TTFS 2020 sets out the \nfollowing operational priorities: (i) development of multimodal corridor network focusing on road \nand  rail  network  development,  logistics  center  development,  and  border  crossing  points \nimprovement; (ii) improvement of trade and border crossing services focusing on coordinated \nborder management, customs modernization, integrated trade facilitation, and single window \ndevelopment; and (iii) improvement of operational and institutional effectiveness focusing on road \nmaintenance, road safety, designated rail corridor, and policies and institutional development. \nTTFS 2020 identifies 23 priority investment projects in Pakistan amounting to $7.7 billion. \n10.  Strategic context. The country partnership strategy 2015\u20132019 for Pakistan highlights \nthe focus on strengthening regional connectivity in transport and energy through ADB support for \n(i) the extension of CAREC corridors to the ports of Gwadar and Karachi, (ii) the Turkmenistan\u2013\nAfghanistan\u2013Pakistan\u2013India natural gas pipeline project, and (iii) transport and trade facilitation \nwith  emphasis  on  developing  economic  corridors  to  expand  economic  opportunities  for \ncommunities  in  surrounding  areas.4 This  strategic  direction  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Regional \nCooperation and Integration Strategy (2006) and the Operational Plan for Regional Cooperation \nand Integration (2016), which aim to strengthen connectivity between economies and raise \ncompetitiveness in connected markets.5 \n                                                \n3  Government of Pakistan. 2014.

Manila. \n ", "3 \n11.  Policy framework. Through institutional capacity development and reforms aided by \ndevelopment partners, NHA has become a capable road agency despite structural constraints. \nIt managed to (i) establish the road maintenance fund and secure a stable source of road \nmaintenance expenditure; (ii) establish the road asset management system, which allows more \nefficient use of scarce resources; and (iii) establish the National Highway and Motorway Police, \nwhich contributes to controlling overloading and reducing traffic violations and accidents on \nmotorways and national highways. Despite these achievements, sector reforms should continue, \nparticularly for (i) establishing a national transport policy together with NHA\u2019s business plan; \n(ii) enhancing the sustainability of road networks and preserving road assets; and (iii) establishing \na national policy for road safety and promoting public awareness. \n12.  National transport policy. A national transport policy is a prerequisite for the effective \ndevelopment of a sustainable and cost-effective transport system. Government efforts to develop \na national transport policy in 2008 failed because of lack of strong ownership from the top; the \ndraft national transport policy was shelved. In 2014, through policy dialogue, government\u2019s \ninterest was revived and in November 2015, ADB approved capacity development technical \nassistance for Enabling Economic Corridors through Sustainable Transport Sector Development \n($15.4 million; financed by the Government of the United Kingdom) to help develop a national \ntransport policy and master plan.6 The government will prepare the national transport policy and \nmake it endorsed by 31 December 2018. \n13.  Sustainability of road network and road assets preservation. In 2003 the government \nestablished a road maintenance fund, which was mainly financed by toll revenue from the \nmotorways and national highways. Securing a stable source of funding for road maintenance \nexpenditures (free from federal fiscal budget allocations that are usually influenced by political \nconsideration) enabled NHA to adequately plan and effectively prioritize maintenance needs in \naccordance with the rankings of the road asset management system. The road maintenance fund \nhas shown a consistent and stable increase each year; however, a huge backlog inherited from \nthe  past  and  exacerbated  by  repeated  heavy  floods  distorts  the  effective  use  of  scarce \nmaintenance funds. To rectify this distortion, NHA plans to reconstruct 1,113 km of roads with \nresidual life less than 2 years through the assistance of development partners including ADB. \n14.  Road safety. Road safety is a serious issue in Pakistan. Inadequate safety design, \ninsufficient attention to safety, and inadequate traffic enforcement and driver training all contribute \nto Pakistan\u2019s poor safety record. In 2016, the government prepared a draft national road safety \nframework and action plan for national highways and motorways. With the support of road safety \nexperts engaged in 2016 under ADB\u2019s technical assistance (footnote 6), the draft framework and \naction plan for national highways and motorways will be expanded to cover the entire road \nnetwork in Pakistan as the National Road Safety Plan. A comprehensive road safety act will be \ndeveloped and a national road safety body will be established to coordinate and monitor the \nimplementation of the National Road Safety Plan. \n15.  NHA\u2019s financial statements. Since NHA was established as a corporate entity, the \ngovernment budgetary support for road investment has been in the form of government loans to \nNHA. The practice leads to severe distortion of NHA\u2019s financial statements, accumulation of \nunserviceable debts and accrued interests in the balance sheet, and a huge net loss in the income \nstatement  because  of  NHA\u2019s  meager  revenues  from  tolling.  With  these  distorted  financial \nstatements,  NHA  cannot  mobilize  funds  from  capital  markets  to  promote  public\u2013private \npartnership.  To  correct  the  distortion,  the  government  will  consider  (i)  equitizing  NHA\u2019s \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2015. Technical Assistance to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for Enabling Economic Corridors through \nSustainable Transport Sector Development. Manila. \n ", "4 \naccumulated debt; (ii) revaluing NHA\u2019s road assets at current prices; and (iii) treating future \ngovernment support to NHA for road investment either as government equity investment or as \nproper financing modalities that NHA can absorb and reflect in its financial statements. \n16.  Development  coordination.  ADB  has  been  the  lead  agency  for  road  subsector \ndevelopment in Pakistan and has coordinated its activities with development partners such as the \nWorld Bank, Japan International Cooperation Agency, and the Department for International \nDevelopment of the United Kingdom. The collaboration of development partners was instrumental \nin overcoming previous constraints on the institutional transformation of NHA from a government \nadministration  to  a  service-oriented  asset  manager  equipped  with  an  effective  road  asset \nmanagement system. As a bilateral development partner, the PRC has taken an active role in \nroad subsector development in Pakistan since 2010. ADB will continue to take the lead in \ncoordinating the different strategies and interests of development partners in Pakistan\u2019s road \nsubsector to synergize resources and maximize their impact. \n17.  Lessons. Since 2005, ADB assistance has focused on trade corridors and regional \nconnectivity to help the government take advantage of its strategic location and act as a hub for \nregional transport. Two MFFs provided in 2005 and 2007 were designed to improve key trade \ncorridors connecting sea ports, industrial centers, and border crossing points.7 Despite the high \nrelevance of the MFF, both MFFs were not implemented as designed and left a considerable \nportion of MFF resources unutilized mainly because (i) NHA\u2019s capacity was not adequate to \nmanage massive land acquisition and resettlement requirements and consequent startup delay \nfollowed; and (ii) security situation was beyond adequate control and cancellation of projects \nresulted in security-sensitive areas. NHA has developed its capacity for land acquisition and \nresettlement and established a standard timeline to complete the cycle of land acquisition and \nresettlement following the Land Acquisition Act. All tranches are designed in such a way that land \nacquisition and resettlement will be completed when contractors are mobilized so that necessary \nproject sites are handed over to the contractors on time. In the process of selecting project roads, \nsecurity risks were thoroughly assessed and security vulnerable areas were avoided. Contractors \nwill be requested to develop a security mitigation and management plan. \n18.  Value added by ADB assistance. Since 1997, ADB has developed the CAREC Program \ninto a premier regional cooperation program with a clear vision anchored on partnership and a \ncomprehensive action plan that defines shared priorities for cooperation. ADB, as the CAREC \nSecretariat,  played  an  instrumental  role  in  defining  CAREC  corridors  in  Pakistan  in  2013. \nFrom its experience in road network development in Pakistan, ADB knows transit traffic flow \npatterns and the network effects the CAREC corridors will create. ADB\u2019s sector road map in \nPakistan will help the country become a regional transport and transit hub in line with the \ndevelopment of the CAREC corridors. ADB\u2019s active involvement in CAREC corridor development \nthrough the proposed MFF will encourage the government to accord high priority in terms of \nallocating national resources to build a seamless regional connectivity among CAREC countries. \n19.  Suitability of financing modality. The MFF is a suitable financing modality that allows \nADB to program its assistance in line with the long-term needs of the government, especially \nsince the sector road map and policy framework including sector reform measures are clearly set \nout in the context of the CAREC Corridor development initiative and the government investment \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2007.

Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n23.  The investment program is estimated to cost $925 million (Table 2). The government has \nrequested an MFF in an amount up to $800 million from ADB's ordinary capital resources to help \n                                                \n8  The government has committed itself to implement sector reform measures derived from policy framework (paras. \n12\u201315) as part of loan covenants and undertakings of the MFF (refer to Schedule 6 of the framework financing \nagreement accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n9  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "6 \nfinance a part of the investment program. The MFF will consist of several tranches, subject to the \ngovernment's submission of related periodic financing requests, execution of the related loan and \nproject agreements for each tranche, and fulfillment of terms and conditions and undertakings set \nforth in the framework financing agreement. The first tranche of the MFF will comprise a regular \nloan of $180 million, have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an annual interest \nrate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per  year,  (the  interest  and  other  charges  during \nconstruction to be capitalized in the loan,) and such other terms and conditions set forth in the \ndraft loan and project agreements. Based on the custom-tailored method, the average maturity is \n15.97 years, and the maturity premium payable to ADB is 0.10% per year.  \nTable 2: Summary Cost Estimates ($ million) \nItem  Tranche 1  Tranche 2  Tranche 3  Totala \nA.

Climate adaptation is estimated to cost $14.5 million and ADB will finance 92% of such \ncost (para. 29). \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n26.  NHA will be the executing agency. A steering committee presided by the NHA chair will \nbe  responsible  for  monitoring  the  use  of  loan  funds  and  for  the  overall  implementation \nperformance of the investment program. A project implementation unit will be established under \nNHA  for  overall  implementation  of  construction,  including  supervision  of  contractors  and \nsupervision consultants. A general manager will head the unit, which will have suitably qualified \nstaff including project directors and safeguard specialists. \n27.  Procurement of civil works and related services financed under the investment program \nwill be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to \n ", "7 \ntime). Consulting services will be required for supervising construction and capacity development. \nConsultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2013, as amended from time to time). \n28.  Advance  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  will  be  pursued  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines to facilitate project implementation. The government has been advised \nthat advance contracting and retroactive financing do not commit ADB to finance the project. \nThe project is categorized as procurement- and design-ready. The implementation arrangements \nare summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the facility administration manual.10 \nTable 4: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  July 2018\u2013December 2027 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2027 \nEstimated loan closing date  30 June 2028 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Steering committee under NHA chair \n(ii)  Executing agency  NHA \nProcurement  International competitive  Tranche 1: Two contracts for building  $149.5 million \nbidding  an additional 2-lane carriageway and \none contract for rehabilitating existing \n4-lane road \nTranches 2 and 3  $585.3 million \nConsulting services  Construction  QCBS  Tranche 1: 67 person-months  $9.0 million \nsupervision  (90:10)  (international) and 346 person-\nmonths (national) \nTranches 2 and 3  $18.0 million \nDue diligence  QCBS  Based on NHA needs assessment \nadvisory services  (90:10)  $10.0 million \nAssistance with  QCBS  Based on NHA needs assessment  $9.0 million \nproject  (90:10) \nimplementation \nAdvance contracting and  Advance contracting and retroactive financing for goods, works, and consulting \nretroactive financing  services.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n29.  For building the additional two-lane carriageway for Petaro\u2013Sehwan and Ratodero\u2013\nShikarpur roads, the carriageway will be 7.3 m wide with 3.0 m outer shoulder and 1.0 m inner \nshoulder with a design speed of 100 km/h, separated from the existing carriageway with concrete \nJersey barriers. The additional carriageway including the shoulders will be benched into the \nexisting  width  and  pavement  layers  constructed  and  compacted  as  per  NHA\u2019s  technical \nspecifications after checking the soil properties of pavement and shoulder. As for rehabilitating \nthe existing four-lane carriageway for Dara Adamkhel\u2013Peshawar road, the existing carriageway \nof 14.6 m wide with 2.0 m outer shoulder and 1.0 m inner shoulder will be upgraded with a design \nspeed of 100 km/h. Climate change risks and adaptation measures were considered in the project \n                                                \n10 Facility Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \ndesign. The road embankment is sufficiently high to withstand flows of highest floods. The design \nprovides adequate cross drainage and hydraulic structures (based on 100-year recurrence \ninterval flood discharges), which were adopted by NHA after the 2010 mega-flood. The impact of \ntemperature  on  asphaltic  pavement  layers  has  been  mitigated  by  adopting  pavement \nspecifications suitable for the climate in the project areas. \nB.  Economic and Financial \n30.  Economic.  An  economic  analysis  of  project  1  was  conducted  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.11 Costs of the project were compared against \nthe benefits of vehicle operating cost savings, travel time savings, and reductions in maintenance \nand operating costs to NHA. The analysis shows that project 1 is highly and economically feasible, \nwith an economic internal rate of return of 24.3% and a net present value of $354.0 million, at a \n9% discount rate. Sensitivity tests reveal that the project is robust against increases in cost and \ndecreases in benefits. However, the project is sensitive to changes in future maintenance regimes, \nhighlighting the importance of timely and appropriate maintenance. \n31.  Financial. The Road Maintenance Fund\u2014a pool of toll revenues, penalties, and other \nfunds provided by the government and established in 2003 through the Road Maintenance \nAccount Rules\u2014is earmarked to finance maintenance of the entire national highway network. \nThe project roads will be maintained under NHA\u2019s annual maintenance plan generated by the \nroad asset management system. The resources generated by the road maintenance fund are \ninsufficient to maintain roads at the quality of newly paved roads with an international roughness \nindex (IRI) of less than 2.0 m/km. With this constraint, NHA aims to maintain roads with an \naverage IRI of 3.5 m/km (current average is 4.0 m/km). \nC.  Governance \n32.  NHA\u2019s capacity for procurement, financial management, and project implementation was \nassessed  and  found  to  be  sufficient  to  manage  international  procurement  and  maintain \naccounting systems, financial controls, and audit arrangements. Its financial accounting, auditing \nrules,  and  internal  control  systems  follow  generally  accepted  international  practices. \nNHA maintains separate project records and accounts adequate to identify the works, goods, and \nservices financed from loan proceeds, financing resources received, expenditures incurred for the \nproject, and use of local funds, as well as adequate internal controls and financial reporting \narrangements. The project accounts and related financial statements will be audited annually in \naccordance with national and international auditing standards by the auditor general of Pakistan \nand by a chartered accountant. \n33.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and NHA. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the FAM (footnote 10). \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n34.  The Pakistan Economic Survey 2015\u20132016 reports the latest headcount multidimensional \npoverty incidence at 38.8% for 2015, with a disparity of 9.43% (urban) and 54.6% (rural). Poverty \nis unequally distributed across the four provinces of Pakistan and between rural and urban \npopulations. The multidimensional poverty incidence for Punjab province is 31.5%, followed by \nSindh with 43.2%, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with 49.1%, and Balochistan with 71%.12 Areas with \n                                                \n11 ADB. 2017.

Factors that affect the livelihood of the poor include (i) low literacy; (ii) lack of access \nto employment opportunity; and (iii) exclusion from benefit of development projects. The main \ndirect beneficiaries of the investment program will be agricultural traders, freight forwarders, \ntransporters, commuters, and those living and working along the project road sections. Indirect \nbeneficiaries  include  large  sectors  of the  population  who  will  gain from more  employment \nopportunities in trade and transport business and ready access to markets and resources across \nthe country. The local population will get employment opportunities during the construction and \noperation phases of projects. Women will benefit through improved access to basic social \nservices such as health, education, and social networking facilities. Additional assistance to \nhouseholds  headed  by  women  will  be  provided  as  part  of  the  resettlement  plan.  During \nimplementation, more gender elements fit for project site situations will be devised and included \nin construction contracts. \nE.  Safeguards \n35.  Resettlement. A land acquisition and resettlement framework for the investment program \nand two draft land acquisition and resettlement plans for tranche 1 project have been prepared \nbased on census and inventory of losses. Although most works will generally follow the available \nright-of-way limits, additional land will be needed to provide the required vertical and horizontal \ngeometrical improvements for certain sections and to build the 2.32 km bypass near Dakkan in \nRatodero\u2013Shikarpur road. A total of 512,737.1 m2 of agricultural land and 1,618.8 m2 of residential \nand commercial land will be acquired. Around 356 households (with 2,411 members) will be \naffected.  Of  these,  548  persons  will  experience  significant  resettlement  impacts,  of  which \n412 persons will be physically displaced while 136 persons will lose 10% or more of their \nproductive assets. For the rehabilitation of the 34 km Dara Adamkhel\u2013Peshawar road, no \ninvoluntary resettlement impact is anticipated as all works will be limited to the existing right-of-\nway and will not impact on any existing fixed structure within the right-of-way. The draft plans will \nbe updated based on the detailed design. Project 1 is classified category A for involuntary \nresettlement and category C for indigenous peoples safeguards. \n36.  Environment. Project 1 is classified category B for environment. An environmental \nassessment and review framework and draft initial environmental examinations were prepared \nand disclosed on the ADB website. The project roads do not cross or are not located near \nprotected areas. The environmental assessment established that the project can have site-\nspecific environmental impacts related to air and water pollution, noise and vibration, loss of \nroadside trees, and traffic disruptions during construction. Because of construction of additional \nlanes and increase in traffic, the project can split communities and disrupt farming patterns. \nAdequate mitigation measures will be included in and implemented through an environmental \nmanagement plan. The project design will incorporate measures for preserving community \ncohesion such as improved crossings (underpasses and overpasses) and access to public \nfacilities. Public consultations were conducted in October\u2013November 2016. Overall responsibility \nfor the implementation of the plan will rest with contractors. NHA's project implementation unit will \nhire  an  environmental  and  social  officer  to  supervise  the  implementation  of  the  project\u2019s \nenvironmental safeguards. \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n37.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5 and described in \ndetail  in  the  risk  assessment  and risk  management  plan.13 The risks are  assessed  to  be \n                                                \n13 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nmanageable once mitigating measures are adopted, and the integrated benefits and impacts are \nexpected to outweigh the costs of mitigation. \nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nWeak financing  The practice of providing loans to NHA to finance its development program since its creation in \narrangements on  1991 undermines the authority\u2019s financial standing.

ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n38.  The government and NHA have given ADB certain undertakings for the MFF, which are \nset forth in the framework financing agreement. Specific covenants agreed by the government \nand NHA with respect to individual tranches under the MFF are set forth in the loan agreement \nand project agreement for the respective tranches. \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n39.  I am satisfied that the proposed multitranche financing facility would comply with the \nArticles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board \napprove the multitranche financing facility to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Central Asia \nRegional Economic Cooperation Corridor Development Investment Program in an aggregate \nprincipal amount not exceeding the equivalent of $800 million, which comprises the provision of \nloans from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in regular terms, with interest and other terms to be \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility and is subject to such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with \nthose set forth in the framework financing agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n4 September 2017 \n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK FOR THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \nImpact the Investment Program is Aligned with \nRegional connectivity and trade in CAREC corridors enhanced (CAREC Transport and Trade Facilitation Strategy \n2020)a \n  Performance Indicators with Targets  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  and Baselines  Reporting  Risks \nOutcome  By 2027:     \nEfficiency for  a.
