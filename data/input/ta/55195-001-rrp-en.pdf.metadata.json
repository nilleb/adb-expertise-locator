THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans to \nGeorgia for the COVID-19 Vaccine Support Project under the Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility \n(APVAX).  \n \n2.  The project will provide the Government of Georgia with financing for coronavirus disease \n(COVID-19) vaccine procurement and logistics and capacity-strengthening activities through the \nAPVAX.1 The rapid response component (RRC) under the APVAX will be used to support the \nprocurement of Asian Development Bank (ADB)-eligible COVID-19 vaccines, including delivery \nand  related  international  logistics,  handling  fees,  and  insurance.2  The  project  investment \ncomponent (PIC) under the APVAX will help strengthen capacity to implement the vaccination \nprogram and contain COVID-19 transmission and its significant health and socioeconomic impact. \nGeorgia has met all APVAX access criteria (Table 1). \n \nTable 1: Compliance with Access Criteria of the Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility  \nAccess Criteria  ADB Staff Assessment \nDemonstrated  COVID-19 adversely impacted the economy in 2020; GDP declined by 6.2% compared with \nadverse   a 5% growth in 2019.a For FY2021, GDP growth is expected to be 7.7%.

THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n1.  COVID-19 Pandemic \n \n4.  Status of the pandemic. The Government of Georgia reported the country\u2019s first COVID-\n19 case on 26 February 2020, followed by the first wave from September 2020 to February 2021, \nthe second, milder wave beginning in March 2021 and a third wave beginning in June 2021. As \nof 11 August 2021, Georgia had reported 461,198 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 6,230 deaths.5 \nHigher infection rates were recorded in the capital, Tbilisi, and the autonomous Adjara region.6 \nThe peak number of daily new confirmed cases was at 6,208 in August 2021 during the third \nwave, compared with 2,171 during the second wave from March to June 2021.7 According to the \nNational Center for Disease Control and Public Health (NCDC), 36.2% of persons presenting for \npre-hospital  admission  testing  positive  for  COVID-19  did  not  show  symptoms. Most  (56%) \nhospitalizations were mild cases, 35% moderate, 7% severe, and 2% critical.8 The case fatality \nrate of COVID-19 admissions was about 1% (footnote 6). Most fatal cases were elderly persons \nand those with significant comorbidity. \n \n5.   Country context. Georgia is an upper middle-income country (UMIC) in the Caucasus, \nwith a population of 3.7 million in 2021.9 Georgia\u2019s health sector has been highly decentralized \nand extensively privatized by ambitious sector reforms since 2007. The Universal Health Care \nCoverage Program was introduced in 2013 and includes a defined benefits package.10 Georgia\u2019s \nkey health indicators are better than the average for UMICs. For example, immunization rates in \nGeorgia are high, with 99% for measles (93% for UMICs) and 94% for diphtheria-pertussis-\ntetanus (92% for UMICs) in 2019.11 While the number of hospital beds is close to the average for \nUMICs at 2.9 beds per 1,000 people, the government mobilized clinics with 7,000 beds by \nDecember 2020 to augment capacity to treat COVID-19 patients.12 A challenge remains: out-of-\npocket expenditure is relatively high at 47.7% of health expenditure (2018) because of high \noutpatient pharmaceutical costs. \n \n3  The title of the document is Georgia COVID-19 Vaccine National Deployment Plan but it is better known as National \nVaccine Deployment Plan (NVDP) (Georgia. 2021. Georgia COVID-19 Vaccine National Deployment Plan. 8 April). \nADB\u2019s strategic focus in Georgia is agreed in the forthcoming country operations business plan, 2022\u20132024. \n4  ADB. 2018.

Impact of the Pandemic \n \n6.  Cost to the economy. Gross domestic product (GDP) declined by 6.2% in 2020 because \nof the COVID-19 pandemic, compared with 5.0% GDP growth in 2019.13 Global and national \npandemic control measures have resulted in reduced productivity and consumption; an inflow of \nGeorgian migrant laborers from abroad; and increased unemployment, from 17.6% in 2019 to \n18.5% in 2020.14 Adjusted for population increase, per capita income declined from $4,696 in \n2019 to $4,275 in 2020.15 The fiscal deficit increased from 2.1% in 2019 to 9.3% in 2020. COVID-\n19  mitigation  measures  are  largely  financed  from  aid  inflows.  The  public  debt\u2013GDP  ratio \nincreased from 40.4% of GDP in 2019 to 60.0% in 2020 and 60.7% in 2021 but is expected to \nremain sustainable.16 Trade and tourism have been severely affected by COVID-19, with exports \ndeclining by 12.3%, imports by 13.8%, and revenue from tourism by 90.0%. Real GDP growth \nrebounded strongly to 12.7% in the first half of 2021. Growth was broad-based across all sectors \nand  is  expected to  reach  7.7% for  2021.17  Recovery,  gaining  impressive  momentum,  was \nunderpinned by significant support to businesses and households, propped up with sizeable \ndonor support. Strong growth in remittances and exports and faster than expected rebound in \ntourism have supported the economic recovery and helped reduce the current account deficit.  \n \n7.  Impact on poor and vulnerable groups. The poor and vulnerable are disproportionately \naffected by the pandemic. Without interventions to protect the poor through social assistance and \nother interventions, the pandemic would have more than doubled poverty levels.18 The initial \ngovernment response to the pandemic reduced poverty in the short term, but overall it remains \nhigher than before the pandemic.19 In 2020, 21.3% of the population lived below the national \npoverty line (19.5% in 2019), with the rural poverty rate at 27.5% and the urban poverty rate at \n17.1%.20 Absolute poverty, measured using the international poverty line ($1.90 per day), is \nestimated to increase from 3.8% in 2019 to 5.4% in 2020 because of the effects of COVID-19.21 \nThe pandemic\u2019s impact on poverty is significant because of a large number of self-employed and \ninformal sector workers and migrant workers returning home. In addition, the basic cost of living \nfor the poor has increased.  \n \n8.  Impact on gender equality. The NCDC reports that more women (57%) than men (43%) \nhave been infected with COVID-19 (footnote 6). The Georgia National Action Plan on Gender \nEquality draws attention to the needs of about 246,000 internally displaced persons\u201455% of \n \n13 ADB. 2021.

They comprise 6% of the population. \nPoor living conditions increase their risk of exposure to COVID-19.22 Another issue exacerbating \nwomen\u2019s vulnerability to COVID-19 is the reported significant increase in unpaid care work during \nthe pandemic. More women than men reported that the pandemic affected them psychologically. \nHouseholds with children and disabled members, and more women than men, reported higher \nlevels of stress and anxiety. Women carry out most household work, including being the primary \ncare takers of family members with COVID-19.23   \n \n9.  Impact on the health system. Georgia ranks 42nd out of 195 countries in the Global \nHealth Security Index and is better prepared for epidemics and pandemics. Testing capacity \nincreased significantly from 100 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests per day in March 2020 to \n20,000 per day by July 2021. The health sector budget has increased from GEL1.57 billion (9.7% \nof the state budget) in 2020 to GEL2.01 billion (10.3%) in 2021.24 Treatment is free for COVID-19 \npatients. Early data show that the pandemic has affected the health system, particularly routine \nprimary care services. Although the services continued without interruption, their use deteriorated, \nespecially during mobility restrictions. Childhood immunization coverage declined by up to 8% for \nmost vaccines, with a dramatic drop for booster doses (25%\u201330%) in 2020. A twofold reduction \nwas observed for cancer screening.25 Hospital admissions, although reduced during the first \nwave, were not affected.  \n \n10.  Initial  government  measures  to  control  the  pandemic.  In  January  2020,  the \ngovernment approved the COVID-19 national emergency response plan (NERP) and established \nthe Interagency Coordination Council.26 The NERP details core elements and the resource \nrequirements to prevent, detect, and respond to the COVID-19 emergency.27 Georgia\u2019s early \naction during the first global wave gave the country time to prepare the health system for \nincreased COVID-19 cases. The government enacted several measures to control the pandemic \nand strengthen the health system\u2019s capacity, including (i) reducing the risk of transmission by \nrestricting social gathering and closing public institutions and schools; (ii) tightening epidemic \ncontrol through detection, tracing, isolation, and surveillance (e.g., upgrading testing capacity); \n(iii) increasing capacity to treat confirmed cases by expanding hospital bed capacity, health \nworker training, establishment of fever centers, and remote patient management through online \nplatforms; and (iv) risk communication to encourage face-mask wearing, social distancing, among \nothers (footnote 6). In April 2020, the government announced a GEL3.5 billion response program, \nwhich accounted for about 7.4% of GDP.28 In the budget for FY2021, GEL 1.36 billion has been \nallocated for COVID-19 response (footnote 24).  \n \n11.  Lessons learned. The implementation of COVID-19 vaccination to date has shown that \nit must be constantly monitored and adjusted, depending on the availability of vaccines and the \nlatest recommendations.

Following a fatal case early in the vaccination process, the government \nreacted quickly to change service delivery arrangements. Essential health service provision has \nbeen adjusted to new realities at all levels of care to ensure uninterrupted and safe care delivery, \nsuch as by introducing new protocols for infection control and transitioning to online and phone \nservices where possible.  \n \n3.   Government\u2019s Response \n \n12.  Needs assessment. The government has noted that any further escalation of COVID-19 \nwill have a serious health and socioeconomic impact and further delay economic recovery. \nContaining the COVID-19 pandemic with vaccination clearly outweighs the costs, reduces the \nnumber of severe COVID-19 cases, and reduces the burden on the health system while COVID-\n19 treatment is not available. The need for rapid vaccination has become even more pertinent \nwith the emergence of new variants of the virus. The NVDP was originally costed at about $48 \nmillion (maximum), considering the vaccines-mix and costs known during its preparation. ADB \nupdated the cost estimates to about $71.6 million based on more recent information, considering \nan updated vaccines-mix and wastage rate, average price per dose of $13.7, updated service \ndelivery, cold chain logistics, and other costs.29 \n \n13.  National Vaccines Deployment Plan. The NVDP was developed under the leadership \nof the Ministry of Internally Displaced Persons from the Occupied Territories, Labor, Health and \nSocial Affairs (MOILHSA) through eight technical working groups, in consultation with other \nministries and development partners. The NVDP was approved in January 2021 and updated in \nApril 2021.30 The plan builds on the joint Vaccine Introduction Readiness Assessment Tool \n(VIRAT) and Vaccine Readiness Assessment Framework (VRAF) supported by the World Health \nOrganization (WHO) and the World Bank. The vaccination program set out in the plan aims to \nvaccinate 60% of the total adult population (18 and above) or about 1.7 million people by the end \nof 2021 (about 45% of the total population). Vaccination is open to anyone with a Georgian \nidentification card, including internally displaced persons. Foreign nationals and stateless persons \nwith a valid visa or a residence permit, or who are staying in Georgia in line with visa-free \nregulations and entered Georgia at least 3 months before, are also eligible.31 The plan follows the \nrecommendations of the WHO strategic advisory group of experts on immunization on global \nCOVID-19 policies and strategies for vaccine development and vaccination programs. The plan \nprioritizes vaccination of health workers, residents and staff of long-term care centers, elderly \npersons  and  persons  with  chronic  diseases,  and  essential  service  providers.  MOILHSA  is \nconsidering extending vaccination to a larger share of the adult population and add younger age \ngroups toward 2022. Booster doses may be considered.  \n \n14.  Vaccines may be procured through several channels. As a self-financing country of the \nCOVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) Facility, one of the four pillars of the Access to \nCOVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator under WHO, Georgia is eligible to purchase vaccines for 20% \nof the total population (equivalent of 1,484,400 doses).32 Additional COVID-19 vaccines may be \n \n29 ADB estimates. As the NVDP is a living document, costs will need regular updates as well. \n30 Georgia. 2021. Georgia COVID-19 Vaccine National Deployment Plan. 8 April.  \n31 There is no vaccination by the government in occupied territories. People from occupied territories can be vaccinated \nin other regions. Order N 01-285/o, signed by the minister of health on 22 July 2021, defines further eligible population \ngroups. \n32 Launched in April 2020, the ACT Accelerator is a groundbreaking global collaboration (The Coalition for Epidemic \nPreparedness  Innovations;  Gavi,  The  Vaccine  Alliance  (GAVI);  WHO;  and  the  World  Bank)  to  accelerate \n \n \n ", "6    \n \npurchased via the COVAX Facility.33 The government is also procuring vaccines through bilateral \ndeals  with  manufacturers,  including  Sinopharm,  Sinovac,  and  Pfizer,  and  is  in  early-stage \nnegotiations with Novavax, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson. Lastly, the government is scoping \nto get access to excess vaccines from other countries, including from the European Union. As of \n11 August 2021, 2,583,330 doses had been delivered to Georgia, of which 160,270 doses of \nAstraZeneca and Pfizer were from the COVAX Facility; 1,819,960 doses from bilateral deals with \nSinopharm, Sinovac, and Pfizer; a donation of 100,000 doses from the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina; and a donation of 503,100 Pfizer doses from the United States government. More supplies \nare expected in the third quarter of 2021.34 \n \n15.  COVID-19 vaccination started in March 2021, following the NVDP priority groups and \ngradually expanding to further population groups, depending on the availability and uptake of \nvaccines. As  of  11 August,  688,940  persons  had  been vaccinated  (40.5%  of  2021 target \npopulation) of which 210,776 were fully vaccinated (two doses) (12.4% of 2021 target population). \nA  risk  communication  and  community  engagement  strategy  is  being  implemented  by  the \nMOILHSA with support from several development partners.35 The strategy aims to increase \nconfidence in, acceptance of, and demand for a COVID-19 vaccine (footnote 3). Activities are \ntargeted to increase uptake of vaccination among certain groups such as health workers, and the \nRed Cross Society works with the NCDC on video clips in local languages for broadcast on local \ntelevision.  \n \n16.  Vaccine  logistics  (storage  and  vaccination  delivery)  are  vaccine  dependent.  Some \nvaccines are administered only in hospitals because of cold chain requirements and to monitor \npotential adverse events following immunization (AEFIs); other vaccines are administered at the \nprimary-care level. Mass vaccination centers are planned. Mobile teams are expediting the \nvaccination of persons with disabilities and persons in long-term care facilities and penitentiaries. \nThe  Red  Cross Society  is  actively  involved  in  identifying  and  compiling  lists  of vulnerable \npopulation groups unable to reach vaccination facilities, mostly the elderly, together with the \nNCDC. The lists are submitted to MOILHSA for mobile team outreach. Cold chain capacity is \nadequate  and  delivery  of  vaccines  is  efficiently  sequenced.  WHO  and  other  development \npartners are helping improve cold chain capacity with additional vaccine carriers and refrigerators \nfor additional vaccines. Vaccine stock and vaccination progress are monitored through the \nelectronic  inventory  management  module  and  electronic  immunization  module  (IMEM).  All \nvaccination facilities need to be linked to the IMEM, which monitors vaccination registration in \nreal time. The IMEM is linked to the civil registry or national identification and issues short \nmessaging  service  (SMS)  notifications  for  booking  confirmation,  reminders  before  the \nvaccination, and notification for second doses. A hotline for assistance with booking, questions, \nand complaints on the vaccination process has been established by MOILHSA. All health staff \nwere trained and a quality control system and monitoring are in place. AEFIs are monitored \nvigilantly  and  its  forms  updated  to  reflect  COVID-19  vaccination  requirements,  including \nmanaging anaphylactic shocks. The electronic integrated disease surveillance system has been \nfurther updated to monitor COVID-19 vaccine AEFIs.  \n \ndevelopment, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines. It is organized into four \npillars: diagnostics, treatment (therapeutics), vaccines, and health system strengthening. COVAX and WHO. The \nAccess to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator. \n33 COVID-19 vaccines procured through the COVAX Facility are not free, but because of the nature of the pooled \nprocurement, a global fair allocation plan may be cheaper than direct procurement from manufacturers.  \n34 Information on overall vaccine needs can be retrieved from the Vaccine Needs Assessment (accessible from the list \nof linked documents in Appendix 2. \n35 Strategic communication elements include (i) capacity building of health-care specialists; (ii) social listening, media \nengagement, and disinformation management; (iii) risk communication and public engagement; and (iv) crisis \ncommunication, including in case of possible complications after immunization. \n \n ", " 7 \n \n \n4.  Development Partner Coordination \n \n17.  The government is working closely with all development partners to mobilize funding and \nensure that partners are coordinated in delivering priority assistance. MOILHSA is coordinating \nthe health sector response with all partners. ADB is in regular consultation with development \npartners through the United Nations Resident Coordinator and on a bilateral basis. ADB\u2019s support \ncomplements  other  development  partners\u2019  assistance to support vaccine  procurement  and \ndelivery  and  strengthen  program  implementation  capacity.  The  World  Bank  has  approved \nadditional financing for vaccine procurement and a capacity development loan of $34.5 million. \nThe European Investment Bank will provide a flexible amount reprogrammed from an existing \nproject and will cover most of the government\u2019s contribution to the COVAX Facility. WHO and the \nUnited  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund  (UNICEF)  are  providing technical  assistance  and capacity \ndevelopment in behavior change communication, service delivery and vaccine administration, \nand updating of information systems. WHO will procure refrigerators and vaccine carriers to \nstrengthen cold chain capacity. \n \nB.  Project Description   \n \n1.  Impact and Outcome \n \n18.  The project is aligned with the following impacts: (i) stabilize the situation and save lives \n(footnote 3); and (ii) spread, morbidity, and mortality of COVID-19 reduced and confidence of \ncitizens restored (footnote 1). The project outcome is that the target populations per the NVDP \nare vaccinated against COVID-19. \n \n2.  Outputs \n \n19.  Output 1. COVID-19 vaccine procured and delivered to designated points. The \nproject will finance procurement and delivery of vaccines through bilateral deals between the \ngovernment  and  manufacturers  and/or  through  the  COVAX  Facility.  Procurement  through \nbilateral deals with other countries will be considered, subject to due diligence and necessary \napprovals.  To vaccinate  an  estimated  0.3 million  persons,  0.7  million doses  of  COVID-19 \nvaccines (assuming 10% adjustment for wastage) will be delivered to regional warehouses \naccording to the NVDP. The expenditure items under the RRC will include (i) vaccines that meet \nany  of  the  eligibility  requirements  of  the  APVAX  policy,  including  advance  payments;  (ii) \ninternational logistics and related services required to transport vaccines from the place of \npurchase to regional warehouses; and (iii) ancillary items such as syringes, safety boxes, and \nother items required to administer the vaccines. The NCDC will be responsible for transporting \nthe  vaccine  from  the  regional  warehouses  to  the  vaccine  administration  sites.  Before  the \ndisbursement of the loan proceeds, MOILHSA shall submit to ADB purchase agreements for the \nvaccines that comply with APVAX policy requirements.  \n \n20.  Output 2. Vaccine program implementation capacity strengthened. Under the PIC, \nthe project will support activities that will strengthen (i) the project implementation unit (PIU) under \nthe MOILHSA to help implement and monitor the COVID-19 vaccination program; and (ii) carry \nout gender mainstreaming activities, which include approving updated budget and guidelines for \nmobile teams to reach marginalized groups, including women. Additional staff will be hired under \nthe project to augment PIU capacity.  \n \n \n \n ", "8    \n \n3.  Value Addition \n \n21.  The proposed project is part of ADB's holistic support for Georgia\u2019s response to the \nCOVID-19 crisis, and will help mitigate adverse health, social, and economic impacts while \ntargeting vulnerable population segments and ensuring gender mainstreaming. By contributing \nto the recovery of Georgia\u2019s trade in goods and services with regional partners through reduced  \ncross-border health threats, the project will have positive implications for regional cooperation \nand integration.36  ADB has been engaged early to back up the government\u2019s COVID-19 response \nwith budget support through the COVID-19 Active Response and Expenditure Support (CARES) \nProgram, and grants to improve laboratory diagnostic and testing capacity and procure personal \nprotective equipment and other medical supplies. ADB provided upstream technical assistance \nstarting in December 2020 to develop the NVDP.37 As a trusted partner, ADB may continue its \nsupport to Georgia with a proposed health sector project being discussed for the forthcoming \nindicative country pipeline and monitoring report, 2022\u22122024 to boost longer-term health system \nstrengthening and health sector reforms. ADB support for capacity building will help ensure that \nhigh-quality vaccines are procured and delivered; the most vulnerable target groups are served; \nand gender, social, and environmental safeguards are met.  \n   \n4.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n22.  The project is estimated to cost \u20ac14.92 million inclusive of taxes and duties, physical and \nprice contingencies, interest, and other charges during implementation (Table 2). Detailed cost \nestimates by expenditure category are included in the project administration manual.38 Cost \nestimates are based on certain assumptions on the types of vaccines to be procured and their \nmarket prices.  \n  Table 2: Summary Cost Estimates \n(\u20ac million) \nItem  Amounta \nA.

Total physical \ncontingencies represent 7.7% computed at 7% for vaccine procurement and 10% for all other cost categories and \nprice contingencies represent 3.7% which are calculated based on escalation rates for domestic and international \ncosts estimated for Georgia, including provision for potential exchange rate fluctuation under the assumption of a \npurchasing power parity exchange rate. Annual escalation rate for international costs is estimated at 1.6% for 2021 \nand 1.7% for 2022 and for 2023. The annual escalation rate for domestic costs is estimated at 6.5% for 2021, 4.0% \nfor 2022, and 3.0% for 2023. \n \n36 Georgia\u2019s merchandise exports fell by 12.3% and imports by 13.8% in 2020 compared with the previous year. Service \nexports tumbled by 65.5% as international arrivals plunged by more than 80% and revenue from tourism by 90%. \nMore than 40% of Georgia\u2019s external trade in 2019 was with countries in Asia while about 34% of tourists visiting \nGeorgia in 2019 came from Armenia and Azerbaijan. \n37 ADB. 2020.

The government has requested (i) a regular loan of \u20ac12.18 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources under the RRC of the APVAX, and (ii) a regular loan of \u20ac0.46 million from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources under the PIC of the APVAX. The loan under the RRC will have a 10-\nyear term, including a grace period of 3 years, while the loan under the PIC will have a 22-year \nterm, including a grace period of 15 years. Both loans will have an annual interest rate determined \nin  accordance  with ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending facility;  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per annum; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the \ndraft loan agreements. Based on the straight-line method, the average maturity of the loan under \nthe RRC is 6.75 years and no maturity premium is payable to ADB. Based on the custom-tailored \namortization method, the average maturity of the loan under the PIC is 18.99 years and the \nmaturity premium payable to ADB is 0.20% per year. The government has made an independent \ndecision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility and has given an undertaking that \nthe choice was not made based on any advice from ADB.  \n \n24.  The summary financing plan is in Table 3. For output 1 under the RRC, ADB will finance \neligible expenditures to procure and deliver COVID-19 vaccines and ancillary goods to regional \nwarehouses. For output 2 under the PIC, ADB will finance expenditures for project management \nand gender-related activities. The government will contribute the equivalent of \u20ac2.28 million to \ncover taxes and duties through exemption, project management, and contingencies, as agreed \nwith the government.

Debt Sustainability Analysis \n \n25.  The International Monetary Fund debt sustainability analysis suggests that the public \ndebt\u2013GDP ratio, which stood at about 40% in 2019, rose sharply to 61% by 2020 mainly because \nof the widening of the fiscal deficit, exchange rate depreciation, and economic contraction.39 The \nanalysis, however, corroborates that the debt\u2013GDP ratio is projected to decline to 51.3% by 2026, \nas one-off spending measures wane and economic growth resumes. The analysis confirms that \npublic debt will remain sustainable and below the high-risk thresholds in all standardized macro-\nfiscal stress tests, considering shocks to real GDP growth, the primary balance, real interest rate, \nand exchange rate depreciation. The lending from ADB (\u20ac12.64 million or $15 million), which \nrepresents about 0.2% of Georgia\u2019s outstanding public debt stock during 2020, will not deteriorate \ndebt sustainability in the medium term. \n \n39 International Monetary Fund. 2021.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n26.  Implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the \nproject administration manual. The MOILHSA will be the executing agency and will be supported \nby the NCDC and the Ministry of Finance. The MOILHSA PIU, established in 2020 under the \nWorld Bank-financed COVID-19 response project, will support project implementation. Additional \nPIU staff will be hired to support financial management; environmental safeguards, including \nmedical waste management; gender-related activities; and monitoring and evaluation. Additional \ninternational expertise may be organized through existing technical assistance.40 The deputy \nminister in charge of health will oversee project implementation.  \n \n27.  The MOILHSA has overall responsibility for procurement of vaccines under bilateral deals \nbetween the government and manufacturers and/or through the COVAX Facility. The MOILHSA \nwill procure ancillary items financed by the project. The PIU will support the procurement of \nvaccines and ancillary items and has sufficient capacity to do so. Value for money in procurement \nwill be achieved by (i) securing vaccines through bilateral deals with manufacturers or other \ngovernments, or through the COVAX Facility on reasonable commercial terms, thus providing \noptions to the government and balancing supply availability and brand choice for the national \nvaccination program; (ii) negotiating deals that are reasonable, noting the significantly constrained \nmarket conditions; and (iii) having sellers deliver to Georgia or contract for logistics separately, \neither way transferring international cold chain risk to specialist service providers. \n \n28.  Governance structure. The Interagency Coordination Council, under the Prime Minister, \nis the main high-level decision maker for the COVID-19 vaccination campaign. The Coordinating \nCommission,  chaired  by  the  MOILHSA  minister,  leads  the  coordination  of  the  COVID-19 \nvaccination campaign and oversees NVDP implementation. The National Immunization Technical \n \nAdvisory Group provides technical recommendations on priority groups and age restrictions.\nEight technical working groups helped prepare and update the NVDP. The MOILHSA is the lead \nagency for the overall vaccination program. The NCDC is responsible for operationalizing the \nNVDP and carries out training activities, supervision, communication activities, monitoring of \nvaccine stocks and administration, and investigation and reporting of any adverse reactions. The \nconcerned regulatory authorities approve vaccines. Planning, coordination, management, and \nmonitoring mechanisms have been established at the regional, municipal, and service delivery \nlevels. \n \nTable 4: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation perioda  October 2021\u2013April 2023 \nEstimated completion date  30 April 2023 \nEstimated loan closing  31 October 2023 \ndate \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Coordinating Commission chaired by the MOILHSA minister \n(ii)  Executing agency  MOILHSA \n(iii) Implementation unit  Existing PIU under MOILHSA to be shared with World Bank and other development \npartners \nCurrent staff to be augmented by five additional PIU support staff for ADB project \n \n40 ADB. 2020.

Withdrawals from the loan account may be made \nfor advance financing in an amount of up to 6 months of estimated eligible \nexpenditures or 50% of the RRC loan amount, whichever is lower. The combined \noutstanding balance of advance financing and retroactive financing should not, at \nany time, exceed 60% of the RRC loan amount, while the advance financing and \nretroactive financing remain within their respective ceilings. Any advance financing \nand retroactive financing will be subject to vaccine eligibility criteria and other \nrequirements under the APVAX policy being fully met. The issuance of invitations \nto bid and of consulting service recruitment notices under advance contracting and \nretroactive  financing  will be  subject  to ADB  approval.  The  government  and \nexecuting  agency  were  advised  that  approval  of  advance  contracting  and \nretroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance the project. \nDisbursementb   The loan proceeds will be disbursed following ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements agreed between \nthe government and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank; APFS = Audited Project Financial Statements; APVAX = Asia Pacific Vaccine \nAccess Facility; COVID-19 = coronavirus disease; MOILHSA = Ministry of Internally Displaced Persons from the \nOccupied Territories, Labor, Health and Social Affairs; PIU = project implementation unit; RRC = rapid response \ncomponent. \na The implementation period starts from the expected month of commitment or signing. \nb For guidance, refer to ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. \nNote: Estimated costs of contracts are inclusive of taxes. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial Analysis  \n \n29.  The achievement of herd immunity from COVID-19 through the vaccination program will \nresult in substantially reducing mortality and morbidity and contribute to putting the economy back \non a normal development track by encouraging the resumption of economic activities, including \nproduction, investment, and trade. Financial analysis concluded that the vaccination program\u2019s \nfinancial sustainability has moderate risk. Health sector spending increased significantly in 2020, \nin absolute and relative terms, reflecting Georgia\u2019s determined effort to end the COVID-19 \n \n ", "12    \n \npandemic. The financial analysis shows that annual health sector spending was stable during \n2016\u20132019 in relative terms, indicating a good basis to ensure regular operations and asset \nmaintenance. Budget execution by the MOILHSA is high in all years. Funding for COVID-19 \npandemic  management from the  health sector  budget is set  at GEL350  million  for  2021. \nGovernment  funding,  together  with  external  support,  will  help  adequately  finance  the \nimplementation of the government\u2019s COVID-19 vaccination program. Medium-term health sector \nallocations (2022\u20132024) are below the 2021 spending level, but nothing indicates that the \ngovernment should not be able to maintain existing service levels and ensure sustainable \noperations. The government is preparing a dedicated budget to implement the NVDP, to be \nadopted in the third quarter of 2021, which will outline the level and timing of funding required \nand its sources. Project financial viability was not assessed since the project is not meant to \nrecover costs. \n \nB.  Governance and Anticorruption \n \n30.  Georgia has adequate legislation and institutions in place that ensure accountability, \nincluding the General Code of Ethics and Conduct for Civil Service Decree portal and the Law on \nConflict of Interest and Corruption in Public Institutions, which also applies to all MOILHSA staff \nand employees. The Civil Service Bureau has a whistleblower portal, where issues and concerns \ncan be reported anonymously. Georgia\u2019s ombudsman institution is the Public Defender, which \ndetermines whether state laws, policies, and practices comply with international standards. \nInvestigation and prosecution of corruption cases are the remit of the Prosecutor\u2019s Office Division \nof Criminal Prosecution of Corruption Crimes.41 \n \n31.  As per the most recent Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Assessment \n(2018),42 Georgia performed particularly well in budget reliability, transparency of public finances, \npolicy-based fiscal strategy and budgeting, and predictability and control in budget execution. \nThe fiduciary risk associated with the government\u2019s public financial management system is \ndeemed  to  be  moderate  overall  and  has  improved  with  the  implementation  of  reforms. \nGovernance risks related to procurement and delivery of vaccines will be mitigated through \ndetailed planning, coordination, capacity building, inspection, and audit. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption \nPolicy (1998, as amended to date) has been explained to and discussed with the government \nand the MOILHSA.  \n \nC.  Environment and Social Safeguards  \n \n32.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.43  \n \n33.  Environment (category C). The project will not entail civil works or other activities with \npotential for significant adverse impacts on the environment. The distribution and use of COVID-\n19 vaccines will result in a temporary increase in immunization waste generation. The NVDP \ndefines waste management arrangements and responsibilities. Health-care facilities are required \nto develop waste management plans prepared according to the national regulation. \n \n34.  Involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples (category C). The project will not \nentail civil works or other activities with potential for land acquisition and resettlement impacts. \n \n41 Prosecutor's Office of Georgia. \n42 Government of Georgia. 2018.

Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \n ", " 13 \n \nWhile  Georgia  has  many  ethnic  groups,  all  citizens  have  equal  human  rights  under  the \nconstitution.  No  indigenous  people  will  be  affected  by the  project  as  defined  by  the  ADB \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  Thus,  the  project  is  categorized  as  C  for  involuntary \nresettlement. \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender  \n \n35.  Poverty  and  social  considerations.  Vaccination  will  help  to  further  reduce  the \npandemic\u2019s impact on poverty by reducing the burden of disease, allowing health services to \nrecover and, more broadly, allowing for speedy recovery of employment and business.44 Health \nworkers, persons with chronic infections, and the elderly are particularly vulnerable to the impact \nof COVID-19 (footnote 6). There are about 64,000 health workers in Georgia, about 90,000 \npeople aged 18\u201354 years with chronic disease, and a rapidly aging population, with 28% above \n55 years old (footnote 3). Prioritizing vaccination of these target groups will significantly reduce \nthe risk of infection, severity, and fatal outcomes of COVID-19. \n \n36.  Gender. The project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming.45 The COVID-19 \npandemic has likely amplified gender differences in access to services and increased household \npressures. A study on public attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination reports that more women \nthan men in Georgia believe that vaccination is not effective.46 The project gender action plan \nhelps tackle gender issues related to the vaccination program. The plan contains key gender \nactions: (i) conduct gender sensitivity training sessions on capacity-building activities for health \nworkers,  vaccinators,  and  staff  in  vaccination  centers;  (ii)  integrate  gender  sensitivity  into \nguidelines  for  mobile  teams  to  reach  marginalized  groups,  especially  women;  (iii)  update \ncommunication plans to increase gender sensitivity, deal with vaccine hesitancy, and help health \nworkers ensure that people know the benefits of vaccination and safe post-vaccination care \nprocedures; (iv) develop a sex-disaggregated database of the targeted population for vaccination; \nand (v) conduct a satisfaction survey on the vaccinated population to assess the gender-sensitive \napproaches to vaccination and inform the sex-disaggregated database.  \n \nE.  Financial Due Diligence  \n \n37.  Financial  management.  The  financial  management  assessment  finds  the  project \nfinancial management risk to be substantial, owing in part to the risks associated with some \nweaknesses in the MOILHSA\u2019s financial management procedures and first engagement with ADB \nprojects. A time-bound financial management action plan has been agreed between ADB and the \ngovernment to manage these weaknesses. Risk mitigation measures are agreed as summarized \nin Table 5.
