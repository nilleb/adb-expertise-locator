INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Operational Plan for Sustainable Food Security in Asia and the Pacific of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) supports ADB\u2019s Strategy 20201 for inclusive growth through agricultural \nand  natural  resources  research  (ANRR).  The  priority  ANRR  agenda  for  Asia  is  ensuring \nsustainable and inclusive food security.2 However, achieving this goal presents a major challenge. \nFirst,  while  the  region  is  both  the  largest  producer  and  consumer  of the  world\u2019s  major food \ncommodities,3 Asia has only 38% of the global agriculture land and 30% of the world\u2019s renewable \nwater.  Climate  change,  declining  food  crop  productivity  trends,  increasing  population,  and \nincreasing incomes make it difficult for Asia to substantially and sustainably improve its food \nproduction, in order to feed the growing regional and global population. Second, Asia will have to \naim for both food and nutrition security. A recent report4 on food security in Asia noted the region\u2019s \nfood insecurity situation is \u201cfull of contradictions.\u201d Asia has some of the fastest growing economies, \nbut is also home to about 65% (or 578 million) of the world\u2019s undernourished people. The health \nand nutrition of the extremely poor and vulnerable groups, especially women and children, are \nadversely affected by volatile food prices, as shown after the 2007\u20132008 global food price hikes. \nThe  proposed  regional  research  and  development  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  focus  on \nimproving sustainable food and nutrition security.5 It builds on previous ANRR TA projects on \nimproving productivity and developing integrated food supply chains and participatory priority-\nsetting of agriculture research for development (ARD).6 It will likewise provide concrete measures \nfor implementing the recently forged Asia and the Pacific Regional Food Security Partnership \nFramework as ADB\u2019s commitment to its developing member countries (DMCs) in Asia, whose \nrepresentatives  in  the  forum  strongly  encouraged  development  organizations  to  expand  and \nsynergize their food security efforts. 7 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Reducing food and nutrition insecurity in Asia requires addressing the following binding \nconstraints: stagnating food productivity and production, unconnected or fragmented food supply \nchains, and underinvestment in ARD. Pragmatic short-term solutions are needed that target small-\nscale farmers, who comprise the bulk of food producers in Asia; simultaneously, the foundations \nmust be established for long-term structural measures that promote the availability, accessibility, \nand utility of nutritious and safe food, especially for vulnerable groups in Asia.  \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank. 2008\u20132020. Manila. \n2  Food security exists when all people, at all times, have physical, social, and economic access to sufficient safe and \nnutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life (Food and Agriculture \nOrganization of the United Nations [FAO]. 1996. World Food Summit Plan of Action. Rome: FAO). \n3  The region accounts for 90% of the world\u2019s market for rice, 40% for cereals, 40% for meat, 80% for aquaculture \nproducts, and 70% of the overall global food and vegetable market. Asia feeds nearly 60% of the world\u2019s population \nand supports the rural livelihood of more than 2 billion people, including four fifths of the world\u2019s small and marginal \nfarmers and 90% of the world\u2019s fisher folk (ADB. 2009.

The forum was \njointly organized by ADB, FAO, and the International Fund for Agricultural Development. One of its major outcomes is \nthe signing of the Asia and the Pacific Regional Food Security Partnership Framework. \n ", "2   \n3.  Addressing rice yield gaps.8 Rice production suffers from a yield gap of 1\u20132 tons per \nhectare (ha) in many DMCs in Asia. Declining investments in rice research and development, \ncoupled with diminishing production due to degraded land and water resources as well as climate \nchange impacts, have contributed to this gap. New high-yielding rice varieties that adapt to the \nvagaries of the environment and climate are urgently needed, but these will take at least 10\u201315 \nyears to develop. The yield gap can be reduced in the interim by addressing pre- and postharvest \nlosses,  which  on  average  translate to  10%\u201325%  of the  yield  gap.  Climate  change  and  poor \nagronomic  practices  (i.e.,  excessive  insecticide  use)  have  caused  pest  diseases  such  as \nplanthopper outbreaks to spread in rice-producing Asian countries. The use of ecologically based \nagronomic management practices can prevent major pest outbreaks, reduce the risk of pre-harvest \nlosses, and make farms more resilient to climate variability. Proper postharvest measures can also \nreduce food-borne contaminations, such as mycotoxins, and reduce wastage due to poor drying.   \n \n4.  Producing food with less water.9 Food and nutrition security is threatened by an ensuing \nwater crisis.10 Asia\u2019s green revolution of intensive agriculture relied heavily on irrigation. Asia \naccounts for 70% of the world\u2019s irrigated land, and more than half of its water is used for agriculture. \nA large portion of irrigation water is sourced from surface and groundwater, which has become \nincreasingly  polluted  and  scarce.  Climate  change  is  increasing  rainfall  pattern  variability. \nCompetition for water is intensifying between food and nonfood crops, between agriculture and \nnon-agriculture sectors, and between rural and urban users. Innovative ways are urgently needed \nto incentivize small-scale farmers to (i) reduce water use while increasing the efficiency and \nsustainability of water use, (ii) efficiently divert saved water from agriculture to non-agriculture and \nurban purposes, and (iii) encourage investment in technologies and practices that increase food \nand feed crop production and farmers\u2019 income while reducing water use.  \n \n5.  Low private sector engagement in food supply chains. Food supply chains in DMCs are \ngenerally fragmented and uncoordinated, resulting in a limited supply of and difficulty in accessing \naffordable, nutritious, and safe food. The private sector can facilitate the development of efficient, \nadaptable, and inclusive food supply chains. However, their participation is hindered by (i) poor \nlogistics, storage, and information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure; (ii) limited \nfinance for small-scale farmers and small- and medium-scale traders and processors; and (iii) lack \nof transparent, predictable, and accountable regulatory frameworks for investments and contracts. \nThe private sector has the resources and expertise to spur agriculture development and rural \nindustrialization through essential food supply chain linkages. Pooled funds that may serve as an \nimpetus for agriculture land and food chain development in DMCs are also emerging. Private \nsector  engagement  in  integrating  food  supply  chains  in  the  region  is  growing,  but  not  well \ndocumented, especially those investments that have a significant impact on short- and long-term \nstructural  concerns.  There  is  also  a  need  to  identify  the  potential  for  expanding  innovative \npartnership arrangements that employ the private sector\u2019s profit-maximizing behavior in increasing \nnational and regional food and nutrition security.   \n \n                                                \n8  Most of the discussions about the rice production problem in Asia and the potential to bridge the yield gap through pre- \nand postharvest were taken from the (i) IRRI, Africa Rice and the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) \nproposal to the Consultative Group of International Agricultural Centers (CGIAR). 2010.

More focused agricultural research for development.11 In Asia, the key concerns for \nsustaining  ARD  are  dwindling  funds  from  traditional  sources  and  declining  human  resource \ncapacity; the need for a multistakeholder-driven and strategic ARD plan of action; and weak \ndelivery and extension mechanisms for ARD. More than 80% of DMC ARD funds come from the \npublic sector; the rest are from official development assistance, private sector, and producer and \norganization boards. Except for the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and India, most Asian DMCs \nexhibit declining public spending and overseas development assistance for ARD, which is shifting \nto Sub-Saharan Africa. In 2009, an ARD agenda for Asia was presented at the seminal Global \nConference for  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development  held  in  Montpellier  last  March  2010. The \nagenda will need to be refined to (i) include views from the demand side (farmers groups, civil \nsociety, and private sector); and (ii) develop a pragmatic plan of action with measures that reduce \nshort-term food price volatility, address long-term structural concerns, expand investment sources \nfor ARD, encourage innovative ARD delivery, and develop results-based monitoring and feedback \nsystems.   \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n7.  The proposed TA will evaluate various novel approaches12 that attempt to tackle these \nconcerns,  including  by  examining  their  impact  pathways,  and  recommending  strategic  policy \nactions and \u201cbest bets\u201d\u2014innovative measures that can be expanded and replicated. Innovative \nmeasures will include those that (i) have a high impact on ensuring food and nutrition security; (ii) \nengage small-scale farmers; (iii) are feasible, transparent, and entail low transaction costs; (iv) can \nbe  replicated  or  expanded;  (v)  are  environmentally  friendly;  (vi)  empower  women,  and  (vii) \nencourage  collaboration  between  developing  countries  or  regions.  It  is  envisaged  that  the \ninvestment options will provide those involved with the food supply chain in Asia and ADB regional \ndepartments with food and nutrition security-related investment opportunities. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The desired impact is improved sustainable food and nutrition security in East, South, and \nSoutheast Asia (Appendix 1). The expected outcome is increased food and nutrition security \ninvestments by the public and private sectors and civil society in participating DMCs\u2014Bangladesh, \nCambodia, the PRC, India, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), Philippines, Thailand, \nand Viet Nam\u2014at all stages of the agriculture and food supply chains. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n9.  To achieve the outcome, the TA outputs are (i) adoption of ecologically based management \nmethods that reduce rice pest outbreaks, and economically viable postharvest rice technologies \nand management by rice farmers and others in the rice sector of Cambodia, the PRC, Philippines, \nThailand,  and  Viet  Nam;13(ii)  development  and  dissemination  of  innovations  and  partnership \n                                                \n11  Background materials for the Asian agriculture research for development discussion include final reports of ADB\u2019s \nRegional Consultative Process on Prioritization of Agriculture Research and Development Agenda for Asia and the \nPacific; Support for the Association of Southeast Asian nations Plus Three Integrated Food Security Framework.; \nBientema, N. and H.

These are run successfully by \nthe private sector, producers\u2019 organizations, nongovernment organizations, or through public\u2013private partnerships. \n13  ADB supported these countries to pilot test pre- and postharvest technologies and practices in previous TAs. These \nare part of the 5-year program for pre- and post harvest of IRRI. It is envisaged that the additional support will provide \nthe resources for accelerating expanded adoption the technologies and good practices.   \n ", "4   \ninvestments for water-saving technologies and financing of nutritious and safe food supply chains \nin Bangladesh, the PRC, India, and Lao PDR;14 and (iii) development of a demand-driven and \nresults-based strategic action plan for ARD of Asian DMCs.  \n \n10.   Output 1 will use a combined field and participatory research-based approach involving the \nnational agriculture research and extension systems (NARES) and other local stakeholders in the \npilot project sites for the trial testing, validation, and dissemination of technologies and good \npractices.  Expansion  of  the  scale  of  these  innovations  will  be  done  mainly  through  NARES, \nsupported by the multisector regional rice networks. Key activities include developing a monitoring \nsystem of pre-harvest pest diseases and policy advocacy and extension services, developing and \ndisseminating business models for viable postharvest technologies, and developing a mycotoxin \nreduction strategy for inclusion in national agriculture sector strategies.   \n \n11.   For output 2, impact pathway assessments will be undertaken of (i) business-supportive \npolicies;  (ii)  investments  for  and  innovative  management  of  water  use  and  water-saving \ntechniques; and (iii) financing inclusive food supply chains, with special attention to nutrition and \nhealth. Using evidence-based ranking of investment options, a menu of the most desirable (\u201cbest \nbet\u201d) investment areas for sustainable water use technologies and food supply chain partnerships \nfor innovative financing will be identified, promoted, and trialed in participating DMCs. A conference \nwith a major theme of leveraging food supply chains for improved nutrition and health will also be \nconducted.  \n \n12.   For output 3, focus group discussions will be held with farmers\u2019 organizations, civil society, \nand private sector engaged in food supply chains. Awareness of the Asian ARD will be increased \nthrough road shows and policy dialogues, and mechanisms for information sharing and cross-\nlearning through south\u2013south collaboration will be included in the ARD action plan. Knowledge \nproducts on novel partnerships for integrated food supply chains will be developed.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $4,160,000  equivalent,  of  which  $4  million \nequivalent will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-\nother sources). The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) and IRRI will finance an \nequivalent of $60,000 and $100,000, respectively. IFPRI and IRRI will provide in-kind contribution \nof staff time, office space, research operations, and administrative and support costs (Appendix 2).  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  The TA will be implemented for about 24 months from November 2010 to December 2012. \nADB,  through  its  Regional  and  Sustainable  Development  Department  (Agriculture,  Rural \nDevelopment, and Food Security Unit), will be the executing agency. The unit will work closely with \nthe communities of practice on agriculture, rural development, and food security; health; water; and \ngender and development, as well as with ADB regional departments to ensure feedback on the \nlessons generated and the novel investment and partnership opportunities.  \n \n15.  IRRI will be the implementing agency for the delivery of output 1, and IFPRI for outputs 2 \nand 3. Before starting proposed activities within a DMC, receipt of no-objection letters from the \ngovernments of Bangladesh, Cambodia, the PRC, India, Lao PDR, Philippines, Thailand, and Viet \nNam will be required.  \n                                                \n14  Stakeholders from these subregions participated at the Investment Forum for Food Security in Asia and the Pacific \n(footnote 7). Country case studies in these subregions will focus on Bangladesh, the People\u2019s Republic of China, India, \nand  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic.  The  governments  of  these  countries  are  exploring  food  security \npartnership options.     \n ", "  5 \n \n16.  IRRI is the implementing agency for output 1 because of its achievements and expertise in \nand support infrastructure for cutting-edge rice research and technology. The TA will enable IRRI \nto expand the scale and application of the agronomic management practices and locally generated \npostharvest technology innovations that are generated from Thirteenth Agriculture and Natural \nResources Research at International Agricultural Research Centers and Addressing the Pre- and \nPostharvest Challenges of the Rice Supply Chain.

IFPRI is the implementing \nagency for outputs 2 and 3 because of its long experience on food security, particularly water \nresource  management,  food  supply  chain  development,  food  and  nutrition  nexus,  ARD,  and \ndevelopment of optimal (\u201cbest bet\u201d) approaches.   \n \n17.  ADB will execute a memorandum of agreement with each implementing agency, describing \nthe terms of reference and the responsibilities of the implementing agency with respect to (i) timely \ndelivery of quality outputs, (ii) regular monitoring and evaluation of the subproject\u2019s strategic results \nframework, and (iii) reporting and other communications. The implementing agencies will hold an \ninception workshop within 2 months of the TA\u2019s approval to provide a detailed work plan and \nmilestones for each output. They will submit the following reports to ADB: (i) inception report, (ii) \nmidterm  report,  (iii)  final  report,  (iv)  semiannual  financial  statements,  and  (v)  audited  annual \nfinancial statements. Procurement of goods and related services will be in accordance with ADB's \nProcurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). Disbursements will be undertaken \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). Specifically, the amounts drawn down shall be liquidated against the statement of \nexpenditures. \n \n18.  For output 1, IRRI will recruit about 68 person-months of international and 84 person-\nmonths  of  national  consultant  services  in  the  fields  of  postharvest  systems,  virology,  insect \ntoxicology, taxonomy, training, postharvest, value chain and business modeling, impact pathways, \npolicy, communications, and production and agro-industrial supply chains. For outputs 2 and 3, \nIFPRI  will  recruit  about  24  person-months  of  international  and  34  person-months  of  national \nconsultant  services  for  water  resource  management,  innovative  financing,  ARD,  participatory \nprocesses, and other technical expertise that may be needed for the ARD strategic action plan. \nWhere appropriate, IFPRI will recruit technical experts from specialized international research \ncenters and development organizations that are partners of the Asia and the Pacific Regional Food \nSecurity Partnership Framework. It will also coordinate with regional research networks like the \nAsia-Pacific Association of Agricultural Research Institutions The outline terms of reference for \nconsultants is in Appendix 3. All consultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time).  \n \n19.  ADB will implement the outreach activities in the dissemination, and where needed, startup \nactivities for implementation of the ARD, best practices, and other knowledge products resulting \nfrom the TA. It will also implement other follow-through activities for the Asia and the Pacific \nRegional Food Security Partnership Framework. One international expert (2 person-months) and 4 \nnational  experts  (26  person-months)  will  support  these  activities.
