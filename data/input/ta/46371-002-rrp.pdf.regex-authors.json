THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \npolicy-based loan, and (ii) a proposed policy-based grant, both to the Kingdom of Bhutan for the \nStrengthening  Economic  Management  Program  II  (SEMP  II).  The  report  also  describes  the \nproposed technical assistance (TA) for Supporting Implementation of SEMP II, and if the Board \napproves the proposed policy-based loan and grant, I, acting under the authority delegated to me \nby the Board, approve the TA.1 \n \n2.  The  program  will  provide  budget  support  for  reforms  to  (i)  improve  revenue  and \nmacroprudential  management,  and  (ii)  strengthen  financial  sector  development  by  targeting \ncapital  markets, financial  inclusion,  and  the  Credit Information  Bureau  (CIB). Through  these \nreforms, the program will improve macroeconomic stability in Bhutan.  \nII.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Past structural and cyclical imbalances and ADB\u2019s assistance. With the hydropower \nsector driving growth, Bhutan\u2019s economy achieved an average annual gross domestic product \n(GDP)  growth  rate  of  8%  during  fiscal  years  (FYs)  2001\u20132011.  Despite  the  high  growth \nperformance,  Bhutan faced a major rupee liquidity crunch in FY2012, which exposed critical \nstructural and cyclical imbalances in the economy related to (i) a narrow economic base, (ii) \nmismatches in revenue flows and debt repayments due to the overreliance on the hydropower \ndevelopment,  (iii)  credit-driven  and  import-dependent  consumption  growth  leading  to  rapid \ndepletion of Indian rupee reserves, and (iv) policy distortions associated with weaknesses in \nmacroeconomic management and financial intermediation.  \n \n4.  In  response  to  the  liquidity  crunch,  the  Government  of  Bhutan  adopted  temporary \nemergency measures such as curtailing credit and import growth. As part of the comprehensive \nreforms, ADB provided support for the government by financing the Strengthening Economic \nManagement Program (SEMP I) in 2013.2 SEMP I successfully helped stabilize the economy, and \nthereby avoid a prolonged slowdown. The economy grew by 3.5% in FY2013 with an increase in \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2013. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Policy-Based Loan \nand Grant to the Kingdom of Bhutan for the Strengthening Economic Management Program. Manila (L2994/G0338-\nBHU).  SEMP  I  was  successfully  completed  in  July  2014.  Major  program  reforms  include  \nstrengthening of budget and debt management through preparation of municipal budgets based on the medium-term \nexpenditure framework, and approval of the Medium-Term Debt Management Strategy, and a strategy for the \ngovernment securities market. For revenue management, the Department of Revenue and Customs piloted the \nrevenue administration management information system (RAMIS). The Ministry of Finance adopted and piloted a new \nproperty valuation methodology. For monetary and liquidity management, the Royal Monetary Authority approved \nmacroprudential regulations, credit rating agency regulations, and the Capital Markets Master Plan. For external and \ninternal audit systems, the Royal Audit Authority piloted an audit resource management system, approved an internal \naudit manual, and completed training of audit staff from the internal audit divisions of the Ministry of Finance and \nother ministries. The program was supported in part by five TA projects. Assessment of the Strengthening Economic \nManagement Program (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "2 \n \ninternational reserves\u2014the balance of payments turned to a surplus of 9.5% of GDP in FY2013, \nfrom a deficit of 10.7% in FY2012.3 \n \n5.  Remaining  development  constraints.  Despite  the  success  of  SEMP  I,  two  critical \ndevelopment  constraints  need  to  be  addressed.4 First,  weak  institutions  and  systems  for \nmacroeconomic  management  constrain  the  government\u2019s  capacity  to  effectively  manage \nmacroeconomic shocks and mitigate their impact on the economy. The government\u2019s capacity \nneeds to be strengthened in this area. Second, the absence of a developed financial sector has \nconstrained private sector development and growth of infrastructure investment. Low investment \nhas led to an undiversified economy that over-relies on the hydropower sector, characterized by \nlow employment generation. Removing policy distortions related to financial intermediation and \naccess to finance is a prerequisite for sustainable economic growth.  \n \n6.  Government  efforts,  ADB\u2019s  policy  dialogue,  and  development  coordination. \nRecognizing these critical constraints, the government is fully committed to putting in place more \npermanent, structural, and corrective measures to strengthen the economy.5 These measures \nwould not only provide continuity and deepen earlier reforms under SEMP I, but also revive the \neconomy and lead to a more sustainable and balanced growth model in Bhutan. SEMP II is timely \nand essential to support the objectives of the government. The reforms proposed under the \nprogram  address  issues  related  to  macroeconomic  management  and  financial  sector \ndevelopment. \n \n7.  The reforms for improving macroeconomic management will help sustain the recovery and \nstrengthen resilience against potential macroeconomic, financial, and external shocks. This will \nhelp minimize volatility and improve macroeconomic stability to achieve sustainable growth. The \nmacroeconomic management reforms have two components. \n \n8.  Revenue management. Given Bhutan\u2019s tax revenue to GDP ratio of 13.2% in FY2014,6 \nthere is scope for additional revenue mobilization by improving tax administration and broadening \nthe tax base. This will reduce the dependence on external grants and loans over the medium to \nlong term and a larger share of development outlays could be financed from country\u2019s own \nresources by creating additional fiscal space.    \n \n9.  Macroprudential  management.  The  reforms  for  macroprudential  management  are \nnecessary  to  enhance  macrofinancial  stability  by  improving  the  regulatory  framework  and \nproviding better supervision of financial system soundness. It is also critical to reduce risks arising \nfrom debt spikes due to challenges in forecasting government revenue and expenditure flows; \nasset\u2013liability mismatches on the banking sector balance sheet; and the hydropower linked pro-\ncyclicality of bank lending. \n \n                                                \n3  The overall macroeconomic conditions have stabilized further with GDP growth at 4.0% in FY2014, although it is still \nbelow the historic average annual growth rate of 8% during FY2001\u2013FY2011. The fiscal deficit increased to 4% in \nFY2014 compared with the deficit during the rupee liquidity crunch due to low tax revenue associated with economic \nslowdown. The current account deficit narrowed slightly. The balance of payments was in a surplus of 5.8% of GDP \nin FY2014, supported by an increase in official reserves in months of import coverage. Money supply growth and \ninflation remained stable due to credit restrictions. No major inflationary risks are associated with capital inflows due \nto the tight monetary policy in FY2014.

These development \nconstraints are also identified in ADB. 2013. Country Diagnostic Studies. Bhutan: Critical Development Constraints. \nManila.  \n5  The Development Policy Letter is in Appendix 3. \n6  Indicative Estimate of Impact from Revenue Reforms (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "3 \n10.  The reforms to strengthen financial sector development under the SEMP II are critical to \naddress  the  lack  of  diversification  and  depth  in  financial  sector,  high  cost  of  financial \nintermediation, lack of long-term financing especially for infrastructure, low savings mobilization, \nand information asymmetries associated with access to finance. The proposed reforms in this \narea will complement government\u2019s own initiatives such as the Capital Markets Master Plan.7 \nMoreover, in line with government priorities under the Eleventh Five-Year Plan (2013\u20132018),8 \nimproving the business climate for the private sector through better CIB coverage and services is \nrequired for Bhutan to lower the country\u2019s dependence on the capital-intensive hydropower sector, \nand diversify its economic base in order to (i) improve its export potential, which could help \nalleviate the current account deficits; (ii) generate employment; and (iii) achieve poverty reduction \ngoals.9  \n \n11.  The policy matrix of SEMP II was designed in coordination with the World Bank\u2019s 2014 \ndevelopment policy credit of $20 million for Fiscal Sustainability and Investment Climate. The \nWorld Bank program focuses on improving the ease of doing business, such as strengthening of \nelectronic  property  and  business  registration  systems,  central  asset  registry,  and  investor \nprotection.  The  two  programs  are  complementary  and  pursue  the  common  objective  of \ncomprehensive private sector development in Bhutan.10 \n \n12.  Reform  program  and  budget  support. The reforms highlighted in the policy matrix \n(Appendix  4)  will  facilitate  Bhutan\u2019s  transition  to  a  sustainable  and  balanced  socioeconomic \ndevelopment  path.  The  budget  support  under  SEMP  II  is  necessary  to  finance  part  of  the \nprojected resource gap (Table 1), particularly covering the period between introduction of reforms, \nand the time when the reforms gain traction and the full impact of the reforms is realized. The \nsupport will temporarily contribute to government spending in areas such as infrastructure and \nsocial programs for education and health, until the full impact of the reforms can lead to more \nsustained development spending. \n13.  ADB\u2019s  value  addition. Through SEMP II, ADB\u2019s value addition in Bhutan will be to \nintroduce reforms in the areas of public resource management and financial and private sector \ndevelopment based on its experience and knowledge of international best practices and extensive \ninvolvement in similar programs in South Asia. ADB\u2019s strength lies in its integrated policy support, \nwhich focuses on \u201chow to do it\u201d and covers (i) policy dialogue, (ii) structuring and design of \ncustomized policy reforms, (iii) policy implementation support, and (iv) capacity development \nthrough technical assistance to ensure sustainability. Very few development partners have the \ncredibility, the means, or the capacity to offer this solutions-based approach, which can effectively \nadapt best practices to the specific needs and conditions of the Bhutanese economy.11 For \nexample, SEMP II, in addition to the attached TA (paras. 25\u201326), is supported by three ongoing \n                                                \n7  The Capital Markets Master Plan for 2014\u20132024 was approved by the Ministry of Finance and the Royal Monetary \nAuthority as a policy action under SEMP I.  \n8  Government  of  Bhutan,  Gross  National  Happiness  Commission. 2013.

In addition, ADB will support the establishment of the Better \nBusiness Council in Bhutan under ADB. 2012.

(TA 8229-BHU). \n10  Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n11 Since 2006, ADB approved two major programs (Financial Sector Development Program and Micro, Small, and \nMedium-Sized Enterprise Sector Development Program [footnote 17]) and 16 TA projects in the areas of public \nsector management and financial and private sector development, which have built the reform momentum leading to \nSEMP I and SEMP II. Through these programs, ADB has gained an in-depth understanding of the capacity of \nBhutanese institutions to effectively manage reforms. Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n ", "4 \n \nTA projects, which will assist the government in (i) operationalizing the tax administration system \nunder the revenue administration management information system (RAMIS);12 (ii) implementing \nmacroprudential  rules  and  regulations,  and  the  liquidity  management  and  stress  testing \nframework;  and  publishing  a  financial  stability  report  for  FY2015;13 and  (iii)  formulating  the \nNational  Pension  Policy  and  a  strategic  plan  for  the  National  Pension  and  Provident  Fund \n(NPPF).14  \n \n14.  Alignment with ADB\u2019s strategy and lessons learned. The program is fully aligned with \nADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2014\u20132018 to improve public sector management, strengthen \nthe financial sector, and promote the private sector development in Bhutan.15  \n \n15.  SEMP II draws lessons from ADB\u2019s experience with policy-based loans in South Asia16 \nand in small economies such as Bhutan and the Maldives,17  and SEMP I (footnote 2). Three \nimportant lessons are that (i) active stakeholder consultation can increase the acceptability and \nmomentum  of  reforms;  (ii)  government  ownership  and  commitment  are  a  prerequisite  for \nsuccessful program implementation; and (iii) sustained engagement with government officials, \nincluding  capacity  development,  is  critical  for  timely  program  completion.  For  the  proposed \nprogram, aside from the government, consultations with financial sector representatives from the \nBankers\u2019 Association of Bhutan and civil society organizations, such as the Bhutan Association of \nWomen Entrepreneurs and National Commission for Women and Children, were conducted and \nstakeholder engagement will continue throughout program implementation.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n16.  The impact of the program will be the achievement of a sustainable growth trajectory for \nBhutan. The outcome will be improved macroeconomic stability. \nC.  Outputs \n17.  The program will support a policy framework with the corresponding outputs and policy \nactions, as detailed in the policy matrix (Appendix 4). There are 8 policy actions under the first \ntranche  and  16  policy  actions  under  the  second  tranche  of  the  program.  The  institutional \ndevelopment plan under the TA is detailed in paras. 25\u201326. \n \n18.  Output 1: Improved macroeconomic management. The program will target following \nareas of macroeconomic management to sustain the momentum of recovery in the short term and \nimprove the resilience of the economy. To improve revenue collection, administration, and tax \nservice delivery, policy actions will include (i) submission to Parliament of property tax rates based \non the property valuation methodology and completion of policies, systems, and processes to \n                                                \n12 ADB. 2011.

The program will strengthen \ndevelopment  of  the  financial  sector  to  rebalance  growth  by  promoting  an  investment-driven \neconomy in the medium term, and to reorient and diversify the economic base in the long term. \nFor development of capital markets, policy actions will include (i) strengthening of the NPPF \nthrough  risk-based  investment  guidelines,  Cabinet  approval  of  the  National  Pension  Policy, \napproval of the NPPF strategic plan, and increase in NPPF membership by at least 5%; (ii) \neffectiveness of regulations for the public issue of shares; (iii) conducting a feasibility study on \nestablishing a securities and exchange commission; (iv) approval and starting implementation of \nBhutanese  Accounting  Standards  and  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards;20 and  (v) \nconducting a feasibility study on securitizing Bhutan\u2019s hydropower revenues to strengthen the \ngovernment\u2019s capacity for infrastructure financing. For promotion of financial inclusion, policy \nactions  will  involve  (i)  approval  of  regulations  for  branchless  banking  and  deposit-taking \nmicrofinance, (ii) implementation by the Bhutan Development Bank Limited21 of Gewog banking \nservices in non-urban areas,22 and (iii) implementation of a financial literacy program with a focus \non gender equity. For improving CIB, policy actions will include (i) approval of  a regulatory \nframework for CIB, (ii) establishment of an oversight unit for the credit reporting system, and (iii) \napproval and implementation of a business plan to strengthen the organization and operation of \nCIB. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n \n20.  Bhutan has (i) limited domestic savings to finance investment, (ii) a low tax base for \nsignificantly increasing public revenue, and (iii) limitations of fiscal deficit and debt targets under \nthe medium-term fiscal framework. Under the circumstances, the government has adopted a \npolicy of financing its capital and infrastructure expenditures through external concessional loans \nand grants, while using domestic revenues to finance current expenditure.23 \n                                                \n18 These enhanced disclosure requirements are in line with Basel III core principles. \n19 A more streamlined framework will be implemented in line with the new prudential liquidity standards of the Basel \n \nCommittee on Banking Supervision. \n20 With the early adoption of an additional 26 Bhutanese Accounting Standards and International Financial Reporting \nStandards, the standards are harmonized with international norms.  \n21 Bhutan Development Bank Limited provides mobile and branchless financial services, particularly for underserved \ngroups, such as rural women. \n22 Gewog refers to a group of villages in Bhutan. \n23 Bhutan\u2019s debt stock is related to the hydropower development. Capacity addition of 10,000 megawatts is targeted \nthrough construction of 10 hydropower projects by 2020. Six of these projects are proposed to be funded under \nbilateral agreements with India on a 70:30 loan-to-grant basis and four projects are commercial joint ventures \nbetween public sector companies in both countries. Based on debt sustainability analysis under SEMP I and the July \n2014 IMF Article IV consultation report, Bhutan\u2019s debt dynamics (including hydropower loans) are classified as \n\u201cmoderate risk.\u201d For the debt portfolio and debt service requirements, there is sufficient hedge against the risks due to \nfavorable financing arrangements with India and strong economic returns from these hydropower projects. \n ", "6 \n \n21.  In  line  with  this  policy,  the  government\u2019s  development  financing  need  at  the  broad \nmacroeconomic level is projected to be $85.5 million, which is the resource gap between FY2015 \nand FY2017 (Table 1).24 It is proposed that ADB covers $36.2 million (42% of the gap) under \nSEMP II and the remaining $49.3 million will be financed by the government. 25  \n \nTable 1: Overall Fiscal Deficit and Development Financing Needs \nFY2014  FY2015  FY2016  FY2017  Total \nItem  (Revised)  (Budget)  (Projection)  (Projection)  FY2015\u2013FY2017  \nFiscal balance                \n         Nu million  (4,601.6)  (3,447.1)  (1,278.2)   135.8   (4,589.5) \n         $ million  (77.1)  (53.2)  (18.9)   1.9   (70.1) \nNet borrowing           \n         Nu million  66.2  (1,358.1)  371.6  9.7  (976.9) \n         $ million  1.1  (21.0)  5.5  0.1  (15.3) \nResource gap               \n          Nu million  (4,535.4)  (4,805.2)  (906.6)   145.4   (5,566.4) \n          $ million  (76.0)  (74.2)  (13.4)   2.1   (85.5) \nExchange rate           \n          Nu/$  59.7  64.8  67.8  70.9   \n( ) = negative, FY = fiscal year.  \nNote: Revised estimates are as of 31 March 2014.  \nSources: FY2014, FY2015, net borrowing and exchange rate are from Government of Bhutan, Ministry of Finance. \n2014.

The government has requested a loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR14,443,000 \n($20.1 million) and a grant not exceeding $16.1 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to \nhelp finance the program.26 The loan will have a 24-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, \nan interest rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. The \nloan  and  grant  will  have  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  financing \nagreement.27  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n23.  The Department of Public Accounts (DPA) of the Ministry of Finance will be the executing \nagency. It will oversee and coordinate timely implementation of the policy actions. DPA will be \nresponsible  for  overall  administration  of  the  program  and  the  TA,  disbursements,  and \nmaintenance of all program records. A program steering committee, comprising representatives \nfrom the implementing agencies, will be set up and chaired by the secretary and/or joint secretary \nof the Ministry of Finance.28  It will meet quarterly to monitor progress. ADB will monitor program \nimplementation  through  periodic  progress  reports,  submitted  by  DPA,  and  will  field  regular \nmissions to confirm the fulfillment of policy actions for tranche releases. ADB and the World Bank \n                                                \n24 The resource gap, which is the sum of the fiscal balance and net borrowing, reflects the financing requirement of the \ntotal outlay, which could not be met from available domestic resources including grants and planned net borrowing.  \n25 Combined with SEMP II, an additional World Bank development policy credit of $20 million, to be disbursed in \nFY2016, will finance 66% of the estimated resource gap. The government will then finance the remaining $29.3 \nmillion. For details of the development financing need based on fiscal projections, see Economic and Financial \nAnalysis; and Indicative Estimate of Impact from Revenue Reforms (both accessible from the list of linked documents \nin Appendix 2).  \n26 A country's eligibility for Asian Development Fund grants under the revised grant framework is determined by its risk \nof debt distress. The latest debt sustainability analysis determined that Bhutan has a moderate risk of debt distress \nand is therefore eligible to receive 50% of its Asian Development Fund allocation as grants. \n27 Financing Agreement (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n28 The implementing agencies are Bhutan Development Bank Limited, CIB, the Department of Revenue and Customs, \nDPA, the Ministry of Finance, NPPF, the Registrar of Companies, and the Royal Monetary Authority. \n ", "7 \nwill  continue  coordination  to  ensure  no  overlap  or  duplication  of  activities  during  program \nimplementation.  \n \n24.  Tranches, disbursement, and counterpart funds. The program has two tranches. The \ngrant will be disbursed as the first tranche upon effectiveness of the draft financing agreement \n(expected in June 2015), which will be conditional upon achievement of the first tranche policy \nactions. The loan will be disbursed as the second tranche upon achievement of the second \ntranche policy actions (expected to be no later than 18 months after disbursement of the first \ntranche). The proceeds of the loan and the grant will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nsimplification of disbursement procedures and related requirements for policy-based loans and \ngrants.29 The proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange cost of items produced and \nprocured in ADB member countries, excluding items included in a list of ineligible items and \nimports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources.30 Local currency generated from the \nloan and grant will be deposited into the government\u2019s budget fund account with the Bank of \nBhutan  Limited  to  provide  supplementary  financing  for  the  budget.  The  program  will  be \nimplemented over a period of 18 months. The disbursement of the loan and grant proceeds will be \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time to time) \nand detailed arrangements agreed upon between the government and ADB. ADB will have the \nright to audit the use of the proceeds and verify the accuracy of the government\u2019s certification.  \n \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n25.  The attached capacity development TA is proposed to support program implementation. \nThe TA outputs will mirror major policy actions under the program and strengthen the capacity of \nkey institutions responsible for implementing the reforms.31 The TA is estimated to cost $800,000, \nof which $700,000 will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund \n(TASF-V). The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office \nand housing accommodation, office supplies, secretarial assistance, domestic transportation, and \nother in-kind contributions.  \n \n26.  DPA  will  be  the  executing  agency,  and  will  oversee  and  coordinate  the  timely \nimplementation  of  TA  activities  through  the  program  steering  committee.  The  TA  will  be \nimplemented over 18 months from the disbursement of the first tranche (expected in June 2015) \nuntil the disbursement of the second tranche (expected no later than December 2016). It will \nrequire a total of 15 person-months of international consultancy services and 12 person-months of \nnational consultancy services intermittently. Consultants will be recruited, using the quality- and \ncost-based selection method with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10 due to the highly specialized \nexpertise needed, in line with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended \nfrom time to time). All disbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with ADB's \nTechnical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nProcurement will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as \namended from time to time).  \n \n \n \n                                                \n29 ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila.  \n30 List of Ineligible Items (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). Loan and grant proceeds \ndisbursed against imports will require a certificate from the government stipulating that, in a given year, the value of \nthe total imports of Bhutan, minus its imports from non-member countries, ineligible imports, and imports financed \nunder other official development assistance, is greater than the amount of the loan and the grant expected to be \ndisbursed in such year. ADB will have the right to audit the use of the loan and grant proceeds and to verify the \naccuracy of the government\u2019s certification. \n31 Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial  \n27.  By  enhancing  tax  collection  through  modernization  of  the  tax  administration  with  the \nRAMIS, improving tax compliance and service delivery through a taxpayer information call center, \nand lowering the dependence of local governments on central transfers through mobilization of \nrevenues from property taxes, the program\u2019s revenue management reforms  are expected to \nreinforce a sustainable fiscal trajectory.32 Reflecting the impact of the reforms under SEMP II, \ndomestic revenues are expected to increase progressively by FY2017. The fiscal balance to GDP \nratio is projected to improve to a deficit of 0.9% in FY2016 from a deficit of 2.7% in FY2015, and \nturn to a modest surplus of 0.1% in FY2017 (Table 2). The creation of fiscal space will enable the \ngovernment to devote more resources on a sustainable basis for capital spending and social \nprograms that are critical for inclusive growth. Revenue management reforms will help Bhutan \nmaintain a smaller resource gap and manage any recurring development financing needs more \neffectively after program implementation (Table 1). \n \nTable 2: Fiscal Indicators \n($ million) \nFY2013  FY2014  FY2015  FY2016  FY2017 \nItem  (Actual)  (Revised)  (Budget)  Projection  Projection \nDomestic revenue (tax and non-tax)  355.1  366.5  379.6  397.6  427.1 \nCurrent expenditure   304.5  322.9  337.9  358.2  365.0 \nCapital expenditure   310.1  341.3  234.6  323.7  316.3 \nFiscal balance (% of GDP)  (4.1)  (4.0)  (2.7)  (0.9)  0.1 \nReal GDP growth (%)  3.5  4.0  6.8  5.2  5.1 \n( ) = negative, FY = fiscal year, GDP = gross domestic product. \nSources: GDP growth for FY2013 and FY2014 are from Country Economic Indicators (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2).

Domestic revenue, current \nand capital expenditures, and fiscal balance for FY2016 and FY2017 are Asian Development Bank projections from \nIndicative Estimate of Impact from Revenue Reforms (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).              \n \n28.  Reforms for macroprudential management will enhance financial stability by establishing \neffective and permanent systems for cash forecasting and domestic debt management, and \nmonitoring of financial indicators through liquidity management, stress testing, and risk-based \nregulatory and supervisory oversight of financial institutions. These reforms will enable proactive \nmanagement of macrofinancial risks and improve resilience of the economy against economic \nshocks. Reforms targeting financial sector development will help rebalance Bhutan\u2019s economy \ntoward investment and reorient the economic base to private sector development. The program \nwill strengthen the regulatory and institutional framework for efficient financial intermediation. \nIntroduction of a legal framework for microfinance institutions and branchless banking, outreach of \ntechnology-based financial services to underserved communities in rural areas, and a financial \nliteracy program will enhance financial inclusion, and savings mobilization. The strengthening of \nCIB will improve access to finance and the business climate for entrepreneurs. \n \nB.  Governance \n29.  The governance risk assessment was conducted as part of the ADB\u2019s country partnership \nstrategy.33 The assessment  does not identify any serious governance risks  related to public \n                                                \n32 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n33 A summary of the governance risk assessment is available in the risk assessment and risk management plan of \nADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2014\u20132018 for Bhutan (footnote 15). \n ", "9 \nfinancial management, procurement, and corruption at the executing level. The program will \nsupport policy actions and capacity development that address vulnerabilities for public financial \nmanagement  by  (i)  improving  cash  forecasting,  including  reliable  revenue  projections;  (ii) \ndeveloping systems for effective debt management, including the government debt securities \nmarket; (iii) improving the local and national tax administration; and (iv) strengthening financial \nstability monitoring, including liquidity management and stress testing of the financial sector. \nThese reforms will strengthen fiduciary arrangements for efficient utilization of public resources. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the \ngovernment and DPA. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, implementation of the \nprogram  will  adhere  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Implementing  the  Second  Governance  and \nAnticorruption Action Plan (2014). \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n30.  Although Bhutan\u2019s record of poverty reduction has been strong in the last decade, the \nimprovement of the general quality of life has been accompanied by rising vulnerabilities such as \naccelerating rural\u2013urban migration, widening income inequality, and rising youth unemployment \nbecause of the narrow economic base. In addition, in the absence of a strong social security \nsystem,  risks  of  cyclical  downturns  and  external  economic  shocks  have  made  protection  of \nvulnerable groups more difficult. From this perspective, the program will have a positive impact on \npoverty and social issues. The program will improve the management of the economy, which is \nnecessary to achieve a stable and sustainable growth trajectory, and in turn allow for effective \nallocation of public resources to achieve development goals and provide critical public services for \nthe poor and other vulnerable groups such as women. By strengthening financial institutions and \nCIB, the program will improve the enabling environment for private sector development, which is \ncritical for employment generation and poverty reduction. The program\u2019s emphasis on introducing \nmobile and branchless banking services will extend the reach of financial services to remote \nareas. The financial literacy program will strengthen the financial inclusion by creating awareness \nof access to formal financial services among various socioeconomic, demographic, and gender \ngroups in Bhutan; and the culture of savings and responsible personal financial management.34  \n \nD.  Safeguards \n31.  Program activities are confined to policy and institutional reforms. None of the activities will \nresult  in  or  lead  to  involuntary  resettlement  or  affect  indigenous  peoples.  No  adverse \nenvironmental impacts have been identified. Safeguard categories for environment, involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples are all C. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n32.  The program is categorized as low risk as (i) the size of the program loan is less than $50 \nmillion;  (ii)  ADB  has  a  sound  record  with  previous  experience  in  the  sector  in  Bhutan;  \n(iii) DPA, the proposed executing agency, has a good performance record for externally financed \nproject implementation; and (iv) the program is unlikely to have any impact on safeguards. The \nintegrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. Major risks that could affect \nprogram implementation and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 3 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.35  \n \n \n                                                \n34 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n35 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \n \nTable 3: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nPublic financial management  Strengthening of systems and institutions under SEMP II for cash \nforecasting, debt management, tax administration and financial \nstability monitoring  \nWeak implementation capacity  Technical assistance provided to improve the capacity of the \nof government agencies  implementing agencies \nInadequate coordination among  Establishment of a program steering committee for proper \ngovernment agencies   coordination \nTrained staff are not retained  Engagement with the government to stress the importance of staff \nduring program implementation  continuity and capacity building of junior staff to develop expertise and \nknowledge at all levels \nSEMP II = Strengthening Economic Management Program II. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n33.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the program shall conform to all \napplicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, gender, \nprocurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the draft financing \nagreement. The government has agreed with ADB on covenants for the program, which are set \nforth in the draft financing agreement. The grant will become effective after all conditions for the \nrelease of the first tranche, as specified in the policy matrix and set out in the draft financing \nagreement, have been complied with.
