INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  Through this knowledge and support technical assistance (TA), the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) will provide a financial contribution to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for its \nnew Caucasus, Central Asia, and Mongolia Technical Assistance Center (CCAMTAC). The center \nwill undertake capacity development in macroeconomic-related areas for Armenia, Azerbaijan, \nGeorgia, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and \nother beneficiary countries that may be added in the future.1 The CCAMTAC will be physically \nestablished in Almaty, Kazakhstan by late 2021, but its remote capacity building activities will start \nfrom 1 January 2021 to respond to emerging needs for macroeconomic policy advice during the \ncoronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. The first phase of the CCAMTAC will run from 2021 \nto 2026. A center coordinator (an experienced IMF staff member) will manage the CCAMTAC, \nbackstopped by the IMF\u2019s departments concerned2 and guided by a steering committee from the \nIMF, member countries, and external partners including ADB. IMF resident advisors and short-\nterm experts will deliver the CCAMTAC\u2019s capacity development. In 2020, the IMF asked ADB for \na financial contribution of $800,000 to support the first phase of the CCAMTAC, whose total \n \nbudget is proposed to be $45 million.\n \n2.  The design of the proposed TA draws upon IMF\u2019s program document for the first phase \nof  the  CCAMTAC.  The  TA  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030\u2019s  operational  priority  on \nstrengthening governance and institutional capacity by addressing macro-fiscal stability, public \nfinancial  management  including  debt  sustainability,  and  adequate  fiscal  space  for  service \ndelivery.3 The TA is not included in any country operations business plans because it is regional.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Countries in the region face significant debt management challenges. Mongolia\u2019s external \ndebt started to rise after the global financial crisis of 2008\u20132009 and exceeded 200% of gross \ndomestic product (GDP) by 2015. While the country\u2019s external debt-to-GDP ratio has declined \nsince then, it has remained above 200%. The oil price shock in 2014\u20132015 widened fiscal deficits \nand increased public debt and external debt in the Caucasus and Central Asia. This impact was \nfelt by oil-exporting countries, such as Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, as well as oil-importing \ncountries, such as Armenia and the Kyrgyz Republic, with close links to the oil exporters as key \ntrading partners and sources of remittance. For all countries in the Caucasus and Central Asia, \ntheir governments\u2019 gross debt averaged 17.1% of GDP for 2000\u20132014 but increased to 26.3% by \n2019. In the same period, the gross total external debt of these countries increased from 54.3% \nto 68.2% of GDP. External debt has also been rising in relation to gross national income (figure). \nThese countries are vulnerable to exogenous shocks, which could have profound implications for \ntheir public finances and economies. Their capacity to design and implement effective fiscal, \nmonetary, and exchange rate policies and financial sector regulations and supervision remains \nlimited.  \n \n4.  The outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020 and lower oil prices have put significant pressure on \nlocal currencies and sovereign spreads, revenues, and public expenditures in the Caucasus and \n \n1  This TA report was primarily based on IMF\u2019s program document for the CCAMTAC\u2019s Phase I: IMF. 2020.

Manila. \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 28 September 2020. \n ", "2 \nCentral Asia. Countries in the Caucasus, Central Asia, and Mongolia (CCAM) face the dual \nchallenges of increased debt vulnerabilities and managing fiscal space for infrastructure and \nsocial expenditure with prudent expenditure control and enhanced domestic revenue mobilization. \nA related challenge is containing contingent liabilities that arise from lending by state-owned \ncommercial  banks  to  state-owned  enterprises,  pointing  to  the  need  for  stronger  banking \nsupervision. In addition, some economies in the region have reformed their monetary policy \nregime to allow for greater exchange rate flexibility, but the currency depreciation that followed \nincreased the domestic currency value of external debt. Strengthening institutions, macro-fiscal \nframeworks, and statistics will be essential to support (i) better analysis, planning, and targeting \nof expenditures; (ii) risk identification and management; and (iii) communication of objectives and \npolicies. Thus, the capacity of countries in the CCAM region for sound macroeconomic and debt \nmanagement needs to be enhanced. Among multilateral institutions, the IMF has a specific \nmandate  to  address  macroeconomic  issues  and  is  best  placed  to  address  such  capacity \ndevelopment needs in related areas.  \n \n \nExternal Debt Stock\n(% of gross national income)\n300\n250\n200\n150\n100\n50\n0\n2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019\nArmenia Azerbaijan Georgia\nKazakhstan Kyrgyz Republic Mongolia\nTajikistan Turkmenistan Uzbekistan\n \n      Note: Turkmenistan data for 2019 not available. \nSource: Word Bank\u2019s World Development Indicators database. https://data.worldbank.org/ (accessed on            \n22 October 2020).   \n          \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n5.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: living standards improved by achieving higher \nand inclusive growth in a sustainable manner (footnote 1). The TA will have the following outcome: \nrobust growth with debt sustainability restored in countries in the CCAM region.5 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n6.  Through ADB\u2019s financial contribution to the CCAMTAC, the proposed TA will provide \ncapacity development for CCAM countries to pursue robust growth with sound debt sustainability. \nThe CCAMTAC will provide capacity development services to all nine developing member \ncountries in the CCAM region and other beneficiary countries that may be added in the future. In \n \n5  The objectives and monitoring indicators for CCAMTAC\u2019s first phase are summarized in the logical framework \ndeveloped by the IMF; its core element are reflected in this TA\u2019s design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). \n ", "3 \nthe first phase of its operations, 2021\u20132026, the center will cover six priority areas identified in \nthe  program  document  developed  by  the  IMF:  public  financial  management,  revenue \nadministration,  monetary  policy,  financial  sector  supervision,  macroeconomic  statistics,  and \nmacroeconomic framework. The envisaged outputs of the first phase of CCAMTAC\u2019s program are \npresented in the box.6  \nInternational Monetary Fund\u2019s Caucasus, Central Asia, and Mongolia Technical Assistance \nCenter Envisaged Outputs for Phase I, 2021\u20132026 \n \nOutput 1: Core public financial management functions strengthened, and progressively more \nadvanced public financial management practices and systems introduced. Public financial \nmanagement activities will focus on strengthening medium-term fiscal framework processes for \nbudget preparation; infrastructure governance; budget execution and control; coverage and quality \nof fiscal reporting; monitoring, management, and disclosure of fiscal risks; fiscal transparency \npractices; and cash and debt management.  \n \nOutput 2: Macroeconomic and financial statistics compilation and dissemination for decision \nmaking improved. Capacity development activities will aim to enhance the quality, timeliness, and \naccessibility of macroeconomic statistics, including national accounts and price statistics, for \ndecision  making.  In  government  finance  statistics,  support  will  aim  to  strengthen  coverage, \ncompilation, and dissemination of government and public debt statistics. In external sector statistics, \nthe assistance will focus on enhancing the coverage and compilation of internationally comparable \nbalance of payments, the international investment position, and external debt statistics.  \n \n  Output 3: Macroeconomic forecasting and policy analysis capacity at relevant institutions to \nsupport  the  economic  policy-making  process  enhanced.  Strengthening  macroeconomic \nforecasting and analytical capacity along with supporting analytical tools will help countries in the \nCCAM region improve macroeconomic and macro-fiscal forecasting ability, credibility, and policy \nanalysis, as well as help them identify and mitigate macroeconomic risks. It will also provide a sound \nbasis  for  policy  formulation  by  better  linking  monetary  and  fiscal  policies  to  consistent \nmacroeconomic scenarios, improved medium-term macroeconomic frameworks and supporting \ninstitutional arrangements, analytical tools, and communications outputs and channels.  \n \nOutput 4: Tax administration management and governance arrangements improved. Revenue \nadministration  activities  will  focus  on  supporting  strategic  planning,  bolstering  organizational \nstructures and performance management, identifying and mitigating compliance risks across taxes \nand taxpayer segments, and integrating information technology solutions and third-party information \nsources. \n \nOutput 5. Capacity of the central bank to implement monetary policy effectively in the context \nof  the  given  monetary  policy  regime  strengthened.  Capacity  development  will  focus  on \nstrengthening the capacity of central banks in the countries of the CCAM region to implement \nmonetary policy and conduct foreign exchange operations effectively in order to achieve slow and \nstable inflation and to foster financial sector stability, development, and inclusion.  \n \nOutput 6. Banking regulations and prudential norms enhanced. Capacity development will \ndevelop  and/or  strengthen  banking  regulation  and  prudential  norms,  implement  risk-based \nsupervision systems, and upgrade other supervisory processes.  \n \n    Source: IMF. 2020. Caucasus, Central Asia and Mongolia Regional Capacity Development Center Program \nDocument: Phase I, 2021\u20132026.  Washington, DC.   \n \n \n \n6  Annual work plans under the first 5-year phase of CCAMTAC will describe specific, measurable milestones of \nmultiyear projects in dedicated logical frameworks. The range of topics covered by the center will be adjusted as \ncountry needs evolve before and during the first phase and in subsequent phases.  \n ", "4 \n7.  Debt management will be addressed directly under two priority areas at the CCAMTAC: \npublic financial management (PFM) and macroeconomic statistics. Sound expenditure control \nand availability of public debt statistics are essential to preserving the sustainability of public debt. \nThe CCAMTAC is expected to deliver extensive capacity development in these key areas. The \nCCAMTAC\u2019s other priority areas will also help debt management indirectly. Enhanced revenue \nadministration should help shrink fiscal deficits, reducing the need to resort to debt. Monetary and \nexchange rate policy and banking supervision are vital for sustainability of external debt (including \nborrowing by the private sector). While most capacity development activities will be in countries \nin the CCAM region, some training sessions could be in other countries or other IMF regional TA \ncenters. The CCAMTAC will also facilitate regional and bilateral workshops and seminars to \nachieve greater peer-to-peer exchange and learning among its member countries.  \n \n8.  The TA responds to the call by the Group of Twenty (G20) to enhance collaboration for \ncapacity  development  between  the  IMF  and  multilateral  development  banks  (MDBs).  The \nprinciples adopted by the G20 members in March 2017 state: \u201cThe IMF and MDBs should [...] \nenhance coordination around provision of technical assistance and capacity building, especially \nfor low-income countries, in order to reinforce their capacity to anticipate, analyze and respond to \na  crisis.\u201d7 The  proposed  TA  would  signify  such  collaboration  among  international  financial \ninstitutions.  \n \n9.  For countries in the Caucasus and Central Asia, ADB envisages providing policy-based \nlending and TA in several of the CCAMTAC\u2019s priority areas, including PFM and finance sector \nreforms. The CCAMTAC\u2019s support activities are expected to contribute to reform prioritization, \ndesign, and implementation under these policy-based lending operations. The CCAMTAC may \nalso contribute to ADB\u2019s crisis response operations through special policy-based lending and the \ncountercyclical support facility. Further, the TA will enrich policy dialogue in the economic and \nfinancial stability cluster of the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation program, which is \nimplemented together by ADB, the IMF, and the World Bank. The program\u2019s secretariat will \nattempt to engage with the CCAMTAC to promote regional policy dialogue and deliver joint \nknowledge, training, and capacity building events.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n10.  The TA is estimated to cost $800,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund ($300,000 TASF-6 and $500,000 TASF-other sources). The \nkey expenditures are listed in Appendix 2.  \n \n11.  The CCAMTAC\u2019s proposed budget for the first phase is $45 million. The budget will be \nfinanced by the IMF, the host country (Kazakhstan), other CCAM countries, and donor partners \nand other development partners including ADB. Kazakhstan has committed to cover nearly half \nof the externally financed portion of the budget ($20 million). All other CCAMTAC member \ncountries are expected to provide a financial contribution to demonstrate ownership and ensure \nsustainability.  The  IMF\u2019s  contribution  will  be  about  $3.3  million  over  5  years  to  cover  the \ncoordinator\u2019s salary, benefits, and residence.  \n \n \n7  \u201cG20 Principles for effective coordination between the IMF and MDBs in case of countries requesting financing while \nfacing macroeconomic vulnerabilities, March 2017\u201d and their implementation status are presented in Staffs of the \nInternational Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the Inter-American Development Bank. 2018.

ADB will delegate TA implementation and transfer the funds to the IMF. The IMF is the \nexecuting agency and the CCAMTAC is the implementing agency. ADB and the IMF will sign a \nletter of understanding that governs the transfer of funds from ADB to IMF for the CCAMTAC \nactivities.  The  IMF  will  be  responsible  for  the  CCAMTAC\u2019s  managerial,  technical,  and \nadministrative arrangements, while ADB will add value by acting as a member of the steering \ncommittee that endorses the annual work programs and monitors the CCAMTAC\u2019s progress. \nEstablished in 1945, the IMF's primary purpose is to ensure stability of the international monetary \nsystem\u2014the system of exchange rates and international payments that enables countries (and \ntheir citizens) to transact with each other. The IMF's mandate was updated in 2012 to include all \nmacroeconomic and finance sector issues that impact global stability. \n \n13.  Procurement and human resources management. Procurement will be from the IMF\u2019s \n189 member countries in accordance with the IMF\u2019s guidelines and procedures.8 The IMF will \nidentify, employ, and manage the human resources. The CCAMTAC will be staffed by resident \nadvisors (long-term experts), who will be selected and hired by the IMF based on technical \ncompetence, management capacity, and experience. The IMF will define the terms of reference.9 \nThe long-term experts will be supported by short-term experts, who will assist with specific \ncapacity development engagements in the CCAMTAC countries.10 ADB\u2019s Board of Directors will \nconsider the TA because of the following: (i) a waiver of section 3.04(iii) of the Regulations of the \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF) 11 to permit the use of TASF resources to finance \nexpenditures in non-member countries, as set out in para. 21 of this TA report12; and (ii) the use \nof IMF\u2019s procurement guidelines and procedures instead of ADB\u2019s procurement procedures.13 \n \n14.  Transfer of funds and disbursement. ADB funding will be provided in one installment to \nthe IMF upon effectiveness of the letter of understanding and pooled with funds from other \ndevelopment partners. The IMF\u2019s subaccount will be used to receive and disburse financial \ncontributions for the CCAMTAC\u2019s activities. All resources contributed to the subaccount will be \nfor the sole use of the CCAMTAC. The IMF will manage the subaccount in accordance with its \nfinancial regulations and other applicable IMF practices and procedures in lieu of ADB\u2019s TA \nDisbursement Handbook.14  \n \n15.  Implementation period. The TA will be implemented from December 2020 to January \n2026, exceeding 5 years to cover CCAMTAC\u2019s first phase (tentatively planned from 1 January \n2021 to 1 January 2026) and its preparatory phase in December 2020. The CCAMTAC will start \noperating formally and virtually on 1 January 2021, shortly after an initial steering committee \n \n8  Information  on  procurement  activities  by  the  IMF  is  available  on  its  website:    \nhttps://www.imf.org/external/np/procure/eng/index.htm. \n9  Indicative terms of reference are accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3. \n10 The work of the coordinator and long-term experts will be supported by an office manager, assistants, a local security \ncoordinator, and other personnel (e.g., driver, translators). The CCAMTAC may engage a local economist or research \nassistant. The IMF will select the local staff on an open, competitive basis.   \n11 Section 3.04 (iii) of the Regulations of the TASF provides the following: \u201cExcept as otherwise provided in or permitted \nby these Regulations, the resources of the Fund may be used to finance expenditures in the territories of any member \ncountry of the Bank \u2026 for services and facilities supplied from such territories.\u201d \n12 The Board of Directors must approve the waiver by a vote representing not less than two-thirds of the total voting \npower of the members of the Board. \n13 ADB. 2017.

The IMF\u2019s policies, rules, \nand regulations will apply to the activities financed and the administration of resources under the subaccount. The \nCCAMTAC is an office of the IMF without a separate legal personality distinct from the IMF. The IMF will charge 7% \nmanagement fees on each contribution to the subaccount. \n ", "6 \nmeeting in December 2020. The virtual opening will help meet the increased demand for the IMF\u2019s \nTA to respond to COVID-19 and oil price shocks in the region. The center is expected to physically \nopen by late 2021. By December 2020, the IMF will recruit the center coordinator to work with \ncountries in the CCAM region, build detailed work plans with each of them, and finalize the \nphysical preparations (real estate, equipment) for the center.

Reporting, evaluation, and audit. The IMF will keep ADB informed on the progress of \nthe activities under the subaccount by posting once a year on the IMF\u2019s external portal to which \neach contributor has access (i) a financial statement regarding the operations and transactions \nunder the subaccount,15 (ii) a progress report, and (iii) a list of key decisions taken at the annual \nsteering committee meeting. The IMF will prepare annual reports to monitor the progress on the \nmilestones envisaged in capacity development projects and to identify obstacles and potential \nactions to optimize performance. The operations and transactions during the IMF\u2019s financial year \nwill be audited as part of the IMF\u2019s framework administered account16; the external audit report \nwill be posted on the IMF\u2019s external website as part of the IMF\u2019s Annual Report. The CCAMTAC \nwill also be subject to audits by the IMF\u2019s Office of Internal Audit. In line with IMF policy, an \nindependent external evaluation of the CCAMTAC will take place no later than 40 months after \nits activities have begun. The evaluation will assess effectiveness and sustainability, bearing in \nmind the long-term nature of capacity building. It will formulate advice for improvement to inform \ndiscussions on the CCAMTAC\u2019s future operations.  \n \n17.  Social media and websites. The CCAMTAC will create a website with frequently updated \ninformation on TA and training. Twitter and Facebook will serve as key outlets for social media to \nbroaden the target audience. The center will distribute a newsletter to member countries and \ndevelopment partners and post it on its website and through social media to enable news of \ncapacity development activities to reach a broader audience. \n \n18.  The  IMF  has  a  global  network  of  16  regional  capacity  development  centers.  Its \nindependent external evaluations have consistently given these centers high marks for quality of \nadvice and training, as well as speed and flexibility of response to member-country needs. The \nTA implementation arrangement follows the successful model established by ADB\u2019s previous \n \n15 The financial statement is expected to help ensure that ADB\u2019s contribution, together with other contributions to the \nsubaccount, are used for the purposes approved for activities of the CCAMTAC. \n16 The administration of resources and the activities financed under the subaccount will be governed by the Instrument \nfor a Framework Administered Account for Selected Fund Activities. \n ", "7 \ncontribution to the IMF\u2019s Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC). Since 1994, \nADB has provided $7.2 million to the PFTAC under 11 consecutive regional TA projects.17 One \nof the challenges for the PFTAC has been that a large number of countries are covered by a small \nnumber of advisors, both on the side of the PFTAC and of other development partners, which \nlimits resources available for coordination. To overcome the resource constraint for the CCAM \nregion, ADB will provide additional TA for debt management while avoiding duplication with the \nCCAMTAC. Whereas the CCAMTAC addresses debt management from a broad macroeconomic \npoint  of  view,  ADB\u2019s  TA  will  cover  more  specific  technical  issues  unique  to  public  debt \nmanagement.  \n \nE.  Governance \n \n19.   The CCAMTAC will be governed according to the IMF\u2019s overall framework for regional \ncapacity development centers. The CCAMTAC will be guided by a steering committee comprising \nthe  IMF,  country  representatives,  and  development  partners  including  ADB.  The  steering \ncommittee will provide strategic guidance and identify priorities, endorse the annual work plan \nand budget, and review annual reports. The CCAMTAC may involve other stakeholders in the \nsteering  committee  meetings,  such  as  regional  or  international  organizations.  The  steering \ncommittee will be chaired by member countries on a rotating basis. Steering committee members \nare expected to provide feedback on the center\u2019s operations and help ensure that annual work \nplans (i) reflect member country needs\u2014through member country representatives, (ii) are well \ncoordinated with capacity development delivered by other providers\u2014through member country \nand  development  partner  representatives,  and  (iii)  are  well-integrated  with  other  capacity \ndevelopment, surveillance, and lending activities of the IMF.  \n \n20.  The CCAMTAC will be managed by a coordinator who is a senior IMF manager. The \ncoordinator is responsible for day-to-day management and operations, with strategic guidance \nfrom the steering committee and oversight from the IMF headquarters. The coordinator is \nresponsible  for  the  implementation  of  the  CCAMTAC  work  plan,  execution  of  its  budget, \nadministrative management of the resident advisors, and hiring and supervision of local staff. \nBased on the experience of ADB\u2019s previous financial contributions to the IMF, its financial \nmanagement, procurement, and corruption risks under the TA are considered low.18 The activities \nto be carried out under the TA will contribute to stronger PFM, procurement, and anticorruption \ncapabilities of developing member countries.  \n \nIV.
