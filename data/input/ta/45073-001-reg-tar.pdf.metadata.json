INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  Financial  sector  development  through  more  diversified  and  market-driven  financial \nproducts and services, with broad-based outreach in rural areas, is one of the strategic core \nareas  of  operation  for  inclusive  and  balanced  growth  under  Strategy  2020  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB).1 The  ADB  Operational  Plan  for  Food  Security  in  Asia  and  the \nPacific2 and the Financial Sector Operational Plan3 prioritize investments, policy reforms, and \ncapacity building to enhance the efforts of developing member countries (DMCs) to expand \nfinancial access for the traditionally underserved such as smallholder farms and small and \nmedium-sized  agro-enterprises  (SMAEs).  Consultations  with  ADB  regional  operations  and \nprivate  sector  departments  have  confirmed  that  access  to  finance  for  the  development  of \nagriculture and food value chains (AFVCs) is a widespread binding constraint. This regional \nresearch and development technical assistance (TA) is about bridging the knowledge gaps that \nimpede access to AFVC financing for smallholder farms and SMAEs.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  AFVCs are emerging in Asian DMCs, albeit at different paces. Important drivers of AFVC \ndevelopment  include  urbanization,  income  growth,  changing  dietary  preferences,  increased \nfemale labor force participation, and access to better household technologies and information \nabout food.5 A typology of AFVCs in terms of the nature and degree of vertical integration \nbetween and among the different actors in the chain includes (i) traditional AFVCs, which are \ntypified  by  their  weak  connection  and  involvement  of  many  players  in  the  production, \nprocessing, marketing, and distribution activities, resulting in numerous risks, huge transactions \ncosts, and low financing; (ii) transitional AFVCs, which have less player intermediation at the \npostharvest to market levels but have limited options for risk mitigation and financing; and \n(iii) modern AFVCs, which are characterized by stronger integration of the supply chain players \nthat  ensure  economies  of  scale  and  scope  through  seamless  logistics,  and  technical  and \nfinancial support,  as well as wide market outlets.6 The focus of many AFVC studies has been \non understanding the traditional and modern AFVCs. There is very limited knowledge of the \ntransitional  or  the  \u201cmiddle  AFVCs,\u201d  which  is  nonetheless  important  to  examine  as  these \nessentially  serve  as  the  transition  ladder  from  traditional  to  modern  types  of  AFVCs. \nUnderstanding  the  development  impacts  of  the  AFVCs\u2019  structural  transformations  on \nsmallholder farms and SMAEs would be a significant value addition to studying their contribution \nto inclusive growth.  \n \n3.  One of the major drivers that facilitate the transformation of AFVCs is the availability of \nand access to innovative financing. The types of value chain financing vary, depending on \nwhether the flow of financing is from within the chain segments, or between and among chain \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2008.

The  innovative  application  of  various  institutional,  contractual, \nmanagerial, and technological arrangements is also essential to adapt to the needs of AFVCs \nfor  stronger  and  more  demand-driven  value  chain  coordination.  Whether  these  novel \narrangements respond to the effective demand for AFVC financing of smallholder farms and \nSMAEs, and meet their investment threshold needs, will need to be examined.  \n \n4.  One of the major bottlenecks to promoting AFVC financing for smallholder farms and \nSMAEs is the poor business climate caused by multiple levels of government interventions that \ndiscourage or undermine private sector investments in AFVCs. At the macro level, monetary, \ntax,  trade  policies,  and  regulatory  measures  inhibit  the  development  of  different  financial \ninstruments and arrangements such as the use of warehouse receipts and lease arrangements. \nRestrictive marketing policies, commodity pricing controls, and poor quality standard regulations \nmay also disadvantage the competitiveness of AFVCs and the terms of trade against financing \nof AFVCs, and inhibit the diversification of activities within the chain. At the sector levels, some \nregulatory measures restrict the participation of private sector intermediaries such as insurance \nfirms and collateral managers. Weak measures for transparent, accountable, and enforceable \ncontracts also prevent the outreach and availability of AFVC financing instruments. At the micro \nlevel, constraints to the capacity development of grassroots organizations such as farmers\u2019 \ngroups,  chambers  of  SMAEs,  and  community-based  microfinance  institutions  impede  the \ngrowth  of  inclusive  and  sustainable  AFVC  financing.  Poor  local  public  governance  and \ninadequate measures for the fair treatment of all players disproportionately result in the weak \nbargaining leverage of smallholder farmers and SMAEs, and create mistrust between players.  \n \n5.  Creative solutions for inclusive and sustainable AFVC financing are emerging regionally, \nbut the majority of these experiences, such as contract farming, use of warehouse receipts, \nforward contracts, and marketing company credit, have difficulties for start-up, replication, or \nscaling up, especially in the low-income DMCs (Asian Development Fund [ADF] countries). A \nlarge  lacuna  has  been  on  technical  support  for  facilitating  the  development  of  innovative \napproaches that link smallholder farms and SMAEs to potential AFVC financial providers and \nmarkets. Specific technical support financing gaps are often in the areas that address critical but \nlow-cost, quick-disbursing expenses with high impact. These include (i) soft infrastructure build-\nup  (e.g., entrepreneurship  training,  governance  tool  kits,  and  conduct  of  market  studies); \n(ii) information  infrastructure  that  needs  opportunities  for  showcasing  or  trial  testing \n(e.g., software that facilitates traceability, and social networking among entrepreneurs in the \nchain);  (iii) institutional  arrangements  that  address  specific  risks  (e.g.,  poor  food  safety \nstandards); (iv) contractual or partnership agreements that need to be fine-tuned or tested \n(e.g., local government\u2013private partnerships); (v) a start-up fund for equipment or technology \n(e.g., environment-friendly  packaging,  small  technology  for  grading  and  assembling);  and \n(vi) database  or  knowledge  management  for  improving  logistics  and  information  sharing. \nProviding for these technical support needs may encourage the development of AFVC financing \n                                                \n7  These include product financing instruments such as trader credit, input supplier credit, marketing company credit, \nand risk mitigation instruments such as forward contracts. (C. Miller and L. Jones. 2010. Agricultural Value Chain \nFinance: Tools and Lessons. New Delhi: Practical Actions Publishing and Food and Agriculture Organization of the \nUnited Nations. \n8  Examples of value chain related financing instruments are receivables financing (factoring and forfeiting), physical \nasset collateralization such as warehouse receipts and repurchase agreement, and risk mitigation instruments \nsuch as weather-based insurance. Examples of financing that are not related to the value chain are securitization \ninstruments, microfinance, and joint venture finance.  \n ", "  3 \noptions for smallholder farms and SMAEs, and promote the transition from the traditional to \ntransitional and modern AFVCs. \n \n6.  Bridging the knowledge gaps between and across value chain actors and providers of \nAFVC financing is also important to broaden the outreach and availability of AFVC financing to \nsmallholder  farms  and  SMAEs  in  ADF  countries.  Utilization  of  technological  advances  in \ninformation and communication technology and the different social network arrangements may \nbe needed to reduce the knowledge gaps, and improve the take-up of innovations in AFVC \nfinancing for DMCs.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n7.  This  TA  addresses  the  knowledge  gaps  on  AFVC  financing,  with  the  end-view  of \nexpanding the outreach of AFVC financing to smallholder farms and SMAEs, especially in the \nADF countries. These DMCs are generally dependent on traditional AFVCs, and have identified \nweak access to credit by smallholder farms and SMAEs as major impediments for improved \nproductivity, market connectivity, and resilience to natural and economic shocks. Stronger and \ncoordinated AFVCs with a wider range of AFVC financing options will stimulate inclusive growth \nin these economies. Appendix 1 provides the design and monitoring framework of the TA.  \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The  expected  impact  by  2016  will  be  the  improved  access  to  AFVC  financing  for \nsmallholder farms and SMAEs in participating low-income DMCs. To achieve this impact, the \nTA\u2019s outcome will be the development of innovative AFVC financing framework.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA  will  have  three  outputs: (i)  submission  of  a  policy  report for inclusive  and \nsustainable AFVC financing to the Governments of Bangladesh and Cambodia, (ii) development \nof innovative AFVC finance business models for smallholder farms and SMAEs in participating \nlow  income  DMCs  for  deliberation  by  AFVC  financial  providers,  and  (iii)  application  of  a \nknowledge platform on innovative AFVC financing by selected DMCs.  \n \n10.  For output 1, a comprehensive literature review  will be conducted on the financing \nmodalities  and  products  for  AFVCs,  and  the  major  policy  and  institutional  bottlenecks  to \nensuring inclusive and sustainable AFVC financing and growth in Asia. A stacked survey and \nevidence-based case studies for different AFVC typologies and AFVC financing types will also \nbe  conducted.  Based  on  demand  and  supply  analysis  for  AFVC  financing,  policies  and \ninstitutional barriers will be studied in terms of inclusiveness, sustainability, and potentials for \nintegrated AFVCs using four country cases: the People\u2019s Republic of China and India, because \nof their expansive wealth of AFVC experiences; these will provide relevant insights to low-\nincome DMCs, Bangladesh (ADF-blend DMC) and Cambodia (ADF-only DMC).9 A strategic \nevidence-informed policy report for inclusive and sustainable AFVC financing will be produced \n                                                \n9  The People\u2019s Republic of China and India were selected due to the variety of good practices on AFVC financing for \nsmallholder farms and SMAEs that are in transitional and modern AFVCs phases. Examining their experiences will \nbenefit low income DMCs especially in terms of the policy environment that facilitates AFVC financing. Bangladesh \nand  Cambodia  were  also  selected  as  these  are  low-income  DMCs  with  prevalent  traditional  AFVCs.  The \nconstraints to AFVC financing in these countries will be assessed, and experiences from the first two countries will \nbe evaluated in identifying the drivers for inclusive and sustainable AFVC transformations.  \n ", "4   \nand disseminated in Bangladesh and Cambodia. A communications strategy will be done for \nadvocating reforms in key regional forums.  \n \n11.  For output 2, the methodology will be a combination of focus group discussions and pilot \ntesting. An assessment of commercial banks and other potential financial intermediaries of \nAFVCs will be conducted and an issues paper on market gaps for private sector financing of \nAFVCs  will  be  developed.  Focus  group  discussions  with  national  and  multinational \nagribusinesses,  retailers,  wholesalers,  banks,  microfinance  institutions,  nongovernment \norganizations, and other financial intermediaries will be held to discuss the issues paper and to \nprioritize the issues, challenges, and opportunities for AFVC financing for smallholders and \nSMAEs. On the basis of the selected issues, well-defined criteria, and a competitive selection \nprocess, there will be a call for proposals for technical support that will facilitate the start-up, \nreplication, or scale-up of innovative AFVC financing models for smallholder farms and SMAEs. \nThe country focus of the proposals will include, but not be limited to, Bangladesh and Cambodia. \nThe implementation of at least three to six of the best proposals will be closely monitored and \nperiodically evaluated. The proposals that have not been selected but merit dissemination will \nalso be published through a compendium of business case studies.   \n \n12.  For output 3, a review and assessment will be done of available knowledge platforms on \nAFVCs in Asia and the clients these serve. Information gaps and priority issues will be identified \nto explore possibilities for collaboration on knowledge platforms. A knowledge platform for \ninnovative AFVC financing of smallholder farms and SMAEs will be set up in Bangladesh and \nCambodia.  \n \n13.  The TA will culminate in a regional conference that will present the findings of the TA, \nand develop networks for the continued dissemination and utilization of its findings.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing     \n \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,500,000 equivalent to be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). Appendix 2 lists the cost items \nfor the proposed TA. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The TA will be implemented for about 24 months, from January 2012 to December 2013. \nADB, through its Regional and Sustainable Development Department, will be the executing \nagency, and will be responsible for the overall supervision of the TA to ensure the timely \ndelivery of quality outputs, and the attainment of the outcome and impact. It will work closely \nwith the communities of practice on agriculture, rural development, and food security, and \nfinancial sector development, as well as the ADB regional departments and the Private Sector \nOperations Department to ensure coordinated action on the policy measures and the application \nof the innovative and scalable financing of value chain models.  \n \n16.  For outputs 1 and 3, the TA will require the services of 16 person-months of international \nexperts and 24 person-months of national experts in the fields of food chain policies, food value \nchains, agribusiness finance, knowledge management, and information and communication. \nThe terms of reference for the consultants are outlined in Appendix 3. The consultants will be \nselected and engaged through a firm. The recruitment of consultants will be done through \nquality- and cost-based selection with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10 to ensure that the stacked \nsurvey methodology and case studies are rigorously done. The firms will submit simplified \n ", "  5 \ntechnical proposals. The consultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe  Use  of  Consultants  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  TA  proceeds  will  be \ndisbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as \namended from time to time). The selected consulting firm will hold an inception workshop within \n2 months of the TA\u2019s approval to provide a detailed work plan and milestones for each output. \nThe firm will submit the following reports to ADB: (i) an inception report, (ii) a midterm report, (iii) \na final report, (iv) semiannual financial statements, and (v) an audited annual financial statement. \nThe firm will also produce a book that provides the findings of the survey, case studies, and the \nstrategic policy and institutional reform agenda. Before starting proposed activities within a DMC, \nreceipt of no-objection letters from the governments of Bangladesh, Cambodia, the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China, and India will be required. \n \n17.  For output 2, the TA will require the services of 13 person-months of international \nexperts and 19 person-months of national experts. Expertise in the following areas will be \naccessed:  an  agribusiness  finance  specialist,  a  participatory  multi-stakeholder  facilitator,  a \nconference event coordinator, and an editor (Appendix 3 contains the terms of reference). An \nunallocated 2 person-months of international expert services are set aside in anticipation of \nother expert needs on AFVC financing and development for the pilot-testing activities such as \nfinance management, legal services, food packaging and labeling, and a risk insurance expert. \nThese expert needs will be determined during the selection of proposals for technical support. \nADB will recruit the consultants on an individual basis. Recruitment of individual consultants will \nbe in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.  \n \n18.  A steering committee will be established, comprising staff from ADB\u2019s Regional and \nSustainable Development Department, Private Sector Operations Department, and regional \noperations departments to oversee the conduct of the activities for output 2. Private sector and \nnongovernment organization representatives may be invited as resource persons to provide \nfeedback on the call for pilot-testing proposals and the selection process. The pilot-testing \nactivities may include proposals for the purchase of computers; and small equipment for farm \nproduction, postharvest, processing, storage, assembling, and packing. There may also be the \nneed for the conduct of small market and feasibility studies, training and capacity development, \naccess to social networks, development of tool kits, study tours, and access to advisory services. \nProcurement of goods and related services for the pilot-testing proposals will be in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). Disbursements will \nbe undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook.  \n  \n19.  The expected outputs of the TA will be disseminated through the regional conference, \nthe knowledge platform, and development networks. A book will be produced and disseminated, \ncontaining the results of the country cases and the compendium of innovative AFVC financing \nmodels. These  will  also  be  presented  in  strategic forums  and  development  websites. The \npublication of the book and compendium will be contracted by ADB\u2019s Department of External \nRelations.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \n \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,500,000 on a grant basis\nfor Innovative Financing for Agriculture and Food Value Chains, and hereby reports this action \nto the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData Sources and \nDesign   Performance Targets and  Assumptions and \nReporting \nSummary  Indicators with Baselines  Risks \nMechanisms \nImpact  By 2016     \nSmallholder farms  AFVC financing for  Country statistics  Assumption \nand SMAEs have  smallholder farms and  portal or government  Adequate public \nimproved access to  SMAEs in the participating  census  investments are made \nAFVC financing in  low income DMCs will    in infrastructure (roads, \nparticipating low- increase by 5%  Financial reports of  irrigation, power) and \nincome DMCsa by  (2011 baseline)  commercial financial  research and \n2016.     institutions in  development and \n  participating low  extension \n \n  income DMCs   \n  Risk \nRestrictive trade \nmeasures imposed by \nexporting countries \ndiscourage AFVC \nintegration \n \nOutcome  By 2013     Assumption \nInnovative AFVC  The TA\u2019s policy  Records of  Farmers and SMAEs \nfinancing framework  recommendations and AFVC  Governments of  respond to opportunities \ndeveloped.    financing models are  Bangladesh,  to adopt new \ndeliberated by the  Cambodia, and 2 of  institutional \nGovernments of  the Governments in  arrangements for \nBangladesh, Cambodia, and  participating low- financing \nat least 2 more Governments  income DMCs \nin the participating low   \nincome DMCs (baseline  Status report of the \nnone)  MDBs\u2019 Action Plan for \nImproved Coordination \nDevelopment partners and \non Food and Water \ndonors conduct joint policy \nSecurity   \ndialogues using the TA \nfindings in regional forums \n(2011 baseline) \nOutputs  By 2013    Assumption \n1.
