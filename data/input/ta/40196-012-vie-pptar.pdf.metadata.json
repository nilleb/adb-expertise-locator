Justification \n1.  The  Government  of  Viet  Nam  has  requested  financing  by  ADB  and  an  (as  yet \nunidentified) cofinancier for a project to prepare for future national water security by establishing \na national water resources information system (WRIS) that will enable fact-based integrated \nwater resources management, including a rational policy-based system for water allocation and \ndemand  management. The  Ministry  of  Natural  Resources  and  Environment  (MoNRE)  was \nassigned the responsibility in 2008 for the collection and management of natural resources and \nenvironmental data. A revised Law on Water Resources further strengthened this position. ADB \nwill provide project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) to assist the government to prepare \na project for ADB processing, including independent assessment of policy and technical issues \nand their institutional ramifications. The PPTA is to assist the government define the scope, \ncost,  financing  plan,  implementation  arrangements  including  assigning  responsibility  for \nadvance action. It will assess capacity building needs within MoNRE and custodians of related \ndatabases and define post-project O&M arrangements. Safeguard and financial management \npolicies  of  both  the  ADB  and  the  government  that  should  be  followed  during  project \nimplementation will be defined. The PPTA will guide on actions to maximize the social and \neconomic benefits, including the formulation of water allocation procedures, data sharing and \naccess protocols to improve long-term sustainable management of natural resources and the \nenvironment; the planning of training required to encourage inter-agency data sharing; assured \naccess to summary data and findings by the general public, and the setting of transparent \ncharges for the sale of information generated from the data. The PPTA will advise on the need \nand scope of a phased implementation of the proposed system of data gathering, analysis and \nmanagement, and for the introduction of a basin approach to water management. The PPTA will \ndefine the context for an assessment of the nation\u2019s water governance, as a means to assess \nthe effort required or the likelihood to achieve lasting change for the purpose of water security. \n \nB.
