The Asian Bond Markets Initiative (ABMI) Task Force 3 (TF3) is a regional initiative \nestablished  under  the  Finance  Ministers  and  Central  Bank  Governors  framework  of  the \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the People\u2019s Republic of China, Japan, and \nthe Republic of Korea (collectively ASEAN+3) during its meeting in February 2006. The ABMI \nTF3 requested technical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to review \npolicies, practices, and regulatory standards for bond issuance, and explore the possibility of \nharmonizing these standards and practices to facilitate the Asian bond market development.  \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.   \n \n2.  Following the request by the ABMI TF3, ADB provided regional policy and advisory \ntechnical assistance in 2008  to assess policies and standards of government and corporate \nbond markets and the role of self-regulatory organizations (SROs) in the ASEAN+3 economies.1 \nThe TA project supported activities under the ASEAN+3 Bond Market Forum (ABMF), which \nwas established in September 2010 as a common platform to foster standardization of market \npractices and harmonization of regulations relating to cross-border bond transactions in the \nregion endorsed by the finance ministers. A follow-up TA project was approved to support the \nABMF at the request of the ABMI TF3 during its meeting on 9 March 2011 in Bali, Indonesia.2  \n \n3.  The proposed TA is intended to support the ABMF beyond the current activities, which \nwill be finished by the first quarter of 2014.  The TA aims to contribute to the long-term objective \nof the ABMI, which is greater and more efficient mobilization of regional resources through \ndeeper, broader, and more integrated bond markets.3  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  Much has been achieved since the ABMI was launched in 2003. The volume of local \ncurrency bonds outstanding in emerging East Asia has grown markedly, from less than $1.0 \ntrillion at the end of 2001 to $6.5 trillion by the end of 2012.4 Local currency bond markets \nbecame an effective alternative source of financing for government and corporations during the \nrecent global financial crisis. Regional channeling of regional resources has improved from      \n2.8% in 2001 to 8.4% in 2011, as measured by the relative share of debt portfolio outflow from \nthe region that was reinvested into the region.5 However, many issues remain to be addressed: \nthe bond market size is still small and is dominated by the banking sector; regional resource \nchanneling should be further enhanced; volatile capital flows should be appropriately managed; \nand market efficiency needs to be improved through lower transaction costs, by streamlining \nregulations and market practices. \n \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance for Harmonization of Bond Standards in ASEAN+3. Manila (TA 6514-REG, \n$850,000, approved on 16 December 2008). \n2  ADB. 2012. Technical Assistance for Harmonization of Bond Standards and Market Practices in ASEAN+3: \nSupport for ASEAN+3 Bond Market Forum, Phase 2. Manila (TA 8049-REG, $1,200,000, approved on 13 January \n2012, financed by the Investment Climate Facilitation Fund under the Regional Cooperation and Integration \nFinancing Partnership Facility).  \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 21 November 2013. \n4  Emerging East Asia is composed of the People\u2019s Republic of China; Hong Kong, China; Indonesia; the Republic \nof Korea; Malaysia; the Philippines; Singapore; Thailand; and Viet Nam. Data is from ADB. AsianBondsOnline. \nhttp://asianbondsonline.adb.org/regional/regional.php \n5  International Monetary Fund. Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey.\n  http://www.imf.org/external/np/sta/pi/geo.htm \n ", "2   \n5.  To facilitate a more efficient discussion on streamlining regulations and market practices, \nthe ABMF was established in 2010, where both public and private experts participate.6 The \nABMF was comprised of two forums: Sub-Forum 1 (SF1) and Sub-Forum 2 (SF2). The objective \nof SF1 was to close the information gaps in regulations and market practices, and other areas in \nthe region\u2019s bond markets. SF2 focuses on enhancing regional straight-through processing by \nstandardizing bond transaction procedures and messages.7 \n \n6.  Under the ADB TA on Harmonization of Bond Standards in ASEAN+3 (the first TA), SF1 \nworked on collecting legal and regulatory information on each ASEAN+3 market, to eliminate \ninformation gaps in the markets. SF2 worked on identifying detailed bond transaction flows with \na view to standardizing the flows and enhancing straight-through processing in the region. As a \nkey output of the ABMF, a comprehensive ASEAN+3 Bond Market Guide was published in April \n2012 containing comparative analysis on the bond markets across ASEAN+3 economies, with \nindividual market guides for 11 economies.8 \n \n7.  The information and findings gathered under the first TA became the foundation of the \nnext ABMF activity. More specifically for SF1, the finding that the concepts of professional \ninvestor, professional market, and exempted regime already exist in most economies became \nthe basis for the view that the region could pursue standardization of such concepts across \neconomies. For SF2, it was found that many economies have significantly developed a bond \ntrade  and  settlement  infrastructure,  although  they  are  still  fragmented  and  require  further \nupgrades. The study was limited, however, to government bond delivery-versus-payment (DVP) \nflows and ABMF members, hence it would be beneficial to further study the other types of bond \ntransaction flows to provide policy recommendations for standardization of the flows. \n \n8.  Against this background, the ABMF started the next phase supported by the TA project \nHarmonization of Bond Standards and Market Practices in ASEAN+3: Support for ASEAN+3 \nBond  Market  Forum,  Phase  2  (the  second  TA).  Since  2013,  SF1  has  been  working  on \ndeveloping a regionally standardized bond issuance framework called the ASEAN+3 Multi-\ncurrency Bond Issuance Framework (AMBIF) and SF2 has been working on identifying bond \ntransaction flows, including corporate bond DVP flows, and on interest payment and redemption \nprocedures to provide policy recommendations for standardization. With continued discussion \nthrough regular ABMF meetings, information gathered from market visits, and studies provided \nby the ADB secretariat team,  the AMBF members finalized the interim reports for both SF1 and \nSF2 during the 12th ABMF meeting on 23\u201324 April 2013 in Jakarta, Indonesia, describing key \npolicy recommendations for AMBIF and standardizing bond transaction flows.9 The reports were \nsubmitted to the ASEAN+3 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors\u2019 Meeting on 2 May \n2013 through the ABMI TF3. The activities supported by the second TA will be completed by 31 \nMarch 2014, with submission of full reports to the ABMI TF3. \n \n                                                \n6  Members of the ABMF, appointed or endorsed by the ABMI TF3, include regulatory bodies, stock exchanges, \nSROs, associations of market participants in region, and international market players. Key activities and outputs of \nthe ABMF are reported to and guided by the ABMI TF3. ADB is participating in the ABMF as the secretariat. \n7  Straight-through processing is generally recognized as a mechanism that enables trading and transactions to be \nconducted electronically without manual handling or intervention. \n8  The guide has been positively evaluated and mostly referred by the market participants as the first official guide \nendorsed by policy authorities, and has contributed to enhancing investors\u2019 understanding of the markets. \n9  In the first TA, six ABMF meetings were organized quarterly during October 2010\u2013December 2011. In the second \nTA, seven ABMF meetings were organized during February 2012\u2013July 2013. On the sidelines of regular ABMF \nmeetings, SROs have held their own gathering to discuss AMBIF-related and other issues since April 2012. \nCentral banks and securities depositories organized the first Cross-border Settlement Infrastructure Forum in July \n2013. \n ", "  3 \n9.  Through the activities supported by the second TA, key policy recommendations on \nAMBIF  and  bond  transaction  flows  were  identified,  while  actual  policy  actions  for  the \nrecommendation will take time. ABMF members acknowledged the need for continued support \nfor the implementation of AMBIF in the case of SF1, and additional study to help standardize \nbond transaction flows and support AMBIF bond issuance and transactions in the case of SF2.  \n \n10.  In order to continue the progress made by the ABMF and its activities, the co-chairs of \nthe ABMI TF3 requested ADB to continue to support the ABMF. The focus of the proposed TA \nincludes (i) continued study on AMBIF components and providing support for regulators to adopt \nand  implement  AMBIF  by  2014;  (ii)  developing  reference  DVP  model  flows  and  policy \nrecommendations  for  standardizing  message  items,  market  practices,  and  cross-border \ncollateral management; and (iii) updating the guide published in April 2012.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The impact of the TA will be increased intraregional bond issuance and transaction, \nwhich will contribute to greater and more efficient mobilization of regional resources. With the \nintroduction of AMBIF and policy efforts to standardize transaction flows, intraregional bond \ninvestments are expected to grow further to 10% by 2015 from 8.4% in 2011. The outcome of \nthe TA would be increase in issuance of AMBIF standardized bond. After introduction of AMBIF, \nit is expected that some bonds would be issued and transacted under the framework, supported \nby policymakers with better knowledge of the market.10 \n \n                                                \n10 The TA is consistent with ADB\u2019s Regional Cooperation and Integration Strategy adopted in 2006 identifying \nharmonization of regulatory standards and removal of regulatory hurdles that hamper the development of financial \ninstruments as key focus. It is also consistent with the Financial Sector Operational Plan, which identifies regional \nfinancial cooperation as one of key focus areas of financial sector development together with capital market \ndevelopment. \n ", "4   \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.  The output components of the TA are as follows:  \n \n(i)  Study and recommendations for adoption and implementation of AMBIF (SF1) by \nthe participating regulators in 2014. The study  will include provision of additional \ninformation requested by and in consultation with the regulators.11 \n(ii)  Clear and time-bound action plans for standardization of bond transaction flows \nand  cross-border  collateral  recommended  (SF2).  This  includes  developing  a \nreference DVP model and message formats and message items. A study on cross-\nborder  collateral  and  repo  services  will  be  conducted,  including  on  the  legal  and \nregulatory framework, market practices and infrastructure, services currently available in \nthe market, and possible future services through linkage of the infrastructure.12  \n(iii)  Updated  ASEAN+3  Bond  Market  Guide  produced.  The  guide  will  contribute  to \nattracting more investments by enhancing investors\u2019 understanding.  It will incorporate \nthe information gathered through various sources since its initial publication, including \nnew individual market guides for Cambodia and Myanmar.   \n \n13.  Progress made by the TA project will be shared with ABMI and ABMF members. Study \nvisits will be conducted to collect necessary information on AMBIF components, message flows \nand formats, and cross-border collateral and repo management.13 \n \n14.  Successful implementation of the TA activities, especially AMBIF and standardization of \nbond  transaction  flows,  requires  strong  support  from  policy  authorities  and  regulators. \nCooperation  with  SROs  and  market  practitioners  will  be  needed  in  streamlining  market \npractices.14 Risks  to  the  project  include  unexpected  financial  shocks  that  could  negatively \ninfluence financial liberalization and harmonization, and lack of commitment by policy authorities \nin standardizing regulations and market practices. Timely recruitment of qualified consultants \nand experts for cross-border collateral would be important for successfully conducting required \nstudies and developing policy recommendations. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,228,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nInvestment Climate Facilitation Fund under the Regional Cooperation and Integration Financing \nPartnership Facility and administered by ADB.15 The cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 2. \n \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n                                                \n11  The support for regulators will include exploring pilot issuance under AMBIF. The issuer could include well-known \nor multinational corporations of ASEAN+3 and international financial institutions. The investors will be limited to \nprofessional investors, the specific scope of which will be identified by regulators.   \n12  The study on collateral and repo services will review existing research, including that conducted by ADB for \nASEAN economies, in close cooperation with ADB\u2019s Southeast Asia Department.   \n13  Knowledge support for Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, and Viet \nNam  (collectively  BCLMV)  to  develop  local  currency  bond  markets  focusing  on  government  bonds  and \nfoundations for market development may also be considered on the sideline of the study visits.  \n14  The cooperation will include consultation with key market participants, market associations, and SROs on \nensuring market demand and distribution of bond issuance under AMBIF.   \n15  The Investment Climate Facilitation Fund was established by the Government of Japan. \n ", "  5 \n16.  ADB will be the executing agency. The Office of Regional Economic Integration will \nimplement the TA, in consultation with ABMF members and the ABMI TF3 co-chairs, and will \nsupervise the work of the consultants. The TA is expected to be completed in 18 months, during \nApril 2014\u2013September 2015. During TA paper preparation, appropriate partners as centers of \nexcellence will be explored.16 \n \n17.  The TA will require 30 person-months of individual international consultant services and \n36 person-months of individual national consultant services, comprising: (i) 9 person-months for \nthe financial legal expert, with extensive knowledge of financial laws, regulations, and market \npractices in Asian financial markets as well as those of Europe and the United States; (ii) 6 \nperson-months for the financial information technology specialist, with extensive knowledge of \ninformation systems, particularly of clearing and settlement in the region; (iii) 6 person-months \nfor the collateral management specialist, with knowledge and experience of domestic and cross-\nborder collateral management with respect to laws, regulations, and operational procedures; (iv) \n9 person-months for the custody business specialist, with experience and knowledge of the \ncustody  industry  and  profound  operational  knowledge  of  settlement  practices  in  financial \nmarkets, particularly in Asia; (v) 18 person-months for a national consultant with experience in \nproject coordination; and (vi) 18 person-months for a national consultant with knowledge of \nwebsite database management. About 12 resource persons will be invited to participate in \nseminars  and  workshops  of  the  Office  of  Regional  Economic  Integration  as  speakers, \ndiscussants, or facilitators, for a total of 1 person-month. In the event that ADB staff act as \nresource persons for the purpose of effectiveness, travel costs are to be charged to the TA but \ntheir salaries and benefits will be absorbed by internal administrative expenses.17 Recruitment \nof consultants will be undertaken on an individual basis in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The outline terms of reference for \nthe consultants are in Appendix 3. Disbursement under the TA will be made in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time).  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,228,000 to be financed on \na grant basis by the Investment Climate Facilitation Fund under the Regional Cooperation and \nIntegration  Financing  Partnership  Facility  for  Support  for  ASEAN+3  Bond  Market  Forum: \nRegional Standardization of Bond Issuance Framework and Transaction Flows, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n16  Consultation with Asia Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (ASIFMA) and the Society for \nWorldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication is under way to designate either of them as a center of \nexcellence. \n17  A memo jointly issued by the Budget, Personnel, and Management Systems Department and the Strategy and \nPolicy Department was circulated (dated 26 June 2013) to provide guidance on charging costs to TA and internal \nadministrative expense budgets. In the memo, para. 3 item (ix) states that \u201cfor preparatory works, implementation \nand administrative support, ADB staff are not eligible to charge corresponding salaries and benefits to the TA.  \nHowever, if RETA/TA paper clearly specifies and includes provision in its cost estimates to provide support \nservices such as travel and administrative expenses, then such costs should be charged to the RETA/TA.\u201d \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks  \nImpact      Assumption \nIncreased  Relative share of debt  Bond market data of the  Support from ASEAN+3 \nintraregional bond  portfolio outflow invested  ASEAN+3 economies  countries \nissuance and  into the region increases to     \ntransactions  10% by 2015  ABMI TF3 monitoring of  Risks \n(2011 baseline: 8.4%)  the progress of the  Unexpected financial \nABMF, and promotion of  shock may delay \nharmonization of  financial liberalization \nregulatory framework  and cooperation  \n \nEnd of quantitative \neasing \n \n \nOutcome      Assumption \nIssuance of AMBIF  At least two bond issuance  Consultation with  Timely adoption of  \nstandardized bonds  and transactions through  regulators  AMBIF and \nare increased   AMBIF by 2015    recommendation on \n(2013 baseline: 0)  Report on consultation  standardizing bond \nwith ABMI TF3 co- transaction flows \nchairs, including   \nreporting to ABMI TF3  Risk \nby the ABMF chairs at  Lack of market appetite \nthe official meetings at  for AMBIF and \nleast twice a year  standardization \nOutputs      Assumption \n1.
