Following a request from the Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic \n(Lao PDR) for preparatory technical assistance (TA)1 for the Northern and Central Region Water \nSupply and Urban Development (NCWUD) Project, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) sent \nthe  Fact-Finding  Mission  to  the  Lao  PDR  from  20\u201328  April  2004,  to  design  the  urban \ndevelopment component of the Project. The Mission held discussions with key officials from the \nMinistry of Communication, Transport, Post and Construction (MCTPC); Ministry of Finance \n(MOF); Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA); Committee for Planning and Cooperation (CPC); \nDepartment of Public Administration and Civil Service (DPACS); and other agencies concerned. \nBased  on  discussions  and  field  visits,  the  Mission  reached  an  understanding  with  the \nGovernment  regarding  the  objectives,  scope,  cost  and  financing,  and  implementation \narrangements of the TA, and on the terms of reference for consulting services. The preliminary \nproject framework is in Appendix 1. \n   \nII.   ISSUES \n \n2.  Although rapid development progress has occurred during the past decade, the  Lao \nPDR ranks 143rd out of 173 countries in terms of poverty,2 with an annual gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) per capita of $324. The urban population of the Lao PDR is approximately 18% \nof the total population, with agriculture as the largest  contributor to GDP. With an average \nannual growth rate of 4.7% between 1990 and 2003, urban areas are playing an increasingly \nimportant role in economic development, serving as centers for economic growth, markets for \nagricultural  exchange,  locations  for ni dustries and nodes of transportation, and centers for \nattracting foreign and domestic investment. However, as in other large Asian urban areas, rapid \nurbanization and lack of adequate water supply, environmental sanitation, treatment systems, \nand other public services have contributed to poverty, poor health, and low productivity of the \nmajority of the urban population. If nothing is done, the bleak prospects of large urban slums \nand social ills that plague large cities will unfold in the Lao PDR. \n \n3.  ADB  has  actively  assisted  the  Lao  urban  sector  since  1991,  with  emphasis  on \nenvironmental and infrastructure improvements, urban governance, and capacity building. The \nassistance has included the Water Supply and Sanitation Project3 and three related water \nsupply and sanitation projects: Vientiane Integrated Urban Development Project,4 Vientiane \nUrban Infrastructure and Services Project,5 and Secondary Towns Urban Development Project6 \n(covering Luang Prabang, Pakse, Savannakhet, and Thakek). The ADB commitments total \n$140.10 million in loans and $10.23 million in TAs between 1991\u20132003.7 The ongoing Small \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 27 February 2004 under the title \u201cUrban \nDevelopment\u201d. \n2  United Nations. 2002.

Currently ADB is focusing on the development of smaller towns in the urban hierarchy, particularly \nthose in the northern and central regions. ", "2  \nTowns Sector Development Project will serve to enhance rural-market linkages that connect \nrural  areas  with  subregional  and  international  markets  and  contribute  to  sustainable \nenvironmental management in urban and peri-urban areas. \n \n4.  The need to effectively manage the increasing demand for urban infrastructure and \nservices and the need for continued policy dialogue between ADB and the Lao Government has \nled  to  several  outcomes.  For  example,  the  creation  of  urban  development  administration \nauthorities (UDAAs) in Vientiane and four provincial towns to plan, implement, finance, and \nmanage urban development through three decrees has enabled collection of urban-based \nrevenues. The Local Administration Law, adopted by the National Assembly in October 2003, \nspecified the various government levels, roles, and responsibilities. In the water supply sector, \nprovincial nam papas (PNPs) have been created to implement and manage water supply \nsystems, while the Water Supply Authority (WASA) was tasked to regulate the water supply \nsector through a decree and the 1999 Law on Water Resources. Since then, various regulatory \nand institutional frameworks for more effective service provision have been developed. To yield \nmaximum benefits and necessary impacts, however, these laws and decrees must be fully \nimplemented. \n \n5.  Despite assistance by ADB and other development partners to the Lao Government, a \ncoherent urban sector strategy and  investment plan is currently lacking, and is needed to \nprovide an overall framework for urban sector investments. Furthermore, despite the large \ndemand for urban infrastructure and services, the economic and social potentials have not been \nexplored. For example, tourism in Champassak, Khammouane, Luang Namtha, and Luang \nPrabang  provinces  requires  the  development  of  tourist  hubs  and  infrastructure;  the \nSavannakhet Special Economic Zone in the east-west economic corridor requires industrial \ninfrastructure; plans for Nam Theun II hydropower plant will have spatial and development \nimplications for Thakek; increased activity in border towns of Houaxai, Pakxane, Savannakhet, \nand Thakek, will have further social and economic implications that need to be addressed. \nSmaller  towns  in  the  urban  hierarchy  are  also  playing  larger  roles  in  the  marketing  and \nexchange of agricultural products and as centers of distribution of goods and services within \ntheir regions. In anticipation of the opportunities and challenges that may arise, the Government \nmust  embark  on  a  long-term  strategic  plan  for  urban  development,  along  with  a  sector \ninvestment plan, which incorporates recent urban-related works by the Government, ADB, and \nother agencies and the preparation of a project design to develop basic urban services for \nselected small towns in the northern and central regions of the Lao PDR.  \n \n6.  From implementation experience, some important issues and lessons have surfaced. \nFirst is the imperative to assess needs for countrywide investments and priorities in the urban \nsector to enable decisions with significant impacts. Second, resource and capacity constraints \nand mobilization for capital investments and operation and maintenance need to be addressed \nthrough policy, legal, and institutional means. The effectiveness of PNPs, UDAAs, WASA, and \nother  stakeholders  involved  has  been  constrained  by  the  policy  environment  and  limited \ncapacity to provide adequate and sustainable urban services in Lao towns. Third are issues of \ninteragency cooperation as a result of administrative reforms and changes in the institutional \nstructure.  Fourth  is  the  importance  of  establishing  a  management  framework  that  will \nsystematically evaluate and monitor environmental, involuntary resettlement, and other social \nimpacts to fully comply with safeguard policies. A summary initial poverty and social analysis is \nin Appendix 2. \n \n \n \n ", "  3\n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n7.  The TA aims to assist the Lao Government to reduce poverty and improve the quality of \nlife of its urban population through public services and investments. The objectives are to (i) \nguide the future urban investments and development of public services; (ii) improve the capacity \nof local governments to provide and sustain quality services and enable broad-based support \nparticipation from civil society; and (iii) prepare a preliminary design to provide basic urban \nservices to include water supply and sanitation, solid waste management, roads, and markets \nfor selected project towns in the northern and central regions of the Lao PDR.  \n \n8.  The TA will be a part of a series of activities leading to the forthcoming NCWUD loan \nproject: (i) phase I of the Northern and Central Region Water Supply and Sanitation TA,8 (ii) TA \nfor the urban development component of the Northern and Central Region Water Supply and \nUrban Development (the TA), and (iii) phase II of the Northern and Central Region Water \nSupply TA. Phase I, completed in October 2003, produced survey results of shortlisted towns. \nThe TA will focus on the urban development strategy and urban component of the NCWUD loan \nproject. Phase II will combine outcomes from phase I and the TA, and proceed with a detailed \nproject design for the ensuing NCWUD loan, which is expected to be implemented in 2005.  \n \n9.  The first main project output will be an urban sector strategy for 2005\u20132020, which will \nprovide assistance for long-term planning in the Lao urban sector for 2005\u20132020. It will include \n(i)  an  assessment  of  current  sector  conditions,  issues,  potentials,  and  constraints  and \nrecommendations on policy, institutional, and organizational changes for effective provision of \npublic  services,  (ii)  an  assessment  of  monitoring  indicators;  and  (iii)  preparation  of  a \nprocurement plan for the proposed project. Reference will be made to the Government\u2019s 2004 \nNational Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy; the Water Supply and Sanitation Sector \nStrategy and Water Sector Investment Plan; and ADB\u2019s Greater Mekong Subregion program, \nNorthern Region Development Strategy, and other sectoral programs and policies. The second \noutput will be an urban sector investment plan, which will provide indicative targets, prioritization \nof activities, amount of investments, and sequencing of activities required for various aspects of \nurban development. The third output will comprise selection of project towns for the proposed \nNCWUD Project and design of key activities and urban improvements based on assessment of \nneeds, available resources, and commitments from Government and communities. The fourth \noutput will comprise reports on the key issues and constraints facing the urban sector and \nrecommendations for future action.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The TA will be implemented in two phases. The first phase will entail an overall review of \nthe Lao urban sector and assessment of existing service delivery, identification of key issues \nand challenges, and recommendations, to be encapsulated in an urban sector strategy and \nurban sector investment plan. The second phase will consist of a project design for the urban \ndevelopment component of the NCWUD Project in selected project towns. The methodological \napproach and key activities of the TA will include the following: \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2002.

This \nwill be obtained from Government, ADB, and other publications and reports. Will \ninclude, but not be limited to, identification of key issues and challenges facing \nthe sector, and assessment of policy, institutional, and human and financial \nresource conditions and constraints.  \n \n(ii)  Data collection from surveys, interviews, and focus group discussions. \nThis will assess potentials and service needs of towns in the urban hierarchy: \nVientiane (capital city), secondary towns, provincial towns and small towns, and \nborder towns; economic corridors; and rural-urban  and  subregional  linkages. \nRespondents will be key personnel from local governments, community leaders, \nand potential beneficiaries. \n \n(iii)  Policy and institutional analysis. This will include thorough assessments of (a) \nstakeholders, and the policy, legal, institutional, and organizational environments \nwithin which public services are formulated and delivered; and (b) human and \nfinancial resource constraints for effective delivery. In particular the analysis will \naddress intra- and inter-organizational aspects of PNPs, UDAAs, and WASA to \ninclude,  but  not  be  limited  to,  development  of  UDAAs  to  function  as \nmunicipalities, further development of WASA as a regulatory agency for the \nwater supply sector, and strengthening of the institutional capacity of various \nagencies.  \n \n(iv)  Recommendations  and  indicators.  Recommendations  for  strategic  action, \ninstitutional  arrangements,  amount  and  phasing  of  urban  investments,  and \noverall framework for urban development will be presented. Monitoring indicators \nto determine performance will be developed. \n \n(v)  Design. The design of basic urban infrastructure will include, but not be limited \nto,  water  supply,  drainage,  flood  protection,  roads  and  bridges,  solid  waste \nmanagement, and market places. Selection of project towns will be based on \npoverty level, urgency, need, and willingness to participate. The design of the \nurban development component of the NCWUD Project will be identified in the TA.  \n \n11.  A series of workshops will be funded under the TA. The first workshop, to be attended by \npolicymakers and resource persons from, among others, CPC, DPACS, MCTPC, MFA, MOF, \nand other key government ministries and agencies, will provide guidance and ideas on what \nconstitutes an \u201curban sector strategy.\u201d A second workshop will discuss findings from the survey; \na third workshop will discuss the findings of the consultants\u2019 draft final report. Other, smaller \nworkshops will be conducted with local decisionmakers to discuss and develop commitment on \nurban development and management. Workshops will produce and disseminate proceedings in \nthe English and Lao languages.  \n \n12.  The TA will fund activities that promote exchange of information within the Mekong \nregion, such as comparative studies for policymakers and key personnel to be specified and \nagreed upon between the Government and ADB. Facilitation will be provided to participants to \nprepare the trips and accompany and debrief participants during and after the trips. Training on \nurban  development-related  skills  within  countries  in  the  region  will  also  be  conducted. \nParticipants will submit reports to project implementation unit for inclusion in the progress report. \n  \n ", "  5\nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $236,000  equivalent,  of  which  $200,000 \nequivalent will be provided by ADB, covering the entire foreign exchange component of $89,000 \nand the local currency cost of $111,000. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA \nfunding program and will cover costs of consulting services, surveys, reports and publications, \nworkshops and training, and administration and support costs. The Lao Government will provide \n$36,000 equivalent, in kind, to cover labor, office space and materials, counterpart staff, and \nother  costs.  A  detailed  cost  estimate  and  financing  plan  is  provided  in  Appendix  3.  The \nGovernment has been informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any \nensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  A steering committee chaired by MCTPC with members consisting of CPC, DPACS, \nMFA, and MOF will convene every 2 months to monitor TA progress. The Executing Agency is \nthe  Department  for  Housing  and  Urban  Planning  of  MCTPC,  which  established  a  project \nmanagement unit (PMU) on 15 May 2004. The PMU is responsible for day-to-day coordination \nand  monitoring  of  project  activities,  and  will  provide  guidance  to  consultants;  facilitate \nstakeholder workshops, training, and comparative studies; and supervise surveys. The PMU \nconsists of a full-time project manager, an engineer, a social specialist, and an accountant, with \nclose cooperation from the WASA project management.  \n \n15.  The  TA  assignment  will  be  undertaken  by  a  team  of  international  and  domestic \nconsultants, to be recruited on an individual basis under the  ADB Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. \nTwo  international  consultants\u2014an  urban  planner  and  team  leader  and  an  institutional \ndevelopment  specialist\u2014will  be  recruited  for  a  total  of  5  person-months.  Three  domestic \nconsultants\u2014two civil engineers and a social sector specialist\u2014will be recruited for a total of 10 \nperson-months. An additional three international consultants\u2014a municipal engineer (2 person-\nmonths), an environment specialist (1 person-month) and a social development specialist (1 \nperson-month)\u2014will be recruited separately under another TA (footnote 8). Outline terms of \nreference for consultants are given in Appendix 4. \n \n16.  The TA will be implemented over a 7-month period, from 1 August 2004 to 1 April 2005. \nAn inception report, which will propose the methodology for carrying out activities for the full TA \nduration is expected to be submitted to ADB within 2 weeks of consultant recruitment. An \ninterim report, which will incorporate survey findings, will be submitted within 2 months of TA \nimplementation. A draft final report, which presents the urban sector strategy, investment plan, \nand project design, will be submitted within 5 months of TA implementation. The final report will \nincorporate comments from the Government and ADB, and will be submitted at the end of TA \nimplementation.  Tripartite  meetings  will  be  held  among  the  Government,  ADB,  and  the \nconsultant team during inception and completion of the TA. ADB approval for this TA does not \ncommit ADB to financing an ensuing project. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n17.   The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $200,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for preparing the Northern and \nCentral Region Water Supply and Urban Development Project, and hereby reports this action to \nthe Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nPRELIMINARY PROJECT FRAMEWORK \n \n \nProject Monitoring \nDesign Summary  Performance Targets  Risks/Assumptions \nMechanisms \n \nGoal       \n       \nTo improve the quality of life  \u2022  Improved urban  \u2022  National indicators \nand reduce poverty in urban  environment, public  and statistics \nareas   health, and well-being   \n    \u2022  Government and \n\u2022  Decreased poverty  external funding \nincidence  agencies reports \n   \n\u2022  Equitable access to \nurban services \n \nObjectives       \n       \n\u2022 To develop and sustain  \u2022  Continued  \u2022  Inventory of urban  \u2022  Support from \naccessible and affordable  improvements of urban  assets  government \nurban infrastructure and  and environmental    agencies and \nservices, particularly for the  infrastructure and  \u2022  Government reports  provincial or local \npoor   services     governments \n    \u2022  Funding agency or \n\u2022 To facilitate broad-based  \u2022  Adequate resources for  nongovernment  \u2022  An environment \nparticipation and support  operation and  organization (NGO)  conducive for civic \nfrom civil society to operate  maintenance (O&M)  reports; interviews  participation \nand maintain urban    with communities/ \ninfrastructure investments  \u2022  Mechanisms to enable  community leaders  \u2022  Continued support \ndecision-making at \n    for administrative \n\u2022 To improve the managerial,  local and community  \u2022  Government reports,  reforms by \nlevels and propensity \ntechnical, and financial  funding agency or  government and civil \nfor communities to \ncapacity of local  NGO reports  society \nmobilize resources \ngovernments to provide \n \nand sustain quality services   \u2022  Ability to generate \nresources for capital \ninvestments and O&M, \nbetter equipped and \nresponsive personnel \nfor urban service \ndelivery \n \nOutputs       \n       \n\u2022 Improved urban  \u2022  Improved road access  \u2022  Inventory of urban  \u2022 Proper selection of \nenvironment, infrastructure,  and road conditions  assets  project sites and \nand services      targeted \n  \u2022  Improved  \u2022  Funding agency,  beneficiaries \n\u2022 Improved local capacity to  environmental  NGO, government \n \nmobilize resources and  sanitation: drainage,  reports  \u2022 Sufficient and \nplan, build, and maintain  solid waste, flood    sustained political, \nurban infrastructure  protection  \u2022  Funding agency or  institutional, and \n    NGO reports;  community support \n\u2022 Increased civic awareness  \u2022  Improved water supply  interviews with  for urban reforms \nand participation  systems  communities or \n \n  community leaders   \n\u2022  Ability of local   \ngovernment and \ncommunities to deliver \nand maintain essential \nurban infrastructure \n \nContinued on next page.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Lao PDR: \n \nWith a gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of $324, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) is one of \nthe poorest countries in world. The urban population is currently 18% of the total population of 5 million and is growing \nat 4.7% per annum. However, urban development in the Lao PDR has long suffered from insufficient funds and weak \ninstitutional capacity. Furthermore, urban infrastructure and services are in poor condition, inadequate to meet the \ngrowing demand, and pose severe environmental  and  health  problems,  which  inhibits  social  and  economic \ndevelopment. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) country and strategy program (CSP) for Lao indicates that \nassistance will be directed to the poor in the northern region with emphasis on economic integration with neighboring \neconomies, market-based  development  initiatives,  human  resource  development,  and  sustainable  social  and \nenvironmental management. The development of urban-rural market linkages and connecting rural Lao PDR to \nsubregional and international markets\u2014which implies the need for investing in urban areas\u2014is one of the thrusts of \nthe CSP. \n \nThe project will develop a long-term urban sector strategy and an investment plan, and will improve the urban \nservices in selected towns in the north and central region that suffer from inadequate and poor services. The \nproject will address the severe environmental and health problems facing the town residents by providing much \nneeded solid waste, urban roads and drainage, as well as water supply and sanitation systems. With improved \nurban services, the project will strengthen urban areas as regional centers for growth and stimulate the economic \ndevelopment in the region. A demand-driven community awareness and pro-poor community development \nprogram will be designed to expand the services to poor and address their needs.  \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Proposed Poverty Classification: Poverty Intervention \n   \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?    \n   \nApproximately 38% of the Lao PDR population live below the poverty line.  Category B \nThe northern region is one of the poorest in the Lao PDR with poverty \nincidence of 43.3% compared to Vientiane (16.7%) and the central and \nsouthern regions (27.7% and 35.9%, respectively). In terms of rural-urban \ndisparities, although poverty incidence is higher in rural areas (41%) than \nin urban areas (27%), the rate of poverty reduction in urban areas is \nslower because of higher income inequalities in urban areas. The project \nintends to focus on small towns in the northern region with severe \nenvironmental and health problems, with the general population having \nlower living standards and higher poverty levels. The poor are the most \nvulnerable  group  due  to  inadequate  environmental  and  sanitary \nconditions.
