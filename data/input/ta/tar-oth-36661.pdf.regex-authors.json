The Pacific Department proposes technical assistance (TA) funding support on a grant \nbasis from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for a regional TA to conduct an analysis of \nregional and national operations in aviation, shipping, and road transport services.1   \n2.  This TA aims to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of transportation services by \ndeveloping consensus on regional and national sector road maps for reform of public sector \noperations and policies and increased private sector participation in service provision, leading to \nincreased economic development in the Pacific region. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n3.  Improving transportation services to support private sector growth and rural development \nhas been an enduring feature of ADB\u2019s dialogue with Pacific developing member countries \n(PDMCs) and is an objective in 11 of the 13 country strategies and programs. Numerous field \nmissions and previous regional TAs (Appendix 2) undertaken in PDMCs have established the \nrequired basis for this proposal.2  This TA is included in ADB\u2019s Pacific Regional Cooperation \nStrategy and Program 2003-2008.   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  The 13 PDMCs are widely dispersed over a large geographic area and differ widely in \nsize,  population,  endowments,  opportunities,  and  development  constraints.  A  total  regional \npopulation of about 8 million inhabit a landmass of about 500,000 square kilometers (km2) \nseparated by vast distances across an ocean area of about 30 million km2.  No two PDMCs \nshare a common land boundary.  The region is therefore dependent on air and sea transport for \npassengers and freight to a much greater extent than most ADB member countries.  \n \n5.  Much of the Pacific region\u2019s economic growth potential relies on improved connectivity \nthrough efficient and effective transport services.  Tourism and high-value exports (such as tuna \nfor the sashimi market) depend on improved aviation.  Export of commodities and high reliance \non imports translate into extensive dependence on international shipping.  Access of rural \npopulations to international and domestic markets for their produce is determined through road \ntransport  and  interisland  shipping  services.    Yet  improvements  to  transport  networks  and \nservices in the Pacific region face many unique challenges.   \n \n6.  Travel between PDMCs is constrained by high airfares and cargo tariffs for sparse \nservices, while underdeveloped road networks and unreliable interisland shipping hamper travel \nwithin each country.  It is common for capital cities to be linked by only one or two flights per \nweek, with airfares between PDMC capitals that are often twice as high as those to metropolitan \ncountries on a per-mile basis.  Outer islands have few, if any, roads and are commonly called \non by cargo ships once or twice a month, with frequent service suspensions.   \n \n7.   High transport costs and poor schedules adversely affect prices and terms of trade in \nPDMCs, as these small, vulnerable, and generally resource-poor island economies rely on \nimports and face difficult access to domestic and international markets for their exports.  Rural \nproducers cannot reliably supply their markets under typical conditions, and when they do, the \nprices they face for both inputs and outputs are adversely affected.  Difficult transportation is \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 20  November 2003. \n2  There has been no additional fact-finding mission specifically for this RETA. ", "2 \nalso in part responsible for poor economic integration and low levels of intra-Pacific trade that \nare less than 5% of the total trade of the region.   \n \n8.  As a result of these challenges, rural-urban linkages, domestic trade, and export of \nprimary commodities cannot contribute fully to national economic growth.  Yet improvements to \nthe transportation system would support growth in private investments, employment generation, \ncommerce and trade, local business development, export of goods and services, reduction in \nconsumer prices, and consequently, poverty reduction. \n \n9.  The  current  government-dominated  environment  for  service  provision  shapes  the \npotential for improvements.  Public management of transport policies and assets significantly \naffects the provision and efficiency of both public and private transport services, as public sector \noperations, institutions, regulations, and incentives established under the policy frameworks \ndetermine transport markets, and either support or constrain competitiveness. \n \n10.  Aviation  and  shipping  services  in  the  Pacific  are  dominated  by  publicly  owned \nenterprises, which are often monopoly operators.  This is in part due to the nature of very small \nmarkets, which make it difficult for multiple providers to gain entry and achieve the necessary \nscale to become commercially viable.  In some cases, monopoly operators may represent the \noptimal structure, where traffic and cargo volumes are too small to sustain multiple providers.  In \nother  cases,  the  private  sector  may  be  able  to  operate  more  efficiently,  either  in  direct \ncompetition or in a serially contestable market with public sector operators.   \n \n11.  Private  sector  participation  in  transport  services  can  be  enhanced  through \ndocumentation of direct (e.g., fares and tariffs) and indirect (e.g., delays and maintenance) \nlogistics  costs,  analysis  of  market  structures  and  opportunities,  identification  of  constraints \nincluding  sector  regulations  and  management  practices  of  state-owned  operators,  and \nrecommended  improvements  to  the  enabling  environment  for  investments  and  service \noperations.  Even in small markets where competition between multiple providers is not easily \ncommercially  viable,  market  contestability  can  be  introduced  through  regular  tenders  for \nmanagement contracts or lowest-cost route-specific subsidies.   \n \n12.  The  transport  sector  strategy  of  ADB\u2019s  Pacific  Regional  Cooperation  Strategy  and \nProgram 2004-2006 includes a review and assessment of the constraints to efficient operations \nin  the  region  as  one  of  its  four  focus  areas.    It  also  recognizes  that  inefficiencies  and \ndeficiencies in policy and regulatory frameworks, public management of infrastructure assets, \nand other public procedures provide inadequate incentives for private sector participation. \n \n13.  ADB  has  a  long-established  interest  in  fostering  sector  improvements  and  Pacific \nregional  cooperation,  focused  primarily  on  infrastructure  investments  and  institutional \nstrengthening  for  public  sector  planning  and  management,  with  some  attention  given  to \nimproving several existing national operators.   \n \n14.   In the aviation sector, much of this assistance has focused on expanding and improving \nexisting airport facilities.  ADB has addressed aviation sector needs with eight TA projects ($2.6 \nmillion)  for  feasibility  studies  for  upgrading  domestic  airports,  institution  building  including \nimprovement of the financial management systems of international airports, reform and training \nto improve airport safety, air traffic control, and financial feasibility for cooperative safety and \nsecurity oversight.  ADB assistance to the shipping sector has been delivered through 19 TAs \nthat focused on infrastructure for ports and shipyards, including one institutional assessment \nand four national shipping services assessments.  ADB assistance to the road transport sector ", "    3 \nhas been delivered through 12 TAs that focused mainly on road infrastructure, including one \nsafety and traffic management assessment.  The specific TA projects are listed in Appendix 1.   \n \n15.   The only TA to specifically address regional aviation service provision (TA 5682-REG) \nnoted  significant  market  failures  and  called  for  long-term  support  from  ADB.    No  TA  has \nexamined  the  performance  of  the  overall  regional  transport  system  in  providing  transport \nservices across land, sea, and air, and very few have analyzed methods to enhance private \nsector provision of such services.  However, it is significant that ADB\u2019s recent regional private \nsector assessment for the Pacific region3 calls for enhanced participation and competition in \nproviding transport service.   \n \n16.  There are no recent or ongoing assessments or projects by other aid agencies at the \nregional level in the Pacific similar to this proposal.  The most recent World Bank analysis, the \nPacific Islands Transport Sector Study in 1993, focused on existing (mostly public) air and sea \ncarriers and did not examine opportunities for greater private sector participation.  The ongoing \nADB study Assessing the Impact of Transport and Energy Infrastructure on Poverty Reduction \n(TA 5947) cofinanced by the World Bank and Japan Bank for International Cooperation, makes \nno distinction between public and private sector provision of transportation services and uses \nfour Asian countries for its case studies.  The European Union funded a two-phase Pacific \nRegional Civil Aviation Communications Project between 1993 and 2003 that provided airport \nequipment but did not analyze service provision.  However, a forthcoming study proposed by \nthe Australian Agency for International Development for 2004 will examine opportunities for \nimproved cooperation and pooling of existing resources for regional and subregional air and sea \nservices.  Though it is not expected to produce a definitive program portfolio, it may catalyze a \nconstituency for reform.   \n \n17.  This TA will add to existing knowledge and complement work undertaken by ADB and \nothers by analyzing the transport system as an integrated whole, extending the analysis to \nreform of public sector agencies and operators, and improving the climate for private sector \nparticipation.  It will also complement an upcoming project work by laying a foundation for \nservice provision to make optimal use of the infrastructure as it is developed.4 \n \n18.  By developing sector road maps with solid stakeholder acceptance, the TA will create an \nenabling environment for future domestic and international direct investment and private sector \ndevelopment.  By  enhancing  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  transportation  services  in \nPDMCs,  direct  and  indirect  logistics  costs  should  decrease  and  economic  production  and \nemployment  should  increase,  leading  directly  to  positive  impacts  on  poverty.    In  addition, \nextensive use of domestic consultants will build the local capacity for transportation analysis and \nplanning.   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n19.  The TA seeks to enhance economic development in PDMCs.  That goal will be achieved \nby improving the efficiency and effectiveness of transportation services through reform of public \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2003, Swimming Against the Tide: An Assessment of the Private Sector in the Pacific Region.

", "4 \nsector operations and policies and increased private sector participation in service provision. \nThese  improvements  will  directly  reduce  the  costs  of  trade  and  commerce  and  increase \nemployment, and indirectly reduce the costs of consumer goods, thereby reducing poverty.   \n20.  The  output  will  be  consensus  on  an  effective  and  coordinated  program  to  support \neconomic  development,  in  the  form  of  sector  road  maps  at  regional  and  national  levels. \nConsensus will be achieved by undertaking a systematic and participatory analysis of the \nconstraints to efficient transport markets and identifying pragmatic programs to remove them.  \nThe TA will develop a range of options and involve a variety of participants, including funding \nagencies  and  private  sector  participants,  in  assessing  its  findings  and  identifying  ways  to \nimplement the necessary programs. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n21.  The  TA  methodology  is  intended  to  produce  a  fundamental  understanding  of  the \nefficiency and effectiveness of public and private sector transport services, constraints to their \ndevelopment, and strategies for their improvement.   \n \n22.  Key activities are (i) assessing the logistics costs of the current transport sector by \ncollecting and analyzing data; (ii) analyzing of market structures including public and private \nsector operators, policies, and regulations governing services; (iii) identifying the impacts of \nmarket structure and constraints to improvement and expansion of efficient transport services; \n(iv) recommending improvement to public sector operations, private sector participation, and \nregional  cooperation;  and  (v)  analyzing,  building  consensus,  and  disseminating  of  results \nthrough direct consultations and workshops with relevant stakeholders, reports to ADB, and a \nfinal publication.   \n \n23.  Through these activities, the TA will determine the efficiency of transport services and \ninfrastructure and the relative importance of each transport mode in reducing transport costs in \nthe region.  The TA will seek to identify innovative approaches to service provision and to \nimprove the effective functioning of markets, by removing regulatory constraints and promoting \ncontestable market solutions that are appropriate to small Pacific economies. An enabling \nenvironment will induce private transport services and asset management, and improvement in \nsector  efficiency.  The  TA  will  outline  pragmatic  programs  to  enhance  the  productivity  of \ninfrastructure, policy, and transport operations; and determine opportunities for expanding the \nrole of the private sector.  \n \n24.  The TA will prepare reports that will be discussed in two regional workshops involving \nconsultations at three levels: (i) consultation among ADB and PDMCs on TA administration, \noutputs, and achievements; (ii) consultative meetings with stakeholders to consider progress \nachieved and views and options presented under the TA inception, progress, midterm, and draft \nfinal reports; and (iii) meetings convening aid agencies supporting the transport sectors in the \nPacific region.  The first workshop will be a midterm peer review workshop, at which the \nanalyses of market conditions and structures will be presented, and feedback solicited on the \nidentified impacts  and  constraints.    The  second  workshop  will  be a  sector  road  map  and \nprogram portfolio workshop, at which the recommendations for improvements will be presented, \nand feedback solicited on the feasibility and desirability of  the suggested approaches.   \n \n25.  This process relies on in-depth country focus and comparative examination of impacts of \nconstraints, creation of regional benchmarks, and adaptation of best practices from within and ", "    5 \noutside the region.  Much of the country-specific information will be developed by domestic \nconsultants, thereby building the capacity for analyzing and planning local transportation. \n \n26.  The TA aims to develop consensus at regional and national levels on sector road maps \ncontaining program portfolios, and to identify resource requirements and sources of financing to \nimplement  the  proposed  programs.    Outputs  of  the  TA  will  be  published  to  establish  a \ncompendium that can guide private operators, investors and financiers, PDMC governments, \nfunding agencies, and other parties interested in transport operations in the Pacific region.  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n27.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $467,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on \na grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n28.  Consulting services (33 person-months: 9 international and 24 domestic) in aviation, \nshipping,  and  road  transport  planning  and  economics  are  required,  and  will  be  utilized \nintermittently over 2 years.  Individual consultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB's \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. Outline terms of reference for the consultants are in \nAppendix 4. \n \n29.  ADB  will  be  the  Executing/Implementing  Agency.  ADB\u2019s  Pacific  Department  will  be \nresponsible for the overall and day-to-day monitoring of TA activities. Transport agencies in the \nPDMCs will be counterpart agencies to the study. ADB will also coordinate the TA with regional \ntransport  organizations,  including  the  Pacific  Islands  Forum  Secretariat  and  the  transport \ndivision of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific. \n \n30.  The TA will be implemented over 2 years, starting in June 2004 and ending in May 2006. \nThe consultants will submit inception, quarterly progress, draft final, and final reports. The \nconsultants will organize two workshops with stakeholders, including governments and industry \nrepresentatives.  The first will be a peer review workshop to assess the data collection and \nanalysis phase of the project.  The second will be a program portfolio workshop, held to assess \nthe policy and operational recommendations that are expected.   \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n31.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $467,000 on a grant basis for \na Pacific Regional Transport Analysis, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \n \n       \n  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nDesign Summary

Objectives and Scope \n1.  The overall goal of consulting services is to develop consensus on ways to improve the \nefficiency of transportation services in the Pacific region that will lead to better pricing structures \nfor  exports  and  imports,  improved  conditions  for  private  investment,  greater  employment \ngeneration, and subsequently poverty reduction.  The objectives are to (i) assess the structure, \nmarket conditions, and policy environment of transport services; and (ii) make recommendations \nfor improving the prevailing transport markets.   \n \n2.  The technical assistance (TA) will cover the dominant transport modes in the Pacific: \nroad, shipping, and aviation, including intermodal linkages. It will encompass (i) assessment of \ndirect and indirect logistics costs of each transport subsector; (ii) analysis of market structures \nincluding public and private sector operators, policies, and regulations; (iii) identification of the \nimpacts of market structure and constraints to improvement and expansion of efficient services; \n(iv) recommendations for improving public sector operations, private sector participation, and \nregional cooperation; and (v) development of analyses and dissemination of results through \ndirect  consultations  and  workshops  with  relevant  stakeholders,  reports  to  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), and a final publication.   \n \nB.  International Consultants (9 person-months) \n \n3.
