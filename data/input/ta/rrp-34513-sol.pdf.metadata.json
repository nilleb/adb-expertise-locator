The  economy,  however,  was\ndevastated; major enterprises were shut down, and a\ncontraction in real terms of about 14 percent is expected\nin 2000. About 30,000 people abandoned their homes in\nGuadalcanal Province and relocated to other provinces.\nIn  refugee  communities,  many  are  without  access  to\nbasic  social  services.    Guadalcanal,  in  particular,\nsuffered  extensive  damage  to  infrastructure  and\nessential facilities.  Roads and bridges were destroyed;\nwater supplies were cut; vehicles and equipment were\nstolen or rendered inoperable; and schools, clinics and\ngovernment  offices  were  ransacked  or  demolished.\nOther provinces became severely burdened by the influx\nof  displaced  people.  In  the  wake  of  the  conflict,\nconsiderable economic and social rebuilding is required.\nBorrower Solomon Islands\nExecuting Agency Ministry of Finance (MOF)\nAmount of Loan and Terms A  loan  equivalent  of  $10.0  million  from  Asian\nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) Special Funds resources.\nThe loan will have an amortization period of 32 years,\nincluding a grace period of 8 years. The interest rate will\nbe 1 percent during the grace period and 1.5 percent\nthereafter, with equal amortization.\nPeriod of Utilization The utilization period will be 36 months, with retroactive\nfinancing from 13 November 2000.\nDescription of the Project The  main  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  assist  the\nGovernment of Solomon Islands in restoring essential\nfacilities and services for communities affected by the\nconflict.  The Project covers replacement or restoration\nof  government  offices,  water  supply  and  sanitation\nfacilities, roads, bridges, schools, and health facilities,\nincluding  associated  equipment,  that  were  lost,\ndestroyed, or damaged during the past 18 months as a\nresult of the civil strife.  In parts of Guadalcanal where\ncommunities  remain  or  will  be  reconstituted,  such\ndamaged infrastructure, equipment, and facilities will be\nreplaced  or  repaired  under  the  Project.    However,  in\ncases where affected communities have no prospect of\nreturning  to  Guadalcanal  (due  to  safety  concerns  or\nbecause their homes or means of livelihood have also\nbeen destroyed), the Project will restore or rebuild the", "ii\nessential  infrastructure  and  facilities  in  other  areas,\nparticularly  in  the  province  of  Malaita  where  such\ncommunities are located.  The Project also will provide\nfor consulting services.\nEstimated Cost and Financing ADB will finance the total project cost of $10.0 million\nPlan equivalent  under  its  Emergency  Rehabilitation\nAssistance Loan facility.\nEstimated Project Completion 31 December 2003\nDate\nProcurement of Goods and Consultants  will  be  recruited  under  advance\nServices procurement  action,  and  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines for Procurement, retroactive financing will be\npermitted for eligible items procured from 13 November\n2000 for up to $1 million.\nDisbursement The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with\nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook.  MOF will establish\nand maintain an imprest account for the Project at the\nCentral Bank of Solomon Islands after the loan becomes\neffective.  The ceiling of the imprest account will be $1\nmillion.  The initial advance to the imprest account will be\nbased  on  the  estimated  expenditures  of  the  first  six\nmonths.  The statement of expenditures (SOE) procedure\nwill be used to liquidate/replenish the imprest account\nand to reimburse other eligible expenditures.  The ceiling\nof SOE per individual payment will be $300,000.\nConsulting Services It is proposed that the United Nations Office for Project\nServices (UNOPS) be engaged under the loan to provide\nthe international and domestic consultants for the Project\nManagement  Unit  (PMU).  The  main  tasks  of  the\ninternational  consultants  will  include  overall  Project\nmanagement, covering the planning, design, monitoring,\nand implementation of the subproject activities.  They will\nbe  responsible  for  planning  of  the  subproject\ncomponents,  assessment  of  works  under  various\nsubprojects, writing appropriate technical specifications,\nreviewing detailed designs and bill of quantities of the\ncivil  works,  estimating  costs,  preparation  of  bidding\ndocuments,  tendering  of  the  contract  packages,  bid\nevaluation,  construction  supervision,  monitoring  of  the\nimplementation of the project components, and ensuring\nquality. The consultants are also required to ensure that\nthere  are  mechanisms  in  place  for  effective  local\ncommunity input in the planning of the project activities.\nSuch plans should take into account local community\nviews  and  indigenous  knowledge,  as  well  as  the\nexperience  of  Government  agencies  and  staff.  The", "iii\nconsultants  will  also  be  responsible  for  training  local\ncounterpart  staff  in  design,  documentation,  contract\nadministration,  field  supervision,  and  project\nmanagement. The consultants will design an effective\non-the-job training program for counterparts who will be\nassigned to work with them.\nLocal consultant services will be required for detailed\nassessment  of  damages,  design  and  documentation,\ncommunity  consultation  and  participation,  site\nsupervision of the rehabilitation works, and accounting\nand auditing, among other things. The selection of the\nconsultants will be made in accordance with the ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other\narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of\ndomestic consultants.", "(iv)", "I. THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed\nloan to Solomon Islands for the Post-Conflict Emergency Rehabilitation Project.\nII. INTRODUCTION\n2. The conflict in Solomon Islands has had deep and far-reaching impact on the social and\neconomic situation in the country. The social fabric of the country has been greatly strained and\nsubstantially altered. The economic structure of the country has also been severely damaged\nalong with almost complete erosion of private sector confidence. Around 8,000 people (around\n20 percent of the formal sector workforce) lost jobs or were placed on indefinite unpaid leave.\nAbout 30,000 people abandoned their homes in Guadalcanal Province and relocated to other\nprovinces.    In  refugee  communities,  many  are  without  access  to  basic  social  services.\nGuadalcanal, in particular, suffered extensive damage to infrastructure and essential facilities.\nRoad and bridges were destroyed; water supplies were cut; vehicles and equipment were stolen\nor  rendered  inoperable;  and  schools,  clinics,  and  government  offices  were  ransacked  or\ndemolished.  The total damage suffered has been estimated at $30 million-$35 million.  Other\nprovinces were severely burdened by the influx of refugees.  In the wake of the conflict,\nconsiderable economic and social rebuilding is required.\n3. A peace agreement signed on 15 October 2000 is expected to lead to disarmament of\nthe two militant groups. However, the situation remains fragile because many issues, including\ncompensation  and  the  proposed  self-government  of  several  provinces,  require  further\ndeliberation.  Early  revival  of  economic  activities  and  return  to  normalcy  hold  the  key  to\ncementing the peace process and putting the country back on the path of sustainable growth. In\nthe  near  term,  implementing  the  agreement  will  entail  significant  assistance  from  external\nsources,  including  support  for  disarmament,  social  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation  of  the\nessential physical and social infrastructure.\n4. The key members of the donor community1 agreed on the need for a comprehensive\nand coordinated framework for external support to Solomon Islands. At the request of the\nGovernment, it was agreed that a multidonor assessment mission would visit Solomon Islands\nas soon as the security situation permitted. Subsequently, an Asian Development Bank (ADB)\nMission  was  fielded  from  4-12  November  20002  as  part  of  the  multidonor  mission.  Other\nparticipants  were  Australia,  the  International  Monetary  Fund,  Japan,  New  Zealand,  United\nKingdom, and World Bank. The ADB Mission held discussions with officials of the Government\nand reached an understanding on a proposed Post-Conflict Emergency Rehabilitation Project.\nDuring this process, the ADB Mission was in full consultation with other aid agencies involved in\nthe multidonor mission.\n                                                \n1 The following sources of aid met informally in August 2000 to consider their respective approaches in providing\nassistance to Solomon Islands' peace building and economic recovery: Asian Development Bank, Australia,\nEuropean  Union,  International  Monetary  Fund,  Japan,  New  Zealand,  United  Kingdom,  United  Nations\nDevelopment Programme, and the World Bank. Officials from the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of\nSolomon Islands participated in the meeting.\n2  The Mission comprised R. Siy Jr.,OIC, Area A, POHQ; D. Sharan, Economist, POHQ;  and R. Ram Adhar, Senior\nProject Implementation Officer, SPRM.", "2\n5. The loan is proposed under ADB\u2019s facility for rehabilitation assistance after disasters.\nThe facility includes abbreviated and flexible loan processing and approval procedures.\nIII. BACKGROUND\nA.  The Situation\n1.  The Conflict\n6. Economic and social development in Solomon Islands, before and after independence in\n1978,  centered  mainly  in  and  around  the  capital,  Honiara,  on  the  island  province  of\nGuadalcanal. In 1998, of about 35,000 persons employed in the formal sector, over 51 percent\nwere  in  Honiara.  Many  from  other  provinces  migrated  to  Guadalcanal  in  search  of  better\nopportunities. The largest number of migrants came from Malaita Province.  Over time, the\npressure and economic competition from migrants raised tensions between the largest group of\nmigrants of Malaitan origin and the native population of Guadalcanal. The conflict started to\nbuild toward the end of 1998, when an armed group of militants from Guadalcanal, first known\nas the Guadalcanal Revolutionary Army and later called the Isatabu Freedom Movement (IFM),\nforced settlers of Malaitan origin to leave the island of Guadalcanal. The dispute grew into a\nviolent conflict by mid-1999 and resulted in loss of lives, major damage to property, substantial\ndisruption of economic activity, and large displacement of people. By the end of 1999, a militant\ngroup of Malaitan origin, known as the Malaitan Eagle Force (MEF), was formed in retaliation.\n7. The MEF took control of Honiara and detained the Prime Minister on 5 June 2000,\nleading  to  his  resignation.  By  the  end  of  June  2000,  a  new  coalition  for  national  unity,\nreconciliation, and peace formed a Government with peace as its priority. An agreement for the\ncessation of hostilities between the MEF and IFM, and for restoration of peace and social\nharmony in Solomon Islands was signed on 15 October 2000 in Townsville, Australia.\n2. The Economy\n8. Solomon Islands is an archipelago with a land area of 28,000 square kilometers (km2) in\nthe South Pacific. The total population of the country, based on the 1999 census, was 409,042.\nSolomon Islands comprises six main islands and more than 900 others that stretch across 1,300\nkm of the Pacific Ocean. About 80 percent of the land is rugged mountain terrain. With a large\nendowment of natural resources, including an exclusive economic zone of 1.3 million km2, the\ncountry has the potential for sustainable development and a self-reliant economy. However, this\npotential is far from realized.\n9. The country has a narrow production base in the secondary sector, which contributes\nabout 15 percent to total output. The primary and tertiary sectors, respectively, account for 40\nand 45 percent of output. More than half of primary sector output is in the non-monetary rural-\nbased subsistence sector, to which about 80 percent of the population belong. Logs, fish,\ncoconut products, oil palm, cocoa, and gold are the main exports of the country. Oil, food, and\nplant, vehicle and transport equipment are the main imports of the country.\n10. Solomon Islands is one of the poorest Pacific developing member countries of ADB,\nmanifesting low human development and high human poverty indices, according to the 1999\nPacific Human Development Report of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).", "3\nThe country\u2019s Human Poverty Index (HPI) of 49.1 places it in the company of many poor\ncountries in sub-Saharan Africa.  Country economic and social indicators are presented in\nAppendix 1.\n11. At the beginning of 1999, the economy was expected to experience steady growth.\nHowever, from mid-1999, economic activity, government finances, and the balance of payments\nbegan to deteriorate following the escalation of social tensions and unrest. The deterioration in\nthe economy was further aggravated by the events of June 2000. The economy in 2000 is\nexpected to contract by about 14 percent in real terms. The worst affected sectors include\nmining (-50 percent), construction (-50 percent), fishing (-42 percent), agriculture (-30 percent),\nwater and electricity (-20 percent), and wholesale trade (-20 percent). While there are some\nsigns of economic revival following the peace agreement, major enterprises in mining, fishing,\nand agriculture remain closed, and the prospects for 2001 will largely depend on how soon the\ncountry returns to normality.\n12. Government finances are in serious crisis with government revenues estimated to fall\nshort of the budget 2000 estimates by over 30 percent. The largest decline is expected in the\ncorporation  tax  (-60  percent),  followed  by  import  duty  (-50  percent)  and  export  duty  (-33\npercent).  The  Government  introduced  a  minibudget  (August-December  2000),  projecting  a\ndeficit of SI$160 million  (SI$5.16 = $1).   A significantly higher expenditure was budgeted for\nthe five months due to payments related to peace building and peacekeeping. Notable features\nof the minibudget include minimal development expenditure and a continuation of unpaid leave\nfor about 800 public officers. The overall budget balance in 2000 is projected to be a deficit\nequivalent  to  4.5  percent  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP).  The  total  stock  of  central\ngovernment debt at end of 2000 is projected to reach 75 percent of GDP, with about 60 percent\nof the same in external debt. So far, the Government has managed generally to meet its debt\nservice obligations, but arrears in other expenditure areas are rising, indicating the possibility of\ndefault on debt obligations.\n13. Because of lower domestic demand and import prices, inflation has generally been\nfalling since the second half of 1999.  Inflation was 6.1 percent in May 2000 and is expected to\nremain low during the year, despite higher oil prices. Total domestic credit increased by 12\npercent in the nine months to September 2000, with most credit to the private sector extended\nin the first half of 2000. Broad money supply is projected to grow at 9.5 percent in 2000.\nExports in 2000 are expected to decline by about 29 percent in US dollar terms because of\ndisruption of production. Imports are also expected to decline by about 15 percent in US dollar\nterms largely due to low demand for imported goods. External reserves fell sharply after the\ncrisis, but improved subsequently as receipts from log exports improved. Exchange control\nmeasures also helped the improvement. Gross external reserves are projected to be $33.4\nmillion at the end of 2000, sufficient to cover only a little over two months of imports. The\nexternal position of the country remains fragile.\nB.  External Assistance\n14. Because of severe financial constraints, the Government is not in a position to finance\nany of the reconstruction work in the near term. It has therefore requested assistance from\nbilateral and other multilateral agencies.  Although the possible contributions of various sources\nare yet unclear, there are some initial indications of assistance. Assistance from Australian\nAgency for International Development (AusAID) is expected to focus on security and peace\nbuilding, support for health services, and small-scale community-based activities.  New Zealand\nis expected to support peace building, secondary education, small business development, and", "4\ncommunity-based initiatives.  The United Kingdom is likely to support education and public\ninformation.  Japan is also a contributor to the peace building and security efforts and to\ngrassroots  reconstruction  work.    The  World  Bank  has  a  new  health  project  and  a  nearly\ncomplete  education  project  with  some  savings;  in  both  cases,  project  resources  may  be\nredirected to finance rehabilitation of damaged facilities. Various United Nations agencies are\ninvolved in aspects of peace making, disarmament and social reconstruction activities.  The\nEuropean Commission may also be able to reorient some of its ongoing and approved projects\nfor  reconstruction  and  rehabilitation  efforts.    Untied  grants  are  also  anticipated  from\nTaipei,China, although the amounts have not been confirmed.\nIV.  THE PROPOSED REHABILITATION ASSISTANCE\nA. Extent of Damage\n15. The  social  unrest  in  Solomon  Islands  caused  extensive  damage  to  transport\ninfrastructure,  schools,  water  supply  and  sanitation  systems,  government  and  provincial\nbuildings, and health centers on the island of Guadalcanal and in nearby provinces. The total\ndamage, estimated at $30 million - $35 million, has placed a severe strain on government\nservices in the affected provinces. This is further compounded by a fiscal crisis under which\nmany civil servants have been sent on indefinite leave without pay. In Guadalcanal, farmers, in\nparticular, are finding it difficult to move their produce and livestock to markets. The tourist\nindustry has also been affected by damage to, and current inaccessibility of, resorts around the\ncoast of Guadalcanal.\n16. Heavy machinery used by the militants during the unrest damaged many sections of the\nmain and adjacent roads in Guadalcanal. The sections of eastern and western Guadalcanal\nmain roads were excavated by militants and used as bunkers. Thirteen bridges along the above\nroads were damaged, severing transportation links to the city. The sealed roads in the capital\ncity were also extensively damaged.  The Nagalimbu Bridge, which provides access to two of\nthe country\u2019s largest enterprises, Gold Ridge Mining and Solomon Islands Plantations Limited\n(an oil palm plantation), is in danger of collapse. In addition, 14 timber pile bridges on Malaita\nhave been severely weakened under the load of heavy equipment and other vehicles stolen by\nmilitants and shipped to the island.\n17. In Guadalcanal, militants damaged the Honiara Water Supply, leaving more than 2/3\n(around 25,000 people) of Honiara\u2019s population without access to safe water. Because about\n30,000 people were displaced, the population of other provinces has sharply increased (in\nTemotu Province, for example, the population has risen by over 50 percent). Most schools in\nGuadalcanal were damaged or destroyed; schoolchildren have not returned to school. The\nprovincial  headquarters  building  in  Guadalcanal  was  damaged,  while  that  of  the  Central\nProvince  was  burned  down  by  militants,  disabling  communication  and  services  to  rural\ncommunities. Health facilities were similarly ruined.  Several area health centers and associated\nstaff houses were burned down, and rural health clinics and nurse aide posts, damaged. The\nGovernment is giving high priority to restoring damaged infrastructure on Guadalcanal and\nproviding social infrastructure in other provinces where displaced people have resettled.\nB. Selection of Works\n18. The main objective of the Project is to assist the Government in restoring essential\nfacilities and services for communities affected by the conflict.  The Project covers replacement", "5\nor  restoration  of  government  offices,  water  supply  and  sanitation  facilities,  roads,  bridges,\nschools,  health  other  essential  facilities,  including  associated  equipment,  that  were  lost,\ndestroyed, or damaged during the past 18 months as a result of the civil strife.  Subprojects for\nADB financing will be selected in accordance with ADB\u2019s policy of financing urgent rehabilitation\nrequirements, primarily to establish the status quo before the conflict.  The project framework is\ngiven in Appendix 2.\nC. Rehabilitation Program\n19. In parts of Guadalcanal where communities remain or will be reconstituted, damaged\ninfrastructure, equipment, and facilities will be replaced or repaired under the Project.  However,\nin cases where affected communities have no prospect of returning to Guadalcanal (due to\nsafety concerns or because their homes or means of livelihood had also been destroyed), the\nProject will restore or rebuild the essential infrastructure and facilities in the areas of other\nprovinces, particularly in the province of Malaita, where such communities are located.  The\nProject will also provide consulting services. The Project, with a duration of three years, is\nexpected to begin in January 2001. An indicative list of works that may be included in the\nProject is given in Appendix 3.\n20. The  Government  has  requested  an  emergency  rehabilitation  loan  of  $10  million\nequivalent from ADB to finance expenditures associated with the reconstruction work.  The\nproposed loan, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, will finance all foreign and local costs of\nselected subprojects.  The financing of the total project cost under the proposed loan is justified\nby the severe economic crisis and by the need for the Government to adhere as closely as\npossible to fiscally responsible budget targets.\n21. The term of the loan will be 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years.  The interest\ncharge  will  be  1  percent  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5  percent  thereafter,  with  equal\namortization. Loan utilization will be for three years.\nD.  Implementation Arrangements\n1. The Executing Agency\n22. The Executing Agency for the Project will be the Ministry of Finance (MOF).  A Project\nManagement Unit (PMU) staffed by international and domestic consultants will be established to\nhandle project administration.  The PMU will have a full-time project manager (an international\nconsultant) and operate under the direction of a Project Steering Committee (PSC), comprising\nsenior representatives from the ministries of finance, development planning, national unity, and\nconcerned sectoral ministries.  The committee will oversee implementation of the Project.  The\nPSC, to be chaired by the permanent secretary of finance, should be established and convened\nby MOF within two weeks after loan approval.  The PMU will also serve as the secretariat for the\nPSC.  For the first year, the PSC will meet monthly to discuss and approve the proposed work\nprogram and the prioritization of subprojects, evaluate project progress, assist the PMU to\nresolve any problems or constraints affecting implementation, and provide guidance on the\nGovernment\u2019s policies during implementation.  From year 2, the PSC will meet on a quarterly\nbasis.  Local  area  consultative  groups  -  comprising  representatives  from  the  provincial\ngovernment, non-government organizations (NGOs), churches, landowners, and community\nleaders - will be established to discuss project activities. Their views will be considered in design\nand implementation of the project components.", "6\n2. Consulting Services\n23. It is proposed that the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) be engaged\nunder the Project to provide the international and domestic consultants for the PMU. The direct\nselection is justified by the unique experience and expertise of United Nations agencies in\ncoordinating relief and rehabilitation work in post-conflict situations.  The main tasks of the\ninternational consultants will include overall project management:  planning, design, monitoring,\nand implementation of the subproject activities.  The consultants will be responsible for proper\nplanning  of  the  subproject  components,  assess  works  under  various  subprojects,  write\nappropriate technical specifications, review detailed designs and bill of quantities of the civil\nworks, estimate costs, prepare bidding documents, tender the contract packages, evaluate bids,\nsupervise construction, monitor implementation of the project components, and ensure quality.\nThe consultants will also ensure that mechanisms are in place for effective local community\ninput in planning the project activities. Such plans should take into account local community\nviews and indigenous knowledge, as well as the experience of Government agencies and staff.\nThe  consultants  will  also  be  responsible  for  training  local  counterpart  staff  in  design,\ndocumentation,  contract  administration,  field  supervision,  and  project  management.  The\nconsultants will design an effective on-the-job training program for counterparts who will be\nassigned to work with them.  The outline terms of reference for the consultants are given in\nAppendix 4.\n24. Local consulting services will be required for detailed assessment of damages, design\nand  documentation,  community  consultation  and  participation,  site  supervision  of  the\nrehabilitation works, and accounting and auditing, among other things. The consultants will be\nselected  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other\narrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants.\n3. Procurement\n25. The PMU will procure civil works and goods in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on\nProcurement. All civil works contracts estimated to cost more than $500,000 will be procured\nthrough ADB\u2019s international shopping procedures from prequalified contractors. To promote the\nlocal construction industry, its participation in joint ventures will be encouraged. Civil works\ncontracts estimated to cost $500,000 or less will be awarded to prequalified contractors using\nthe  Government\u2019s  local  competitive  bidding  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  To  expedite\nrehabilitation  measures,  direct  purchase  procedures  will  apply  in  procuring  of  construction\nmaterials,  and  hiring  or  purchasing  equipment  for  contracts  estimated  to  cost  less  than\n$100,000.    In  cases  where  international  shopping  will  apply,  procurement  notices  will  be\nadvertised in Honolulu, USA; New Zealand; and Australia to ensure sufficient competition.\n4. Disbursements\n26. The  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement\nHandbook.  MOF will establish and maintain an imprest account for the Project at the Central\nBank of Solomon Islands after the loan becomes effective.  The ceiling of the imprest account is\n$1.0 million with the initial advance being based on the estimated expenditures for the first six\nmonths.    The  ADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditures  (SOE)  procedure  will  be  used  to\nliquidate/replenish the imprest account and to reimburse other eligible expenditures.  The ceiling\nfor any individual payment is $300,000.  Withdrawal applications will be prepared by the PMU", "7\nand signed by the secretary of finance.  The imprest account and SOE will be audited by an\nindependent auditor acceptable to ADB.  A separate audit opinion on the use of the imprest\naccount and the SOE procedure will be included in the annual audit report.\n5. Advance Action and Retroactive Financing\n27. Consultants  are  being  recruited  under  advance  procurement  action.    Retroactive\nfinancing will be permitted for eligible items procured from 13 November 2000 for up to $1\nmillion.\n6. Reports, Accounts and Audits\n28.
