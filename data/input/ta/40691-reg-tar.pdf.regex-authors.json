Since the adoption of the agriculture and natural resources research (ANRR) policy \npaper in 1995, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has supported the Consultative Group on \nInternational  Agricultural  Research  (CGIAR)  centers  and  other  non-CGIAR  international \nagricultural research centers (IARCs)1 through an annual regional technical assistance (RETA) \ngrant. ADB\u2019s policy on ANRR addresses three strategic objectives: (i) sustainable management \nof natural resources, (ii) increases in agricultural productivity, and (iii) poverty reduction. Eleven \nRETA grants have so far been approved, each supporting one or several projects of IARCs. The \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  completion  reports  of  the  first  four  ANRR  RETAs  have  been \ncompleted and the draft TA completion reports for the fifth and sixth ANRR RETAs are being \nprepared. All RETAs have been rated as successful and the outcomes have strengthened \nknowledge products and technical agriculture research and extension operations in numerous \ndeveloping member countries (DMCs), and have supported ADB\u2019s operations in the agriculture \nand natural resources (ANR) sector. The IARCs work in virtually all of ADB\u2019s DMCs, and several \nhave their headquarters in Asian DMCs. \n \n2.  A special evaluation study2 of the ANRR policy carried out in 2000 recommended \ncontinued support to the IARCs, given the high returns on investments, relevance of the policy \nand research outputs of supported projects, and overall effectiveness of the annual RETA \nmodality. While the ANRR policy specifies yearly ADB funding of $5.0 million to support ANRR, \nthe support has been decreasing since 2000. It amounted to $3.0 million in 2003 and 2004, and \n$1.0 million in 2005 and 2006. The RETAs have played an integral role in fulfilling ADB\u2019s \noperational objectives in participating DMCs. They have also addressed, in varying degrees, \nADB\u2019s overarching goal of poverty reduction and related priorities such as regional cooperation \nand sustainable environmental management. \n \n3.  The  proposed  RETA3  will  be  the  twelfth  RETA  on  ANRR.  Employing  the  criteria \nestablished in the Guidelines on Submission of Project Proposals4 for RETAs on ANRR, the \nregional directors of the agriculture, environment, and natural resources divisions; and the \nagriculture, natural resources, and social services division assessed the 20 concept notes that \nhad been received by September 2007 for consideration under the twelfth RETA on ANRR. \nProject proposals were prioritized by level of preparation, links with ADB\u2019s poverty reduction \nstrategy, and relevance and synergy with ADB operations. Considering the total funds available \nfor 2007, two proposals were selected for inclusion in the proposed RETA: (i) one submitted by \nthe International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA), and (ii) another by \nthe International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT). The two are \nexpected to promote the development, application, and dissemination of scientific research on \nproblems faced by poor farmer households in Asia. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  In September 2000, heads of state adopted the Millennium Declaration confirming their \ncountries\u2019 commitment to achieving the Millennium Development Goals, a set of eight quantified \n                                                 \n1  For purposes of this technical assistance (TA), the international agricultural research centers are the International \nCenter for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas and the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid \nTropics. \n2  ADB. 2000.

Manila. \n ", "2   \nand specific time-bound targets for addressing the many dimensions of extreme poverty\u2014from \nincome poverty, hunger, health, education, environment, and gender. One of the Millennium \nDeclaration\u2019s most decisive goals, the first goal, aims at eradicating extreme poverty and hunger \nby reducing by half, between 1990 and 2015, the proportion of people living on less than $1 a \nday and of people suffering from hunger. \n \n5.  Despite  recent  progress,  especially  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC),  Asia \ncontinues to be home to two thirds of the world\u2019s absolutely poor and food-insecure people. \nAbout 600 million people in Asia (down from 934 million in 1990) are absolutely poor, living on \nless than $1 a day.  Around 520 million (down from 570 million in 1990) lack sufficient access to \nfood to lead healthy and productive lives. Given that the majority of poor people live in rural \nareas and rely on agriculture, and that agriculture paves the way for economic growth in poorer \nnations, the agriculture sector continues to underlie progress on the broad array of economic \nand social indicators emphasized by the Millennium Development Goals, in particular the first \ngoal.5\n \n6.  While 75% of the world\u2019s poor live in rural areas in developing countries, a mere 4% of \nofficial development assistance goes to agriculture.6 Investing in ANRR is one of the most \neffective means of reducing poverty and stimulating agricultural and economic growth, through \nimprovements  in  productivity.  A  recent  study  carried  out  a  comprehensive  survey  of  the \nliterature on agricultural research since 1953 and statistically analyzed reported rates of return. \nIts  results  showed  that,  despite  wide  variability,  average  rates  of  return  are  very  high. \nFurthermore, the study found no evidence to support the view that rates of return have declined \nover time.7\n \n7.  In Asia, one of the most urgent and rewarding area for research is to develop effective \ntechnologies,  institutions,  and  policies  to  deal  with  environmental  changes  due  to  land \ndegradation and climate change. In Central Asia, the most important challenges facing the \nagriculture sector include depletion of soil nutrients, salinization, soil erosion, and other forms of \nland degradation. Recent estimates show that over 50% of irrigated soils in Central Asia are \nsalinized or waterlogged. In many areas, policies to promote food security particularly through \nraising wheat production have promoted unsustainable agricultural production practices. In the \nsemi-arid tropic regions of Asia, agriculture is highly vulnerable to climate change. Climate \nchange is likely to make rain-fed agriculture even more risk-prone, and farmers and farming \nsystems  will  need  to  adapt  to  these  changes.  However,  adaptation  by  vulnerable  and \nimpoverished communities to new, evolving, and as yet uncertain climatic conditions in the \nfuture poses huge challenges.\n \n8.  CGIAR, created in 1971, is a strategic alliance of countries, international and regional \norganizations, and private foundations supporting 15 IARCs that work with national agricultural \nresearch systems (NARS) and civil society organizations, including the private sector. It aims to \nachieve sustainable food security and reduce poverty through scientific agricultural research. \nCGIAR\u2019s areas of focus are sustainable production, enhancing NARS, germplasm collection \nand improvement, and policy. CGIAR has been the driving force behind the Green Revolution. It \nhas  spearheaded  international  agricultural  research  and  acted  as  the  focus  for  global \n                                                 \n5  Rosegrant, Mark W., Claudia Ringler, Todd Benson, Xinshen Diao, Danielle Resnick, James Thurlow, Maximo \nTorero, and David Orden. 2005.

", "  3\ninvestment in research for development. A recent study on the benefits of CGIAR research \nagainst the cost of operating the whole system up to 2001 found that the value of documented \nbenefits generated by CGIAR surpasses the total investment in the system even when analyzed \nfrom the most conservative perspective.8\n \n9.  Most outcomes of agricultural research are of the public goods type and can be justified \nunder grant financing. In Asia, ANRR has played an important role in promoting agricultural and \nrural development over the past 3 decades, and ADB as the key development institution in Asia \nhas significant potential to further expand that role. Changes that ANRR has set in place have \ncontributed to agricultural productivity increases and a reduction of poverty. According to the \nspecial evaluation study (footnote 2), ADB investments have paid large dividends. For the \nsubset of projects assessed in the special evaluation study, the average internal rate of return \nfor all funds invested in the projects was 65%.  \n \n10.  The proposed RETA builds on the experience of previous ADB-funded RETAs on ANRR. \nIt  notes  the  finding  of the  special  evaluation  study  that,  given  ADB\u2019s  limited  resources  to \ncontribute to ANRR, a focused agenda that more closely follows ADB\u2019s overarching goal of \npoverty reduction is required. The design of the RETA also incorporates key lessons from  \nprevious RETAs, including the need for greater emphasis on (i) strengthening NARS capacity; \n(ii) improving linkages among researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to better disseminate \nresearch results; and (iii) strengthening ADB\u2019s capacity to coordinate, supervise, monitor, and \nevaluate ANR activities. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The  proposed  RETA  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  ANRR,  and  reinforces  the \npriorities outlined in ADB\u2019s Medium-Term Strategy II and the Enhanced Poverty Reduction \nStrategy. The RETA aims at formulating, adopting, and implementing land degradation policies \nand strategies and reducing the vulnerability to climate change in the participating target DMCs. \nFor purposes of Component 1, the target DMCs are PRC, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, \nPakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan; for the purposes of Component 2, the \ntarget DMCs are Bangladesh, PRC, India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka; Component 3 covers all \nDMCs. The outcome of the RETA is enhanced knowledge base and capacity in the participating \nDMCs to analyze the binding factors, and to recommend and formulate polices and strategies \nfor  reducing  vulnerabilities  from  land  degradation  and  climate  change.  The  design  and \nmonitoring framework of the RETA is in Appendix 1.  \n  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The proposed RETA will have three components: (i) analysis of the existing land use \npolicy, and institutional and environmental factors that influence land degradation; identification \nfor  policy  options  to  support  the  adoption  of  improved  sustainable  land  management \ntechnologies that combat land degradation and improve productivity, and recommendation for \nconducive  policies  and  strategies  for  promoting  improved  development  pathways  and \nlivelihoods based on sustainable land management; (ii) analysis of climate variability and its \nimpact  on  cropping  pattern,  structures  of  income  and  employment,  and  adaptation-coping \nstrategies of the rural poor, identification of best practices and institutional innovations for \n                                                 \n8  Raitser, D.A. 2003.

The first two components have been identified \nin close consultation with participating DMCs,9 and will be implemented independently by two \nIARCs: ICARDA and ICRISAT. The last component will support ANR activities within ADB by (i) \nstrengthening in-house ANR capacities and networks, (ii) organizing ANR seminars, and (iii) \nsupporting small-scale agriculture and natural resources sector analysis. A summary of ADB\u2019s \nassistance to IARCs, including CGIAR, is in Appendix 2. The synopses of the components are \nin paras. 13\u201317, and the detailed project descriptions are in Appendix 3.  \n \n13.  Component  1.  Enabling  Policy  Options  for  Sustainable  Land  Management  in \nCentral Asia, PRC, and Pakistan. Through the adoption and application within the national \ndevelopment  programs  of  the  recommended  policies  that  promote  sustainable  land \nmanagement  practices,  the  proposed  component  will  assist  in  restoring,  maintaining,  and \nenhancing  land  productivity  in  PRC,  Kazakhstan,  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Pakistan,  Tajikistan, \nTurkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.  \n \n14.  Key activities will include (i) analyzing the existing land use policy, and institutional and \nenvironmental factors that influence land degradation; (ii) supporting the adoption of improved \nsustainable  land  management  technologies  that  combat  land  degradation  and  improve \nproductivity; and (iii) developing recommendations for conducive policy options and strategies \nfor  promoting  improved  development  pathways  and  livelihood,  based  on  sustainable  land \nmanagement. \n \n15.  Component 2. Vulnerability to Climate Change: Adaptation Strategies and Layers \nof Resilience. The proposed component will provide science-based solutions and pro-poor \napproaches for adapting agricultural systems to climate change for the rural poor and most \nvulnerable farmers in semi-arid regions of Asia, particularly Bangladesh, PRC, India, Pakistan, \nand Sri Lanka. It will identify and prioritize the sectors most at risk and develop gender-equitable \nagricultural adaptation and mitigation strategies as an integral part of agricultural development \nin these less-favored areas. Component 2 will cover innovations in agricultural institutions, the \nrole of women, social capital, and social networks. \n \n16.  Key activities comprise (i) seeking an improved understanding of climate variability and \nits impact on cropping patterns, structures of income and employment, and adaptation-coping \nstrategies of the rural poor in the semi-arid tropic villages; (ii) promoting best practices and \ninstitutional  innovations  for  mitigating  the  effects  of  climate  change;  and  (iii)  formulating \nstrategies  to  address  socioeconomic  problems  relating  to  changing  weather  patterns  and \nexamining a range of initiatives for their alleviation. \n \n17.  Component  3.  Developing  Capacity  for  ANR-Related  Activities.  The  project \nresponds to the key lesson and needs identified so as to enhance ADB\u2019s in-house capacity to \neffectively coordinate, supervise, monitor, evaluate, and strengthen ANR activities and networks \nwith CGIAR and other non-CGIAR IARCs. The proposed component will establish an ANR \nsecretariat and provide support to ADB\u2019s in-house ANR activities including reports, conferences, \nseminars, publication, dissemination, and networking as well as small-scale agriculture and \nnatural resources sector analysis. ADB\u2019s ANR focal point in the East Asia Department will take \n                                                 \n9  A no-objection letter has been sent to each participating DMC to obtain its concurrence. No-objection letters will be \nobtained in each DMC as a condition to ADB financing under the TA.

The total cost of the RETA is estimated at $2.863 million equivalent. ADB will finance \n$2.000 million, comprising $0.775 million for Component 1, $1.100 million for Component 2, and \n$0.125 million for Component 3. The financing will be on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding \nprogram. With respect to component 1, ICARDA will contribute $0.227 million equivalent in kind \nin the form of staff time and administrative and support costs over 3 years; and the governments \nof PRC, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan, \nthrough NARS, will together provide $0.126 million equivalent in kind, in the form of staff time, \nadministration  and  support  costs,  office  facilities,  transport,  and  research  operations  and \nsupplies over 3 years as well. With respect to component 2, ICRISAT will contribute $0.260 \nmillion equivalent in kind in the form of staff time and administrative and support costs over 3 \nyears; and the governments of Bangladesh, PRC, India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, through \nNARS, will together provide $0.250 million equivalent in kind in the form of staff time, office \nequipment,  training  and  workshops,  surveys  and  database  development,  information \ndissemination, and administrative support over 3 years as well. The detailed cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 4. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  The RETA will follow the implementation arrangements used in previous ADB-financed \nRETAs for ANRR. ADB will enter into separate TA agreements with each IARC. Each executing \nagency (EA) will be responsible for implementing and completing its own component. ICARDA, \nthrough its head office in Damascus, Syria, and in partnership with the International Food Policy \nResearch Institute, will be the EA for Component 1. ICRISAT, with its head office in Andhra \nPradesh, India, will be the EA for Component 2. The 10 participating NARS10 will be designated \nas the implementing agencies (IAs), and will collaborate closely with the IARCs. Each EA will \nappoint a project team coordinator, either a current IARC staff or externally recruited consultants, \nwho will coordinate, plan, and supervise all local project activities; monitor project progress; and \nsubmit required reports to ADB and other collaborating partners. Similarly, each IA will appoint a \ncountry team coordinator who will be responsible for coordinating, implementing, and reporting \non the project activities.  \n \n20.  The RETA is expected to start in January 2008 and be completed in December 2010. \nICARDA and ICRISAT will start to implement the TA after ADB\u2019s satisfactory review of the \ndetailed work program including staffing to ensure close coordination with other related ongoing \nprograms and partners at the provincial and national levels in the participating countries. Each \nproject will hold an inception workshop within 3 months after it starts, to firm up project plans \nand implementation arrangements with partners. Each IARC will also organize annual planning \nand review meetings and a project completion workshop that all project partners, including ADB, \nwill attend. Each IARC must submit the following reports to ADB: (i) an inception report; (ii) \nsemiannual progress reports; (iii) semiannual financial statements accounting for the use of \n                                                 \n10 The 10 national agricultural research systems are (i) Center for Policy Dialogue in Bangladesh; (ii) Central \n  Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture in India; (iii) Kazakh Research Institute of Soil Sciences in Kazakhstan; \n  (iv) Kyrgyz Research Institute of Agriculture in Kyrgyz Republic; (v) Pakistan Agricultural Research Council in \n  Pakistan; (vi) Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences in the PRC; (vii) Council for Agricultural Research Policy \n  in Sri Lanka; (viii) Tajik Research Institute of Soil Sciences in Tajikistan; (ix) National Institute of Deserts, Flora, and \n  Fauna in Turkmenistan; and (x) Central Asian Research Institute of Irrigation in Uzbekistan.   \n ", "6   \nproject funds; (iv) audited annual financial statements, including the use of project funds; and (v) \na draft final completion report to obtain ADB comments before the final report is submitted. The \ninception  reports  will  be  submitted  within  3  months  of  the  start  of  each  component;  the \nsemiannual progress reports and financial statements, every 6 months; and the comprehensive \ncompletion report, within 3 months of project closure. Funds will be drawn down in semiannual \ninstallments  based  on  each  IARC\u2019s  estimate  of  forthcoming  expenditures,  and  subject  to \nsatisfactory  liquidation  of  expenditures  for  previously  disbursed  funds.  Project  officers  with \nsuitable technical expertise will be assigned to administer the components at ADB, and will \nundertake at least one supervisory mission yearly to each component.  \n \n21.  The participating IARCs will procure goods and related services in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (as amended from time to time) and will engage consultants in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (as amended from time to time) \nand other arrangements satisfactory to ADB. At the end of each project, equipment purchased \nunder the RETA will be assigned to the EA and IAs concerned. Disbursement under the RETA \nwill be undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Disbursement of TA Grants (as \namended from time to time). \n \n22.  The IARCs have made plans for disseminating the outputs and evaluating the outcome. \nThe outputs will be published in academic journals, books, and reports as well as posted on \nIARCs\u2019  websites  and  ADB  websites.  A  comprehensive  media  dissemination  plan  will  be \ndeveloped during TA implementation. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n23.
