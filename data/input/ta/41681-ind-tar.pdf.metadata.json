During  the  preparation  of  the  Madhya  Pradesh  Power  Sector  Investment  Program \n(MPPSIP), the Government of India asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to support the \noperations of the Energy Conservation Fund through technical assistance (TA) to promote the \nculture of energy efficiency in Madhya Pradesh.1 ADB conducted a Fact-Finding Mission 26\u201329 \nNovember  2007  and  reached  an  understanding  with  the  Government  on  the  scope,  cost \nestimates, financing, implementing arrangements, and the consultants\u2019 terms of reference of the \nproposed TA.2  The design and monitoring framework of the TA is in Appendix 1.   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  India possesses substantial unrealized potential for energy conservation to bridge supply \ngaps, with energy savings possible in commercial and government-owned buildings, industry, \nagriculture,  and  domestic  sectors.  With  proper  policies,  awareness,  and  training,  energy \nconservation and efficiency could increase the competitiveness of consumers, ensure better \nsupply of energy to needy consumers, and reduce the burden on power sector companies \nduring peak supply hours. The Government\u2019s strategy to make power available to all by 2012 \nincludes the promotion of energy conservation and efficiency, which is considered the least-cost \noption to fill the gap between demand and supply. Energy efficiency alone could create nearly \n25,000  megawatts  (MW)  of  capacity,  according  to  estimates  of  the  Government.  Energy \nconservation potential for the economy as a whole has been assessed at 23% of the energy \ngeneration,  with  industry  and  agriculture  showing  the  most  potential.  The  Government \nacknowledges  the  need  for  energy  conservation  and  efficiency,  and  enacted  the  Energy \nConservation Act (ECA) in 2001 to tap the vast potential of energy conservation and efficiency \nbenefits.  The  ECA  provides  the  legal  framework,  institutional  arrangement,  and  regulatory \nmechanism  at  the  central  and  state  levels  to  embark  upon  an  energy  conservation  and \nefficiency drive in India.  \n \n3.  Although the benefits of energy efficiency are well known, a variety of barriers faced by \nenergy users have impeded investments in energy conservation and efficiency. These include (i) \nrisk averseness and lack of motivation to make energy efficiency investments, (ii) low credibility \nof  energy  auditors  and  their  services,  and  (iii)  lack  of  confidence  in  the  ability  of  energy \nefficiency equipment to deliver energy savings as expected. In addition, resource constraints \nand the high cost of financing, when available, have severely limited implementation progress of \nenergy efficiency projects. Therefore, the Government, through the ECA, mandated the creation \nof the state-level Energy Conservation Fund (ECF) to serve as an accessible and effective \nfunding device for energy efficiency projects. The ECA requires the provision of technical and \nfinancial  support  to  consumers  to  change  their  operations  and/or  technology,  and  shift  to \nenergy-efficient systems. Making the energy efficiency program a success in India requires \nfurther emphasis and a decentralized approach, which means state governments will have to \ntake the lead.  \n \n4.  ADB is assisting Madhya Pradesh through its MPPISP, a $620 million multitranche \nfinancing facility. Investments under the MPPISP directly address energy efficiency issues in \ntransmission and distribution, and provide a solid foundation for the sustainable growth of the \nreformed power sector in Madhya Pradesh. The MPPSIP is performing well, and the first four \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2007. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on Multitranche Financing \nFacility to India for the Madhya Pradesh Power Sector Investment Program. Manila (approved on March 2007). \n2 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 8 December 2007. \n ", "2   \ntranches are being implemented. The government of Madhya Pradesh (GOMP) understands \nand acknowledges the importance of energy efficiency and the leadership role attached to it. \nInitial assessments in Madhya Pradesh found that the implementation of energy efficiency \nschemes could save Rs9 billion a year and reduce demand by more than 1,150 MW. for new \ngeneration. Implementing energy efficiency schemes costs an estimated at Rs10 to 25 million \nper MW, compared to Rs40 million per MW to add fresh generation capacity, and an additional \nRs10 to Rs15 million per MW for transmission and distribution. In September 2006, GOMP \napproved a new policy for nonconventional resource development, including directing 5% of the \nRs0.10 per kilowatt-hour levy on electricity sales into energy conservation. GOMP plans to \nutilize the levies collected thus far as part of the seed capital for the ECF. Under the MPPSIP, \nGOMP also requested ADB to allocate a $5 million loan to help capitalize the ECF. This \ncomponent of the MPPSIP was originally scheduled for 2009. Aware of the significance of \nenergy efficiency activities and its leadership role in facilitating them, GOMP requested ADB to \napprove this component in 2008 and provide assistance for the sustainable implementation of \nthe ECF. ADB recruited consultants to assist GOMP in (i) structuring operating modalities and \nprocedures of the ECF, and (ii) developing new financing modalities and instruments to bridge \nthe gap between supply and demand. ADB and GOMP are working closely to formally establish \nthe ECF, determine its management and operational structure, and decide how the funds will be \napplied.3 Consultants\u2019 outputs will be used to provide adequate information in the periodic \nfinancing request for the ECF under ADB\u2019s MPPSIP. \n \n5.  The ECF will have a well-defined and transparent framework for selecting and prioritizing \nenergy efficiency projects. It will not be a closed fund; GOMP plans to initially capitalize the ECF \nby committing proceeds from the ADB loan and contributions from the energy efficiency levy, \nconstructing a relatively low-cost capital base from which returns will be generated. The ECF \nwill present opportunities for private participation, not only as fund manager and financing \nrecipient but also as a financier through ongoing capital injections to accelerate its growth. \nADB\u2019s involvement will create the opportunity for cofinancing from the new Clean Development \nMechanism Fund and other energy efficiency funds. A fund manager for the ECF will be \nselected through a competitive and transparent process. As a result, the ECF will incur startup \nexpenses for things such as remuneration, office space, communication, marketing, travel for \ndue  diligence  of  energy  efficiency  projects,  and  creation  of  a  website  for  information \ndissemination. However, it takes a long time from disbursement to repayment by the client \nbecause the process includes steps such as project approval by the ECF, arrangement of funds \nto be put in by the client, implementation of energy efficiency measures, and energy savings \nrealized by the client. International experience in a few countries in Asia and Europe, and in the \nUnited States, demonstrates that this type of fund received external financial support for their \noperations for the initial years to make them sustainable. Therefore, financial support will be \nessential  to  sustain  the  operations  of  the  ECF  until  repayments  start  coming  in,  which  is \nexpected  to  be  in  5  years.  This  strategy  is  expected  to  help  make  the  ECF  operations \nsustainable from the fifth year onwards; no subsidy would be required after that. In addition, \ndisseminating information, developing partnerships through outreach, and spreading awareness \namong consumers and financiers are necessary to develop a portfolio of energy efficiency \nprojects that can be implemented. Outreach and awareness activities will create an environment \nconducive to the ECF, and will provide visibility to establish credence among the stakeholders.  \n \n                                                 \n3 ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance to India for Project Processing and Capacity Development. Manila (TA 4814-IND, \napproved on 30 June); and ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance to India for Knowledge Management and Capacity \nBuilding. Manila (TA 4780-IND, approved on 17 April). \n  \n ", "  3\n6.  The proposed TA will support the operations of the ECF and provide assistance for its \ninitial stage operational expenditures with the aim of achieving sustainability in the long term. \nThe ECF will be utilized to implement programs through technical and financial assistance to \nconsumer groups, and will realize benefits for all stakeholders involved (e.g., GOMP, power \nsector  companies,  and  consumers.  The  ECF  will  facilitate  financing  of  revenue-generating \nenergy efficiency projects implemented by public sector and private sector entities. The modality \ndeveloped could be replicated in other states of India.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The TA will facilitate the energy efficiency program of Madhya Pradesh by financially \nsupporting initial stage operational activities of the ECF. The TA will enable the ECF to be \nfinancially stable in the first 5 years and self-sustaining thereafter. This initiative will encourage \ncommercial banks and financial institutions to overcome barriers to financing energy efficiency \nprojects.  Through  promotional  activities  such  as  information  dissemination,  outreach,  and \nspreading awareness among the consumers and financiers, the TA will produce a model that \nwill facilitate implementation of energy conservation measures in Madhya Pradesh.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n8.  TA outputs will include (i) supporting the operations of ECF and provide funding for the \ninitial  stage  of  operational  expenditures,  (ii)  facilitating  portfolio  development,  (iii)  assisting \noutreach and awareness, and (iv) financing operational and financial audits. \n \nC.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The project activities can be divided into four categories, with each activity comprising \nspecific outputs. Collectively, these activities will stimulate the creation of a specialized ECF and \nwill provide initial operational support for its sustainability.  \n \n1.  Activity 1: Supporting the Operations of the ECF \n10.  This activity will be implemented in phases. To facilitate the operations of the ECF, a \nfinancial expert will be recruited to develop and finalize (i) articles of association, (ii) deed of \nregistration, and (iii) role of parties note. The TA will also support the relevant management \nexpenditures of the ECF (the terms of reference for the fund manager is in Appendix 4). \nAverage operational expenditures of the ECF are estimated at $100,000 per year, and the TA \nwill finance 100% in the first 2 years, 60% in the third year, 40% in the fourth year, and 20% in \nthe fifth year. The financing amount will be reduced because the fund is expected to earn \nincome from the third year onwards. The TA will also finance due diligence reviews for future \ncapital injections from private equity funds, and will partially cover marketing activities of the \nECF for the first 3 years. \n2.  Activity 2: Facilitate Portfolio Development  \n11.  Under this activity, the TA will finance 10 energy audits in the first 3 years in various \nsectors in Madhya Pradesh. These audits will be used to develop energy saving action plans \nand detailed project reports. These activities will be financed either as grant assistance or on a \ncost-sharing basis initially under this TA (for the first 3 years) and subsequently by the ECF. In \n ", "4   \naddition, the ECF will facilitate energy efficiency demonstration projects and assist GOMP in \ndesigning reward programs and public education activities. Energy auditors will be selected \nfrom a pool of individuals or firms, including energy service companies (depending on the size \nof the project) and must be accredited by the accreditation committee and approved by the \nexecutive committee of the Government\u2019s Bureau of Energy Efficiency. Energy auditors will \nfollow the bureau\u2019s guidelines and terms of references for energy audits. \n \n3.  Activity 3: Assist Outreach and Awareness \n12.  This activity will support awareness programs that will be organized for a diverse group \nof stakeholders whose involvement in energy efficiency is crucial to the success of the ECF. \nThe participants will be owners of commercial buildings, utilities, industries, policy makers, \nenergy auditors, energy service companies, energy efficient equipment manufacturers, and \nbanks  and  financial  institutions  in  Madhya  Pradesh.  These  awareness  programs  will  be \nassessed at the end of each year; and based on this assessment, the following years' program \nwill be modified to improve it. The TA will allocate resources for 3 years to support these \nawareness programs.  \n \n4.  Activity 3: Finance Operational and Financial Audits \n13.  This activity will finance annual financial and operational audits for the first 5 years of the \nECF\u2019s operations. The audits will entail independent reviews and evaluations of the ECF\u2019s \noperational activities and identify opportunities to improve the effectiveness of the ECF\u2019s risk \nmanagement  processes  and  corporate  governance.  The  audit  will  provide  reasonable \nassurance about the accuracy, timeliness, and completeness of financial and regulatory reports \nof the ECF. Audits will be conducted by an independent audit firm engaged by GOMP, and \ncopies of audit reports will be shared with ADB within 6 months from the close of the accounting \nperiod and posted on the ECF web page. \n \nD.  Cost and Financing \n14.   The TA is estimated to cost the equivalent of $2,100,000. ADB will finance $1,700,000 \nfrom the Second Danish Cooperation Fund for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency in \nRural  Areas  administered  by  ADB  on  a  grant  basis.  GOMP  will  finance  the  equivalent  of \n$400,000 in the form of in-kind contributions. Detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 2. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The Energy Department (ED) of GOMP will be the Executing Agency. It will set up a \nproject management unit (PMU) and appoint a senior staff member as the project director to \nimplement activities under the TA. A steering committee will be established and chaired by the \nenergy secretary of GOMP.4 It will have five members, and at least one member will have solid \nexperience in fund management and energy conservation activities. The committee, which will \nmeet twice a year, will be mandated to provide policy oversight for TA activities. ADB will attend \nsteering committee meetings when relevant staff are available. The PMU will develop a detailed \nproject implementation plan in the first month of TA effectiveness. TA evaluation results will be \nmade publicly available on the ADB website. GOMP will provide office space, furniture, and \n                                                 \n4 The steering committee will be constituted at TA inception. \n \n ", "  5\nlogistical and administrative support to the PMU. The TA will be implemented over 60 months, \nfrom November 2008 to November 2013. \n \n16.  GOMP and ADB agreed to partially delegate TA implementation to the ED to improve \neffectiveness.5 ADB has assessed the ED\u2019s procurement capacity (the Procurement Capacity \nSummary Assessment Report is in Supplementary Appendix A). The assessment confirmed \nthat the ED has the capacity to implement a partially delegated TA with assistance from an \nindividual national project implementation consultant (PIC). In the partial delegation context, the \nED through its PMU with assistance from the PIC will be responsible for (i) implementation of \nTA activities; (ii) facilitation of all paperwork for recruitment of consultants (iii) selection and \nengagement of all national consultants except the PIC, financial expert, and long term capacity \ndevelopment expert; and (iv) procurement of equipment, and organization of national workshops \nand an international study tour. All procurements under the TA will comply with the procurement \nplan presented in Appendix 3. ADB will be responsible for overall guidance of the TA, and \nmaking  final  decisions  on  the  procurement  of  equipment,  the  delegated  recruitment  of \nconsultants, and the workshops and study tours. PIC will be hired at inception and will attend \nADB\u2019s procurement seminar immediately. In addition, ADB\u2019s Central Operations Services Office \nwill participate in ADB\u2019s TA inception mission and will conduct necessary trainings for the PIC \nand members of PMU. The project director will oversee day to day implementation of the TA \nactivities. The PIC will coordinate activities of all TA components and assist the PMU with timely \nTA implementation. The PIC will report to ADB and project director simultaneously.  \n \n17.  The  TA  grant  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time). Details of the implementation arrangements \nincluding disbursement arrangements, the extent of ADB oversight of delegated activities and \nprocurement plan are provided in Appendix 3. All consultants will be hired in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The \nfunctional responsibilities for the consultants are described in Appendix 4. The fund manager \nwill be engaged in compliance with Section 2.41 of the same guidelines. Office equipment such \nas computers, printer and photocopy machine and materials to be financed by the TA will be \nprocured  using  the  shopping  method,  and  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). At TA completion, the equipment will be \ntransferred to the government agency using it.  \n \n18.  Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability and transparency, \nimplementation of the TA will adhere to ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date)  \n  \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n19.   The  President  recommends  that  the  Board  approve  ADB  administering  technical \nassistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $1,700,000  to  the  Government  of  India  to  be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Second Danish Cooperation Fund for Renewable Energy and \nEnergy Efficiency in Rural Areas for Facilitating the Operations of the Energy Conservation \nFund \u201cEnergy Smart\u201d in Madhya Pradesh.  \n                                                 \n5 To increase ownership of TA projects and improve sustainability of project benefits, ADB may, in particular \ncircumstances, delegate to a borrower (delegated TA) the responsibility to recruit and supervise TA consultants, \naccording to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The level of delegation would be akin to \u201clow level of EA \n(executing agency) delegation\u201d under ADB. 2008.

For withdrawal of TA grant funds, the ED will \nsubmit to ADB the original withdrawal application, signed by authorized representative, and a \nsummary sheet and copies of supporting documents. To facilitate implementation of the TA \nactivities, the ED will establish and manage an imprest account in a bank acceptable to ADB \nafter the TA becomes effective. The ceiling of the imprest account will be $100,000 and should \nbe claimed based on the detailed estimated expenditure costs. The interest earned on the TA \ngrant in the imprest account can be used to cover the bank charges and any other remittance \nfees. Upon completion of the TA grant and before closing of the imprest account, any unutilized \ninterest should be returned to ADB. If the remittance fees and other bank charges are higher \nthan the amount of interest earned, the amount in excess of interest earned could be charged to \nthe miscellaneous administration expenditures of the TA. To simplify the documentation process, \nthe statement of expenditure will be used to liquidate and replenish the imprest account, and to \nreimburse  eligible  costs  for  any  individual  payment  not  exceeding  $10,000.  Expenditures \nexceeding the statement of expenditure will be reimbursed, replenished, and liquidated based \non the full supporting documentation.

Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, \nADB reserves the right to review and examine, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to activities under the TA. In this \nregard, investigation of government officials, if any, will be requested by ADB to be undertaken \nby  the  Government  of  India.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) will be included in all contracts under the TA. \nIn particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the TA will include provisions \nspecifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of ED and all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the activities \nunder the TA. \n \n6.  Annual progress reports will be prepared for the TA for review by ADB.
