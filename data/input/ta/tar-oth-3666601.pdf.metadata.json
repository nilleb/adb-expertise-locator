In  its  Long-Term  Strategic  Framework  (LTSF)  approved  in  March  2001,  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) committed that, as part of its goal to reduce poverty in Asia, it would \nstrive to institutionalize the measure of \"developmental impact\" as an integral monitoring tool of \nits operations. This is in line with its continuing commitment to enhance its own development \neffectiveness. In this connection, it also committed in the LTSF to the adoption of the sectorwide \napproach as a concrete step towards enhancing its focus on developmental impact.  \n   \n2.  The recent steps taken by ADB to improve performance measurement in its work with \ndeveloping member countries (DMCs) reflects its efforts to actualize the above commitments \nmade in the LTSF. The LTSF states that \"impact must be evaluated systematically and the \nresulting  feedback  used  continually  to  improve  and  enhance  the  effectiveness  of  ADB \noperations.\" ADB achieves and improves the measurement of development results through the \nsector agencies it works with in each DMC.  The development success of these agencies \nbecomes ADB\u2019s success, shared with other external agencies working in the sector. Thus there \nis a need to work on this initiative in both the DMCs and within ADB in tandem.  \n \n3.  In  August  2002,  the  Department  for  International  Development  (DFID)  of  the \nGovernment of the United Kingdom offered ADB technical assistance (TA) financing to help  \nimplement the above initiatives within DMCs and concurrently within ADB. DFID has confirmed \nthat an amount of $300,000 is available to be committed to the objectives and scope of activities \nas outlined below.1 Details are found in the technical assistance framework in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Performance measurement is the process an organization follows to objectively measure \nhow well it is meeting its stated objectives.  It typically involves several phases: (i) articulating \nand agreeing on expected results, (ii) selecting indicators and setting targets, (iii) monitoring \nperformance, and (iv) analyzing the results vis-\u00e0-vis those agreed upon and expected. When \nperformance information is used for reporting to external stakeholders, such reporting is useful \nin competition for funds and can convince stakeholders that an organization's programs produce \nsignificant results and provide \"value for money.\" Development cooperation agencies have \nfaced considerable external pressures to reform their management systems to become more \neffective and results oriented. Public perception that development assistance programs are \nfailing  to  produce  significant  development  results  have  contributed  to  efforts  by  bilateral \nagencies and multilateral development banks (MDBs) to establish results-based performance \nmanagement systems.  \n \n5.  Results-based management (RBM) aims to improve management effectiveness and \naccountability by undertaking the phases described above\u2014 defining realistic expected results, \nmonitoring progress towards their achievement, integrating lessons into management decisions, \nand reporting to external stakeholder audiences. The experience of funding agencies indicates \nthat  RBM  has  moved  operating  focus  from  inputs,  such  as  loan  and  TA  approvals  and \ndisbursements,  to  a  \"results  chain,\"  standardized  at  three  distinct  levels\u2014  inputs  or \nactivities/processes  to  outputs;  objectives  to  outcomes;  and  goals  to  impacts.  This \nrealignment of focus for DMC sector agencies and ADB requires organizational changes such \nas modified procedures and business practices, perspectives, and incentives. Such changes will \nneed to be introduced gradually over time, through an institutional change process.  \n                                                 \n1 The TA was first listed in ADB Business Opportunities on 3 December 2002. ", "2 \n6.  ADB operations in its DMCs focus on specific and selected sectors as agreed upon with \nthe concerned governments. These sectors are identified in the country strategy and program \n(CSP). In some of these sectors ADB is the lead agency; in others it is a supporting agency.  A \nnumber of DMCs already have familiarity with sectorwide (e.g., Viet Nam) and RBM approaches \n(e.g., Philippines, Indonesia), as promoted by other MDBs and bilateral agencies. \n \n7.  ADB has committed in its LTSF to increasingly adopt the sectorwide approach in all of its \noperations in DMCs. This is in line with efforts to more effectively integrate its programs and \nprojects with the DMCs and externally funded ongoing programs. In keeping with the sector \napproach, ADB\u2019s operational focus must therefore become the \"sector results\" that it targets in \neach  sector  in  each  DMC.  The  LTSF  states  that  such  approaches  require  improved  and \nappropriate financial and performance monitoring, in line with measuring development impact. \nThis would also entail the development of new mechanisms and instruments. \n \n8.  Sectorwide results are generally defined in terms of sector outputs (representing short \nduration results within the control of individual projects); outcomes (to be achieved over a 3-to \n5-year  time  horizon,  which  projects  have  a  responsibility  to  manage  towards);  and  sector \nimpacts (representing long-term broader targets achieved through the collective contributions \nof many external and DMC organizations). Sector outputs are tangible products and services \nprovided to the public pertinent to the sector (e.g., delivery of equipment, training courses, \ninfrastructure  components).  Sector  outcomes  reflect  intermediate  institutional  behavioral  or \nservice-level  changes  for  the  client  population.  Sector  impacts  reflect  changes  that  are \nconsequences of these institutional or services changes and contribute to long-term widespread \nimprovement  in  social,  economic,  or  environmental  conditions.  The  success  of  ADB\u2019s \noperations will increasingly be monitored and judged based on the achievement of targeted \nsector outcomes and impacts in each DMC (also linked to the Millennium Development Goals) \nand for the region as a whole.   \n \n9.  The adoption of a sectorwide approach assumes that ADB will broaden its monitoring \nand  reporting  from  individual  project  results  to  sector  outputs,  outcomes,  and  impacts. \nProjects will continue to be monitored, but achievements for all projects within a sector will need \nto be rolled up towards aggregate achievements against sectorwide targets. This will be done \ninitially through the existing Project Performance Monitoring System, but evolution of the PPMS \ninto a broader sector monitoring system is a secondary aim of this TA. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n10.  Key results of the TA are expected to be the following: \n \n(i)  Impacts  \n \n(a)   Selected sector organizations in DMCs adopt sectorwide approaches fully \nincorporating RBM methodology and, more broadly, this influences others \nto adopt this methodology. \n \n(b)   Performance measurement using RBM is gradually adopted by ADB. \n \n(ii)  Outcomes  ", "    3 \n(a)  Increased  understanding  and  gradual  adoption  of  the  sectorwide \napproach using RBM methodology occurs within selected DMCs, sector \ndivisions,  country  teams,  and  resident  missions  (RMs).  This  will  be \nthrough a series of in-house workshops. A nominated officer in each \nselected sector division will coordinate this output. \n \n(b)  A monitoring and reporting system is developed, tested, and in place that \nfacilitates the specification and tracking of results chain achievements \nand their reporting by RMs and sector committees. The activities required \nfor this output will be coordinated by the sector divisions and through the \nRegional and Sustainable Development Department (RSDD).  \n \n(c)   Results will be disseminated and experiences shared from this TA across \nsector  committees,  divisions,  RMs,  DMC  agencies,  and  standardized \nRBM language and usage will be adopted consistent with the experience \nof international development partners within the selected sectors.  This \nwill be coordinated by RSDD. \n \n(iii)  Outputs  \n \n  Sector divisions and RMs in pilot DMCs will work with key government \nsector agencies as well as other external agencies to establish or improve \nsectorwide roadmaps. In the selection, sector/thematic definitions under \nthe  Medium-Term  Development  Framework  will  be  respected.  Overall  \nsupport will be coordinated by the sector divisions and /or a nominated \nofficer in each RM. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA will assist pilot sector agencies in selected DMCs and the ADB RMs in these \nDMCs to develop a plan for sector results. The guiding principle in this activity will be that the \nsector agencies must themselves seek to develop and formalize the sectorwide roadmaps, \ndemonstrating their leadership among funding agencies in this exercise. To assist them in this \ntask, the TA will provide periodic workshops, ongoing guidance, and support. The DMCs will be \nup to five, possibly one in each of the subregions in which ADB operates (South Asia, East and \nCentral Asia, the Mekong, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific). Particular consideration will be \ngiven to those where CSPs are in process. DMC interest in adoption of the sectorwide approach \nwill also be an important criterion for selection. The actual DMCs have not been identified. \nHowever, letters of no objection from each of the selected DMCs will be obtained prior to \ninitiation of the TA there, once the selection process is finalized during implementation.  \n \n12.  The  TA  is  intended  to  be  a  first  step  in  a  series  of  interventions  to  support  the \nintroduction of the sector approach and RBM within DMCs, and by so doing to improve ADB's \ninstitutionalization  of  RBM  within  its  existing  performance  management  system.  This  will \ninevitably be a long-term and phased process. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The total cost of the TA, including travel, workshops, and other miscellaneous costs, is \nestimated at $300,000. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Government of the ", "4 \nUnited Kingdom, Department for International Development. Details of the cost estimates and a \nfinancing plan are shown in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  It is estimated that the TA activities as described above will require the inputs of at least \n12 person-months of international consultants over a period of 18 months. Two consultants are \nrequired, working closely together as a team, with one of them serving as the team leader. The \ntwo consultants will be able to spread their guidance efforts among the five or so DMCs in which \nADB will pilot test this effort. Terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3.  \n \n15.  The TA will be coordinated and implemented by RSDD as the executing agency and \nimplemented from March 2003 to August 2004. It will finance international consultants who have \nproven knowledge and experience in designing and implementing the sectorwide approach and \nRBM. They will be available to provide periodic inputs and guidance to the main units within \nADB that will implement these systems. The consultants will also support pilot sector divisions, \nsector committees, and country teams in ADB (para. 10 [ii] and [iii]). The consultants will be \nengaged as individuals in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000, to be financed on \na grant basis by the Government of the United Kingdom, for Supporting the Sector Approach \nand Results-Based Management in ADB Operations, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard.

Two consultants will be required, each for a period of about 6 months, with one acting as \nteam leader. They will have generally similar terms of reference as described below, with the \nteam leader taking on the additional accountability of leadership, liaison, and reporting. \n \n2.  The  consultants  should  have  proven  knowledge  and  experience  in  results-based \nmanagement  (RBM)  and  the  sector  approach,  and  particularly  in  supporting  their \ninstitutionalization in developing member countries (DMCs). It is preferable for the consultants to \nhave had different sector experience so they can complement each other. \n \n3.  The detailed terms of reference of the consultants are as follows: \n \n(i)  Coordinate the Regional and Sustainable Development Department (RSDD) in \nsupporting  the  resident  missions  (RMs)  in  selected  DMCs  to  work  with  key \ngovernment sector agencies to assist them to develop sector roadmaps as a \nguide for their operations, for Asian Development Bank (ADB) inputs as well as \nfor other external inputs and investments. A nominated officer in each RM and/or \na headquarters sector division will coordinate this output. \n \n(ii)  Coordinate with the Governance and Regional Cooperation Division (RSGR) in \nproviding selected sector divisions (and, as appropriate, country teams) and their \nmission leaders with division-based workshops to facilitate the understanding \nand adoption of the sector approach using RBM methodology in their operations. \nA nominated officer in each sector division will coordinate this output. \n \n(iii)  Work with each pilot sector committee in ADB to choose sector indicators for \nresults. Key sectors from which pilots will be selected are agriculture, natural \nresources (water, forestry), health, education, transport, energy, and finance. \nThis output will be coordinated by the chair of each committee. \n. \n(iv)  Help RSDD develop and implement a monitoring and reporting system that will \nfacilitate the specification and tracking of outcomes and output achievements and \ntheir reporting by RMs, sector divisions, and sector committees.  \n \n(v)  Assist RSDD in disseminating and sharing ongoing results and experiences of \nthis  technical  assistance  across  sector  committees,  divisions,  RMs,  DMC \nagencies, and other external agencies involved.  \n \n "], "metadata": {"Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 5.0.5 (Windows)", "Author": "Aurora Jorge", "ModDate": "D:20030320093107+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20030319135634+08'00'", "Creator": "Acrobat PDFMaker 5.0 for Word"}}
