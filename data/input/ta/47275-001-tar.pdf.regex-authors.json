The Government of Bhutan has requested technical assistance (TA) from the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to support its efforts to  enhance the development of  clean and \nsustainable energy in the country under the Framework for Energy+ Cooperation with Bhutan. \nThe framework was signed by the Government of Bhutan, the Government of Norway, and ADB \non  1  February  2013  in  New  Delhi,  India.1 Energy  +  Cooperation  Partnership  with  Bhutan \nsupports  increased  access  to  sustainable  energy  and  avoided  greenhouse  gas  emissions \nthrough deployment of renewable energy and energy efficiency in Bhutan. \n \n2.  The partnership led by the Government of Norway, follows a three-phased approach of \nreadiness, implementation, and scaling up. The TA will support activities in the initial readiness \nphase of the partnership. ADB fielded missions to Bhutan on 20\u201322 May 2013, 2\u20136 September \n2013,  and  21\u201323  January  2014  to  consult  with  the  Government  of  Bhutan  on  a  joint \nimplementation note, which provided details of the collaboration, and agreed with the executing \nagency and implementing agencies in terms of the impact, outcome, cost estimates, terms of \nreference, implementation arrangements, and key activities of the TA.2 The note, as agreed, is \nin Supplementary Appendix B. The concept paper for the TA was approved by ADB\u2019s Vice-\nPresident, Operations 1 on 13 December 2013.3 The design and monitoring framework of the \nTA is in Appendix 1.   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Bhutan has abundant natural renewable energy resources, dominated by an estimated \n30,000 megawatts (MW) of hydropower potential, of which, only 5% has been developed.4 \nHydropower is the backbone of Bhutan\u2019s economy, generating 99% of the country\u2019s electricity \nsupply, and accounting for 18% of total national revenue and 20% of gross domestic product in \n2013.  The  Government  of  Bhutan  recognizes  hydropower\u2019s  central  role  in  Bhutan\u2019s \ndevelopment and sets out in its Eleventh Five Year Plan 2013-20185 to accelerate expansion of \nhydropower  capacity.  Bhutan\u2019s  power  system  master  plan  has  identified  75  prospective \nhydropower sites for development, but only a few prefeasibility studies have been conducted. \nExpedited prefeasibility studies are needed to secure project funding, particularly from private \ninvestors.   \n \n4.  The high upfront costs of hydropower and other renewable energy development pose a \nmajor challenge for Bhutan. The hydropower sector is dominated by public funds from bilateral \naid  and  development  financial  institutions  such  as  ADB,  which  are  insufficient  to  realize \nBhutan\u2019s  energy  development  objectives.  Private  sector  investment  is  necessary  to  bridge \nfunding gaps, and to this end, the Government of Bhutan has adopted a series of policies during \n2008\u20132013  that  provided  frameworks  and  incentives  for  domestic  and  foreign  private \n                                                \n1 The International Energy and Climate Initiative (Energy+) supports transformational change to achieve universal \naccess to sustainable energy and avoid greenhouse gas emissions in developing countries by scaling-up access to \nrenewable energy sources and increased energy efficiency. The Framework for Energy+ Cooperation with Bhutan \nis in Supplementary Appendix A. The framework formalizes an earlier commitment by the Government of Norway \nmade on 14 October 2012 to provide NKr100 million to Bhutan under the Energy+ Cooperation Partnership. \n2  ADB mission participated in the first meeting of the joint consultation group of Energy+ Cooperation Partnership \nwith Bhutan, which was chaired by the secretary of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Government of Bhutan, on \n6 September 2013. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 16 December 2013.  \n4  Of the 30,000 MW estimate, 23,760 MW considered to be technically and economically feasible. \n5 The Government of Bhutan Gross National Happiness Commission.2013. Eleventh Five Year Plan (2013-2018). \nBhutan. \n ", "2   \ninvestors to participate in the development of medium and large hydropower projects and other \nrenewable energy projects.6 Limited progress on hydropower development has been made so \nfar  due  to  the  absence  of  detailed  regulatory  guidelines  for  implementing  these  policy \nframeworks. The country\u2019s private sector is small and underdeveloped, and foreign private \ninvestment in the hydropower sector is at the \u201cpioneer\u201d stage. The enabling environment must \nbe improved to attract private sector participating in the development of hydropower and other \nclean and sustainable energy.  \n \n5.  The excessive dependence on the single resource of hydropower imperils Bhutan\u2019s \nenergy security. The country\u2019s current hydropower assets are all run-of-the-river plants that \nhave no storage capacity, and rely exclusively on seasonal water flows: generation output can \ndrop to less than 20% of installed capacity during the dry seasons. Enhancing energy security \nrequires diversification of the energy mix,  supplementing hydropower with other renewable \nresources such as wind, solar, and small hydropower; diversification of energy supply will also \nmitigate  hydrological  and  meteorological  risks.  Although  less  cost-effective  than  large \nhydropower,  the  country  will  benefit  from  developing  these  other  renewable  resources  via \nincreased  access  to  electricity  in  remote  areas,  which  will  enhance  energy  security  while \ndelivering  environmental  dividends.  Bhutan\u2019s  Eleventh  Five  Year  Plan  targets  20  MW  of \nalternative renewable energy generation by 2025 which will require elucidation of a robust \nenabling policy environment, of which the highest priorities are (i) formulation of renewable \nenergy7 master plan to identify, assess, and forecast the resources; (ii) formulation of feed-in-\ntariff8 framework; and (iii) preparation of implementation rules and guidelines of the alternative \nrenewable energy policy. \n \n6.  Bhutan is on an actual low emissions development trajectory. Its clean energy resources \nare more than sufficient to meet domestic needs for the foreseeable future, but a pure supply-\nside  approach  will  result  in  sub-optimal  energy  development.  A  strategic  national  energy \nefficiency policy is a near-term priority, as promoting the use of efficient technologies, processes, \nand products throughout the energy supply and consumption chains will eliminate energy and \nother resource waste, accelerating access to energy for all consumers and facilitating growth of \nenergy exports. A research in 2012 identified good potential for savings in energy-intensive \nsectors in the country.9 Lighting was identified as a near-term opportunity for technological leap-\nfrogging:  a pilot program is proposed to replace incandescent bulbs with white light emitting \ndiodes (WLEDs).    \n \n7.  As  a  party  to  the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change,  the \nGovernment of Bhutan is identifying nationally appropriate mitigation actions (NAMAs) which \nare a prospective pipeline of activities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions relative to the \nbusiness-as-usual  scenario,  to  be  implemented  on  a  unilateral  basis.  For  NAMAs  to  be \nsuccessful as a policy instrument, a measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) system \nneeds to be in place to define the business-as-usual scenario and quantify avoided greenhouse \ngas emissions. Well-defined NAMAs, a robust MRV system, and a national energy registry \n                                                \n6  These policies included Sustainable Hydropower Development Policy (2008), Foreign Direct Investment Policy \n(2010) and Alternative Renewable Energy Policy (2013).   \n7  Renewable  energy  here  refers  to  solar  (both  photovoltaic  and  thermal),  wind,  bioenergy,  geothermal,  pico \nhydropower, micro hydropower, mini hydropower and small hydropower up to 25 MW and waste to energy. \n8  A feed-in-tariff (FIT) is a policy mechanism used to encourage deployment of renewable electricity technologies. A \nFIT program typically guarantees that customers who own a FIT-eligible renewable electricity generation facility, \nsuch as a roof-top solar photovoltaic system, will receive a set price from their utility for all of the electricity they \ngenerate and provide to the grid. http://www.eia.gov. \n9 United Nations Development Programme. 2012. Bhutan Energy Efficiency Baseline Study. \n ", "  3 \nsystem are necessary elements to mobilize future climate change financing, including private \nsector investment, and to monetize the benefits of low-emissions development. \n \n8.  In  parallel  with  the  policy  framework,  NAMA  and  MRV  mechanisms,  Bhutan  must \naddress an acute shortage of skilled professionals and specialists at all levels of the public and \nprivate sectors. The country still depends on foreign expertise to fill the gaps. Weak institutional \ncapacity  and  inadequate  human  resources  constrain  the  efficiency  and  responsiveness  of \nenergy services delivery. Human resource development has been given high priority in the \nEleventh Five Year Plan, with institutional capacity building at the top of the energy sector \ndevelopment agenda. The staff of Bhutan government agencies: the Department of Renewable \nEnergy (DRE) and the Department of Hydropower and Power Systems (DHPS) under the \nMinistry of Economic Affairs, and the National Environment Commission (NEC), are in need of \non-the-job training. \n \n9.  The TA is aligned with ADB\u2019s Energy Policy and follows recommendations of an ADB \nevaluation study of ADB\u2019s performance in Bhutan energy sector10 to (i) consider supporting the \ndevelopment of the renewable energy sector by addressing policy, institutional, financial, and \ntechnical barriers; (ii) develop public\u2013private partnership transactions in the hydropower sector; \nand (iii) provide extensive capacity-building assistance. The TA has been included in ADB\u2019s \ncountry operations business plan for Bhutan.11 All the activities to be supported under the TA \nhave been agreed with the Government of Bhutan and the Government of Norway.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact will be enhanced clean and sustainable energy development in Bhutan. The \noutcome will be improved enabling environment for the development of hydropower and other \nrenewable energy resources in the country. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.
