The  Government  of  Solomon  Islands  has  requested  support  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to provide technical assistance (TA) for a diagnostic assessment of \ninterisland transport. The TA was discussed with the Government during a Fact-Finding Mission \nundertaken in  February  2004  to  assess  the capacity  of  the  Ministry  for  Infrastructure  and \nDevelopment, which includes the Department of Aviation, Meteorology, and Communication and \nthe Marine Division; and during the Country Programming Mission undertaken in March 2004. \nThe findings of these missions, in the form of a draft TA paper, have been discussed with the \nGovernment, which has agreed with the goals, purpose, scope, implementation arrangements, \ncost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference. 1 \n \n2.  The goals and objectives of this TA complement the Solomon Islands Country Strategy \nand Program Update 2005\u20132006,2 which aims to achieve rapid, pro-poor, and private sector-led \neconomic growth by (i) providing transport infrastructure and services and (ii) strengthening the \nenabling  environment  for  the  private  sector.  The  TA  supports  the  Government\u2019s  policy \nframework set out in the National Economic Recovery, Reform, and Development Plan, 2003\u2013\n2006 (NERRDP) by complementing a focus on transport for development. The TA framework is \nin Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Solomon Islands is one of the least developed of ADB\u2018s Pacific developing member \ncountries (PDMCs). According to the most recent United Nations human development index and \nhuman poverty index, Solomon Islands ranks below all but one PDMC and t is unlikely to meet \nthe Millennium Development Goals by 2015. Development was significantly set back by several \nyears of severe conflict that ended in 2003.  \n \n4.  The  economy  relies  on  forestry,  fisheries,  and  cocoa  and  copra  production,  all \nconducted in rural areas. Gold mining and oil palm operations, which were suspended because \nof the conflict, may resume in the near term. The vast majority of the population lives on rural \nsubsistence,  and  social  and  economic  disparities  between  the  capital,  Honiara,  and  the \nprovinces  are  wide.  Successive  governments  have  not  succeeded  in  providing  adequate \ninfrastructure  and  services,  especially  in  rural  areas,  nor  in  facilitating  income-generating \nopportunities, with little formal employment available outside Honiara.  \n \n5.  Pro-poor economic growth depends on increased productivity in rural areas. Improved \ninterisland transportation infrastructure and services, and thus reliable access to domestic and \ninternational markets for rural produce and commodities, will be a key strategy for restarting and \nbuilding  rural  economies,  reducing  the  demand  for  migration  to  the  capital  in  search  of \nemployment,  reducing  conflict  between  groups  competing  for  limited  opportunities,  and \naddressing the challenge of restoring basic social services in rural areas. \n \n6.  Interisland  transport  between  Solomon  Islands\u2019  more  than  70  inhabited  islands  is \ncharacterized by long distances, infrequent and unreliable schedules, and unsafe vessels and \naircraft. Outside Honiara, the country has always had a limited infrastructure stock, and the \ndismal state of air and sea services poses considerable barriers to market access and impedes \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 26 June 2004. \n2  Approved by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors on 7 September 2004. ", "2 \nthe growth of rural production. These conditions have had pervasive, negative social effects by \nlimiting rural-urban linkages, labor mobility, and interprovincial trade. \n \n7.  In the aviation sector, Solomon Airlines, a state-owned enterprise, (SOE) is the only \ncarrier providing scheduled domestic services. Most destinations receive only one flight a week \nusing  light  aircraft.  The  airline  operates  no  international  services  directly,  providing  them \ninstead through short-term arrangements with two regional carriers on routes to Australia and \nneighboring PDMCs. International services currently generate a profit despite high contract \ncosts, domestic routes are mostly unprofitable, and there is consequent cross-subsidization \nfrom international to domestic operations.  \n \n8.  In the shipping sector, most provinces own and operate small vessels that were granted \nto them when the national shipping service was disbanded. Since restructuring, many services \nhave been mismanaged, are essentially insolvent, or have ceased operating. The private sector \nservices a few routes between minor destinations, but provincial government lines operate most \nof the major routes, but do not do so in an economic manner. Although some destinations \nreceive one service a week, frequencies of once a month or less are common, and schedules \nare unreliable. Major differences are apparent between cargo and passenger services, with \nmore private sector involvement in cargo.  \n \n9.  While some air and sea routes are potentially commercially viable, others may require \nsome public sector support to provide social services. A National Transport Fund has been \nproposed  to  enable  targeted  subsidies  for  a  franchise  tender  scheme  and  to  provide  a \nminimum level of service on prioritized, uneconomic routes, while at the same time ensuring \nthat as many routes as possible are set up in ways that are economically sustainable without \nGovernment intervention. The design of such a fund will be an output of a related ADB TA (see \nparagraph 28). \n \n10.  The potential for transportation reform is complicated by institutional, regulatory, and \nfinancial problems. The central and provincial governments own about half of all air and sea \noperators, and their dominant positions have crowded out the private sector and raised costs \nthroughout the economy because of inefficiency. Operators in both aviation and shipping are \nself-regulating  by  default  because  of  institutional  weaknesses  and  the  absence  of  senior \nmanagement staff in key positions, and there has been little official oversight in either sector for \nmany years. Financial difficulties brought about by poor governance and political pressure, \ncompounded by regulated fares in the aviation sector, have meant that revenues are generally \ninsufficient to maintain and operate the domestic fleet, leading to severe underinvestment in \nmaintenance and serious safety concerns. \n \n11.  The Government has recognized that reform is urgently required in the sector and has \nset out its policy framework in the NERRDP. Under Key Strategic Area 4 of the NERRDP, \nRevitalizing the Productive Sector and Rebuilding the Supporting Infrastructure, the approach \ntoward transport includes the following:  \n(i)  adopting and implementing a national transport sector strategy; \n(ii)  implementing an interisland shipping project supported by tenders for subsidies; \n(iii)  continuing  implementation  of  marine  and  aviation  infrastructure  projects, \nincluding a national maintenance regime; \n(iv)  improving aviation safety and security; \n(v)  addressing financial responsibilities in air transport;  \n(vi)  finalizing the Shipping Act, the Revised Road Act, and National Transport Fund.  \n ", "    3 \n12.  Implementation  of  this  framework  requires  support.  Under  the  TA,  the  diagnostic \nassessment  will  provide  background  information  and  analytical  support  to  reinforce  the \nNERRDP  and  ADB\u2019s  long-term  transport  sector  strategy  through  strategic  planning  for  (i) \noptimal  use  of  resources  for  rehabilitating  and  maintaining  physical  infrastructure,  (ii) \ncoordinated and sustainable interisland transportation services, and (iii) enhanced private sector \nparticipation in transport operations. By supporting rural economic growth and access to health \nand education, ADB's program will make a positive contribution to moving Solomon Islands \ncloser to meeting the Millennium Development Goal on poverty. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n13.  The goal of the TA is to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of interisland air and \nsea transport services in Solomon Islands, while minimizing the fiscal burden on and exposure \nto risk of public institutions and finances. The purpose is to review the status of interisland \ntransport  services,  determine  constraints  to  their  development,  and  develop  strategies  for \nimproving them. The output will be a diagnostic assessment report that informs a strategy for \nfuture policy dialogue and programming.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The diagnostic assessment report will contain four main components: (i) a review of \nexisting documentation and an analysis of the operational and financial situations of air and sea \ntransport operators; (ii) an analysis of the entities involved in the ownership, planning, and \nregulation  of  interisland  transport  services;  and  (iii)  the  identification  of  opportunities  for \nimproving private sector participation; and (iv) the identification of implementation strategies and \naction plans for reform.  \n \n15.  The baseline analysis will review and analyze existing data and, where necessary, will \ncollect  new  data  on  the  transport  operators\u2019  ownership  and  governance;  their  technical \nperformance, including routes and schedules; their financial performance, including costs and \nrevenues; and the infrastructure and support services available at the provincial and national \nlevels.  \n \n16.  The institutional analysis will review and analyze existing documentation and, where \nnecessary, collect new data on the institutional, policy, legal, and regulatory contexts as they \naffect the planning and operation of transport services in both the aviation and maritime sectors \nand identify constraints to their improvement and expansion. The analysis will pay particular \nattention to factors such as fare and schedule regulation, government policies on investment \nand maintenance, safety oversight, and ownership restrictions that may affect costs and hinder \nefficiency. \n \n17.  The  assessment  of  private  sector  participation  will  determine  existing  and  potential \nopportunities for expanding the role of the private sector in providing transport services. The TA \nwill investigate the feasibility of promoting contestable market solutions that are appropriate to \nthe Solomon Islands\u2019 economy. To complement the institutional analysis, this assessment will \ninclude aspects of the enabling environment that encourage or hinder the private provision of \ntransport services.  \n ", "4 \n18.  The TA will culminate in the development of strategies and action plans for reform at two \nlevels: (i) an overall private sector participation strategy for interisland transport, including policy \nand  regulatory  reforms  that  may  be  desirable  to  facilitate  the  recommendations;  and  (ii) \nindividual  private  sector  participation  plans  for  each  existing  public  sector  operator  in  the \nmaritime and aviation sectors. \n \n19.  Recommendations  and  action  plans  for  sector  reform  will  emphasize  innovative \napproaches toward service provision and improvements to the effective functioning of markets \nby  removing  regulatory  and  infrastructure  constraints.  Alternative  forms  of  private  sector \nprovision of services will be developed. The analyses will focus on minimizing the fiscal burden \non  and  operational  and  commercial  risk  to  the  central  and  provincial  governments,  while \nwherever possible relieving private sector providers of sovereign risk.  \n \n20.  Key activities during the TA will include data review and collection; consultations with \npublic  entities,  operators,  and  users;  analysis,  reporting,  and  a  series  of  policy  dialogue \nexercises with the Government and public services (including through a concluding workshop). \nAviation and maritime issues will be covered separately by dedicated specialists in each sector \nand then synthesized to produce an integrated action plan with detailed recommendations for \neach sector and for national strategic planning of all interisland transport. \n \n21.  In the aviation sector, the TA will analyze both the international and domestic operations \nof Solomon Airlines, because they are provided from within the same organizational structure. \nThe analysis will produce disaggregated results to identify those areas of the airline\u2019s operations \nthat  are  sustainable  and  those  that  require  ongoing  support,  reform,  or  divestment. \nRecommendations will focus on the necessary reforms to improve and sustain domestic and \ninternational air transport. \n \n22.  In the maritime sector, the TA will focus on domestic shipping only, because no Solomon \nIslands\u2019 entities provide international transport services. The analysis will cover both private \nsector  operations  and  public  sector  operations,  where  they  are  likely  to  be  sustained. \nRecommendations will focus on ways to support increased private sector participation in this \nsector. \n \n23.  The TA shall be conducted in full consultation with all relevant stakeholders, including \nMinistry of Infrastructure and Development; Department of Communications, Civil Aviation, and \nMeteorology;  Investment  Corporation  of  Solomon  Islands;  Solomon  Airlines;  Air  Transport \nLicensing  Authority;  Ministry  of  Finance,  National  Reform,  and  Planning;  and  existing  and \npotential  private  sector  operators.  The  results  of  the  TA  will  be  presented  at    a  national \nworkshop with all stakeholders, including users of transport services. \n \n24.  The TA shall incorporate, where appropriate, the findings of relevant existing studies and \nplans, including the EU-funded Solomon Islands Shipping and Marine Sector Study 1999, the \nSolomon Islands Transport Sector Strategy 2002, the AusAID Pacific Regional Transport Study \n2004, the European Union Interisland Shipping Project 2003, the ADB Swimming Against the \nTide Report on the Private Sector in the Pacific 2004, and the ADB private sector assessment \nfor Solomon Islands (expected in early 2005).  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n25.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $420,000 equivalent, of which the foreign \nexchange component is $320,000 and the local currency component is $100,000 equivalent. ", "    5 \nADB will finance all the foreign exchange costs and $30,000 equivalent of the local costs on a \ngrant basis, of which $200,000 will be financed by ADB\u2019s TA funding program and $150,000 by \nthe  Government  of  Australia  through  the  Channel  Financing  Agreement  with  ADB  and \nadministered by ADB. The Government of Solomon Islands will finance $70,000 equivalent of \nthe local currency costs through domestic resources. Appendix 2 presents the cost estimates \nand financing plan. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n26.  The executing agency for the TA will be the Ministry of Infrastructure and Development, \nwhich will be responsible for implementation and coordination across national and provincial \ngovernment agencies. The undersecretary of the Department of Infrastructure will serve as the \nTA coordinator. A transport task force, to be formed in early 2005 and comprising members \nfrom relevant ministries and the private sector, will serve as the project steering committee. \n \n27.   The TA is expected to work closely with the Economic Reform Unit of the Department of \nFinance,  which  has  been  formed  to  oversee,  coordinate,  and  implement  private  sector \nregulatory  reforms,  policy  and  regulations  on  infrastructure  service  provision,  SOE  reform, \nfinancial sector reforms, provincial economic development, statistical collection service reforms, \nand specific sector policy reforms to promote new investments in potential growth areas.  \n \n28.   The TA is also expected to work closely with two other teams that will be conducting \nADB-financed projects. The first is the TA for Institutional Strengthening of the Ministry of \nInfrastructure and Development, which will create the Transport Policy and Planning Unit and \nprepare a National Transport Plan (based in part on the outputs of this diagnostic assessment). \nThe second is the TA for State-Owned Enterprise Reforms and Private Sector Participation, \nwhich will help improve SOE ownership arrangements, accountability, and performance through \nupstream policy advice, corporate governance reforms, and privatization.  \n \n29.  A  total  of  12  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  is  required  from  a \nconsulting firm that will provide four specialists for 3 person-months each: a transport planner \nand economist, an aviation operations specialist, a maritime operations specialist, and a private \nsector specialist. These services will be used concurrently over 3 months starting in February \n2005 and ending in April 2006. Consulting services will be engaged in accordance with ADB's \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants using the quality- and cost-based selection process based \non the submission of simplified technical proposals. The consultants will produce inception, \nmidterm, and final reports addressing all items in the report outline shown in the terms of \nreference. Terms of reference for the consulting services are in Appendix 3.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n30.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $150,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Government of Australia, and (ii) ADB providing the balance \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $200,000 on a grant basis, to the Government of Solomon \nIslands for Diagnostic Assessment of Interisland Transport, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard. \n \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Indicators   \nDesign Summary  and Targets  Monitoring Mechanisms  Assumptions \nGoal       \n  By 2010:   \nIncreased efficiency and \n(cid:131) Improved provincial  (cid:131) National Transport \neffectiveness of \naccessibility via  Plan \ninterisland transport, \nappropriate modes of  (cid:131) Government statistics \ncontributing to economic \ntransport  as compiled in ADB \ngrowth with improved \n(cid:131) Air and sea transport  country reports (2005 \ndistribution of benefits  \nservices operating on  Pacific Islands \nintegrated routes and  Economic Report for \nschedules   baseline statistics) \n(cid:131) Sustained economic  (cid:131) Household income / \ngrowth rate from 2004  expenditure surveys \nbaseline  (cid:131) Country programming \n(cid:131) Improved balance  consultations with \nbetween provincial  communities, private \ngrowth rates  sector, and agencies \n   \nPurpose       \n \n  By 2006:     \nAssess the status of  (cid:131) Findings incorporated  (cid:131) Review of the National  (cid:131) Greater accessibility \ninterisland transport  into the National  Transport Plan  helps rebuild rural \nservices, determine  Transport Plan   (cid:131) Country Strategy and  economies \nconstraints to their  (cid:131) Government  Program Update and  (cid:131) Policy reforms and \ndevelopment, and  implements  sector review missions  incentives can induce \ndevelop strategies for  recommendations for  (cid:131) Tripartite project  private sector \nimproving them  policy reforms  reviews and reports  provision of services \n  (cid:131) Incentives created for  (cid:131) ADB project   \nprivate participation  completion report   \n \n  \nOutputs       \n       \nA diagnostic assessment \nBy 2005:  (cid:131) TA review missions  (cid:131) National Government \nreport with four \n(cid:131) Final report  (cid:131) Tripartite meetings  is willing to push for \ncomponents: (i) analysis \ndocumenting data,  and project reports  policy reform \nof operational and \nanalyses, and  (cid:131) ADB project  (cid:131) Provincial \nfinancial situations, (ii) \nrecommendations  completion report  governments \ninstitutional analysis, (iii) \n(cid:131) Stakeholder    recognize the potential \nidentification of private \nworkshops held on    of the private sector \nsector opportunities, and \nshipping and aviation    (cid:131) National Transport \n(iv) strategies and action \nwith participation by    Fund becomes \nplans for sector reforms \neach province and the  operational in support \n \nprivate sector  of uneconomic routes \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nContinued on next page", "  Appendix 1  7 \nPerformance Indicators   \nDesign Summary  and Targets  Monitoring Mechanisms  Assumptions \nActivities       \n \n1.

Objectives and Scope \n1.  The goal of the TA is to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of interisland air and \nsea transport services in Solomon Islands. The outputs of the TA will include (i) a diagnostic \nassessment report covering the current operational and financial situations of air and sea \ntransport operators; (ii) an institutional analysis of the public sector entities involved in the \nownership, planning, and regulation of interisland transport services; (iii) the identification of \nopportunities  and  potential  models  for  improving  private  sector  participation  in  transport \nservices; and (iv) recommendations, feasibility assessments, and action plans for air and sea \ntransport sector reforms. \n \n2.  A team of four international consultants will be engaged from a firm for 3 person-months \neach to provide technical assistance (TA). The team will consist of a Transport Planner and \nEconomist who shall also serve as Team Leader, an Aviation Operations Specialist, a Maritime \nOperations Specialist, and a Private Sector Specialist.  \n \n3.  The team is expected to work closely with two parallel Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nteams  providing  TA  that  will  begin  their  field  work  at  approximately  the  same  time,  for \nInstitutional Strengthening of the Ministry of Infrastructure and Development, and State-Owned \nEnterprise Reforms and Private Sector Participation Project. The focus for this TA will be \nspecifically on improving the operations of interisland transport, whereas the other teams will \nbe working on broader strategies at the national level.  \n \nB.  Transport Planner and Economist and Team Leader (international, 3 person-months) \n4.  The  consultant  will  design  and  manage  the  detailed  work  program,  conduct  the \ninstitutional analysis, supervise the technical analyses, synthesize the aviation and maritime \ncomponents into an integrated assessment of all interisland transport, and produce the final \nrecommendations and action plans. The terms of reference (TOR) for the consultant include \nthe following tasks: \n(i)  Obtain and review existing and ongoing studies and TA relating to legislation, \npolicies, and regulations in all areas that affect transport planning and service \nprovision. \n(ii)  Collect and review all available data on interisland transport and the economic \nand social conditions determining demand for transport; identify needs for further \nanalysis and data collection; and develop new or updated data as required. \nPrepare  quantitative  and  qualitative  databases  that  document  the  data  as \ncompletely as possible. \n(iii)  Review the current institutional situation, including the role and capacity of public \nsector entities involved in the ownership, planning, and regulation of operators \nand services, and assess existing and projected government policies, strategic \nobjectives, and bilateral and multilateral agreements for air transport based on \navailable documentation and the inputs of the other consultants. \n(iv)  Determine  how  market  structures,  including  those  related  to  public  sector \noperations, finance, management, infrastructure, policies, and regulations, affect \nthe costs and prices of interisland service provision. \n(v)  Review existing recommendations on the preferred options for restructuring the \noperational and institutional environment for interisland transport and update as \n ", "10  Appendix 3 \nrequired.  Disaggregate  the  recommendations  for  the  aviation  and  maritime \nsectors. \n(vi)  Identify legal or regulatory constraints to implementing each restructuring option, \nincluding  existing  commercial  agreements  and  labor  laws.  Recommend \ncontractual and regulatory improvements and performance contracts to ensure \nfair pricing and adequate service standards. \n(vii)  Develop  national  and  provincial  aviation  and  maritime  sector  road  maps  for \nconsideration by stakeholders. Prepare a strategy for engagement with national \nand provincial governments on these issues and an action plan for implementing \nthe preferred options \n(viii)  Prepare an integrated report that combines all aspects of the TOR based on the \ninputs of the other consultants. In particular, focus on strategies and action plans \nfor reform at two levels: an overall strategy for interisland transport and individual \nreform plans for the maritime and aviation sectors. At each level, identify policy \nand regulatory reforms that may be desirable to facilitate the recommendations, \nwith an emphasis on developing private sector participation. \n(ix)  Organize and conduct a concluding workshop to present the results of the TA. \nSolicit feedback on the diagnostic assessment, institutional analysis, and private \nsector assessment. Discuss the recommendations to improve action plans, and \nsolicit  feedback  on  the  feasibility  and  desirability  of  suggested  approaches. \nPrepare and circulate a record of the workshop and incorporate comments in the \nfinal report. \n \nC.  Aviation Operations Specialist (international, 3 person-months) \n5.
