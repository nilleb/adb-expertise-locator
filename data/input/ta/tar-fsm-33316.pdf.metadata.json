The Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) is in a critical transition period, as the \nrenewal of the Compact of Free Association (Compact)1 between the FSM and the United \nStates (US) is being concluded. Under the amended Compact, the Government of the FSM is \nexpected  to  continue  far-reaching  structural  adjustment  policies  and  nationwide  economic \nreform programs to adjust to reduced external funding. The Government has requested the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) to provide technical assistance2 (TA) to support these efforts. \nADB Fact-Finding Missions visited the FSM in August and October 2003. Discussions were held \nwith representatives of the Government and other concerned parties, and understanding was \nsubsequently  reached  on  the  objectives,  scope,  and  implementation  arrangements  of  the \nproposed  TA.  Consultations  on  cofinancing  arrangements  were  also  held  with  the  US \nDepartment of the Interior in January 2003 in Washington, DC and in September 2003 in \nPohnpei. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The FSM economy is dominated by the public sector. The financial transfers under the \nCompact,  a  major  source  of  external  funding,  precipitated  a  substantial  expansion  in  the \neconomy\u2014driven  by  growth  in  public  sector  expenditures.  With  declines  in  the  resource \ntransfers in two major step-downs in Compact funding in FY1992 and FY1997, economic growth \nslowed. The economy suffered a major shock in 1997, as a reduction in financial resources \navailable as a result of the step-down in the Compact funding worked its way through the \nsystem.  \n \n3.  The impact of the Compact grants is evident in the dominance of the public sector and \nthe extent to which aid has permitted total final consumption to exceed the domestic economy\u2019s \nproduction and trade opportunities. The value of imports is six times higher than exports, and \nthe trade deficit was 33% of the gross domestic product in FY2002. Private sector activities are \nmainly in the retailing industry, servicing the public sector. The major challenge for the FSM is to \ntransform itself from a public sector-led economy to a private sector-driven economy. \n \n4.  Economic summits at the national and state levels were organized during the period of \nthe original Compact in advance of the major reduction in Compact transfers. The summit \nprocess paved the way for a public sector reform program (PSRP) that ADB supported through \na program loan3 and associated TAs. As a result of the PSRP, the Government payroll was \nreduced by 30% in nominal terms and the number of public servants cut by 23%. While \nGovernment downsizing was  achieved, insufficient attention was given to streamlining the \nmachinery of government and refocusing government activities within the role and functions that \nonly government can perform in delivering public goods.4 \n \n                                                 \n1  The Compact came into effect in 1986. Under the Compact, the FSM received assistance over 15 years until 2001 \nwith a transition provision for an extension of 2 more years until October 2003. The FSM is currently renegotiating \nthe economic provisions of the Compact with the United States. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 14 February 2003. The TA was included in ADB. 2003. \nFSM Country Strategy and Program Update (2003\u20132005): Federated States of Micronesia as Economic Policy \nReform and Capacity Building, Phase II. The name was modified to better reflect the objectives and scope of the \nTA. \n3  ADB. 1997.

Program Performance Audit Report on the Public Sector Reform Program in the Federated States of \nMicronesia. Manila. ", "2 \n5.  Since 1995, ADB has provided substantial economic management and policy advisory \nTAs. These are two TAs for the economic management policy advisory team,5 and phase I of \nthe Economic Policy Reform and Capacity Building TA.6 The main objectives of the TA projects \nwere to (i) assist the Government in formulating an economic strategy and economic policies \nthat will lead to more rapid and self-sustaining growth, and particularly to address the major \nstructural problems faced by the country; (ii) help monitor policy implementation and provide \nfeedback on the effects of structural adjustment measures; and (iii) provide training to enable \nthe Government, in the medium term, to continue the work of policy analysis without reliance on \nexpatriate staff.  \n \n6.  A  major  accomplishment  of  the  ADB  TAs  on  economic  policy  management  was \nimproved understanding within the Government of sound economic policy formulation and \nmanagement, and effective support for economic policy reforms in response to the major step- \ndowns in US Compact funds. Through graduate and on-the-job training, progress has also been \nmade in developing the capacity of a cadre of local economists with master's degrees in \neconomics. \n \n7.  The Compact negotiations are now near completion, and while the final size of the \npackage is yet to be finalized, the structure and outlines of the new fiscal procedures are \ngenerally well known.  The amended Compact, with a duration of 20 years ending 2023, will be \nadministered mainly through six sector grants, which are for  (i) education, (ii) health care, (iii) \nprivate sector development, (iv) environment, (v) capacity building in the public sector, and (vi) \npublic infrastructure, with priorities in the education and health care sectors. The negotiation \nteams of the FSM and US have proposed an amended Compact based on a $76 million grant to \ncover the six sectors and a $16 million contribution to the trust fund in the first year. The \ncontribution to the trust fund will increase by 0.8 million annually, while the grant for the six \nsectors will be reduced annually by a similar amount. The trust fund will remain untouched until \nFY2023, at which time the fund would be expected to be of a size that would yield an annual \nincome in perpetuity that could replace the annual contributions to the FSM budget from the \nCompact. All payments are inflation-indexed to two thirds of prevailing US inflation. This level of \ncontributions to the FSM budget is a reduction of about 7% from the 2001 Compact grant level, \nand the further step-down every year will entail a prolonged period of adjustment. Therefore, \nthere  is  a  need  for  sound  fiscal  management  to  mitigate  the  immediate  as  well  as  the \nprogressive reduction in the contribution of the Compact to the FSM budget. \n \n8.  For FY2004, more than half of the Compact grant will be allocated to the education and \nhealth sectors. The infrastructure development and public sector capacity building sectors will \naccount for 22% and 15%, respectively. Private sector development and the environment will \nreceive a relatively minor portion of the Compact grant. The public sector capacity building grant \nunder the amended Compact will be used to build effective, accountable, and transparent \nnational and local governments and other public sector institutions. In view of the current \ninstitutional capacity of the governments, the annual public sector capacity-building grant will \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 1995.

", "    3 \nplay a vital role in improving the governments' capacity over the next 20 years, and should be \nused effectively under a comprehensive long-term plan. Currently, about $10 million of the \nGovernment's operating costs for FY2004 were included in the public sector capacity-building \ngrant under the amended Compact. However, the US wants to avoid financing the basic \noperating costs of the Government through this sector grant. To achieve a smooth transition to \nthe amended Compact, the FSM is now required to prepare an FSM-wide transitional 5-year \nplan (Transition Plan) to find alternative funding sources for these operating costs over 5 years.  \n \n9.  The Compact funds will be carefully managed through a Joint Economic Management \nCommittee (JEMCO). The FSM will establish the secretariat for the JEMCO. The JEMCO will, \namong others, review planning and budget documents of the Government, monitor the progress \nof the FSM toward sustainable economic development and budgetary self-reliance, review and \napprove  grant  allocations  and  performance  objectives,  and  review  quarterly  trust  fund \ninvestment reports. The Government, and the JEMCO in particular, will require timely economic \nadvice and assistance in a number of priority tasks, including formulation of a new economic \nstrategy, expenditure cutting, tax reform, and adjustments in the structure and delivery of public \nservices.   \n \n10.  Another key issue is the lack of a comprehensive, longer-term capacity-building strategy \nto respond to the gradual withdrawal of US assistance. The responsibility for human resource \nmanagement at the national level was shifted to the Department of Finance and Administration \n(DFA) as a result of the government restructuring during the PSRP. Since that time, the \nGovernment has not prepared a long-term human resource and institutional capacity building \nplan. Such a plan will be required to utilize effectively the capacity building sector grant fund of \nthe new Compact.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n11.  The long-term goal of the TA is to assist the Government in realizing its \"dream of \neconomic self-sufficiency and security\"7 at the end of the period of the amended Compact, \nthrough achievement of the TA's purpose of timely policy advice and strengthened institutional \ncapacities at both national and state levels. The TA will have two components: (i) Compact \ntransition support, and (ii) preparation of a long-term institutional capacity-building Roadmap \n(the Roadmap).   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n1.  Compact Transition Support \n12.  To achieve a smooth transition in the FSM economy and cope with the anticipated \nreductions in the Compact grant funds, the Government identified immediate needs for aid \nagency support in two major areas: (i) preparation of the Transition Plan, and (ii) strengthening \npublic sector financial control and management. \n \n13.  Transition Plan. The Transition Plan will be based on a careful review of both revenues \nand expenditures of the Government, and will explore the possibility of strengthening revenue-\n                                                 \n7  Urusemal, J. 2003. Inauguration remarks of the President of the FSM. Outside Congress Chamber, Pohnpei, 14 \nJuly. ", "4 \ngenerating efforts as well as reducing Government's expenditures. The TA will aim to produce \n(i) an overall economic transition plan, and (ii) a tax reform plan. The tax reform plan will be an \nessential input to the overall economic transition plan. The overall economic transition plan will \nreview both income and expenditure issues, and propose how to soften the impact of the \ncontraction of the grant funding on the FSM economy. The tax regime and administration will \nalso be carefully reviewed. In this respect, the introduction of a broad-based consumption tax \nwill be explored.   \n \n14.  Strengthening Financial Control and Management. To comply with various new fiscal \nmanagement-related  requirements  under  the  amended  Compact,  the  Government  urgently \nneeds to strengthen its capacity in financial planning, controlling, and reporting. The introduction \nof a uniform financial management information system across five governments in the FSM is \none of the Government's top priorities in its effort to improve financial management. Under the \nTA, the financial work of the governments will undergo a strategic review. \n \n2.  Long-Term Public Sector Capacity Building Roadmap \n15.  The Roadmap will guide the Government in carrying out its institutional capacity building \nduring the amended Compact period (2003\u20132023). The Roadmap will also help ensure efficient \nand effective use of the sector grant for capacity building from the US. The main focus of the \nRoadmap is to improve (i) economic planning, (ii) financial management, (iii) auditing, (iv) law \nenforcement, (v) immigration controls, (vi) the judiciary, and (vii) the compilation and analysis of \nappropriate statistical indicators. Human resource management and staff development issues \nwill be thoroughly reviewed and incorporated in the Roadmap. \n \n16.  To  formulate  the  Roadmap,  the  TA  will  first  establish  the  long-term vision of the \nGovernment of its roles and functions, and its institutional framework and capacity, based on \nconsultations  with  key  stakeholders.  Second,  the  TA  will  conduct  situation  analyses  (or \ndiagnostic reviews) of the national and state governments' institutional framework and capacity. \nThe  analyses  will  cover  the  commitment  and  vision  of  the  leadership  of  the  country, \norganizational  structures  and  functions  of  offices  of  the  governments,  human  resource \nmanagement and staff development policy and system, human resource capacity in terms of \nboth the number and quality of staff, skills mix and gap, top and middle management capability \nand staff morale, staff development opportunities, and quality and efficiency of public services.   \n \n17.  Based on the thorough situation analyses (para. 16), key issues to be tackled will be \nidentified, and short- and medium-term objectives will be defined to achieve the vision set at the \nbeginning of the TA exercise. Detailed initial 3-year action plans will be formulated to achieve \neach objective. Although the action plans will depend on the issues to be identified by the \nthorough  situation  analyses,  the  Roadmap  will  include,  but  will  not  be  limited  to, \nconcrete/detailed staff development plans, a plan to modify, as needed, the human resource \npolicy of the Government, and a plan for restructuring and rationalizing each government. The \naction plans in the Roadmap will enable the Government to implement its capacity building \nefforts in a coordinated manner, and effectively use the public sector capacity building grant of \nthe US Compact, as well as other external assistance.   \n \n18.  A  participatory  approach  will  be  adopted  to  prepare  the  Roadmap.  In  addition  to \ninterviews with concerned parties, a series of workshops will be held at both national and state \nlevels.   \n ", "    5 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n19.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,083,000 equivalent with $759,000 in foreign exchange \nand $324,000 equivalent in local currency (Appendix 2). ADB will provide $500,000 for the TA. \nThe TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The US will cofinance \nthe TA in the amount of $333,000 on a grant basis to be administered by ADB. The Government \nwill contribute $250,000 equivalent to finance the remaining local currency cost. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  DFA will be the executing agency for the TA. The Government will ensure counterpart \nstaff members in the national and state governments to work closely with the consultants for the \ninstitutional  strengthening  and  fiscal  management  efforts.  A  steering  committee  will  be \nestablished  comprising  the  secretaries  of  finance,  economic  affairs,  and  foreign  affairs; \nrepresentatives from the state governments; and other officials as deemed appropriate. The \ncommittee will meet quarterly and be headed by the DFA Secretary. The Government will also \nprovide all available relevant information and will facilitate the collection of socioeconomic and \ntechnical data necessary for preparing the Roadmap.  \n \n21.  ADB will engage the services of international consultants with relevant experience in all \naspects of the specified scope of work. The TA will require 35 person-months of consulting \nservices. Under the Compact transition support component, 13 person-months of international \nindividual consulting services in the areas of fiscal management and financial advice will be \nrecruited. The Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre will work on tax reform-related \nareas in close consultation with these TA consultants. Under the Roadmap component, a \nconsulting firm will be engaged for 22 person-months in the areas of, among others, public \nsector  management,  human  resource  management,  and  training  planning.  A  firm  will  be \nselected based on a simplified technical proposal under the quality- and cost-based selection \nprocess. The consultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants. The detailed terms of reference are in Appendix 3. \n \n22.  The TA will adopt a phased-implementation approach. The Compact transition support \ncomponent will be implemented first. The Roadmap component will be carried out after the first \ncomponent  is  largely  completed,  so  that  the  Roadmap  can  adequately  incorporate  the \nTransition Plan. The TA will be implemented for about 18 months. The first component is \nexpected to begin in February 2004 and be completed by August 2004. The second component \nwill start in September 2004 and will be completed in July 2005. The consultants will adopt a \nparticipatory approach to prepare the outputs. They  will conduct workshops with concerned \nparties  at  both  national  and  state  levels,  to  maximize  the  various  stakeholders'  sense  of \nownership of the Transition Plan and the Roadmap. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $333,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Government of the United States, and (ii) ADB providing the \nbalance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000, on a grant basis, to the Government of the \nFederated  States  of  Micronesia  for  the  Strengthening  of  Public  Sector  Management  and \nAdministration, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \n \n       \n  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nDesign Summary \nIndicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \n     \n       \nGoal       \nAssist the Government  In FY2009, achieve a  Government budget \nin realizing its \"dream  balanced budget without  papers \nof economic self- the amended Compact \nsufficiency and  grant funding for the basic \nsecurity\"  operating costs under the \n  public sector capacity \nbuilding grant \n \nOver 20 years, sufficient \ncapacity building efforts, \nincluding staff training, in \nthe core functions of the \nGovernment, generally in \nline with the Roadmap \n \nPurpose       \n       \n1.
