The Government of the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) has requested the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  to  provide  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  the  preparation  and \nformulation of an Omnibus Infrastructure Development Project (OIDP) that will address the \nspecific and immediate needs for rehabilitation and improvement of the infrastructure in each of \nits four States: Pohnpei, Chuuk, Yap, and Kosrae. 1 The ADB Country Programming Mission, \nduring its 27 May to 6 June 2002 visit to the FSM, conducted a fact-finding exercise and \nreached an understanding with the National Government on a broad framework of the TA. \nAnother ADB mission was fielded from 21 October to 1 November 2002 to sharpen the focus \nand components of the TA. The mission also visited the project areas, carried out an initial \npoverty and social assessment (Appendix 1), and discussed economic and social development \nissues  as  well  as  project-specific  issues  with  the  officials  of  the  national  and  four  state \ngovernments as well as the utility corporations. This report is based on the understanding \nreached with the Government on the goals, purpose, scope, implementation arrangements, \ncosts, financing arrangements, and terms of reference, and the mission\u2019s observations in the \nfield. A TA framework is presented in Appendix 2. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Since the FSM\u2019s independence in 1987, infrastructure development has received special \nemphasis in its economic strategy under the Compact of Free Association (CFA) with the United \nStates  (US)  Government.  Although  much  has  been  accomplished,  infrastructure  remains \ndeficient in many respects. In a recent exercise conducted by the FSM National Government for \npreparation  of  the  Infrastructure  Development  Plan  (IDP),2  the  total  cost  of  the  capital \ninvestment  necessary  over  the  next  15  years  was  estimated  at  nearly  $2  billion.  Recent \ndevelopments have underscored the urgency of measures to address gaps in infrastructure. \nThe recent cholera outbreak in Pohnpei has helped focus Government attention on the fact that \ninadequate  water  and  waste  management  infrastructure  and  facilities  can  threaten  the \nenvironment and impede economic development. \n \n3.  The  National  Government  is  in  the  final  stages  of  negotiating  with  the  US  for  an \nextension of the CFA for another 20 years from FY2003 to FY2023. The indications are that the \nallocation for the infrastructure sector under the proposed CFA extension would be significantly \nbelow the needs of the sector. The National Government is therefore looking at alternate \nsources to supplement the funds from the US for its infrastructure development program. \n \n4.  ADB  has  thus  far  financed  only  one  infrastructure  loan3  in  the  water  supply  and \nsanitation sector, covering three of the four states. This project was closed in October 2002. In \naddition,  ADB  has  financed  two  other  projects  and  one  program,4  all  designed  to  aid  in \nimproving the social infrastructure and help in public sector reform. The conditions and needs \nfor rehabilitation and improvement of physical infrastructure vary from state to state. \n                                                 \n1  This TA was first listed in ADB Business Opportunities on 15 March 2002. \n2  FSM Infrastructure Development Plan for year 2003\u20132017, final report dated May 2002. \n3  ADB. 1996.

Pohnpei State. As in the other states, urban infrastructure has been overloaded owing \nto  the  migration  of  outer  islanders  to  urban  centers  for  education  facilities,  employment \nopportunities, business activities, and other day-to-day needs. The existing Kolonia Sewerage \nSystem, built in the mid-1970s, is currently overloaded and has reached its life expectancy of 25 \nyears. The main urban center of the State of Pohnpei has seen a significant growth in its \npopulation and in business and commercial activities. The system originally operated by the \nthen Department of Public Works of the Pohnpei State Government was transferred to the \nPohnpei Utilities Corporation (PUC) in 1993 for operation, maintenance, and management. No \nexpansion has been undertaken other than the addition of connections to new customers. Due \nto overutilization, PUC has been experiencing overflow at the sewage treatment plant and lift \npump  stations.  This  has  created  serious  environmental  problems  for  the  ever-expanding \nresidential households and adjacent communities, and for the municipal areas of nearby Nett \nand Sokehs Islands. To support the growing need for safe water and to provide it to the people \nof Pohnpei, the Nanpil Water Reservoir needs expansion. The average flow of the Nanpil River \nis approximately 6.0 million gallons per day (mgd), whereas PUC receives only 2.5 mgd on \naverage. It is required to rehabilitate and expand the Nanpil Water Reservoir to meet rising \nwater demand during drought periods. \n \n6.  Chuuk State. A review of infrastructure priorities has revealed that urgent assistance is \nrequired to improve the power sector. There is not enough power generation capacity to meet \nthe existing demand for electricity, and the distribution system is in urgent need of rehabilitation \nand upgrading. Even the water supply of Weno Island, which depends mainly on groundwater \nwells, is being hampered due to intermittent power supply. The shortage of the power supply in \nChuuk is apparently hindering the economic activities of the private sector, including the tourism \nindustry, and removing this bottleneck is an urgent need of Chuuk State. \n \n7.  The state-owned Chuuk Public Utilities Corporation (CPUC), which operates the power \nsystem, is considering the introduction of a trash incinerator power plant rather than diesel \npower plants, partly to address issues of solid waste management. There is no solid waste \nmanagement system in the state, and garbage builds up in public places such as the harbor and \nseafront  without  any  environmental  protective  measures.  Continuation  of  this  practice  will \ncontaminate the lagoon, which is the heart of marine and tourism resources of the state. \n \n8.  CPUC operations in electricity are not yet profitable, for example incurring more than a \n$2 million operating loss in FY2000. CPUC received an annual fuel subsidy from the state \ngovernment of more than $1 million for 1998\u20132000. The revenue collection rate is relatively low \nat 80%, and a significant amount of unpaid bills exists. This is partly due to the fact that many \nelectricity customers are not yet metered. Strengthening the capacity of CPUC in terms of cost \nrecovery is urgently needed to increase its income stream. \n \n9.  Kosrae State. This state consists of a single island and a population of about 8,000, or \nabout 1,100 households. Kosrae Utility Authority is responsible for the management, operation, \nand maintenance of the power system. Kosrae was unable to participate in the previous ADB \ninfrastructure project due to difficulty in legislating the existing ADB requirements. The Fact-\nFinding Mission was informed that the state is now ready to undertake the necessary legislative \nrequirements. The quality of water delivered from the water supply system is not satisfactory, \nmainly due to either a lack or malfunctioning of chlorination and filtration plants. There is a need \nto reorganize the water system on the island and to rehabilitate the water treatment plants and \ndistribution systems in order to supply reliable and safe drinking water. Assistance has also ", "    3 \nbeen requested for wastewater treatment and management of the existing system covering \noxidation pond, small borehole sewer, and septic tank with leach field. \n \n10.  Yap State. With its population of about 12,000, Yap has been the most efficient in \nmanaging infrastructure needs. The power, water, and wastewater systems on the main island \nare currently managed by the Yap State Public Service Corporation. The water supply system in \nthe  main  island  benefited  from  the  recent  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Project  through \nincreased wells and water tanks as well as extension of water pipes. However, some areas \nsuch as Maap and Rumung still need the development of a water supply system to increase \naccess to safe water, since they are currently depending on small-scale village water supply \nsystems that use streams, springs, or seeps as water sources, and sometimes these sources \ndry out with the low level of rainfall. \n \n11.  Institutional Capacity. The main service deliverers of the power, water supply, and \nwastewater management subsectors have been state-owned utility corporations. This approach \nhas generally been considered appropriate to date. However, the institutional capacities of utility \ncorporations vary state by state; some require substantial institutional strengthening in terms of, \namong  others,  technical  and  financial  planning,  facility  maintenance,  billing  and  revenue \ncollection, human resource training and supervision, and strategic decision making. It would be \nworthwhile  to  consider  whether  private  sector  participation  could  benefit  the  institutional \nstrengthening of these corporations. ADB\u2019s sector policy is to continue to support private sector-\nled  initiatives  and  provide  the  necessary  infrastructure  to  support  such  activities.  ADB\u2019s \noperational strategy for the FSM is broadly consistent with this approach. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n12.  The principal objective of the TA is to assist the Government in assessing the feasibility \nof the OIDP for possible ADB financing. The TA will carry out a feasibility study for a project to \nimprove the water supply and sanitation infrastructure mainly in Pohnpei, Kosrae, and Yap \nstates, and the power sector infrastructure in Chuuk state. This exercise will include a study of \nthe deteriorating infrastructure, evaluating the reasons for the high level of deterioration, and \nalternative solutions. The TA will also review the areas covered by the recent infrastructure \nproject and incorporate the lessons learned. The project will consider direct private sector \nparticipation or any other transformation of state utility corporations where possible. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The TA will consist of preparation, formulation, and design of a proposed OIDP for the \nFSM. It will review the list of infrastructure projects identified under the FSM IDP; conduct a \nstudy of the status of the existing infrastructure, along with the impact of the recent water \nproject; and clearly determine the factors causing the significant deterioration. The adequacy of \noperation and maintenance funding and administrative arrangements will also be assessed. As \npart of the TA, the consultants will also prepare an assessment of the likely poverty and social \nimpact of each subproject, including an analysis of the distribution of project effects and poverty \nimpact ratio, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. The \nproject paper will be prepared based on the findings of the study, with balanced attention to the \nurgent infrastructure needs as well as the policy framework and management systems to ensure \nadequate operation and maintenance efforts in each of the four states. \n ", "4 \n14.  In the feasibility studies, the TA will also carry out, among others (i) sector/subsector \nanalyses; (ii) an institutional analysis of executing agencies and implementation agencies, with \na recommendation for possible transformation of state utility corporations; (iii) an environmental \nassessment; (iv) analyses on poverty and social issues and preparation of a summary poverty \nreduction and social strategy (SPRSS) paper, (v) preparation of a participatory strategy; (vi) an \nanalysis of the sustainability of the proposed project, and recommendations and suggestions on \nthe specific policies and strategies to ensure the cost recovery, tariff structure, maintenance of \nthe infrastructure, and sustainability of the infrastructure services; (vii) economic internal rate of \nreturn  and  financial  internal  rate  of  return  analyses  for  each  subproject;  and  (viii) \nrecommendation on project benefit monitoring and evaluation as well as preparation of  baseline \ndata for project benefit monitoring. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $814,000 equivalent, of which $563,000 is the \nforeign  exchange  cost  and  $251,000  equivalent  is  the  local  currency  cost.  The  National \nGovernment has requested ADB to finance $650,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign \nexchange cost and $87,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed by \nADB on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The \nGovernment will finance the balance of the local currency cost equivalent to $164,000. Details \nof the cost estimates and financing plan are provided in Appendix 3. The Government has been \ninformed that provision of this TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 6 months beginning in March 2003 by a \nteam of consultants to be engaged from a firm, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants using the simplified technical proposal and the quality and cost-based selection \nmethod  along  with  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engagement  of  domestic \nconsultants. The TA will require about 20 person-months of international consulting services in \nthe fields of power generation and distribution; water supply and sanitation; economic, financial, \nand  institutional  analysis;  and  environmental  and  social  analysis.  In  addition,  domestic \nconsultants will be engaged to assist the foreign consultant for 5 person-months. The terms of \nreference for the consultants are in Appendix 4. The target completion date of the TA is 15 \nSeptember 2003. \n \n17.  The  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA  will  be  the  Department  of  Transportation, \nCommunications, and Infrastructure (DTCI). To facilitate the TA, a TA steering committee, \nchaired by the secretary of DTCI and comprising senior officials of DTCI and the departments of \nEconomic Affairs, Finance and Administration, Health, and Education will be responsible for \ndirection and policy formulation under the TA, and for ensuring effective liaison, data collation, \nand discussion among the Government, the private sector, and the consultants. The respective \nstate governments will be consulted by the TA steering committee and DTCI. The secretary of \nDTCI will be the focal point for the consultant team and will provide coordination among the \nNational  Government,  state  governments,  agencies,  nongovernment  organizations,  and \nconsultants. DTCI counterpart staff will assist the consultants and become fully familiarized with \nthe TA details. \n \n18.  The consultants will prepare and submit to the National Government, state governments, \nADB, and the Executing Agency the following reports: (i) an inception report confirming the \nteam\u2019s work program; (ii) brief monthly summary reports summarizing inputs and results; (iii) ", "    5 \nreports  on  the  design  and  feasibility  of  infrastructure  subprojects;  and  (iv)  a  final  report \nincorporating  the  comments  of  ADB,  the  National  Government,  and  the  concerned \nimplementation agencies. The TA will be reviewed jointly by ADB, the National Government, \nand the consultants upon presentation of the inception report and at the conclusion of the TA. \nThe final report, incorporating comments of the Government and ADB, will be submitted within 1 \nmonth of receipt of the comments. The consultants will adopt a team approach to carry out their \ntasks and a process approach to incorporate adjustments, if any, as the work proceeds and new \nfindings come out. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $650,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the Federated States of Micronesia for preparing the Omnibus Infrastructure \nDevelopment Project, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nSUMMARY INITIAL POVERTY AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS \nOMNIBUS INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT \n \nA.

Objectives, Scope, and Approach \n1.  The objective of the consulting services is to prepare a feasibility study for the Omnibus \nInfrastructure Development Project in the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) that complies \nwith  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)\u2019s  requirements  for  feasibility  documentation.  The \nconsultants will prepare comprehensive information on all aspects of the proposed project, \nincluding  technical,  financial,  economic,  social,  environmental,  poverty,  and  infrastructure- \nrelated policy matters. The consultants will visit project sites; consult a cross-section of project \nbeneficiaries; identify project implementation capacities and arrangements; estimate project \ncosts and explore cofinancing arrangements; and systematically assess the project and the \nsector\u2014including  developing  a  project  framework,  analyzing  constraints,  opportunities,  and \ndemands, and doing social surveys and an environmental evaluation. \n \n2.  The  consultants  will  carry  out  the  assignment  in  an  inclusive  manner  meaningfully \nconsulting with national and state government officials, state utility corporations, utility users, \nnational planners, affected communities, and involved external agencies. The consultants will \nfocus on identifying and alleviating the immediate constraints that FSM infrastructure poses to \npoverty reduction and socioeconomic development without neglecting the long-term economic \nrationale of the utility services. The consultants will take note of all existing assessments and \nreports available on the sectors. \n \n3.  Although the specific activities and outputs of individual consultant are provided below, \nthe consultants will adopt a team approach to carry out analyses and produce outputs under the \nstrong leadership and coordination role of the team leader. The consultants should also adopt a \nprocess approach to incorporate adjustments in assignments, if required, as the work proceeds \nand new findings come out. \n \nB.
