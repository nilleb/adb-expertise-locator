THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed policy-\nbased loan (PBL) to India for the West Bengal Public Finance Management Reforms Program. \nThe report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Supporting the West Bengal \nPublic Finance Management Reforms Program, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, \nacting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA. \n \n2.  The proposed program builds on past policy-based programs in West Bengal by improving \noperational  efficiencies  and  resource  planning  and  management,  and  taking  a  whole-of-\ngovernment approach to public financial management (PFM) through the integration of state \nfinancial and information systems.1 This will strengthen the delivery of public services and \ngenerate fiscal savings that help West Bengal augment growth-enhancing development financing. \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n3.  West Bengal, a \"general category\" state in the eastern part of India, accounts for 2.7% of \nthe country\u2019s total geographical area.2 It is the fourth most populous state in India with 91.2 million \ninhabitants (7.5% of the national total) as per the 2011 population census. West Bengal\u2019s real \ngross state domestic product (GSDP) increased at a compound annual growth rate of 6.4% from \nfiscal year (FY) 2012 to FY2019. With an estimated GSDP of \u20b911.8 trillion ($161.6 billion) in \nFY2019, it is India\u2019s sixth-largest state in economic size.3 However, it is also among the poorest \nstates with a per capita income of \u20b9109,491 ($1,499.1) in FY2019, compared with the all-India \naverage of \u20b9126,406 ($1,730.6).4 Although the state\u2019s fiscal situation has improved considerably, \nit remains one of India's most indebted states: its debt\u2013GSDP ratio of 33.4% in FY2019 was the \nthird highest among the general category states. \n \n4.  West Bengal Development Finance Programs. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nhas been working with the Government of West Bengal since 2012 on sustainable PFM reforms. \nThe  state\u2019s  fiscally  stressed  situation  in  2012  provided  the  rationale  for  the  West  Bengal \nDevelopment Finance Program, implemented during November 2012\u2013July 2014 and financed by \na  PBL  of  $400.0  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary capital  resources (OCR)  and  a  TA  grant  of \n$0.7 million from ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources).5 The state \ngovernment  achieved  full  compliance  with  all  policy  actions,  and  its  commitment  to  fiscal \nconsolidation was recognized in the program's rating of successful.6 The policy reforms under the \ndevelopment finance program focused on (i) boosting revenue through eGovernance initiatives in \ncommercial  tax  administration,  and  implementing  an  excise  tax  management  system;  (ii) \n \n1  The program is a continuation of the West Bengal Development Finance Program and the Second West Bengal \nDevelopment Finance Program, and is in ADB. 2019.

", "2 \nrationalizing  expenditure  by  improving  expenditure  planning  through  the  medium-term \nexpenditure  framework  (MTEF),  and  adopting  a  subsidy  rationalization  strategy;  and  (iii) \nformulating a debt management strategy. The state government received several awards for its \neGovernance  system  after  the  program.7 The  Second  West  Bengal  Development  Finance \nProgram, financed by a PBL of $300.0 million from ADB\u2019s OCR and a TA grant of $0.5 million \nfrom ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources), was approved in October \n2017. It carried forward the reforms of the first program and promoted the private sector\u2019s \nengagement in service delivery.8 It was completed successfully with the release of the second \ntranche in November 2019. \n \n5.  Achievements of the development finance programs. The state finances improved \nsignificantly since the launch of the first program in 2012. During FY2012\u2013FY2019, the fiscal \ndeficit fell from 3.4% of GSDP to 2.8%; and its quality improved substantially, as reflected in the \nratio of capital outlay to fiscal deficit, which increased from 15.6% to 70.8%.9 In the same period, \nthe state government\u2019s excise revenue, a key target area in both programs, doubled from 0.4% \nof GSDP in FY2012 to 0.9% in FY2019, while its own-tax revenue increased from 4.8% to 5.2% \nof GSDP. As a proportion of GSDP, the expenditure on salaries declined from 5.2% in FY2012 to \n3.5% in FY2019, and the expenditure on pensions fell from 1.9% to 1.4% in the same period, \nsupported partly by the voluntary retirement scheme introduced in transport corporations under \nthe second program. The debt\u2013GSDP ratio decreased from 39.9% in FY2012 to 33.4% in \nFY2019. Therefore, the direction of macroeconomic policies is satisfactory.10 \n \n6.  Structural transformation of state governance to continue. The development and \nimplementation of an integrated financial management system (IFMS) under the two finance \nprograms was instrumental in boosting the state government's  operational efficiencies and \ntransparency.11 To  further  sustain  the  reform  momentum,  and  for  better  integration  and \nmanagement of state finances, the state government is keen to expand its coverage to state-\naided institutions, or \u201cparastatals.\u201d12 The expansion of eGovernance initiatives under the proposed \nprogram  is  expected  to  achieve  that  through  a  whole-of-government  rationalization  and \nsystemization  of  state  financial  management  processes,  particularly  the  administration  of \nfinancing for parastatals. \n \n7.  Whole-of-government perspective lacking in public financial management. West \n \n7  The state government\u2019s Directorate of Commercial Taxes received a national award (FY2015) for excellence in \ngovernment process reengineering. The Finance Department received (i) FY2014 CSI-Nihilent eGovernance awards \nfor (a) information management in commercial tax administration, and (b) a workflow-based file and letter tracking \nsystem; and (ii) the chief minister\u2019s award (2014) for the contribution to citizen-friendly tax reforms and eGovernance. \nThe Excise Department received the 2014 Skotch digital inclusion award for its online tax filing system. The state \ngovernment was acknowledged in the Ministry of Commerce and Industry\u2019s 2014 report on improving the business \nenvironment across India. \n8  ADB. 2017. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Policy-Based Loan \nand Technical Assistance Grant to India for the Second West Bengal Development Finance Program. Manila (Loan \n3563-IND, approved in August 2017). \n9  The fiscal year for a state government in India is the same as that for the national government. \n10 Sector Assessment (Summary): Public Sector Management (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n11 The IFMS is an end-to-end project and the biggest government to government (G2G) and government to citizens \n(G2C) eGovernance initiative by the state government. Under the West Bengal Development Finance Program, four \nIFMS modules were developed that automated disbursements, salary accounts of state government employees, the \nbudget\u2013treasury interface, and revenue receipts. Subsequently, three new modules related to budget estimation, \nmanagement of schemes, and fund flow were added to the IFMS under the Second West Bengal Development \nFinance Program, which further enhanced the efficiency and improvement of resource management.  \n12 Parastatals are state-aided institutions supported partially or wholly by the state government\u2019s budget, such as \neducational institutions, statutory boards and corporations, and local governments (urban and rural local bodies). \n ", "3 \nBengal's parastatals, which are supported through grants-in-aid from the state\u2019s budget, currently \nuse  disparate  and  partly  manual  systems.  This  leads  to  inefficiencies  in  the  assessment, \nprioritization, selection, funding, and monitoring of public investment projects and schemes. Also, \nmultiple bank accounts make it difficult for the state Finance Department to monitor transactions \nunder the respective government schemes and obtain a consolidated view of the balances. This \nresulted in instances where the state Finance Department accessed Ways and Means Advances \n(WMA)\u2014a temporary loan facility provided by the Reserve Bank of India\u2014to meet its cash flow \nrequirements, when in fact unlinked bank accounts had idle funds available. In FY2019, the \ninterest paid on WMA was $2.8 million.13  \n \n8.  Inefficient management of social protection systems. While the IFMS implementation \nunder the past programs enabled timely and accurate salary transactions for state government \nemployees, pension processing is not yet fully automated. The manual maintenance of service \nbook records often delays their updates, increases the risk of erroneous entries, and may result \nin lost or damaged service books. Moreover, since the IFMS is not integrated with the state\u2019s \nOffice of the Principal Accountant General (PAG), documents for pension approvals have to be \nsubmitted  physically.14 Similarly,  the  pension  management  in  parastatals  includes  moving \ndocuments from one office to another for authorization, causing transaction delays and costs. On \naverage, it now takes parastatals about 6 months to process and disburse a pension application. \nAlso, the absence of a reliable system to verify pension entitlements can lead to calculation errors. \nSeveral retirees have taken judicial recourse, which increases the state's court-related costs. \nSimilar issues arise in the manually administered provident fund for parastatals\u2019 employees. \n \n9.  Weak resource planning and management. The second development finance program \nimplemented MTEFs in two state departments to improve strategic resource planning. An MTEF \nrequires efforts to institutionalize it and to build the capacity of government officials for using it.15 \nMoreover, project management and public works accounting is still partly manual, which lowers \nefficiency and increases the risk of resource mismanagement. Also, while the past programs \nbrought considerable progress in tax administration, taxpayer services also need improvements \nto increase business activity and boost tax compliance.16 To ensure the sustainability of PFM \nreforms, including learning from international best practices, the state government wishes to \ninstitutionalize various aspects of PFM, such as the use of MTEFs and gender-responsive \nbudgeting, more thoroughly by providing specialized training to government officers.17 \n \n10.  Inadequate system integration and information management. One of the challenges \nfaced by the state government is the lack of a comprehensive management information system \n(MIS) that would ensure the availability of needs-based information on all its entities, including \nparastatals, and enable evidence-based policymaking and impact analyses of current policies. In \n \n13 Indian Institute of Management. 2017. State Finance of West Bengal. Kolkata. \n14 PAG is an independent body responsible for authorizing pensions and managing state government accounts. \n15 An MTEF is designed to link planning and budgeting. It has a 3\u20135-year outlook with corresponding budgets (actual \nannual budget for the first year and estimated budgets for the next 3\u20135 years). It generally sets out the strategic \npriorities of the country and the intended outcomes over the medium term. ADB. 2002. Linking Planning and \nBudgeting: The Medium-Term Expenditure Framework. The Governance Brief. Issue 2. Manila. \n16 New research shows that an important determinant for a firm is the ease of paying taxes, regardless of the corporate \ntax rate. The introduction of electronic systems for filing and paying taxes has cut tax compliance times globally. \nWorld Bank and PricewaterhouseCoopers. 2020. Paying Taxes 2020 Report. Washington, DC. \n17 The government of West Bengal runs a number of schemes for the development of women relating to education, \neconomic rehabilitation, empowerment, and protection. The state government wants to further strengthen gender \ntargeting in its public financial management under the WBPFMRP, including building capacity in gender-responsive \nbudgeting, and adoption of MTEF in the Department of Women and Child Development and Social Welfare (para. \n28). \n ", "4 \nthe absence of a link between the IFMS and PAG, which has the responsibility to compile the \nstate\u2019s accounts, the state treasury must forward its documents to PAG physically, which delays \nthe finalization and reconciliation of accounts.18 Finally, the absence of an online grievance \nredress mechanism makes the filing and handling of user grievances in important service areas \nsuch as transport and urban local bodies (ULBs) inconvenient and slow. \n \n11.  Lessons. A key lesson from the implementation of the two past ADB programs is that \ninvestment in eGovernance platforms yields high returns through greater operational efficiency, \nless information asymmetry, better monitoring, less leakage, cost savings, and better service \ndelivery.19 Some key lessons from the Independent Evaluation Department\u2019s validation of the first \nprogram's completion report (footnote 6) are that (i) numerous and complex policy actions should \nbe avoided in favor of a clear focus on the core elements of the government\u2019s reform agenda, \n(ii) the government\u2019s sustained commitment and ownership are important, (iii) a gradual approach \nto creating fiscal space is better than a rapid and drastic fiscal adjustment, and (iv) the use of \ninformation technology is effective in enabling reforms.20 \n \nB.  Policy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n \n12.  Program description. The proposed program aims to create fiscal space and improve \npublic service delivery through more operational efficiencies, by (i) extending automation reforms \nto other state departments and parastatals, (ii) upgrading the IFMS and integrating it with the \nfinancial management systems of other agencies, and (iii) building the PFM capacity of state and \nparastatal officers. A stand-alone, two-tranche PBL supported by attached TA is considered to be \nappropriate because (i) this modality allows sequencing and continuity of policy actions over a \nperiod of time in different functional areas and government levels; (ii) structural reforms will \nimprove the efficiency of processes and the use of resources; (iii) the state government is familiar \nwith the modality from its experience with the earlier programs and has shown high commitment \nto reforms in its long engagement with ADB; and (iv) the modality supports the continuity and \nsustainability of reforms achieved under successive programs. \n \n13.  Program  alignment.  The  program  supports  the  Government  of  India\u2019s  overarching \ndevelopment  objective  of  making  public  services  more  accessible  through  interoperable \neGovernment platforms.21 The devastation wrought by Cyclone Amphan in May 2020 and the \nongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) crisis stressed the importance of digital government \noperations and processes for greater fiscal sustainability. The program is fully aligned with ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership strategy, 2018\u20132022 for India\u2014support efficient public sector management \nin state and local bodies, and in sectors through fiscal consolidation; and improve PFM capacity.22 \nIt also directly supports ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, such as operational priority 6: strengthening \ngovernance and institutional capacity (paras. 15\u201317); and operational priority 2: accelerating \nprogress in gender equality (para. 28). \n \n \n18 West Bengal's PAG has the following accounts-related responsibilities: (i) compile monthly civil accounts of the state, \n(ii) prepare annual finance and appropriation accounts, (iii) provide advice on technical issues, (iv) maintain provident \nfund accounts of state government employees, and (v) verify and authorize pension and other retirement benefits to \nstate government employees. \n19 ADB. 2015.

A stand-alone, two-tranche PBL is proposed to ensure that the reforms \nare properly identified and sequenced. The first tranche, to be released upon loan effectiveness, \nincludes actions that build a critical foundation for further reforms. All tranche 1 policy actions \nwere complied with. The second tranche, to be released within 24 months of the first one, will \nbuild on the tranche 1 actions and further reinforce the systems at different levels. \n \n15.  Reform area 1: Improved management of social protection benefits, and grants to \nparastatals. Policy actions under this reform area will focus on: \n(i)  Better management of state government pensions. The program enabled \nonline approval of pensions by the respective authorities, including provisions for \ndigital life certification and features to obtain gender-disaggregated data of state \ngovernment pensioners (tranche 1). The state Finance Department will further \nimprove  the  efficiency  and  transparency  of  the  pension  sanction  system  by \nenabling automatic links with PAG (footnote 14) (tranche 2). \n(ii)  Better management of parastatal employees\u2019 pensions and provident fund \ncontributions. To process pensions efficiently, an automated ePension system \nwas piloted in 65,000 primary and secondary educational institutions with about \n420,000 employees, and in 415 rural local bodies with about 23,000 employees \n(tranche 1). By the time the second tranche is released, the ePension system will \nbe fully rolled out in 1,000 rural and urban local bodies and other autonomous \ninstitutions totaling about 180,000 employees. To manage parastatal employees\u2019 \nprovident fund contributions efficiently, the state government will implement an \nautomated system that also allows it to obtain gender-disaggregated data (tranche \n2). \n(iii)  Better  management  of  grants  to  parastatals.  The  Finance  Department \noperationalized an administrative approval and financial sanction module within \nthe IFMS for automated administrative approval of parastatals\u2019 projects, allocation \nof funds, and monitoring of project-wise fund utilization (tranche 1). To provide in-\nprinciple approval of the detailed reports of projects and schemes of ULBs, the \nIFMS  will  be  integrated  with  the  existing  approval  system  of  ULB  schemes \n(tranche 2).  To  improve  cash  management,  the  state  government  has \noperationalized an initial version of the schematic bank account management \nsystem and registered at least 6,000 bank accounts for efficient public funds \nmanagement (tranche 1). The system will be fully rolled out with additional features \nsuch as ePayment, monitoring of grant disbursements, other transactions, and \nscheme balances within institutional accounts (tranche 2). \n \n16.  Reform  area  2:  Improved  resource  planning,  management,  and  control.  Policy \nactions under this reform area will focus on: \n(i)  Better taxpayer services. The government receipt portal system (GRIPS) of the \nIFMS is an online interface for taxpayers and facilitates the real-time monitoring of \nrevenue collection by the Finance Department. The Finance Department has \nupgraded  the  GRIPS  to  include  a  payment  gateway  and  mobile  application \n(tranche 1), and will add the following additional features for easier user access, \nbetter  user  experience,  and  stronger  compliance:  (a)  \u201cmy  profile\u201d  facility  for \nregistered users, (b) online application for refunds, (c) facility for multiple services \npayment through a single debit transaction, (d) direct payment into the state \ngovernment's treasury deposit account, and (e) capture of gender-disaggregated \ndata for registered users. \n(ii)  Expenditure framework. Continuing the reforms of the earlier programs, the \nFinance Department has approved the introduction of outcome-based budgeting \n ", "6 \nin the Department of Women and Child Development and Social Welfare with a 3-\nyear gender-responsive MTEF linked for the first year with the FY2022 budget \nallocations (tranche 1).23 Accordingly, the department will finalize the MTEF and \nalso  conduct  a  gender-impact  assessment  of  at  least  two  of  its  schemes \n(tranche 2). \n(iii)  Better project management. The state government has developed an IFMS \nmobile application for improved access to the system (tranche 1), and will add a \nmodule for project management and public works accounting to the IFMS with \ngender-disaggregated  data  of  beneficiaries  to  track  the  annual  physical  and \nfinancial progress of projects (tranche 2). \n(iv)  Capacity development. The state government will operationalize a center for \nfiscal policy and public finance to continuously deepen the PFM capacity of state \ngovernment and parastatal officials in important reform areas such as MTEFs and \ngender-responsive budgeting, and sign a memorandum of understanding with at \nleast one PFM institution to provide training (tranche 2). \n \n17.  Reform area 3: Improved information management and service delivery. Policy \nactions under this reform area will focus on: \n(i)  Management information system. The state government will operationalize a \ncomprehensive  MIS  for  informed  decision-making  based  on  needs-based \ninformation, including gender-related information (tranche 2). \n(ii)  Integration  of  systems.  The  state  government  has  integrated  the  payment \nmodule (ePradan) of the IFMS with the Reserve Bank\u2019s upgraded core banking \nsolution (eKuber) for seamless processing of ePayments (tranche 1). It will also \nenable the IFMS's integration with PAG to avoid duplication of processes and \nassociated transaction costs, and delays in account reconciliation.24 \n(iii)  Grievance  redress  systems.  The  second  development  finance  program \nimplemented voluntary retirement schemes in transport corporations to improve \noperational  efficiency.  To  further  ensure  that  transport  services  are  not \ncompromised by the process but rather strengthened, an online grievance redress \nsystem  with  gender-disaggregated  data  will  be  deployed  in  all  transport \ncorporations in the state. Similar systems will be introduced in at least five ULBs \nas well (tranche 2).25 \n \n18.  ADB\u2019s value addition. ADB\u2019s important value addition is the application of lessons and \ninsights from the past two reform programs: (i) specifying the areas that need further support to \nbe sustainable, (ii) extending reforms to parastatals and other state departments, (iii) defining new \nreforms to meet the state government's development objectives, and (iv) strengthening gender-\nrelated aspects. The program has particular relevance because West Bengal is under severe \nfiscal stress after successive economic shocks from COVID-19 and Cyclone Amphan. The \nreforms will give the state government additional fiscal headroom from efficiency gains. ADB\u2019s \nstrengths also lie in its (i) accumulated expertise from conducting similar programs in South Asia, \n(ii) focused dialogue with the governments of West Bengal and India, (iii) high standards in \nprogram design, and (iv) capacity development through the attached TA. \n \n23 This action is a continuation of the MTEF introduction under the two earlier programs. The second program covered \nthe School Education Department and the Department of Health and Family Welfare. It is now proposed to further \ndeepen MTEF adoption and introduce it in the Department of Women and Child Development and Social Welfare. \nThe department is being targeted for its gender and social impact. \n24 eKuber, implemented in 2012, is among the successful central bank-oriented core banking systems in the world. \nAuctions of government securities, updates of WMA positions, and goods and service tax settlements are done \nthrough eKuber. \n25 Once the system is demonstrated in these five ULBs, the state government can roll it out in all 125 ULBs. \n ", "7 \n19.  Development coordination. The Department of Economic Affairs in India's Ministry of \nFinance coordinates the activities of  its development partners to ensure that effective and \nharmonized assistance is built around the country\u2019s development agenda. The ADB program \nteam consulted with the World Bank during program preparations to assess complementary \nreform areas and support coordination.26 The World Bank\u2019s ongoing Institutional Strengthening of \nGram Panchayats Program II (2017\u20132022) includes a series of measures to enhance the voice \nof the people in rural local bodies for public services and complements ADB\u2019s program.27 ADB \nalso held discussions with the International Monetary Fund, which has provided its most recent \nmacroeconomic assessment for India.28 \n \nC.  Impacts of the Reform \n \n20.  The program is aligned with the following impact: better access to public services through \ninteroperable  eGovernment  platforms,  which  is  India's  overarching  development  objective \n(footnote  21).  The  effect  of  the  reform  will  be  greater  operational  efficiency  of  the  state \ngovernment\u2019s PFM system by linking the state Finance Department, parastatals, and independent \nagencies such as PAG and the Reserve Bank.29 Policy actions under reform area 1 will improve \nthe delivery of services for employees and pensioners and reduce officials\u2019 unproductive time;30 \ncut logistics and judicial proceeding costs through automated administrative processing; and \nenable interest savings from more effective cash management with a clear picture of parastatals\u2019 \nschemes and account balances. The rationalized revenue expenditure will contribute to fiscal \nsavings for the state government. Reform area 2 will improve resource allocation, increase tax \nrevenue and business activity through better taxpayer services, and boost the capacity of the \nstate government to implement PFM reform actions. Savings will also materialize from automated \nproject management that reduces time and cost overruns. Reform area 3 will enable informed \nand timely decision-making based on real-time information availability. Finally, grievance redress \nsystems in transport corporations and targeted ULBs will improve service delivery.31 \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n \n21.  The development financing requirement for the state government based on the deficit \nprojections for FY2021\u2013FY2023, excluding the fiscal impact of COVID-19 and Cyclone Amphan, \nis estimated at $17.2 billion.32 The financing requirement will be met entirely from domestic \nsources, including loans from the central government, which will relend the local currency \nproceeds from external financing to the state government.33 Taking into consideration the state\u2019s \n \n26 On 9\u201310 May 2020, ADB joined a public resource management roundtable in Delhi organized by the World Bank at \nthe request of India's Department of Economic Affairs. The event gave the state governments of Andhra Pradesh, \nAssam, Chhattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, Odisha, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, and West Bengal an \nopportunity to discuss their eGovernance initiatives for mutual learning. \n27 The projects by major development partners in West Bengal are listed in Development Coordination (accessible from \nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n28 International Monetary Fund Assessment Letter (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n29 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n30 The average pension processing time in parastatals will be reduced from 180 days to 45 days. \n31 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n32 The financing requirement is expected to be higher than this estimate because of the fiscal impact of COVID-19 and \nCyclone Amphan. However, the state government has submitted its fiscal impact estimates of COVID-19 and the \ncyclone to the Government of India for additional fiscal support. Since the matter is under consideration, those \nestimates have not been shared with ADB, and are not included. \n33 In India\u2019s federal structure, state governments enjoy strong autonomy with a clear demarcation or concurrency of \nsubjects between the central and state governments. However, the central government determines the borrowing \nlimit for states that have outstanding loans from the central government (external financing to state governments is \nrouted through the Government of India). The annual borrowing limit for states is 3% of GSDP, which the central \n \n ", "8 \n(i) development financing requirements, and (ii) conformity with the Government of India\u2019s policy \non counterpart financing requirements, ADB will provide a PBL of $50.0 million as budget support \nto the state government. The policy reforms under the program are expected to augment \nrevenues and improve operational efficiencies, leading to reduced current expenditure and more \nfiscal space. The program will thus contribute to financial sustainability while also sustainably \nincreasing development spending.34 \n \n22.  The government has requested a regular loan of $50.0 million from ADB\u2019s OCR to help \nfinance the program. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years; an \nannual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other terms and \nconditions set forth in the draft loan and program agreements. Based on the straight-line method, \nthe average maturity is 9.25 years, and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. The loan \nwill be disbursed in two equal tranches (para. 24). \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n23.  The borrower will be India, which will relend the local currency generated from the \nproceeds of the loan to the state, in accordance with the government\u2019s arrangement for transfer \nof external assistance. The governments of India and West Bengal fully concur with the state-\nlevel PBL, and the state government has sufficient policy autonomy and ability to address sector \nissues. The proceeds of the PBL will be withdrawn in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \n24.  As in the previous ADB programs, the state Finance Department will be the executing \nagency. It will constitute a steering committee chaired by the Principal Secretary and including \nthe secretaries of the implementing agencies to provide overall program oversight, and resolve \ninterdepartmental issues during implementation.35 A senior official (joint secretary or above) from \nthe Finance Department will manage the program as the program director in coordination with the \neGovernance group of the Finance Department. The program director and other key officials from \nthe Finance Department will also be on the steering committee. ADB will monitor program \nimplementation through periodic progress reports and regular missions. Procurement, advance \ncontracting, and retroactive financing are not expected. The first tranche of $25 million will be \nreleased upon loan effectiveness, expected in November 2020. The second tranche of $25 million \nwill be released upon full compliance with the second-tranche actions, expected by 31 December \n2022. \n \nIII.  ATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n25.  Attached transaction TA\u2014India: Supporting the West Bengal Public Finance Management \nReforms Program\u2014will assist the implementation of the program, including capacity building, and \nhelp ensure compliance with the second-tranche actions. The TA outputs are: (i) actions to \nupgrade, integrate, and expand the IFMS monitored; (ii) gender-responsive MTEF developed; \nand (iii) social and gender aspects strengthened.36 The TA is estimated to cost $400,000, of which \n \ngovernment relaxed to 5% in FY2021 because of COVID-19. Intergovernmental Fiscal Arrangements in India \n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n34 Program Impact Summary (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n35 The Additional Chief Secretary headed the Finance Department until recently and was expected to chair the steering \ncommittee as also noted in the Development Policy Letter. With a change in his portfolio, Principal Secretary, Finance \nwill now head the department and the steering committee.  The implementing agencies are the departments of \nPanchayat and Rural Development, Urban Development, Transport, Women and Child Development and Social \nWelfare, and School Education. \n36 Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \n$350,000 will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-\nother sources). The state government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart \nstaff remuneration, office accommodation and supplies, local transport, other logistical support, \nand other in-kind contributions. ADB will administer the TA. The Public Management, Financial \nSector, and Trade Division of its South Asia Department will select, supervise, and evaluate the \nconsultants. The implementation arrangements for the TA will be aligned with those of the \nprogram. The state Finance Department will carry out the overall supervision and coordination. A \ntotal of 17 person-months of consulting services (national) will be required intermittently.37 \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n26.  Governance. The PFM framework of the state government is strong. All departments \nfollow the PFM-related national and state laws, and all employees abide by the conditions of \nethics as prescribed in the state government's published gazettes.38 The regular statutory external \naudit is done by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (Supreme Audit \nInstitution of India). Budgeting is linked to fiscal targets, as specified under the West Bengal Fiscal \nResponsibility and Budget Management Act, 2010, which aims to ensure prudence in fiscal \nmanagement and fiscal stability. Specific to the program, since this is a PBL, ADB financing will \nbe provided as budget support. There is no transfer of resources to the implementing agencies \nspecifically for policy actions, other than through the usual annual budgetary approval procedures. \nNo risk associated with fund flow arises. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) \nwas explained to and discussed with the state government's Finance Department. ADB\u2019s website \nlink for reporting fraud and corruption was shared with the department, which will inform the \nimplementing agencies accordingly. \n \n27.  Poverty and social. The program\u2019s emphasis on stronger operational efficiencies and \npublic  service  delivery  will  positively  impact  efforts  to  lower  poverty  and  promote  social \ndevelopment.39 \n \n28.  Gender. The program is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. It aims to upgrade \nthe PFM systems to obtain gender-disaggregated data on (i) pensioners of the state government \nand parastatals, (ii) provident fund accounts, (iii) registered users of GRIPS, (iv) beneficiaries of \nstate government projects, (v) grievances submitted to transport corporations and five targeted \nULBs, and (vi) information retrieved through the MIS. In addition, at least one course will train \ngovernment officials in gender-responsive budgeting; and the capacity for expenditure targeting \nwill be strengthened in the Department of Women and Child Development and Social Welfare \nthrough a gender-responsive MTEF (para. 16). The department will conduct gender impact \nassessments for at least two schemes of the department as part of the MTEF preparation. \n \n29.  Safeguards. Given the nature of the program, all three safeguard categories (environment, \ninvoluntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples) are C.40 The program\u2019s policy actions will not \ngenerate any environmental, involuntary resettlement, or indigenous people impacts. \n \n37 A consulting firm will be engaged using the quality- and cost-based selection method with a standard quality\u2013cost \nratio of 90:10. All consultants will be recruited in line with ADB's Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time \nto time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). All disbursements \nunder the TA will follow ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n38 The relevant regulations include (i) General Financial Rules (2017), (ii) West Bengal Financial Rules (1979), (iii) West \nBengal Treasury Rules (2005), (iv) Delegation of Financial Power Rules (1977), and (v) The West Bengal Service \nRules (1971).
