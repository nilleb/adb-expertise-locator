During the 2002 Country Programming Mission, the Government of Indonesia agreed to \ninclude the Local Grids Development Project in the pipeline of projects for assistance in 2004 \nfrom the Asian Development Bank (ADB). Accordingly, ADB fielded the Fact-Finding Mission for \nthe technical assistance (TA) for preparing the Local Grids Development Project on 26-29 May \n2003.1 An understanding was reached with the  Government regarding the goals, purpose, \nscope, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference of \nthe TA. A preliminary framework is in Appendix 1, and a summary initial poverty and social \nassessment in Appendix 2.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  In the wake of the 1997 East Asian financial crisis, the incidence of poverty in Indonesia \ndramatically surged from 14.7% in early 1997 to a peak of 23.5% in early 1999. However, the \ndata for 2001 and 2002 show a return to the mid-1990s level of around 15%. The Government\u2019s \npoverty reduction strategy focuses on economic recovery, sustained growth, social service \ndelivery, and regional development. Establishing reliable and efficient power generation and \nsupply facilities in the rural areas is an integral part of this strategy. \n \n3.  Power  supply  is  essential  for  economic  growth  and  job  creation.  A  recent  paper3 \nassessed  the  correlation  coefficient  between  electricity  consumption  per  capita  and  gross \ndomestic  product  per  capita.  Indonesia  has  a  correlation  coefficient  of  0.986,  which \ndemonstrates a very close relationship between these two variables. Between 1985 and 2000, \nthe average annual energy consumption of industrial customers increased more than three \ntimes (241,520 kilowatt-hours [kWh] to 767,150 kWh); that of commercial consumers more than \ndoubled  (4,156  kWh  to  9,950  kWh);  and  that  of  residential  consumers  remained  almost \nunchanged from 911 kWh to 1,140 kWh. As the Indonesian economy underwent significant \nstructural  changes,  electricity  consumption  by  industrial  and  commercial  sectors  was  an \nimportant driver of rapid economic growth as the manufacturing sector expanded rapidly during \nthe period, providing 9.2% of employment in 1985 and 12.9% in 2000.4  \n \n4.  Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN) has over 31 million customers, of which more than 20 \nmillion are in rural areas. The electrification ratio at the household level is now about 54%. The \nextension of power supply to rural areas has also sharply increased. While only 17% of the \nvillages were electrified in 1985, by 2002 PLN provided power to nearly 80%. \n \n5.  Within the framework of the ADB-supported Power Sector Restructuring Program,5 PLN \nis  being  reorganized  in  accordance  with  the  Government  policy  of  decentralizing  decision \nmaking to regencies (districts and municipalities) and provinces, so as to establish competitive \npower generation in Java-Bali under Electricity Law 20/2002. The strategic business units \n                                                 \n1  The Mission comprised A. Terway, principal energy specialist and project team leader (later replaced as team \nleader by Y. Zhai, senior energy specialist); A. Hirano, energy specialist (financial analyst); and X. Jia, project \neconomist (poverty reduction).  \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 7 April 2003.  \n3  Ferguson, R., W. Wilkinson, and R. Hill. 2000.

The PLN head office will retain control of finances through review and integration of \nSBU business plans and budget.  Reorganization will strengthen PLN\u2019s efficiency and capacity \nin  meeting  the  challenges  of  achieving  90%  electrification  by  2020,  as  required  in  the \nGovernment-issued Blueprint for the Development of National Electricity Industry, 2003-2020.  \n \n6.  In accordance with Electricity Law 20/2002, the blueprint also sets the following targets: \n(i) retail electricity tariff will be raised to an economic tariff level by 2005 and then maintained \nusing an automatic tariff adjustment mechanism; (ii) business will be conducted in an efficient, \neffective, transparent, and accountable manner, for which competition for generation will be \nstarted on trial in Batam in 2004, and a similar market will be started in Java-Madura-Bali in \n2007; (iii) with a change in the role of the Government, the Directorate General for Electricity \nand Energy Utilization (DGEEU) will be the Electricity Authority responsible for policy making, \nbusiness, and technical regulation; and the Electricity Market Supervisory Board (EMSB) which \nwas established in September 2003, will acquire the capacity for economic regulation and \noversight of the unbundled entities; and (iv) the provincial and regional governments6 will have a \ngreater role in managing power sector issues (new investments in capacity additions and \nsupply, electricity tariffs, conservation, and efficiency improvement), regulating the regional  \nutilities, and preparing of the draft regional electricity master plans. \n \n7.  ADB has been active in supporting energy sector development in Indonesia, with 30 \nprojects with a combined value of $3.44 billion and 37 TA grants totaling over $13.6 million. The \nOperation Evaluation Department study (footnote 3) indicates that ADB-financed power sector \nprojects have produced a range of downstream socioeconomic benefits at the local level. The \nimproved power supply increased employment opportunities, stimulated development of new \nbusiness, and brought easier access to information and technology. The use of electricity also \nadded convenience to people\u2019s daily life, including that of the poor. Improved lighting extends \nthe  hours  for  work,  education,  and  recreation.  Outdoor  illumination  livens  up  community \nactivities and contributes to improved social security. The improved quality of electricity supply \nto existing consumers in project areas benefited all user groups. The secured power supply also \nfacilitated the development of new industrial estates and tourism industries in some regions. \n \n8.  The TA is in line with ADB\u2019s energy policy, which requires that projects should be \nprepared such that the poor account for a major share of beneficiaries\u2014suitable projects are \nlocated in poor areas or provinces and include specific poverty-related components such as \nrural electrification. An ADB policy note on infrastructure and poverty reduction7 reviewed recent \nliterature and econometric results for the link between physical infrastructure and poverty \nreduction. The note concludes that rural infrastructure investments (mainly in roads, irrigation, \nand  power  supply)  can  reduce  poverty  by  producing  direct  and  indirect  effects.  Rural \ninfrastructure investments employ the poor and contribute to improved wages and hence to \npeople\u2019s economic welfare. This is the direct income distribution effect. The indirect growth \neffect is that, higher productivity and expanded employment lead to higher economic growth, \nwhich improves the poor's well-being. Another working paper examined growth and poverty \nreduction in Indonesia8 and argued that electricity and communication-information variables \n                                                 \n6 There are over 400 district-level governments in Indonesia. \n7  Ali, I., and E.

", "  3\n(public telephone, television, post office, and news agents, all of which are supported by power \nsupply) are a proxy for access to technology, which helps to increase the productivity and \nincomes of the poor. Villages in areas where these services are absent may simply not have an \nimportant  avenue  to  raising  productivity.  Studies  suggest  that  improving  access  to  these \nservices by 10% raises the poor's income by roughly 2%. Therefore, the ADB- supported \ninvestment in rural electrification is an efficacious way to promote poverty reduction. \n \n9.  The TA is also in line with the Country Strategy and Program (CSP) (2003-2005), \napproved in October 2002, which proposes to improve the effectiveness of ADB assistance by \ngiving it a sharper geographic focus. ADB's previous operations were often dispersed across the \narchipelago, based on sector-specific needs as identified by government ministries, which did \nnot allow projects to be grouped in similar locations across sectors. After analyzing each \nprovince's  poverty,  the  financial  resources  of  local  governments,  and  human  capital \ndevelopment, the CSP recommended a multisector assistance focus in provinces with medium \nto high poverty and a low financial resource base. The area covering multisector focus includes \nall of Java (except Jakarta), Lampung, South Sumatra, North Sumatra, West Nusa Tenggara, \nand Southeast Sulawesi. The TA will prepare an electrification project with a sharper geographic \nfocus to produce a higher overall poverty-reduction impact in those provinces.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n10.  The TA will help the Government prepare the Project, which will increase the quantity \nand quality of rural electricity supply, thus assuring greater economic activities in rural regions, \nreducing poverty, and providing a better quality of life. The TA will provide the outputs that will \nhelp in seeking financing from ADB: technical review of the components; economic, financial, \nenvironmental,  and  social  analysis;  procurement  and  implementation  plans;  and  bidding \ndocuments  for  all  contract  packages.  On-the-job  training  will  be  conducted  during \nimplementation of the TA to ensure technology transfer and strengthening of PLN and DGEEU.   \n \n11.  The TA will prepare the Local Grids Development Project for rural electrification with the \nfollowing components: (i) expanding the power distribution network; (ii) implementing mini \nhydropower plants in Southeast Sulawesi; (iii) preparing  new mini hydropower schemes; and \n(iv) project implementation consulting services. In view of the intended geographical focus and \nthe rural bias of the design of the Project, it is likely to be classified as a poverty intervention. \nThe Project will also promote the use of renewable energy sources in rural areas. The output \nwill include medium (20-kilovolt [kV]) and low-voltage (380 volt [V]) power distribution networks \nincluding connections to new consumers; and implementation of grid-based power generation \nprojects that are economically sustainable and use renewable energy sources. No less than \n50% of the Project\u2019s estimated cost will be for implementing schemes located in provinces \nidentified for multisector focus (para. 9).  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  PLN and DGEEU will use internal resources for initial technical project preparation, i.e., \nfor all candidate project components, and they will (i) carry out engineering, and technical \njustification, and prioritization; (ii) select project components on financial, economic, and social \ncriteria and geographical focus as defined in the CSP; (iii) prepare project cost estimates and \nfinancing plan; (iv) develop procurement plans (package list, bidding documents, schedule for ", "4    \ninviting bids, bid evaluation, and finalizing contracts); and (v) obtain statutory clearances and \napprovals, as applicable, for environmental and social matters.  \n \n13.  Consulting  services  will  review  the  work  done  by  PLN  and  DGEEU  and  assist  in \nfinalizing documentation for ADB approval. They will also prepare (i) the economic justification \nfor the Project, including a least-cost analysis, determination of economic and financial internal \nrates of returns, risk analysis, and develop monitorable indicators that permit the measurement \nof project benefits accruing to the poor; (ii) the poverty impact analysis of the project including a \ndistribution analysis of the project benefits, and calculation of poverty impact ratios; (iii) land \nacquisition and resettlement plans (LARPs), where applicable, using the compensation policy \nframework and procedural guidelines agreed upon by PLN and ADB and forming part of the \n2002  Power  Transmission  Improvement  Sector  Project;  and  (iv)  the  initial  environmental \nexamination  (IEE)  or  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA),  as  warranted  under  ADB's \nenvironmental guidelines, and the summary.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,253,000 equivalent, comprising $800,000 in \nforeign exchange and $453,000 equivalent in local currency. Financing for the TA will comprise  \n$593,000 from ADB\u2019s TA funding program and cofinancing of $400,000 on a grant basis to be \nadministered by ADB from the Government of the United Kingdom, to finance the entire foreign \nexchange  cost  and  $193,000  equivalent  of  the  local  currency  cost.  The  Government  of \nIndonesia will provide the remaining $260,000 equivalent of the local currency costs. The \ndetailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  DGEEU will be the Executing Agency (EA) and PLN will be the Implementing Agency for \nthe TA. A steering committee will be established to guide and monitor the project preparatory \nactivities; it will be chaired by DGEEU, and PLN will be the steering committee secretariat, with \nmembers from different ministries and agencies, including the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of \nCooperatives, Ministry of State-Owned Enterprises, National Development Planning Agency, \nand concerned provincial/regional government representatives. The Government and PLN will \nsupervise the consulting services. In addition to carrying out the preparatory tasks (para. 11), \nPLN will (i) provide office space, and full-time professional counterparts to work closely with the \nconsultants; and (ii) coordinate with the various ministries, other external sources, and other \nstakeholders to collect necessary information and data. \n \n16.  The TA will be implemented over 8 months, starting in February 2004 and ending in \nSeptember 2004. A consulting firm will be selected in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic \nconsultants.  The  simplified  technical  proposal  and  the  quality-  and-cost-based  selection \nprocedures will be used in selecting the consulting firm. The TA will require 21 person-months of \ninternational and 25 person-months of domestic consulting services. The terms of reference for \nthe consultants are in Appendix 4. The consultants will prepare inception, first interim, interim, \ndraft final, and final reports, due 2 weeks, 2 months, 5 months, 7 months, and 8 months, \nrespectively, after the services start. Tripartite meetings will be held in PLN for the presentation \nand review of the initial, interim, and draft final reports. \n \n17.  PLN will carry out its preparatory work related to the various Project components from \nAugust 2003 to March 2004. ", "  5\n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Government of the United Kingdom, and (ii) ADB providing the \nbalance not exceeding the equivalent of $593,000 on a grant basis to the Government of \nIndonesia for Preparing the Local Grids Development Project and hereby reports this action to \nthe Board.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nSector identified as a national  Yes  Sector identified as a national  Yes  \npriority in country poverty analysis?  priority in country poverty  \n  partnership agreement? \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Indonesia: \n \nThe poverty partnership agreement signed in April 2001 states that, in the medium term, poverty reduction \ndevelopment priorities will focus on three major areas of intervention: good growth, human resource development, \nand good governance.  \n \nA reliable supply of power is important for attracting commercial and industrial activities, which in turn enable the poor \nto diversify income sources from increased employment opportunities. The ability of regional governments to promote \neconomic development and improve living standards, therefore, depends on the availability of adequate power \nsupply. Electricity and communication information variables (public telephone, television, post office and news \nagents, all of which are supported by power supply) are considered as proxy for access to technology, which matter \nto the incomes of the poor. Villages in areas where these services are absent may simply not have an important \nmeans of raising productivity of their assets. Studies suggest that improving access to these services by 10% raises \nthe poor's income by roughly 2%.1 \n \nThe Local Grids Development Project will increase access to electricity and contribute to economic development and \npoverty reduction. The geographical focus of the intervention will be provinces with medium to high poverty incidence.  \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis        Proposed Classification: PI \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nPoverty analysis will make use of existing surveys and national, provincial, and regency data combined with \nconsultations in the field. The analysis will assess direct impact and indirect impacts, and macroeconomic effects. To \nthe extent possible, the study will include gender as a specific socioeconomic group across poverty status. When a \npoor household is newly connected to the power grid, it will intuitively start paying for electricity consumption, which \nmay reduce household savings if the household was doing without the service, e.g., using kerosene lamps that \nprovide less light and for fewer hours; not listening to radio or television broadcast. However, greater access to \ntechnology will gradually increase productivity. The technical assistance will examine and combine consumer base \ndata and poverty data for specific target regencies to establish a poverty profile of consumers as primary \nbeneficiaries, and their consumption patterns.  \n \nThe analysis will include a review of the impact of development aspects, interlinking the projected effects of increased \npower supply with sector growth patterns, employment, and poverty in the target regencies. It will use data from the \nCentral Bureau of Statistics (BPS). The analysis will assess the impacts of planned development on absorption of \nunskilled versus skilled labor and implications for income and income source diversification. The analysis will \nparticularly assess effects in production activities, the ability of the poor to benefit from job opportunities, and \nsustainability of poverty reduction effects. To the extent possible, the analysis will discern the effects of employment \nopportunities on gender. The analysis will also assess the causality between power demand and economic growth, \nsector growth patterns, and the effects on poverty reduction. \n \nThe poverty analysis will identify monitorable proxy indicators for assessing the poverty impact of the proposed \nProject. \n \n \n1  Balisacan A., E.
