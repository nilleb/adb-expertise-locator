The Government of the Republic of Uzbekistan has requested Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) technical assistance (TA) to formulate a railway development project covering priority \nlines of the network (see map). The Fact-Finding Mission visited Uzbekistan in October 2002, \nand held discussions with representatives of the Government and Uzbekistan Railways (UTY). \nAn understanding was reached with the Government and UTY on the TA objectives, scope, \nterms of reference, cost estimates and financing plan, and implementation arrangements. This \npaper is based on the understanding reached with the Government and UTY and the Mission's \nobservations. The TA is included in ADB\u2019s 2002 Country Assistance Plan.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Uzbekistan has an area of nearly 450,000 square kilometers and a population of 22.5 \nmillion. The country is a major agricultural producer and is rich in natural resources. Despite its \npotential, Uzbekistan's per capita gross domestic product of $451 in 2001 was among the \nlowest in the region. Landlocked, Uzbekistan is highly dependent on land transport to support its \nexternal trade and domestic economy. Much of the country's land transport infrastructure needs \nrehabilitation. Major inefficiencies are caused by rigid price controls and distorted incentive \nstructures. \n \n3.  Uzbekistan\u2019s geopolitical location makes the railway a key link in the strategic Eurasian \nCorridor linking Asia and Europe.2 The railway system, about 4,200 route-kilometers (km) of \ntrack,  including  700  route-km  of  double  lines  and  350  route-km  of  electrified  lines,  is \nGovernment owned and operated by UTY.3 As the dominant transportation mode, the railway \ncarries over 75% of all freight volume in ton-km, with road transport accounting for the rest. \nRailway passenger traffic accounts for over 20% of passenger-km, and roads and civil aviation \naccount for the remaining passenger services.  \n \n4.  Since independence in 1991, inadequate capital investment, combined with the shortage \nof materials and spare parts from Russia, Ukraine, and the Eastern European countries, and \nscarcity  of  foreign  exchange,  have  exacerbated  the  problem  of  maintaining  the  railway \ninfrastructure. A sizable portion of the track that carries the bulk of national and international \ntraffic has outlived its economic life and is overdue for replacement. As the country progresses \nto a market-oriented economy, the demand for traffic is changing, with increasing emphasis on \nservice quality and cost-effectiveness. Competition from other transport modes, particularly road \ntransport,  is  increasing.  As  a  result,  the  railway  subsector  faces  serious  problems  in  the \ncondition of physical infrastructure, its operations, and its ability to operate successfully in a free \nmarket environment. ADB has reviewed the needs of the railway subsector through 3 TA \nprojects.4 \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in September 2002. \n2  The corridor is supported by the European Union (EU) through the Transport Corridor for Europe-Caucasus-Asia \ninitiative under the EU's Technical Assistance for the Commonwealth of Independent States Programme, which \nprovides grant finance to support  the transformation into market economies and democratic societies. \n3  Uzbekistan Railways (UTY) is a state-owned joint stock company, responsible for planning, construction, operation, \nand maintenance of the railway system. \n4  ADB. 1997.

Technical Assistance to \nUzbekistan for Furthering Policy Reform in the Railway Sector. Manila ", "2  \n5.  In response to the Government\u2019s request for assistance to the railway subsector, ADB \nprovided Loans 1631-UZB and 1773-UZB for two railway projects,5 which are rehabilitating 661 \nkm of railway track. Under Loan 1631-UZB, the procurement of most of the materials and \nequipment through international tenders is complete and rehabilitation of track is progressing \nwith some delay. Under Loan 1773-UZB, procurement of materials and equipment through \ninternational  tenders  is  progressing  although  with  some  delay.  Rehabilitation  of  track  is \nexpected to start in 2003 (after the supply of materials and equipment) and will take about 3 \nyears to complete. The progress of implementation of the two projects is being monitored by \nUTY\u2019s Project Implementation Unit (PIU). Other than some delays in implementation, no major \nproblems are envisaged in implementation of these projects. \n \n6.  ADB's ongoing railway projects include time-bound reform frameworks that were agreed \nto by ADB, the Government, and UTY. The Railway Reforms Commission, established in June \n1997, is coordinating reform implementation.  An asset-downsizing plan has been prepared, and \neight  freight  stations  have  been  closed.  The  staff  reduction  plan  is  also  progressing \nsatisfactorily, and the number of staff was reduced to 40,9876 by the end of 2001, much lower \nthan the target of 43,998. The plan to separate educational facilities has been implemented, and \n30 secondary schools and 91 kindergartens have been handed over to local authorities. Under \nseparation of nonrailway ancillary units and their privatization, 26 units have been separated \nfrom UTY. The Small Business Fund was set up to help separated staff establish small business \nventures.  UTY also achieved a working ratio below 0.95 for 2001 and 0.88 as of July 2002.  \n \n7.  Under TA 3529-UZB,7 crucial institutional support is being provided to prepare the \nnecessary regulatory framework, help UTY become a commercial operation, improve UTY\u2019s \nfinancial management and marketing capabilities, and prepare measures to mitigate the social \nimpacts of staff reduction and other organizational reforms. The consultants submitted their \ninterim report in August 2002, and the draft final report will be submitted in December 2002. \n \n8.  Since  1996,  ADB  has  been  leading  the  coordination  of  external  assistance  and \ndevelopment of reforms in the railway subsector. Besides ADB, Japan (through the Japan Bank \nfor International Cooperation [JBIC]), the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development \n(EBRD), and the European Union (EU) are assisting the railway subsector. JBIC has financed \nthe Railway Passenger Transportation Improvement Project, under which repair facilities for \npassenger coaches have been set up and new coaches supplied to UTY. Under a second JBIC \nproject, repair facilities for electric locomotives are being set up.  Through the EU-funded \nTransport  Corridor  for  Europe-Caucasus-Asia  program,  a  study  of  railway  electrification, \ntelecommunications, and management information systems has been undertaken. EBRD is \nfinancing  procurement  of  electric  locomotives  and  the  modernization  of  diesel  electric \nlocomotives. ADB worked with EBRD on developing a comprehensive reform framework and \ncapital investment strategy for UTY. Cooperation between EBRD and ADB will continue during \nproject preparation.  \n \n9.  Efficient operation of UTY is critical to economic growth in landlocked Uzbekistan and is \nimportant for regional cooperation. Consistent with ADB's sectoral strategy for Uzbekistan, ADB \nwill support the Government's ongoing economic transition to a market-based economy  by \nhelping the railway subsector develop an efficient policy and regulatory framework and by \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 1998.

This support is envisioned through the TA \nand the ensuing railway development project. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n10.  The TA objective is to prepare a project that helps the Government improve sector \nefficiency to meet the transportation needs of the domestic economy and international traffic. \nThe TA will continue ADB\u2019s support for sound sector policy to facilitate market-based transport \nmanagement and operations. A TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA scope includes the preparation of a feasibility study for a railway development \nproject suitable for external financing. The feasibility study will be prepared in consultation with \nthe Government, UTY, and other concerned agencies, and will consider all studies done by \nADB, other multilateral agencies, and bilateral agencies. The study will cover all relevant areas, \nincluding technical, financial, and economic viability; environmental impacts; institutional and \norganizational aspects; and social and poverty impacts in accordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines. \nThe TA will support enterprise reforms and restructuring of UTY and assess the opportunities to \npromote good governance in operations, and procedures to enhance UTY\u2019s efficiency and help \nUTY achieve financial self-sufficiency in a market environment. Outline terms of reference for \nthe consultants are in Appendix 2. The TA will conduct a prescreening of the following options \nfor inclusion in the subsequent project: \n \n(i)  rehabilitation of track from Samarkand to Karshi (139 km); \n \n(ii)  rehabilitation of track from Navoi to Uchkuduk (182 km, excluding 97 km already \nrehabilitated by UTY); \n \n(iii)  introduction of modern traffic and rolling stock control systems on UTY; and \n \n(iv)  improvements  to  the  UTY  lines  comprising  part  of  the  Khavast-Bekhabad-\nKhanebadam-Fergana route to complement a proposed rehabilitation project with \nTajikistan Railways, in accordance with ADB\u2019s active involvement in encouraging \nregional cooperation among the Central Asian republics. \n \n12.  The results of the prescreening of the above options will be presented in the interim \nreport.  Following  agreement  by  UTY,  the  Government,  and  ADB  on  the  results  of  the \nprescreening of the above options, a full feasibility study will be prepared for the preferred \noption.  As  requested  by  the  Government,  the  consultants  will  also  conduct  preliminary \nscreening of any other railway investment options such as a railway line from Angren to Pap for \nseparate future examination.  \n \n13.  Since rehabilitation will be carried out on the existing railway track, no adverse land \nacquisition,  resettlement,  or  adverse  environmental  impacts  are  expected.  However,  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines, an initial environmental examination (IEE) will be carried out, \nas will a poverty and social analysis (PSA). The summary initial PSA is in Appendix 3. \n ", "4  \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n14.  The total TA cost is estimated to be $860,000 equivalent comprising a foreign exchange \ncost of $510,000 and a local currency cost of $350,000 equivalent. Accordingly, a TA grant of \n$600,000 will be proposed for ADB financing to cover the entire foreign exchange cost of \n$510,000 and $90,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed by ADB on \na grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The remaining \nlocal cost of $260,000 equivalent will  be provided by the Government, mainly in kind. The \ndetails of the cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 4. The Government was \nadvised that approval of the TA and its implementation does not commit ADB to finance any \nensuing project.8 \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA  will  be  UTY.  A  project  coordinating  committee \ncomprising  representatives  of  the  concerned  railway  departments  and  headed  by  the \nchairperson of UTY or his/her representative will be set up to monitor the TA\u2019s progress and \nresolve any issues. UTY will also appoint a project coordinator to coordinate and supervise the \nwork of the consultants on a day-to-day basis and serve as a liaison between the consultants \nand other concerned agencies. \n \n16.  The TA will require about 35 person-months of consulting services, consisting of 15 \nperson-months of international consultants and 20 person-months of domestic consultants. \nInternational  consultants  will  have  expertise  in  the  following  fields:  transport  economics, \nfinancial analysis, railway engineering and operations, information technology, environmental \nanalysis, poverty and social analysis, transport policy analysis, and institutional restructuring. \nDomestic  consultants  will  have  expertise  in  railway  engineering  and  operations,  financial \nanalysis, information technology, and environmental and social analysis. A team of consultants \nfrom an international consulting firm, in association with domestic consultants, will be selected \nand engaged by ADB using the quality- and cost-based selection method in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Office equipment will be procured in accordance \nwith arrangements acceptable to ADB. \n \n17.  To  facilitate  the  work  of  the  consultants  and  ensure  that  UTY  benefits  from  their \nexperience, the consultants will work closely with counterpart staff from UTY, who will be \ntechnical  experts  in  railway  engineering  and  operations,  transport  economics,  information \ntechnology, and financial analysis. Other technical staff will be made available by UTY to assist \nin fieldwork. The Government has agreed that the counterpart staff will be provided in a timely \nmanner. \n \n18.  TA implementation is expected to start in May 2003 and to be completed in about 7 \nmonths, by November 2003. An inception report will be submitted by the consultants within one \nmonth of starting work. The consultant will submit brief progress reports monthly and interact \nregularly with staff of UTY and any other interested government organizations concerning TA \ntechniques, analysis, and findings. The consultants will submit an IEE report together with a \nsummary IEE report. After ADB's review, the consultants will be advised if the IEE and summary \nIEE are to be finalized on the basis of comments by ADB and the Government. The consultants \nwill submit an initial social assessment report to ADB and the Government for review. An interim \n                                                 \n8  A loan in the amount of $50 million in 2004 for the Third Railway Development Project has been included in the \nUzbekistan Country Strategy and Program Update (2003\u20132005). ", "  5\nreport  containing  the  results  of  the  prescreening  will  be  submitted  within  3  months  of \ncommencement of the TA. A draft final report, comprising a full feasibility study and including a \ndetailed PSA, will be submitted within 5 months. The draft final report will be reviewed by UTY, \nthe Government, and ADB, and comments will be finalized at a final tripartite meeting (among \nUTY, the Government, consultants, and ADB) to be held in Tashkent. The consultants will \nsubmit a final report within 3 weeks of receipt of comments from UTY and ADB. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Uzbekistan for preparing the  Third Railway Development Project, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board.

Assess  the  need  for  consultant  input  for  implementation \nsupervision. Prepare a project implementation schedule taking into consideration \nall major activities, logistics of procurement, and seasonal aspects. \n(x)  Prepare a project framework that logically outlines the goals, objectives, outputs, \nand activities/inputs under the Project; integrates the economic and social effects \nof the Project; ensures transparency and accountability; promotes the efficient \nuse of resources; and provides the basis for monitoring and evaluation. \n(xi)  Review and describe the work done in the railway subsector by other multilateral \nand bilateral agencies, including the European Bank for Reconstruction and \nDevelopment, World Bank, European Union, Japan, and others, giving in brief \nthe nature of intervention, assistance provided, and the current status. The future \nprogram of work should be indicated to the extent known. \n(xii)  Review and update the asset downsizing program and arrangements for disposal \nof assets, and make recommendations. \n(xiii)  Review the status of private sector participation in the railway subsector, and \nrecommend areas and measures to enhance such involvement. \n \n2.  Economic  \n \n4.  The consultants will have the following tasks: \n  \n(i)  Provide  a  clear  statement  of  the  project  rationale  and  a  rationale  for  ADB \ninvolvement. Assess relevance of the Project to the overall development strategy \nand the sectoral strategy, priority of the Project for public investment; and the \npolicy environment for the Project covering taxes, exchange rates, interest rates, \netc. \n(ii)  Review  the  demand  for  railway  transport  and  prepare  a  traffic  forecast  by \ncommodity. Identify other means of meeting transport demand and assess their \nimpact on the traffic forecast. Estimate economic costs of rail and road transport \nto  determine  the  allocation  of  freight  (by  commodity)  and  passenger  traffic \nbetween these modes. These estimates should take into account work done \nunder other ADB projects in the region. Shipment times for each of the modes \nshould  be  estimated  and  used  to  estimate  diverted  traffic.  The  impact  on \ntransport  costs  of  anticipated  road  projects  should  also  be  included.  After \nconsidering the above and taking into account experience under other ADB- \nfinanced railway projects, prepare a realistic traffic forecast for the rehabilitation \nperiod and subsequent 20 years. The traffic forecast should be broken down by \ncommodity, loaded and unloaded, in tons and ton-km moved, and number of \npassengers and passenger-km, split for through (or transit) traffic and traffic with \norigin or destination in Uzbekistan. The traffic forecast should include estimated \nfrequency of freight and passenger trains on the sections of the track to be \nrehabilitated. \n(iii)  Conduct a prescreening analysis of the options listed in para. 1, based on \nexpected traffic, costs, and other data, and recommend the option likely to be \nmost feasible. The results will be presented in the interim report. \n(iv)  For  the  option  selected  by  ADB,  the  Government,  and  UTY  after  the \nprescreening exercise, identify all project costs and benefits, comparing with- and \nwithout-project situations. Undertake  an economic evaluation of the Project by \nfollowing  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects.  Estimate  the \neconomic internal rate of return  on the basis of nonincremental and incremental \neconomic benefits (including environmental and socioeconomic benefits) and \neconomic costs (including economic capital, operating, and maintenance costs), \nin constant prices using with- and without-project situations. The analysis should ", "  Appendix 2  9\nbe carried out by using a consistent set of national economic parameters and \nstandard conversion factors/shadow exchange rate factors, identifying the traded \nand nontraded components of both economic costs and benefits, and applying \nthe standard conversion factor to nontraded items (or a shadow exchange rate \nfactor to the traded items). The economic analysis should examine, but not \nnecessarily be limited to, the following categories of benefits: savings from track \nmaintenance and repair that would be incurred without the Project, inventory cost \nsavings, operating cost savings, avoided rolling stock investment, and avoided \ndiverted  traffic.  Benefits  arising  from  through  (or  transit)  traffic  should  be \ncalculated separately. Separate estimates should be made of economic benefits \nfrom improvement of operating efficiency (due to policy reforms, restructuring, \nand improved governance). The estimated measures of productivity, for example, \nimprovement of wagon cycle productivity, underlying the benefits from operating \nefficiency improvements, and others should be provided. \n(v)  Undertake sensitivity and risk analysis to assess the effects on the Project due to \nadverse  changes  in  key  variables  such  as  project  cost,  decrease  in  traffic, \nimplementation delay and exchange rate fluctuations, taken separately and in \ncombination, in accordance with ADB's Handbook for Integrating Risk Analysis in \nEconomic Analysis of Projects. The results of the sensitivity analysis should be \nsummarized in a sensitivity indicator and in a switching value. In case the Project \nis sensitive to the value of a key variable that is uncertain, mitigating measures \nshould be recommended. \n(vi)  Assess the development impact of the Project focusing on generated economic \nactivities. The estimate of development should be accompanied by appropriate \nmonitoring and evaluation indicators. \n(vii)  Estimate the expected distribution of net project benefits among users of freight \nand  passenger  transport,  the  Government  and  UTY,  labor,  the  economy  in \ngeneral, lenders, and any other beneficiaries. Estimate the number of poor and \nextremely  poor  people  who  will  benefit  from  the  Project  by  calculating  the \nproject's poverty impact ratio based on results of the distribution analysis and in \naccordance with ADB's Handbook for Integrating Poverty Impact Assessment in \nthe Economic Analysis of Projects. \n \n3.  Financial  \n \n5.  The consultant will have the following tasks:  \n \n(i)  Undertake  a  financial  evaluation  of  the  Project  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  the  Financial  Governance  and  Management  of  Investment \nProjects  Financed  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank.  Estimate  the  financial \ninternal rate of return  based on the difference between the without- and with-\nproject values of assets at the end of the economic life of the Project. Compare \nthe FIRR with the EIRR and explain the reasons for differences, if any. \n(ii)  Identify risk factors and test the sensitivity of the Project to them, and propose \nmitigating measures.
