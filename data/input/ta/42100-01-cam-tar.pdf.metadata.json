INTRODUCTION \n1.      The proposed capacity development technical assistance (TA) aims to support the \ndevelopment of Cambodia\u2019s oil and gas industry to allow the government its due share of sector \nrevenue while also fostering greater private sector participation in upstream and downstream \noperations. Prior support from the Asian Development Bank to the regulator, the Cambodian \nNational Petroleum Authority (CNPA), has helped to fund an analysis of CNPA's strategic \nfunctions,  a  road  map  for  development  of  upstream  and  downstream  petroleum  sector \noperations in the country and an outline for a combined upstream and downstream petroleum \nlaw. A second ADB TA1 provided on-the-job training and advice to the CNPA counterpart staff \nand advice and guidance on IT needs and the installation of the basic IT equipment and \nservices during 2008-2010. All indications are that the first set of production permits will be \nissued  in  the  near  term  and  oil  revenues  are  to  begin  accruing  to  the  government.  The \ngovernment has requested ADB\u2019s continued assistance to help strengthen the CNPA\u2019s staff \ncapacity.  Specifically,  the  TA  will:  (i)  help  prepare  key  technical  analyses  and  operating \nguidelines, such as contractual and fiscal regimes and inter-agency coordination protocols, and \nundertake  workforce  planning  assessments,  (ii)  develop  and  roll  out  an  institutional \ndevelopment plan, and (iii) provide training, along with such knowledge resources as computer \nequipment and software, to enhance staff skills and managerial capacity. In addition, the TA \nprogram  will  serve  as  a  coordinating  platform2 and  help  integrate  the  delivery  of  future \nassistance  to  the  sector  planned  by  several  development  partners  and  the  private  sector. \nInstitutional  strengthening  of the  CNPA  is  well-aligned  with  the  priorities  of  ADB\u2019s  country \noperations  business  plan  (COBP)3,  which  are  to  promote  good  governance,  institutional \ncapacity  building,  and  the  development  of  an  enabling  environment  for  private  sector \ndevelopment. The TA will expand the CNPA\u2019s capacity to manage exploration and potential \nproduction of onshore oil and gas around the Tonle Sap region, which is a geographical focus of \nthe COBP. The impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, and costs of the TA \nwere finalized based on discussions with the CNPA.  The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Development  of  extractive  industries  in  Cambodia  can  generate  valuable  foreign \nexchange for the country and help lift millions of the country\u2019s citizens out of poverty. For this to \nhappen, however, it is crucial that the sector be developed in line with principles of good \ngovernance, regulatory certainty, increased operational effectiveness, and prudent fiscal and \nfinancial management. Putting these elements in place will also encourage greater private \nsector participation. Development of certain natural resources in Cambodia has not necessarily \nalways translated into long-term economic benefits for the citizens of the country.  \n \n \n                                                \n1 ADB, 2008. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Cambodia for Institutional Strengthening of Cambodian \nNational Petroleum Authority, Manila (TA 4901-CAM).  \n2 Under the previous TA, ADB had established a development partners group comprising The World Bank, Australian \nAgency for International Development, Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation, the United Nations \nDevelopment Programme (UNDP), among others. This group was to facilitate better coordination and has been \nmeeting regularly to review progress under the various donor-support programs relating to the petroleum sector \nand also review progress being made by CNPA on the milestones established under its roadmap. It is expected \nthat the TA will utilize this development partners group as a key instrument for continued coordination.  \n3  ADB, 2009. Country Operations Business Plan (2009-2012), Manila.  \n ", "2            \n \n3.  Growing interest in the country\u2019s nascent oil and gas sector provides a new opportunity \nto develop an extractive industry that can contribute to broad-based economic development. If \nproperly managed by a national public agency, the industry could attract more private sector \ninvestment and diversify the country\u2019s energy supplies. Most importantly, this would create a \nnew  revenue  stream  for  the  government\u2014through  royalties,  corporate  income  taxes,  and \nproduction sharing\u2014and these revenues could then be invested in health, education, social \nservices for the country\u2019s people and the development of the agriculture and infrastructure \nsectors.  \n \n4.  Cambodia\u2019s geology and exploration indicate petroleum accumulations, although drilling \ncontinues and the extent of recoverable reserves is not yet known. Factors that point to at least \nsome economically viable extraction potential include: (i) onshore natural oil seepages; (ii) the \npresence of sedimentary rocks in several basins; and geological structures that may trap and \nhold oil and gas in reservoirs, and (iii) the similarity between the geology of Cambodia and that \nof adjacent areas in Viet Nam and Thailand where oil and gas have been found and are being \nproduced.  The  country\u2019s  prospective  offshore  extraction  areas  have  been  divided  into  six \noffshore petroleum blocks for selected contractors and some conditional petroleum agreements \nhave been granted by both Cambodia and Thailand (conditional) in a seventh offshore area \nwhere Cambodia\u2019s claims overlap those of Thailand.  Onshore oil and gas exploration blocks \nhave been awarded in 19 areas, three of which have been allocated to contractors in and \naround the Tonle Sap Basin.  \n \n5.  The most advanced exploration work has been in offshore block A, where 27 wells have \nbeen drilled; 18 of them by Chevron starting in 2002. All but one of these wells showed the \npresence of hydrocarbons and several areas within the block have been identified as having \nhydrocarbon  deposits.  In  late  September  2010,  Chevron  applied  to  the  CNPA  for  an  oil \nproduction permit in block A.4 Current estimates of recoverable petroleum reserves are modest. \nHowever, initial development of even a very small, economically marginal oil accumulation of 10 \nmillion barrels of recoverable oil would yield government revenues of about $200 million over a \n6-year period at a crude oil price of $75 per barrel. This would be equivalent to 20% of the \nannual development assistance pledges to Cambodia by various multilateral and bilateral aid \nagencies. Oil production is expected to begin in late 2012, with the government expecting to \nstart receiving revenues from oil exports in 2013. Based on a current mean estimated ultimate \nrecoverable oil reserve in block A of 60 million barrels, government revenue from the sector \ncould be as high as $2 billion over a 20-year period. Cambodia is thus at the inception point of \nits petroleum industry, and will have to navigate through many complex technical issues and \nadministrative issues.  \n \n6.        The government recognizes the importance of good governance in effective development \nof  the  petroleum  sector  and  has  constituted  a  working  group  under  its  Council  for  the \nDevelopment of Cambodia that comprises representatives from the Ministry of Economy and \nFinance and the CNPA. The development partners group led by ADB has been helping the \nCNPA and the government working group to implement the reforms that will allow the CNPA to \nnegotiate with petroleum companies in a transparent manner.   \n \n7.       Further reform will be necessary as the sector moves toward commercial activity. For \nexample, the CNPA may decide to graduate from direct negotiation with contractors in awarding \n                                                \n4 As of now, recoverable gas reserves in Cambodia do not warrant gas development but further exploration may lead \nto the discovery of more accumulations that could be aggregated for economic exploitation. This gas could replace \nexpensive imported petroleum fuels currently used for power generation. \n \n ", "3 \noffshore  blocks,  which  was  appropriate  during  early  resource  prospecting,  to  competitive \nbidding, as required by the Petroleum Regulations, 1991. When oil and gas production begins, \nthe  CNPA  will  be  required  to  (i)  administer,  monitor,  and  regulate  petroleum  production \noperations; (ii) audit oil and gas production; (iii) determine royalties and production shares due \nthe government; and (iv) vouch for the eligibility of costs for contractor\u2019s cost recovery, pursuant \nto the petroleum agreements with private sector oil companies, as well as ensure compliance \nwith environmental and safety regulations.  \n \n8.        Earlier work by both ADB and the Australian Agency for International Development \nshowed that several steps identified in a sector road map could not proceed without remedial \nmeasures on critical weaknesses in the CNPA and improvements in the coordination across \nrelevant  government  ministries  and  agencies.  Of  particular  concern  are  fundamental \ndeficiencies  in  organizational  management  and  staff  motivation  at  the  CNPA.  The  24 \nrecommendations that emerged out of ADB\u2019s prior TAs emphasized the urgency of addressing \nthese issues. Notwithstanding the reforms made by CNPA\u2019s during 2009 and 2010, in order to \nbe more effective, CNPA needs to improve its operational systems and processes, its ability to \nengage with and be informed by other government agencies, and the technical skills and \nmanagement expertise of its staff.5  \n \n9.       CNPA believes that expanding the oil and gas sector will deliver economic development \nbenefits and it is preparing a request for further assistance under a coordinated program-based \napproach (PBA). The PBA will be based on the priority areas and recommendations identified in \nCNPA\u2019s road map and the ADB TA\u2019s recommendations and will adhere to the principles of \nharmonization  and  aid  effectiveness  under  the  Paris  Declaration  and  will  allow  individual \ndevelopment partners to bring their specific expertise to bear. The PBA is also intended to \ncomplement  and  build on  assistance that  is to  be  provided  by  private  sector  oil  and gas \ncompanies under their capacity building support funds6.  \n \n10.      ADB proposes under this TA to continue its leadership role in facilitating dialogue among \nthe stakeholders in Cambodia\u2019s oil and gas sector and in helping ensure effective delivery of \nassistance from the members of the development partners group and the private sector to the \nCNPA and the industry as a whole.  It is expected that by the end of the current TA, oil \nproduction would have commenced in Cambodia and CNPA and the government would have \nthe resources needed to fully support CNPA. Further, it is also likely the further assistance will \nbe made available by the development partners in the near future. This TA will thus pave the \nway for a better resourced and more effective CNPA that is able to manage the country\u2019s \npetroleum resources.  \n \n \n                                                \n5 Good management of the sector requires that competent professionals be deployed within the CNPA in the \ndisciplines of petroleum geology, geophysics, geochemistry, petroleum engineering, and oil and gas regulation. \nDomestic service providers need professionals and tradesmen in construction-related areas such as high-quality \nwelding and mechanical fabrication. Experience in other countries demonstrates that the petroleum sector regulator \ncan play a pivotal role in promoting greater domestic industry involvement by working with national tertiary education \ninstitutions to align course offerings to the needs of the growing sector. \n \n6  The private oil companies under their petroleum exploration agreements with CNPA are required to set up aside \nfunds for training and other capacity building support for CNPA and related ministries within the government of \nCambodia. These funds are managed by the oil companies; however any proposed activities need to be endorsed \nby CNPA.  \n ", "4            \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.       The impact of the TA is increased revenue from the oil and gas sector in Cambodia for \noverall economic development. The outcome will be enhanced institutional and staff capacity \nwithin the CNPA to perform its role as the regulator for Cambodia\u2019s oil and gas sector. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.    The key outputs of the TA will include: (i) an effective contractual regime, including fiscal \nregimes  and  interagency  operation  protocols,  and  workforce  planning  measures  that \ncomplement  these  improvements  implemented;  and  (ii)  institutional  capacity  of  the  CNPA \nstrengthened. Key activities under the first output  will include (i) petroleum economics analyses \nfor upstream oil and gas operations, including an update of modeling of the effects of alternative \ncontractual and fiscal regimes; (ii) formal interagency protocols for environmental and safety \ninspections and approvals; and (iii) workforce planning assessments and studies to determine \nCambodia\u2019s capacity to participate in the petroleum sector, including examination of sector \nmanpower  needs  and  the  capacity  of  higher  and  vocational  education  to  meet  projected \nrequirements. Key activities under the second output will include (i) creation of an institutional \ndevelopment plan and specific training of CNPA staff through an array of modalities on an as-\nneeded  basis,  including  on-the-job  training  and  mentoring  by  resident  expert  advisers;  (ii) \ndevelopment and delivery of short courses, certificate and diploma programs, and study tours or \ninternships  at    private  companies  and  other  regulators;  and  (iii)  the  provision  of  books, \nperiodicals, and audio-visual and interactive learning packages.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.    The cost of the TA is estimated at the equivalent of $440,000. ADB will provide the \nequivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis from the Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). \nThe grant will cover: (i) remuneration, travel, and per diem for the consultants; (ii) related \ntraining seminars and conferences; (iii) IT equipment, books and trainings aids, and (iv) CNPA\u2019s \nsupport  and/or  overhead  costs.  The  government  will  finance  the  equivalent  of  $40,000 \nremaining through its concomitant budgetary inputs to the CNPA.  The cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2.   \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The CNPA will be the executing agency. Within ADB, the TA will be  managed by \nSoutheast Asia Department\u2019s Energy and Water Division. All efforts will be made to fully involve \nother development partners involved in oil and gas sector activities in Cambodia through the \nexisting working group. The TA consultants and ADB will also work to engage with the private \nsector to ensure that their capacity building support committed  to the CNPA and the sector \nalign well with the TA activities. The TA scope, including key outputs, outcome, and impact, \nhave  been  developed  in  close  consultation  with  the  CNPA  and  with  the  various  inter-\ngovernmental  working  groups  it  has  constituted,  which  include  representatives  from  other \ngovernment agencies concerned. \n \n15.  The key assumptions and risks are in the design and monitoring framework in Appendix \n1. It is assumed that broad-ranging management changes made within the CNPA in late 2009 \nhave  brought  the  institution  back  into  conformity  with  established  government  procedures, \n ", "5 \nincluding adherence to prescribed procurement and financial requirements and the deployment \nof dedicated staff for such functions. It is also assumed that the government will continue to \nback  the  development  partners\u2019  effort  to  implement  improved  governance  and  transparent \noperations in the oil and gas sector in Cambodia. The main risk is that the prospect of large \nreturns in the near term could lead to rent seeking or non-transparent operations, as has \nhappened in other countries.  \n \n16.       The TA will require approximately 14 person-months of international consulting services. \nGiven the specialized nature of the inputs required, the TA will be implemented by a team of \nindividual international consultants supervised by the ADB project officer.  ADB's Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time) will be followed in the selection of \nthese consultants. The consultants will comprise a petroleum adviser, who will be engaged for 6 \nperson-months on an intermittent basis throughout the TA, and a series of thematic advisors. \nThe terms of reference for petroleum adviser are in Appendix 2. The adviser will have broad and \nconsiderable petroleum sector experience and an extensive background in the development of \nnational petroleum institutions. The thematic advisers will be engaged on an as-needed basis \nand upon the request of the CNPA to address particular issues and petroleum sector themes \nsuch as petroleum economics, petroleum production accounting, environmental management, \npetroleum  exploration  and  development,  petroleum  financing,  and  human  resources \ndevelopment. It is envisaged that an estimated 8 person-months of inputs would be required \nacross the various disciplines. Terms of reference for each assignment will be prepared during \nimplementation of the TA in consultation with the CNPA. Equipment required under the TA will \nbe procured in accordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to \ntime), and will be turned over to the implementing agencies upon TA completion. Disbursements \nunder  the  TA  will  be  done  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). The TA will be implemented over a 2-year \nperiod from March 2011 to March 2013.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n17.      The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe government of the Kingdom of Cambodia for Capacity Building of the Cambodian National \nPetroleum Authority, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "6      Appendix 1     \n \n                                                    DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance Targets  Data Sources and  Assumptions and Risks  \nSummary  and Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms    \nImpact      Assumptions \n       \nIncreased revenue from  Revenue from the  CNPA annual reports and  The government is committed to \nthe oil and gas sector in  government\u2019s share of  Government of Cambodia  supporting a strong CNPA. \nCambodia available for  oil production increased  budget reports    \noverall economic  by 25% and reflected in    Private sector investment \ndevelopment   the national budget by    continues. \n  2017     \n  External reviews by  The development partners\u2019 \nAward of additional  donors and NGOs   working group continues to be \nproduction and or    active in the sector and, \nexploration contracts (at  Bid award  importantly, the proposed \nleast two distinct  announcements   longer-term NORAD-supported \ncontracts) through    technical assistance is initiated \ncompetitive bidding    in a timely manner. \nprocess by 2015      \n  Conceptual gas   \nIncreased interest by the  development plans   Risks \nprivate sector in the   \nsector, owing to  The prospect of large returns \ntransparent policies and  leads to rent-seeking behavior \npractices.
