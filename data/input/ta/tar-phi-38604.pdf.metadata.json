During  discussions  regarding  the  2005  Interim  Country  Strategy  and  Program, \nagreement  was  reached  between  the  Government  of  the  Philippines  and  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to proceed with a technical assistance (TA) on strengthening local \ngovernment  finance  and  budgeting.  Follow-up  consultations  were  held  in  December  2004 \nbetween the Government and ADB. Both sides reached an understanding on the TA objectives, \nscope,  terms  of  reference,  implementation  arrangements,  and  cost  estimates.1  ADB \nManagement cleared the TA concept in November 2004. The TA framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The 1991 Local Government Code (LGC) was an ambitious attempt to expand the \npolitical  and  economic  role  of  local  government  units  (LGUs).  A  large  portion  of  national \ngovernment spending responsibilities was devolved at that time, and the portion of national \ngovernment revenues flowing to LGUs through intergovernmental transfers was more than \ndoubled to fund that spending. This was seen as a means of bringing government service \ndelivery closer to its end users and as a major step to strengthen democracy, by making LGUs \nmore autonomous, transparent, and accountable. However, after 13 years the LGC\u2019s compelling \nvision has been only partially realized, and LGUs\u2014with few exceptions\u2014are not yet playing their \nanticipated  role.  Urgent  problems  relating  to  core  LGU  budget  functions  are  the  greatest \nimpediment to LGUs\u2019 ability to be effective and accountable. Failure to solve these problems will \nundermine decentralization.  \n \n3.  The pressing fiscal problems facing the national government in 2004 have lent even \ngreater urgency to the need to strengthen LGU finances. Spending by LGUs in 2003 equaled \nP158.2 billion, or 16.1% of total general government expenditures. National budget transfers to \nLGUs consumed 22.5% of annual national government revenue collections. At the same time \nonly 32.6% of LGU expenditures are financed by local revenues, and for a large percentage of \nLGUs  the  share  of  own  revenues  is  considerably  lower.  This  growing  gap  between  LGU \nexpenditures and their own revenues is being filled by expanding transfers from the national \nbudget through the internal revenue allotment (IRA). Increased dependence on the IRA was an \ninevitable result of the decision in 1991 to devolve new expenditures to LGUs and to finance these \nnew expenditures through the IRA. While this dependence was expected to diminish, however, it \nis growing instead: at 67.9% the IRA\u2019s share of total LGU revenues was higher in 2002 than ever \nbefore. Some LGUs, primarily cities, have been more successful in raising their own revenues. \nFor cities as a group in 2002, the share of IRA in total revenues was 47.7%, lower than the 52.5% \nfigure in the early post-LGC years. But comparable numbers for municipalities (78.9%) and \nprovinces (84.6%) showed greater dependence on the IRA than ever before. This runs directly \nagainst the Government\u2019s expectation and policy that the Department of Finance (DOF) should \nhave the objective of making LGUs less dependent on funding from the national government.\u201d2 \n \n4.  Key issues that have impeded LGU financial progress are (i) flaws in the IRA formula, \nleading to a mismatch between the volume of expenditure responsibilities assigned to LGUs and \nof transfers they receive to finance them; (ii) weak LGU ability to access other sources of \nfinancing, such as bank loans and bonds, due to lack of creditworthiness or credible financial \ninformation  to  demonstrate  creditworthiness,  often  reflecting  inadequate  institutional  and \n                                                 \n1 The TA was first listed in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet version) on 15 November 2004.  \n2 Executive Order 127 (1987): Reorganization Act of the Ministry of Finance. ", "2 \ntechnical support; (iii) weak LGU ability to increase own revenues due to legal restrictions, \ninappropriate assignment of tax authority among different levels of local government, poor tax \nadministration capacity, and infrequent LGU reassessment of real property values; (iv) problems \nin LGU expenditure management, including poor medium-term budgeting, excessive personal \nservice expenditures, and non-transparent processes and procedures; and (v) inefficient and \nnon-transparent  LGU  financial  management  practices,  providing  only  limited  local \naccountability. Other problems weaken intergovernmental finance, including the tendency for \nthe number of LGUs to grow steadily in order to take advantage of the IRA formula, and \nproblems with the national government\u2019s income group classification scheme to rank LGU \nperformance and eligibility for participation in programs. \n \n  5.  The Bureau of Local Government Finance (BLGF), attached to DOF, is the national \ngovernment agency that directly addresses these problems. Created by Executive Order 127 \n(30 January 1987), BLGF is headed by an executive director and has five main units: (i) Internal \nAdministration Office, (ii) Policy Enforcement and Special Projects Group, (iii) Field Operations \nExamination Group, (iv) Management and Technical Staff, and (v) Intelligence and Investigation \nOffice. BLGF maintains offices in each region to monitor and provides TA to LGUs in local fiscal \nadministration,  specifically  revenue  generation  and  mobilization.  BLGF  also  appoints  local \ntreasurers and has some quasi-regulatory and supervisory functions over LGUs. Under the LGC \nthe  supervisory  role  of  the  BLGF  has  been  diminished  but  their  developmental  role  and \nfunctions have come to the fore. LGUs look to BLGF as a provider and developer of programs \nand technical assistance services in local taxation and revenue administration, real property \ntaxation and assessment, treasury operations, resource mobilization, and credit financing and \nutilization. \n \n  6.  Growing private sector interest in purchasing LGU debt through municipal bonds is \ncreating a need for accurate and timely financial information on LGUs. BLGF is a key provider of \nthis  much-needed  information  to  financial  advisors,  bond  underwriters,  and  institutional \ninvestors.3  BLGF  recently  developed  the  Statement  of  Income  and  Expenditures  (SIE) \nReporting System and an accompanying set of LGU fiscal and financial performance indicators. \nThe performance indicators need to be improved and the system made more useful for LGUs \nand other clients. This has gained importance because municipal bonds will soon be entered \ninto the Fixed-Income exchange, which will be the beginning of a secondary market for LGU \ndebt. With expanded trade in municipal bonds will come demand for regular credit rating of \nLGUs. This will increase, intensify, and even deepen the need for LGU financial information by \ncredit-rating agencies and investors. Similarly, with increased interest in build-operate-transfer \nand joint venture arrangements, potential investors and partners will need financial information \nto evaluate an LGU\u2019s proposals. \n \n7.  As BLGF\u2019s clientele expands to include new stakeholders in LGU development, such as \nmunicipal bond underwriters and financial advisors, new services need to be developed. With \nthe increasing popularity of municipal bonds as a form of financing, financial advisors are now \napproaching LGUs with offers to package projects for bond financing. LGUs require assistance \nin selecting from the many financial advisors and in determining the most appropriate type of \nfinancing for a project given its nature and the various interest rates. The Bangko Sentral ng \nPilipinas (BSP) and DOF will increasingly seek accurate and regularly updated information on \n                                                 \n3 BLGF is not merely a provider of information but also an integral part of the bond issuance process. Before LGU \nbond flotation, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, the regulatory authority for all bonds, requires BLGF to issue a \ncertificate of maximum debt service before issuing a \u201cno-objection\u201d to the bond floatation.  ", "3  \nthe level and status of LGU debt and related financial information as more and more LGUs enter \ninto debt financing and as concerns about default potential are raised. \n \n8.  BLGF, however, spends most of its time administering and managing local treasurers \n(including processing their appointments and validating and ruling on pending administrative \ncases against them) to the detriment of its more developmental functions. It is urgent that \nBLGF\u2019s databases and analytical systems be expanded and enhanced; old services improved \nand branched out into new services; current activities streamlined, harmonized, rationalized, \nand  made  more  efficient;  in-house  expertise  upgraded  in  training,  capacity  building,  and \ntechnical assistance; and critical legislative agendas pursued.  \n \n9.  ADB has extensive experience in providing technical assistance to the Philippines to \nstrengthen local governance and local government financing. ADB supported the launch of the \nLGC with a TA for implementing the LGC in the health sector in 1993.4 In 2003, ADB and the \nWorld Bank conducted a joint study on \u201cdecentralized service delivery\u201d,5 which is a valuable \nsource of information on a number of issues relevant to this TA. The new TA is designed to \nbuild on ADB efforts and focus on accelerated implementation of core reforms, by developing \naction  plans  that  will  serve  as  inputs  into  planned  ADB  LGU  finance  operations,  and  by \nstrengthening BLGF, a major national government payer in all LGU finance issues. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE  \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n10.  The TA will have two components. Component A will provide an analytical overview and \ndetailed studies of key issues that will help DOF and BLGF design and implement reform of \nLGU finance and budget processes. These studies will identify factors in the legal, policy, and \ninstitutional  frameworks  that  impede  LGUs\u2019  ability  to  function  as  autonomous  and  self-\nsupporting units and propose remedies and concrete action plans to overcome these problems. \nComponent B will enhance the capacity of national government agencies, particularly BLGF, to \nprovide LGUs with services to improve their finances and create and maintain LGU financial \nperformance databases that will strengthen LGU credit markets.  \n   \n11.  Component A. The TA studies will include the following: (i) legal impediments to LGU \nrevenue mobilization; (ii) rationalization of revenue and expenditure assignment between the \nnational government and LGUs, and among different levels of LGUs (provinces, municipalities, \nand cities); (iii) issues regarding the LGU classification system by income group; (iv) revision of \nthe procedures for creating LGUs; (v) proposals for improving LGU financial management, \nincluding  internal  audit  capacity  and  greater  transparency  in  procurement  and  financial \nreporting; (vi) review of LGU accounting practices and procedures, including those of local \ngovernment-owned and -controlled corporations (GOCCs); (vii) review of the IRA formula and \nprocedures, with recommendations for improvement; (viii) obstacles to LGU access to credit, \nand  recommendations  for  overcoming  them;  (ix)  LGU  tax  administration  problems  and \nproposals for remedies; (x) proper management of the growing role of GOCCs in LGU finance; \nand (xi) methodologies for assessing LGU financial performance. The sequence, interlinkages, \nand detailed content of the studies will be determined in the TA\u2019s first phase, based on a review \nby the intergovernmental fiscal relations expert.  \n \n                                                 \n4 ADB. 1993.

", "4 \n12.  Component B. The TA will enhance the skills, tools, and work programs of BLGF, at its \nmain  office  in  Manila  and  regional  offices,  by  conducting  training  and  other  capacity-\ndevelopment  activities,  designing  information  systems,  and  developing  policy-supporting \nmechanisms  needed  to  enhance  the  bureau\u2019s  services.  Technical  assistance  to  BLGF  is \nexpected  to  result  in  more  efficient  and  effective  delivery  of  technical,  policy  advisory, \nmanagement, and administrative assistance to LGUs, and in the creation of a cadre of skilled \ntrainers able to provide high-quality assistance to LGUs throughout the country. The TA will also \nenhance LGU access to credit by improving the BLGF database on LGU financial performance, \nallowing potential lenders to better assess creditworthiness. \n \n1.  Methodology and Key Activities  \n \n13.  In  the  course  of  both  TA  components,  workshops  and  public  consultations  will  be \nconducted  with  stakeholders.  Along  with  the  TA  studies,  government  issuances  such  as \nexecutive orders, departmental orders, administrative orders, and memorandum circulars will be \ndrafted as the need arises, and as a result of recommendations resulting from studies and \nreports  as  well  as  specific  requests  from  DOF  and  BLGF.  Active  engagement  with  other \ndevelopment partners will be maintained throughout to produce outcomes useful to all funding \nagencies working at the LGU level. \n \n14.  Component  A.  The  methodology  of  the  studies  will  include  (i)  desk  studies;  (ii) \nconsultations with national government and LGU officials, nongovernment organizations, and \nlocal  research  organizations;  and  (iii)  consultations  with  private  and  government  financial \ninstitutions.  \n \n15.  Component B. The TA includes expert assistance and other institutional support for \nBLGF to build its capacity and support its administrative development. Activities include (i) \ntraining  selected  region-based  BLGF  officers  to  serve  as  trainers  for  LGUs  on  resource \nmobilization issues; (ii) helping develop a BLGF manual of operations, to include documentation \nof  the  process  for  computing  and  establishing  LGU  debt  service  capacity  and  borrowing \ncapacity; and (iii) helping institutionalize a multisectoral oversight committee to address the \nproblems of LGUs vis-\u00e0-vis the national agenda (e.g., the fiscal deficit and IRA reduction).  \n \n16.   Assistance will also be provided in LGU financial information systems development, and \nin LGU debt monitoring and management. Activities include helping develop (i) an LGU financial \ninformation database in a useful format that can be easily accessed by potential investors or \nbusiness locators; (ii) a database for financial services providers to LGUs, including financial \nadvisors, bond underwriters, bond guarantors, government and private financial institutions, \nfunding agency projects, and others; and (iii) an LGU debt management monitoring system to \nprovide information to the BSP, DOF, LGUs, financial institutions, LGU bond underwriters, LGU \nbond guarantors, private investors in LGU bonds, and the new Fixed-Income Exchange.  \n \n17.  Activities  in  LGU  fiscal  and  administrative  management  will  include  (i)  updating, \nharmonizing, and codifying tax rulings; (ii) helping harmonize the treasurer\u2019s manual with the \nnew government accounting system; (iii) helping develop a manual on various modalities of \ntraditional and nontraditional ways for LGUs to raise and improve their revenues and finances, \nincluding documentation and case studies; and (iv) helping review the policy on LGU economic \nenterprises. \n \n ", "5  \n  2.  Cost and Financing  \n \n18.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,220,000 equivalent, of which $400,000 is the \nforeign exchange cost and $820,000 equivalent the local currency cost. The Government has \nrequested ADB to finance the entire foreign exchange cost as well as $450,000 of the local \ncurrency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA program. The Government \nwill finance local currency costs of $370,000 equivalent by providing office space, staff support, \nand other items. The TA cost estimates and budget are in Appendix 2.  \n \n3.  Implementation Arrangements  \n \n19.  DOF  will  be  the  Executing  Agency.  A  steering  committee,  composed  of  the  DOF \nsecretary, BLGF executive director, and leadership of the Union of Local Authorities of the \nPhilippines or other appropriate LGU organizations, will be established and meet bimonthly. \nBLGF will be the Implementing Agency.  \n \n20.  The TA will require approximately 18 person-months of international and 75 person-\nmonths of domestic consultants with expertise in local government finance, debt and credit \nmanagement, public finance economics, fiscal policy, LGU accounting, national government \naccounting,  local  government  taxation,  local  government  administration,  and  public \nadministration law. Outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. The TA will \nbe  implemented  over  18  months,  from  April  2005  to  October  2006.  Policy  dialogue  and \nconsultation will be carried out with public institutions, the private sector, and other aid agencies. \nTraining materials will be prepared as required.  \n \n21.  The consultants for component A will be engaged as individuals by ADB in accordance \nwith Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the \nengagement  of  domestic  consultants.  One  consultant,  likely  the  intergovernmental  finance \nexpert, will lead the TA, plan and coordinate component-A studies, coordinate cooperation and \nconsultations between the two components, and report to ADB on progress in all TA tasks. The \nconsultants  for  component  B  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  as  a  firm,  in  accordance  with  its \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements acceptable to ADB for engaging \ndomestic consultants, using the simplified technical proposals procedures under ADB\u2019s quality- \nand cost-based system. Equipment under component B will be procured in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $850,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the Philippines for the Local Government Finance and Budget Reform \nProject, and hereby reports this action to the Board.
