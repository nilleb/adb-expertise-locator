INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The technical assistance (TA) will support the Asian Bond Markets Initiative (ABMI) by the \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) plus the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), \nJapan, and the Republic of Korea (ROK) (collectively known as ASEAN+3) through support to the \nCross-Border Settlement Infrastructure Forum (CSIF) to create an efficient regional settlement \nintermediary and promote more active intraregional financial investment.1 Since the CSIF\u2019s \nestablishment in 2013, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has served as its Secretariat and \nsupported it by utilizing its convening power to help tackle regional challenges. \n \n2.  The TA is included in the work program of ADB\u2019s Economic Research and Regional \nCooperation Department (ERCD) for 2020, which is aligned with Strategy 2030\u2019s sixth and \nseventh  operational  priorities:  \u201cstrengthening  governance  and  institutional  capacity\u201d,  and \n\u201cfostering regional cooperation and integration\u201d.2 ADB will help developing member countries \n(DMCs) develop sound financial market infrastructures to support public management reforms \nand financial stability in the region under the sixth operational priority. ADB will also support \ncatalyzing  and  mobilizing  financial  resources  for  development  by  developing  \u201cquality \ninfrastructure  required  for  attracting  private  sector  investment\u201d,  and  \u201cenhancing  domestic \nresource mobilization\u201d by helping \u201cchannel the region\u2019s savings more effectively for productive \ninvestments\u201d, as stated under the seventh operational priority. The TA is also based on the \nASEAN+3 ABMI Medium-Term Road Map, 2019\u20132022, endorsed at the ASEAN+3 Finance \nMinisters\u2019 and Central Bank Governors\u2019 Meeting (AFMGM+3) in Nadi, Fiji in May 2019.3  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  ASEAN+3  finance  ministers  established  the  ABMI  in  August  2003  to  boost  the \ndevelopment of local currency bond markets. Thanks to the efforts of the ASEAN+3 member \neconomies, the local currency bond markets of the ASEAN+3 region have developed significantly \nand  the  region\u2019s  financial  systems  have  become  more  resilient.  However,  despite  the \ndevelopment of the local capital market and high trade integration, the region still faces low \nintraregional portfolio investments and a large infrastructure investment gap as identified in the \nroad map.4 The region\u2019s large savings are returning via international financial centers such as \nLondon and New York. Such recycling of funds outside the region often creates unexpected \nvolatility due to \u201cherd behavior\u201d or the \u201cbandwagon effect\u201d of financial markets. In particular, when \nan unexpected economic event affects certain emerging markets, it may also affect ASEAN+3 \nmember markets, regardless of the economic fundamentals of the ASEAN+3 member economies. \n  \n4.  In  addition,  the  dollar  remains  the  dominant  medium  of  exchange  between  local \ncurrencies. Although intraregional trade accounts for more than 50% of trade in the ASEAN+3 \nregion, the dollar dominates more than 90% of intraregional financial transactions. This high \nreliance  on  the  dollar  in  cross-border  payments  can  trigger  a  shortage  of  dollar  liquidity, \nparticularly  when  the  region  faces  an  unexpected  shock  such  as  the  coronavirus  disease \npandemic. While the dollar remains the international vehicle currency, it is desirable to mitigate \nthe problem at least for intraregional transactions. The region may be able to cope with liquidity \n \n1 CSIF members comprise staff from the ASEAN+3 central banks and central securities depositories (CSDs). Officials \nfrom the ministries of finance and securities and exchange commissions of ASEAN+3 may join as observers. \n2 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 4 August 2020. \n3 The road map is available at https://asianbondsonline.adb.org/documents/abmi_medium_term_road_map.pdf. \n4 The road map identified the following remaining challenges: (i) different levels of bond market development within the \nASEAN+3 region, (ii) a large infrastructure investment gap, (iii) the need for sustainable finance, (iv) low intraregional \nportfolio investments, and (v)  the need for efficient resource mobilization for regional cooperation and integration. \n ", " \n2 \nshortages by expanding the local currency collateral pool to be utilized for local currency\u2013local \ncurrency cross-border transactions. \n \n5.  To address these problems, the CSIF agreed to establish a central securities depository \n(CSD)\u2013real-time gross settlement (RTGS) linkage. These linkages are expected to facilitate \nintraregional portfolio investments and the use of local currency bonds as collateral, which had \nbeen locked in onshore markets. Linkages among national CSDs and central banks\u2019 RTGS \nsystems in different regional markets can realize cross-border, cross-currency delivery-versus-\npayment (DVP) of cross-border securities transactions, as well as payment-versus-payment of \nlocal currencies to enable safe and efficient cross-border financial transactions in the region. Also, \nas  a  sign  of  growing  regional  cooperation  under  the  ABMI,  all  CSIF  members  will  adopt \ninternational standards, including ISO 20022 (possibly by 2023), as the basis for cross-border \ntransactions.  Further,  amid  the  current  regulatory  trend  of  collateralization  in  cross-border \ntransactions, the CSD\u2013RTGS linkages may be able to free up the region\u2019s domestic collateral \npools for cross-border transactions. Based on such discussions under the CSIF, cross-border \nDVP between the Bank of Japan and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority is expected to go live in \n2021 as the initial step in the linkages. \n \n6.  However, to expand the linkages further, the CSIF must pay more attention to recent \ntechnological advancements in financial transactions, such as distributed ledger technology and  \nblockchain technology, which may influence the future technical architecture of the CSD\u2013RTGS \nlinkages and payment and settlement systems.5 Thus, the CSIF must stocktake and share \nexperiences of the ASEAN+3 member markets. As the region is a global front-runner of such \ndevelopments, it may be able to establish a new operational environment without significant costs.  \n \n7.  The CSIF should also pay more attention to promoting a product and infrastructure design \nto catalyze cross-border trading. A collective investment scheme (CIS) and exchange traded \nfunds may be able to channel the vast regional savings to ample investment opportunities within \nthe region. Since the early 2010s, regional fund markets have become more integrated than ever \nwith the launch of three intermarket fund-offering schemes: the ASEAN CIS, PRC\u2013Hong Kong, \nChina Mutual Recognition of Funds, and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Asia Region Funds \nPassport (ARFP).6 These initiatives allow their nine regional member economies to sell funds to \none another once a fund is registered as an offshore-offering fund. To respond proactively to \nthese  concerted  regional  market  integration  efforts  accelerating  intraregional  financial \ntransactions, the CSIF should examine the regional fund market infrastructures further.7  \n \n8.  In addition, to ensure that the future market infrastructure design will facilitate cross-border \ncollateral pooling, the CSIF should study necessary conditions for market infrastructures and \ncentral  banks  to  expand  their  collateral  eligibility  to  non-dollar  and  foreign  local  currency \ngovernment bonds.  \n \n \n5 Other relevant research initiatives include the Bank of Canada\u2019s Project Jasper, the Monetary Authority of Singapore\u2019s \nProject Ubin, and the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan\u2019s joint Project Stella. Details are available at \nhttps://www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/pdf-99/accenture-cross-border-distributed-ledger-technologies.pdf  and \nhttps://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/intro/publications/pdf/ecb.miptopical170101.en.pdf. \n6 The ASEAN CIS was launched among Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand in August 2014; the Mutual Recognition of \nFunds was launched between the PRC and Hong Kong, China in July 2015; and the ARFP was kick-started among \nAustralia, Japan, the ROK, New Zealand, and Thailand in February 2016. Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and \nThailand officially enforced the ARFP in 2019, and the ROK did so in May 2020. \n7 According to the Asia Fund Standardization Forum\u2019s 2019 survey, CSDs run six centralized fund processing platforms \nin the PRC, Japan, ROK, Indonesia, Thailand, and Viet Nam. \n ", " \n3 \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: greater financial stability in the ASEAN+3 \nregion. Promoting regional cross-border financial transactions by developing and spreading well-\nequipped market infrastructures and a local currency\u2013local currency collateral pool will reduce the \nreliance on the dollar and United States Treasury, and serve as another regional safety net to \nsupport financial stability and resilience at the micro level in the region. \n \n10.  The TA will have the following outcome: regional risk management with cross-border \ntransactions enhanced.8 Well-prepared market infrastructures such as the CSD\u2013RTGS linkages \nenabling DVP and payment-versus-payment will realize cross-border, cross-currency financial \ntransactions and substantially reduce cross-border settlement risk. These linkages will also \naddress shortages of collateral and foreign banks\u2019 access to local currency liquidity. \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n11.  As a continued regional cooperation effort, the TA will accumulate outputs stepwise. The \nTA consists of three outputs: (i) a CSIF report, (ii) reports to the ABMI Task Force 4 (TF4), and \n(iii) a linkage among the central banks and CSDs in ASEAN+3. \n \n12.  Output 1: A Cross-Border Settlement Infrastructure Forum report produced. The \nreport will cover three topics: (i) a regional overview of recent technological advancements applicable \nto financial market infrastructures; (ii) a benchmark for product and market infrastructure design for \nregional fund markets and related infrastructures; and (iii) collateral eligibility for market infrastructures \nand central banks, and enabling factors to push local currency collateral utilization for cross-border \nfinancial transactions. Legal and market-related barriers will also be discussed. The CSIF report may \nbe published electronically with the endorsement of the AFMGM+3. \n \n13.  Output 2: Reports to the Asian Bond Markets Initiative Task Force 4 produced. The \nCSIF will meet at least three times a year to discuss technological and market-related issues. \nSince government authorities play an essential role in market infrastructure development and \nASEAN+3 government officials hold full ownership of the TA as mentioned in the Implementation \nArrangements section below, ASEAN+3 government officials (in particular the ABMI TF4) will \nevaluate TA implementation and provide guidance if necessary. To that end, the TA will report \nprogress on the CSIF activities at the semiannual ABMI TF4 meetings. \n \n14.  Output 3: A linkage among the central banks and central securities depositories in \nASEAN+3  implemented  based  on  Cross-Border  Settlement  Infrastructure  Forum \nrecommendations. As a regional safety net to support financial integration, at least one linkage \nwill be implemented based on the agreement initially made between two CSIF members from \nadvanced markets in line with the technological architecture and technical specification agreed \nthrough the CSIF. The first linkage will be a benchmark business case for the agreed linkage \nmodel. The TA will support its implementation by providing further technical specifications if \nnecessary, and will share the implementation experience through a CSIF discussion to propagate \nthe linkage further in the region. \n \n \n8  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", " \n4 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the ROK \ne-Asia  and  Knowledge  Partnership  Fund  (EAKPF)  and  administered  by  ADB.9 The  key \nexpenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. \n \n16.  According to para. 7 of the EAKPF Implementation Guidelines, the fund shall finance \noperational expenses related to eligible activities such as components of investment projects, \nstand-alone grant-financed activities, TA operations, and any other activities agreed upon by the \nGovernment of the ROK and ADB. It will not be used for (i) civil works, (ii) the procurement of \nlarge-scale equipment, (iii) permanent staffing costs, or (iv) the hiring of staff consultants, unless \notherwise agreed between the Government of the ROK and ADB. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  ADB will administer the TA. Staff at the Office of the Chief Economist and Director General \nof ADB\u2019s ERCD will comprise the Secretariat of the CSIF and will organize CSIF meetings in close \ncoordination with the CSIF Chairs. The ERCD will be directly responsible for (i) TA administration \nand supervision, management of consultants, and accomplishment of outputs; (ii) organizing \nmeetings, trainings, or workshops and disseminating knowledge products; (iii) providing staff to \nact  as  resource  persons  for  conferences,  trainings,  or  workshops;  and  (iv)  monitoring  TA \nimplementation. The TA will also be implemented in close coordination with ADB\u2019s Sustainable \nDevelopment and Climate Change Department, Southeast Asia Department, and East Asia \nDepartment. In particular, the Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department\u2019s \nFinance Sector Group and Regional Cooperation and Integration Thematic Group will be closely \nconsulted. The TA will be implemented over 24 months from November 2020 to October 2022.  \n \n18.  The Secretariat of the CSIF may organize regular CSIF meetings at least three times a year \nback-to-back with the ASEAN+3 Bond Market Forum. In addition, with support from CSIF members \nand experts, information on market regulations and practices as well as market infrastructures will \nbe collected.10 All knowledge products under the TA will be disseminated through the CSIF meetings, \nABMI task force meetings, AsianBondsOnline, and ADB\u2019s other existing online platforms. \n \n19.  As the finance ministers and central bank governors of ASEAN+3, or ABMI government \nofficials, hold full ownership of the TA, the TA will be evaluated by the ABMI TF4, consisting of \nofficials from the ministries of finance and central banks of ASEAN+3 and currently co-chaired by \nthe ROK and the Philippines. Official ABMI task force meetings will be held at least semiannually \nto monitor the CSIF\u2019s progress, which will be reported to the ASEAN+3 Finance and Central Bank \nDeputies\u2019 meeting for further guidance. The outputs of the CSIF will be reported to the AFMGM+3 \nfor their endorsement. \n \n20.  In the event that ADB staff act as resource persons for the purpose of effectiveness, travel \ncosts are charged to the TA, but their salaries and benefits are absorbed by the internal \nadministrative expenses budget.11 \n \n21.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in the table. \n \n9 EAKPF funding is subject to government approval. \n10 Prior to the commencement of any activity in the territory of any DMC, a written letter of no objection from the relevant \nDMC will be obtained. \n11 A memo from the Budget, Personnel, and Management Systems Department and Strategy and Policy Department \n(26 June 2013) provides guidance on charging costs to TA and internal administrative expense budgets. \n ", " \n5 \n \nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  November 2020\u2013October 2022 \nExecuting agency  Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nImplementing agencies  The Office of the Chief Economist and Director General of ADB\u2019s \nEconomic Research and Regional Cooperation Department will \nimplement the technical assistance in close coordination with ADB\u2019s \nSustainable Development and Climate Change Department, \nSoutheast Asia Department, and East Asia Department. In \nparticular, the Sustainable Development and Climate Change \nDepartment\u2019s Finance Sector Group and Regional Cooperation and \nIntegration Thematic Group will be closely consulted.  \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \nIndividual selection  International expertise  $225,000 \n(12 person-months) \nIndividual selection  National expertise   $72,000 \n(24 person-months) \nDisbursement  The technical assistance resources will be disbursed following \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2020, as \namended from time to time). \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n22.
