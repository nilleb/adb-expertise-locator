The Viet Nam Country Strategy and Program of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and \nthe partnership agreement between the Government of Viet Nam and ADB identify inclusive \nsocial development as a major focus. In August 2002, the Government, through the Viet Nam \nCommission for Population, Family, and Children (VCPFC), which is the national focal point for \npolicy  on  children,  formally  requested  that  the  ADB  provide  support  for  early  childhood \ndevelopment (ECD), which is an important part of social development.1 \n \n2.  A Reconnaissance Mission visited Viet Nam from 11 to 22 January 2003 and agreed \nwith VCPFC to develop advisory technical assistance (TA) to increase understanding of the \nneeds of poor children in Viet Nam and to promote ECD for the poor. The Poverty Reduction \nCooperation Fund gave concept clearance in February 2003. An ADB Fact-Finding Mission was \nin Viet Nam 22\u201327 June to finalize the Project. The TA is listed in the 2003 Country Strategy \nand Program Update for Viet Nam. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Viet  Nam  has  seen  remarkable  development  during  the  past  decade,  with  strong \neconomic growth, significant poverty reduction, and noticeable improvements in the human \ncapital of the population. Viet Nam has made substantial progress in meeting the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals: reducing poverty from 58% to 29% between 1993 and 2001 reaching near \nuniversal primary enrollment and substantially increasing access to health care. Viet Nam has \nreduced infant and child mortality substantially, with infant mortality dropping from 44 per 1,000 \nin 1992 to around 30 in 2001.   \n \n4.  Despite these overall gains there are concerns about the quality of human capital, and \ngrowing  income  and  human  capital  inequality.  Although  mortality  has  declined,  levels  of \nmalnutrition remain high.  During the 1990s, the level of child malnutrition (measured by the \nheight for age) remained stable, with about a third of children stunted.  There is significant and \ngrowing regional inequality and many communes have not fully benefited from the development \nseen in the past decade. Evidence shows that the living standards of the poorest 30% of the \npopulation  did  not  increase  substantially  during  the  1990s  and  that  children  from  poor \nhouseholds did not receive the same level of investment as their peers.2 Critical prenatal care, \nfacilities for attended births, and health care for infants are often limited or inaccessible to poor \nwomen  particularly  in  mountainous,  remote,  and  difficult  areas.  Children  from  poor  and \nvulnerable households often have little access to day care, preschool, and kindergarten, and \nthus are disadvantaged compared with other children when they enter primary school. \n \n5.  Continued  progress  in  poverty  reduction  requires  more  targeted  and  focused \ninterventions aimed at improving the welfare of groups that have not benefited from economic \ngrowth and social development. Numerous studies have shown the long-term negative effect of \nlow investment in the early years of children: reduced capacity to work, lower intellectual \ndevelopment, and limited motor and social skills. In essence, children face the risk of being \ntrapped in a vicious circle of poverty, as their parents cannot afford the necessary investment in \nhuman capital that they will need as adults to escape from poverty.3 \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) in February 2003.  \n2  Bhushan, I., E. Bloom, N.H. Huu, and N.M. Thang. 2001. Human Capital of the Poor. Manila: ADB. \n3  Dasgupta, P. 1993.  An Inquiry into Well-Being and Destitution. Oxford: Oxford University Press.  ", "2 \n \n6.  Low investment in childhood development in the first few years of life leads to lower \ncognitive development and reduced school performance, which have a lasting effect on health \nand the ability to work as an adult. Since malnutrition is increasingly concentrated among the \npoor,  the  vicious  circle  of  poverty  may  be  perpetuated  with  poor  children  becoming \nmalnourished as adults and unable to work to capacity.  \n \n7.  Government investment in ECD has been low, but is increasing. ECD crosses the \ntraditional sectoral boundaries and the Government has developed a number of strategies and \npolicies to promote ECD, particularly focusing on households in poor and remote regions and in \ndifficult circumstances. The Program for Action for Children, 2001\u20132010, is an omnibus program \nthat establishes quantitative targets and goals for children, covering both health and education. \nIn addition, the Population Strategy of Viet Nam, 2001\u20132010; National Strategy for Reproductive \nHealth Care, 2001\u20132010; Education Strategy, 2001\u20132010; and National Strategy for Nutrition, \n2001\u20132010 all specifically promote ECD as key to sustainable and long-term poverty reduction. \nVCPFC is the lead coordinating body for ECD activities in Viet Nam. It is responsible both for \ncoordinating the activities of line ministries at the national and provincial levels and for applied \npolicy research on issues related to children.  \n \n8.  A variety of providers including both private and public preschools and kindergartens \noffer child care and pre-school education. Parents, grandparents, and other relatives play an \nimportant role in child care, especially for poor households. In an effort to increase investment in \npreschool,  the  Government  recently  approved  Decision  161  of  2002,  which  mandates  an \nincrease in access to and quality of preschool education. Despite the importance of preschool \neducation  for  the  transition  of  children  (particularly  children  from  poor  and  vulnerable \nhouseholds) to primary school, there has been little external support.  \n \n9.  Viet Nam has maintained a strong record of child immunization. Although the health \nservices offer access to prenatal care and attended deliveries, access is often a major issue. \nResearch suggests that poor and ethnic minority women are significantly less likely to avail of \nsuch services due to both issues of access (cost and distance of services) and cultural barriers. \nGovernment and external support for nutrition programs providing nutritional supplements and \nremoving parasites and worms has been limited.  \n \n10.  ADB has been active in promoting human development in Viet Nam, with projects in \nhealth, nutrition, population, and education. The Poverty Partnership Agreement signed by the \nGovernment and ADB identifies inclusive social development as an important area for continued \ncooperation in achieving the joint agenda of poverty reduction. ADB support for ECD is a logical \nand supportive extension of these activities and is an important avenue for focusing ADB's \nsupport for poverty reduction on children.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n11.  The long-term goal of the TA is to support Viet Nam in developing a safe and healthy \nenvironment for children from poor and vulnerable households  that  will  provide  them  with \ngreater opportunity to reach their full human potential. To achieve this goal, the TA has several \nobjectives: (i)  understand the current status and availability of ECD programs, particularly in \npoor and remote areas; (ii) develop appropriate qualitative and quantitative survey instruments ", "    3 \nfor the TA and for research and policy work in ECD; and (iii) increase stakeholders' awareness \nand support for ECD as a key instrument to break the vicious circle of poverty.  \n \n12.  The main outputs of the TA will be (i) quantitative and qualitative surveys of children, \nhouseholds, and ECD providers, focusing on eight poor and remote provinces; (ii) a detailed \nassessment of ECD needs, including child health, nutrition, child care, and preschool education; \nand (iii) an integrated investment strategy to advocate and promote ECD, including identifying \nthe financing gap and financing sources. A draft outline of the final reports is in Appendix 2.  \n \n13.  The  TA  is  divided  into  five  interrelated  components:  (i)  surveys  and  participatory \nassessment (component A), (ii) analysis and assessment of child care and preschool education \n(component B), (iii) analysis and assessment of child health and nutrition (component C), (iv) \ndevelopment of strategies to support ECD (component D), and (v) advocacy and dissemination \n(component  E).  The  components  will  be  developed  together,  but  each  will  have  its  own \nmilestones and schedule.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The TA will improve understanding of the health, nutrition, child care, and education \nneeds of children from poor and vulnerable households. The definition of the age group of ECD \nvaries. The TA will focus on children between the ages of 0 and 6 and will include safe \nmotherhood. The TA will cover supply-side, institutional, and demand-side issues.  \n \n15.  Surveys  and  Participatory  Assessments  (Component  A).    The  first  step  in  \ndeveloping a sector strategy and investment plan for ECD is to develop a deeper understanding \nof the ECD needs of poor and vulnerable households. Institutional and household perspectives \nare required. Building on existing surveys (including both general household surveys and more \nspecialized surveys focusing on health and population), the TA will develop a knowledge, \nattitude, and practices survey of ECD.  \n \n16.  The survey will be designed following standard survey practices in Viet Nam and will \nupdate existing knowledge in eight selected poor provinces. It will cover both Kinh and ethnic \nminority populations including ethnic minority survey clusters. The survey can also serve as a \nbaseline for future ECD activities in the eight provinces. There will be modules on child health \nand  nutrition,  preschool  education,  childhood  disability  and  chronic  conditions, household \nsituation, and maternal health and knowledge of good practices. The survey will also have \nmodules on community development, and access to ECD services, and a survey of ECD \nproviders.  \n \n17.  Analysis and Assessment of Child Care and Preschool Education (Component B). \nThe component will analyze current practices in child care and preschool education and identify \nmajor gaps in coverage of these services, focusing specifically on children from poor and \nvulnerable households. The component will identify the budget and human resources needed to \nimplement  Decision  161  of  2002  and  to  ensure  that  children  from  poor  and  vulnerable \nhouseholds benefit from the additional resources made available as part of Decision 161.    \n \n18.  Analysis and Assessment of Child Health and Nutrition (Component C).  Building \non existing data and on literature review, including previous ADB-funded needs assessments in \nhealth and nutrition, this component will focus on quantifying the unmet need of poor mothers \nand  children  in  health  and  nutrition  and  the  resource  requirements  to  implement  the \nGovernment's child health and nutrition strategies.   ", "4 \n \n19.  Both  components  B  and  C  will  have  supply-side  and  demand-side  analyses\u2014an \nassessment of the distribution of services throughout the country, the benefit incidence of public \nspending, and an analysis of the appropriateness of public policy, including the training of ECD \nproviders. There will also be an assessment of the willingness and ability to pay for ECD \nservices, and the poor\u2019s preferences and beliefs regarding ECD.  \n \n20.  Development of Strategies (Component D).  The TA will support ongoing efforts to \ndevelop and implement ECD strategies and will complement the efforts of other stakeholders, \nincluding  the  Government  and  development  partners.  Specifically,  the  TA  will  develop  an \nintegrated investment strategy for ECD that identifies the infrastructure and training needs for \nECD development, and the gaps in policy to support the greater private provision of ECD, and \nquantifies the financial gap needed for investment.   \n \n21.  Dissemination and Advocacy (Component E). The TA aims to inform stakeholders of \nthe importance of ECD for poverty reduction and to provide options for future investment in \nECD. The TA findings will be disseminated and promoted to encourage greater coordination \nand increased investment in ECD. The target will be a number of stakeholders, including \nnational and local policymakers, private and nongovernment organizations, and development \npartners.  \n \n22.  In Viet Nam, local governments have the authority to allocate their resources among \nalternate investments. One key activity of the TA will be to work with local authorities and other \nlocal organizations to sharpen their focus on children through increased investment in ECD. The \nTA will design tool kits to advocate ECD at the local level and to help local decision makers and \nservice providers design and implement ECD strategies at their level. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n23.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $563,000 equivalent, comprising $233,200 in \nforeign exchange and $329,800 equivalent in local currency costs. The TA will be financed on a \ngrant basis from the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund, including all  the foreign currency \ncosts and $216,800 equivalent of the local currency costs. ADB financing will cover consulting \nservices;  production  of  reports;  organization  of  workshops  and  studies;  quantitative  and \nqualitative surveys; and translation, administrative, and support services. The Government will \nfinance the balance of the local currency costs, equivalent to $113,000, through the provision of \ncounterpart staff, office accommodation, office support and translation services, and availability \nof meeting rooms. See cost estimates and financing plan in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n24.  VCPFC will be the Executing Agency (EA) for the TA. A team of three international (9 \nperson-months) and three domestic consultants (21.0 person-months) will be recruited to provide \nspecialist services totaling 30 person-months. International consultants will provide services in \nthese  areas:  (i)  early  childhood  development  (5.0  person-months),  (ii)  early  childhood \ndevelopment economics and financing (2.0 person-months), and (iii) surveys (2.0 person-months). \nThe domestic consultants will be specialists in (i) early childhood health and nutrition needs (7.0 \nperson-months),  (ii)  early  childhood  education  needs  (7.0  person-months),  and  (iii)  social \ndevelopment (7.0 person-months).  \n ", "    5 \n25.  All the consultants will be engaged as individuals in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants and other arrangements for recruiting domestic consultants satisfactory to \nADB. Outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 4.  \n \n26.  An interministerial steering committee, chaired by VCPFC, will be established to provide \noverall technical guidance to the TA and to ensure coordination with other concerned ministries. \nThe committee will include representatives from the Ministry of Health; Ministry of Education and \nTraining; Ministry of Culture and Information; and Ministry of Labor, Invalids, and Social Affairs. \nThe steering committee will provide overall strategic guidance and will consult closely with \nrepresentatives  from  other  government  agencies  to  ensure  that  there  is  wide  Government \nconsensus  in  support  of  the  TA  recommendations.  The  Government  is  developing  a  plan \nclarifying the roles and responsibilities of each participating stakeholder agency.     \n \n27.  As EA, VCPFC, has a strong record in administering projects and in providing technical \nleadership in ECD. It will integrate the TA into its ongoing policy research agenda and, in \ncoordination with ADB, provide administrative and technical guidance to the TA team. A project \nmanagement unit (PMU) under the leadership of VCPFC will be established to administer the \nproject. The PMU will have five members: the project director, the deputy project director, and \nthree administrative staff. The staff will work full-time for the project duration. VCPFC will ensure \nthat the PMU is adequately staffed.  \n \n28.  The TA will organize a number of consultative workshops. A national inception workshop \nin the first month will discuss the TA activities and finalize the design of the survey. Additional \nworkshops will discuss the results of components A, B, and C. The TA will also sponsor several \nworkshops for local policymakers in the eight selected provinces, both to disseminate the results \nand to obtain their views. The final workshop will finalize the project and discuss the results. In \naddition to the workshops, regular consultations will involve ADB, the consulting team, and other \ninternational agencies.  The TA will be implemented over 12 months from October 2003 to \nOctober 2004. The TA team leader will submit a draft inception report to ADB and VCPFC within 2 \nweeks from the start of the TA, an interim report 1 month after the first national workshop, and a \nfinal draft report by October 2004. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n29.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $450,000 to the Government \nof Viet Nam to be financed on a grant basis by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund for \nEarly Childhood Development for the Poor, and hereby reports this action to the Board.
