INTRODUCTION\n1. The Government of Thailand has requested technical assistance (TA)' to help\nprepare a waste management action plan and a waste management project for the Bangkok\nMetropolitan Region (BMR).' The Fact-Finding Mission fielded from 5 to 7 October 1994 held\ndiscussions with officials of the Pollution Control Department (PCD) of the Ministry of Science,\nTechnology and Environment (MOSTE) and other officials, international agencies, and\nnongovernment organizations. The Mission reached an understanding with the Government on\nthe scope, cost estimates, and implementation arrangements for the TA and the terms of\nreference for the consultants.\nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. The rapid pace of urban development and industrialization in Thailand has\noutstripped the pace of environmental protection. Waste management systems in particular have\nnot been able to support the rapid industrial development nor the needs of the growing urban\npopulation. The discharge of industrial, commercial, and domestic wastewater in the BMR and\nthe discharges generated by more intensive agricultural practices, have caused a significant\ndecline in environmental quality. The region's canals, known as khlongs, and natural waterways\nare heavily polluted. In the lower reaches of the region's major river, the Chao Phaya, and in\nmany of Bangkok's khlongs, the dissolved oxygen, which is essential for the oxidation of waste\nproducts and a balanced ecology, is almost totally depleted during the dry season each year.\nToxic material discharged in industrial wastewaters exacerbate the problem. The lower reaches\nof the Chao Phaya River, together with many of its tributary khlongs and watercourses, are\nalmost biologically dead.\n3. Household sewage disposal in BMR, in common with practice throughout\nThailand, has traditionally been the responsibility of individual households, regulated by local\ngovernments. Local governments receive financial and technical assistance from provincial and\ncentral Government agencies, such as the Department of Public Works (DPW). The cesspits and\nseptic tanks, which are installed at most houses, however, are not suitable for the city's dense\ndevelopment. The ground, which in many localities is waterlogged, lacks the drainage capacity\nto absorb wastewater.\n4. Onsite wastewater treatment has also been adopted for industries, which by law\nare required to treat their wastes before discharge. The Department of Industrial Works (DIW) of\nthe Ministry of Industry, which is responsible for regulating such treatment systems, has met with\nsome success. Many older industries, however, have either no treatment at all or provide very\ncrude treatment at best, and in Bangkok as elsewhere such industries discharge the essentially\nuntreated wastewater in with the overflowing domestic sewage that pollutes drains, khlongs,\nrivers, and coastal waters.\nThe TA was first listed in ADB Business Opportunities in November 1994.\nBMR comprises the central Bangkok metropolitan area, administered by Bangkok Metropolitan Authority, and\nthe surrounding provinces of Samut Sakhon, Nakhon Pathom, Nonthaburi, Pathum Thani, and Samut\nPrakarn, which include extensive areas of dense residential and industrial development.\nn I\t I n\t Tn Tu c", "K,\n5. Seven major wastewater management planning studies were carried out between\n1968 and 1993 for Bangkok. All but two of these focused on the Bangkok Metropolitan Authority\n(BMA) or Samut Prakarn and none addressed the issue of whether the proposed investments\nwould be suited to the wastewater management needs of the overall BMR as this region\ncontinues to grow and develop. Implementation of study recommendations was initially hindered\nbecause of the large investment required and the low Government priority. More recently the\nGovernment has given high priority to wastewater management, however, the National\nEnvironment Board and PCD, have expressed concern about the piecemeal approach to the\nplanning of the projects and the high costs and complexity of operations associated with the\napproach. As a result of this concern, the Government has approached the Bank to assist in\nevaluating the options for wastewater management in Bangkok.\n6. In view of the increasing levels of pollution, the more recent studies have\npromoted the use of centralized wastewater collection, treatment, and disposal systems. DPW\nis supervising the feasibility studies and the design and construction of centralized sewerage\nsystems for about 40 local authorities throughout Thailand. The BMA has embarked on feasibility\nstudies for the design and construction of eight sewage collection and treatment systems to\nserve central Bangkok. The Industrial Estates Authority of Thailand provides central wastewater\ncollection and treatment systems in its industrial estates. The DIW is responsible for the\nregulation of central treatment systems in private industrial estates. Most approaches in major\nurban centers, however, lack integration, while the planned solutions for some urban centers are\nuneconomic.\n7. Environmental control was strengthened by new legislation in 1992 and is\nexercised through a National Environment Board, which prepares environmental policy and\noversees its implementation. Environmental plans are prepared by MOSTE, which also\nestablishes environmental quality standards, enforces regulations, provides training, carries out\nresearch, conducts monitoring, and mobilizes funds. These functions are exercised through\nMOSTE's three environmental divisions, the Office of Environmental Policy and Planning, the\nDepartment of Environmental Quality Promotion, and PCD. All provinces are required to prepare\nenvironmental management action plans, while areas with severe pollution problems may be\ndeclared pollution control zones. The PCD has the authority under law to initiate action to reduce\npollution.\n8. The Bank has embarked on a program to assist in the planning and\nimplementation of environmental improvement in Thailand, particularly for wastewater\nmanagement. In 1986, the Bank provided a TA to study the feasibility of a centralized wastewater\ncollection and treatment project for industrial wastes in the province of Samut Prakarn, which is\nsouth of BMR.' In 1992, the National Economic and Social Development Board requested Bank\nassistance to review proposals by BMA for water pollution control projects in Bangkok and to\nreview institutional and cost recovery issues related to the sector. That review 2 resulted in\nrecommendations to establish a wastewater management agency for Bangkok with authority to\nplan, implement, operate, maintain, and recover costs for high priority urban wastewater\nmanagement projects.\nTA No. 789-THA: Samut Prakarn Industrial Pollution Control and Management, for $200,000, approved on\n5 August 1986.\nCarried out by Bank staff consultants.\nMIR11\nIs ", "3\n9. In 1992, the Bank provided a TA for planning and financing environmental\nimprovements, using wastewater management in Samut Prakarn as a case study.' This was\nfollowed in 1993 by a TA to prepare a feasibility study for wastewater management in Samut\nPrakarn,2 which is expected to result in an investment project in 1995. In 1992, the Bank also\nprovided TA that assisted PCD standardize its approach to sewerage system design.3\n10. Based on the recommendations of a 1994 World Bank-financed institutional study\nand in recognition of the existing complexity of Government responsibilities for wastewater\nmanagement, the Government is considering establishing a Waste Management Agency (WMA)\nto consolidate the overall responsibilities for the sector. The WMA would be technically-oriented\nand would be responsible for planning, designing, constructing, operating, and maintaining\ninterceptor sewers, treatment plants, and industrial and domestic wastewater disposal facilities.\nThe WMA would monitor the control of pollution in BMR and would finance and manage its\nfacilities in cooperation with other concerned agencies.\ntt\n11. These earlier studies have drawn a ention to the critical need to prepare an\ninvestment program for wastewater management in BMR, based on an action plan that identifies\nprojects that will provide maximum environmental benefits at minimum capital cost, and\noperation and maintenance costs. BMA and PCD propose to construct 45 wastewater treatment\nplants, some of which would be located in densely populated urban areas, at a total cost of\nmore than $1 billion equivalent. Based on the results of the TA for Samut Prakarn, it is expected\nthat greater environmental benefits may be achieved at less cost by constructing a smaller\nnumber of wastewater treatment plants in the BMR. The World Bank-financed study suggested\nthat, by reducing the number of wastewater treatment facilities, savings of 50 percent, 65 percent\nand 80 percent would be achieved respectively in capital, operating, and maintenance costs, and\ngreater environmental benefits would accrue.\nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objective\n12. The objective of the proposed TA is to prepare a Bangkok Metropolitan Region\ntt\nWastewater Management Action Plan (BMRWMAP) se ing out a technically and financially viable\nprogram of wastewater management project investments over the next 20 years.' The TA will\ninclude preparation of a feasibility study for the highest priority wastewater management project\nidentified in the BMRWMAP. The TA will also recommend an institutional framework for\nimplementation of the Action Plan by a new WMA and a financial management framework that\nassures long-term cost recove  and financial viability.\nry\n'\t TA No. 1741-THA: Environmental Rehabilitation Project, for $350,000, approved on 18 August 1992.\n2\t TA No. 2014-THA: Wastewater Management and Pollution Control in Samut Prakarn, for $600,000, approved\non 14 December 1993.\n3\t TA No. 1792-THA: Establishment of an Environmental Unit in PCD, for $250,000, approved on 24 November\n1992.\nThe Bank's Operational Strategy for Thailand strongly suppo rts an active role by the Bank in promoting and\nfinancing projects to address the severe environmental degradation.\n^.....\u00ab. ^,,, ,__...sue _...,^..x\u2022. ouc,sas_^vn^^u^c_^+ray^o\u2022[cac_naara.rutno^on.vr^rr^arcrr.rL-^.s^t.hrf\u2022,\u2022\u2022.\u2022,\u2022", "4\nB.\t Scope\n13. The TA will be carried out with the assistance of consultants in two parts. Under\nPart 1 the BMRWMAP will be formulated, the investment projects will be prioritized, and\nrecommendations will be made for its implementation. The study will focus on identifying the\nmost cost-effective means of collection, treatment, and disposal of municipal and industrial\nwastewater throughout BMR, such as providing interceptor sewers to transport the wastewater\nfrom communities to common treatment and disposal systems. The need to segregate\nwastewater from stormwater and to provide separate sanitary sewers within individual\ncommunities will also be considered at a conceptual level. A corporate plan for the WMA will be\nrecommended to address cost recovery and methods of financing as well as staffing and\noperational matters. Cost-effectiveness will be a determinant factor in the assessment of the\nalternatives and in the final decision on the projects to be included in the BMRWMAP.\nSustainability will be addressed through examination of the various options including community\nparticipation and establishment of cost recovery policies including mechanisms to finance\noperations and maintenance initially and to achieve full cost recovery over time. Part 2 of the TA\nwill be based on the findings of the BMRWMAP. The highest priority project that will be\ncost-effective for a specified desirable level of environmental benefits will be identified and a\nfeasibility analysis of the project will be carried out.\n14. The BMRWMAP study will develop a master planning and will provide sufficient\ninformation to enable formulation of conclusions and recommendations as to the optimal system\nof regional wastewater treatment and disposal facilities for BMR. The previous wastewater\nmanagement studies in BMR will be used as sources for the database for the BMRWMAP and\nfeasibility analysis and lessons learned from such studies as well as ongoing implementation of\nsimilar projects will be evaluated. The study will clearly identify the most economic and\ncost-effective regional system that will support urban and industrial growth in the BMR. The\nBMRWMAP will include sufficient analysis to indicate the general design criteria and magnitude\nof costs.\nC.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Arrangements\n15. The total cost of the TA is estimated as $985,000, comprising $530,000 equivalent\nin foreign exchange costs and $455,000 equivalent in local currency costs. All the foreign\nexchange costs and $70,000 in local currency equivalent amounting to $600,000 will be financed\nby the Bank. The Bank's financing will cover the remuneration, per diem, travel, transport, and\nother costs associated with the engagement of consultants. The remaining local currency costs\nof $385,000 equivalent will be financed by the Government and will cover remuneration of\ncounterpart staff and office accommodation, laboratory services, field surveys, and other local\nfacilities and services. The detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 1.\nD.\t Implementation Arrangements\n16. PCD will be the executing agency for the TA. The TA will be implemented over an\neight-month period. The executing agency will provide a project coordinator, full-time counterpart\nprofessionals totaling about 65 person-months, support staff, office space, and facilities. The\nexecuting agency will be responsible for coordinating, steering, and monitoring the counterpart\nactivities.", "5\n17. A Steering Committee, chaired by the Director General of PCD, will be formed to\nguide and review the results of the TA. The Steering Committee will include representatives of\nBMA, provincial governments in BMR, PCD, Ministry of Finance, and the Office of Environmental\nPolicy and Planning of MOSTE. PCD will arrange monthly review meetings to discuss progress\nand provide guidance to the consultants.\n18. The TA will be undertaken by consultants who will be selected in accordance with\nthe Bank's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. About 18 person-months of international\nconsultant services and about 10 person-months of domestic consultant services will be\nrequired. The international consultants will provide the team leader and expertise in the fields of\nwastewater management planning (8 person-months), environmental and social economics (4\nperson-months), urban infrastructure financial analysis (4 person-months), and corporate\nplanning and financial management (2 person-months). The domestic consultants will provide\na sanitary engineer acting as deputy team leader (8 person-months) and other fields of expertise\nas required. The outline terms of reference for the consulting services is in Appendix 2.\nProcurement of equipment by the Bank-financed consultants will be in accordance with\nprocedures satisfactory to the Bank.\n19. The Government's counterpart team will carry out the preparatory work, under\nthe direction of the PCD Director General. Prior to the fielding of the Bank consultants, the\ncounterpart team will assemble and review relevant reports; describe ongoing programs; review\nexisting regulations and guidelines; define jurisdictional and other logical geographic planning\nboundaries of subareas by similar waste load and flow characteristics; evaluate land use\ndevelopment including existing land use and planned land development; quantify domestic\nwastewater discharges and projections to match planned or likely development; review receiving\nwater quality and water quality objectives; review environmental conditions and predict future\nconditions with and without improved wastewater management; undertake socioeconomic,\nhealth, and attitude surreys; prepare geographic information system (GIS) base maps and\ndatabases by collating and reviewing available land maps, planning maps, and databases; and\nprepare to the extent possible, GIS base maps, and linked databases.\n20. The consultants will submit an inception report at the end of the first month after\nmobilization, an interim report describing the BMRWMAP after the fifth month, at which time a\nTA workshop will be held to discuss the report findings and recommendations, and a draft final\nreport describing the feasibility study of the priority project after the seventh month. Tripartite\nmeetings as necessary will be held among the Government, the Bank and the consultants to\ndiscuss the TA reports. A final report will be submitted one month after comments on the draft\nfinal report have been made by the Government and the Bank.\nIV. THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n21. The President, acting under the authority delegated to him by the Board, has\napproved the provision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, to the Government of Thailand\nin an amount not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 for the purpose of the Bangkok\nMetropolitan Region Wastewater Management Action Plan and Feasibility Study, and hereby\nreports his action to the Board.\nA.", "Appendix 1\nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN\nForeign\t Local\t Total\nExchange Currency\t Costs\nA.

These functions are exercised through\nMOSTE's three environmental divisions, the Office of Environmental Policy and Planning, the\nDepartment of Environmental Quality Promotion, and PCD. All provinces are required to prepare\nenvironmental management action plans, while areas with severe pollution problems may be\ndeclared pollution control zones. The PCD has the authority under law to initiate action to reduce\npollution.\n8. The Bank has embarked on a program to assist in the planning and\nimplementation of environmental improvement in Thailand, particularly for wastewater\nmanagement. In 1986, the Bank provided a TA to study the feasibility of a centralized wastewater\ncollection and treatment project for industrial wastes in the province of Samut Prakarn, which is\nsouth of BMR.' In 1992, the National Economic and Social Development Board requested Bank\nassistance to review proposals by BMA for water pollution control projects in Bangkok and to\nreview institutional and cost recovery issues related to the sector. That review 2 resulted in\nrecommendations to establish a wastewater management agency for Bangkok with authority to\nplan, implement, operate, maintain, and recover costs for high priority urban wastewater\nmanagement projects.\nTA No. 789-THA: Samut Prakarn Industrial Pollution Control and Management, for $200,000, approved on\n5 August 1986.\nCarried out by Bank staff consultants.\nMIR11\nIs ", "3\n9. In 1992, the Bank provided a TA for planning and financing environmental\nimprovements, using wastewater management in Samut Prakarn as a case study.' This was\nfollowed in 1993 by a TA to prepare a feasibility study for wastewater management in Samut\nPrakarn,2 which is expected to result in an investment project in 1995. In 1992, the Bank also\nprovided TA that assisted PCD standardize its approach to sewerage system design.3\n10. Based on the recommendations of a 1994 World Bank-financed institutional study\nand in recognition of the existing complexity of Government responsibilities for wastewater\nmanagement, the Government is considering establishing a Waste Management Agency (WMA)\nto consolidate the overall responsibilities for the sector. The WMA would be technically-oriented\nand would be responsible for planning, designing, constructing, operating, and maintaining\ninterceptor sewers, treatment plants, and industrial and domestic wastewater disposal facilities.\nThe WMA would monitor the control of pollution in BMR and would finance and manage its\nfacilities in cooperation with other concerned agencies.\ntt\n11. These earlier studies have drawn a ention to the critical need to prepare an\ninvestment program for wastewater management in BMR, based on an action plan that identifies\nprojects that will provide maximum environmental benefits at minimum capital cost, and\noperation and maintenance costs. BMA and PCD propose to construct 45 wastewater treatment\nplants, some of which would be located in densely populated urban areas, at a total cost of\nmore than $1 billion equivalent. Based on the results of the TA for Samut Prakarn, it is expected\nthat greater environmental benefits may be achieved at less cost by constructing a smaller\nnumber of wastewater treatment plants in the BMR. The World Bank-financed study suggested\nthat, by reducing the number of wastewater treatment facilities, savings of 50 percent, 65 percent\nand 80 percent would be achieved respectively in capital, operating, and maintenance costs, and\ngreater environmental benefits would accrue.\nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objective\n12. The objective of the proposed TA is to prepare a Bangkok Metropolitan Region\ntt\nWastewater Management Action Plan (BMRWMAP) se ing out a technically and financially viable\nprogram of wastewater management project investments over the next 20 years.' The TA will\ninclude preparation of a feasibility study for the highest priority wastewater management project\nidentified in the BMRWMAP. The TA will also recommend an institutional framework for\nimplementation of the Action Plan by a new WMA and a financial management framework that\nassures long-term cost recove  and financial viability.\nry\n'\t TA No. 1741-THA: Environmental Rehabilitation Project, for $350,000, approved on 18 August 1992.\n2\t TA No. 2014-THA: Wastewater Management and Pollution Control in Samut Prakarn, for $600,000, approved\non 14 December 1993.\n3\t TA No. 1792-THA: Establishment of an Environmental Unit in PCD, for $250,000, approved on 24 November\n1992.\nThe Bank's Operational Strategy for Thailand strongly suppo rts an active role by the Bank in promoting and\nfinancing projects to address the severe environmental degradation.\n^.....\u00ab. ^,,, ,__...sue _...,^..x\u2022. ouc,sas_^vn^^u^c_^+ray^o\u2022[cac_naara.rutno^on.vr^rr^arcrr.rL-^.s^t.hrf\u2022,\u2022\u2022.\u2022,\u2022", "4\nB.\t Scope\n13. The TA will be carried out with the assistance of consultants in two parts. Under\nPart 1 the BMRWMAP will be formulated, the investment projects will be prioritized, and\nrecommendations will be made for its implementation. The study will focus on identifying the\nmost cost-effective means of collection, treatment, and disposal of municipal and industrial\nwastewater throughout BMR, such as providing interceptor sewers to transport the wastewater\nfrom communities to common treatment and disposal systems. The need to segregate\nwastewater from stormwater and to provide separate sanitary sewers within individual\ncommunities will also be considered at a conceptual level. A corporate plan for the WMA will be\nrecommended to address cost recovery and methods of financing as well as staffing and\noperational matters. Cost-effectiveness will be a determinant factor in the assessment of the\nalternatives and in the final decision on the projects to be included in the BMRWMAP.\nSustainability will be addressed through examination of the various options including community\nparticipation and establishment of cost recovery policies including mechanisms to finance\noperations and maintenance initially and to achieve full cost recovery over time. Part 2 of the TA\nwill be based on the findings of the BMRWMAP. The highest priority project that will be\ncost-effective for a specified desirable level of environmental benefits will be identified and a\nfeasibility analysis of the project will be carried out.\n14. The BMRWMAP study will develop a master planning and will provide sufficient\ninformation to enable formulation of conclusions and recommendations as to the optimal system\nof regional wastewater treatment and disposal facilities for BMR. The previous wastewater\nmanagement studies in BMR will be used as sources for the database for the BMRWMAP and\nfeasibility analysis and lessons learned from such studies as well as ongoing implementation of\nsimilar projects will be evaluated. The study will clearly identify the most economic and\ncost-effective regional system that will support urban and industrial growth in the BMR. The\nBMRWMAP will include sufficient analysis to indicate the general design criteria and magnitude\nof costs.\nC.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Arrangements\n15. The total cost of the TA is estimated as $985,000, comprising $530,000 equivalent\nin foreign exchange costs and $455,000 equivalent in local currency costs. All the foreign\nexchange costs and $70,000 in local currency equivalent amounting to $600,000 will be financed\nby the Bank. The Bank's financing will cover the remuneration, per diem, travel, transport, and\nother costs associated with the engagement of consultants. The remaining local currency costs\nof $385,000 equivalent will be financed by the Government and will cover remuneration of\ncounterpart staff and office accommodation, laboratory services, field surveys, and other local\nfacilities and services. The detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 1.\nD.\t Implementation Arrangements\n16. PCD will be the executing agency for the TA. The TA will be implemented over an\neight-month period. The executing agency will provide a project coordinator, full-time counterpart\nprofessionals totaling about 65 person-months, support staff, office space, and facilities. The\nexecuting agency will be responsible for coordinating, steering, and monitoring the counterpart\nactivities.", "5\n17. A Steering Committee, chaired by the Director General of PCD, will be formed to\nguide and review the results of the TA. The Steering Committee will include representatives of\nBMA, provincial governments in BMR, PCD, Ministry of Finance, and the Office of Environmental\nPolicy and Planning of MOSTE. PCD will arrange monthly review meetings to discuss progress\nand provide guidance to the consultants.\n18. The TA will be undertaken by consultants who will be selected in accordance with\nthe Bank's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. About 18 person-months of international\nconsultant services and about 10 person-months of domestic consultant services will be\nrequired. The international consultants will provide the team leader and expertise in the fields of\nwastewater management planning (8 person-months), environmental and social economics (4\nperson-months), urban infrastructure financial analysis (4 person-months), and corporate\nplanning and financial management (2 person-months). The domestic consultants will provide\na sanitary engineer acting as deputy team leader (8 person-months) and other fields of expertise\nas required. The outline terms of reference for the consulting services is in Appendix 2.\nProcurement of equipment by the Bank-financed consultants will be in accordance with\nprocedures satisfactory to the Bank.\n19. The Government's counterpart team will carry out the preparatory work, under\nthe direction of the PCD Director General. Prior to the fielding of the Bank consultants, the\ncounterpart team will assemble and review relevant reports; describe ongoing programs; review\nexisting regulations and guidelines; define jurisdictional and other logical geographic planning\nboundaries of subareas by similar waste load and flow characteristics; evaluate land use\ndevelopment including existing land use and planned land development; quantify domestic\nwastewater discharges and projections to match planned or likely development; review receiving\nwater quality and water quality objectives; review environmental conditions and predict future\nconditions with and without improved wastewater management; undertake socioeconomic,\nhealth, and attitude surreys; prepare geographic information system (GIS) base maps and\ndatabases by collating and reviewing available land maps, planning maps, and databases; and\nprepare to the extent possible, GIS base maps, and linked databases.\n20. The consultants will submit an inception report at the end of the first month after\nmobilization, an interim report describing the BMRWMAP after the fifth month, at which time a\nTA workshop will be held to discuss the report findings and recommendations, and a draft final\nreport describing the feasibility study of the priority project after the seventh month. Tripartite\nmeetings as necessary will be held among the Government, the Bank and the consultants to\ndiscuss the TA reports. A final report will be submitted one month after comments on the draft\nfinal report have been made by the Government and the Bank.\nIV. THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n21. The President, acting under the authority delegated to him by the Board, has\napproved the provision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, to the Government of Thailand\nin an amount not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 for the purpose of the Bangkok\nMetropolitan Region Wastewater Management Action Plan and Feasibility Study, and hereby\nreports his action to the Board.\nA.", "Appendix 1\nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN\nForeign\t Local\t Total\nExchange Currency\t Costs\nA.
