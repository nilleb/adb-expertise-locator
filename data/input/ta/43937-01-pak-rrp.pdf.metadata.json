THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto Zorlu Enerji Pakistan Limited (ZEPL) for the Zorlu Enerji Power Project in Pakistan.  \n \nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \nA.  Project Identification and Selection \n2.  Pakistan\u2019s energy generation is highly dependent on imported fossil fuels. The country \nimports some $10.5 billion worth of oil each year, the bulk of which is for electricity generation. \nThis  is  equivalent  to  about  34%  of  total  imports,  imposing  a  significant  burden  on  the \nGovernment of Pakistan\u2019s scarce foreign exchange reserves and making the country extremely \nvulnerable to energy supply disruptions and global price fluctuations.1 The situation will worsen \nas Pakistan\u2019s main Sui gas reservoir will fully deplete in 2012, causing over half of all thermal \npower plants at that time to switch to imported oil-based fuel for base load generation. At the \nsame time, Pakistan is endowed with abundant renewable energy resources\u2014wind, mini-hydro \n(less than 50 MW), solar, and biomass. Accordingly, tapping the vast potential of renewable \nenergy, especially wind, is of critical urgency to diversify the skewed fuel mix, hence ensuring \nenergy security, saving precious foreign exchange, and enhancing macroeconomic stability by \nhelping to protect against global price fluctuations.  \n \n3.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  building  on  strong  Central  and  West  Asia \nDepartment support to the Alternative Energy Development Board (AEDB), has been working \nclosely with this institution to identify potential wind independent power producers (IPPs) that \nmatch ADB\u2019s priorities for renewable energy power development in Pakistan. ADB has been \nactively  engaged  with  several  sponsors  who  are  trying  to  develop  viable  wind  projects  in \nPakistan, including the project sponsors, for more than 2 years. The project\u2019s concept review \nwas approved by the ADB Investment Committee in August 2009, and due diligence missions \nwere fielded in November 2009 and in February and August 2010. The project is expected to \nachieve financial close by the end of December 2010. \n \nB.  Sector Background \n1.  Electricity: Demand and Supply Gap \n4.  Pakistan\u2019s power sector faces a major supply deficit, constraining the country\u2019s already \nfragile economic growth. Peak demand was 18,926 MW in mid-2010, but the country had only \n14,723 MW in firm supplies, resulting in a shortfall of 4,203 MW (or 22.2% of the country\u2019s peak \nelectricity demand).2 As of June 2010, the country\u2019s installed power generation capacity was \n20,375 MW, of which about 55% was owned and operated by government entities and 45% by \nIPPs and/or majority private sector led operators. Thermal power plants, with almost 52% based \non imported fuel oil and the balance on gas, account for 68% of installed capacity; hydro plants \naccount for 30%, and nuclear plants provide the remaining 2%.   \n \n                                                 \n1  Government  of  Pakistan,  Federal  Bureau  of  Statistics.  http://www.statpak.gov.pk;  State  Bank  of  Pakistan. \nhttp://www.sbp.org.pk/stats.  \n2  National Power Control Center daily log report dated 30 June 2010 and Karachi Electric Supply Company load \ndispatch center report date 30 June 2010.   \n \n ", "2   \n5.  While electricity sales and demand have risen by over 40% during the last 5 years, \ninvestment in new generation capacity has lagged. The resultant power shortage has led to \nincreasing incidents of brownouts and blackouts in all major urban centers. Measures to ration \nconsumption are being taken, such as forcing\u2014often through law enforcement agencies\u2014\nshops and industries to close early. Left unattended, the country\u2019s power deficit will worsen and \naffect Pakistan\u2019s economy even more adversely. Given the acute current power shortage, even \na likely slowdown in economic growth during the next few years will not change the imperative \nfor more power generation. Hence, the addition of domestic resource-based power generation \ncapacity is a matter of utmost national urgency (details on Pakistan\u2019s power sector are in \nSupplementary Appendix B). \n \n  2.  Government of Pakistan Response \n \n6.  To address the energy shortage and growing power crisis, the government has decided \nto  implement  a  number  of  energy  expansion  initiatives.  These  include  new  or  expanded \ngeneration by thermal and hydro IPPs under the 2002 Power Policy, procuring power from \nrental power plants under short-term agreements, securing electricity and gas imports from \nregional  projects,  as  well  as  tapping  the  huge  potential  renewable  energy  sources.  The \ngovernment is also exploring the possibility of utilizing its domestic coal reserves\u2014one of the \nlargest (albeit low quality and remotely located) in the world\u2014for power generation. However, \nthe time horizon for domestic coal-fired power generation is long-term. In the short to medium \nterm, it is expected that conventional (i.e., thermal), hydro, and wind energy will be mainstays of \nPakistan\u2019s  electricity  supply.  The  medium-term  development  framework  (MTDF)\u2014the \ngovernment\u2019s core planning document for 2005\u20132010\u2014states that renewable energy should \nconstitute 6% (or 9,700 MW) of the country\u2019s energy mix by 2030. During the same period, it \nforecasts that the private sector will own and operate the majority of this renewable-energy-\nbased generation capacity.  \n \n  3.  Private Sector Investment in Pakistan \n \n7.  Pakistan has undertaken wide-ranging reforms in the power sector with the assistance of \nADB and the World Bank since the mid-1990s. This work is not yet completed and various \nchallenges  remain.  During  the  past  2  years,  nine  IPPs  representing  almost  2,000  MW  of \ninstalled capacity have achieved financial close under the 2002 Power Policy. Most have been \ncommissioned and all are expected to begin commercial operation by the end of 2010 or early \n2011. ADB has taken a lead in supporting the government\u2019s initiative to attract private capital \ninto the power sector and has been instrumental in many pioneering transactions. ADB financed \nthe first private sector run-of-river hydro project, the New Bong Escape Hydropower Project.3 \nThis transaction has set the precedent for many follow-up private hydro projects, several of \nwhich ADB is currently engaged in. ADB has also invested (equity and a partial commercial \nguarantee) in a gas-fired combined cycle power, the Daharki Power Company Limited, using \ndomestic gas.4 ADB is processing proposed financial assistance for a 400 MW expansion of a \nsimilar gas-fired combined cycle power plant. To encourage investment in the power sector, the \ngovernment has undertaken steps to privatize state-owned power entities\u2014both generation \nplants and power utilities. ADB assisted the government in privatizing the Karachi Electric \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2005.

Wind Sector: Key Players and Policy Framework \n \n8.  Noting  international  and  regional  (especially  India\u2019s)  experience,  the  government \nestablished the AEDB in 2003 with the support of ADB to encourage development of renewable \nenergy in the country .6 Pakistan has substantial wind resources\u2014an estimated 50,000 MW is \navailable in southern Pakistan alone.7 In 2004, the AEDB invited private investors to set up wind \nfarms and several letters of intent were issued to eligible potential investors, most of them local. \nHowever, the projects were not able to move forward because of lack of required experience \namong  this  initial  investor  group  and  the  perceived  higher  risk  in  this  new  sector.  The \ngovernment realized that, if it was to encourage participation in the new sector by both foreign \nand local private sector investors, it needed to pass policies targeted at the renewable energy \nsector.  In  2006,  the  government  released  a  formal  policy  for  renewable  energy  power \ngeneration, covering wind power as well as other renewable technologies such as solar and \nsmall scale hydro. In line with other policies, such as those for thermal and larger-scale hydro, \nthe Renewable Energy Policy lays down incentives to attract domestic and foreign capital into \nrenewable energy power generation. These include exemptions from customs duty or sales tax \nfor  machinery  imports,  exemption  from  income  taxes  and  withholding  tax  on  imports, \nguaranteed rate of return of 17% in US dollar terms on equity (rather than the 15% allowed for \nthermal  power  projects),  repatriation  of  equity  along  with  dividends  without  incurring  any \nadditional penalties, and flexibility in the mode and currency of financing. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 \n9.  The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020,8 which emphasizes ADB\u2019s support \nfor environmentally sustainable infrastructure projects and private sector development. The \nstrategy seeks to meet the region\u2019s growing energy demand by helping ADB members to \ndevelop their economies using environmentally friendly technologies, specifically addressing \nenergy efficiency and expanding the use of clean energy sources. The strategy also aims to \npromote a larger role for the private sector in financing infrastructure by supporting public\u2013\nprivate partnerships.  \n   \n2.  Consistency with the Country Strategy \n10.  ADB\u2019s support for the project is in line with Pakistan\u2019s country partnership strategy \n(CPS), 2009\u201320139 and the government\u2019s strategic emphasis on energy sector development. \n\u201cADB  views  itself  as  one  of  Pakistan\u2019s  strategic  development  partners  for  infrastructure \ndevelopment,\u201d with power as one of the main areas of support, and \u201cthe emphasis on lending for \neconomic infrastructure will be continued, which is consistent with the high priority attached to it \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2007.

Manila. \n ", "4   \nin the Government\u2019s MTDF.\u201d10 The proposed project also conforms to the crosscutting theme of \nsustainable environmental management as reflected in the CPS. Lastly, the CPS mandates \nADB to develop greater complimentarity between its public and private sector operations. It \nplaces specific emphasis on the role of the private sector as a driver of investment, growth, and \nemployment. Among the focus sectors of ADB\u2019s private sector operations, power and energy \ninfrastructure feature prominently. \n \n3.  Consistency with the Energy Sector Strategy \n11.  ADB\u2019s  Energy  Policy  identifies  renewable  energy  generation  as  a  key  priority  and \nrequires ADB to place greater focus on meeting energy security and a transition to a low-carbon \neconomy. 11ADB also seeks to help its members provide reliable, sufficient, and affordable \nenergy supplies for inclusive growth in a socially, economically, and environmentally sustainable \nway. ADB applies three pillars for policy implementation: (i) promoting energy efficiency and \nrenewable energy; (ii) maximizing access to energy for all; and (iii) promoting energy sector \nreform, capacity building, and governance. The project (as a precedent setter) will generate \nrenewable-energy-based power in an economically and environmentally sustainable manner. \nThe project also promotes energy efficiency with advanced and cleaner technologies, and will \nhelp ADB to meet its commitment under the policy to undertake clean energy investments of \n$2 billion per year from 2013 ($1 billion per annum until then). \n \nIII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Description \n1.  The Borrower/Sponsor \n12.  The project is being developed by ZEPL (the borrower), a special purpose company \nincorporated under the laws of Pakistan with 100% shareholding from Zorlu Enerji Elektrik \n\u00dcretim. (Zorlu Enerji, the sponsor)\u2014a Turkish joint stock company established in 1993 to meet \nthe electricity and steam needs of the Zorlu group (one of the largest industrial conglomerates in \nTurkey). Zorlu Enerji has almost 460 MW of generation currently under operation (making it one \nof the largest private sector generation companies in Turkey). Zorlu Enerji also has expertise in \nthe development and operation of wind power projects, having developed Turkey\u2019s largest wind \nfarm\u2014the 135 MW Osmaniye Rotor plant, which was financed by the International Finance \nCorporation (IFC) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and \nstarted commercial operations in mid-2010.  \n \n13.  Zorlu Holding,  Zorlu Enerji\u2019s parent company, was established in the 1990s and is one \nof the largest private sector conglomerates in Turkey.  Zorlu Holding\u2019s activities are divided into \nvarious subgroups: (i) textiles, with interests in production and marketing of yarn and home \ntextiles; (ii) energy, with interests primarily in power and energy, power project construction, and \npower project operation and maintenance (O&M); and (iii) various companies covering aviation, \ninsurance, information technology, real estate, and tourism.  \n \n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2005.

The project is located close to Jhimpir town in Thatta district in southern Sindh, about \n100  kilometers  (km)  northeast  of  Karachi\u2014Pakistan\u2019s  commercial  and  industrial  hub.  The \nproject, which will be spread over about 5 square kilometers, encompasses engineering, design, \nprocurement, construction, turbine erection, grid tie-in, commissioning, and O&M of a 56.4 MW \nwind power plant. The project\u2019s civil works include turbine (tower) foundations, substation and \ntransformer foundations, and related works. Power evacuation from the project to the national \ngrid will be through a 132 kilovolt (kV) line, built and operated by the National Transmission and \nDispatch Company (NTDC), the national grid operator. Power offtake arrangements include a \n20-year take-or-pay energy purchase agreement (EPA) between the NTDC (through its Central \nPower Purchasing Authority [CPPA]) and ZEPL. The government will guarantee the NTDC\u2019s \nobligations under the EPA as part of its obligations under the implementation agreement (IA) for \na period of 20 years. The government will also bear the wind availability risk as stated in the \nRenewable Energy Policy .12 \n \n3.  Project Outputs and Outcome \n15.  The project\u2019s output will be a 56.4 MW privately owned and financed wind power project. \nThe  project  will  contribute  to  the  creation  of  employment  opportunities  and  stimulation  of \neconomic growth in southern Sindh, one of the poorest regions in Pakistan, and an area of \nparticular development and poverty-alleviation concern to ADB.13  \n \n16.  The project\u2019s outcome will be the provision of competitively priced and low carbon power \nto  Pakistan\u2019s  consumers,  with  adequate  returns  generated  for  the  project\u2019s  investors.  The \nproject will also help reduce the country\u2019s carbon footprint. The amount of carbon dioxide \nemissions  reduced  is  one  of  the  project  indicators,  in  addition  to  the  usual  financial  and \noperational indicators. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n   \nB.  Development Impact \n1.  Contribution to Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction \n17.  By providing much needed power to a country facing severe power shortage, which is \nadversely affecting economic growth, the project has direct and indirect benefits. The project will \nincrementally increase access to energy for households, business, and industry. It will alleviate \npoverty through skilled and unskilled job creation and other associated economic activities. \nPakistan\u2019s energy mix, which is highly dependent on imported oil (with its price uncertainty), will \nbe diversified by the addition of incremental renewable energy capacity through the project, as \nwell as through its anticipated replication. The project will also help realize the government\u2019s \ntarget of 6% renewable energy in the country\u2019s energy mix by 2030, as stated in the MTDF. The \nproject by using renewable source of wind energy will diversify the fuel mix of the power sector \nin Pakistan away from its current heavy dependence on the fossil fuels. The fossil fuels have \nseen escalation and volatility in their prices in recent years, which has put pressure on the \nfinancial  health  of  the  power  sector  of  Pakistan.  The  diversification  of  the  fuel  mix  using \nindigenous and renewable source of power is an important element in helping address the long \nterm financial health and the circular debt of the Pakistan power sector. \n                                                 \n12  This is similar to the water availability risk that the government bears for hydropower projects under the Power \nPolicy, 2002. \n13 ADB. 2006.

The project, being the first privately owned and financed wind project in Pakistan, will \ncatalyze  private  sector  investment  in  Pakistan\u2019s  renewable  energy  sector  as  it  provides  a \nsuccessful template for follow-on projects. The success of this project sends an important signal \nto the markets that Pakistan\u2019s power sector, especially wind IPPs, is attractive for private sector \ninvestment and financing. A number of other proposed wind projects are closely watching the \nprogress of the project and can be expected to follow the success of Zorlu (some of them with \nADB support), which will open up the wind power sector in Pakistan. Considering the country\u2019s \nsubstantial wind resources, wind power can address part of the long-term needs of the power \nsector in Pakistan. \n \n19.  ADB has been a major development partner in Pakistan\u2019s energy sector. Although the \nreform process in the sector has been challenging, considerable progress has been made with \nADB assistance in creating an enabling environment for future investments and promoting \nprivate sector participation. ADB is assisting the government in the implementation of reforms, \nsector analysis, capacity development, and project identification and development. Over the \nmedium  term,  ADB  is  supporting  large  infrastructure  projects  in  renewable  energy,  power \ntransmission,  distribution,  and  energy  efficiency.14 ADB  has  supported  several  power  and \nenergy sector projects in Pakistan through loans and investments since 1995: Fauji Kabirwala\u2014\n151 MW gas-fired combined cycle power plant;15  Daharki Power\u2014171 MW gas-fired combined \ncycle power plant (footnote 5); Karachi Electricity Supply Corporation\u2019s Expansion Program\u2014\nfirst utility deregulation (footnote 5); and the New Bong Escape\u2014first hydro IPP, 84 MW run-of-\nthe-river hydropower plant (footnote 3).  \n \n3.  Economic Sustainability \n20.   The project\u2019s economic benefits include the value of power as an input to economic \nactivity and the environmental advantage of clean energy. The project will also help improve \nenergy security by developing an indigenous and renewable energy source. Since Pakistan \nfaces a power supply deficit, the electricity generated from the project is considered to meet \nunmet demand (i.e., not substituting power from existing generation capacity) and the entire \nplant\u2019s output is considered incremental. The economic costs include capital, labor, and O&M \ncosts. The calculated economic internal rate of return is 14.7%, higher than the social discount \nrate of 10%.16 The economic analysis is in Appendix 3.  \n \n                                                 \n14 ADB. 2006.

Environment and Social Dimensions   \n1.  Environment \n23.  The environmental assessment was carried out in line with the national regulations and \nADB and IFC safeguard policies. The project is classified category B for the environment under \nADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  and  an  initial  environmental  examination  was \ntherefore required. The initial environmental examination has identified impacts that may arise, \nand mitigation measures have been identified. Short-term impacts\u2014including soil erosion and \ncontamination,  air  quality  deterioration,  noise,  and  safety  hazards\u2014are  anticipated  mostly \nduring the construction period. Impacts during wind farm operation include aesthetics impacts \nand bird mortality. Considerations to minimize the net impact of the project development works \nhave been incorporated throughout the life cycle of the project from design, commissioning, and \noperations. ZEPL designed an environmental management plan with organizational structure, \nroles  and  responsibilities,  mitigation  plan,  monitoring  plan,  change  management  plan, \ncommunication and documentation, and environmental training defined to ensure that all the \nmitigation measures and guidelines recommended for the project in the initial environmental \nexamination  will  be  adhered  to.  An  audit  of  the  existing  6  MW  has  been  carried  out  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). Public consultations were made in \nand around the project area to ascertain opinions concerning wind farm in the area; attitudes to \nspecific  aspects  of  wind  energy,  including  visual,  environmental,  social,  and  economic \ndimensions; and acceptance of wind farms at the local level. The overall results of the public \nconsultations  are  encouraging,  with  stakeholders  generally  very  positive  toward  the \ndevelopment of the wind farm in the area.  \n \n2.  Social Dimensions \n24.   The proposed wind farm is on 4.65 km2 of flat, rocky, and barren land located close to \nJhimpir town, Thatta district in Sindh province. The AEDB acquired the land for the project from \nthe government of Sindh and it will be leased to ZEPL for the duration of the EPA. Since the site \nis close to the Arabian Sea, the area is hot and humid with very low precipitation and is \ntherefore not suitable for cultivation. Since basic amenities are not available in the area, most of \nthe local population resides in nearby villages (more than 3 km from the project site) where \nbetter educational, health, and commercial facilities are available. The land identified as the \nproject site does not belong to any tribal group nor is it being claimed as ancestral domain. \nPeople residing in the nearby villages graze their cattle in the project area during summer when \nthere is enough rain to allow for grazing of their animals. Since the boundary of the project area \nwill not be fenced, the local population will continue to use the area as grazing ground for cattle. \nThe project is classified category C for involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples under \nthe ADB Safeguard Policy Statement.  \n \n25.   The project will offer some employment opportunities for local villagers, primarily during \nthe construction phase. It will have a relatively short construction period, and will require some \nskilled and semi-skilled workers, including crane and heavy equipment operators, engineers, \nelectricians, electronic technicians, mechanical technicians, concrete workers, and laborers. \nThe balance-of-plant contractor will accommodate as much local labor as possible from the \nlocal area. A total of 437 workers are expected to be employed till project completion. The \n ", "8   \nbalance-of-plant construction contractor will be required to comply with core labor standards.17 \nThe summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n26.  The key project contracts include an EPA with the power purchaser, NTDC (through the \nCPPA); an IA with the government; a balance-of-plant contract; a turbine supply agreement; and \nan O&M agreement. Overall responsibility for day-to-day management is assigned to the Zorlu \nEnerji project development team.  \n \n1.  Power Offtake and Evacuation \n27.  Power from the project will be sold to the NTDC (through the CPPA) under a 20-year \nEPA in accordance with the tariff to be approved by NEPRA. The NEPRA-approved tariff takes \ninto account the plant factor, project cost, power curves, O&M arrangements, inflation, and \ntargeted rate of return on equity as well as cost of borrowing (both US dollar and Pakistan rupee \ntranches).  Power  evacuation  from  the  complex,  which  is  the  responsibility  of  the  power \npurchaser, will be via a 132 kV transmission line that has already been built and is operated by \nthe NTDC.  \n \n2.  Plant Engineering, Procurement, and Construction \n28.  Engineering, procurement, and civil works (EPC) for the project is governed by three \nseparate agreements: (i) the phase 1 EPC contract; (ii) the turbine supply agreement; and (iii) a \nbalance-of-plant contract. All contracts will be verified by lenders\u2019 technical and legal advisers to \nensure economy, value for money, efficiency, and competitiveness in the implementation of the \nproject. \n \n3.  Operation and Maintenance \n29.  ZEPL will enter into an O&M contract for 20 years. The lenders\u2019 technical advisers will \nconfirm that the cost of the executed O&M agreement is in line with the approved O&M tariff \ncomponent and, together with lenders\u2019 legal advisers, will confirm that the O&M contract will \ncontain adequate plant availability guarantees so that economy, value for money, efficiency, and \ncompetitiveness is maintained in the contract. \n \n4.  Government Implementation Agreement and Guarantee \n30.  Upon  execution  of  the  EPA,  ZEPL  will  sign  an  IA  with  the  government.  The \nimplementation agreement provides assurance of support from the government for development \nof the project in a timely and efficient manner. It also sets out various government commitments \nto the project that are standard for IPPs (both thermal and hydro) in Pakistan under the various \npower policies. These include various tax and customs concessions; government support in \nobtaining all necessary approvals and consents; the right to open and operate bank accounts in \nPakistan and abroad; guaranteed availability of foreign exchange for remittance of dividends, \n                                                 \n17 The core labor standards are a set of four internationally recognized basic rights and principles at work: (i) freedom \nof association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining, (ii) elimination of all forms of forced \nor compulsory labor, (iii) effective abolition of child labor, and (iv) elimination of discrimination in respect of \nemployment and occupation. Pakistan has ratified all International Labour Organization fundamental conventions \ncovering the four core labor standards. These are embodied in the Constitution and the Industrial Relations \nOrdinance of 2002. \n ", "        9\ndebt  servicing,  and  other  project  activities;  assurances  against  discriminatory  government \naction, including prohibition on compulsory acquisition of assets and shares; special protection \nagainst risks of political force majeure and change in law; commitments by the government to \npay  compensation  in  the  event  of  a  transfer  of  the  project  following  termination  of  the \nimplementation agreement; and final resolution of disputes by means of arbitration under the \nrules of the International Chamber of Commerce. Under the implementation agreement, the \ngovernment also agrees to enter into a separate guarantee of the payment obligations of the \nNTDC under the EPA. Since the wind availability risk is covered in the calculation of the tariff \nunder  the  EPA  (in  accordance  with  the  Renewable  Energy  Policy),  this  risk  is  effectively \nguaranteed by the government under the IA. The project therefore bears the plant availability \nrisk18 and this risk will be further mitigated under the project contracts.  \n \n5.  Insurance Arrangements \n31.  ZEPL will take out the necessary insurance to cover essential risks for (i) the supply and \ntransportation  of  turbines  and  machinery;  (ii)  turbine  erection  and  plant  construction;  and \n(iii) once commercial operations commence, business interruption. The insurance package will \nbe designed to maximize cover for all possible insurable risks. Because of the size of the project \nand the limited capacity in the local insurance market, it is expected that a major portion of the \ninsurance will be placed with reputable insurers in the international market.  \n \n6.  Anticorruption Policy  \n32.  ZEPL and Zorlu Enerji were advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended \nto date) and the Policy on Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism (2003). \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will \nrequire ZEPL to institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls following \ninternational  best  practice  standards  for  the  purpose  of  preventing  corruption  or  money \nlaundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism  and  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from \nengaging in such activities. The investment documentation between ADB and ZEPL will further \nallow ADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these undertakings.  \n \n7.  Project Performance Monitoring, Reporting, and Evaluation \n33.  ZEPL  will  be  required  to  submit  quarterly  unaudited  financial  statements,  quarterly \noperations reports (including contractor and construction reports before the project achieves its \ncommercial operations date), annual business plans and budgets to ADB and other lenders, \nand must report any material changes. ZEPL will be required to hire an internationally reputable \naccounting firm  (or  its local  affiliate)  to  audit its  annual accounts  in  line  with international \nfinancial  reporting  standards.  ADB  will  monitor  the  project  against  its  business  plans  and \noperational budgets, using information from its sources, lender\u2019s advisers, and from government \ncounterparts. The project will be evaluated on three levels: (i) project completion, successful \ncommissioning,  and  its  satisfactory  operation;  (ii)  increase  in  Pakistan\u2019s  private  power \ngeneration capacity and wind power generation capacity in particular; and (iii) reduction in \ncarbon  emissions.  The  performance  indicators  are  included  in  the  design  and  monitoring \nframework (Appendix 1).  \n \n                                                 \n18 The availability factor is the measurement of the reliability of a wind turbine or other power plant and refers to the \npercentage of time that a plant is ready to generate (i.e., not out of service for maintenance or repairs). Modern \nwind turbines have an availability of more than 95%\u2014higher than most other types of power plant. After 2 decades \nof constant engineering refinement, today\u2019s wind machines are considered highly reliable.  \n ", "10   \nIV.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n34.  The sponsors and government authorities greatly value ADB\u2019s support for this project \nand for the renewable energy and power sector in general. ADB has played a key role for this \ntransaction in getting the financial consortium together and has been working closely with the \nsponsor for a long time. The sponsor appreciates that ADB\u2019s presence enhanced the project\u2019s \nability to mobilize financing that might otherwise be unavailable for a project of this nature in \nPakistan  in  today\u2019s  challenging  market.  The  proposed  loan  of  up  to  $36.8  million  will  be \nprovided from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources without government guarantee.  \n \nB.  Justification for ADB Assistance \n35.  The proposed loan merits ADB\u2019s support for the following reasons: \n \n(i)  The project, being the first privately financed wind project in Pakistan, sets an \nimportant precedent and provides a bankable template for future wind projects in \nthe country. It is estimated that three to five projects in the wind sector can be \nexpected  to  achieve  financial  close  and  hence  come  online  following  ADB \nsupport to this project. This trend is consistent with the one observed after the \nADB-supported New Bong Escape Project (Pakistan\u2019s first hydro IPP) achieved \nits financial close in December 2009, wherein a number of hydro projects have \nregenerated developer interest and one is nearing financial close (with ADB \nsupport). \n \n(ii)  ADB is providing financing to a critical power sector asset, a sector that does not \nreadily have access to long-term funding. ADB\u2019s assistance to the project will \nhelp increase the incremental supply of energy to reduce a growing power deficit, \nwhich has seriously constrained economic growth. It will also increase access to \nenergy for households, business, and industry. \n \n(iii)  The presence of ADB reassures the sponsors that the government entities will \ncontinue to support this project throughout its life. Given its track record in the \ncountry and in the sector, ADB was the first financial institution that the sponsors \napproached to finance the project. The sponsors value the risk mitigation and the \nfinancial catalyst role that ADB has played in supporting private sector projects in \nPakistan;  this  affirms  ADB\u2019s  status  as  the  preferred  partner  of  choice  in \nundertaking any privately financed infrastructure project in the country. \n \n(iv)  The project makes efficient use of an energy resource that is domestic, idle, and \nrenewable;  and  reduces  reliance  on  expensive  oil  imports,  which  have \ncontributed  to  extreme  stress  on  Pakistan\u2019s  foreign  exchange  reserves.  It \ncontributes directly to Pakistan\u2019s energy security through diversification of the \npower  mix  and  supports  the  government\u2019s  target  of  having  6%  of  power \ngeneration from renewable energy sources by 2030. \n \n(v)  The project helps improve the country\u2019s environment by reducing greenhouse \ngas emissions and pollutants such as sulfur dioxide and nitric acid, by lessening \nthe need to construct or rent (imported) fossil-based power generation capacity \nto meet demand. The project will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by about \n ", "        11\n86,024 tons of carbon dioxide (CO ) per year and about 1.72 million tons of CO  \n2 2\nduring the 20 years of operation. \n \n(vi)  As part of its public sector program, ADB has a strong energy focus in Pakistan. \nIts work on the enabling environment, reform, and regulations has helped create \nthe right conditions for further private and public sector investment. ADB is also \nthe largest renewable energy sector assistance provider to the country under its \nRenewable Energy Development Sector Investment Program.19 Support to the \nproject will directly build on and complement extensive work undertaken under \nthe investment program in promoting renewable energy in Pakistan. \n \n(vii)  The project will contribute toward creating employment opportunities, stimulating \neconomic growth, and developing infrastructure in southern Sindh, considered \none of the poorest regions in Pakistan and in particular need of development. \n \n(viii)  The  project  remains  fully  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Energy  Policy,  under  which \nsupport to renewable energy generation is identified as a key priority. The project \nwill also help meet ADB\u2019s commitment of clean energy investments of $2 billion \nper year from 2013 (and $1 billion per annum until that date). Furthermore, the \nproject is fully consistent with both Strategy 2020 and the Pakistan CPS. \n \n \nC.  Assurances \n36.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \nGovernment of Pakistan will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed \nassistance to Zorlu Enerji Pakistan Limited. No funding will be disbursed until ADB receives \nsuch confirmation. ADB will enter into suitable finance documentation, in form and substance \nsatisfactory to ADB, following approval of the proposed assistance by the Board of Directors. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n37.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan of up to \n$36,800,000 to Zorlu Enerji Pakistan Limited for the Zorlu Enerji Power Project from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined based on the procedures applicable to \nADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based loans for nonsovereign operations; and \nsuch other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in this \nreport, and as may be reported to the Board. \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n \n24 November 2010 \n                                                 \n19 ADB. 2006.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nExpensive and unreliable energy sources are restricting investments and hampering sustainable economic growth in \nPakistan. The Pakistan country partnership strategy (CPS)a focuses on supporting energy sector reforms; capacity \ndevelopment  for  key  agencies  in  the  energy  sector;  and  investing  in  supply-side  activities,  including  power \ngeneration, transmission, and distribution and system enhancement. The CPS also identifies clean energy as one of \nthe key drivers of the strategy and the private sector as playing a key role in expanding private sector operations in \nthe renewable energy sector. The project will involve the construction, erection, and operation of a wind farm that is \nin line with the CPS targets to support power generation using clean energy sources. The project will help to ease \nreliance on imported fuel for power generation, resulting in foreign exchange savings for the country. Availability of \nreliable power from renewable sources is expected to increase investments in businesses, which will generate more \njobs and other income-earning opportunities for the local population.   \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                          Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \n1.  Key issues. During the construction stage, the project is expected to generate employment opportunities that can \nbe tapped by qualified local laborers. During operations, the project will provide additional supply of clean energy \nsource to the national grid. The local people, commerce, and industry will benefit from this additional power source\u2014\nsignificantly increasing productivity. The enhanced economic activities will have a direct impact on Pakistan\u2019s poverty \nreduction initiatives.  \n \n2. Design features. The project entails the construction and operation of a wind farm, an additional power source to \nsupport the country\u2019s energy demand. Being clean and renewable and not dependent on burning fossil fuel, it is \nexpected to contribute in abating the impact of climate change, which often disproportionately affects the poor and \nvulnerable.  \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA. Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nLand acquisition and resettlement.  The wind towers will be constructed on 4.65 km2 of flat, rocky, and barren \nland. Because of its very low precipitation and its location close to the Arabian Sea, the land is unsuitable for \nagriculture. The nearest community or village where basic amenities are present can be found 3 kilometers (km) from \nthe project site. The Alternative Energy Development Board acquired the land from the government of Sindh on a \nlong-term  lease  that  has  been  re-leased  to  the  project  for  its  duration.  The  project  is  classified  involuntary \nresettlement category C under the ADB Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).  \n \nIndigenous peoples. No people or groups in the project area will be affected by the project construction and \noperation. The project is classified indigenous peoples category C under the ADB Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \nLabor. The project will offer limited employment opportunities. During the preconstruction phase (phase 1), 137 were \nemployed (including 22 locals hired directly). During project construction (phase 2), 300 persons will be employed.  \n \n ", " 14  Appendix 2 \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nThe consultation and participation process for the project involved the following stakeholders: host communities \n(about 16 villages located 3 km\u20136 km from the project site); elected representatives of the area; nongovernment \norganizations (national and international) working in the area; environmental protection agency officials; other nearby \ncommunities; suppliers, traders, and service providers in the project area; among others. The process adopted an \ninteractive and participatory approach, ensuring that each participant expressed their opinions openly on the \nproposed wind farm in the project area. A total of 112 consultations and meetings were held and data collected from \nall these were analyzed. Extra efforts were made to maximize women\u2019s participation during the process. Separate \nconsultations with women were undertaken by a dedicated female consultant. In general, the communities consulted \nexpressed support for the project as they thought that the establishment of the wind farm would develop the area and \ngive them access to better civic amenities. They also expressed apprehension about an influx of migrant workers \nand that were concerned that these workers would replace them over time. Details of the discussions on issues, \nexpectations, apprehensions, and possible outcomes from the proposed wind farm are incorporated in the EIA \nreport. \n  \nA grievance redress system will be implemented, under which the project will maintain a social complaint register at \nthe site to document all complaints received from the local communities. The information recorded in the register will \ninclude the date of the complaint, particulars of the complainant, a description of the grievance, actions to be taken, \nthe person responsible for taking action, follow-up requirements, and the target date for implementation of the \nmitigation measure. The register will also record the actual measures taken to mitigate these concerns.  \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring? \n  \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No   \n \nConsultation and participation activities are integrated into the environment and social documentation, including the \nenvironmental impact assessment report. \nC.   Gender and Development \nKey issues. The public consultation undertaken by the project noted that women in the vicinity are engaged in \nlivestock rearing and a small number also work as laborers. No adverse social impacts from project activities are \nforeseen for the following reasons: (i) locals will be employed, especially for semi-skilled and unskilled labor, to avoid \ncausing social stress\u2014particularly to women and children; (ii) the project is located in vacant and barren land with no \nevidence of sustained farming activities and therefore no impacts on livelihoods; (iii) the wind farm will not be fenced, \nso livestock herding will not be materially affected; and (iv) the nearest village is about 3km away and noise and dust \ngenerated during construction and operation is not expected to be a major issue. \n \nOnce the wind farm is operational and has started generating electricity, some indirect gender benefits are expected.  \nExpected indirect benefits include increased productive working hours because of the availability of electricity in the \nevening, improved education for children who can continue studying in the evening, better health outcomes for \nwomen and children, and reduced time devoted by women to domestic chores and caring for sick family members\u2014\nthereby increasing women\u2019s time for income generation and/or leisure activities. On providing employment to \nqualified women during the construction and operation of the project, the project company and the construction \ncontractors will have to comply with core labor standards to ensure that women are not discriminated against in \nemployment opportunities, salaries, and benefits packages. \n \nKey actions.

Introduction \n \n1.  The project is the first private wind farm in Pakistan. It is a 56.4 megawatt (MW) wind power \nplant close to Jhimpir town in Thatta district, southern Sindh, about 100 kilometers (km) northeast of \nKarachi.  \n \n2.  As of mid-2010, Pakistan had a shortfall of 22% (4,200 MW) of the country\u2019s peak demand.  \nWhile electricity sales and demand have risen by over 40% since 2005, investment in new generation \nhas lagged. The extent of power outages all over the country, including major urban areas, has \nbecome  a  significant  bottleneck  to  growth.  Energy  security  is  further  compromised  by  a  50% \ndependence on imported oil. Global price fluctuations threaten the already scarce energy supply. \n \n3.  The Government of Pakistan implemented initiatives to expand energy supply and encourage \nrenewable  energy.  In  2004,  the  Alternative  Energy  Development  Board  (AEDB)  invited  private \ninvestors to set up wind farms but the sector has not developed for a variety of reasons. The \ngovernment has since established other incentives for investors in renewable energy. The success of \nthis project is expected to provide lessons for other investors who are considering investing in \nPakistan\u2019s renewable energy sector. \n \nB.  Valuation of Economic Benefits and Costs  \n \n4.  The economic analysis for the project was conducted in accordance with the Guidelines for \nthe  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).20 The  values  in  the \neconomic analysis reflect 2010 price levels, and the exchange rate assumed is PRs85.6 per $1. This \neconomic analysis is carried out using the domestic price numeraire. The economic internal rate of \nreturn (EIRR) is calculated from the year of construction to the expected end of the project life (2010\u2013\n2032). Assumptions on macroeconomic variables and operations are consistent with the financial \nevaluation. \n1.  Economic Benefits \n5.  The two quantifiable benefits from this project are the value of power as an input to economic \nactivity, and the environmental advantage of clean energy.   \n \n6.  With Pakistan\u2019s energy supply deficit, the power produced by the plant is not expected to \nsubstitute  the  existing  generation  capacity,  thus  the  entire  output  of  the  plant  is  considered \nincremental. The price of incremental power is in the tariff set by the regulator. This represents the \nvalue of power as an input to economic activity. \n \n7.  The environmental advantage of clean energy is valued using an estimate of the traded price \nof  certified  emission  reduction  (CER)  of  the  Clean  Development  Mechanism.  The  CER  price \nrepresents society\u2019s willingness to pay for cleaner energy, and is quoted per ton of carbon dioxide \n(tCO ) avoided. This price is assumed at \u20ac10 (PRs1, 155) per tCO .  \n2 2\n \n8.  As this project is pioneering wind power in Pakistan, its successful implementation will result \nin lessons that will help facilitate subsequent renewable energy investments in the country. However, \n                                                 \n20  ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.

Capital and operating costs exclude interest during construction, fees and taxes, and financing \ncosts.  The  tradable  component  of  the  capital  and  operating  costs  are  adjusted  for  a  shadow \nexchange rate factor of 1.1. The capital cost includes the present value of the cost of the 6 MW of \nwind power that is already installed.    \n \nC.    Calculation of Economic Internal Rate of Return  \n10.  The real EIRR of 14.7% exceeds the social discount rate of 10% (Table A4.1).21 \n \n                                                 \n21  Multilateral  Development  Banks,  Evaluation  Cooperation  Group.  2006.
