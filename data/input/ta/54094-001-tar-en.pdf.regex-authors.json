INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The  proposed  knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA)  aims  to  provide \ninstitutional support to the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) and its wholly owned \ninternational subsidiary-NPCI International Payments Limited (NIPL) in accelerating adoption of \ndigital payments and promoting financial technology (fintech)1 cooperation across Asia. \n \n2.  The TA is consistent with Asian Development Bank (ADB) Strategy 2030 Operational \nPriority 1: Addressing Remaining Poverty and Reducing Inequalities by supporting NPCI in \nenhancing financial inclusion through seamless digitization of payments; Operational Priority 2: \nGender Equality and Women\u2019s Empowerment; Operational Priority 6: Strengthening Governance \nand  Institutional  Capacity;  and  Operational  Priority  7:  Fostering  Regional  Cooperation  and \nIntegration (RCI) by supporting NPCI/NIPL in promoting financial cooperation across the region.2 \nThe TA is aligned with the country partnership strategy (CPS) for India, 2018\u20132022 by providing \ninclusive  financial  infrastructure  and  services  and  promoting  regional  cooperation  and \nintegration.3 The TA is also supportive of the Digital India Programme,4 a flagship financial \ninclusion program of the government that aims to make digital payments accessible to all \nsegments of the population in a convenient, easy, affordable, quick and secured manner.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The traditionally cash-driven Indian economy has responded well to the fintech opportunity, \nprimarily triggered by a surge in e-commerce and smartphone proliferation. The transaction value \nfor the Indian fintech sector is estimated to be $33 billion in 2016 and is forecasted to reach $73 \nbillion in 2020 growing at a 5-year compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22%.6 The number \nof fintech startups in India has grown from 730 in 2015 to 2,000 in 2019.7 Likewise, India\u2019s digital \npayments subsector has seen maximum fintech activity with 375 startups, with transactions \ngrowing at a CAGR of 34% over the same period.8 Subsequently, there is a consistent increase \nin digital payments transaction turnover in relation to gross domestic product (GDP) (at current \nprices), from 7.14% in fiscal year (FY) 2016, 7.85% in FY2017 and 8.42% in FY2018.  \n \n4.  This steep growth was made possible by the proactive initiatives of the government in \npromoting fintech. The government\u2019s push toward a digitized economy with demonetization, \nintroduction  of  fintech  initiatives  such  as  the  Unified  Payments  Interface  (UPI),9 and  the \nconnection of financial services such as bank accounts to Aadhaar10 have led to a spurt in the \ngrowth of fintech. \n \n1  Fintech is an industry comprising companies that seek to improve and automate the delivery and use of financial \nservices. At its core, fintech is utilized to help users manage their financial operations, processes, and lives by utilizing \nspecialized software and algorithms that are used on computers and, increasingly, smartphones. \n2  ADB. 2019.

To further promote fintech-enabled digital payments services, the government established \nNPCI,11 an umbrella organization created by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Indian \nBanking Association with the core objective of promoting a cashless digital economy, enabling \npayments systems that are secure, efficient, fast and affordable. It is focused on providing \ninfrastructure and bringing innovations in the retail payments and settlement systems by using \ntechnology to achieve greater reach and efficiency in operations. Further, RBI recently released \nthe  Payments  and  Settlements  System  in  India:  Vision  2019\u20132021,12 which  makes  digital \npayments a key focus area and puts emphasis on the role of the payment ecosystem13 and \ninfrastructure in driving safer, convenient and faster payments. \n \n6.  NPCI now further intends to boost fintech and digital payments transactions internationally \nespecially in the Asia and the Pacific region. It is estimated that $1.7 billion is transacted between \nIndia and its neighboring countries through tourism and remittances alone.14 Even on the fintech \napplication development, several discrete innovations have taken place in different countries \nacross the region. These local evolutions have reshaped payment processes and changed the \ndomestic retail payments landscape in the local markets by lowering transaction costs. The onset \nof  COVID-19  pandemic  has  revealed  an  even  greater  role  for  cashless  digital  mode  of \ntransactions. This is likely to prompt a much higher demand for fintech-based digital payment \napplications across the region over the next couple of years.  \n \n7.  While the government has promoted an enabling climate for the fintech industry including \ndeepening international transactions, a dynamic policy and regulatory architecture will need to \nmatch the speed of innovations in this sector. Upgrading the existing institutional expertise is \npivotal to NPCI and NIPL for not only ensuring compliance with evolving domestic regulations15 \nbut also for advancing its international engagements with other nodal fintech agencies operating \nin other countries across Asia and the Pacific. At the cross-border front, a coordinated approach \nby nodal agencies within countries on the technical, legal and regulatory aspects is needed to \nexpand the scale of operations and lower transactions costs for fintech firms at the international \nlevel. Given that NPCI/NIPL would need to advance its existing understanding of the policy and \nregulatory frameworks in the partner countries and keep up with the evolving fintech innovations \nin  the  region,  a  collaborative  approach  through  institutional  strengthening  frameworks  is \nimperative to build a mutually beneficial and efficient regional fintech ecosystem that enhances \ndigital development across the region.  \n \n8.  The local development of fintech industries and digital payments markets, and regional \ncooperation particularly in South and Southeast Asia can benefit from the experiences of other \nregional markets. Countries like the Republic of Korea with high mobile network penetration and \nusage have been successful in registering steep fintech growth within a short period of time. The \nKorean government has launched a series of initiatives including a $252 million startup fund \n \n11 NPCI has been incorporated as a \u201cNot for Profit\u201d company under the provisions of Section 25 of Companies Act 1956 \n(now Section 8 of Companies Act 2013). The ten core promoter banks are State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, \nCanara Bank, Bank of Baroda, Union Bank of India, Bank of India, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Citibank N. A. and \nHSBC. In 2016, the shareholding was broad-based to 56 member banks to include more banks representing all \nsectors. \n12  Reserve Bank of India (RBI). 2019. Payment and Settlement Systems in India: Vision \u2013 2019-2021. \n13 Payments Ecosystem: the network of many different entities that communicate payment information from point to \npoint and relying on each other to operate efficiently and securely.  \n14 NPCI estimates (excluding Singapore) based on data from World Bank Bilateral Matrix. \n15 NPCI, Securities Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India \n(IRDAI), which are independently regulating different fintech applications in respective domains, would need to further \nsynergize plans and better coordinate regulations. \n \n ", "3 \ndedicated  to  fintech,  creation  of  regulatory  fintech  sandbox,16 and  the  launch  of  fintech \naccelerators that can have a tremendous impact if replicated in other countries. The Financial \nServices  Commission  (FSC)  of the  Republic  of  Korea  has  also  taken  up  key  policy  level \ninterventions as stipulated in Measures to Promote Fintech Scale-ups.17 The policy aims to \nprovide fintech firms with overseas business opportunities and to strengthen inter-governmental \ncooperation including the launch of fintech labs across ASEAN countries.   \n \n9.  This TA will address the capacity building needs of NPCI and NIPL by providing advanced \ninstitutional support based on regional collaboration. NPCI and NIPL need to constantly advance \ntechnical, legal and regulatory institutional capacity to effectively respond to the rapidly evolving \ndigital market needs both within the country and across the region. An effective strategy to \naddress capacity advancement needs in an ever-changing fintech landscape is to build robust \npartnerships with other regional nodal agencies, which collectively can address the fintech \nchallenges by learning and leveraging from each other\u2019s experience. Through international \npartnerships, the TA intends to expand the adoption of cross-border digital payments between \nIndia and other countries across Asia and the Pacific region. \n \n10.  The TA aims to support NPCI and NIPL in undertaking operationally relevant analytical \nstudies  on  the  key  issues  and  challenges  surrounding  fintech  development,  and  on  the \nrequirements of identified potential regional partners in promoting interregional cashless digital \ntransactions, using primary and secondary digital payments market research and analysis, and \nexpert  stakeholder  consultations,  among  others.  The  TA  will  further  provide  institutional \nadvancement support to NPCI and NIPL, incorporating learnings from the experiences of the \nindustry in the Republic of Korea, and will help NIPL establish partnerships on digital payments \nsolutions with nodal agencies in other countries across Asia and the Pacific region. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: seamless digitization of payments accelerated \n(footnote 4). The TA will have the following outcome: regional partnerships and collaborations \nthat facilitate adoption of fintech-based digital payments systems established. \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n12.  The TA has two major outputs:  \n \n13.  Output 1: Fintech market development plans for promoting cross-border digital \npayments by National Payments Corporation of India and NPCI International Payments \nLimited developed. This output aims to promote cashless transactions and fintech proliferation \nbetween India and other countries across Asia and the Pacific region. Each fintech market \ndevelopment plan will involve crafting a differentiated country strategy in terms of systems, \nmarketing and public outreach, and infrastructure and enabling regulatory framework that meet \nthe needs of fintech industries in India and the respective partner countries in the region. The \nplans will be based on the analyses of local markets, digital payments landscape, associated risks, \nlegal compliances, and expected cost and revenue. The plans will help provide insights on issues \nsuch as business scope, status of ongoing partnerships, acceptance statistics, development cost, \n \n16 Sandbox: a virtual space in which new or untested software or coding can be run securely. \n17 FSC. 2019. Measures to Promote Fintech Scale-Ups. \n \n ", "4 \nand various marketing cost involved in the process. The fintech market development plans will be \nguided by exploring global best practices to arrive at innovative and customized solutions. The \nTA will also support NPCI/NIPL in establishing partnerships with nodal agencies in selected \ncountries,  which  together  can  effectively  capitalize  on  the  efficiencies  involved  in  a  digital \neconomy.18  \n \n14.  Output 2: Institutional capacity of National Payments Corporation of India and NPCI \nInternational Payments Limited advanced. This TA will further advance NPCI and NIPL \ncapacity and systems in terms of information technology, regulatory and legal compliances, and \nbig-data management that are pivotal in ensuring efficient and effective delivery of flagship \ngovernment initiatives like Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojna (PMJDY),19 FASTag,20 and Direct \nBenefit Transfer Scheme, and to rapidly reach out to urban and rural market segments in retail \nand small business sectors across India. Fulfillment of this output will be assisted by NPCI\u2019s \npartnership with Korean fintech companies backed by the Republic of Korea\u2019s FSC and technical \ncollaboration  with  the  Korea  Financial  Telecommunications  and  Clearing  Institute  (KFTC). \nCapacity building activities such as workshops for key NPCI/NIPL staff, joint hackathons among \nNPCI/NIPL  and  Korean  fintech  companies, regional  policy  dialogues  and  meetings  among \nstakeholders,  and  knowledge-sharing  and  awareness-raising  events  will  be  undertaken  to \nprepare NIPL to cater to an advanced market with a larger volume of digital transactions.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $550,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund (EAKPF) and administered by \nADB. The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. The government will provide counterpart \nsupport in the form of support staff, office accommodation and supplies, and other in-kind \ncontributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  ADB will administer the TA while Department of Financial Services (DFS)21 will be the \nexecuting agency. NPCI and NIPL will be the implementing agencies accountable for the outputs. \nADB will carry out TA administration, supervision, implementation oversight,22 and communication \nwith consultants and stakeholders. The implementation arrangements are summarized in the \ntable. \n \n \n18 NPCI is in advanced stage of discussions with BC Card for its mutual acceptance & issuance. A memorandum of \nunderstanding (MOU) has been signed for adoption of unified payments interface (UPI) & RuPay products in Republic \nof Korea. BC Card customers and NPCI customers will be able to pay using their domestic-use-only cards in India \nand Republic of Korea, respectively. Synergistic effects are expected from the utilization of the infrastructures of the \ntwo companies through the launch of partnership cards, development of new cooperation models, etc. BC Card is \nRepublic of Korea's biggest payment processing company and local brand network headquartered in Seoul, Republic \nof Korea. The company provides end-to-end payment services primarily to financial institutions as well as to \nmerchants through its subsidiary company, Smartro. \n19 PMJDY is the government\u2019s mission to ensure everyone has a bank account or equivalent platform to store money. \n20 FASTag is an electronic toll collection system being operated by the National Highway Authorities of India that uses \nRadio frequency-based identification (RFID) technology for collecting road toll\u2019s through prepaid accounts. \n21 DFS is the nodal department in Ministry of Finance, Government of India that is responsible for the functioning of \nbanks, financial institutions, insurance companies and the national pension system in India. \n22 Integrity Due Diligence (IDD) checks have been conducted and no significant risks have been identified. \n \n ", "5 \nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  October 2021\u2013October 2023 \nExecuting agency  DFS \nImplementing agencies  NPCI and NIPL \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \n  Firm: QBS  Brand, Marketing and  $200,000 \nPublic Outreach \nConsultancy Firm \n  Individual:  Stakeholder  $33,000 \nIndividual selection  Engagement Experts \n(International) \n  Individual:  RFI/RFP Expert  $67,000 \nIndividual selection  (International) \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2020, as amended from time to \ntime). \nADB = Asian Development Bank, DFS = Department of Financial Services, NIPL = NPCI International Payments \nLimited, NPCI = National Payments Corporation of India, QBS = quality-based selection, RFI = request for information, \nRFP = request for proposal, TA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n17.
