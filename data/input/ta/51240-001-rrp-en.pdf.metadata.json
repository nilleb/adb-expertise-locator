THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Republic of Uzbekistan for the Second Tashkent Province Water Supply Development Project. \n2.  The project will support the Government of Uzbekistan in the rehabilitation and expansion \nof a regional water supply system located in the Yangiyul and Chinaz districts of Tashkent \nprovince.1 Responding directly to the water supply shortage of the population in the project area, \nit will improve water supply and sanitation services, pilot the decentralized wastewater disposal \nsystems, and strengthen institutional capacity in the province\u2019s water supply and wastewater utility. \nThe project is listed in the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country operations business plan for \nUzbekistan, 2019\u20132021.2 \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Opportunities and constraints. Uzbekistan is one of Central Asia\u2019s fastest-growing \neconomies.  The  nation\u2019s  primary  economic  driver  is  Tashkent  province,  the  largest  urban \nagglomeration and most economically advanced region. The province is endowed with natural \nresources and vibrant industries and generates almost 25% of the nation\u2019s gross domestic \nproduct.3 Instrumental  to  the  province\u2019s  future  growth  is  the  continued  development  of  its \nsouthwestern economic corridor, which extends along primary road and rail arteries that link \nTashkent city with towns and cities to the southwest. The project\u2019s two contiguous districts of \nYangiyul and Chinaz, located 20\u201360 kilometers (km) to the southwest of Tashkent city, are \nintegral districts within this corridor.4 \n4.  Despite its strong economic growth potential, the province suffers from pervasive urban \nservice limitations, primarily in water supply and sanitation (WSS). Much of its Soviet-era WSS \ninfrastructure has deteriorated, resulting in unreliable services, high leakages and non-revenue \nwater, and elevated pollution risks. Over time, many WSS utilities became almost bankrupt, with \nobsolete and non-functional assets, unsustainable modes of operation, and limited capacity to \nattract investment.  \n5.  Reform initiatives. Historically, sector deficiencies included a fragmented regulatory \nframework, limited sector planning, acute funding constraints, ineffective regulatory compliance, \nand a virtually absent private sector. With ADB assistance, the government has responded by \nreorganizing WSS sector institutions, and implementing sector-wide management, financial, and \ncost recovery reforms. Since 2000, ADB has provided over $500 million of funding for improving \nwater and sanitation services. Commencing in 2015, and driven by the Decree of the Cabinet of \nMinisters 306, the first reform phase focused on regulatory reforms and institutional consolidation, \nincluding  the reorganization  of  provincial WSS utilities, known  as  suvokovas (state  unitary \nenterprises), and the absorption of individual city and district water companies into them.5 \nSuvokovas are implementing extensive time-bound corporate governance enhancements to \nstrengthen utility capacity. A second reform phase, initiated in 2017, is overhauling the wider WSS \n                                                \n1  A very small area of Zangiota comprised five settlements along the administrative border between Zangiota and \nYangiyul is also included. These five settlements receive water supply from the water service network of Yangiyul. \n2  ADB. 2018. Country Operations Business Plan: Uzbekistan, 2019-2021. Manila.  \n3  Tashkent Province\u2019s population (excluding Tashkent city) is estimated to be 2.829 million. City Population (accessed \n18 January 2019). \n4  The population of Yangiyul is about 259,000 and that of Chinaz is about 129,000. \n5  Government  of  Uzbekistan.  2015.  Decree  of  the  Cabinet  of  Ministers  of  the  Republic  of  Uzbekistan                               \n\u201cOn Implementation of Main Directives of Development of Water Supply and Sanitation Organizations.\u201d Decree of \nthe Cabinet of Ministers No. 306. Tashkent. \n \n ", "2 \ninstitutional framework. A new ministry, the Ministry of Housing and Communal Services (MHCS) \nwas established in 2017, and is responsible for WSS sector policy formulation, coordination, and \nimplementation.  MHCS  manages  government  policy  and  coordination  for  WSS  and  other \ncommunal services. The Communal Services Agency (CSA) reports to the MHCS and supervises \nADB-funded and  other externally-funded  projects. Other  national  agencies  have  also  been \ninstituted during this phase.6 A third reform phase is envisaged to create an enabling environment \nfor public\u2013private partnership (PPP) arrangements in the sector.7 \n6.  These reforms are yielding substantial improvements in Tashkent province through the \noperationalization and capacity strengthening of the Tashkent Provincial Suvokova (TPS), which \nis responsible for all provincial WSS services. Since its reorganization in 2016, the TPS has \nimplemented key reforms such as, completed district branch inventories, consolidated smaller \nwater supply systems, strengthened public accountability, modernized management systems, \nexpanded its consumer base, increased tariffs, and recruited personnel. The ADB-funded first \nTashkent  Province Water  Supply  Development  Project (TPWSDP)  is assisting  the TPS to                    \n(i) revitalize the water supply systems of Kibray and Zangiota districts, located to the northeast of \nand contiguous with Yangiyul and Chinaz districts; and (ii) improve the TPS\u2019s financial and \noperational  managements.8 Under  close  supervision  and  monitoring  of  CSA,  its  financial \nperformance continues to improve as the project progresses.9 In recent years, the World Bank, \nthe Islamic Development Bank, Arab Coordination Group, Swiss State Secretariat for Economic \nAffairs, and Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation have also been working in the WSS \nsector in other regions of Uzbekistan. \n7.  Priority needs. There are two priority WSS sector needs in Tashkent province: (i) expand \nthe water supply network of Yangiyul and Chinaz districts; and (ii) provide additional capacity \nsupport to further strengthen the TPS to improve efficient management and to adopt innovative \ntechnologies. Water supply improvements in these two districts are critical because only about \n20% of inhabitants in the proposed project area currently receive municipal water supplies, while \nthe 80% unserved are forced to purchase expensive trucked water, or to obtain unsafe water from \nwells and irrigation canals. Water scarcity causes public health risks and constrains economic \ngrowth.10 Institutional constraints primarily relate to capacity limitations in corporate management, \nfinancial and asset management, and WSS system operations. Currently, only major cities and \nurban centers in Tashkent Province have centralized wastewater systems. The project supports \nthe government in rural sanitation development by introducing a pilot program for decentralized \nwastewater systems. \n8.  Proposed  project.  Complementing  the  first  project  (footnote  8),  the  project  will \nrehabilitate and expand the VU-1 regional water supply system, delivering safe potable water to \n220,000 inhabitants of the project area.11 In addition, the project will extend capacity support to \n                                                \n6  In 2017, the State Committee for Investments (SCI) and the National Agency for Project Management (NAPM) were \ninstituted to monitor and control WSS sector investments.  \n7  Government of Uzbekistan. 2018.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the Republic \nof Uzbekistan for the Tashkent Province Water Supply Development Project. Manila. \n9 Since the reorganization, the TPS\u2019s net sales have increased at a faster rate (averaging 23% per annum) than its \noperating costs (averaging 20.4% per annum). Its financial performance culminated in 2017 with a current ratio of \n2.71, days in receivables of 84, an operating ratio of nearly 1, and a debt\u2013equity ratio of 1.45. \n10 Ministry of Health data indicates that water-related diseases, including dysentery and viral hepatitis, account for more \nthan half of infectious disease incidence, with women and children being most vulnerable. \n11 The existing Soviet era VU-1 regional water supply system covers the four districts of Kibray, Zangiota, Yangiyul and \nChinaz. The first TPWSDP rehabilitates and expands the coverage in Kibray and Zangiota. The proposed second \nproject will rehabilitate and expand the coverage for Yangiyul and Chinaz districts, and five settlements of the \nadjacent Zangiota district. The term \u201cVU-1\u201d is the locally recognized name of the existing system. \n \n ", "3 \nfurther increase TPS efficiency and sustainability. It will do so by incorporating (i) a corporate \ndevelopment and capacity building program, targeting improvements in asset and financial \nmanagement, operation and maintenance (O&M), procurement, public accountability, internal \nauditing, and human resource management; (ii) a sanitation and hygiene improvement program; \nand (iii) strengthening of geographic information system (GIS) and hydraulic modeling capabilities. \nIt will include a sanitation component and pilot PPP initiatives such as private sector contracting \nof the O&M of water distribution networks and facilities, and retail distribution of water supplies, \nincluding customer service, in selected settlements. The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Water \nOperational Plan, 2011\u2013202012 and Urban Operational Plan 2012\u20132020;13 supports WSS sector \ngovernment decrees (footnote 5 and 7); and aligns with previous and ongoing ADB-assisted \nsector projects contributing to key operational priorities under ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030.14 \n9.  Lessons incorporated in the project design from previous ADB sector experience include \n(i) extending the project implementation schedule to accommodate recently adopted government \napproval procedures; (ii) securing timely counterpart support by engaging government agencies \nat an early stage of project preparation; (iii) adding adequate price contingencies in response to \nthe 2017 currency devaluation15 and potential high inflation; and (iv) mitigating suvokova capacity \nconstraints by providing training on financial management, O&M, and customer service support. \n10.  Value added by ADB assistance. The following features provide ADB value addition: \n(i)  Project design and innovation. The ADB intervention initiated smart technology \nfeatures, such as installing (a) supervisory control and data acquisition, and a \ngeographic information system (GIS) for network management; and (b) meters for \nimproved billing and increased water revenue. \n(ii)  Public-private initiative. The project will include a pilot PPP initiative pursuing the \nprivate sector contracting of O&M of water supply facilities in selected settlements. \n(iii)  Climate change resilience. The proposed metering, prioritization of climate-\nresilient materials,16 adoption of advanced technologies,17 and a public awareness \nprogram will significantly improve urban water resilience. The project will enable \nan overall decrease in energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions through \nthe replacement of old pipes and pumps contributing to climate change mitigation. \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The project is aligned with the following impact: living standards, health, and economy in \nTashkent province improved. The project will have the following outcome: access to reliable, \nsustainable, and affordable water supply services in Chinaz and Yangiyul districts of Tashkent \nprovince improved and expanded.18 \nC.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n20.  The project design addresses water shortages and quality issues, O&M deficiencies, and \nsanitation issues. The project feasibility study evaluated three water supply development options \nbased on available water resources; investment efficiency; future operational expenditures; and \npotential environmental, social, and resettlement impacts.20 The average consolidated water \ndemand at the 2045 horizon is estimated at 48,000 cubic meters (m3) per day, with a maximum \ndaily  demand  of  60,000  m3  per  day.  The  application  of  advanced  technologies  and  the \nprioritization of climate-resilient materials are key design features. Proposed technologies are \ncompatible with local conditions. \nB.  Economic and Financial \n21.  Economic analysis. An economic analysis was conducted following ADB guidelines21 \nand derived benefits from (i) incremental water consumption calculated using willingness-to-pay \nand water demand projections as proxies, and (ii) resource cost savings from non-incremental \nwater sales as households switch to piped water from alternative water sources. It also estimated \nthe health benefits from the improved reliability and quality of non-incremental water consumption \nleading to potentially lower incidence of waterborne diseases in the project areas. The resulting \nbase-case economic internal rate of return is 14.84%, exceeding ADB\u2019s prescribed minimum \ndiscount  rate  of  9%  and  confirming  the  project\u2019s  economic  viability.  A  sensitivity  analysis \nundertaken  indicated  that  the  project  will  remain  economically  robust  under  the  following \nscenarios: (i) 10% increase in investment cost, (ii) 10% increase in O&M costs, (iii) 10% decline \nin benefits, (iv) combination of the first three scenarios, and (v) 1-year delay in project benefits. \nThe sensitivity analysis shows that the economic internal rate of return is most sensitive to a \ncombination of an increase in capital cost and a decrease in benefits, and least sensitive to an \nincrease in O&M costs. \n22.  Financial analysis. A financial cost\u2013benefit analysis was conducted, and the results \nconfirmed the financial viability of the project. The financial internal rate of return calculated was \n1.32%, which exceeded the estimated weighted average cost of capital of 0.18%. The sensitivity \nanalysis showed that financial viability will be at risk if a 10% increase in capital investments and \nO&M costs are combined simultaneously with a 10% decline in tariff revenues. To generate a \npositive financial internal rate of return, the analysis assumed under a worst-case scenario that \ntariffs would need to be increased by about 150% in real terms by 2026, increasing thereafter at \n10% per year, except every 5 years when the rate increases by 20%. Nominally, this entails \nincreasing the tariff for residential users from the current rate of SUM475 per m3 to SUM1,188 per \nm3 by 2026. The assumed increase in tariffs requires an annual real rate of increase of about \n14%, which is higher than the 7% historical average of the real rate of tariff increases in Tashkent \nprovince since 2016. ADB has discussed the proposed rate of increase with the Ministry of \nFinance and TPS and both have agreed that the rate is reasonable, given the exceptionally high \ndemand for clean and reliable water supply in the project districts and the relatively lower tariff \nincreases in Tashkent region. The tariff would also be affordable to the targeted household \n                                                \n20 Centralized water supply development options evaluated include (i) the VU-1 well field as a single raw water source; \n(ii) the VU-1 and Chinaz well fields as raw water sources; and (iii) the VU-1, Chinaz, and Almazor well fields as raw \nwater sources. Option (i) has been selected as the least-cost and most beneficial option for the project population. \n21 ADB. 2017. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n ", "7 \nbeneficiaries who have expressed their willingness to pay at least SUM2,500 per m3 for cleaner \nand more reliable water supplies. At present, most of them access clean water through trucks or \nvendors at a higher cost of SUM6,000 per m3. \n23.  To ensure financial sustainability, the government will support TPS\u2019s debt servicing, \nincluding the foreign exchange risk and necessary tariff reforms. The Ministry of Finance is \nmandated to review and regulate the tariff increases. Hence, operating loan covenants have been \nformulated and agreed to ensure that TPS\u2019s financial performance is enhanced, enabling TPS to \nuse the ADB loan proceeds effectively and to meet its debt servicing requirements.  The financial \nanalysis indicates that that the projected operating ratios, liquidity indicators and debt servicing \ncoverage ratios of TPS will meet the agreed loan covenants. \nC.  Governance \n24.  The TPS was established and registered as a limited liability company in 2015 and \nbecame a state-owned enterprise in 2016. It is responsible for WSS services in Tashkent province. \nThe overall financial management risk rating of TPS remains substantial, but this is expected to \nbe reduced to moderate after sufficient training and experience has been acquired by its staff \nunder the ongoing first project (footnote 8). The substantial financial management risk rating is \nbecause (i) the TPS is in the early stages of implementing its first project, and has relatively limited \nexperience as an implementing agency with financial management responsibilities for project \nfunds; and (ii) adjustments are necessary to its accounting, budgeting, auditing, and reporting \nsystems  regarding  the  project\u2019s  financial  management.  The  TPS  is  inexperienced  in  the \nmanagement of ADB disbursements and does not have adequate administrative or accounting \nknowledge to manage an advance fund or the statement of expenditure procedures in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \n25.  TPS\u2019s financial statements and reports require modifications to meet the reporting and \nauditing requirements of the project. Given the substantial risk, the principal mitigation measure \nproposed is that the CSA, with its prior experience in implementing large capital expenditure \nprojects, will continue to supervise and guide the TPS. Financial management consultants will \nalso be available to support the TPS. \n26.  Overall procurement-related risks on the project are rated high mainly because of multiple \nlayers of oversight and approval procedures required by government agencies concerned, and \ninsufficient procurement capacity of the TPS in multilateral bank-funded projects. CSA will \ncontinue to handle the procurement and train the TPS staff. The TPS\u2019s project document \npreparation and review process is considered adequate to ensure compliance with the ADB \nProcurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time). The project will provide additional \ntraining on ADB procurement procedures to enhance PCU\u2019s procurement capacity. \n27.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government, CSA, and TPS. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 19). \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n28.  The project will have a direct impact on the health, economic prospects, and living \nconditions of the population of the project area. By 2025, the project will benefit 220,000 residents \nin 79 settlements within the project area, where currently 19% of all households are poor and 14% \nof the households are headed by women. Health benefits will be derived through (i) increased \naccess  to  improved  drinking  water,  (ii)  greater  water  availability  for  personal  hygiene,  (iii) \nimproved sanitation and reduced open defecation, and (iv) better septage management. \n ", "8 \n29.  Women are primarily responsible for domestic chores, and the lack of reliable potable \nwater  supply  increases  this  burden.  In  Chinaz  and  Yangiyul  districts,  women  are  solely \nresponsible for fetching of drinking water in 54% of surveyed households, while Zangiota district, \nwomen are responsible in 26% of surveyed households. On average, water collecting accounts \nfor  2.75  person-days  per  month  in  Chinaz  and  Yangiyul  districts.  About  70%  of  women \nare responsible for taking care of disabled, children, and sick family members, and 92% are \nresponsible for removing solid and liquid domestic waste. Women working in kindergartens, \nschools, and hospitals bear the responsibility to fetch water several times a day and to clean \ntoilets, since most of them do not have functioning sewerage systems. Provision of safe potable \nwater will have a positive impact on women, and potentially allow them to spend more time in \nmaking earnings for their living. It will also positively impact the health of all family members, \nespecially children and the elderly, resulting in savings on medical expenditures. \n30.  The project is classified as effective gender mainstreaming. The gender action plan \nincludes (i) recruitment of a social and gender specialist in the PCU; (ii) sanitation facilities made \navailable in 10 schools, 3 kindergartens, and 1 polyclinic in the project area; (iii) facilitation of \nwomen\u2019s  participation  in  all  project-associated  activities;  (iv)  employment  opportunities  for \nwomen; (v) training of trainers on participatory hygiene and sanitation conducted (28 trainers, \n30% of them being women); (vi) at least 30% of the project households engaged in the sanitation \nand hygiene awareness campaign primarily targeting women and girls; and (vii) at least 5,500 \nresidents (50% of them being women and school girls) participated in sanitation and hygiene \npublic awareness campaign.   \nE.  Safeguards \n31.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.22 \n32.  Environment (category B). Project impacts are expected to be limited in magnitude and \nof short duration, mostly related to the construction and rehabilitation of the groundwater well field, \ndistribution centers, transmission trunks, and distribution networks. These impacts include the \ngeneration of dust, noise, hazardous solid wastes, labor and public safety, temporary access \nblockages,  traffic  disturbances,  and  construction  material  production  and  transportation. \nMitigation measures to address construction and operational impacts are in the environmental \nmanagement plan (EMP) that forms part of the initial environmental examination. The initial \nenvironmental examination was disclosed on the ADB website on 30 August 2018. Six public \nconsultation meetings were conducted in the project districts. \n33.  Operation phase environmental impacts include higher water withdrawal of groundwater \nsources and increases in sewage compared with the existing situation. These impacts will be \nmitigated  through  proper  implementation  of  mitigation  measures  developed  in  the  EMP. \nInstallation of about 4,000 individual wastewater disposal systems is planned in nine settlements \nof Chinaz district. For the remaining of the project area, sewerage improvements will potentially \nbe included in the next project phase. The PCU within the CSA will be responsible for EMP \nimplementation  to  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  safeguards  requirements  and  national  environmental \nregulations. PCU will assign one environmental and social safeguards specialist who will be \nassisted  by  the  international  environment  specialist  of  the  PMC  in  overseeing  EMP \nimplementation. The TPS will also designate its staff responsible for EMP implementation, in close \ncoordination with the CSA. EMP implementation will be financed by the project.23 A grievance \nredress mechanism (GRM) to mitigate both environmental and social safeguard issues will be \n                                                \n22 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n23 The costs of mitigation measures and environmental monitoring will be included in the construction contracts, and \nthe cost for environmental supervision will be included in the PMC consulting services contract. \n ", "9 \nestablished after project effectivity. In addition to weekly, monthly and quarterly reporting, the \nPMC will assist the PCU to prepare semiannual environmental monitoring reports (EMRs) and a \nfinal EMR (including post-construction environmental audits) for submission to ADB and relevant \ngovernment authorities. These reports will be disclosed to the public on the CSA website (in \nUzbek or Russian) and the ADB website (in English). \n34.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). The project involuntary resettlement impact is \nconsidered as insignificant in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy and Guidelines.24 There will be no \nphysical displacement of people. The project will require permanent land acquisition of 4 hectares \nof arable lands for construction of new water distribution centers and will temporarily impact 22.6 \nhectares of arable land during the construction of water transmission mains. The project initial \nsocio-economic survey identified 68 affected households, of which 9 with permanent impacts and \n59 with temporary impacts. \n35.  A land acquisition and resettlement plan (LARP) has been prepared to address all the \nassociated losses in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and relevant national \nlegislation. The LARP was disclosed on the ADB website on 28 August 2018. Project information \ndisclosure and meaningful consultations with project stakeholders and displaced persons were \nundertaken during LARP preparation, and will continue throughout implementation. When the \nproject design is finalized, the LARP will be updated in accordance with applicable laws, and ADB \napproval will be obtained prior to any further implementation. All displaced persons will receive \ncompensation in accordance with the LARP provisions. The land required for the project will be \nmade free of encumbrances in sections prior to commencement of construction. A GRM is in \nplace in accordance with the LARP, to assist affected persons in resolving grievances and \ncomplaints. The CSA will submit semiannual safeguards monitoring reports to ADB for review \nand disclosure. The cost to implement the LARP is estimated at $461,259, which includes a 15% \ncontingency. The country has enabling laws for fair compensation and, over the years, the CSA \nhas acquired experience in implementing ADB projects involving involuntary resettlement. \n36.  Indigenous peoples (category C). There are no indigenous peoples, as defined in ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement, in the project area. \nF.
