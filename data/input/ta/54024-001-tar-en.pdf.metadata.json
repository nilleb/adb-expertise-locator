INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support the deployment of low-\ncarbon energy supply infrastructure in rural areas and small- and medium-sized towns (SMTs) in \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) by identifying optimal low-carbon models for those areas \nand associated policy recommendations. \n \n2.  The TA is included in the list of projects agreed upon by the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) and the Government of the PRC on 22 January 2020.1 It is consistent with the strategic \npriorities of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC, 2016\u20132020.2 It is also aligned with \nthe government\u2019s priority of supporting low-carbon growth in its Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, 2016\u2013\n2020.3 Increasing low-carbon energy sources in rural areas and SMTs will contribute to the PRC\u2019s \nefforts to peak its carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. The \nTA will support a key strategic pillar of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030\u2014tackling climate change\u2014by \naccelerating the development of low greenhouse gas (GHG) emission technologies.4 The project \nwill contribute to Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 13 by taking urgent action to combat \nclimate change and its impacts; SDG 7 by ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, \nand modern energy for all; and SDG 9 by upgrading infrastructure with increased efficiency and \nadoption of clean technologies. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  In 2015, ADB and the government agreed to establish a multiyear lending program (2015\u2013\n2020) to reduce air pollution in the greater Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei (BTH) region.5  The program \nsucceeded in improving energy efficiency and increasing the share of clean energy, leading to \nimproved air quality and reduced GHG emissions in large urban cities. \n \n4.  The BTH program, and other efforts, are achieving results in large urban cities  by \ndeploying clean and efficient energy technologies that emit fewer GHG emissions. However, the \ndeployment progress is slow in the rest of the country, including in rural areas and small- and \nmedium-sized towns (SMTs).6 These areas have limited financial resources, capacities, and \nknowledge regarding clean and energy efficient technologies compared with the large urban cities.  \n \n5.  The current national clean energy deployment guidelines target large urban cities and do \nnot consider the unique conditions of rural areas and SMTs, which generally bear the higher cost \nfor their low-carbon energy supply than large urban cities.7 To overcome these challenges, the \ngovernment needs to formulate policies and measures to ensure affordable renewable energy \n \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 7 September 2020. \n2  ADB. 2016.

Manila. The greater BTH region refers to Beijing and Tianjin municipalities; the Hebei, Henan, Liaoning, \nShandong, and Shanxi provinces; and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. \n6  The TA project defines SMTs by residential population; a small town has a residential population of less than 0.5 \nmillion, and a medium-sized town has a population between 0.5 million and 1.0 million. \n7  Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China. 2017.

Several ADB TA projects have supported low-carbon development in rural areas in the \nPRC.8 Those projects aimed to address specific local rural clean energy supply issues, focusing \non technology aspects. The activities included maximizing the use of rich clean energy resources \nin rural areas by using government-financed advanced technology such as renewable energy \noutput forecasting. Those technology-focused studies identified that non-technology aspects like \npolicies also need to be analyzed because they can be fundamental barriers in their low-carbon \ndevelopment plans of rural areas and SMTs. This TA will focus more on policy reforms to enable \nthe adoption of non-fossil solutions and deliver sustainable economic solutions without relying on \ngovernment subsidies.  \n \n7.  The proposed solutions would  encourage the private sector to finance renewable energy \nprojects and enable sustainable low-carbon energy development in rural areas and SMTs. To \naddress the financing challenges of clean energy development in poor rural economies, policy \nsupport to improve the business environment (e.g., aggregated demand response services and \ninnovative financing practices using financial technology [fintech]) will be explored by the TA \nconsultant when designing the models. After its success in large urban cities like the greater BTH \nregion, the central government aims to strengthen clean energy development in rural areas and \nSMTs.9 Because local condition varies among the rural villages and SMTs, no single low-carbon \ndevelopment model could address the above challenges. Based on careful analysis of policies to \nadopt new technologies as well as financing practices for the specific local condition, low-carbon \ndevelopment models need to be developed. \n \n8.  The BTH program succeeded in reducing dependence on coal, but the region is still reliant \non natural gas. Although natural gas is cleaner than coal, it still emits GHG and is not acceptable \nfor accessing climate financing. Recognizing these limitations of relatively lower carbon fossil \nfuels such as natural gas, this TA will focus on developing next generation clean energy, providing \ndirection to increase the share of renewable energy, and expanding the geographical impact to \nthe entire country. The TA will contribute to the government's green development targets, such \nas carbon emission peaking by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The TA is aligned with the following impacts: (i) renewable energy interventions in rural \nareas increased,10 and (ii) the low-carbon modernized energy supply in SMTs increased.11 The \nTA will have the following outcome: policy landscape for investing in low-carbon energy supply \ninfrastructure in rural areas and SMTs improved.12 The outcome has the following indicator since \n \n8  ADB. 2007.

Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n  \n10.  Output  1:  Research  on  optimal  models  with  policies  and  guidelines  for  rural \nvitalization via low-carbon energy infrastructure in rural areas completed. The output will \nfocus on local policies and guidelines for affordable low-carbon energy supply in rural areas, \nlowering the barrier for private sector to enter the market. The following will be evaluated: \n(i) optimal technical models of rural vitalization via renewable energy deployment; (ii) optimal \neconomic models of rural vitalization via renewable energy deployment, including an innovative \nfinancing scheme suitable for rural areas; and (iii) a policy and/or guidelines on low-carbon energy \nsupply infrastructure in rural areas for government decision makers. The research will use sample \nvillages as case studies to analyze the models. The analysis results will be disseminated at \nworkshops and summarized in a knowledge product. The policy recommendations obtained in \nthe output are expected to be incorporated in national and/or local government clean energy \npolicies. \n \n11.  Output 2: Research on optimal models and needed policies for low-carbon energy \nsupply infrastructure in small- and medium-sized towns completed. The output focuses on \nmodernizing energy supply infrastructure, improving energy efficiency, reducing GHG emissions, \nand lowering low-carbon energy supply costs in SMTs. Solutions will consider local conditions, \nincluding the rapidly growing economy and energy demands of SMTs. The TA will also explore \nemerging technologies such as digital technology and micro-grids. This output will define (i) an \nenergy modernization scheme for SMTs in northern and southern PRC, and (ii) the relevant \npolicies needed to support energy modernization in SMTs. The research will use sample towns \nas  case  studies  to  analyze  the  models.  Findings  will  be  disseminated  at  workshops  and \nsummarized in a knowledge product. The policy recommendations obtained in the output are \nexpected  to  be  incorporated  into  the  clean  energy  policies  of  the  national  and/  or  local \ngovernments. \n \n12.  Knowledge dissemination. A policy brief based on the technical study will be developed \nunder the TA, and printed publications will be circulated in workshops and conferences. The \npublications will also be uploaded digitally on ADB\u2019s website to maximize readership. The number \nof hard copies will be agreed upon with the executing agency during TA implementation. The \nmajor target audience includes relevant government entities.  \n \n13.  This TA will focus on the policy aspects because the government identified them as \nfundamental gaps in their low-carbon development plans in rural areas and SMTs. The TA will \ncontribute towards the government\u2019s efforts to achieve carbon peaking in 2030 and carbon \nneutrality by 2060. The TA is expected to deliver policy recommendations to promote clean \nenergy development in rural areas and SMTs, achieving non-fossil and sustainable economic \nsolutions without government subsidies. ADB will also share the knowledge it has obtained from \nresources like the Asian Clean Energy Forum. Although the TA design does not directly involve \na gender component, the TA will explore solutions that benefit women, such as improving the \nhealth conditions of those that work in household kitchens by installing low-carbon energy fueled \nheaters and cooking stoves to improve  air quality.  \n \n ", "4 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,100,000, of which (i) $238,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (other sources); and (ii) $750,000 will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Climate Change Fund.13 The key expenditure items are listed in \nAppendix 2.  \n \n15.  The Climate Change Fund (CCF) will finance consulting services and equipment for \neligible activities indicated in the fund\u2019s implementation guidelines.14 \n \n16.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office \naccommodation, information, and documents relevant to conduct the TA, and other in-kind \ncontributions. \n \nD.

Consulting services. ADB will engage consultants following the ADB Procurement Policy \n(2017, as amended from time to time) and  its associated procurement staff instructions.15 \nBecause the TA requires consultants to be familiar with the PRC's local conditions, e.g., local \npolicies and regulations, the majority of experts will be national. ADB will recruit two national \nconsulting firms to deliver the two outputs using quality- and cost-based selection with a 90:10 \nquality\u2013cost ratio and a full technical proposal. The estimated input will be 48 person-months of \nnational consultants over 18 months. ADB will recruit four international individual consultants, \nincluding team leaders via individual consultant selection. International experts will be recruited \nthrough an individual selection method to supplement knowledge that local experts may lack, \nincluding knowledge of cutting-edge business models for integrated low-carbon energy suppliers \nin rural and underdeveloped SMTs and top-notch climate change impact analysis schemes. The \ntotal estimated input is 17 person-months. Time-based contracts will be considered for the firms \nand individual consultants. The consulting firms will organize and conduct workshops. Resource \npersons may also be recruited as expert presenters at workshops. Lump sum and/or output-based \ncontracts will be considered to engage resource persons. \n \n20.
