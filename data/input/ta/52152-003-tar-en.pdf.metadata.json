THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SUBPROJECT \n \n \nA.  Justification \n \n1.  The proposed transaction technical assistance (TA), a subproject under the transaction \nTA cluster (C-TA 0040-INO) Sustainable Infrastructure Assistance Program Phase II (SIAP2) is \ndesigned as a TA facility to prepare and support a range of sovereign project, sector, and results-\nbased loans aimed to enhance access to sustainable and universal electricity services across \nIndonesia. The proposed TA continues, and builds on, the support provided through TA 9113-\nINO and TA 9559-INO under SIAP Phase 1 (C-TA 0013-INO).1 \n \n2.  SIAP2 was approved on 29 November 2018 and is due to close on 30 June 2024. SIAP2 \nprovides (i) project preparation support to specific ensuing infrastructure projects listed in the \nAsian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) current and future country operations business plans for \nIndonesia; (ii) implementation and capacity-building support to specific ongoing ADB-funded \ninfrastructure  projects;  and  (iii)  knowledge  and  policy  advisory  support  in  the  areas  of \ninfrastructure planning and financing, together with program management support for effective \nSIAP2 implementation.2 As of 11 November 2019, total approvals are $9,500,000 (32% of total \nfunds), and there are no disbursements so far. As of 11 November 2019, SIAP2 has an available \nbalance of $20,500,000.3 \n \n3.  The proposed TA subproject under SIAP2 is included in the Country Operations Business \nPlan (COBP) 2019\u201320214 and is consistent with the Country Partnership Strategy 2016\u20132019 \npriorities of increasing sustainable energy access across the country, promoting clean energy, \nand supporting reforms to accelerate infrastructure investment. 5 The proposed TA subproject  \nsupports ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 OP1 (addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities); \nOP2 (accelerating progress in gender equality); OP3 (tackling climate change, building climate \nand disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability); OP4 (making cities more \nlivable);  OP5  (promoting  rural  development  and  food  security);  and  OP6  (strengthening \ngovernance and institutional capacity). \n \n4.  Country context. Indonesia\u2019s economy is the largest in Southeast Asia and the world\u2019s \nseventh largest in terms of purchasing power parity in 2018.6 Indonesia has made steady \nprogress in reducing the national poverty rate from 19.1% in 2000 to 9.7% in 2018 and lifting 13.1 \nmillion people out of poverty. It experienced consistent growth, averaging 5.0% per year during \n2011\u22122018.  Strong  investment  has  been  driven  largely  by  public  infrastructure  projects  in \ntransportation and energy.7 Improved access to affordable, reliable, and sustainable forms of \nenergy is critical to support the government\u2019s focus on human capital and high-level technology \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2016.

Sector context. The government has prioritized electricity access by adding generation \ncapacity and expanding power grids to raise the national electrification ratio from 89% in 2016 to \na target of near 100% by 2024.8 The power grids across the islands in Eastern Indonesia are \nisolated, of poor quality, underdeveloped, and present the greatest challenge to the achievement \nof this target. The electrification ratios in some eastern provinces are particularly low between 60-\n75% across provinces in Maluku, Nusa Tenggara, Papua, and Sulawesi.Moreover, these areas \n \nare mainly serviced, if at all, by diesel-fired generators which are inefficient, polluting, and \nexpensive. Additionally, electrification can often refer to one or two lightbulbs per household, \nmeaning overall access is still very low. Power disruptions due to supply shortages are common \nand household consumption levels remain suppressed. Transition to using natural gas, combined \nwith variable renewable energy such as solar and wind; expanded distribution systems; reduction \nin overloading; and addressing reliability issues for the local population will expand access to \nmodern and cleaner energy services across Indonesia. In electrified regions, such as Java, the \ngovernment is emphasizing service reliability, quality, and increased use of renewable energy. \nThis requires strengthening of the power grid which suffers from overload, low voltage, frequent \ninterruptions and electricity losses that jeopardize business investment and social services, and \nincrease economic costs and carbon dioxide (CO ) emissions. The need for grid strengthening \n2\nwas further demonstrated by the cascading power failure and massive blackout that occurred in \nAugust 2019.9 \n \n6.  To address these priorities, the government and ADB agreed under the COBP to a series \nof investment projects and programs with the State Electricity Cooperation (Perusahaan Listrik \nNegara, or PLN) and Geo Dipa Energi (GDE). The proposed TA subproject will provide support \nfor the preparation, capacity building, and results verification required under these investments. \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities  \n \n7.  The  TA  subproject  will  provide  technical  support  and  capacity  building  in  rural \nelectrification and clean energy, and project preparation for eight lending projects detailed in \nAppendix 2. All loans are part of a programmatic approach to help achieve universal access to \nsustainable and modern energy services throughout Indonesia as envisioned in the National \nEnergy Plan 2017 and the Electricity Power Supply Business Plan 2019\u20132028 (footnote 8). \n \n8.  Output 1: Power sector projects and programs prepared. Technical expertise will be \nprovided to prioritize, plan, and prepare a series of investment projects for potential ADB financing, \nincluding: Sustainable Energy Access in Eastern Indonesia (SEAEI)\u2014Power Generation Sector \nProject (PGSP); SEAEI\u2014Electricity Grid Development Program Phase 2 (EGDP2); SEAEI\u2014\nPower Transmission Sector Project (PTSP); Sustainable and Reliable Energy Access Program \n(SREAP); Geothermal Power Generation Project (GPGP); and Gas Distribution Infrastructure  \nProject (GDIP). The TA will enhance the efficiency of project preparation, address common issues \namong the projects, and reduce the transaction costs through minimizing the need for stand-alone \n                                                \n8 Government  of  Indonesia.

Detailed activities will include, as required: (i) feasibility studies; (ii) economic \nanalysis; (iii) financial evaluation and financial analysis; (iv) financial management assessments; \n(v)  procurement  assessments,  procurement  plans,  and  preparation  of  bidding  documents; \n(vi) gender analysis, collection of baseline data, and gender action plans; (vii) risk assessment \nand  management  plans;  and  (viii)  safeguards  documentation  on  environment,  involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples. The TA will provide support for the use of results-based \nlending (RBL) programs to expand power distribution systems, enhance clean energy and energy \nefficiency, and strengthen institutional capacity. Special attention will be given to involve women \nin the design and operation and maintenance of communal electricity systems as well as training \nmodules on how to use electricity efficiently and productively. It will also support the scaling up of \nrenewable energy use, including geothermal, solar, microhydro, biogas, and other sources.  \n \n9.  Output 2: Innovation and institutional capacity enhanced. The TA will support the \nimplementation  of  loan  components  on  technological  innovation,  safeguards,  institutional \nstrengthening, and coordination among key stakeholders particularly in relation to the SEAEI\u2014\nElectricity Grid Development Program (EGDP1), EGDP2, PTSP, SREAP, GPGP, and GDIP. \nExperts will also provide technical support across the projects, accelerating the implementation \nof power generation subprojects as well as providing specialized technical inputs for renwable \nenergy intitiaves, and transmission and distribution projects. The technical experts will support \nthe development of smart grid guidelines, and safeguards specialists will support  to improve \nwaste management and stakeholder consultation practices. They will also provide inputs to the \nimplementation of pilot projects and scaling up of high-level technologies, such as solar\u2013gas \nhybrid plants, battery energy storage, and electric vehicle charging. The TA will also support \ncollaboration between PLN, GDE, government ministries, and other key stakeholders for policy \nand regulatory development and energy sector planning. \n \n10.  Output  3:  Verification  of  RBL  programs  strengthened.  The  TA  will  support  the \nindependent verification of achievements and progress of RBL program results indicators and \nprogram actions, and provide technical expertise to strengthen PLN\u2019s internal verification systems \nand processes. The independent verification agent (IVA) will continue verification of achievement \nof results indicators and program actions for the two ongoing RBL programs, the Electricity Grid \nStrengthening\u2014Sumatra Program (EGSS) and EGDP1 from 1 January 2020 until 30 June 2022; \nand commence verification for the proposed EGDP2 and SREAP upon loan effectiveness. The \nIVA will verify results through financial audit, procedural verification, and physical inspection that \nwill test the accuracy and quality of results claimed by PLN. In accordance with good audit \npractice, physical verification will take place against a sampling framework and frequency. The \nIVA will use the verification protocols of the ongoing RBLs as the basis for preparation of a \nprogram results verification report that will be submitted by PLN to ADB and cofinanciers.10 The \nIVA will also adopt monitoring and evaluation practices in line with international standards when \nconducting audits or other work as appropriate.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $3,570,000, of which $3,500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Government of Australia through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and \nadministered  by  ADB.  The  government  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of \ncommunication facilities, venue for workshops/ meetings, and other in-kind contributions. The \n                                                \n10  EGSS is cofinanced with the World Bank, and EGDP1 is expected to be cofinanced with KfW. The IVA conducts \njoint-verification of the results indicators and program actions for the cofinanciers. \n ", "4 \n \ndetailed cost estimates and financing  plan are shown in Appendix 1. The government was \ninformed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.
