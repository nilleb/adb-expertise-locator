INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The  Government  of  the  Philippines  through  the  Department  of  Social  Welfare  and \nDevelopment (DSWD) requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide policy and \nadvisory technical assistance (TA) to (i) support the preparation of a national program for \nscaling up the implementation of community-driven development (CDD), and (ii) for converging \nsocial protection programs to more effectively reduce poverty and improve living conditions. The \nTA is included in ADB\u2019s 2012\u20132014 country operations business plan for the Philippines.1 \nDuring the 10\u201320 April 2012 fact-finding mission, the government and ADB agreed on the TA \nimpact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and \nterms of reference. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The Philippines is a lower middle-income country with a population of 95.8 million. In \n2011 it had a per capita gross domestic product of $2,346 and a human development index of \n0.644, ranking it 112th out of 187 countries.3 Poverty incidence in the country increased from \n24.9% in 2003 to 26.5% in 2009, while 45% of the population is vulnerable to falling into \npoverty.4 The country is lagging on progress in meeting the Millennium Development Goal \ntargets on poverty, education, and maternal health. Spatial inequality is strongly manifested by \nthe  significant  differences  in  income  and  poverty  levels  across  regions  and  provinces. \nDisparities in health and education outcomes and inequitable access to basic services and \ndevelopment opportunities are also evident in different parts of the country. \n \n3.  The persistence of poverty and inequality in the Philippines has been attributed to low \npublic  spending  in  the  social  sector,  a  lack  of  a  coherent  sector  policy  framework,  poor \ncoordination, weak service delivery systems, poor targeting and program leakages, lack of \ntechnical capacities, and inadequate accountability mechanisms. While the Local Government \nCode of 1991 provides the legal basis for improving service delivery at the local level and \nexpanding citizens\u2019 participation in devolved functions, the effectiveness of local government \nunits (LGUs) in discharging their mandates varies across the country. Local service delivery is \nconstrained by several factors, such as (i) unclear and overlapping assignments of service \ndelivery functions across tiers of government, with some national government agencies (NGAs) \ncontinuing to carry out functions that have already been devolved, thus resulting in a multitrack \nsystem  of  service  delivery,  (ii)  a  weak  system  for  encouraging  and  rewarding  good  LGU \nperformance, (iii) high levels of fragmentation among LGUs that reduces the efficiency of basic \nservice delivery and inhibits inter-LGU collaboration,5 and (iv) patronage politics and weak \ngovernance that undermine LGU responsiveness to the needs of the citizens.  \n \n4.  CDD approaches have been used by NGAs and development partners in the Philippines \nto augment LGU efforts to improve service delivery and address poverty at the community level. \nAmong the key social development programs that apply CDD principles of participatory planning \nand community control of investments is the Kapit-Bisig Laban Sa Kahirapan (Linking Arms to \nFight  Poverty)\u2014Comprehensive  and  Integrated  Delivery  of  Social  Services  (KC)  program, \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2011.

The TA was formerly titled the Second \nSocial Protection Support Project. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 28 May 2012.  \n3   United Nations Development Programme. 2011. Human Development Report 2011. New York. \n4   National Statistical Coordination Board. National Accounts of the Philippines. Manila.  \n5  According to the National Statistical Coordination Board, the subnational government consists of approximately 80 \nprovinces, 138 cities, 1,496 municipalities, and 42,026 barangays (villages) as of 30 September 2011.  \n ", "2   \nmanaged by the DSWD.6 Studies of the KC program highlight the benefits of the CDD approach, \nwhich include increased household incomes (as measured by consumption), reduced investment \ncosts, and higher economic rates of return.7 In addition, CDD has been found to be effective in \ntargeting the poorest barangays (villages) in the poorest municipalities, responding to the needs of \nthe people, and lessening the influence of patronage in the allocation of development resources.  \n \n5.  The government has recognized the value of the CDD approach as reflected in the \nPhilippine  Development  Plan,  2011\u20132016  and  the  National  Anti-Poverty  Framework,  which \nidentify CDD as a core pillar of the country\u2019s overall development program and poverty reduction \nstrategy.  The  government  is  scaling  up  CDD  implementation  into  a  national  CDD  program \n(NCDDP) to expand opportunities for poor and underserved communities to choose, design, and \nimplement  projects  that  address  their  most  pressing  needs.  Building  on  the  successful \nexperiences of the KC program and other CDD programs in the country, the NCDDP will increase \nongoing  CDD  operations  from  364  municipalities  in  49  provinces  of  12  regions  to  851 \nmunicipalities in 68 provinces of 15 regions. The NCDDP will form part of the government\u2019s \ncampaign to converge social development programs to maximize use of resources and create \nmore impact to beneficiaries. As such, the NCDDP will be implemented alongside the Building \nBridges for the Filipino Family Program (Pantawid Pamilya)8 or the conditional cash transfer \nprogram  and  other  social  development  initiatives  that  promote  job  creation,  livelihood \nopportunities,  and  asset  reform.  The  Human  Development  and  Poverty  Reduction  Cluster \n(HDPRC) has adopted the NCDDP as its flagship project. An NCDDP preparation team in the \nDSWD and an NCDDP interagency preparation team have been created.  \n \n6.  Emerging  NCDDP  features  include  (i)  increased  community  capacity  for  project \nimplementation and social accountability, (ii) community management of block grant resources, (iii) \ncommunity  monitoring  of  outputs  and  development  outcomes,  (iv)  municipal  LGU  (MLGU) \noversight of the process, and (v) a more prominent and direct role of provincial LGUs (PLGUs). \nEngagement of PLGUs is envisaged in view of their mandate that includes provision of technical \nassistance, oversight of municipal governance, intermunicipal coordination, and provincial poverty \ntargeting. In addition to financing local development projects, PLGUs can strategically promote \nintegrated and area-wide development that addresses interregional concerns and the needs of \ngeographically isolated areas. At the national level, the Department of the Interior and Local \nGovernment (DILG) will be expected to provide technical assistance, and monitoring and oversight \nof LGUs. More importantly, the DILG will implement an incentive system to encourage LGUs to \nmove progressively towards good governance practices. The National Economic and Development \nAuthority  and  the  National  Anti-Poverty  Commission  will  monitor  and  evaluate  the  poverty \nalleviation impacts of the NCDDP. The Department of Finance and the Department of Budget and \nManagement will be tasked to facilitate fiscal transfers and undertake overall financial management. \n \n7.  There are however a number of challenges to be faced in the scaling up of CDD. First, \ninsofar as CDD approaches have improved income and non-income outcomes, benefits have not \n                                                \n6  Other programs with CDD features include (i) the Agrarian Reform Communities Project of the Department of \nAgrarian  Reform,  (ii)  the  Mindanao  Rural  Development Program  of  the  Department  of  Agriculture,  (iii)  the \nMindanao Trust Fund-Reconstruction and Rural Development Program, and (iv) the Autonomous Region for \nMuslim Mindanao Social Fund Project.  \n7  J.

Manila. \n ", "  3 \nspilled over beyond the project context. Second, the role of PLGUs in CDD implementation has not \nbeen optimized. Third, the existing policy framework, institutional arrangements, and practices \ninhibit the institutionalization of CDD. Fourth, there is an absence of more stable and longer-term \nfunding for CDD activities. Fifth, there are multiple CDD models serving the same population \ngroups and this exacerbates inefficiencies in service delivery as well as confusion over competing \nCDD approaches. Sixth, the sizeable geographic coverage and magnitude of the NCDDP will \nstrain current systems and require significant structural and operational changes, including capacity \ndevelopment. Seventh, there will potentially be resistance from NGAs and LGUs that may perceive \nthe NCDDP as an approach that competes with their own service delivery functions and platforms. \nFinally, there is a need to clearly identify options and mechanisms for introducing and managing \nthe required reforms for the successful transition and full-scale implementation of the NCDDP. \n \n8.  The TA will therefore assist the government in the conceptualization and design of the \nNCDDP. The TA is consistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020, which aims to reduce poverty and \npromote inclusive growth. It is aligned with ADB\u2019s 2011\u20132016 country partnership strategy for the \nPhilippines, which includes \u2015more efficient, effective, and equitable delivery of social services\u2016 as \none of its four core support areas. The TA will build on ADB\u2019s support to the government in \naddressing  the  lack  of  supply-side  infrastructure  in  the  poorest  municipalities.9 It  will  also \ncomplement the demand-side interventions of ADB\u2019s support to the government\u2019s social protection \nprogram by empowering the poor and vulnerable to take control of and manage resources that \ndirectly affect their welfare, including capacity development of the DSWD, participating LGUs, and \ncommunities.10 The TA will complement ADB\u2019s support to the government's decentralization and \nlocal governance agenda, which focuses on improving local planning and budgeting systems, \nstrengthening intergovernmental fiscal relations, and strengthening local service delivery.11 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The impact of the TA is that poor, vulnerable, and disadvantaged individuals, families, and \ncommunities empowered and protected from risks. The outcome of the TA is DSWD capacity to \nimplement NCDDP enhanced. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n                                                \n9  ADB. 2011.

Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The outputs of the TA are (i) identified options for improved policy and institutional framework \nfor implementing NCDDP; (ii) identified options for strengthened resource allocation, funds flow, and \naccountability  mechanisms;  (iii)  enhanced  capacities  of  stakeholders  in  the  provinces;  and  (iv) \nsupported pilot-testing of NCDDP design elements related to PLGU engagement.  \n \n11.  Identified options for improved policy and institutional framework for implementing \nNCDDP. Under the TA, analytical work will be conducted and recommendations delivered to \nprovide the enabling mechanisms for PLGUs to (i) have a more pronounced role in defining \nprovince-wide strategic priorities and in leveraging their political and financial resources to align \nthe local activities of their component LGUs; (ii) serve as primary partners of sector NGAs in \nmonitoring the performance of component LGUs according to prescribed service standards, while \nlinking these to DILG measures to improve LGU performance; (iii) engage NGAs and component \nLGUs to implement an integrated and harmonized community development platform; (iv) improve \ninter-and intragovernment links and strengthen convergence of social development programs at \nthe  provincial  level;  (v)  improve  resource  allocation  and  expenditure  management;  and  (vi) \nstrengthen  multisector  partnerships  at  the  provincial  level.  Along  with  the  analytical  work, \ngovernment issuances such as executive orders, departmental orders, administrative orders, \nmemorandum circulars, and LGU resolutions will be drafted as needed. \n \n12.  Identified  options  for  strengthened  resource  allocation,  funds  flow,  and \naccountability mechanisms. Central to the success of the NCDDP are the resource allocation \nmechanisms and fiduciary arrangements for channeling funds to the communities.  Funding \narrangements for the NCDDP will (i) ensure community participation; (ii) promote transparency \nand  accountability;  (iii)  prevent  irregularities  and  misuse;  (iv)  avoid  social  exclusion  and \nleakages  to  the  non-poor;  (v)  ensure  synchronization  and  harmonization  of  planning, \nprogramming, budgeting, and auditing systems; and (vi) ensure long-term resource flows for \nCDD subprojects. In this regard, the TA will identify options and mechanisms for channeling, \naccessing, managing, and disbursing financial resources from PLGUs, MLGUs, and NGAs to \nthe communities. The TA will also support the institutionalization of participatory planning and \nbudgeting processes to rationalize resource allocation decisions. In addition, the TA will assist in \nstreamlining procurement and logistics management processes for CDD subprojects.  \n \n13.  Enhanced  capacities  of  stakeholders  in  the  provinces.  Under  the  TA,  expert \nassistance  and  institutional  support  will  be  provided  to  (i)  establishing  mechanisms  for \nmanaging the training needs of officials and staff of selected PLGUs and MLGUs, CDD field \nstaff, grassroots leaders, and community volunteers; (ii) establishing mechanisms for providing \nfacilitation and technical support to the PLGUs and communities during the transition phase of \nNCDDP implementation, including managing institutional risks; (iii) training CDD trainers and \nfacilitators  in  selected  provinces;  and  (iv)  implementing  a  comprehensive  communications \nstrategy to mobilize support to PLGU engagement in the NCDDP.  \n \n14.  Supported pilot-testing of NCDDP design elements related to PLGU engagement. \nThe TA will support the testing of NCDDP design elements in selected PLGUs to identify areas \nfor improvement. The criteria and guidelines for selecting the PLGUs will be developed during \nTA inception. The TA will also support the development and enhancement of a monitoring and \nevaluation system for the NCDDP to ensure timely and accurate feedback during the pilot and \ntransition phases. Under the TA, the results of the pilot testing will be used to (i) consolidate the \ndesign and content of the NCDPP; (ii) strengthen the policy framework, resource flows, and \nimplementation  arrangements,  particularly  with  regard  to  PLGU  engagement;  (iii)  assign \nNCDDP  functions  unambiguously  to  different  stakeholders;  and  (iv)  improve  operational \n ", "  5 \nguidelines and manuals. The pilot testing will provide opportunities for local actors to participate \nin the design process and, in the process, will generate local ownership and support. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The TA will be financed on a grant basis from the Technical Assistance Special Fund \n(TASF-other sources) in the amount of $800,000. The government will provide counterpart \nsupport in terms of remuneration of counterpart staff, office accommodation, utilities, and other \nin-kind contributions. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  The DSWD will be the executing agency and will implement the TA under the direct \nsupervision and guidance of the DSWD secretary. A steering committee chaired by the DSWD \nsecretary and composed of senior officials from the DSWD and participating national and local \ngovernment agencies will oversee TA implementation, provide quality assurance, and extend \npolicy  and  program  direction  to  ensure  effective  coordination  with  the  HDPRC,  other \ngovernment bodies, development partners, and stakeholders. The implementing agencies will \ninclude the NCDDP preparation team, NCDDP interagency preparation team, and participating \nPLGUs and MLGUs.  \n \n17.  ADB will engage consultants through a combination of individual consultants\u2019 selection \nand consultants\u2019 qualifications selection in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The terms of reference for 15 person-\nmonths  of  international  consulting  services  and  48  person-months  of  national  consulting \nservices are in Appendix 3. To provide the TA with flexibility to mobilize expertise as the \nNCDDP  evolves,  the  terms  of  reference  and  selection  method  for  6  person-months  of \ninternational  consulting  services  and  24  person-months  of  national  consulting  services\u2014\npossibly  in  the  areas  of  public  sector  management,  national  government  accounting,  and \ncommunity development\u2014will be determined during project implementation. All procurement will \nbe done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). All procured assets will be transferred to the executing agency after the completion of the \nTA.  Disbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented from 1 August 2012 to 31 July 2015. TA supervision and \nreview missions will be regularly conducted. The expected outputs, outcome evaluation, lessons \nlearned, and methodologies developed under the TA will be disseminated through government \nwebsites, seminars, conferences, and print media.  \n \nIV.
