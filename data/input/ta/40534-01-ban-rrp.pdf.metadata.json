I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe People's Republic of Bangladesh for the Second Crop Diversification Project.1 \n \n2.  The project will foster commercialization of agriculture through interventions to promote \ndiversification  into  high-value  crops  (HVCs)2 and  value  addition,  gender  mainstreaming,  and \nclimate change adaptation. The project is market oriented and demand driven, and will increase \nfarmers\u2019 incomes and enhance food security in Bangladesh.3 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Bangladesh, one of the world's poorest countries, is at high risk from climate change \nparticularly because of its low-lying position along the Bay of Bengal. Poverty incidence in the west \nof the country is 14 percentage points higher than in the east.4 Land, and its cultivation, is the \ncountry\u2019s most basic resource with more than 75% of the population directly or indirectly engaged \nin agriculture. Rice is the dominant crop contributing most to self-sufficiency in food grains and \nhence  food  security.  However,  the  emphasis  on  rice  production  has  resulted  in  increased \ndependency on imported food, particularly HVCs including fruit, which remain unaffordable to many \npoor  consumers.  Therefore,  increasing  HVC  production  is  of  critical  importance  for  reducing \nimports and enhancing affordable and varied nutritious diets for the poor. Fertile and well-drained \nsoils, a varied climate that favors a range of crops, and low daily wage rates contribute to the \ncomparative advantage for growing HVCs in Bangladesh. \n \n4.  The government\u2019s overall objective in the National Agriculture Policy5 is to make the nation \nself-sufficient in food and ensure a dependable food security system by increasing production of all \ncrops,  including  HVCs.  In  the  National  Strategy  for  Accelerated  Poverty  Reduction  II,  the \ngovernment gives highest priority to the development of the agriculture sector in addressing and \nrapidly reducing poverty, and reaffirms its commitment to make the country self-sufficient in food by \n2013.6 The  strategy  outlines  medium-term  policies  and  strategies  to  foster  agriculture  sector \ngrowth  that  include  (i)  increasing  crop  yield,  (ii)  providing  broad-based  policy  support,  (iii) \ndiversifying  into  HVCs,  (iv)  intensifying  agricultural  research  and  technology  generation,  (v) \ndisseminating technology among farmers, (vi) revamping the agricultural marketing system, (vii) \npromoting agroprocessing activities, (viii) adopting climate change adaptive technologies, and (ix) \nundertaking irrigation schemes and flood protection measures. The Second Crop Diversification \nProject  directly  supports  government  policy  on  food  security  and  agriculture  sector  growth, \nparticularly for the following intervention areas prioritized in the National Food Policy Plan of \nAction: (i) agricultural marketing and trade (reducing marketing costs of agricultural products and \nstrengthening value-chain integration), (ii) agricultural diversification into HVCs and a focus on \ninvolving  women,  (iii)  agricultural  credit  (increasing  formal  credit  to  agriculture,  especially  to \nmarginal, small, and medium farmers), and (iv) market infrastructure development.7 \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  HVCs are defined as agricultural crops that give a higher rate of return per hectare than high-yielding winter (boro) rice. \n3  Project preparatory technical assistance was provided.

The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is supporting inclusive economic growth and poverty \nreduction in Bangladesh through its strategic priorities as identified in the country strategy and \nprogram for 2006\u20132010.8 The project is a follow-on to the successful ADB-assisted Northwest Crop \nDiversification  Project  (NCDP)  completed  in  June  2009.9 The  NCDP  substantially  raised  the \nincomes of small and marginal farmers in the northwest region.10 The proposed project will build on \nthe  successful  NCDP  activities  and  expand  into  new  areas,  especially  the  southwest  of \nBangladesh.  The  project  will  complement  the  NCDP  and  other  ADB  support,  such  as  the \nAgribusiness  Development  Project, 11  particularly  by  promoting  value  addition  to  HVCs, \nstrengthening  value-chain  integration  by  developing  backward  and  forward  linkages  between \nfarmers and consumers, and including service provision by private sector agribusinesses and \ntechnically and financially qualified microfinance institutions (MFIs) and wholesale banks. \n \n6.  The  project  is  consistent  with  the  ADB  country  strategy  and  in  conformity  with \nrecommendations made in the recent country assistance program evaluation in Bangladesh.12 The \nevaluation found that lack of agricultural diversification is one of the country's binding constraints to \ngrowth, and confirmed that agricultural and rural development is one of the government's top \npriorities and key to reducing rural poverty. The project is also consistent with the ADB Operational \nPlan for Sustainable Food Security,13 which suggests enhancing ADB\u2019s multisector food security \nengagement by increasing synergy and value addition in backward and forward linkages along the \nfood and agriculture value chain, with particular attention to small farmers and farm households \nheaded by women and other vulnerable groups. The project will be a pioneer in mainstreaming \nclimate  change  adaptation  into  project  design  and  implementation,  following  the  South  Asia \nDepartment  Climate  Change  Implementation  Plan  for  Bangladesh. 14  Climate-resilient  crop \nvarieties, and cropping patterns and technology will be tested and disseminated to help farmers \nadapt to climate change. \n \n7.  The project will actively pursue liaison, cooperation, and synergies with other development \npartners, including (i) the World Bank-assisted National Agricultural Technology Project, 2008\u2013\n2013; (ii) Danish International Development Agency-assisted Agricultural Sector Program Support \nPhase  II,  2006\u20132011;  (iii)  ADB  and  International  Fund  for  Agricultural  Development-assisted \nParticipatory Small-Scale Water Resources Sector Project, 2009\u20132017; (iv) Islamic Development \nBank-assisted Greater Rangpur District Agricultural and Rural Development Project, 2006\u20132011; \nand (v) Food and Agriculture Organization-supported Livelihood Adaptation to Climate Change \nProject, which is piloting short-, medium-, and long-term climate adaptation changes for farmers. \n \n8.  The  project  design  incorporates  lessons  from  other  projects  in  the  agriculture  sector, \nparticularly the NCDP, including the following: \n(i)  Agriculture projects continue to be important for promoting social inclusiveness, \nparticularly of women and ethnic minorities, in the economic development process \nand for reducing income poverty by creating opportunities for employment and asset \ncreation.  Given  the  shrinking  availability  of  arable  land  (decreasing  by  1%  per \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2005.

Providing a very small agricultural loan is \nexpensive for banks, and obtaining such a loan from banks is inconvenient, difficult, \nand costly for a farmer. Credit through MFIs enables farmers investing in HVCs. \n(iii)  Project  planning  and  implementation  must  involve  grassroots  stakeholders  and \navoid use of top\u2013down approaches. Farmer organizations involving women and \nsmall farmers need to be strengthened to increase their bargaining capability.  \n(iv)  More cooperation between the public and private sectors is necessary to ensure \nprogress in commercializing agriculture. \n(v)  Effective linkages with external markets are needed for women, considering their \nrealities in the community. Disseminating labor-saving and postharvest technology \nis important for women's health and for reducing the postharvest work burden for \nschool-age children. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact will be increased rural income in 27 districts of the southwest and northwest of \nBangladesh. The outcome will be improved efficiency and value addition of HVC production. The \ndirect beneficiaries will be marginal, small and medium farmers with landholdings up to 3 hectares. \nLandless  people  will  benefit  through  generated  employment  opportunities  in  rural  areas.  The \nproject area, comprising (i) 43 upazilas (subdistricts) in 18 districts of Barisal, Dhaka, and Khulna \ndivisions in the southwest; and (ii) 9 upazilas in 9 districts of Rajshahi and Rangpur divisions in the \nnorthwest,15 contains some of the country's poorest people and least economically developed and \nmost climate-vulnerable16 areas. The project focus helps address the growing east\u2013west divide in \nthe incidence of poverty and economic development of the country. \n \nC.  Outputs \n10.  Outputs include (i) increased HVC production and commercialization; (ii) reduced HVC \npostharvest losses, improved product quality and value addition, and enhanced market efficiency; \n(iii) enhanced capacity of public sector institutions and participating partners to support farmers to \nincrease  their  incomes;  and  (iv)  increased  participation  of  women  in  commercial  agricultural \nactivities. The outputs will be delivered through five components. \n \n1.  High-Value Crop Production Support \n11.  Project farmers will be provided with the latest HVC production technology using lessons \nfrom the NCDP and closely consulting with farmers. Extension will be through institutional and \nfield-based  training,  demonstration  plots  and  cross-field  learning,  dissemination  of  brochures, \nmotivational tours, agricultural fairs, and ongoing extension services provided by the Department of \nAgricultural Extension (DAE). Technologies will include integrated pest management techniques; \nreduced and zero tillage practices; green and organic manure application; controlled environment \nagricultural technology; and mechanization for cultivation, harvesting, and postharvest handling. \nHigh-quality planting material will be supplied to farmers from the horticulture development training \n                                                 \n15  The NCDP only covers the northwest of the country. Though the project covers the same districts as the NCDP in the \nnorthwest, the project\u2019s targeted upazilas are different from the NCDP upazilas. \n16  Center  for  Global  Change.  2009.

Dhaka. \n ", "4 \ncenter (HDTC) nurseries.17 Women will be trained, equally with men, and have equal access to all \nproject benefits. \n \n12.  The focus will be on crops with a proven market demand, high profitability per hectare, and \npotential for commercialization in comparison to high-yielding boro rice. A range of high-value \nfruits, vegetable, pulses, and spices will be supported as well as cut flowers, potted plants and \nfoliage production, and value addition to coconuts (such as coir and virgin coconut oil production). \nProfitable farming systems involving intercropping will be promoted. The project will pilot test \nclimate-resilient (drought-, flood-, and saline-tolerant) varieties of crops to facilitate adaptation by \nHVC farmers. These activities will focus on pilot locations in drought-prone areas in the northwest, \nand  areas  vulnerable  to  cyclones,  flood  surges,  and  salinity  in  the  southwest,  following  a \nvulnerability assessment to develop effective adaptation options and strategies. \n \n2.  Value Addition Support \n13.  To take advantage of value addition options and improve marketing efficiency, marginal, \nsmall and medium farmers must aggregate their produce to achieve the necessary economy of \nscale, capacity, or knowledge to operate beyond the basic farm-gate level. The project will provide \nfarmers and farmer community groups18 with training and awareness-raising in value addition \noptions  to  improve  their  production  and  marketing  decisions,  and  increase  their  marketing \nefficiency and profitability. \n \n14.  To reduce postharvest losses and improve produce quality on a cost-sharing basis, the \nproject will support farmer community investment in low-cost, on-farm, small-scale infrastructure \n(OFSSI), which may include (i) on-farm (or near-farm) collection and postharvest handling centers, \nincluding washing, drying, sorting, grading, and packaging facilities; and (ii) small-scale cool, cold, \nand dry storage and market-related transport facilities. Farmer communities, supported by DAE \nand contracted service providers, will be responsible for identifying the investment, preparing and \nsubmitting a proposal to the project management unit (PMU) for evaluation, providing land, and \noperating and maintaining the OFSSI facilities. The Local Government Engineering Department \n(LGED), under a memorandum of understanding, will assist the PMU in evaluating proposals and \ncontractors to be hired through a PMU-led tendering process. LGED field staff will supervise \nconstruction works through to completion. \n \n3.  Credit Support \n15.  Funds required for HVC diversification exceed the savings of most small farmers.19 The \nproject will provide access to credit to about 175,000 HVC farmers through financially sound MFIs \nexperienced  in  agriculture  credit,  following  a  similar  and  successful  partnership  approach \ndemonstrated under the NCDP and the Agribusiness Development Project. Credit phasing will \nfollow and be linked to DAE farmer training and the establishment of demonstration plots. \n \n4.  Institutional Strengthening \n16.  Trainers and staff in DAE and participating MFIs, at upazila and district levels, will be \ninstructed on the provision of training and extension services in HVC production and value addition \n                                                 \n17  The project will rehabilitate and upgrade six HDTCs in the southwest of Bangladesh under component 4. HDTCs in the \nnorthwest were upgraded and rehabilitated under the NCDP. \n18  Existing farmer community groups, including those already operating under component 1 and those under other aid-\nfunded projects with the same beneficiaries as the project, can be supported under this component. \n19  Subborrowers rarely have more than Tk1,500 in savings. HVC investment for 0.2 hectares, the average land size \navailable for HVCs for small and medium farmers, requires Tk12,000 on average. \n ", "5 \nto farmers. Department of Agricultural Marketing staff will also participate in the value addition \ntraining. Training will cover gender awareness and environmental issues, including adaptation of \nfarming systems to climate change. \n \n17.  Following surveys and needs assessments, DAE district and upazila offices and HDTCs, \nprimarily in the southwest, will be rehabilitated and equipped. Vehicles will be provided, mainly in \nthe  upazilas,  to  facilitate  communication  between  project  implementers  and  farmers,  and  to \ntransport planting and other necessary materials for farmer field days and demonstrations. The \nproject will undertake a feasibility study on setting up a quality standards certification system for \nfruits and vegetables farms to facilitate access to domestic retail markets, including supermarkets, \nand to reduce food contamination. \n \n5.  Project Implementation Support \n18.  A PMU and two regional project implementation units (PIUs) will provide implementation \nsupport, comprising staff, office facilities and equipment, transport, consulting services, and liaison \nand development coordination with other ministries and development partners. The PMU will hire \none community facilitator for each upazila to (i) assist DAE staff in identifying communities, and \nmobilizing  and  training  farmers  interested  in  participating  in  the  project;  \n(ii) help with gender awareness activities; (iii) liaise with MFIs; and (iv) help promote value addition \nactivities within communities. A project performance management system will be established. \nBaseline  surveys,  and  regular  monitoring  and  evaluation  will  be  undertaken.  The  PMU  will \nestablish and maintain a project website to disclose information about project activities, including \nprocurement procedures and results. LGED will appoint a project coordinator to liaise with DAE on \nOFSSI activities. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n19.  The project is estimated to cost $45.81 million.

The government has requested a loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR27,131,000 \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 32-year term, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and \n1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and \nproject agreements. The interest on the loan will be capitalized during the grace period. \n \n21.  The  ADB  loan  of  $40  million  equivalent  will  finance  87%  of  the  project  cost.  The \ngovernment is to provide $5.42 million equivalent to finance 12% of the project cost including (i) \n50%  of  district  agriculture  offices  and  HDTC  upgrading  cost;  (ii)  100%  of  the  operation  and \nmaintenance  of  the  upgraded  district  agriculture  offices  and  HDTC  facilities,  and  incremental \nstaffing; (iii) 100% of project staff salaries; and (iv) 100% of taxes and duties. Farmer communities \nwill provide about $0.39 million equivalent to finance 1% of the project cost by contributing to 25% \nof the OFSSI construction cost (in kind and land contribution). The high local cost financing is \njustified given that the project is poverty-targeted and meets the financing demand for marginal, \nsmall, and medium farmers, which has low foreign exchange inputs.

Implementation Arrangements \n22.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the \nproject  administration  manual.  Regular  stakeholder  participation  and  consultation  will  be \nundertaken during implementation. The PMU will organize and conduct regular workshops with \nDAE officials, MFIs, and service providers to review progress, identify problems, and discuss \nremedial  action.  Participatory  and  focus  group  sessions  will  be  held  regularly  with  farmer \ncommunities  and  women's  groups  to  assess  their  needs  and  discuss  project  progress  and \nactivities. \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  1 July 2010\u201330 June 2016 \nEstimated project completion  30 June 2016 \ndate \nProject management \n(i)   Oversight body  Project Steering Committee \nChair: Secretary, Ministry of Agriculture \nMembers: representatives of DAE, Bangladesh Bank, Economic \nRelations Division, Bank and Financial Institutions Division, \nImplementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division, Planning \nCommission, Bangladesh Agriculture Research Institute, LGED, BASIC \nBank, Eastern Bank, and participating MFIs \n \n(ii)  Executing agency  DAE for components 1, 2, 4, and 5.

Bangladesh Bank will be responsible for managing and overseeing the flow of funds for the \ncredit line (component 3), assisted by BASIC Bank, Eastern Bank, and participating MFIs that meet \nthe project's selection criteria. An MFI selection committee comprising the project director, and \nauthorized representatives from Bangladesh Bank, Microcredit Regulatory Authority, BASIC Bank, \nand Eastern Bank will be responsible for the final selection of up to 10 participating MFIs based on \nthe selection criteria and financial due diligence assessments. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n24.  Adoption of HVCs will lead to increased agricultural productivity and more sustainable \nresource  use,  and  contribute  to  more  flexible  and  adaptive  management  of  climate  change \nimpacts. The project will lead to increased HVC production, greater diversification of sources of \nincome, and higher net returns for marginal, small and medium farmers. Direct project beneficiaries \nwill include about 240,000 HVC-growing households, of which 175,000 will receive credit. The \nproject is expected to generate more than 37,500 person-years of annual employment; much of \nthis employment will be among landless rural workers, including women. The financial internal rate \nof return of the project over 15 years is estimated at 46.7% and the economic internal rate of return \nat 38.6%. Sensitivity analyses incorporating a range of feasible risks show economic internal rates \nof return range from 24% to 38%. These risks cover a 20% decline in the project area and 20% \n ", "8 \ndecline in crop yields. The economic internal rates of return indicate the project is robust and \nattractive from an investment point of view. \n \nB.  Governance \n25.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government of Bangladesh, DAE and Bangladesh Bank. The specific policy requirements \nand supplementary measures are described in the project administration manual. \n \n26.  DAE and Bangladesh Bank have implemented numerous aid-assisted projects and have \nthe organizational structure, skills, and financial management system to implement the project. A \nprocurement  assessment  found  that  DAE  had  satisfactory  procurement  capacity.  A  financial \nmanagement assessment and due diligence were completed for the proposed executing agencies \nand  participating  financial  institutions.  Project-specific  measures  to  enhance  governance  and \nprevent corruption include (i) advance selection of the wholesale banks on the basis of agreed \ncriteria; (ii) formation of a committee of stakeholders to select participating MFIs according to \nagreed criteria; (iii) use of standardized procedures of Bangladesh Bank in its supervision of \nwholesale banks and, through them, the MFIs; (iv) the requirement for the PMU and PIUs to follow \ngovernment rules and procedures for all expense and capital items, including cash, and to properly \nmaintain financial records; and (v) establishment of a project website at the PMU to provide \ntransparency  on  project  details  including  procurement.  Further,  within  9  months  of  project \neffectiveness,  the  PMU  will  prepare  a  grievance  redress  mechanism  acceptable  to  ADB.  An \nindependent  auditor  acceptable  to  ADB  will  annually  audit  all  project-related  accounts  and \nstatements of expenditure and revenue, and provide a separate audit opinion on the use of the \nimprest accounts and statement of expenditure procedure. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n27.  The project will contribute to economic growth and food security as well as directly benefit \nthe poor by creating employment opportunities in HVC on-farm and off-farm activities. Poor farmers \nwill benefit from increased incomes due to returns from crop production and increased value \naddition through marketing interventions. The landless poor will benefit as agricultural laborers due \nto the creation of additional employment opportunities in HVCs and ancillary industries. Of the \nanticipated 240,000 HVC farmer beneficiaries, 122,800 (50.8%) are living below the poverty line. In \nthe southwest and northwest areas, 51% of agricultural households are poor compared with 37% \nin divisions outside the project area. The project will raise incomes of farmers by Tk73,000 per \nhectare of HVC. Poor households growing HVCs will benefit from increased labor employment of \nTk3,230 per household and Tk12,170 from increased crop income based on an average 0.167 \nhectares in HVC production per household. In total, this represents an increase in income of \nTk15,400 per household (40% increase). \n \n28.  The project will have a positive impact on gender equality. The number of women involved \nin commercial agricultural activities is expected to increase by 10% by the end of the project in \n2016. Women will improve their knowledge and capacity to undertake HVC production, postharvest \nhandling, and marketing activities through institutional and field-based training and participation in \nwomen\u2019s forum groups. Furthermore, the use of MFIs as credit providers, with their pro-women \nattitude, will ensure greater involvement of women as loan recipients (20% increase by 2016) and \nin cosigning loans with their husbands. Participation in the project activities, as observed in the \nNCDP, will raise the social standing of women in the communities and improve their access to a \nbroader range of services. \n \n ", "9 \nD.  Safeguards \n \n29.  Safeguards  were  categorized  for  the  project.  The  project  falls  under  category  C  for \ninvoluntary resettlement, B for indigenous people, and B for environment. The envisioned project \ninterventions will not entail adverse social or resettlement impacts. The project will work with \nfarmers working on their own or leased land. Limited construction will be on government land, \nexisting rights-of-way, or lands owned by the beneficiaries themselves. The project will exclude any \nsubprojects that entail land acquisition or any involuntary resettlement including relocation. The \nproject  will  use  surveys  to  identify  the  presence  of  indigenous  people  when  starting  project \nimplementation in each project upazila. If identified, the indigenous people will be supported to be \ninvolved in crop diversification and value addition activities, through developing and implementing \nan indigenous people action plan as specified in the indigenous peoples development framework \nfollowing ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). \n \n30.  The project may have minor adverse environmental impacts like soil erosion, and harmful \neffects  from  inappropriate  use  of  chemical  fertilizers  and  pesticides  by  farmers  not  yet  fully \nknowledgeable  concerning  recommended  techniques.  Measures  to  mitigate  such  effects  and \nmonitoring  and  compliance  tasks  are  outlined  in  the  initial  environment  examination  and \nenvironmental assessment and review procedures to ensure the project's compliance with ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy (2002) and all applicable environmental laws and regulations of Bangladesh. \nSpecial consideration will be given to the potential impacts of climate change on the project goals \nto promote HVCs; the project incorporates detailed adaptation options including developing and \ndisseminating new climate change-resilient crop species. Moreover, actions and measures are \nincluded to strengthen the in-house capacity of DAE in dealing with environmental issues with \nspecial reference to climate change impacts. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n31.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4. The integrated benefits \nand impacts of the project are expected to outweigh the potential costs from risks. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nNatural disasters such as  Upazilas with very high natural disaster risk were not selected for the \nfloods and cyclones, and  project.
