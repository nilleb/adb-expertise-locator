I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Secondary \nEducation Sector Investment Program.1 \n \n2.  The proposed investment program will support the government\u2019s reform of secondary \neducation (grades 6\u201312) into a system that builds the foundation for a skilled labor force and \nprepares youths to meet the requirements of a rapidly developing economy. It will support \nadvanced teaching and learning programs that use information and communication technology \n(ICT), as well as prevocational and vocational programs, teacher development, and examination \nreforms.  It  will  promote  gender-equitable  and  pro-poor  stipends  for  students.  It  will  help \nestablish more decentralized and efficient allocation and use of resources, as well as strengthen \nsector performance monitoring. The investment program will build upon the ongoing Secondary \nEducation  Sector  Development  Program2 and  the  Second  Teaching  Quality  Improvement \nProject.3 It will further benefit from the experience of the Third Primary Education Development \nProject (PEDP III), which uses disbursement-linked indicators (DLIs).4 The investment program \nlinks disbursement to the achievement of key results. It will further support the transition to a \nsector-wide approach.5    \n \nII.  THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n1.  Macroeconomic and Sector Context   \n \n3.  The Bangladesh economy has grown rapidly at about 6% annually since 2003, up from \n5% in the 1990s. The poverty headcount index declined sharply from 57% in 1992 to 31% in \n2010. Social indicators have improved significantly, particularly for women. Bangladesh has \nachieved gender parity in primary and secondary education participation since 2000. Women\u2019s \nlabor force participation grew from 26% in 2003 to 36% in 2010. Bangladesh has a declining \ndependency ratio of 54%, indicating an increasing share of working-age population in the next \ndecade.  Economic  and  social  progress  coupled  with  a  demographic  dividend  creates  an \nimportant opportunity to invest in human capital to further accelerate economic growth and \npoverty reduction. Seizing this opportunity would significantly help the country meet its goal of \nbecoming a middle-income country by 2021.  \n \n4.  However, Bangladesh has a challenge as 2 million new entrants join the labor market \nannually. Informal employment accounts for 89% of all employment, most of it underpaid daily \nwage labor. 70% of informal workers have no education or only primary education. They earn \nless than formal workers.6 Workers with at least secondary schooling comprise 13% of the total \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2006.

Technical Assistance \nto the People's Republic of Bangladesh for Preparing the Secondary Education Sector Investment Program. \nManila. \n6  ADB. 2012. The Informal Sector and Informal Employment in Bangladesh. Country Report 2010. Manila.    \n \n ", "2   \nemployment and 41% of formal employment. The low skills base of the Bangladesh labor force \nconstrains  productivity  growth  and  limits  economic  diversification.  On  the  one  hand,  the \neconomy needs to generate employment that is productive and requires skilled labor. On the \nother hand, Bangladesh needs to invest more in education to transform the rising working-age \npopulation into a productive human resource base.  \n     \n5.  School  education  performance.  Bangladesh  has  made  remarkable  progress  in \neducation: (i) completion rates for primary education (grades 1\u20135) increased from 53% in 2005 \nto 70% in 2011; (ii) gross enrollment in secondary education (grades 6\u201310) increased from 46% \nin 2005 to 61% in 2011, such that 11 million students are now enrolled in either general \nsecondary schools or madrasahs (Islamic religious schools); (iii) gender parity in enrollment has \nbeen achieved up to grade 10; and (iv) the pass rate for the secondary school certificate (grade \n10) rose from 53% in 2005 to 82% in 2011 and for the higher secondary certificate (grade 12) \nfrom 59% to 75%. These results are due to sustained government reform to enhance the quality \nof education, provide stipends, and expand school infrastructure. Nongovernment providers \nhave played key roles in rapidly expanding the provision of secondary education, as 98% of \nsecondary schools are run by private providers and receive a government subsidy in the form of \na monthly payment order for teacher salaries.   \n \n6.  Despite commendable achievement, Bangladesh has a formidable task ahead in making \nsecondary education more efficient, equitable, and relevant to the economy\u2019s needs. Only 46% \nof students complete all 5 years of secondary education. Girls drop out more than boys after \ngrade 9. The grade 9 survival rate in 2011 was 61% for boys and 55% for girls. Secondary \neducation graduates have difficulty finding jobs relevant to their qualifications because they lack \nthe cognitive and behavioral skills required by employers. Low efficiency and lack of relevance \nreflect poor teaching quality, the limited use of modern teaching methodologies that tap ICT, \nand weak linkage between education and the labor market. The public examination system \ndoes  not  adequately  measure  learning  outcomes.  Access  to  high-quality  education  is \ninequitable, as no common quality standard applies across all types of schools. Madrasahs in \nparticular  lack  capable  teachers,  adequate  school  infrastructure,  and  teaching  equipment. \nPoverty and sociocultural barriers are other causes of low retention. Girls drop out because of \nearly marriage, and boys drop out to seek informal employment. With multiple types of schools \nand administrative bodies involved, the system is fragmented. Low central and local institutional \nmanagement capacity further constrains improvement and the efficient use of resources.  \n \n2.  Policy and Strategic Frameworks  \n \n7.  Policy  framework.  Bangladesh  recognizes  that  its  rising  to  middle-income  status \ndepends on having a large cadre of skilled workers calibrated to match growth and structural \ntransformation  in  the  economy.  It  further  acknowledges  that  the  workforce  needs  to  have \nexcellent analytical and creative thinking capability. In line with government development goals, \nthe National Education Policy (NEP), 2010 envisions high-quality and equitable education to \nprepare all students for the modernizing economy.7 The NEP states that learners should acquire \ncompetency to compete in the job market. It proposes reforms to secondary education to (i) \nimprove the teaching of science, English, mathematics, and ICT; (ii) mainstream madrasahs; (iii) \nprovide teaching and learning materials that are more relevant; (iv) improve examinations; (v) \nstrengthen teacher quality; and (vi) strengthen the decentralized governance and management \nof schools.  \n \n                                                \n7  Government of Bangladesh, Ministry of Education. 2010. National Education Policy. Dhaka.     \n ", "    3 \n \n8.  Secondary education sector road map. The government acknowledges the need to \ndevelop a long-term strategy to meet demand for higher quality and more relevant secondary \neducation.  The  Ministry  of  Education  (MOE)  has  developed,  with  support  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), a NEP implementation strategy for secondary education that draws \non  extensive  stakeholder  consultation.8 MOE  has  further  developed  a  10-year  secondary \neducation sector road map, 2013\u20132023, that builds upon the NEP implementation strategy. The \nsector  road  map  adopts  phased  implementation  of  reforms  to  modernize  curriculum, \nexaminations, and teacher development, as well as to establish and apply common quality \nstandards for secondary schools and teachers. Extensive investment in ICT-based teaching \nfacilities, science laboratories and equipment, other learning materials, and teacher training will \nsupport these reforms. The sector road map further plans to intensify gender-equitable and pro-\npoor  stipend  programs  using  improved  methodology.  It  suggests  expanding  school \ninfrastructure according to need and recruiting better-qualified teachers with revised selection \nprocedures.  Institutional  reform  to  decentralize  education  management  will  redefine  and \nstrengthen the roles and responsibilities of field offices and school management committees. \nExtensive capacity development in management at the center and in the field will strengthen \nperformance  monitoring  and  the  efficient  use  of  resources.  The  government  projects  an \nadditional 3.5 million secondary school students by 2023, to be accommodated by expanding \nteacher ranks by 145,000 and the number of schools by 10,000. Success in implementing \nreform will help meet parents\u2019 and beneficiaries\u2019 aspirations for post-primary education that \nundergirds a better life and higher income prospects.  \n \n9.  Strategic context. ADB has recognized since the 1990s the importance of investing in \nsecondary education to meet national development goals and has contributed to enhancing \nsector capacity through a number of projects. The Secondary Education Sector Development \nProgram,  which  will  close  in  December  2013,  has  contributed  to  curriculum  and  textbook \nrevision; initiated reforms in student assessment, examinations, and performance-based school \nmanagement;  and  helped  develop  model  madrasahs.  The  Second  Teaching  Quality \nImprovement  Project  focuses  on  secondary  teacher  development.  Lessons  from  past  and \nongoing projects show that reform intended to improve the quality and relevance of education \nrequires extensive efforts to sustain and gain from it. The proposed investment program will \nbuild upon Secondary Education Sector Development Program achievements and complement \nthe Second Teaching Quality Improvement Project. It will support the secondary education \nsector road map. This aligns with the country partnership strategy, which emphasizes stepped \nup support to secondary education reform,9 and ADB\u2019s corporate strategy for education, which \nprioritizes investment in post-primary education.10  \n \n3.  Key Features   \n \n10.  Long-term programmatic approach. The MFF will allow ADB to establish a long-term \npartnership with the government to support the systemic reforms envisioned in the road map.11 \nADB will support physical and other investments in a flexible manner to optimize the pace of the \nreforms.  This  approach  will  be  particularly  important  to  the  decentralization  of  education \nmanagement, which requires complex organizational reform and extensive institutional capacity \nstrengthening. As such, the MFF is more suitable than a stand-alone project. \n \n                                                \n8  ADB.  2010.

Manila.     \n11 A matrix comparing finance modalities is accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2. \n \n ", "4   \n11.  Use  of  disbursement-linked indicators. The investment program will use DLIs as \nincentives to achieve sector results, building upon the successful experience of the PEDP III.12 \nLoan disbursement will be subject to evidence of DLI achievement. The investment program will \nfurther  use  the  government\u2019s  treasury  for  disbursement  and  financial  management.  It  will \ndevelop  a  structured  fiduciary  oversight  arrangement  to  mitigate  risk  and  strengthen \nstakeholders\u2019  oversight  capacity.  This  arrangement  will  help  improve  public  financial \nmanagement  and  strengthen  awareness  of  good  governance  and  sector  resistance  to \ncorruption.  This  will  encourage  ADB  and  other  development  partners  to  move  to  a  more \nadvanced financing modality that fully relies on results for financing.13 A lesson from the PEDP \nIII is that DLIs are powerful tools for shifting attention from inputs  to achieving essential results \nthat  deliver  quality  education.  This  demonstrates  that  in  a  large  system  with  multiple \nstakeholders such as in Bangladesh, strengthening stakeholders\u2019 incentives and accountability \ntoward achieving priority results is more effective than focusing on inputs. It further shows that \naligning with and helping the country system improve will yield more positive and sustainable \ndevelopment effects than introducing a parallel system.  \n            \n12.  Transition to a sector-wide approach. Secondary education is currently managed by \nthe Directorate of Secondary and Higher Education (DSHE) through 22 projects under the \nmedium-term budget framework. Though projects may contribute to meeting sector outcomes \nwithin their limited scope, sector planning and management is fragmented and weakened by \noverreliance on external project implementation units. The investment program will support a \nphased  transition  to  a  sector-wide  approach  with  (i)  all  projects  aligned  with  a  common \nsecondary education program framework by 2017, and the number of parallel projects and their \nimplementation units gradually decreased by 2023; (ii) institutional capacity in the MOE, the \nDSHE, other implementing agencies, and field offices strengthened in regard to functions such \nas planning, monitoring and evaluation (M&E), procurement, finance, and fiduciary oversight; \nand (iii) development partners\u2019 contributions harmonized and aligned with the country system.14    \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n13.  The impact will be the increased employability of secondary education graduates. The \noutcome will be a more efficient and equitable and higher-quality secondary education system.  \n \nC.  Outputs  \n \n14.  The investment program will have three outputs: (i) enhanced quality and relevance of \nsecondary education, (ii) more equitable access and better retention, and (iii) strengthened \nsecondary education management and governance.    \n \n15.  Project 1 will be implemented in FY2014\u2013FY2017 with key activities as follows:  \n \n(i)  Output 1: Enhanced quality and relevance of secondary education. This will \nsupport more market-relevant and advanced secondary education teaching. In \nparticular, science, mathematics, and English teaching will improve and expand \nthrough the provision of teaching equipment, laboratories, tools, and teacher \ntraining. Two activities to introduce advanced teaching modalities will be piloted: \n                                                \n12 Innovative Features of and Lessons from the Third Primary Education Development Project (accessible from the \nlist of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n13 ADB Policy on Results-Based Lending was approved on 6 March 2013. \n14 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "    5 \n \n(a) laboratory-based practical science teaching and (b) school information hubs \nthrough  which  students  and  teachers  will  access  ICT-based  teaching  and \nlearning  resources  and  modules.  Supplementary  reading  materials  will  be \nprovided to school libraries to instill the habit of reading. Reform to national \nexaminations  and  classroom-based  student  assessment  initiated  under  the \nSecondary Education Sector Development Program will continue.   \n(ii)  Output 2: More equitable access and better retention. The stipend program \ninitiated  under  the  Secondary  Education  Sector  Development  Program  will \nimprove  and  expand.  The  targeting  methods,  stipend  rates,  and  monitoring \nmechanisms of existing stipend programs will be reviewed toward developing a \nbetter-targeted,  gender-equitable,  and  harmonized  stipend  program,  to  be \nlaunched in 2016. Selected schools will be physically upgraded in accordance \nwith  an  infrastructure  development  plan  and  new  guidelines  on  school \nconstruction standards.  \n(iii)  Output 3: Strengthened secondary education management and governance. \nThis will support institutional development in DSHE central and field offices and \nschool management committees by providing additional staffing and capacity \ndevelopment  to  support  key  roles  and  functions.  As  a  step  to  decentralize \neducation management, monthly payment order management will be devolved to \nzonal offices in a phased manner. Secondary education quality standards will be \nrefined,  and  the  DSHE  education  management  information  system  will  be \nstrengthened to support improved M&E. DSHE will begin to publish an annual   \nsecondary education performance report from 2017. DSHE reorganization will \nstart, and capacity development in planning, M&E, procurement, and finance will \ncontinue to prepare the transition to a sector-wide approach.  \n \n16.  Project  2  will  be  implemented  in  FY2016\u2013FY2017  and  will  build  on  project  1 \ninterventions in curriculum implementation, examination reform, stipend provision, and school \ninfrastructure  development.  Prevocational  and  vocational  subjects  will  be  introduced.  The \nmanagement capacity of DSHE field offices and school management committees will continue \nto be developed.  \n \n17.  Projects 3 and 4 will scale up the implementation of ICT-based teaching modules, \npractical science teaching, and the teaching of prevocational and vocational subjects. Public \nexamination  will  be  revised.15 National  student  assessments  for  grades  8  and  10  will  be \nconducted. The projects will also integrate teacher development reform interventions into the \ninvestment program, as the Second Teaching Quality Improvement Project will close in 2017. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans    \n \n18.  The investment program is estimated to cost $17.1 billion, including tax and duties \n(Table 1). The government has requested an MFF in an amount up to $500 million from ADB's \nSpecial Funds resources, and cofinancing to help finance part of the investment program. The \nMFF will consist of four tranches subject to the government's submission of periodic financing \nrequests, execution of loan agreements for each tranche, and fulfillment of terms and conditions \nand undertakings set forth in the framework financing agreement. The first tranche of the MFF, \nfor $90 million, will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years; an annual interest \nrate of 2% per annum throughout the loan term; and such other terms and conditions set forth in \nthe draft loan agreement. It includes collaborative parallel cofinancing from the International \n                                                \n15  This would include a reform of high stakes examinations frequency, content, and administration.    \n \n ", "6   \nDevelopment Association for $250 million. The MFF term will not exceed 10 years from the \napproval date. The financing plan is in Table 2.

Other  MOE  agencies  involved  in  secondary  education  will  be  co-implementing \nagencies. An interministerial sector program steering committee led by the MOE secretary will \noversee  implementation,  approve  annual  operation  plans,  review  verification  of  DLI \nachievement, and ensure compliance with fiduciary oversight arrangements. A sector program \nimplementation committee led by the DSHE director general will coordinate implementation by \nall agencies, review implementation progress, and recommend approval of annual operation \nplans.

Disbursement  conditions  and  arrangements.  ADB  will  disburse  its  loan  to  the \ngovernment\u2019s  consolidated  fund  through  a  designated  account  with  the  Bangladesh  Bank. \nExpenditures will be made from the treasury via accounting offices under the controller general \nof accounts system on the basis of the approved annual budget. Disbursement will be made \nannually on a reimbursement basis with amounts subject to (i) evidence of achieving DLIs and \n(ii) submission and acceptance of a statement of expenditure based on the interim unaudited \nfinancial reports for the corresponding period. Flexibility will be allowed for partial disbursement \nand disbursement for late achievement of annual DLIs. DLI achievement will be verified through \na detailed verification protocol that includes third-party validation by independent institutions, \nwhere appropriate. The interim unaudited financial reports, which will be generated by the \ngovernment\u2019s  integrated  budgeting  and  accounting  system,  are  required  to  show  that \ngovernment  spending  on  eligible  expenditures  under  each  program  budget  head  exceeds \nADB\u2019s contribution for the corresponding period.  \n \n21.  Disbursement-linked indicators for FY2014\u2013FY2017. DLIs have been selected from \nthe results framework for projects 1 and 2 through extensive stakeholder consultation.18 The \nDLIs  target  a  range  of  results  that  include  sector  outcomes,  intermediate  outcomes,  and \ninstitutional development: (i) an increase in the enrollment ratio in science subjects, (ii) an \nincrease in the number of students accessing ICT-based teaching and learning resources, \n(iii) improved school attendance among stipend recipients, (iv) the decentralization of monthly \npayment order management to zonal offices, (v) the publication of the initial annual report on \nsecondary  education  sector  performance,  (vi)  a  common  secondary  education  program \nframework developed by the MOE, (vii) increased budget allocations to secondary education \nand  satisfactory  budget  execution,  (viii)  improved  procurement  and  financial  management \npractices, and (ix) improved gross enrollment rates (grades 6\u201310) and grade 9 survival rates.  \n                                                \n18  Disbursement-Linked Indicators (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n \n ", "8   \n \n22.  The  government  will  procure  all  goods,  works,  and  consulting  services  for  the \ninvestment  program.  Goods  and  civil  works  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time). Goods valued at more than $1 \nmillion and works valued at more than $2 million will be procured using international competitive \nbidding and ADB's standard bidding documents, and be subject to prior review. Goods and \nworks  valued  below  the  international  competitive  bidding  threshold  will  be  procured  using \nnational competitive bidding in accordance with the government\u2019s Public Procurement Act, 2006 \nand its Public Procurement Rules, 2008, subject to modifications agreed by the government and \nADB. All consultants will be selected using ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, \nas amended from time to time). Consulting firms will be recruited through quality- and cost-\nbased selection and consultants' qualification selection, subject to ADB prior review.  \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n23.  The economic viability of the investment program has been assessed based on overall \nreturn on education, analyzed using Bangladesh household and income expenditure surveys in \n2005 and 2010 and a cost\u2013benefit analysis for projects 1 and 2. The underlying economic \nbenefit will derive from improved internal efficiency reflecting reduced dropout and repetition \nrates  and  from  higher  wages  for  secondary  education  graduates,  who  will  obtain  better \nemployment, probably in the formal sector. Costs include investment program and private costs \nthat comprise direct household outlays and opportunity costs. The economic internal rate of \nreturn was calculated at 18.8% for 4 years. A sensitivity analysis using low and high scenarios \nfor progress in internal efficiency and external efficiency gains gives economic internal rates of \nreturn  ranging  from  13.9%  to  23.5%,  which  suggests  that  the  investment  program  is \neconomically very sound.  \n \n24.  Fiscal sustainability will depend on three factors: (i) adequate budget delegated to the \nMOE to cover estimated investments and associated recurrent expenditures for secondary \neducation as per the forecast of the medium-term budget framework, (ii) improved secondary \neducation efficiency as envisaged, and (iii) the institutionalization of MOE and DSHE functions \nas envisaged in the sector-wide approach road map. As proposed in the NEP, the government \nis likely to increase its budget allocation for education to enable NEP reform to take place. A DLI \non sector finance will provide additional incentive for the Ministry of Finance to allocate an \nadequate annual budget for secondary education in line with medium-term budget framework \nforecasts. Enhanced institutional capacity in the MOE and the DSHE will ease overreliance on \nexternal project implementation units and build confidence in sector capacity to implement and \ndeliver sector results. This will encourage higher budget allocation to the sector.  \n \nB.  Governance \n \n25.  The procurement capacity assessment showed that the country\u2019s procurement laws \nand  procedures  have  improved  following  extensive  procurement  reform  since  2003.  The \ngovernment recently launched its electronic government procurement system, which will help \nimprove efficiency, transparency, and competition in procurement. At the sector level, however, \nthe  MOE  needs  to  improve  procurement  practices  and  strengthen  oversight  to  ensure \ncompliance with agreed procurement rules and procedures. The MOE and the DSHE rely \nheavily on projects and their implementation units for procurement. Establishing a permanent \nprocurement and finance division in the DSHE is thus warranted in the medium term. To \n ", "    9 \n \nimprove capacity, procurement and documentation need to be monitored and a systematic \nfiduciary oversight arrangement agreed. The electronic government procurement system should \nbe introduced on a priority basis. Using the assessment, measures to improve procurement and \nmitigate risk have been consolidated in a procurement and financial management action plan.  \n \n26.  The financial management assessment shows that reform of the integrated budgeting \nand accounting system through the Strengthening Public Expenditure Management Program, \nsupported  by  development  partners,  has  improved  financial  management.  The  system  is \ngradually gaining the trust of aid programs now willing to rely on it. The PEDP III has contributed \nsignificantly to improving the integrated budgeting and accounting system by introducing new \nschemes to track uncleared advances, payment processing time, and monthly reconciliation of \naccounts. Measures have been identified to further mainstream good practices in financial \nmanagement through adequate budget execution, improved quality of financial reporting, and \ncapacity development for the MOE internal audit. These measures have been consolidated in \nthe  procurement  and  financial  management  action  plan.  Bangladesh  ranked  144  of  176 \ncountries  in  Transparency  International\u2019s  corruption  perception  index  in  2012,  showing \ncorruption still perceived as key concern. ADB\u2019s country level assessment also stresses the \nneed to improve governance. A key development in the country\u2019s anticorruption initiative and \ngovernance reform is the National Integrity Strategy approved in 2012. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption \nPolicy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government. \nSpecific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are  described  in  the  facility \nadministration manual. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n27.  The Household and Income Expenditure Survey, 2010 shows net enrollment of children \nfrom poor households at 37%, well below the 59% for other households.19 Girls have higher \ndropout rates and lower performance in high-stakes examinations. The investment program will \ndirectly  benefit  students  from  poor  and  disadvantaged  families,  madrasahs,  and  girls  by \nimproving their access to high-quality education. A more efficient and better-targeted stipend \nprogram  will  help  lift  poverty  and  sociocultural  barriers  affecting  girls\u2019  and  boys\u2019  school \nattendance. Project 1 is classified under category I (gender equity as a theme).20 Specific \nmeasures addressing girls\u2019 retention and academic performance issues are in the gender action \nplan.21  \n \nD.  Safeguards \n \n28.  An environmental assessment and review framework, a resettlement framework, and an \nindigenous peoples\u2019 planning framework22 prepared for the investment program outline the \nenvironmental and social safeguard principles and requirements. Project 1 is category B for \nenvironment.  The  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  will  ensure  the  full \nmitigation of any environmental impacts from civil works including construction of additional \nclassrooms  and  science  and  ICT  laboratories.  Project  1  is  category  C  for  involuntary \nresettlement, as no acquisition of land or relocation of residents is required. Indigenous people \nwill not suffer any adverse impact but will likely benefit from project 1. To ensure this occurs in a \nculturally appropriate manner, project 1 was classified under category B for indigenous peoples. \n                                                \n19 Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics. 2010.
