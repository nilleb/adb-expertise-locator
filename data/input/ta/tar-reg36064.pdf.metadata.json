In  1997,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  initiated  the  Central  Asia  Regional \nEconomic Cooperation Program (the CAREC Program) among its member countries in Central \nAsia.1 Seven countries have participated in the CAREC Program: Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, \nKyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, People's Republic of China (PRC), Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. Over \nthe past few years, modest progress has been made with ADB\u2019s support in fostering mutual \ntrust and understanding; identifying, preparing, and implementing key regional projects; and \nimproving policy environments in priority sectors of transport, energy, and trade facilitation. At \nthe Ministerial Conference on Central Asia Economic Cooperation held during 25\u201326 March \n2002,  the  participating  countries  reiterated  their  strong  commitment  to  regional  economic \ncooperation  and  requested  ADB  to  continue  its  support  for  addressing  long-term  regional \ndevelopment challenges. In this connection, the governments indicated their support for the \nGreater Silk Road Initiative (formerly phase III, regional economic cooperation in Central Asia). \nThe technical assistance (TA) framework is at Appendix 1.2     \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Since independence in early 1990s, the Central Asian republics (CARs) have been \nconfronted with the twin tasks of nation building and transition to a market-based economy. \nThese  tasks  are  rendered  particularly  formidable  by  a  number  of  regional  development \nconstraints including (i) the region's landlocked geographical location with only remote access to \nmajor  world  markets,  (ii)  limited  size  of  domestic  markets,  and  (iii)  mutually  dependent \nendowments  of  vital  resources  of  water  and  energy  across  the  countries.  Together  these \nconstraints suggest a high degree of economic interdependence in the region, and highlight the \nimportance of market integration through reduced transaction costs, including transport and \ntransit costs, economies of scale and scope, and the rational use of energy and water.      \n \n3.  Central  Asia  has  close  historical  and  ethnic  ties,  and  vital  present  and  potential \neconomic linkages to Afghanistan. Since the mid 1990s, the threat of instability in Afghanistan \nhad been a major reason for border closings, tightening of control over transit and traffic, and \nintermittent and unpredictable disruption of road and rail transport. Developments since the \nevents of 11 September 2001 have set the stage for stability and peace to return to the region. \nThe removal of a major source of instability would enable governments in the region to focus \ntheir limited resources on longer term development issues. These developments have also \nopened up new opportunities for cooperation with other subregions, especially South Asia. \n \n4.  The  common  development  challenges  and  recent  regional  developments  highlight \neconomic cooperation as a key to achieving stability and prosperity and reducing poverty in the \nregion. In this regard, cooperative efforts among the countries and support from development \npartners have continued. Notwithstanding progress made, a number of constraints remain that \nhinder cooperation. In addition to the need for stronger political will, the tendency of seeking \n                                                 \n1  The regional economic cooperation program in Central Asia has been supported by ADB. 1996.

", "2 \nself-sufficiency rather than exploiting mutually beneficial gains persists. Given the weak fiscal \nand budgetary positions of the governments in the region, financing regional projects continues \nto  be  challenging.  Moreover,  limited  institutional  capacity  of  the  countries  for  regional \ncooperation  remains  a  constraining  factor.  In  addition,  barriers,  especially  nontariff  and \nnonphysical barriers to trade, continue to hamper market integration in the region.      \n \n5.  ADB's  CAREC  Program,  which  was  initiated  in  1997,  has  focused  on  addressing \nregional  long-term  development  challenges  (para.2)  by  financing  infrastructure  needs  and \nimproving policy environments in the priority sectors of transport, energy, and trade facilitation. \nThe  CAREC  Program  has  followed  a  results-oriented  approach,  which  advocates  tangible \nbenefits  from  concrete  projects  as  building  blocks  toward  achieving  longer  term  strategic \nobjectives. With strong country support, ADB has developed a partnership with participating \ncountries. The CAREC Program has achieved some degree of success. It has (i) increased the \nnumber  of  core  members  from  four  in  1997  to  seven  in  2002;  (ii)  enhanced  mutual \nunderstanding and consensus on economic cooperation through workshops, publications, and \nconsultations; (iii) identified in the priority sectors regional projects, which are at various stages \nof preparation and implementation; and (iv) complemented ADB's country operation in the \nregion, particularly in transport and energy.    \n \n6.  With  the  CAREC  Program  growing  in  breadth  and  depth,  an  overall  institutional \nframework3  was  established  in  January  2002  in  order  to  ensure  continued  firm  country \nownership, strengthen the overall planning and implementation, and enhance coordination of \nfunding. The first Ministerial Conference under the framework was held during 25\u201326 March \n2002. Significantly, the conference reconfirmed transport, energy, and trade facilitation as the \npriority areas of cooperation and reaffirmed ADB's results-oriented approach and its continued \nmajor role in mobilizing financing for the region's infrastructure needs. \n \n7.  Given the long-term development obstacles of the region and weak capacity of the \ncountries for cooperation, the overall objective and strategic focus of the CAREC Program will \nremain valid (paras. 2-4). However, ADB's regional program faces new challenges, especially in \nthe wake of the events of 11 September.  \n \n8.  First, while the events of 11 September underscored the strategic importance of regional \neconomic cooperation, support needs to be concrete and tangible to keep the momentum of \ncooperation. Therefore, greater efforts are needed to ensure the effective implementation of the \nexisting regional projects, and to develop new ones, as these projects are the key to fostering \ntrust and building mutual understanding. The resources for such regional projects are likely to \ngo far beyond the combined capabilities of the governments and ADB. Accordingly, it is crucial \nto create an environment to attract private investors, including foreign direct investment.  \n \n 9.  Second, the CAREC Program has an urgent need to broaden its geographical scope. \nGiven recent developments relating to Afghanistan and the joining of new members, concrete \nways of cooperation need to be explored and developed to assist the countries in Central Asia \nto seize this historic window of opportunities. CARs could make significant contributions to the \nreconstruction  and  development  of  Afghanistan  by  using  available  human  and  natural \nresources. In turn, Afghanistan could provide a route for exporting natural resources of CARs to \nSouth  Asia.  The  CARs  and  Afghanistan  have  expressed  their  strong  interests  in  close \ncooperation in the reconstruction of Afghanistan. In addition, efforts are needed to prepare \n                                                 \n3  The overall institutional framework has an annual ministerial conference as its decision-making body, sectoral \ncoordinating committees and working groups at the operational level, national focal points and a secretariat. ", "    3 \nTurkmenistan for formally joining the CAREC Program.4 To the east, the PRC's accession to the \nWorld Trade Organization in 2001 and the acceleration of the development of its western \nregions will create more opportunities for mutually beneficial cooperation with the CARs.  \n \n10.  Third, the building of trust, mutual understanding, and consensus has been a key to past \nprogress of the CAREC Program and continues to be critical for its future success. Experience \ndemonstrates that effective institutional support could contribute much to this end, and, in this \nregard,  the  overall  institutional  framework  established  in  2002  between  ADB  and  the \nparticipating  countries  will  play  a  crucial  role.  ADB,  as  CAREC  Program's  secretariat,  is \ncommitted to ensuring the effective functioning of the framework. At the same time, closer \ncoordination with development partners will be sought as other agencies are also increasing \ntheir assistance to address regional challenges. This will bring about complementarity and \nsynergy to the CAREC Program.  \n \n11.  Against this background, the Greater Silk Road Initiative will be launched in support of \nregional  economic  cooperation,  aimed  at  achieving  concrete  progress  toward  stability  and \nprosperity in Central Asia.      \n    \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n12.  The overall goal of the TA is to promote economic growth and raise living standards of \nthe countries in Central Asia through economic cooperation. Toward this end, the TA has three \nspecific purposes: (i) to elevate efforts to identify, prepare, and implement key regional projects \nin priority sectors; (ii) to explore new cooperation opportunities in line with the widening of \ngeographical scope; and (iii) to strengthen the partnership between ADB and the participating \ncountries through the overall institutional framework. \n  \n13.  The  expected  outputs  will  be  (i)  preparation  of  existing  key  regional  projects  and \nidentification of new ones in the priority sectors of transport, energy, and trade facilitation; (ii) \nidentification  of  new  regional  projects  and  programs;  and  (iii)  strengthened  institutional \nframework for fostering mutual trust and understanding.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  As an umbrella TA, the TA will be guided by the Ministerial Conference under the overall \ninstitutional  framework.  Close  consultation  will  be  conducted  with  the  national  focal  points \n(NFPs),  sectoral  coordinating  committees  (SCCs)  and  senior  officials  meeting  under  the \nframework throughout the TA implementation. Specifically, the TA will support the following \nactivities. \n \n15.  First, the TA will support efforts to identify, prepare, and implement key regional projects \nin  the  priority  sectors  of  transport,  energy,  and  trade.  These  include  (i)  assisting  the \nimplementation of the existing multiphased priority projects through working-level meetings, (ii) \nassisting in preparing road maps in each priority sector based on regional sector studies, and \n(iii) identifying and developing new regional projects. In addition, the TA will support preparing a \ncapacity building plan including regional training programs, which will assist the countries in \nbetter managing the CAREC Program and improving effectiveness in implementing regional \n                                                 \n4  Turkmenistan attended the Ministerial Conference held in March 2002 as an observer. ", "4 \nprojects. These activities will be closely coordinated through SCCs in each sector under the \nguidance of the overall institutional framework.   \n \n16.  Second, the TA will support expanding the geographical scope of the CAREC Program \nincluding  Afghanistan.  It  will  assist  in  facilitating  this  cooperation  between  CARs  and \nAfghanistan, and through it, South Asian subregions, especially in transport and energy.5 In this \nprocess, close cooperation with the other departments of ADB will be strengthened. Another \nimportant  effort  will  be  to  launch  a  study  on  identifying  cooperation  opportunities  among \nXinjiang, PRC; Mongolia; and CARs. The study is expected to provide a diagnostic analysis of \ncooperation among the countries concerned, and recommend project concepts to promote \ncooperation, especially in view of the Western Development Strategy unveiled by the PRC \ngovernment in 2000.   \n \n17.  Third, to strengthen the partnership between ADB and participating countries, the TA will \nsupport enhancing the institutional capacity for effective regional economic cooperation, and \nproviding  technical,  administrative,  and  coordinating  assistance  to  the  overall  institutional \nframework. As the Secretariat, ADB will support the regular holding of high-level policy dialogue \nand consensus building, strengthening of the regional programming mechanism, and improving \nof coordination with other development partners in Central Asia. In particular, these include (i) \npreparing regular conferences/meetings, such as the Ministerial Conference on Central Asia \nEconomic Cooperation to be held in Tashkent, Uzbekistan in 2003, senior officials meeting(s), \nand other preparatory and working level meetings under the overall institutional framework; (ii) \nfacilitating coordination with development partners actively working on regional issues in Central \nAsia;  (iii)  strengthening  national  capacity  on  regional  economic  cooperation  within  the \nframework by holding workshop(s) for relevant government officials including NFPs; and (iv) \nproviding other support as the secretariat to the framework. \n    \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The estimated TA cost is $1 million equivalent. ADB will finance $950,000 on a grant \nbasis from ADB's TA funding program. The participating governments will provide the remaining \n$50,000 equivalent, largely in kind. Detailed cost estimates are given in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA. A steering committee, to be chaired by the \ndirector general of ADB\u2019s East and Central Asia Department, will guide and coordinate the TA \nactivities. A project secretariat will be headed by the head of the Central Asian Regional \nEconomic Cooperation Unit (CARECU), and will include consultants and support staff. Activities \nunder the TA will be coordinated closely with ADB resident missions in the region to ensure \neffective implementation. Close coordination and cooperation will also be sought with other \nmultilateral  and  bilateral  agencies  and  regional  institutions  concerned  with  economic \ncooperation.  \n \n20.  Consulting services comprising 15 person-months of international and 72 person-months \nof domestic consultants will be needed for implementing the TA. Three groups of consultants \nwill be engaged: (i) a core group that will serve as resource persons to assist the steering \ncommittee and project secretariat in the implementation of the TA; (ii) sector specialists, who will \n                                                 \n5  While the possibility is already being explored, the security situation in Afghanistan will continue to constrain such \ncooperation.    ", "    5 \nhelp prepare and implement regional projects, studies, and cooperation with Afghanistan; and \n(iii) regional cooperation specialists, who will conduct the special study on cooperation among \nCARs, Mongolia, and Xinjiang, PRC, and serve as local coordinators in ADB resident missions. \nAll consultants will be selected as individuals in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic \nconsultants.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  of  consultants  are  shown  in  Appendix  3.  The \nprocurement of equipments and materials will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \n \n21.  The proposed TA will be implemented over a period of 14 months starting from 1 \nNovember 2002 and will end by 31 December 2003. Conference and meeting proceedings, and \nthe studies and reports will be published and posted on the CAREC website as appropriate.    \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n22.
