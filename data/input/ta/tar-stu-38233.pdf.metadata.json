In 2003, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) began examining workers\u2019 remittances in \nthe context of Philippine operations, with a general overview study,1 followed by the recently \ncompleted technical assistance (TA) 41852 which mainly studied bilateral flows from the United \nStates  (US)  and  Singapore  to  the  Philippines.  For  many  developing  countries,  overseas \nworkers\u2019 remittances are an important source of funds, and a large amount  is transferred \nthrough a variety of official and unofficial mechanisms. Building on this work, the proposed TA \nwill examine remittance fund flow from a regional perspective to encourage (i)  increased \nremittances, and (ii) use of formal sector channels for fund transfer.  The region\u2019s countries \nrequested ADB to undertake such a study. Its design, to be supported by a regional technical \nassistance (RETA), and the concerned jurisdictions\u2019 preparedness to participate in the RETA \nactivities, have been confirmed. Appendix 1 contains the TA framework.3  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Official remittances of migrant workers from South Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific \naccounted for 34% of the global total of $80 billion; estimates are that half as much also flows \nthrough informal channels. The World Bank\u2019s Global Development Finance 20034 states that \nremittances are now the second largest source of external funding for developing countries, \nnext only to foreign direct investments. Although the recent International Monetary Fund (IMF) \nanalytical  study5 questions  it  as  a  useful  and  reliable  tool  to  support  economic  growth, \nremittance is one of the least volatile sources of foreign currency, and already accounts for a \nsignificant portion of many recipient countries\u2019 gross domestic product (GDP). For instance, \nmigrant workers\u2019 remittances through official channels to the Philippines and Sri Lanka are 8.9% \nand 7.0% of their respective GDPs in 2003.  However, little is known about actual fund flow, \nincluding \u201cinformal flows\u201d between the countries  or the factors  driving choice of remittance \nchannels. For example, officially recorded workers\u2019 remittances from Japan to the Philippines \nare less than that from Japan to Malaysia although registered Filipinos outnumber registered \nMalaysians 10 to 1.  \n \n3.  Overseas remittances have helped countries strengthen their balance of payments and \nthe workers' family members, who are often poor, have benefited from these flows. However, \nthere are few concerns, which, if addressed, will maximize development impact of remittances \nflow. First, making fund transfer easier and cheaper could attract larger flows. Second, directing \nflows from consumption to productive investment would help ensure more sustainability and \neffective use of flows. Third, shifting such financial flows from informal to formal channels would \nreduce the risk of money laundering. \n \n4.  In the past few years, the Inter-American Development  Bank (IADB) commissioned \nstudies on remittance, which led to linking remittance-leveraging activities with funding support \nfrom IADB\u2019s Multilateral Investment Fund. The Global Commission on International Migration, \n                                                 \n1  ADB initiated a general  review study of workers remittance (Meilyn, Kevin. 2003.  Workers Remittances as a \nDevelopment Tool: Opportunity for the Philippines. Manila: ADB.) The study was shared with the APEC Working \nGroup on Alternative Remittance Systems in July 2003. \n2  ADB. 2003. Enhancing the Efficiency of Overseas Workers' Remittances. Manila (TA 4185-PHI, for $150,000, \napproved on 26 September 2003). The final report is available at  http://adbweb/documents/TARs/PHI/tar-phi-\n4185.asp  \n3  The TA first appeared in the Internet edition of ADB Business Opportunities on 4 June 2004. \n4   World Bank. 2003. Global Development Finance 2003. Washington, DC. \n5  Chami, Ralph, Connel Fullenkamp, and Samir Jahjah. 2003. Are Immigrant Remittance Flows a Source of Capital \nfor Development. IMF Working Paper No. 03/189, IMF Institute. Washington, DC. \n ", " 2   \nformed under the auspices of the United Nations (UN), is conducting a scoping study of the \nmany wide-ranging migration issues, including remittances, culminating in a set of findings and \nan action framework for UN member countries to consider in 2005. The first set of consultations \nwith stakeholders in Asia was held in Manila on 17 and 18 May 2004. Although cross-border \nremittance has gained greater attention in the global society in recent years, the related study \nand statistical data of such flows in Southeast Asia are still lacking.  \n   \n5.  Informal  unregulated  money  transfer  systems  have  existed  for  centuries.  The  key \nfeatures, which attract many remitters to choose informal remittance channels, include speed, \nlow  cost,  cultural  convenience,  versatility,  and  anonymity.6 The  study  and  monitoring  of \nunregulated  money  transfer  systems  have  been  challenging  due  to,  for  example,  lack  of \ntransparency or audit trails or difficulty of interpreting informal remittance records. The earlier TA \nsurvey confirmed that the remittance channels patronized by Filipino overseas workers differ by \ncountry of work as well as by their living and working environment. Noticeable alternative \nremittance channels to banks such as money transfer agencies and post offices were used in \nthe US and Japan, respectively. The study  suggested that  about 41% of Filipino workers in \nJapan chose to remit funds through remittance channels other than banks. \n \n6.  In analyzing remittance fund flow, typically, there is a need to examine migrant workers\u2019 \naccess to various remittance channels both in the country where migrant is employed and in the \ncountry where the remittances are transmitted. Also, there is a need to study costs and \nefficiency of remittances and availability of  financial  institutions  or  fund  transfer  agents, to \nreceive funds that were sent to them by the migrant workers. Official fund transfer mechanisms \nhave innovations such as ATM cards, credit cards and the use of cellular phones. International \ndocument courier companies also facilitate official fund transfer. Little is known, however, about \nthe organizations and agencies involved in informal remittance and access to them. Analyzing \nremittance issues is important because remittance can potentially support microfinance projects \nor other poverty reduction programs.  \n \n7.  In the recent ADB  Philippine remittance study, survey results indicated that a high \npercentage (80%) of Filipino remitters regularly channel their remittances, averaging $340 a \nmonth, through the banking or regulated channels. Sending through unregulated channels has \nbeen  reduced,  and  these  are  accessed  mostly  by  workers  where  banking  channels  are \ninadequate  or  who  have  irregular  status.  The  study  revealed  that  developments  in  the \nremittance  industry  allowed  for  vibrant  competition  in  the  remittance  market  between  the \nPhilippines and remitting countries. With the help of technology and marketing, coupled with \nreliable  image,  banks  have  managed  to  reduce  costs  to  levels  that  may  be  considered \ncompetitive with informal channels. These costs could still be pushed down with the entry of \nmore regulated channels and new technology-based products.  \n \n8.  The study concluded that bank and nonbank remittance procedures and remittance \ncosts are affected significantly by legal, banking, and regulatory environments in the Philippines \nand the remitting countries, formal and informal transfer agencies, Philippine payment systems, \nanti-money-laundering  issues,  taxation,  and  other  concerns. Recommendations focused on \nenhancing key areas\u2014government systems, community-based financial institutions such as \nrural banks, cooperatives and microfinance institutions, Filipino hometown associations, and \nnongovernment organizations where remittance-leveraging initiatives could be based. Access to \ninvestment  programs,  savings  mobilization,  credit  access,  enterprise  development,  and \n                                                 \n6  El Qoorchi, Mohamed, Samuel Munzele Maimbo, and John Wilson. 2003. Informal Funds Transfer Systems, An \nAnalysis of the Informal Hawala System. Occasional Paper 222.  Washington, DC: IMF. ", "      3\nreintegration programs could facilitate reintegration of returning migrants into the work force. \nThe predictable flows of more than $7 billion per annum from Filipino workers' remittances could \nbe securitized for development initiatives such as funding of public infrastructure and agricultural \nfacilities,  among  others.  Migrant  origin  and  host  countries  are  key  stakeholders  in  labor \nmigration and should address remittance and migration issues through bilateral initiatives within \nthe ambit of regional economic groupings such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \n(ASEAN) and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC). \n \n9.  The measures to address various negative aspects of the fund transfer are expected to \nbe pursued at the country  and regional levels. In Indonesia, remittances are being carefully \nexamined in relation to ADB\u2019s continued support to the country\u2019s anti-money-laundering efforts, \nand more broadly in the context of overall financial sector reform.  ADB is keenly concerned \nabout the movement of Southeast Asian migrant workers, particularly along the south-south \ncorridors\u2014from Indonesia to Singapore and Malaysia, or from the Philippines to Malaysia and \nSingapore. The regional cooperation strategy and program will address labor movement and \nrelated movement of money through remittances. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n10.  The proposed study would build on  TA 4185  and bring the issue of  remittances and \nconsideration of appropriate actions to the regional level. Based on data on major movements of \nworkers  and  remittances,  it  is  proposed  that  the  study  cover  Indonesia,  Malaysia  and \nPhilippines as the remittance recipient countries; and Hong Kong, China; Japan; Malaysia; and \nSingapore as the source jurisdictions of remittance outflow. Malaysia is peculiar as it is both \nsource and recipient country, receiving large inflows from Japan and Singapore while hosting a \nlarge number of Indonesian and Filipino workers, who send money home. Remittance fund flow \nand the factors affecting how people remit funds vary substantially.  \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n11.  The goal of the TA is to identify ways and means to encourage (i) large remittance flows \nand the effectiveness of its use; and (ii) greater use of formal remittance channels. The purpose \nof the TA is to identify factors in the policy, regulatory, and institutional framework that have an \nimpact on these flows, and propose action plans that can be implemented at the country and \nregional levels to encourage greater remittance fund flow and its formal channeling. The TA will \nexamine (i) estimated movement of remittances through formal and informal channels; (ii) host \ncountry and home country issues; and (iii) existing remittance channels, including the factors \naffecting people\u2019s choice of remittance methods, and the regulatory aspects of remittance \nchannels. The recommendations will be discussed at a regional workshop to confirm that they \ncan be implemented.  \n \n12.  The study is proposed to comprise  the following components: (i) examination of the \nactual and estimated remittance flows through formal and informal channels; (ii) consideration of \nhost country issues; (iii) consideration of home country issues; (iv) examination of the existing \nremittance channels, formal and informal, including their costs, accessibility, and other factors; \n(v)  examination  of  the  regulatory  aspects  relating  to  remittances  in  source  and  recipient \ncountries; and (vi) formulation of the regional action plans to reduce costs and to address other \nfactors that may discourage people from remitting funds through formal channels. \n \n ", " 4   \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The methodology of the study will include a combination of (i) desk studies and reviews \nof relevant legal regulations in the participatory countries; (ii) market research (of factors \naffecting the choice of remittance channels, amount of remittances in relation to income, and \nsatisfaction  in  choice  of  remittance  channels)  in  the  form  of  interviews  and  focus  group \ndiscussions  with  overseas  workers  and  their  families,  government  authorities,  financial \ninstitutions, and nongovernment organizations (NGOs); (iii) a study of successful programs \nimplemented  in  comparable  countries;  and  (iv)  economic  research  of  relevant  key \nfinancial/economic  measures.  The  TA\u2019s  methodology  will  be  harmonized  with  other \norganizations\u2019  to  enable  a  wide  comparison;  the  study  will  take  full  advantage  of  the \ninvestigative and analytical efforts made by other institutions. The TA will draw support from key \ngovernment agencies, overseas workers\u2019 associations, financial institutions, and other relevant \norganizations and institutions involved in fund transfer. The TA will  consult local NGOs and \nhometown associations that may have established linkages with the institutions/organizations \ninvolved in the home country issues as well as in helping recipients make the most effective use \nof  their  funds,  and  learn  innovative  ways  of  linking  overseas  workers\u2019  remittances  to \nmicrofinance activities.  \n \n14.  The  study  will  require  analyses  of  (i)  relevant  laws  and  regulations,  including  the \ninternational agreements signed between the remitting and receiving jurisdictions; (ii) financial \nsector issues such as the availability of banking services, particularly in rural areas; (iii) formal \nremittance channels to identify means to improve the reliability, speed, and cost of remittance \nflows;  (iv)  financing  tools  (such  as  securitization  of  remittance  flows)  to  better  leverage \nremittances;  (v)  lessons  from  mobilization  of  savings  arising  from  remittances;  and  (vi) \neconomic  and  sociocultural  incentives  that  drive  the  remitter  and  recipient  to  channel \nremittances into productive investments. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $500,000 equivalent. ADB will finance the entire \nestimated cost of the TA without explicit counterpart provision.7 However, each participating \njurisdiction is expected to  help  implement  the  TA  by  providing  assistance,  as  well  as  by \nfacilitating the collection of information and data that may already be available within the \ngovernment. The TA will be financed by ADB on a grant basis from Japan Special Fund, \nfinanced by the Government of Japan. The TA will cover the costs of engaging consulting \nservices (remuneration, per diem, and travel) and preparing study reports. The TA will also \nfinance a regional workshop or seminar to disseminate major TA findings and output and to \nconfirm the implementability of proposed recommendations and action plans. The detailed cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA and will administer the TA study. With the \nassistance of a team of consultants, ADB staff will work with government agencies, business \ncommunities, and research institutions in implementing the TA. The TA will be implemented \nover 8 months, from December 2004 to August 2005. The consulting services for the study will \nconsist of two international consultants (total 8 person-months), consisting of (i) a remittance \n                                                 \n7 Operations Manual Section D12/BP, paragraph 36, states: \u201cthe cost sharing policy is not applicable to RETA and   \nsmall scale technical assistance.\u201d ", "      5\nand development specialist, who will act as the consulting team leader (6 person-months); and \n(ii) a banking, financial, and legal regulatory specialist (2 person-months, intermittent). In each \nparticipating  jurisdiction  (Hong  Kong,  China;  Indonesia;  Japan;  Malaysia;  Philippines;  and \nSingapore), country-specific study team leaders will be engaged for a total of 31 person-months, \ncomprising legal, financial, banking, and market research expertise. The in-country consultant \nmay not necessarily have the market research skills as a primary qualification, but rather the \nability to manage a team of sub-consultants to perform the market research. Such national team \nleaders can be nationals of the jurisdiction, or expatriate, as may be appropriate, but they will \nhave an excellent understanding of local conditions and communities.  \n \n17.  The consultants will be engaged as individuals by ADB in accordance with Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants  and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of \ndomestic  consultants.  In  consultation  with  the  remittance  and  development  specialist \n(international study team leader) and ADB staff, each country study team leader will engage \nfield researchers and a few experts to implement the country study. The international study \nteam leader will convene a meeting of the national study team leaders upon their engagement \nto ensure consistency in country- and jurisdiction-specific study approaches. The TA will provide \nfor the engagement of a senior-level administrative assistant to help the international team \nleader and ADB coordinate six national-level study teams and conduct various administrative \nwork relating to TA implementation. The outline terms of reference for the consultants are in \nAppendix 3. All procurement of equipment and materials, and service payments under the TA \nwill be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \n \n18.  Control points will be established during TA implementation, and TA outputs will be \nreviewed and approved by ADB and the participating countries. The consultant team will submit \nan inception report to ADB within 4 weeks of the start of service, assuming that the first meeting \nof the national team leaders and international experts has been completed by that time. The \ninception  report  will  (i)  focus  on  an  initial  assessment  and  prepare  a  realistic  plan  for \nsubsequent action to ensure that the required TA outputs are completed on time; and (ii) make \nadjustments, as appropriate, in other key issues affecting the realization of the TA objectives. \nThese  will  be  identified  through  consultation  with  government  agencies  and  business \nrepresentatives. Interim reports will be submitted to ADB by the end of February 2005 and of \nApril 2005. A draft final report by the consultant team will be completed in May 2005. A regional \nworkshop  or  seminar  will  be  organized  and  conducted  by  the  coordinating  international \nconsultant  to  validate  the  study  findings  and  confirm  the  implementability  of  the \nrecommendations and action plans. The draft final report is expected to be available for \ndiscussion and consultation during the regional workshop or seminar. Consultative meetings will \nbe conducted during TA implementation. The final TA reports will be completed by the end of \nJuly 2005.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n19.
