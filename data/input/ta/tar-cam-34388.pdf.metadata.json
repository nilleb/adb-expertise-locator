The  Government  requested  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  support  further  education \nreform, capacity building, and direct investment assistance as a follow-up to the Education \nSector  Development  Program  (ESDP).1  The  design  of  the  Second  Education  Sector \nDevelopment Program (ESDP II)  will  also use  ADB\u2019s  sector  development  program  (SDP) \nlending modality that combines program lending, project lending, and TA in a single assistance \nwindow. The project preparatory TA is included in the Country Strategy and Program Update \n(2004-2006) as a firm 2003 TA in the amount of $600,000 to be financed under the Japan \nSpecial Fund (JSF).2  \n \n2.  The TA Fact-Finding Mission visited Cambodia from 20 to 29 October 2003 and reached \nunderstanding with the Government on the goal and purpose, scope of work, implementation \narrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference of the TA. The TA supports \nthe Education Strategic Plan (ESP) and the Education Sector Support Program (ESSP), and is \nconsistent with the national poverty reduction strategy (NPRS) of the Government. The ESP is \ncast within the Government\u2019s broader commitment to state reform and is linked to Cambodia\u2019s \ncommitment to achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and Education for All \n(EFA) by 2015. The initial poverty and social analysis is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The priority policy goal of the Government is to achieve EFA, including continued \nstrengthening of primary education, and access to quality and expanded lower secondary \neducation, as well as development of human resources outside the formal education system, \naddressing out-of-school youth and school dropouts. The Ministry of Education, Youth, and \nSports (MOEYS) also recognizes the importance of expanding formal and informal postbasic \neducation opportunities, including market-responsive skills training. The key issues for reforms \ninclude (i) improving the quality and standards of basic education; (ii) maintaining growth in \nlower secondary school enrollment rates, (iii) addressing high levels of dropouts in primary and \nsecondary education; and (iv) further institutional development and capacity building, especially \nin financial management and audit, sector policy development, and performance management.  \n \n4.  There is a need for extending the range of policy reforms, particularly for (i) creating an \nenabling  environment  for  effective  public-private  partnership,  (ii)  legislative  and  regulatory \nreform of the current prevalence of informal school fees, (iii) further financial reforms,  and \n(iv) review of salary and nonsalary spending shares in line with policy and strategic priorities \n(the current 55% salary spending is among the lowest in the world). The Integrated Fiduciary \nAssessment and Public Expenditure Review, 2003 (IFAPER), \u2013 a joint Government, ADB, World \nBank  undertaking,  \u2013  provides  a  broad  financing  and  public  administration  framework  for \nstrengthening the strategic reforms and linkages. The issue is to assist in consolidating recent \ngains and ensure the extension of policy reforms into new strategic areas.  \n \n5.  Primary school net enrollment rate is around 92% and gross enrollment rate is 109%. \nThe World Bank plans to implement its Basic Education Investment Project ($24 million) starting \nin mid-2004. The European Union is due to disburse the first tranche of its Euros20 million grant \nin support of the Government\u2019s basic education budget. Still, there is a substantial lack of \n                                                 \n1   Loan 1864/1865-CAM(SF) (ADB.2001. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on \na Proposed Loan to Cambodia for the Education Sector Development Program. Manila), approved on 4 December \n2001 in the amount of $38 million. A program loan (Loan 1864) of $20 million equivalent supports a policy reform \nprogram, and an investment project (Loan 1865) of $18 million provides facilities development, and support for \nplanning, management, and monitoring. An advisory TA (TA 3858 ADB.2002. Performance Management in the \nEducation Sector, Manila) provides for capacity building in planning, finance, monitoring, and deconcentration of \nauthority. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 13 October 2003.  \n ", "2  \nclassrooms for primary education and there is concern that the EFA target will not be achieved. \nHowever, primary school enrollment (2.7 million today) is expected to decline to about 2.2 \nmillion by schoolyear 2008/09. On the other hand, lower secondary net enrollment rate is only \n20%. Current EFA plans project a growth in grade 6 enrollment from around 0.24 million in \n2002/03 to 0.56 million by 2006/07. With the expected increase in the number of entrants, \nconcern is now on increasing lower secondary school capacity across the country while other \naid agencies actively focus on primary education.  \n \n6.  Envisaged outcomes are policy and strategic options for improving access and quality, \nincluding priority facilities development and associated quality and efficiency measures. This \nassessment will be based on EFA enrollment projections and targets, indicative EFA sectorwide \nfinancing  frameworks,  and  planned  and  projected  support  from  other  aid  agencies  and \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs). The 2003 ESSP review and other studies highlight the \nimportance of continuing quality improvement and strengthening mechanisms for monitoring \neducation standards. There is a need to develop, alongwith other aid agencies minimum \nstandards at various points across grades 1\u20139, together with suitable quality-oriented budget \nallocations and curriculum reform. The latter will build on the initial curriculum development work \nunder the ESDP. The TA will facilitate formulating of policy targets and strategic plans. A related \nissue is the need to strengthen education governance mechanisms, especially to ensure greater \nmutual transparency and accountability for school performance standards. \n \n7.  The ESDP has supported initial expansion of upper secondary education facilities, \nespecially in underserved and overcrowded areas. MOEYS policy is to enable growing public-\nprivate  partnership  for  this  expansion.  MOEYS  recognizes  that  enrollment  growth  could \nstagnate if parental expectations of further education progression cannot be assured. As the \n2003  ESSP  review  highlights,  a  key  requirement  is  to  formulate  equitable  and financially \nsustainable strategies for this expansion, including selective facilities development, financing \npolicy and strategy, and agreed upon governance and management reforms. A cross-cutting \nissue will be to clarify the role of government in ensuring equitable, but merit-driven, access for \nthe poor.  \n \n8.  The recently approved NPRS highlights the urgency of improving employment and \nincome-generating activities for the large number of young people in Cambodia. Currently, there \nare  around  3.1  million  aged  15-29  years  who  are  largely  underemployed  (in  low-level \nsubsistence agriculture or household duties) or unemployed. Only 3% of this age group are \nbenefiting  from  education  opportunities.  A  policy  priority  is  to  expand  formal  education \nopportunities for this age group alongside introducing new formal and informal skills training \nopportunities, e.g., basic entrepreneurial skills, as part of rural economic diversification and \ndevelopment of small to medium-size enterprises. The proportion of the workforce with more \nadvanced professional, technical, and technological qualifications needs to be increased. There \nis also need to ensure improved program articulation, credit transfer and accreditation between \nprograms for optimum utilization of postbasic education institutions (e.g., provincial training \ncenters,  teacher  training  colleges,  women\u2019s  training  centers,  private  sector  training  and \neducation institutions) developed and established in the past 10 years. Alternative approaches \nfor ensuring effective MOEYS policy, financial, and strategic coordination of these activities in \npartnership with other providers need to be examined. \n \n9.  The  Government  has  shown  strong  commitment  to  increasing  public  spending  on \neducation in the past 5 years. The share of recurrent spending on education has increased from \n1% to 2% of the gross domestic product. The recurrent budget share increased from around \n11.5% to 18.5% over the same period. The spending on recurrent program priorities (under \npriority action program [PAP]) has increased from around KR 10 billion ($2.5 million) in 2000 to \nKR 64 billion ($16 million) in 2002. However, a number of outstanding issues still need to be \naddressed: (i) rationalization of PAPs to avoid policy fragmentation, (ii) establishing a more ", "  3\nefficient  disbursement  system  from  national  to  provincial/district  levels;  (iii)  improving \npredictability and reliability of cash releases, and (iv) strengthening financial accounting and \ninternal audit. \n \n10.  The ESDP has been critical in promoting a policy- and results-led approach (vis-\u00e0-vis the \nold project blueprint approach) to education reform in Cambodia over the past 4 years. It has \nfacilitated the strengthening of policy-led education partnership, based on agreed-upon common \npolicy matrixes and targets, which form the basis of the joint annual sector performance review.3 \nThrough the Education Sector Working Group and the National Education Partnership, an \norganization of NGOs active in the education sector in the country, the ESDP has contributed to \nrecognizing the need to institutionalize partnership arrangements. A key role of the TA will be to \nfacilitate policy and strategic dialogue and formulation as part of the anticipated ESP review that \nwill take place in early 2004 alongwith ESDP II preparation. This role is critical in ensuring that \nthe design of both program and investment components is located within a jointly owned, \nrevised ESP scheduled for completion in May 2004. \n \n11.  The TA builds on lessons from previous and ongoing sector investments supporting the \neducation sector, and adopts the sectorwide approach (SWAP) in preparing the project, i.e., \nsector  analysis;  comprehensive  policy  framework,  strategies,  and  support  program; \nperformance  monitoring  with  emphasis  on  outcomes;  organizational  framework  for  aid \ncoordination;  regular  reviews  of  Government-financing  agency  performance;  and  rolling \nadjustments of programs and plans. The TA makes the connection between the earlier project \nand the design and scope of ESDP II, and the logic of continuing the SDP modality. This \napproach positions ADB to help the government move beyond primary education where the \nWorld Bank is also involved and to extend the SWAP to the next higher level subsector in \nanticipation of a full SWAP in the future. The Government and ADB need to reach a common \nunderstanding that the ESSP performance targets are not hard targets, but development goals \nthat  should  be  used  to  develop  forward  strategy  and  retain  the  dynamic  rolling  program \napproach.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n12.  The TA will (i) assist in formulating of the revised ESP and ESSP plans and programs, \nincluding the Medium-Term Expenditure Program (MTEP), for 2004-2008; and (ii) prepare a \nfeasibility study for ESDP  II along the lines of SDP modality. The TA will have three major \ncomponents: (i) strengthening capacity in policy and institutional development; (ii) support for \nlower and upper secondary education; and (iii) formulation of a system for demand-driven, \nnondegree granting community centers for lifelong learning. Community centers will harness the \nresources of divergent training centers, e.g., provincial training centers of MOEYS, women in \ndevelopment centers of the Ministry of Women\u2019s and Veterans Affairs, regional and provincial \nteacher training colleges of MOEYS, and training centers assisted by bilateral assistance and \nNGOs. Community centers will provide (i) credit transfer and accreditation between first year \nhigher education, teacher training, various levels of technical and vocational education and \ntraining (TVET), and nonformal programs; and (ii) occupational and income-generating skills to \nout-of-school  youth  and  school  dropouts.  The  system  is  envisaged  to  offer  occupational \nprograms in support mainly of the agriculture sector, service, and construction industry. There \nare no environmental concerns. \n \n13.  Outputs will include (i) policy dialogue with the Government, related line ministries, and \naid agency partners that will result in strategies  and action plans that will ensure ongoing \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2003.

Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The TA will be consistent with and supportive of MOEYS policy and strategic priorities \nand program framework. It will assist with the policy and program agenda by supporting the \nESP and ESSP review (for 2004-2008). It will finalize a detailed and updated education policy \naction matrix, focusing on further support for lower secondary education, and development of an \nalternative community-based public-private partnership in postbasic education, and links with \nbroader decentralization programs. The TA will build on the achievements of the ESDP, TA \n3858,4 basic education projects of the World Bank, and the experiences of NGOs and bilateral \nagencies in implementing projects in the country. The TA will take into account other activities of \nthe Government, e.g., scholarship program for the poor, and projects of other aid agencies \nactive in the education sector: European Union, United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, Swedish \nInternational  Development  Cooperation  Agency,  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency, \nBelgian  Technical  Assistance,  and  Deutsche  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Technische  Zusammenarbeit \n(German Agency for Technical Cooperation [GTZ]). A feasibility study for ESDP II will be \nprepared according to the following plan: \n \n15.  The TA will be implemented in three phases over 5 months from February 2004 to June \n2004. During phase 1, February 2004, an objective assessment of ESP, ESSP and ESDP, will \nbe undertaken; support for the revision of ESP 2004-2008, and initial policy and SDP framework \nwill be developed. In phase 2, March\u2013May 2004, ESP 2004-2008 will be revised, including \nprovincial and civil society consultation, and detailed components of SDP (program, project \ninvestment,  and  advisory  TA)  will  be  formulated.  Phase  3,  June  2004,  will  involve \ncomprehensive consultations with major stakeholders and beneficiaries at national, provincial, \ndistrict, and village levels (urban, rural, and ethnic minority areas). The ESDP II design and \ncomponents will then be reviewed in a tripartite meeting and finalized. \n \n16.  Capacity building, participatory planning, and stakeholder consultations will be done \nthrough, among others, workshops, conferences, seminars, research, and surveys (e.g., health \nconditions that affect school-age children, integration of HIV/AIDS5 preventive education into the \nschool curricula), and study visits. They will include (i) an inception seminar; (ii) strategic \nseminars;  (iii)  final  review  seminar;  (iv)  task  force  workshops;  (v)  provincial  consultative \nworkshops; and (vi) study visits for concerned government officials to observe model community \ncenters in the region, supply and demand dynamics, and process of establishment. Overseas \nstudy  participants  and  the  scope  of  in-country  workshops  will  be  determined  in  tripartite \nconsultation  with  concerned  government  officials  and  consultants.  The  success  of  project \nimplementation  will  depend  on  MOEYS  leadership,  sense  of  ownership,  and  continued \ncommitment;  effective  coordination  and  working  relationships  among  central  and  local \ngovernment staff; cooperation between local government, civil society, and community groups; \nand availability and full-time participation of counterpart staff and resource persons.  \n                                                 \n4 ADB. 2002.

Cost and Financing \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $790,000 equivalent, comprising $488,000 in \nforeign exchange and $302,000 equivalent in local currency. The Government has requested \nADB to finance $600,000 equivalent covering part of the foreign exchange cost and $175,000 \nequivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan \nSpecial Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. GTZ committed to finance the cost of an \ninternational expert and a local resource person in the amount of $70,000 equivalent and will \nadminister its own funds. The Government will finance the balance of the local currency cost, \nequivalent to $120,000, by providing office accommodation, utilities, and the remuneration and \nper diem of counterpart staff. The Government has been advised that approval of the TA does \nnot commit ADB to financing any ensuing project. Details of the cost estimates and financing \nplan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  MOEYS will be the Executing Agency and will mobilize appropriate policy review and \nproject implementing task forces. The task forces will be part of the agreed-upon ESP and \nESSP revision process. The TA team will report directly to the Secretary of State and MOEYS \nand work with the interministerial ESDP steering committee. In addition to advising on education \nsector planning, the committee will guide the TA team on the general design of the SDP, and \nensure that the proposed investment strategy is in line with Government policies and priorities. \nThe Government will provide suitably qualified counterpart staff. Through the monthly MOEYS-\naid agency consultative meetings, MOEYS will report to aid agencies on the progress of \neducation sector development planning and SDP developments. \n \n19.  The duration of the TA will be 5 months starting in February 2004 and ending in June \n2004. A team of six international consultants (20 person-months) will be recruited individually. \nThe  specialists  (with  person-months  in  parethesis)  will  be  in  (i)  policy  development  and \ninstitutional management (5.0), (ii) planning and financing management (1.5), (iii) education \neconomics (1.5), (iv) occupational programs and community centers development (4.0), (v) \nprogram review and development (5.0), and (vi) nonformal education and microfinance (3.0), \nthe latter to be provided and financed by GTZ. Outline terms of reference for the consultants are \nin Appendix 3. The consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the \nUse  of  Consultants.  The  domestic  resource  persons  (around  35  person-months)  will  be \nidentified as the process and plans evolve, with advice from the steering committee, ESDP task \nforce, and TA consultants\u2019 team. Resource persons will assist the consultants in their respective \nfields of expertise, liaise with concerned ministries and agencies and institutions, and obtain \nnecessary data and information. Office equipment needed to implement the TA will be procured \naccording  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement  and  turned  over  to  MOEYS  upon  TA \ncompletion. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  Cambodia  for  preparing  the  Second  Education  Sector  Development \nProgram, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6          Appendix 1 \nSUMMARY INITIAL POVERTY AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS (IPSA) REPORT \n \nA.

Yes  partnership agreement?  Yes \n   \n \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Cambodia: \n \nUntil 2000, Cambodia had comparatively low education performance indicators, especially for primary and lower \nsecondary enrollment, and efficiency.  In 2001 the Government, with multiagency support, launched an education \nreform initiative under the Education Strategic Plan (ESP) and Education Sector Support Program (ESSP).  Among  \nthe  reforms,  pro-poor  initiatives  included  abolition  of  start-of-the-year  fees,  reduction  in  repetition  rates,  and \nintroduction of poverty-indexed school operating budgets and poverty targeted food aid and scholarships programs.   \n \nThe Education Sector Development Program (ESDP) currently supported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), \nalongwith  other  aid  sources  (e.g.,  European  Commission,  United  Nations  Children\u2019s  Fund  (UNICEF)/Swedish \nInternational  Development  Agency,  World  Food  Program,  Belgian  Technical  Cooperation),  has  contributed  to \nsignificant improvements.  Primary school enrollment increased from 2.2 million to 2.7 million in 3 years, lower \nsecondary enrollment almost doubled from 0.3 million to 0.6 million over the same period.  The recent annual poverty \nimpact analysis indicates that most of this improvement has been in the poorest communes.  It is estimated that an \nadditional 0.6 million children now proceed to the next grade without repetition, with consequent savings to the \nGovernment and parents.   \n \nDespite these improvements, significant poverty-related constraints remain, including lack of facilities in the poorest, \nmore remote, and underserved districts and communes; incomplete primary schools in the same areas; and \ninsufficient resources to expand poverty targeted incentives programs.  The ESDP and the ADB Japan Fund for \nPoverty Reduction (JFPR) program have a significant impact on addressing those issues and have contributed to the \nimprovements outlined above.  The purpose of ESDP II is to consolidate current initiatives and extend them in terms of \nnew poverty targeted strategies and broader coverage, consistent with the Government\u2019s new national poverty \nreduction strategy (NPRS) 2003. \n \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Proposed Classification \n \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?                                                   Poverty Intervention \n \nFurther support is needed for the ongoing annual analysis of poverty impact on education, designed to assess the   \ninfluence of the reform program on poor families, girls, ethnic minorities, and other disadvantaged groups.  In addition,  \nsampled operational research will be conducted to assess the impact at the household level, including changes in \neducation expectations, decision making and priorities, especially for postbasic education opportunities.  \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nStakeholder analysis?  No specific stakeholder analysis studies are needed.  Consultations will take place during the \nTA and the joint annual sector performance review to be conducted by Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports \n(MOEYS), aid agencies and nongovernment organizations (NGOs).   \n \nParticipation strategy required: The participatory assessment will be part of the TA, drawing on the approach and \nsystem adopted by the Education For All secretariat, which has links to the communes, districts and provinces.  The \nongoing UNICEF education microplanning exercise in 2003-2004 will also be used for this purpose. \n \nD.         Gender and Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on poor girls and out-of-school young women: \nThe design of ESDP II will draw on MOEYS gender mainstreaming strategy, involvement and consultations with the \nGender Working Group, and the progress reports of projects supporting girls and women, including the Government\u2019s \nPriority Action Program, ADB\u2019s JFPR scholarships for girls program, and the Belgian technical assistance.  Specific \ninterventions and a gender plan will be prepared during the TA.  The program will be designed to achieve the \nmillennium development goal target of eliminating of gender disparity in education. The Project will (i) consider the \nextent of women\u2019s participation in the intervention and their representation in management; (ii) promote cooperation \nwith women\u2019s groups and NGOs, including those that focus on gender issues; (iii) promote gender training for staff at \nall levels; and (iv) promote gender mainstreaming in the program framework through accessible schools, reduced ", "  Appendix 1  7\nall levels; and (iv) promote gender mainstreaming in the program framework through accessible schools, reduced \ncosts, better quality female teachers, relevant curricula, and responsive delivery and participation of women and men, \ngirls and boys of the communities. \n \n \nE.
