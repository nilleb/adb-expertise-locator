After  the  successful  completion  of  the  Water  Resources  Management  and  Land \nImprovement Project (WRMLIP) in 2006, the Government of Kazakhstan requested1 the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to provide technical assistance (TA) for preparing the Second Water \nResources Management and Land Improvement Project, to increase agricultural productivity and \nprofitability in Makhtaaral raion in Southern Kazakhstan oblast. The proposed project received \nconcept clearance in October 2007.  \n \n2.  A reconnaissance mission from ADB visited Kazakhstan from 19 to 28 June 2007. On the \nbasis of the results of that mission, a memorandum of understanding outlining the basic elements \nof  the  proposed  TA,  including  outputs,  methodology,  cost  and  financing,  implementation \narrangements, and government contribution, was signed. A fact-finding mission visited Astana, \nKazakhstan, from 4 to 6 November 2007 to clarify (i) the required documentation for expertise2 to \nbe  submitted  to  the  Government  before  it  would  approve  funding,  (ii)  the  steps  in  the \nGovernment\u2019s budgeting and approval process, and (iii) Government\u2019s commitment to financing \nthe ensuing project. The fact-finding mission led to the signing of a second memorandum of \nunderstanding clarifying the area coverage of the TA and its implementing arrangements, and \nreiterating the basic elements of the proposed technical assistance.3 The Government confirmed \nits request for ADB technical assistance for the preparation of an 80,000 hectare (ha) project in \nMakhtaaral raion in South Kazakhstan oblast.  \nII.  ISSUES \nA.  Policy Context \n3.  The Government, giving high priority to the processing of agricultural products, has made \nmajor  investments  in  cotton  processing  and  the  associated  textile  industry.  However,  since \nindustrial crops like cotton fully depend on irrigation, agricultural productivity is constrained by \ndilapidated  irrigation  and  drainage  (I&D)  systems,  particularly  in  the  southern  areas,  where \nagriculture could otherwise be highly profitable. \n \n4.  Reforms in the agriculture sector include the restructuring of state and collective farms and \nthe distribution of land and farm assets to former members. Private farms have emerged. Small \n\u201cpeasant\u201d farms, comprising a few households, crop over 40% of agricultural land, and larger \nentities (limited companies and cooperatives) cover the balance. Small household plots are an \nimportant source of production for rural households. But the yields of major crops and livestock \nproducts are low by international standards because of incomplete farm restructuring, lack of \naccess to machinery, inadequate advisory services, insufficient access to affordable credit, and \nthe high costs of transportation over the long distances to markets. \n \n5.  A recent agricultural policy assessment4 emphasized the need for sustainability, efficient \nwater management, and a gradual increase in fees to cover real service delivery costs. To \nachieve these, (i) I&D systems would have to be rehabilitated and modernized; (ii) public and \nprivate institutions involved in irrigation, including water users organizations5 (WUOs), would have \n                                                 \n1  The Government made a formal request on 22 May 2007. \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \n2  Government requires a set of submissions called \u201cexpertise\u201d to support internal project approvals. \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 3 December 2007. \n4  World Bank. 2007. Agricultural Policy Assessment. Joint Economic Research Program (under preparation). \n5  Including rural and consumer cooperatives (RCCs), their umbrella water users federations, limited companies, and \nindividual farmers. RCCs are equivalent to water users associations in other countries. \n ", "2           \nto strengthen their capacity; (iii) irrigation service fees would have to be raised to levels that would \nallow the long-term management and operation and maintenance (O&M) of irrigation systems; \nand (iv) the management of limited water resources would have to improve. \n \n6.  The Government passed two important laws in 2003: (i) the Water Code; and (ii) the Law \non Rural and Consumer Cooperatives of Water Users, which was amended in 2006. Armed with \nthis  legislation,  and  in  view  of  the  importance  of  agriculture  to  the  national  economy  and \nparticularly to the rural population, the Government has embarked on a program to improve the \nefficiency of water use in agriculture and reduce the demand on scarce surface water resources. \nThe strategy is to accelerate the improvement of over a million hectares of irrigated land. A variety \nof  mechanisms  are  envisaged\u2014instituting  water  pricing,  rehabilitating  and  modernizing  I&D \ninfrastructure, establishing water control mechanisms, introducing on-farm water management \npractices, improving agricultural practices, and strengthening the capacity of institutions including \nusers organizations. The policy reforms contained in this legislation will form the core of the \nproposed project. The principal aims will be to establish sustainable management and O&M of \nirrigation and drainage systems, to transfer the management of water use and water infrastructure \nto users, and to recover the cost of water delivery.  \nB.  Subsector Issues \n7.  About 70% of the irrigated lands in the country (about 2.4 million ha) are in southern \nKazakhstan. Population density in the southern oblasts is also among the highest in the country. \nDerelict irrigation and drainage systems have reduced the cultivated area since 1991: only about \n55% of the developed area (about 1.3 million ha out of 2.4 million ha) is now under irrigation.  \n \n8.  Deterioration  of  Irrigation  and  Drainage  Systems.  Inadequate maintenance over a \nnumber of years has left irrigation canals, drains, and structures, as well as access roads and \nbridges, in extremely poor condition. Many systems have been partially or completely destroyed, \nand even those that are still functioning have poorly maintained structures and lack gates, rising \nspindles, and other related mechanical and electrical equipment. These problems extend to the \ndrainage systems, many of which have had very limited maintenance and do not function well. \nLike the canals, most drains are blocked with reeds, weeds, and grasses, and certain sections \nhave silted up. Vertical drainage wells are mostly out of order. As a result, the water table has \nrisen close to ground level and soil salinity has increased. \n \n9.  The Need for Water User Organizations. The privatization of irrigated state farms in \nSouth Kazakhstan oblast without the restructuring of the institutional mechanisms for O&M led to \na complete breakdown of the drainage systems. The WUOs that are to manage the irrigation and \ndrainage systems have yet to be firmly established and to operate, except in recently rehabilitated \nareas.  \n \n10.  Land Degradation and Declining Productivity. Water use efficiency is very low and \ndrainage is also poor, leading to increasing waterlogging and soil salinization. If the water table is \nnot controlled through adequate drainage channels and pumping wells, more land will gradually \nfall out of production. As it is, the irrigated lands that are still being cultivated have declined in \noverall productivity (i.e., crop yields). Better water management to improve water use efficiency \nwill reduce land degradation. However, farmers need to learn better agronomic practices such as \ncrop rotation, crop diversification, and crop husbandry to boost agricultural productivity. \n ", "3 \nC.  Lessons Learned \n11.  Over the past decade, ADB has gained considerable experience in irrigation and drainage \nimprovements in the region, not only in Kazakhstan but also in neighboring countries like the \nKyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. The ADB-funded WRMLIP was designed to support \nthe Government\u2019s policy of privatizing agricultural farms by facilitating the transfer of irrigation and \ndrainage  systems  management  to  private  farmers,  and  increasing  crop  productivity  by \nrehabilitating infrastructure and improving the condition of land in the project area. The project, \nimplemented  in  1998\u20132006  on  39,259 ha  of  irrigated  land,  succeeded  in  rehabilitating  I&D \nnetworks and transferring their management and ownership to WUOs. It was well received by \nbeneficiaries\u2014some 5,000 farm households\u2014and raised expectations for long-awaited follow-on \nimprovements in still unimproved areas in the raion.  \n \n12.   An  important  lesson  from  previous  experience  is  that  a  project  should  establish \norganizational and financial arrangements to sustain the infrastructure after rehabilitation. O&M, \nas well as training, costs should be provided for in WUOs\u2019 operating and equipment budgets. \nMoreover, rehabilitation should not be treated in isolation, and wider support for agricultural \ndevelopment should be considered an integral element of any future project.   \n \n13.  Specific land and water management improvements (e.g., deep ripping, land leveling) are \nconsidered essential to achieving the full benefit of project interventions. However, in some \nprojects these measures are neglected or poorly implemented. Future projects should include \nproper implementation mechanisms to ensure that specific measures are not neglected. With \ncotton so predominant in the Makhtaaral area, there is an urgent need for agricultural extension \nadvice  on  crop  rotation,  diversification,  crop  husbandry,  and  use  of  agrochemicals.  Future \nprojects should include agricultural advisory support to maximize potential benefits.  \n \n14.  Cost recovery details should be well understood by the project beneficiaries at the time \nalternative design options are discussed. Affordability, as well as the cost of sustainable O&M of \nthe infrastructure, should be considered. Beneficiaries should be fully aware of repayment details \nbefore agreeing on preferred rehabilitation measures. \n \n15.  In  the  WRMLIP,  rehabilitation  works  were  undertaken  through  two  large  civil  works \ncontracts with international contractors. This arrangement offered the advantage of securing the \nservices of qualified contractors with the resources to mobilize modern equipment, while also \nallowing smaller works to be implemented through local subcontractors. This same approach, if \nused in future projects will make it possible to deploy modern equipment and transfer skills. \nHowever, there must be safeguards to ensure that the contractors adhere to design specifications, \nconstruct works of the specified quality, and complete their contracted tasks efficiently. Stringent \noversight of construction should be an integral part of any future project. \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n16.  The impact of the proposed project will be sustained improvement in rural livelihood \nthrough improved productivity of agricultural land. \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \n1m7e.m  berTsh, Be ooaurdtc oof mDeire octfo rths,e M TaAna gweilml ebnet , ao r psrtaofjfe, catn dd emsaigyn b ea pnrde lifmeainsaibryi liinty n sattuurdey.   agreed on by the \nGovernment and ADB.  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "4           \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n18.  The TA will adopt a participatory approach and will hold broad consultations with farmers, \nWUOs, local governments,6 and oblast agencies, especially local offices of the Committee for \nWater Resources (CWR).7 Participatory workshops will be held at the raion level, to review the \nstate  of  agriculture,  assess  alternative  design  approaches,  and  discuss  the  findings  and \nrecommendations of the consultants. More intensive workshops and focus groups meetings will \nbe held with farmers, WUOs, private sector, and aid-financed projects, to engender ownership of, \nand agreement on, the detailed design and implementation arrangements. \n \n19.  The TA will proceed from the assessment phase through project design to a study of the \nproject\u2019s engineering, economic, social, and environment feasibility, and finally to the preparation \nof  documentation  for  the  consideration  of  the  Government  and  ADB  Management.  In  the \nassessment phase, economic, social, and institutional aspects of Makhtaaral raion\u2014particularly \nits irrigated agriculture subsector, its I&D systems, and agronomic conditions of irrigated lands\u2014\nwill be assessed. The capacity and governance of relevant institutions will also be evaluated.  \n \n20.  In the project design phase, the project area will be defined and proposed interventions \nidentified, on the basis of the assessments and lessons learned in previous projects, especially \nthe  recently  completed  ADB  WRMLIP.  The  intent  is  to  (i) support  and  strengthen  WUOs, \n(ii) rehabilitate and improve I&D systems, and (iii) achieve sustainable improvements in irrigated \nagricultural productivity.  A  preliminary  design and  monitoring  framework  outlining  the  project \nimpact, outcomes, outputs, and components will be prepared.  \n \n21.  During the feasibility study phase, the following will be prepared: (i) environmental and \nsocial assessments; (ii) engineering surveys and feasibility-level designs, with cost estimates for \ncivil works, design services, goods, and training; (iii) detailed specifications of interventions for \nsustainable support to WUOs, with cost estimates for services, goods, operating costs, and \ntraining; (iv) proposals to strengthen the management and O&M of WUO-owned infrastructure; (v) \ndetailed specifications of sustainable improvements in irrigated agricultural productivity, including \ncost estimates for services, goods, operating costs, and training; (vi) proposals for design and \nconstruction  supervision  services,  including  terms  of  reference;  (vii)  project  management \narrangements,  including  monitoring  and  evaluation procedures;  (viii)  the  final  design  and \nmonitoring framework; (ix) final project cost estimates; and (x) economic and financial analyses to \nestimate the rates of return on investment. The results of the feasibility study phase will be a basis \nfor the documentation of the requirements for construction, ecological management, agriculture, \nand economic expertise, to be submitted to the relevant Kazakhstan government agencies, as a \nprerequisite for government funding, and for project appraisal.  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n22.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $749,000. ADB will finance $600,000 on a grant \nbasis from its TA funding program. The Government will provide $149,000 equivalent through \nin-kind  contributions  of  office  accommodation,  data  compilation,  logistical  support,  and \ncounterpart staff. Detailed cost estimates and financing are in Appendix 3. The Government has \nbeen informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n                                                 \n6  Especially village (selskyi okrug) and raion governments. \n7  The Committee for Water Resources, an agency of the Ministry of Agriculture, is responsible for irrigation and \ndrainage in Kazakhstan. \n ", "5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n23.  The Executing Agency for the TA will be the CWR. A project steering committee, under \nthe CWR chairman and with representatives from the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of \nEconomy and Budget Planning, other relevant government agencies, and the oblast and raion \ngovernments, will be established. The committee will meet regularly to review the proposed \nproject  design  and  the  progress  of  the  TA.  ADB  staff  will  participate  in  steering  committee \nmeetings and, with the committee members and TA consultants, in workshops and tripartite \nmeetings at TA inception, during the midterm review, and during the review of the draft final report. \nCWR will nominate a working group of senior staff members to guide the development of the \nproject design by the TA consultants. The consulting team will be based in the field, and will hold \noffice in Zhetysai (the raion center) and Shymkent (the oblast center). \n \n24.  It is proposed that the TA be undertaken over 6 months, from February 2008 to July 2008. \nAbout 58 person-months of consulting services (18 international and 40 national) will be required. \nThe proposed international experts will include a team leader/economist, an institutional and \nwater  users  association  development  specialist,  an  irrigation  and  drainage  engineer,  a  land \nimprovement specialist, an environment specialist, a social development specialist, and financial \nand economic analyst. The proposed national experts will include a deputy team leader/irrigation \nand drainage engineer, an economist, an institutional specialist, an agronomist, a sustainable \nland management specialist, a rural sociologist, and an environment specialist, as well as other \nspecialists as needed. Outline terms of reference for the consultants are presented in Appendix 4. \nThe  consultants  will  be  hired  as  individuals  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). All procurement under the Project will be \ncarried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). An initial poverty and social analysis has been prepared (Appendix 2).  \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION  \n25.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to the \nGovernment of Kazakhstan for preparing the Second Water Resources Management and Land \nImprovement Project, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n ", "6          Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData \nDesign  Performance  Sources/Reporting  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicatorsa  Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact        Assumptions \n       \nSustained  Increase in crop yield of  National Statistics  Project design is \nimprovement in rural  households from __ to __  Committee  implemented \nlivelihood through      effectively. \nimproved productivity       \nof agricultural land  Reduction in the area of  Monitoring systems of  The Government and \n  degraded lands from __ to  the project and CACILM   ADB sign the loan \n__  agreement. \n   \nOutcome      Assumption \n       \nProject design and  Project design and  Final report  Effective stakeholder \nfeasibility study  feasibility study agreed on   participation and \nagreed on by the  by the Government and  ownership is obtained. \nGovernment and  ADB   \nADB \nOutputs      Risks \n       \n1.

POVERTY ISSUES \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \nA general framework for the project is provided by the 2003 Poverty Partnership Agreement, which includes a midterm \nstrategy (until 2010) that  states: \n\u201cCreation of market-competitive farming and agriculture activities and diversification of the rural economy in the agriculture and \nnon-agriculture sectors\u2026will encompass (a) improving farm and rural enterprise access to domestic and international market; \n(b) rural infrastructure development; (c) upgrading farm technologies, research and extension services with greater private \nsector involvement; (d) deepening sector reforms at local levels; and (e) capacity building for local and national executives, \nand producers\u2019 and community-based associations involved in agriculture and rural development.\u201d \n \nMore recently, the Government has made the development of the agriculture sector a priority as a source of economic \ndevelopment and diversification.  \n \nB.    Targeting Classification          \n  General Intervention    Individual or Household (TI-H);  Geographic (TI-G);  Non-Income MDGs (TI-M1, M2, etc.) \n \nC.  Poverty Analysis \n \nThe technical assistance (TA) will require poverty analysis that is disaggregated by gender. The TA will examine poverty \nincidence using existing data sources, supplemented with a social survey of potential beneficiaries. Both income and non-\nincome poverty indices will be determined. Particular attention in the stakeholder analysis will be given to profiling, for each \ntype of service, the (i) beneficiaries, (ii) adversely affected peoples, and (iii) socioeconomic groups that will not be affected. \nData collected will include, where possible, (i) gender-disaggregated demographic, economic, and social data; (ii) the \nincidence of poverty and vulnerable groups; (iii) ability and willingness to pay for cost recovery; and (iv) any adverse impact \nanticipated from the project. \n \nThe project preparatory TA (PPTA) poverty analysis will focus on (i) analyzing how access to services, markets, and asset \nresources (especially land and credit) is differentiated between the poor and the nonpoor; (ii) identifying ways of improving the \ncontribution of the project to reducing poverty and inequality; and (iii) assessing whether vulnerable groups will be better off or \nworse off as a result of the project, and the need for mitigating measures. The analysis will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Poverty Handbook (2006) and Social Analysis Handbook (2007). The poverty analysis will also examine the links \nbetween poverty and land degradation. \n \nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \nA. Initial Social Analysis \nMakhtaaral raion is predominantly a cotton-growing area and the farmers are relatively well off compared with farmers in other \nparts of Kazakhstan. The population is mostly of Kazakh origin. Incomes have improved in areas that were covered by the \nprevious ADB Water Resources Management and Land Improvement Project.  \n \nThe potential beneficiaries of the proposed project will be the farmers on about 80,000 ha of irrigated lands that have not been \nrehabilitated. In these areas, water users associations are less well organized. The farmers will be organized into water user \nassociations, which will be strengthened through capacity building. Farmers will also receive training in water management, \nsustainable land management, and farm management.  \n \nB. Consultation and Participation \nA participatory approach will be at the core of the PPTA, for the purpose of (i) collecting data, and (ii) making collaborative \ndecisions about project designs with key stakeholders. Participatory rural appraisal techniques will be used during the \nassessment and design phases. \n \n ", "  Appendix 2           9 \nThe participatory approach will involve broad consultation with farmers, water user organizations, local governments, and \nrelevant agencies at raion and oblast levels, especially local offices of CWR. Participatory workshops will be held at the raion \nlevel, to review the state of agriculture, assess alternative design approaches, and discuss the findings and recommendations \nof the consultants. More intensive workshops and focus groups meetings will be held with farmers, WUOs, the private sector, \nand government agencies implementing aid-financed projects to engender ownership of, and agreement on the detailed \ndesign and implementation arrangements. \nWhat level of participation is envisaged for project design? \n     Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making         Empowerment \n \nC.
