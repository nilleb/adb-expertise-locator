A project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) is needed to: (i) assess the current \nstatus of the transport sector; (ii) analyze the operational effectiveness and efficiency of the \nMinistry of Infrastructure Development (MID) and other stakeholders including transport system \nowners and operators and the public; and (iii) identify required actions to improve the national \ntransport systems. An ensuing program to be assessed and developed by the PPTA is expected \nto  produce  benefits  for  populations  in  rural  and  urban  areas  through  facilitating  the \nestablishment of an improved transport sector capacity required to sustain improved mobility \nand accessibility to socioeconomic opportunities through achieving key policy reform actions \nfocusing on strengthening transport sector development, finance investments, and providing \ncomprehensive technical assistance for implementation. \n \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n2.  The PPTA will carry out required assessments and due diligence, including all economic, \nfinancial, technical, governance, social and poverty, and safeguards.
