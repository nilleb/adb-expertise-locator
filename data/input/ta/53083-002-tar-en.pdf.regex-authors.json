THE ENSUING PROJECT \n \nThe upcoming reform of the post-secondary sector in Papua New Guinea (PNG) through the \nproposed Higher and Technical Education Reform Act 20191 will provide for a new governance \nand management framework for teacher training and Technical and Vocational Education and \nTraining (TVET) colleges with increased independence in management and leadership and closer \npartnerships with industry and business. The proposed Improved TVET for Employment will be \naligned with the current sector reform priorities and address the need to strengthen the building \nblocks for effective TVET institutions that will provide increased employment opportunities for \nPNG nationals. The following output areas are expected to be delivered: (i) TVET institutions \ngovernance and management strengthened; (ii) quality TVET teacher training and development \nprovided;  (iii)  TVET  infrastructure/equipment  supporting  priority  programs  and  industry \nrequirements  developed;  and  (iv)  national  level  mechanisms  for  employment  partnerships \ndeveloped. The total indicative cost for the project is $55 million, of which $35 million in ordinary \ncapital resources and $15 million in concessional lending resources is proposed for funding from \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB). It is expected that the government will allocate estimated \n$5.0 million worth of in-kind contribution during the duration of the project. Potential cofinancing \nfrom other development partners such as the Government of Australia will be explored.   \n \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n2.       The proposed transaction technical assistance (TRTA) will provide technical analysis and \nassessments to assist the government and the ADB to develop the proposed Improved TVET for \nEmployment. The TRTA is justified given the scope of activities and specialist nature of skills \nrequired for the assessment. The project preparation will also require consultations with various \nstakeholders such as private companies, business associations, and communities to ensure that \nit will be in line with the current and future demand for TVET skills. Due diligence will be \nundertaken based on the proposed project design. The TRTA will also build the capacity of the \nDepartment of Higher Education, Research, Science and Technology (DHERST) to implement \nthe ensuing project and enhance project readiness for timely implementation start-up given ADB\u2019s \nrelatively new engagement with DHERST. The TA is included in the ADB\u2019s country operations \nbusiness plan for PNG.2 \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n3.  Output 1: Project scoping and design completed. This output will develop the project \nincluding scoping and designing of key project components to meet the desired outcome of \nstrengthened TVET institutions to provide increased employment opportunities for PNG nationals \nin priority sectors, such as construction trade and agriculture/agribusiness, within the context of \nthe Higher and Technical Education Reform Act 2019. The project will focus on selected technical \ncolleges deemed by the government as potential Centers of Excellence to nurture other TVET \nschools and institutions within the geographic or technical area.3 It will  address key foundational \nissues  such as (i) assisting the autonomy and effectiveness of  TVET institutions by building their \n                                                \n1  This is expected to take into effect on 1 January 2020.  \n2  ADB. 2018. Country Operations Business Plan: Papua New Guinea, 2018-2020. Manila. \n3  Indicative priority institutions include: Port Moresby Technical College, Bougainville Technical College, Madang \nTechnical College, Mt Hagen Technical College, Highlands Agricultural College, Goroka Technical College, PNG \nNational Polytechnic Institute, West New Britain Technical College, Western Province Technical College and Don \nBosco Technical Institute.  \n ", "2 \nmanagement and governance capacities and partnership with industry and the community; (ii) \nbuilding the capacity and qualification of TVET teachers especially in priority sectors and set-up \na mechanism to address their training and development needs in a sustainable manner; (iii) \nsupporting TVET priority sectors and required program offers, infrastructure and equipment \nrequirements to ensure an industry demand-driven TVET-approach; (iv) assessing incentives and \nbarriers to participate in TVET especially for women and low-income families; and (v) developing \nnational mechanism for employment partnerships in large infrastructure. At the same time, the \nscoping exercise will determine the most effective sequencing of outputs and strategic alignment \nand collaboration with the ongoing education and TVET programs of other development partners, \nprivate institutions, and government within the context of the overall sector reform. Particularly, \ncomplementarity with the Government of Australia\u2019s TVET support in PNG such as the Skills for \nGrowth Program will be ensured. The project design will also draw from the key lessons learned \nand  best  practices  in  implementing  similar  projects  in  PNG,  assess  the  capacity  of  the \nimplementing agency and concerned government offices involved and identify the implementation \nmodality that will best deliver the project outputs.  \n \n4.  Output 2:  Project due diligence undertaken. The TA will support all required due \ndiligence based on the project design. It is expected to be done concurrently with finalizing the \nscope  as  some  findings  might  lead  to  adjustments  in  the  design  with  financial  and  cost \nimplications. Due diligence includes economic and financial assessment, poverty, social and \ngender  analysis,  safeguards  assessment  and  instruments,  financial  management  and \nprocurement capacity assessment, risk assessment and management plans; cost estimates and \nfinancing plan and project implementation arrangements including monitoring and evaluation, \namong others.  Based on these assessments and analyses, all the required project and linked \ndocuments will be prepared based on ADB requirements and standards.   \n \n5.  Output 3: Support to project readiness and project management capacity of the \nimplementing agency. This output will support project preparation and readiness by providing \nfor an advisory role in finalizing the design of the project, overall implementation arrangements \nand  assessing  implementation  risks  and  recommending  effective  mitigation  measures,  in \ncoordination with key government and relevant industry stakeholders. This output also includes \nassisting the government during project start-up, such as preparation for the recruitment of a \nproject management unit, managing the mobilization period and preparing any draft bidding \ndocuments required and providing coordination support with key government agencies and other \nrelevant stakeholders such as sharing the outcome of the TRTA and soliciting inputs and \nconcurrence where necessary. The capacity of the executing and implementing agencies for \nproject preparation and implementation will also be strengthened and how to enhance the existing \nmanagement  information  system  will  be  assessed.  Key  activities  include  (i)  assessing  the \ninstitutional capacity and set-up and identifying gaps with regards to project preparation and \nimplementation; and (ii) organize training, capacity building exercises and activities to address \nidentified gaps and areas requiring improved capacity. \n \nTable 1: Summary of Major Outputs and Activities \nMajor Outputs  Delivery Dates  Key Activities with Milestones \n1.

Cost and Financing \n \n6.  The TA is estimated to cost $ 1,092,400, of which (i) $800,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6) and (ii) AUD430,000 ($292,400 \nequivalent) will be financed on a grant basis by the Government of Australia and administered by \nADB.4 The government will provide in-kind support in the form of counterpart staff, office space, \ndata,  information,  and  other  in-kind  contributions.  The  key  expenditure  items  are  listed  in \nAppendix 1. The government was informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to \nfinance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n7.  ADB will administer the TA.
