The countries in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS)\u2014comprising Cambodia, Lao \nPeople's Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Thailand, Viet Nam, and Yunnan Province of the \nPeople's Republic of China\u2014established a Working Group on Agriculture (WGA) in January \n2003  to  facilitate  consultations  on  common  issues  in  the  agriculture  sector  and  identify \nopportunities for increased regional cooperation. On the basis of discussions at the meetings of \nthe WGA in 2002 and 2003, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) conducted a rapid assessment \nof agricultural biotechnology in GMS in November 2003.1 As a result of the assessment and \nsubsequent consultations, ADB and GMS countries reached an understanding on the objective, \nscope, financing plan, and implementation arrangements for this Technical Assistance (TA).2 \nThe TA is included in ADB\u2019s regional cooperation strategy and program (2004\u20132008) for GMS. \nThe TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  GMS countries had an average rate of gross domestic product growth of more than 5% \nper annum during the last 5 years, and fully recognize the need for sustainable agricultural \ngrowth to maintain economic strength and reduce poverty in the region, where about 62 million \nor  25%  of  the  total  population  live  below  the  poverty  line.  In  addition,  there  are  growing \nconcerns in GMS about (i) widening gaps between rural and urban areas, and between rich and \npoor people; (ii) unsustainable management of the environment, which provides livelihood for \nrural communities; and (iii) special needs of vulnerable ethnic minorities in rural areas. Providing \nincreased economic opportunities in rural areas will be crucial in addressing these concerns. \nDue to increased globalization of trade in agricultural and agro-based commodities as reflected \nin the recent entry of some GMS countries in the World Trade Organization (WTO), more \neffective  use  of  advanced  agricultural  science  and  technology  is  required  to  ensure  food \nsecurity,  and  promote  agricultural  diversification  and  commercialization.  Use  of  advanced \nscience and technology will also increase the access of GMS products to international markets \nthrough improvement of food safety and quality standards, and lead to higher production values \nthrough identification of innovative products and marketing. \n \n3.  Advanced agricultural science and technology, in particular agricultural biotechnology,3 \noffers an opportunity, largely untapped, to sustainably increase productivity and food supply, \nand will contribute to addressing food security issues and reducing poverty in GMS. The use of \ntechnology has the potential to increase plant and animal productivity, improve product and \nnutritional quality, enhance crop resistance to pesticides and herbicides, and increase crop \ncapacity to grow in difficult soil conditions. Researches into molecular genetics resulted in new \ntechniques for more precise and rapid improvements in economically important strains of crops. \nOther  biotechnology  applications  like  micropropagation  form  the  basis  for  large-scale \nmultiplication of improved plant varieties. \n \n4.  However, diverse views on agricultural biotechnology still exist often because of limited \naccess  to  accurate  knowledge  and  scientific  information.  The  public  is  concerned  about \npotential health and environmental risks related to the use of agricultural biotechnology, for \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004. Agricultural Biotechnology in the Greater Mekong Subregion (Working Paper). Manila. The study was \ncarried out by Cornell University. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 9 September 2004. \n3  Broadly defined as application of any agricultural technology that uses biological systems, living organisms, or \nderivatives thereof, to make or modify products for specific use. This definition is used in the Convention on \nBiological Diversity adopted at the 1992 Earth Summit. ", "2 \nexample, creation of super weeds, increased antibiotic resistance, and occurrence of allergies. \nAppropriate policy and regulatory frameworks are also required to ensure that such technology \nis used safely and potential risks are minimized. Improved policy and regulatory frameworks will \npromote public-private partnerships for advanced research and development, and enhance \nknowledge and skills to benefit smallholders, increase productivity, and upgrade food safety and \nproduct quality standards. \n \n5.  ADB conducted a comprehensive study of agricultural biotechnology in 2000 to explore \nits  potential  in  food  security  and  poverty  reduction.4  The  study  highlighted  the  need  for \ncontinued public and private investment in biotechnology development as a means to facilitate \npoverty reduction and food security in Asia, and to strengthen the extension services and the \nregulatory  framework  to  deliver  the  benefits  of  advanced  technology  to  small  farmers.  In \nNovember  2003,  ADB  also  carried  out  a  rapid  assessment  of  the  situation  of  agricultural \nbiotechnology  in  GMS.  The  assessment  highlighted  the  urgent  need  to  (i)  increase \nunderstanding and knowledge of biotechnology issues in all GMS countries, (ii) ensure that \nappropriate policies and regulatory frameworks are in place, and (iii) strengthen the technical \ncapacity of relevant agencies and research institutes in agricultural science and technology. The \nassessment also indicated that inequalities that currently exist in the level of technology and \nprivate  enterprise  development  and  in  preparedness  in  terms  of  legal  and  regulatory \nframeworks among GMS countries should be considered in formulating assistance programs \nsuitable for the situation of each country. \n \n6.  Inadequate understanding and knowledge will substantially limit the use of advanced \nagricultural science and technology, and may result in inappropriate systems for technology \ndevelopment and unregulated flows of uncertified crop seeds and products, which may cause \necological and health problems. As of August 2004, all GMS countries had either signed or \nratified the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, agreeing to protect biological diversity from the \npotential  risks  posed  by  genetically  modified  organisms  (GMOs)  resulting  from  modern \nbiotechnology,  including  agricultural  crops  that  have  been  genetically  modified  for  greater \nproductivity or for resistance to pests or diseases.5 The Protocol encourages the participating \ncountries to establish rules and procedures for the transfer, handling, and use of GMOs under \nconditions of safety, particularly for their cross-border movement. At present, GMS countries are \nat various stages of formulating relevant laws and regulations to implement the Protocol. \n \n7.  Establishment of the legal framework for protecting intellectual property rights (IPRs) \nrelating  to  biotechnology  is  also  being  debated  globally  in  view  of  the  need  for  ensuring \nappropriate returns for private investment in biotechnology research and development, and for \nfacilitating access of resource-poor farmers to improved technology and its benefits. These \nfactors need to be taken into account in the discussion on the regulatory framework for IPR \nprotection  in  collaboration  with  other  agencies,  including  WTO  and  the  United  Nations \nEnvironment Programme (UNEP). \n \n8.  In relation to the use  of advanced agricultural science and technology, appropriate \nsystems to ensure food safety need to be established and strengthened to make food products \nfree from possible health risks from GMOs, insecticide residues, harmful synthetic agents and \nadulteration. The quick analysis of these substances, whose use is becoming rampant in Asia, \nis urgently required with effective enforcement measures. In addition, the methods for post-\nharvest preservation of fresh foods need to be constantly upgraded to meet stringent product \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2001. Agricultural Biotechnology, Poverty Reduction, and Food Security (Working Paper). Manila. \n5  Convention on Biological Diversity. 2000. Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety (Supplementary Agreement). Montreal. ", "    3 \nstandards in international markets. Disseminating correct information and upgrading analytical \nskills for detection of harmful substances and GMOs are urgently needed in GMS countries. \n \n9.  Other international and regional agencies provide GMS countries with technical and \nfinancial assistance programs for improving national systems to ensure biosafety and food \nsafety standards. Since June 2001, UNEP, under the Global Environment Facility, has assisted \ncountries to develop national frameworks to effectively regulate and administer activities for \nbiosafety. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) assists ASEAN countries in \nfacilitating the safe cross-border movement and use of GMOs through harmonization of national \nregulations  and  guidelines.  The  United  Nations  Food  and  Agriculture  Organization  (FAO) \nprovides  capacity-building  support  to  enhance  food  security  and  increase  farmers'  income \nbased on safe and judicious use of modern biotechnology. In the area of food safety, ASEAN \ncollaborates  with  the  European  Union  and  the  Government  of  Japan  to  support  regional \nactivities in ASEAN to upgrade and harmonize food standards and control enforcements, and \nreduce technical barriers to trade of food products. FAO and the World Health Organization, \nwhich help implement the activities of the Codex Alimentarius Commission (Codex) relating to \ninternational food safety standards, will support some GMS countries to increase awareness \nabout food safety issues and improve technical capacity in food analysis. As there are similar \ninitiatives by bilateral agencies and international agricultural research centers (IARCs), this TA \nwill hold special efforts like joint seminars and workshops to ensure effective coordination and \ncomplementarity with the activities of other agencies. \n \n10.  The long-term cooperation framework of GMS countries emphasizes that a series of \ninfrastructure projects should be closely linked with agriculture development at the national \nlevel, and that regional issues in the agriculture sector should be effectively addressed. The TA \nis in line with this long-term framework to realize the potential of GMS countries, and ensure \nequitable and sustainable development processes through increased regional cooperation. The \nTA will also help promote private sector participation in the agriculture sector, and improve \nfarmers' access to advanced agricultural science and technology. The TA is strongly supported \nby GMS countries, and will further promote the WGA work program. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n11.  The TA will strengthen capacity and regional cooperation for the safe use of advanced \nagricultural science and technology and for the related food safety in GMS countries, thereby \ncontributing to sustainable agricultural growth in the region. At TA completion, it is expected that \n(i) basic awareness about advanced agricultural science and technology and related food safety \nissues will be increased among key stakeholders in GMS countries, (ii) the technical capacity of \nthe relevant institutions in GMS will be strengthened, and (iii) appropriate policy and regulatory \nframeworks will be enhanced in GMS countries.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.  The TA will have the following components: \n(i)  Basic awareness-raising activities. This component will aim at disseminating \naccurate information and knowledge about the benefits and risks in the use of \nagricultural  biotechnology  and  agrochemicals.  Representatives  of  agricultural \nproducers and consumers will be the primary targets of these activities. Use of ", "4 \nmass media and web sites for wider public campaigns may be considered to \nincrease general awareness.6 \n(ii)  Advanced  technical  training  programs.  Training  programs  on  advanced \ntechnical subjects will be provided for staff of the relevant government agencies, \nand  research  and  academic  institutions.  Provision  of  practical  hands-on \nexperience in tissue culture, molecular breeding, food microbiology, and GMO \ndetection  with  the  use  of  well-equipped  laboratory  facilities  in  GMS  will  be \nconsidered  for  the  regional  training  programs.  Since  the  appropriate  use  of \nbiotechnology requires adequate capacity and knowledge of conventional plant \nbreeding techniques, priority may be given to training programs on conventional \ntechniques  in  some  GMS  countries.  Balanced  gender  representation  will  be \nconsidered in selecting participants for the awareness-building activities, and the \ntraining programs. \n(iii)  Regional  dialogue  on  common  strategy  and  country  action  plans.  In \ncoordination with the discussions of the WGA, the TA will enhance their regular \npolicy dialogue on relevant topics such as informal cross-border flow of GMOs, \nenforcement of biosafety regulations, and IPR protection. \n(iv)  Support for enhanced policy and regulatory frameworks. The TA will assist \nGMS countries in organizing necessary workshops to establish and strengthen \nappropriate policy and regulatory frameworks for biosafety, IPR protection, and \nfood safety. This activity will be carried out in close consultation with WTO, \nUNEP, and IARCs. In relation to this, necessary technical and advisory support \nfor strengthening and institutionalizing information and monitoring systems will be \nprovided to GMS countries. \n \n13.  A longer-term framework for collaboration between GMS countries and ADB on the \nregion's common issues in the agriculture sector is being established. Improved capacity in \nadvanced agricultural science and technology is one of the high-priority issues in the region as \nindicated  during  the  WGA  meetings.  Under  the  TA,  advanced  technical  knowledge  and \nexpertise, and well-equipped facilities existing in GMS countries will be fully utilized to achieve a \nsustainable  framework  for  cooperation  in  GMS.  As  the  training  and  awareness-building \nprograms to be implemented under the TA cover a wide range of specialized subjects, the TA \nprograms will feature resource persons with highly technical and specialized knowledge from \nthe relevant research institutes, academic institutions, and other organizations in GMS and \ncountries of other regions. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,200,000 equivalent, comprising $726,000 in \nforeign  exchange  and  $474,000  equivalent  in  local  currency.  ADB  will  provide  $1,000,000 \nequivalent  to  finance  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  and  part  of  the  local  currency  cost, \namounting to $274,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan \nSpecial Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The balance of the local currency costs, \namounting to $200,000 equivalent, will be met by GMS governments in kind to cover counterpart \nstaff  support,  training  and  seminar  facilities,  and  office  and  administrative  expenses.  The \nGovernment of Thailand indicated it would consider financing part of the local currency cost of \nthe TA, and selected training programs proposed under the TA. Detailed cost estimates are in \nAppendix 2. \n \n                                                 \n6  In this context, the proposed use of mass media and web sites under the TA can be linked to the establishment of \nan agricultural cooperative network in GMS proposed by the Government of the People's Republic of China. ", "    5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA. All six GMS countries will be participating in \nthe  TA.  Their  governments  will  designate  their  implementing  agencies  from  the  relevant \nministries,  research  institutes,  or  academic  institutions.7  The  WGA  coordinators,  who  are \nnominated by their respective GMS governments as national focal points for implementing WGA \nactivities,  will  be  fully  involved  in  the  TA  to ensure  close  coordination  among  stakeholder \nagencies.  To  involve  a  wide  range  of  stakeholders  in  the  respective  countries,  GMS \ngovernments will establish a national task force or committee at TA inception to formulate or \nstrengthen biosafety policy and regulatory frameworks, or use the existing national committee \nfor this purpose.  \n \n16.  The TA will be implemented over 2 years from April 2005. The TA will require 28 person-\nmonths of international and 42 person-months of domestic consulting services. The international \nspecialists  (person-months  are  given  in  parenthesis)  will  have  expertise  in  agricultural \nbiotechnology and team leadership (20), biosafety policy (2), food safety (3), and information \nand monitoring systems (3). The domestic specialists from GMS countries will have expertise in \nagricultural  biotechnology  (16),  food  safety  (9),  information  and  monitoring  systems  (9), \nenvironment (4), and social analysis (4). An academic institution, an international or regional \nresearch center, or other organizations, which are technically well-qualified to implement the \ntasks of the TA, will provide the specialist services required under the TA. The TA will also use \ntechnical resource persons and facilities available in GMS. A team of specialists will be selected \nand  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic specialists. The quality- and cost-\nbased selection method will be used, and simplified technical proposals invited from the short-\nlisted institutions. Necessary office and laboratory equipment will be purchased in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \n \n17.  Regional  tripartite  review  meetings  involving  GMS  government  representatives,  the \nspecialists engaged under the TA, and ADB will be organized at least three times during the TA \nperiod to discuss the inception, midterm, and draft final reports to review the progress and outputs \nof  the  TA,  and  resolve  any  implementation  issues.  ADB  will  field  TA  review  missions  in \nconjunction with these tripartite review meetings. The specialist team will prepare (i) an inception \nreport including a detailed work program, to be submitted within 1 month of the start of the TA; \n(ii) a midterm report on the TA activities during the first year and any revisions of the TA work \nprogram, to be submitted at the end of the first year; (iii) a draft final report about 2 months \nbefore TA completion; and (iv) a final report upon completion of the TA. The specialist team of \nthe TA will also prepare brief quarterly progress reports based on the format agreed upon at TA \ninception, and technical working papers as required under the TA. The final report will be \ntranslated into the respective languages of GMS countries as required. The TA outputs will also \nbe reviewed by ADB's sector committee for agriculture and natural resources. The outline terms \nof reference for the specialists are in Appendix 3. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis \nfor Strengthening Capacity and Regional Cooperation in Advanced Agricultural Science and \nTechnology in the Greater Mekong Subregion, and hereby reports this action to the Board.\n                                                 \n7  The specialist team engaged under the TA will be stationed mainly at the National Science and Technology \nDevelopment Agency of Thailand during the TA period.
