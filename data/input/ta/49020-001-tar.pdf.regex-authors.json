INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  Government  of  Mongolia  requested  technical  assistance  (TA)  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to enhance management and implementation of Mongolia\u2019s education \nsector reforms with an emphasis on equity of access to quality education. During the missions \nconducted in February and April 2015, ADB  and the government reached agreement on the \nobjectives, scope, implementation arrangements, costs, and terms of reference for consultants. \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1 The TA is included in ADB\u2019s country \noperations business plan, 2014\u20132016 for Mongolia.2  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Since the 1990s, ADB has been providing assistance to the Ministry of Education, Culture, \nand Science (MECS) in addressing changing priorities and challenges in the education sector. \nFrom 2006 to 2014, ADB loan and grant operations supported major education sector reforms, \nincluding  the  expansion  of  Mongolia\u2019s  education  system  from  11  to  12  years  in  line  with \ninternational standards, and the country\u2019s ongoing education sector quality reform.3 Mongolia has \nmade significant progress in improving access to education, as evidenced by the net enrollment \nratio in school year  2014\u20132015\u201497% (97% for girls and 98% for boys) at the primary level and \n92% (92% for girls and 91% for boys) at the secondary level\u2014which compare favorably with those \nin  other  lower  middle-income  countries.4 However,  remaining  issues  include  the  quality  and \nrelevance of education, and disparities in access to quality educational resources and learning \nopportunities among students.  \n \n3.  In 2012, the MECS initiated education sector quality reform at the preprimary, primary, and \nsecondary levels. At that time, transition from an 11-year to a 12-year education system was \nexpected to be completed by school year 2014\u20132015 with the promotion of the first cohort of \nstudents  to  12th  grade.  Through  the  reform,  the  MECS  intended  to  address  emerging  post-\ntransition issues related to: quality of student learning; equity (\u201cno child left behind\u201d):5 diversification \nof individual student needs; school-to-work transition; and effectiveness of education governance \nwith a greater involvement of parents, communities, civil society organizations, and the media. \nHowever, effective policy measures largely remain yet to be devised.  \n \n4.  Currently, at the center of the reform is the introduction of new core curricula\u2014organized by \nskill or competence that students must acquire by the end of preprimary, primary, and junior and \nsenior secondary education through different subjects to be taught in an integrated manner\u2014which \nwas first developed for the primary level and piloted in school year 2013\u20132014 in 40 laboratory \nschools. The core curricula have been implemented nationwide at the primary level since school \nyear 2014\u20132015. Core curricula for preprimary and junior secondary education were developed in \nschool  year  2014\u20132015  and  have  been  piloted  since  then.  In  school  year  2015\u20132016,  core \ncurricula for preprimary and junior secondary education will be implemented nationwide, and in \nschool year 2016\u20132017, core curricula for senior secondary education will be piloted. In addition to \nthe core curricula, the reform has introduced new elements to the Mongolian education system, \nincluding  new  teaching\u2013learning  approaches,  textbooks,  standards  for  school  environments, \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 16 April 2015.  \n2  ADB. 2014.

Completion \nReport: Education Sector Reform Project in Mongolia. Manila. \n4  The school year in Mongolia officially starts on 1 September and ends on 1 June. \n5  According to the education sector reform policy framework, 2012\u20132016 of the MECS, no student, regardless of gender, \nfamily background, or socioeconomic or disability status, shall be disadvantaged in learning with the introduction of \nnew child-centered teaching approaches. \n ", "2   \nguidelines for school management, methods of continuous professional development for teachers, \nand evaluation and assessment system. \n \n5.  The MECS has led this reform in education quality together with (i) reform management \nteams comprising staff of the Institute of Education, Teacher Development Institute, Educational \nEvaluation Center, and Mongolian State University of Education;6 and (ii) a reform implementation \nteam comprising experienced teachers mostly based in aimags (provinces). The reform has been \nimplemented by the reform implementation team, working closely with 40 laboratory schools, the \nmajority  of  which  were  originally  selected  under  the  Mongolia\u2013Cambridge  Education Initiative \nlaunched in 2009 with a view to align Mongolia\u2019s education system with international standards.7 \nThe reform implementation team, together with the laboratory schools, has been piloting the core \ncurricula, demonstrating new teaching\u2013learning approaches, advising school management, and \norganizing knowledge and experience sharing workshops for teachers at laboratory and non-\nlaboratory schools.  \n \n6.  Despite the establishment of the education sector reform policy framework, 2012\u20132016, \nwhich aims to meet individual student learning needs and leave no child behind, specific measures \nneed to be adopted to address equity of access to quality education, defined as providing all \nstudents, regardless of gender, family background, socioeconomic or disability status, with access \nto quality educational resources and opportunities to learn. Issues related to equity of access to \nquality education that require special attention include:  \n \n(i)  Differences  in  teaching-learning  environment:  The  organization  of  teaching-\nlearning environment within schools differs significantly across schools, depending \non  the  availability  of  basic  infrastructure  and  space,  management  of  financial, \nhuman and physical resources, and relationships between schools, communities \nand parents. Unfavorable teaching-learning environment affects student learning.  \n(ii)  Varying levels of teachers\u2019 skills and understanding of the core curricula: \nImplementation of the core curricula places a greater demand on teachers\u2019 skills in \nassessing  student  needs,  preparing  lessons,  delivering  classes,  and  assessing \nstudent learning. However, teachers\u2019 skill levels and their understanding of the core \ncurricula vary greatly, which poses a challenge in providing equal access to quality \nlearning opportunities for all students.  \n(iii)  Disparities  in  financial,  human,  physical  resources: There are disparities in \nfinancial, human, and physical resources distributed across schools and students. \nThese disparities influence the implementation of the core curricula and access to \nquality educational resources.  \n(iv)  Socioeconomic background of students: A national assessment of mathematics \nand  reading  at  the  primary  level  conducted  in  2008  shows  that  the  following \ncategories of students are disadvantaged in learning: students in rural and ethnic \nminority  schools;  students  living  in  dormitories  or  with  foster  families;  students \nentering school at the age of 7 or 8 rather than the official school entry age of 6.8  \n \n7.  In 2002, national education budgets were recentralized. In 2014, Parliament approved the \ndecentralization of recurrent budget responsibility to the metropolitan and aimag levels. With the \n                                                \n6  These are public institutions supervised by the MECS.  \n7  The  Mongolia\u2013Cambridge  Education  Initiative  consisted  of  two separate interventions: (i) introduction of Cambridge  \nInternational  Examinations  qualifications (the  International  General Certificate  of Secondary  Education and  the \nInternational A-Level qualification) in a couple of bilingual schools; and (ii) development of Mongolian national \ncurriculum and assessment system based on the Cambridge International Examinations Standard Qualifications. \n8  Government of Mongolia, Educational Evaluation Center. 2008. Mongolia\u2013National Assessment of Primary Education \nMathematics and Reading. Ulaanbaatar. \n ", "  3 \ndecentralization, metropolitan  and  aimag governments  are  expected  to  play  a greater role  in \nallocating budgets to schools, supporting the implementation of the core curricula, and promoting \nequal  access  to  quality  education  for  all  students.  However,  the  capacity  of  local  education \ndepartments has yet to be strengthened to provide professional and methodological guidance for \nschools in line with the education sector reform policy framework. The policy framework also calls \nfor the Institute of Education to become a leading institution in providing support for schools and \npolicy makers by conducting research on curricula, teaching\u2013learning approaches, assessments, \nand teacher training. However, its research capacity still needs to be enhanced. \n \n8.  This TA is aligned with MECS\u2019s education sector reform policy framework, 2012\u20132016. It is \nalso consistent with ADB\u2019s interim country partnership strategy, 2014\u20132016 for Mongolia, which \nprovides a renewed focus on preprimary and basic education.9 The TA is built on recently closed \nADB operations in Mongolia\u2019s education sector, including the Third Education Development Project \nand the Education Sector Reform Project, which supported the transition to the 12-year education \nsystem and the implementation of the education sector reform policy framework.10 This is the first \nTA focusing on issues that have emerged in the process of expanding the education system to 12 \nyears in Mongolia. Policy recommendations and an action plan to be developed under the TA will \nbe used to identify gaps in policy measures and physical investments to be supported under future \noperations. The TA is complementary to the Japan International Cooperation Agency\u2019s TA to the \nMECS in reviewing and improving the core curricula; the World Bank\u2019s Education Quality Reform \nProject, which supports improved teaching and assessments of the Mongolian language and math \nskills at the primary level; and Cambridge University\u2019s cooperation with the MECS in the Mongolia\u2013\nCambridge Education Initiative. \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact will be improved equity of access to quality education. The outcome will be \nenhanced management and implementation of education sector reforms with an emphasis on \nequity of access to quality education. Related policy recommendations and an action plan will be \nadopted by the MECS by the end of school year 2017\u20132018. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will have two outputs: (i) capacity to identify school factors that affect access to \nquality  educational  resources  and  learning  opportunities  developed,  and  (ii)  knowledge  and \nmeasures to enhance equity of access to quality education developed. \n \n11.  Output  1:  Capacity  to  identify  school  factors  that  affect  access  to  quality \neducational resources and learning opportunities developed. The TA will build capacity to \ncarry out municipal, aimag, and national level research on school factors that influence equity of \naccess to quality education. The following three areas will be researched: (i) organization of \nteaching\u2013learning  environment  within  schools,  including  school  facilities  and  materials  (e.g., \nheating systems, sanitation and dormitory facilities for boys and girls, libraries, gymnasiums, \nplaygrounds, furniture, information and communication technology and natural science equipment, \ntextbooks, and other teaching\u2013learning materials); teachers (e.g., qualifications, student\u2013teacher \nratio,  support  staff,  teacher  collaboration,  professional  learning);  school  leadership  (e.g., \ninstructional  leadership,  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  classrooms,  outreach  to  parents  and \n                                                \n9  ADB. 2014.

Disaggregated data on students \n(e.g., gender, language, family background, socioeconomic status, special needs, distance from \nhome to school, etc.) available through MECS\u2019s education management information system will be \nanalyzed to identify profiles of students disadvantaged in learning, together with research on the \nthree topics. \n \n12.  Research capacity will be built through collaboration between a consultant team engaged \nunder  the  TA,  the  Institute  of  Education,  the  reform  implementation  team,  and  education \ndepartments and laboratory schools in nine districts of Ulaanbaatar and six aimags (at least one \nfor each region, including Dundgovi aimag in central region, Khentii aimag in eastern region, \nKhuvsgol and Orkhon aimags in Khangai region, and Uvs and Zavkhan aimags in western region). \nResearch will cover the nine districts of Ulaanbaatar, where about 37% of students in the country \nstudy,  and  all  the  soums  (districts)  of  the  aimags  selected  based  on  student  learning \nachievements.  Research  framework  and  tools  will  be  developed  in  collaboration  with  the \nconsultant team, the Institute of Education, and the reform implementation team. Metropolitan and \naimag  education  departments  and  laboratory  schools  will  be  trained  in  the  use  of  research \nframework and tools, and research findings. Research findings and policy recommendations will \nbe presented and discussed at workshops organized in Ulaanbaatar and the research aimags, \nwith the participation of teachers; researchers, administrators, and policy makers at the municipal \naimag, and national levels; parents, civil society organizations; and mass media.  \n \n13.  Output 1 will be developed in three phases: (i) activities to be carried out in 6 months will \ninclude (a) research on the distribution of financial, human, and physical resources across schools \nusing data available through MECS\u2019s education management information system; (b) design of \nresearch framework and development of research tools; (c) training of education departments and \nlaboratory schools in the use of research framework and tools and research in nine districts of \nUlaanbaatar; and (d) organization of a workshop in Ulaanbaatar to present research findings; (ii) \nactivities to be implemented in 5 months will include (a) training of education departments and \nlaboratory schools; (b) research in Dundgovi, Khuvsgol, and Orkhon aimags; and (c) presentation \nand discussion of research findings at workshops organized in the aimags; (iii) activities to be \ncompleted in 5 months will include (a) training, research, and workshops in Khentii, Uvs, and \nZavkhan aimags; (b) a comparative analysis of research findings in Ulaanbaatar and the research \naimags; and (c) policy recommendations to enhance equity of access to quality education. \n \n14.  Output 2: Knowledge and measures to enhance equity of access to quality education \ndeveloped. The TA, in consultation with the MECS, the Institute of Education, and other relevant \nstakeholders, will support the preparation of policy notes and a costed action plan to enhance \nequity of access to quality education based on research findings and policy recommendations \ndeveloped  under  output  1.  The  policy  notes  and  costed  action  plan  will  be  presented  and \ndiscussed  at  workshops  with  teachers,  policy  makers  and  administrators,  researchers, \ndevelopment  partners, civil  society  organizations,  and  mass  media. Additionally,  output  2  will \ninclude knowledge products, such as publications and films that feature research findings and \npolicy recommendations. \n \n ", "  5 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,100,000, of which $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction. The government will provide counterpart support \nin the form of counterpart staff, policy documents and guidelines, statistical data, information, office \nspace, and other in-kind contributions. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The executing and implementing agency will be the MECS, which will be responsible for \ninvolving all relevant institutions during TA implementation, including the Institute of Education, the \nreform  implementation  team,  metropolitan  and  aimag  education  departments,  and  laboratory \nschools. A project steering committee, chaired by the director of the Strategic Policy and Planning \nDepartment of the MECS and comprising other MECS department directors and representatives \nfrom the Institute of Education, the reform management and implementation teams, Educational \nEvaluation  Center,  and  Teacher  Development  Institute,  will  be  established  to  review \nimplementation  progress  on  a  quarterly  basis.  Collaboration  with  the  Japan  International \nCooperation  Agency  and  Cambridge  University  will  be  sought  in  research  and  workshops,  if \nappropriate. The TA will be implemented from 31 July 2015 to 31 July 2017. \n \n17.  The TA will engage a consulting firm (international, 14 person-months; national, 34 person-\nmonths) to provide expertise in education economics, school management, education psychology, \nand didactics. The consulting firm will be selected using quality- and cost-based selection with a \nquality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10 and simplified technical proposals. Additionally, 5 person-months of \ninternational consulting services will be engaged on an individual basis to develop knowledge \nproducts.  The  engagement  of  individual  consultants  can  be  justified  because  the  main \nrequirements are individual experience and qualifications rather than collective responsibility. To \nreduce  administrative  burden  and  improve  economy,  efficiency,  and  value for  money,  all  the \nconsultants  will  be  engaged  on  output-based  (lump-sum)  contracts.  The  consultants  will  be \nengaged by ADB in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended \nfrom time to time). The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. The TA \nproceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook \n(2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n18.  The TA will be monitored and evaluated based on the implementation of activities and \nsatisfactory delivery of outputs following the agreed timeline and budget. To support monitoring \nand evaluation, the consultants will submit an inception report, a midterm report, a draft final report, \nand a final report to ADB and the MECS. The main mechanism to monitor and assess the TA will \nbe review missions jointly conducted by ADB and the MECS. Analyses and research findings, \npolicy notes and a costed action plan, and knowledge products will be presented and discussed at \nworkshops. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 to the Government \nof Mongolia to be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for Education \nSector Development, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpacts the project is aligned with: \n \nEquity of access to quality education improveda \n(MECS\u2019s education sector reform policy framework, 2012\u20132016)b \n \nPerformance Indicators with  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Reporting  Risks \nOutcome       \nManagement and  Policy recommendations and action  MECS\u2019s policy,  The country\u2019s \nimplementation of  plan to enhance equity of access to  strategy, and plan  macroeconomic situation \neducation sector reforms  quality education adopted by the  documents and orders  adversely affecting the \nwith an emphasis on  MECS by the end of school year  issued to aimag  availability of resources \nequity of access to  2017\u20132018  (province) education  for education sector \nquality education  departments and  reforms \nenhanced  schools \nOutputs  By end 2016     \n1.
