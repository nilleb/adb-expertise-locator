INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Nam Ngum River (NNR) in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) is one \nof the major tributaries of the Mekong. Several hydropower projects, including the Nam Ngum 3 \nHydropower  Project  (NN3),  are  either  planned  or  under  construction  on  the  NNR.  These \nprojects have been accorded the highest priority for development by the Government of the Lao \nPDR and are expected to start commercial operations within the next 5\u20136 years. The Project \nContact Consultation Mission fielded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in February 2006 \nconcluded that a cumulative impact assessment (CIA) study was necessary because of the \nsimultaneous  development  of  several  hydropower  projects  in  the  basin.  The  Fact-Finding \nMission fielded in June 2006 reconfirmed these findings, and met with the Government to \ndiscuss the possibility of providing project preparatory technical assistance (TA) to undertake a \nCIA study. ADB Management provided concept clearance for the proposed TA in June 2006. \nDuring the TA Preparation Mission fielded in September, following the formal funding request by \nthe  Government,1 the  Mission  held  discussions  with  ministries  and  stakeholders  on  the \nproposed  TA  and  reached  an  understanding with  the  Government  on  the  objectives,  cost \nestimates, implementation arrangements, and terms of reference for the TA as phase 1 of loan \nprocessing. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 The due diligence review \nof the project, which includes the review of project-specific environmental and social impacts will \nbe done separately as phase 2 of loan processing. \n  \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The  hydropower  potential  in  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion3 (GMS)  is  extensive, \nestimated at 30,000 megawatts (MW), but is unevenly distributed among the GMS countries. \nThe Lao PDR has the largest hydropower potential at 18,000 MW, but the smallest domestic \npower requirements. Under a program of cooperation,4 the GMS member countries have agreed \nto promote the development and trading of energy to enable member countries to have access \nto more economically viable energy resources. Since the Lao PDR is centrally located, it is well-\npositioned to harness its hydropower potential for export to GMS countries that have limited \nremaining hydropower resource and where demand for power is growing rapidly. The Lao PDR \ncurrently has commitments under bilateral power trading agreements to export up to 5,000 MW \nto Thailand5 and up to 3,000 MW to Viet Nam. \n  \n3.  Hydropower is the major source of electricity for the country and a vital source of export \nearnings.6  The Government has adopted a two-pronged power sector development strategy \nthat aims to (i) increase access to electricity for the country\u2019s largely rural population, and (ii) \nearn foreign exchange from the export of electricity. Thirty-three hydropower projects that are \nexpected to be completed by 2020 would increase the installed capacity by 8,935 MW.7  \n                                                 \n1  In a letter dated 21 August 2006, the Minister of Finance requested assistance to fund the country\u2019s equity in the \nproject while the sponsor signed a mandate with ADB on 6 March 2006 to obtain financial assistance for NN3. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 19 September 2006. \n3  The GMS countries are Cambodia, People\u2019s Republic of China, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam. \n4  In 1992, the GMS countries entered into a program of cooperation designed to enhance economic relations and \npromote development in the region. The program presently covers nine sectors: agriculture, energy, environment, \nhuman resource development, investment, telecommunication, tourism, trade, and transport. \n5  Thailand estimates that an additional 20 gigawatts (GW) of electricity is needed to support its growing economy. \nThe power sector strategy of Thailand, among others, calls for the diversification of its electricity supply sources \nand reduced reliance on imported gas for fuel. \n6  Export of hydropower began in 1971 with the commissioning of Nam Ngum 1. By 2004, the export of hydropower \naccounted for 30% of the total export receipts of the country. \n7  Source: Ministry of Energy and Mines, Department of Energy. \n ", "2   \n \n4.  The  Government  has  proposed  that  the  NNR  be  used  extensively  for  hydropower \ngeneration. Nam Ngum 1 (NN1) with an installed capacity of 150 MW, is already in operation \nwhile Nam Ngum 28 (NN2) with an installed capacity of 615 MW, is under construction. Other \nprojects under development include (i) NN39 with an installed capacity of 440 MW, (ii) Nam \nNgum 510 (NN5) with an installed capacity of about 100 MW\u2013120 MW, and (iii) Nam Ngum 4A11 \n(NN4) with an installed capacity of 60 MW. There are also other existing and planned projects in \ntributaries to the NNR downstream of NN1, of which several are river basin transfers.12 A \ncommercial mining operation13 is also located in the NNR basin (NNRB) upstream of NN2. \n \n5.  NN3 is one of the priority projects considered by the Government in relation to its \nhydropower  export  to  Thailand.14 NN3  will  be  built  4.5  kilometers  (km)  upstream  of  the \nconfluence of the Nam Pha river, approximately 55 km upstream of the NN1 reservoir and 16 \nkm upstream of the NN2 reservoir. A 220-meter (m)-high, rolled compacted concrete dam with a \ngated spillway will be built to create a 25.6 square kilometer (km2) reservoir, which will inundate \na 63 km section of NNR. NN3 will generate an average of 2,191 gigawatt hours (GWh) annually. \nConstruction is slated in 2008 and commissioning expected by 2013. \n \n6.  The Government has adopted a policy that requires that, for each hydropower project, \nenvironment and social impacts, including cumulative impacts, be identified and mitigated.15 \nPotential  adverse  impacts  to  the  environment  typically  include  degradation  of  biodiversity, \nfishery and aquatic habitats, and water quality. Potential social impacts would normally include \n(i) involuntary resettlement; (ii) impact on indigenous peoples; (iii) disruption of lifestyle and \ntraditions; (iv) loss of income; (v) trafficking of women and children; and (vi) possible emergence \nof infections and illnesses, including those that are transmitted sexually (e.g., HIV/AIDS).    \n  \n7.  The NN1 reservoir supports a thriving fishing industry that currently yields about 1,500 \ntons  of  fish  per  year,  equivalent  to  $3.0  million  annually.  The  fishing  industry  provides \nsubsistence livelihood to the villages around the NN1 reservoir and immediately upstream. The \nshort-term sustainability of this industry is uncertain with the construction of both NN2 and NN3. \nThe combined impacts of poor water quality discharges from NN2 and NN3 may lead to a \nsubstantial reduction of fish catches at the NN1 reservoir that would impact commercial fishing \nin the NN1 reservoir. NN2 impoundment could require the resettlement of about 6,000 people \nfrom 16 villages, while NN3 will impact about 71 households consisting of approximately 500 \nindividuals from Ban Xiengdet village at the upstream end of its reservoir. These impacts and \n                                                 \n8  NN2 will be developed by a consortium led by SouthEast Asia Energy Limited. Other major shareholders include \nRatchaburi Electricity Generating Public Company (Ratchaburi), Bangkok Expressway Public Company and the \nGovernment of the Lao PDR. NN2 is expected to be commissioned by 2011. \n9  NN3  is  being  developed  by  a  consortium  consisting  of  GMS  Power  Public  Company  Limited,  Marubeni \nCorporation, and Ratchaburi. The Government of the Lao PDR will have a 23% equity stake in NN3. \n10  This project will be developed by Sino-Hydro Corporation of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). Construction on \nNN5 will begin in 2007 with commercial operations expected by 2009\u20132010. \n11 A sponsor has yet to be awarded the right to develop this project. \n12 Existing: Nam Song River Diversion (same-basin transfer from Nam Song to NN1), Nam Leuk hydropower plant \n(basin transfer from Nam Leuk River basin to NN1), Nam Mang 3 hydropower plant (basin transfer from Nam \nGnong to lower NNR); planned: Nam Lik \u00bd on Nam Lik, tributary to lower NNR. \n13 Phu Bia Mine is a commercial open pit mining operation owned by Pan Australian Resources. Mining operations \nbegan in 2005 while construction for an expansion of  copper-gold operations started in 2006. \n14 NN2 and NN3 have export earnings potential as their size is suitable to meet the Thai market requirements. NN4A \nand NN5 would be more appropriate for the domestic market, given their sizes.  \n15 Science  Technology  and  Environment  Agency.  2005.

Vientiane (7 June 2005). \n ", "  3\nother  cumulative  impacts  have  to  be  identified,  and  mitigated  or  avoided  to  ensure  the \nsustainability of the planned hydropower projects along the NNR. \n  \n8.  The  Government  has  started  to  adopt  an  integrated  approach  to  river  basin \nmanagement  to  avoid  resource-use  conflicts  and  achieve  sustainable  development.  ADB \nprovided a TA to the Government to introduce this approach, with specific application to NNR.16 \nADB approved a loan in 2002 to help the Government implement river basin management in the \nNNR.17 The proceeds of the loan and the grant from Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement \n(AFD) would (i) finance activities to strengthen the capacity of government agencies at the \nprovincial and central levels, (ii) develop a river basin model, and (iii) increase coordination \namong the various agencies through the Water Resources Coordination Committee (WRCC). \nThese initiatives are still in the early stages and are expected to be completed by 2009. \nPrograms or technical assistance, such as the proposed TA, to finance specific components of \nriver basin management, would complement the existing programs from ADB and AFD. \n \n9.  Lessons from ADB-funded hydropower projects in the Lao PDR indicate that, while the \nGovernment has made steady progress in river basin planning and project implementation, it \nstill needs to strengthen both its financial and technical capacities to implement large-scale \ncomplex hydropower projects. An ADB TA report18 in 1999 observed that, in general, few \nenvironmental  and  social  impact  assessment  studies  had  been  prepared  for  most  of  the \nhydropower projects that the Government considered for development. Funding agencies and \nmultilateral institutions, including ADB, have extended technical assistance to finance impact \nassessment studies, including CIAs and mitigation plans, to ensure that adequate planning was \nundertaken for a specific hydropower project.19 Given that several hydropower and mining \nprojects are simultaneously being developed close to each other in the NNRB by different \nsponsors that may find it difficult to share proprietary information, it would be beneficial for the \nGovernment to undertake one cumulative impact study to cover all these projects. Moreover, \nwhile  the  technical  capacity  of  government  agencies  has  improved  from  various  capacity-\nbuilding activities, the Government would benefit from further assistance since there are not \nenough technically trained staff to undertake a CIA study, given the large number of hydropower \nprojects that are currently in various stages of development and operation. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The TA will undertake the first phase of the preparatory work for the project. The main \nimpacts of the TA will be (i) to provide an input to the sustainable development of the project, \nand (ii) to facilitate the implementation of an integrated NNRB management. The outcome of the \nTA will be the identification of cumulative environmental and social impacts caused by multiple \nhydropower developments in the NNRB so that mitigating measures to address such impacts \nare designed appropriately. \n                                                 \n16 ADB. 2000.

Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  The TA will consist of two related components:, (i) component A \u2013 preparation of a CIA, \nmitigation  framework,  and  monitoring  program;  and  (ii)  component  B  \u2013  strengthening  of \ninstitutional  linkages  for  integrated  river  basin  management  to  ensure  that  the  project  is \nprepared in accordance with integrated water resource management (IWRM) principles and \nADB\u2019s water policy.20 Component A will consist of two parts. Part 1 will identify cumulative \nimpacts caused by hydropower and other development activities over the medium to long term, \nand part 2 will  monitor the impacts identified in part 1. \n \n12.  The CIA study will (i) assess, using the river basin model jointly financed by ADB and \nAFD (scheduled to be ready by March 2007), the impacts of the planned development in the \nNNRB and specifically NN3 impacts, including downstream impacts on the NN1 reservoir and \ndownstream to the confluence with the Mekong; and (ii) develop scenarios covering hydrology, \nvulnerability to flooding, social issues (i.e., resettlement, impact on indigenous people, gender, \npoverty, and health risks), fisheries, water quality, water supply, irrigation, biodiversity, and \ninstitutional issues. The assessment will (i) identify potential sector impacts, (ii) predict major \ncumulative environmental impacts, (iii) indicate threshold levels of sustainable development, \nand (iv) set environmental and social parameter standards and targets. The NN3 sponsors will \nthen  update  the  (i)  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  to  include  cumulative  and \ndownstream impacts, and (ii) the environmental and social mitigation plans and compensation \nmeasures to ensure that the impacts of the project identified by the CIA study are mitigated and \nsatisfactorily addressed. The impacts of the other projects in the NNRB will be given to the \nGovernment for their consideration and discussion with specific project sponsors. The CIA will \nbuild on previous NNRB studies and an ongoing loan (footnotes 16\u201318). \n  \n13.  The  main  CIA  tasks  are  to  (i)  identify  the  main  environmental  and  social  issues \n(including poverty and gender analysis) as a result of the construction of the dam and ancillary \nfacilities,21 (ii)  establish  and  convene  an  interministerial  working  group  (IWG),  (iii)  further \ndevelop a profile of the basin, (iv) review current basin planning and management, (v) identify \nbasin  development  scenarios,  (vi)  predict  cumulative  impacts,  and  (vii)  design  a  basin \nmonitoring program. The monitoring program will be implemented under the TA over a 2-year \nperiod,  in  cooperation  with  the  appropriate  government  agency.  Under  component  B,  the \ninstitutional and policy regime for IWRM will be reviewed at both national and basin levels in the \ncontext  of  ongoing  aid  agency-funded  activities  including  the  Nam  Ngum  Watershed \nManagement  Project.    Specific  actions  will  then  be  proposed  for  consideration  by  the \nGovernment and funding agencies. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at about $1,158,000, of which ADB will provide \n$983,000. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the \nGovernment of Japan. The Government of the Lao PDR will finance $175,000 in kind by \nproviding  office  accommodation,  counterpart  staff,  and  related  facilities  (Appendix  3).  The \nGovernment has been informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any \nensuing project. \n \n                                                 \n20 ADB. 2001. Water for All.

ADB\u2019s Southeast Asia \nDepartment will lead the due diligence on the environmental and social aspects, while ADB\u2019s \nPrivate Sector Operations Department will lead the commercial due diligence. \n \n16.  The  TA  will  engage  and  finance  54  person-months  of  consulting  services  (27 \ninternational and 27 national). A consulting team will be engaged to conduct Component A. The \nquality-cost based selection method and full technical proposals will be used in recruiting the \nconsulting  firm.  International  individual  consultants  will  be  recruited  for  component  B  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2006, as amended from time to \ntime) and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB. \n \n17.  The  Department  of  Electricity  of  the  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Mines  will  be  the  TA \nExecuting Agency (EA). The director general22 will lead the EA\u2019s counterpart team. An IWG, \nchaired by the head of the EA, will be established with representatives from each relevant \nnational ministry and Government departments, including provincial government representatives \nand the consulting firm.23 The objective of IWG will be to (i) share information on basin features \nand  developments,  (ii)  raise  awareness  about  basin  and  social  issues,  (iii)  establish  links \nbetween  different  stakeholders,  and  (iv)  identify  opportunities  for  cooperation  between \nstakeholders to achieve sustainable resource use. Regular meetings will help ensure that the \nCIA and capacity-building initiatives take into account multiple project management objectives, \npolicies,  and  existing  initiatives  in  the  basin,  and  that  major  stakeholders  develop  an \nappreciation of the diverse uses and related impacts of the various activities in the basin. The \nIWG will also ensure that there is proper coordination between the TA and the Nam Ngum River \nBasin  Development  Project  (NRBDP)  financed  by  ADB  and  AFD  (footnote  17),  to  avoid \nduplication  of  efforts  or  initiatives  such  as  data  collection,  modeling,  or  capacity-building \nprograms.24 The  IWG  chairperson\u2019s  primary  responsibility  will  be  to  facilitate  TA  activities, \nprovide inputs, and review the outputs.  \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented from May 2007 to November 2009. An inception report will \nbe submitted to ADB and the Government by the end of June 2007. The report will include a \nwork plan that will be discussed with ADB and the Government. An interim report summarizing \nthe TA activities related to component A, part 1, will be submitted 3 months after the TA starts.  \nThe final CIA report will be submitted 3 months later. Component A, part 2, will start immediately \nthereafter and will run for 24 months. A TA final report will be submitted at the end of component \nA, part 2.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic: \n \nThe Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) is among the poorest countries in the Asian region with a per capita \ngross domestic product of only $490 in 2005. The country, however, has achieved considerable progress since 1990 \nin reducing poverty, with the incidence of poverty falling from 46% to 32% of the population from 1992 to 2003. The \ncountry\u2019s prospects for growth have improved over time as a result of several market reforms adopted by the \nGovernment. Key sectors such as hydropower, mining, and tourism will continue to fuel the country\u2019s growth in the \nmedium term and contribute to the objective of the Lao PDR exiting from least-developed nation status by 2020. \n \nSince the Lao PDR is a landlocked country and has no natural ports, its capacity to effectively participate in \ninternational trade is inhibited. It is, however, endowed with abundant natural resources, which it could export to its \nneighboring countries to generate much-needed foreign currency revenues. Water is the most abundant natural \nresource in the Lao PDR and is used extensively for hydropower generation. Hydropower represents one of the \ncountry\u2019s most important sources of foreign currency revenues, with electricity exports contributing close to 30% of the \ncountry\u2019s total export earnings in 2004. The probability of increasing electricity exports is significant since the country \nhas harnessed only less than 5% of its hydropower potential while the demand for electricity in neighboring countries \ncontinues to rise. Revenues from hydropower projects can be used to improve basic government services, including \neducation, health, and infrastructure primarily in poor areas of the country. \n \nThe Nam Ngum 3 hydropower (NN3) project will contribute to the sustainable growth of the economy by increasing \nannual export receipts.  Moreover, job opportunities for Laotian nationals will be created either directly or indirectly, \nthus reducing  poverty.  The analysis should assess the number of local employment created as a result of the project; \nand assess the quality of these job opportunities and compare them with the job opportunities in the country without \nthe NN3 project. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention (geographic intervention) \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nThe NN3 project is expected to contribute to the Lao PDR\u2019s economic growth and development primarily through the \nexport of hydropower to Thailand. Significant revenues will accrue to the Government in the form of royalties, taxes, \nand dividends over the 25-year operational period defined in the concession agreement. Such revenues could be \napplied to support the Government\u2019s poverty reduction programs.  \n \nUnder the technical assistance (TA), the poverty impact analysis (PIA) will examine the various poverty reduction \nprograms of the Government and sources of revenues, and determine the best application of the project revenues to \nthe Government\u2019s poverty reduction program, specifically for the communities living by the Nam Ngum River in \nVientiane province.   \n \nThe PIA will be undertaken in the project area, which includes project lands, and upstream and downstream \ncommunities.  It will use both quantitative and qualitative methodologies to obtain data on household characteristics \nand source of income; assets; access to goods and services; prices; employment; provincial poverty line in the project \narea; various dimensions of poverty; seasonal poverty; comparison of poverty between social and/or ethnic groups; \ninequality; vulnerability; and their determinates.  The analysis will include immediate and cumulative impact of the \nhydropower project on poverty in the project area and on various social/ethnic groups, women, women heads of \nhouseholds, the elderly, and children.  The PIA will lead to a poverty reduction strategy for the project area (project \nland, upstream and downstream) communities. \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  11 \n \nC.

The  implementation  of  the  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  require  the  services  of  a \nmultidisciplinary team of international consultants engaged as individuals and through a consulting \nfirm. The TA will consist of two components. Component A consisting of two parts will require \nabout 21 person-months of international consulting services from the consulting firm and about 27 \nperson-months from national consultants. Component B will require about 6 person-months of \nindividual international consultants with expertise in the environment and river basin management.  \n \nA.  Component A, Part 1:  Cumulative Impact Assessment \n \n2.  The cumulative impact assessment (CIA) study has the dual objective of (i) providing input \nto the environmental impact assessment (EIA) for the Nam Ngum 3 (NN3) hydropower project to \nbe prepared by the sponsor, and (ii) providing a core planning tool for the integrated management \nof the Nam Ngum river basin (NNRB) by the Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic \n(Lao PDR). The CIA will assess the construction and operation impacts of NN3 on key basin \nvalues, as well as the effects of all other development and activity in the basin that are likely to \nimpact on the same key basin values affected by NN3.  \n  \n3.  Key  cumulative  basin  impact  issues  associated  with  NN3  will  be  identified  The  main \nimpacts of major existing or proposed developments (not limited to hydropower alone) in the basin \nwill be identified from (i) environmental monitoring data and studies, (ii) EIAs and environment \nmanagement  plans,  (iii)  incident  reports,  (iv)  basin  management  plans,  (v)  discussions  with \nGovernment agencies, (vi) project owners and affected people, and (vii) other information sources.  \n \n4.  The  initial  scope  of  the  study  will  include  (i)  spatial  and  temporal  considerations,  (ii) \npotential development scenarios, and (iii) key issues and questions. The study will cover a range of \ngrowth possibility and address the key issues and cumulative impacts likely to be faced in these \nscenarios. The consultant will refine this scope if required as the CIA progresses. \n \n(i)  Spatial coverage. The CIA will assess impacts within the entire NNRB down to the \nMekong confluence. External influences that create significant direct impacts in the \nbasin will be accounted for in the assessment (e.g., interbasin water transfer), while \nany external areas identified as having a significant impact on basin values will also \nbe addressed. The basin was selected as the boundary for the CIA as it covers the \ninfluences on Nam Ngum river hydrology, the main basin value that will be affected \nby NN3. \n(ii)  Temporal coverage. The CIA will evaluate recent trends and the existing condition \nof the basin, as well as potential impacts for a 6-year planning horizon (2008\u20132013) \nand  a  20-year  horizon  (2007\u20132027).  The  6-year  horizon  includes  the  start  of \noperation of NN3, due in 2013, while the 20-year horizon matches the long-term \ntime frame commonly used in planning studies undertaken at the regional, national, \nand/or sectoral levels by the Mekong River Commission  and the Government. The \nconsultant  will  also  provide,  when  possible,  quantitative  longer-term  projections \nbased on anticipated trends. \n(iii)  Development scenarios. The consultant will examine the cumulative impacts of \nNN3 in two development scenarios: (a) the \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d development pattern, \nbased on the aggregate of all proposed developments including NN3; and (b) the \n\u201cwithout NN3\u201d scenario.

The CIA will assess the cumulative impacts of NN3 \nand  development  scenarios,  covering  hydrology,  vulnerability  to  flooding,  social \nissues (i.e., involuntary resettlement, loss of income, ethnic minorities, and health \nrisks including risk of HIV/AIDS), fisheries, water quality, transport, water supply and \nirrigation, urban development, institutional issues, and biodiversity. \n(v)  Conclusions of the study. The findings of the CIA study will serve as a guide for \nthe preparation of medium- and long-term plans by (a) institutions in the project\u2019s \nimmediate  area  of  influence,  (b)  provincial  departments,  and  (c)  the  national \nGovernment. Major outputs of the study will include (a) a comprehensive list of the \ncumulative impacts of proposed hydropower development in the NNRB, specifically \nthe contribution of NN3; (b) an updated detailed environmental and social mitigation \nplan that would be prepared by the sponsors and would address cumulative and \ndownstream impacts; and (c) recommendations for stakeholders to better address \nthe identified impacts and improve their planning and programs. \n \n5.

Component A, Part 2: Monitoring Program Implementation  \n \n7.        A  basin  monitoring  program  will  be  designed  and  agreed  on  under  part  1  for  key \nenvironmental value indicators. At a minimum, it will monitor river flows, water quality, and fish \nspecies at selected sites. The program will take into account (i) the location of existing and likely \ndevelopments, (ii) the type of impacts and risks that different developments pose, and (iii) the \nmonitoring requirements imposed on different sector developments. The monitoring program will \n(i) be implemented in coordination with the monitoring programs of the various sponsors, and \n(ii) incorporate current Government programs and institutional arrangements, as appropriate, to \nstandardize  methods  and  avoid  repetition.  The  program  will  be  implemented  by  Government \nrepresentatives with assistance from the consultants during the initial 2 years.

The capacity of Government \nagencies to manage a sustainable basin development program in the NNRB will be assessed, \ntaking into account the ongoing aid agency-funded projects and programs.  Gaps, contradictions, \nlack of coordination, and weaknesses in policy, funding agency assistance, and implementation will \nbe identified. This will include the effectiveness of the management and monitoring of individual \nprojects in accordance with IWRM principles. On the basis of the review, a strategy and a set of \ninitiatives will be proposed for consideration by the Government and other funding agencies active \nin the river basin. The individual consultant under component B will also comment on the CIA \nrecommendations from an IWRM perspective and make project-specific recommendations for the \ndesign of the NN3 Project to ensure that it is prepared in accordance with IWRM principles and \nrelevant  ADB  sector  policies.
