THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on two proposed loans \nto the Republic of Kazakhstan for the COVID-19 Active Response and Expenditure Support \nProgram  (the  Program),  under  the  Countercyclical  Support  Facility\u2013COVID-19  pandemic \nresponse option (CPRO).1 \n2.  The economy of Kazakhstan in 2020 is expected to contract between 0.9% and 2.4% in \nreal terms. Economic growth was strong in early 2020 in Kazakhstan\u2014above 4%\u2014and the \nprevious outlook for 2020\u20132022 of average 4% growth and continuous fiscal consolidation was in \nline with the good performance of recent years. But the recessionary effects of the coronavirus \ndisease  (COVID-19)  pandemic  have  significantly  worsened  Kazakhstan\u2019s  macroeconomic \nsituation. The country\u2019s non-oil fiscal deficit as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) for \n2020 is now set to widen to 11% (from 8% in 2019, and an originally expected 7% for 2020), \ninterrupting its recent downward trajectory (it was 10% in 2017).  \n3.  Early health and epidemic-control responses. The pre-COVID-19 efforts initiated in \nearly January to build health system response capacity helped cope with current hospitalization \nneeds. Strict social lockdown measures were implemented since March 15 when the first COVID-\n19 cases in the country were confirmed. But the medical emergency remains dangerous.   \n4.  Economic  and  social  costs  of  COVID-19  response.  The  strict  social  lock-down \nmeasures  introduced  in  March  to  slow  down  the  spread  of  the  virus  imposed  significant \nrestrictions on Kazakhstan's non-oil economy and seriously hurt the country's macroeconomic \noutlook. Several enterprise surveys undertaken in early April indicated that (i) by the end of March, \n48% of employees had been put on leave without pay and 13% had been terminated; and (ii) for \nthe second quarter of 2020, an estimated 40% of employees could be put on leave without pay \nand 12% could be terminated. Tourism, hospitality, education, food services, retail trade, and \nmanufacturing were among the areas hit hardest. Women can be most affected by these \neconomic restrictions\u2014they account for more than 65% of the labor force in hospitality, education, \nand wholesale and retail trade; own/manage most of the microenterprises; and are a large share \nof the informal labor market. Estimates are of a loss of 1% of GDP per week of social lockdown.    \n5.  The pandemic-caused global recession hits Kazakhstan. The economic and social \ndifficulties that Kazakhstan began experiencing in March are now being compounded by the \neffects of (i) a new oil price shock (and the collapse in the prices of other commodities), and (ii) \nthe sudden stop of financial flows into emerging markets (EMs). These direct consequences of \nthe global pandemic halved the prices of 80% of Kazakhstan\u2019s exports. Exchange rate pressures \nwere eased by allowing a 20% depreciation of the tenge and by raising the policy rate, which \nincreased the debt-servicing costs across the economy. Pressures on the asset quality of banks \nare already constraining the provision of new liquidity to microenterprises and small and medium-\nsized enterprises (SMEs). This added to the ongoing disruptions of the social lock-down. Without \na fiscal response, the economy could contract by 5.5%. The poor and vulnerable, including \nwomen, can be disproportionately affected. Poverty rates may reach 11%\u201313% (from 6.6% now). \n6.  Robust  and  comprehensive  government  response.  To  counter  this  sequence  of \nshocks, the government adopted comprehensive medical, public health, and fiscal stimulus \nmeasures totaling T5.9 trillion (8%\u20139% of GDP, or about $13 billion). The government will self-\nfund more than 81% of this, including with transfers of $4.7 billion\u2013$5 billion from the National \n \n1   Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2020. Policy Paper: ADB\u2019s Comprehensive Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic. \nManila. ", "2   \nFund of the Republic of Kazakhstan (NFRK). $2 billion of net new borrowing will be required (see \ndetails in para. 25). The sound pre-shock macroeconomic management record of the government \nis being instrumental in projecting credibility to recent monetary and macroprudential policy \ndecisions in banking and exchange-rate markets. The proposed assistance from the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) will help the government mitigate the medical, social and economic \nimpacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on Kazakhstan, by supporting its (i) immediate COVID-19 \nhealth policy response, (ii) social protection and employment protection measures, and (iii) overall \nstimulus measures.2 Kazakhstan\u2019s CPRO eligibility is summarized in Table 1 and detailed in \nAppendix 4. The Program is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 in helping Kazakhstan address \nremaining  poverty  and  inequality  risks,  accelerate  progress  in  gender  equality,  strengthen \ngovernance and institutional capacity, and foster regional cooperation and integration (para. 23).3 \nTable 1: Summary of Assessment of Compliance with Access Criteria for CPRO \nCriteria  ADB staff assessment \n1. Adverse  Health costs are rising with the COVID-19 epidemic. Significant economic and fiscal costs of the \nImpact of  social lockdown measures have been produced by ongoing disruptions in business turnover and \nExogenous  employment. The second pandemic-related shock was dealt by the significant oil price slump. \nShocks  Exchange rate pressures have also led to a hike in financial costs across the economy. Taking \ninto account the current government anti-crisis response, the depth of the economic \nrecession in 2020 is now expected to be between 0.9% and 2.4%. \n2.  A countercyclical response package (including both tax and expenditure plans and quasi-fiscal \nCountercyclical  measures to ensure social and employment protection, and to relaunch the economic recovery) \nDevelopment  was approved in March\u2013April, 2020. It is comprehensive, and sizable. It implies a stimulus of \nExpenditures  8%\u20139% of GDP in 2020 (about $13 billion). Fiscal measures to mitigate disruptions to business \nand employment are targeted and gender-inclusive (including transfers to the vulnerable \npopulation and the potentially most affected segments of the labor market, such as women).  \n3. Pre-shock  Kazakhstan\u2019s new monetary regime has served its macroeconomy well, with stable inflation \nRecord of  (within 4%\u20136% of the target) and added exchange rate flexibility. The NBK improved its systemic \nSound  liquidity management and interest rate transmission mechanism. Kazakhstan\u2019s fiscal \nMacroeconomic  management has been credible, with non-oil fiscal deficits on a downward trajectory and with \nManagement  sustainable levels of public debt. Kazakhstan\u2019s PFM systems are reliable and well tested. As \nobserved by different institutions (e.g., IMF Assessment Letter), macroeconomic management \nprior to the shock was sound, and growth performance was strong (4% on average). \n4. Structural  The authorities: (i) initiated COVID-19 readiness preparations in early-January, i.e. more than 2-\nReforms  months before the first COVID case in Kazakhstan, and immediately built-up the capacity of the \n(Health Sector  health-care system to cope with worst-case hospitalization scenarios; and (ii) announced a 30-\nResponse to  day state of emergency from 16 March onwards (first cases reported on 13 March), and \nCovid-19  extended to mid-May; with a series of other strict quarantine and social lockdown measures. \nEpidemic)  Comprehensive health response measures are being fully implemented and are perceived \nto have been effective so far at dealing with the medical emergency. \n5. Debt  Kazakhstan\u2019s public sector debt remains sustainable (30% of GDP by 2025, versus the \nSustainability  projected 20% pre-COVID) and its net creditor status is now expected to only last until \n2024. Large tapping of the NFRK to finance the crisis response ($10.9 billion in total in 2020) is \nexpected to bring its assets from 34.5% of GDP in 2019 to 30% GDP by 2024, furthering its \nrecent downward trajectory. Borrowing from ADB (e.g. through the proposed CPRO) and other \nconcessional sources will have a negligible but beneficial impact on debt-to-GDP ratio, and \nshould be a priority at this stage in view of lower levels of gross debt. See Debt Sustainability \nAnalysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n6. Coordination   ADB keeps consulting with the IMF and discusses forecasts and emerging risks. ADB and the \nwith the IMF  IMF agree on the appropriateness of the government\u2019s anti-crisis response plans. The IMF \nupdated its debt sustainability analysis for the government and ADB, and provided an \nassessment letter to ADB that describes ongoing consultations with the government. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, COVID-19 = coronavirus disease, CPRO = COVID-19 pandemic response option, \nGDP = gross domestic product, IMF = International Monetary Fund, NBK = National Bank of Kazakhstan, NFRK = \nNational Fund of the Republic of Kazakhstan, PFM = public financial management.  \nSource: ADB. \n \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n3  ADB. 2018.

First pandemic-related shock. As of 2 June 2020, 11,796 COVID-19 cases have been \nconfirmed in Kazakhstan (the first cases were recorded on 13 March) and 44 related deaths were \nregistered. The epidemiological situation remains dangerous. The national health system was \nrapidly upgraded to cope with the epidemic, thanks to the measures initiated in early January \n2020, i.e., before the epidemic had arrived in the country. This has been recognized to have been \neffective so far at coping with hospitalization challenges.4 But strict social lockdown measures \nintroduced to slow the spread of the virus imposed very significant restrictions on businesses and \nemployment and brought a recessionary outlook to Kazakhstan. Microenterprises and SMEs were \nimpacted in particular\u2014their turnover fell by 75%.5 The activities hardest hit directly are tourism, \nhospitality,  education, food services, and manufacturing. Restrictions on economic activity can \nparticularly affect women.6 The health emergency remains a serious challenge and its fiscal costs \nare sizable. OECD estimates point to a loss of 1% of GDP per week of social lockdown.7 \nFigure 1: Pandemic-Related Global Recessionary Shocks to Markets \nDow Jones (right-hand-side axis; index points) I Crude Oil (left-hand-side axis; USD/Bbl)\n \n                  Source: Trading Economics. https://tradingeconomics.com/.   \n8.  Second pandemic-related shock. While the COVID-19 pandemic rapidly overwhelmed \nhealth systems and shut down large segments of economies across the world, from the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) to Europe to the United States, it is becoming particularly damaging in \ndeveloping and emerging economies that are highly dependent on commodity exports or tourism \nrevenues. Kazakhstan's experience is of particular significance. The collapse of the international \nprices of oil and other commodities (which determine more than 80% of Kazakhstan\u2019s export \nrevenue) is sustained by the global recessionary outlook for 2020 (Figure 1).8 Also, a sudden stop \nin capital flows hit EMs. The cumulative outflows from these markets since the onset of the \nCOVID-19 crisis are extraordinary in magnitude, even by the standards of the global financial \ncrisis.9 This will directly affect banks in Kazakhstan with foreign-currency refinancing needs, and \nall firms, individuals and projects in Kazakhstan with debt denominated in foreign currency. \n \n4  https://twitter.com/hans_kluge/status/1260277518327844866.  \n5  Several enterprise surveys undertaken in early April indicated that (i) by 23 March, 48% of employees had been put \non leave without pay and 13% had been terminated; and (ii) for the second quarter, an estimated 40% of employees \nwould be put on leave without pay and 12% would be terminated. \n6  Women account for more than 65% of the labor force in some of the most affected sectors (e.g., hospitality, education, \nand wholesale-retail trade); own or manage 42% of SMEs; and represent a large share of the informal labor market. \n7  OECD. 2020. Tackling Coronavirus (COVID-19), Contributing to a Global Effort: The COVID-19 Crisis in Kazakhstan. \n8  The sustained drop in global demand continues to weigh on investors' sentiment in world commodity markets. Global \ndemand for oil may fall as much as 30% in 2020. Outstanding surpluses also threaten to overwhelm storage capacity \nin many oil-producing countries such as Kazakhstan, and halt production and investments in their oil industries. \n9  Institute of International Finance: https://www.iif.com/Publications/ID/3829; https://www.iif.com/Publications/ID/3840.  \n ", "4   \n9.  Without a fiscal response, the economy could contract in real terms by 5.5% in 2020 \n(instead of the 4% average growth that had been projected for 2020).10 The collapse in export \nrevenues brought about exchange rate pressures that the monetary authorities allowed to take \nhold while raising the policy rate to 12% (from 9.25%) to smooth the currency depreciation \nprocess. As a consequence, debt-servicing costs in the economy have risen for both local \ncurrency credit and foreign currency credit contracts, even if the policy rate was subsequently \nlowered to 9.75% in the face of weakening aggregate demand. This is now affecting the asset \nquality of banks, and will further constrain access to finance for microenterprises and SMEs.  \n \nFigure 2: Macroeconomic Pressures on Kazakhstan \n \nGDP Growth Scenarios (in percentage)\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n-1\n-2\n-3\n-4\n-5\n-6\n-7\n-8 EIU Forecast as of 10 February 2020\nEIU Forecast as of 16 March 2020\n \nScenario Without Fiscal Response (Forecast as of 10/04/2020)\n \nEIU = Economist Intelligence Unit, GDP = gross domestic product, Q = quarter. \nSources: Asian Development Bank; EIU. https://www.eiu.com/n/; Trading Economics. https://tradingeconomics.com/. \n \n10.  Social vulnerabilities, poverty, and gender risks. Unless countered, the shocks that hit \nKazakhstan can exacerbate levels of poverty and social vulnerability. Gender risks are also \nrecognizable. These dimensions and risks can be disaggregated by each of the three shocks: \n(i)  The COVID-19 crisis could increase hospitalization and medication costs to a level \nthat would overwhelm the budgets of the poor and most vulnerable, if infected. It \nalso puts health workers, of whom 70% are women, at risk.  \n(ii)  The strict social lockdown measures of the government are crucial in containing \nthe medical emergency. But these measures pose significant risks to livelihoods \nand income generation in business activities where women's participation is high. \nWomen account for more than 65% of the labor force in some of the sectors most \naffected by the current lockdowns. Some hard-hit informal activities include a large \nshare of women.  \n(iii)  Without a well-targeted fiscal response to the current recessionary pressures, \npoverty rates could reach 11%\u201313%.11 Women could also be disproportionally \naffected by a deep recession, given existing gender disparities in wage levels (in \n2015,  women  workers  earned  only  65.9%  of  men\u2019s  average  wages)  and \nunemployment rates (the  unemployment rate  for  women  was  5.7%  in  2015, \ncompared with 4.3% for men), and already disadvantaged access to finance in \nnormal times (businesses with female managers face a 77% rejection rate on \naverage, compared with 17% for businesses with male managers).12 \n \n10 ADB staff and IMF staff projections. \n11 The poverty rate was 6.6% in 2019. Differentials between men (2.6%) and women (2.7%) are not significant. \n12 Women also face higher collateral requirements (loan\u2013value ratio of 260%) than men (170%). \n ", "5 \n11.  Fiscal challenges. The health budget is expected to swell, as are other expenditure \nitems. The revised state budget indicates a 10.5% increase in overall expenditure.13 Tax revenue \nrelated to the extractive industries is expected to plummet in 2020, and other tax revenue will also \nbe affected by ongoing business and employment distress. The total reduction in tax revenues in \n2020 is estimated at 20%.14 Originally-allocated transfers from the NFRK to the state budget of \n$6.2 billion will receive an additional and sizable top-up, bringing it to an estimated total of $10.9 \nbillion in 2020 (total transfers in 2018 were $7.6 billion). This depletion of NFRK will be further \ncompounded by lower inflows due to sharp drops in oil revenues and a marked reduction in the \nmarket value of its financial assets. This is significant in view of the NFRK\u2019s crucial role in \nintergenerational equity and the risks to this mandate (see discussion in para. 27).15 Kazakhstan\u2019s \ndomestic securities market is still nascent (see para. 26), and the government\u2019s access to \ninternational capital markets is now very limited, as indicated by the rise in the risk spreads of \nregional sovereign Eurobonds (figures 3\u20134; Kazakhstan is in the lowest rank of investment grade). \n \nFigure 3: Eurobonds Sovereign CIS  Figure 4:  Eurobonds NIG Sovereign CIS \n(Spread with US Treasuries)  (Spread with US Treasuries) \n   \nCSI = Commonwealth of Independent States, NIG = non-investment grade, US = United States. \nSource: Cbonds Financial Information. Index group: Euro-Cbonds Sovereign CIS.  \n \n12.  A recession in the Kazakhstan's economy (which represents 50% of Central Asia\u2019s \nGDP) has a substantial regional impact through sharp drops in trade and remittance flows. \nADB established the CPRO to support its developing member countries in countering the severe \nhealth, fiscal and macroeconomic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic currently spreading across \nborders. This was also meant to generate a regional public good and promote an internationally \ncoordinated effort to lower the transmission of infections and mitigate negative cross-border social \nand economic spillovers. The number of nationals from the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, and \nUzbekistan that work in Kazakhstan and send home remittances has increased substantially in \nrecent years. More than three and a half million migrants of all categories live in Kazakhstan.16 \nEven though a substantial share of remittance outflows takes place through informal means, \nformal money-transfers recorded by the NBK for April 2020 already showed a decrease of 13% \nversus April 2019. Kazakhstan is a significant importer of food and other products from the Kyrgyz \nRepublic and other Central Asian countries. It is a major wheat exporter to regional countries, and \n \n13 On the expenditure side, the government also had to optimize spending according to evolving priorities, including a \nbudget reallocation of T533 billion, cancellation of some international and local events, and deferment of some capital \nexpenditures. There is also a risk of a further increase in outlays for the import of capital goods. \n14 The state budget for the fiscal year 2020 was approved in September 2019 on the premise of global oil prices in the \nrange of $55 per barrel. After Kazakhstan declared a state of emergency, the new base-case scenario assumes an \noil price of $20 per barrel. In 2019, the 30 largest oil and gas companies in Kazakhstan paid almost 50% of all taxes \nto the budget, or T4.6 trillion. While customs duties on crude oil exports constituted 16.9% of tax revenues in 2019, \nthey are estimated to drop by more than 71%, and vanish completely if oil prices remain below $25 per barrel in the \nmedium term. Moreover, the state of emergency and the quarantine measures significantly hurt the service industry. \n15 National Fund of the Republic of Kazakhstan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16 Central Asian Bureau for Analytical Reporting, February 2020. \n ", "6   \na serious crisis with prolonged border closures could threaten the food security in Central Asia.17 \nKazakhstan\u2019s pandemic and recession mitigation effort has aspects of a regional public good. \nB.

A major anti-crisis package was approved of about $13 billion (8%\u20139% of GDP; Appendix \n4, tables A4.1\u2013A4.2 present the measures by on-budget and off-budget categorization),18 with: \nan effective health policy response ($338.4 million); properly targeted measures to protect \nemployment and the segments of the population that are most vulnerable to the current crisis, \nincluding women ($7.18 billion); and economic stimulus measures ($5.97 billion).19  \n1.  COVID-19 Health Policy Response \n \n14.  Early pre-COVID-19 readiness and public health response plans. The government \nstarted preparations well ahead of the infection breakout in the country and took several swift and \ndecisive containment, health care, and other social measures in response to the COVID-19 threat, \nin close coordination with development partners and neighboring countries (Table 2). \nTable 2: Summary of COVID-19 Preparation Measures \n#  Measures ($338.4 million) \n1  On 6 January 2020 the Ministry of Healthcare (MOH) approved the main preparedness activities to mitigate \nepidemiological outbreaks. International travelers, depending on the country of origin, were placed under \nmandatory 14-day isolation or self-quarantine. An Inter-sectoral Committee on COVID-19, chaired by the Deputy \nPrime-Minister, was set up to ensure full coordination, and an action plan was approved on 29 January 2020 for \nimmediate  implementation.  All  transportation  between  Kazakhstan  and  countries  highly  affected  by  the \ncoronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been suspended since 3 February 2020, and screening at entry points and \nmedical monitoring of those coming from countries affected by COVID-19 were established. \n2  MOH approved the COVID-19 infection treatment clinic protocol in early February. The protocol is continuously \ndiscussed with leading international specialists and updated to reflect latest developments in the diagnostics and \ntreatment of COVID-19. MOH, with the support of the World Health Organization and the involvement of national \nstakeholders, continues to identify possible improvements in the overall response. During February\u2013March 2020, \nmore than 28,492 beds were deployed in the country for the hospitalization of COVID-19 patients and contact \npersons.a Three fully equipped medical complexes were newly set up. \n3  Overall, the government allocated $53.4 million for the procurement of supplies, including central and regional \nprocurement of personal protective equipment, disinfectants and medicines, and medical devices; and an \nadditional $285 million to boost the capacity of the health care system.b The government also extended free \naccess to full COVID-19-related medical care for all citizens, through the state medical system in public hospitals. \n4  Systematic public communication was established. A hotline was set up for medical professionals and the public. \nInformation on the ongoing COVID-19 emergency and on individual protection measures is being circulated \nthrough various channels such as daily briefings on TV, radio, and social media (e.g., Facebook, Telegram). A \nnewly created webpage (www.coronavirus2020.kz) also provides information and updates. \na  Of which 2,669 are for infectious cases, 8,098 are of the pharmacist type, and 17,725 are for quarantine purposes. \nHospitals designated for the treatment of COVID-19 received 182 resuscitation beds with proper equipment (e.g., \nmechanical ventilation devices and monitors). MOH also mobilized more than 10,000 medical workers to provide \nCOVID-19-related medical care and has an additional 802 trained specialists on standby. \nb  These are also for anti-epidemiological measures. The total of T125.2 billion includes T40.6 billion for premiums to \ndoctors in the front line, T19.5 billion for payment to medical organizations, T14.8 billion for the preparation of three \nmedical complexes, T30.8 million for food and household sets, T8.1 billion for premiums to employees and medical \nworkers of law enforcement, T4.1 billion for communication services, and T5.6 billion forensic medical examination. \nSource: Government of Kazakhstan. \n \n17 Kazakhstan placed a quota on the export of wheat flour. This has sparked concerns that the economic crisis brought \nabout by the coronavirus pandemic could spark a wave of food security concerns, with certain countries left short of \ncertain products in the face of hoarding by states. Kazakhstan is a key supplier to Central Asian neighbors, including \nUzbekistan and countries further away such as Afghanistan. \n18 All these measures are fiscal in nature, but we refer to those that are off-budget as quasi-fiscal. \n19 A more comprehensive description of all the different anti-crisis initiatives is in COVID-19 Public Health Response \nand Countercyclical Response Policies (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \n15.  Medical and social lockdown interventions upon the outbreak of COVID-19. When \nthe first imported cases were detected on 13 March 2020, all were immediately isolated and \ntreated. Initial infections spread in Nur-Sultan (the capital city) and Almaty (the largest city), and \nall contacts were quarantined and tested. Table 3 summarizes the new actions. \nTable 3: Summary of Non-Pharmaceutical and other COVID-19 Interventions \n#  Measures \n1  As an immediate reaction, the just-established Emergency Operations Center (EOC) began 24-hour monitoring \nof the COVID-19 situation globally, regionally, and nationally, and started collecting information on persons \narriving from affected countries. Those arriving from highly affected countries were placed in 14-day quarantine. \n2  When the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic, Kazakhstan declared a state of \nemergency.  All  places  of  mass  gatherings  were  closed,  public  events  were  cancelled,  large  family \ncommemorative events were banned. Stringent enforcement measures aimed at preventing the spread of the \ndisease, such as penalties for persons evading medical examinations, were applied. Quarantines and lockdowns \nwere announced on 17 March 2020 for the country\u2019s three largest cities and were subsequently introduced in \nother regions. The government deployed regional response teams consisting of local government, health care, \nsocial care, civil society, and private sector representatives to identify evolving needs, support vulnerable groups, \nand establish feedback to central coordination teams. Mobile teams were assigned in every region to provide \ncare and to transport suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases to hospitals. \n3  The National Reference Laboratory in March received test kits from the People's Republic of China, the Russian \nFederation, and WHO, and jointly with the National Biotechnology Center started to develop own testing systems. \nTo date, no other developing member country in Asia tests more in per capita terms than Kazakhstan. \n4  Kazakhstan intensified its surveillance by enhancing the capacity for active case finding. The Ministry of \nHealthcare, with the support of WHO, continues to improve the system for contact tracing and monitoring. The \nEOC also developed geographic information system tools to monitor the COVID-19 spread. \nSource: Government of Kazakhstan.  \n  2.  Social Protection and Employment Protection Measures \n16.  The government is implementing initiatives that combine liquidity relief, income support, \nunemployment insurance, and support to the most vulnerable sectors of activity (Table 4; more \ndetails on targeting are included in the design and monitoring framework [DMF], in Appendix 1).  \nTable 4: Fiscal Response to Protect Incomes, Jobs, and the Most Vulnerable \n#  Measures ($7.18 billion in total)  Cost  \n1  Income support. Cash payments ($95 per month) for those who lost labor income under the   \nstate of emergency.a The target is 3 million people, and this is implemented by the State Social  $877 million \nSecurity Fund. All those that work in the informal labor market\u2014mostly women\u2014can apply.  \n2  Food support. A lower value-added tax rate was set for food,b and various other responses   \nhelp mitigate the impact of higher food prices. A nationwide food supply program was established  $113 million \nwith T45.8 billion for local authorities to provide free food sets to more than 1.1 million people \n(primarily elderly people, large families, and people with disabilities, i.e., those registered in the \nsocial vulnerability ledger). In parallel, the government introduced price caps on essential foods. \n3  Social transfers increase. To help vulnerable groups (e.g. pensioners) cope with possible hikes   \nin food prices, the government increased all social payments by 10%. This would include about  $503 million \n32,000 households currently covered by the unconditional cash transfer program, and 129,000 \nhouseholds covered by conditional cash aid under the government\u2019s targeted social support.  \n4  Tax and utility cost relief. In addition to significant utility subsidies and automatic reductions in   \nthe tax base, in March 2020 the government introduced tax support measures targeting mainly  $5.68 billion. \nmicro and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in agriculture, trade, and services. This \nincludes a reduction to zero in the rates of property tax (for retail, trade, catering, entertainment, \ntourism, and hospitality businesses), land tax (for agricultural producers), and income tax (for \nindividual entrepreneurs). A six-month exemption from payroll taxes was also introduced for \nSMEs in these sectors. Tax reporting deadlines were also extended until September 2020. c  \na  The government partnered with civil society organizations and the private sector to monitor this program.  \nb   The value-added tax on the import and sale of food products of social significance was reduced from 12% to 8%. \nc   All payments of taxes and other compulsory payments for SMEs were deferred. Collection of overdue tax obligations \nwas suspended, as well as the accrual of penalties for overdue tax obligations until August 2020.  \nSource: Government of Kazakhstan. \n ", "8   \n  3.  Economic Stimulus Measures  \n17.  The government prioritized existing major development programs to integrate additional \nmeasures in 2020 in support of employment, business activity and financial stability\u2014 e.g. the (i) \nEconomy of Simple Things (EST); (ii) Business Development Roadmap 2020 (BDR-2020); and \n(iii) Employment Roadmap 2020 (EM-2020).  \nTable 5: Economic Stimulus Measures \n#  Measures ($5.97 billion in total)  Cost  \n1  Promotion of rural employment through microloans and grants. Additional state budget  $239 million \nfunding for the Enbek and Auyl Besygi Program, which includes vocational and entrepreneurship \ntraining and financial support in rural towns dominated by a single activity or company.  \n2  Support for employment among vulnerable population. Additional state budget funding for  $306 million \nthe BDR-2020, for subsidized loans to SMEs to support employment among vulnerable   \npopulations (targeting 535,000 jobs mostly in rural areas). \n3  Employment promotion.

To support financial stabilization, the Baiterek  $1.59 billion \nNational Management Holding (Baiterek) will also provide significant liquidity under the EM-\n2020, to boost lending under subsidized rates. This program is off-budget, and includes support \nfor  (a)  new  projects  related  to  the  reconstruction  of  social,  transport,  and  public  utility \ninfrastructure, and (b) to incentivize the unemployed youth to participate in the new jobs program \nin flood control, spring field work, construction, and other works, the government will provide \none-time financial assistance of T85,000 on top of the standard salary. a  \n5  Financial stabilization of Firms. Through the Economy of Simple Things program, a wide  $2.27 billion \nrange of industries will be covered for support, including through financial guarantees (30%\u2013\n50% of funding) and subsidized rates (6%\u20138%) for ultimate borrowers. This will be coordinated \nby, and cost $1 billion to Baiterek. As part of the Economy of Simple Things program, the NBK \nwill also facilitate the provision of $1.27 billion to second-tier banks to subsidize loans to micro \nand SMEs, through the KSF (a 100% subsidiary of NBK). b \n6  Mortgage finance to the most vulnerable. To promote the expansion of homeownership  $886 million \namong the most vulnerable and simultaneously renew demand for construction activity, Baiterek \nwill finance a housing finance program (i.e. mortgages) to cover 120,000 borrowers (with at least \n60% women; see details on targeting in the DMF, Appendix 1. The housing finance program will \nbe implemented off-budget, financed by the issuance of municipal bonds to Baiterek. \nBDR = Business Development Roadmap; DMF = design and monitoring framework; EM = emerging markets; KSF = \nKazakhstan Sustainability Fund; NBK = National Bank of Kazakhstan; SMEs = small and medium-sized enterprises.  \na These programs will also provide soft loans to manufacturing and agribusiness sectors, fuel price subsidies for \nfarmers, interest rate subsidies and new guarantee instruments to facilitate leasing operations and bank guarantees. \nThe government has tightened the local-content criteria for new projects, covering both goods and services (90% \nmust come from local content) and jobs (50% of employees must be hired through regional employment centers). \nThe EM-2020 will be implemented off-budget by Baiterek.  \nb   The KSF will place a conditional deposit with accredited banks under conditions: 12 months tenor; pricing will be 5% \nfor banks for on-lending to SMEs at up to 8%; the explicit purpose is to facilitate new working capital to SMEs and \nindividual entrepreneurs under stress due to the state of emergency. Maximum exposures per borrower were set. \nSource: Government of Kazakhstan. \n \n18.

To encourage credit institutions \nto implement this restructuring, deferred loan payment efforts will not entail impairment or provisioning \nfor regulatory requirements. This is expected to release an additional T168.0 billion ($385 million) for \nlending. To ensure the efficient implementation of the measures, the ARDFM is launching mechanisms \nto ensure that a moratorium on payments does not entail negative information on borrowers being sent \nto the Credit Bureau, and mechanisms to ensure that total loan contract payments do not exceed the \ninitially scheduled ones. Borrowers have recourse to the ARDFM for additional review. The ARDFM also \nexpanded the list of collaterals in financing projects under state business support programs and \nintroduced a low risk weighting on loans to SMEs, public\u2013private partnerships, and syndicated loans. \nThe ARDFM also announced new regulatory measures (tightening of provisions calculation), based on \nthe results of a recent asset quality review (AQR) of the banks, will be postponed until 1 October 2020.c \na  Among other things, this included a ban on interest accrual for consumer loans overdue more than 90 days, no fines \nand penalties for late payments on loans and microcredits if caused by the state of emergency, and a grace period \nof up to 90 days for SMEs and individual borrowers that experience financial hardship. \nb   Including a regulatory loosening for lending to SMEs, with a reduction in risk weights for SME exposures. \nc   In August 2019, the NBK had announced the start of a sweeping AQR of the top 14 banks of the country, covering \n87% of total banking assets. The AQR report, published in February 2020, concluded that the majority of assessed \nbanks had sufficient capital to comply with the regulatory standards and to cover expected credit losses. \nSource: Government of Kazakhstan. \n19.  Program outcome, impact and outputs. The outcome of the Program is: \u201cSpread of the \ndisease managed and of poverty contained.\u201d The Program\u2019s impact is: \u201cAdverse impacts of \nCOVID-19 on the population\u2019s health, incomes, and economic opportunities mitigated.\u201d21 The \nthree outputs of the Program are: (i) immediate COVID-19 health response implemented; (ii) \nsocial protection and employment protection measures implemented; and (iii) economic stimulus \ndelivered.  The  Program  is  designed  to  ensure  that  the  overall  fiscal  stimulus  package  is \nimplemented  and  monitored,  since  the complementarity  of  all  its  components  is  crucial  to \nsustaining incomes and employment recovery, and the individual targets across all three outputs. \nTo reinforce this requirement, output 3 also includes it as an indicator, implying that 8%\u20139% of \nGDP in automatic and discretionary stimulus measures will be necessary. The development \nproblem for the proposed ADB assistance requires this to ensure an effective mitigation of the \ncurrently heightened social vulnerability risks. Taking into account the range of policy responses \nof the government, the depth of the economic recession in 2020 is now expected to be between \na 0.9% contraction (the government assessment) and a 2.4% contraction (assuming very small \nfiscal multipliers, in line with International Monetary Fund [IMF] forecasts) (Figure 5).

Development partner coordination has been open and effective. The frequency of \nconsultations on macroeconomic surveillance between ADB, the IMF, and the World Bank (WB) \nhas increased, and the dialogue with the government and the NBK is well coordinated, frank, and \nproductive.  Although  the  IMF  is  not  involved  in  the  financing  side  of  the  government\u2019s \ncountercyclical support efforts,22 it engages with the government across all the key areas related \nto macroeconomic surveillance, fiscal risks, financial sector stability, and also in ongoing work on \nfinancial supervision and monitory policy. Current ADB discussions with the IMF team focused on \nmacroeconomic and fiscal projections, and on key risks to the current outlook.23 ADB has also \nbeen exploring, with the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and WHO, potential health-\nrelated support. The WB was approached for potential budget support for 2021.24 The ADB team \nis closely working with the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) to secure cofinancing for \n$750 million of budget support. ADB and AIIB agreed with the government to conduct joint review \nmissions for implementation of the Program. \n21.  Lessons learned. The government\u2019s anti-crisis plan and the Program benefit from the \nexperience of past crises and of previous ADB Countercyclical Support Facility (CSF) assistance \nto Kazakhstan: \n  \n(i)  With regards to the government\u2019s macroeconomic policy response to the present \ncrisis, the exchange rate adjustment by the monetary authorities of Kazakhstan in \nearly 2020 was of substantial importance. Failure to do so early enough in 2015 \nwas a significant mistake, as ADB and other development partners subsequently \nanalyzed. Also, the abrupt and disorderly nature of the currency depreciation, \nwhen it finally happened in 2015, exacerbated pressures in the banking system \nand the credit contraction that ensued then led to a steeper contraction in the \neconomy and likely delayed the economic recovery.25  \n(ii)  The current emphasis on social protection, income support and use of existing \nstate programs also reflects an important lesson from past countercyclical efforts \nin general: it is difficult to credibly fast-track conventional public works or have a \nlist of \u201cshovel-ready\u201d projects when a crisis arrives.   \n(iii)  With  regards  to  coordination,  implementation,  and  reporting,  Kazakhstan\u2019s \ninstitutional division of responsibilities for the anti-crisis plan and PFM systems are \neffective, and have been well tested by previous ADB CSF assistance. The \nlessons from past operations (some of which are formally addressed in program \ncompletion reports) were discussed with the government and also informed the \ncurrently proposed implementation arrangements\u2014by establishing the Ministry of \nFinance (MOF) as the executing agency for the proposed ADB assistance, in \ncharge of monitoring and submitting to ADB quarterly reports on budget execution \nand on the flow of funds related to countercyclical measures (as well as appointing \nother key line ministries as implementing agencies to report on the ultimate results \n \n22 By law, the government is not allowed to seek IMF fiscal financing. It can only seek budget support from development \ninstitutions such as ADB and the World Bank. IMF financing can only be sought by the National Bank of Kazakhstan \n(as the issuer of the liability), and presumably for balance-of-payment reasons. \n23 ADB discussions with the IMF have been frequent and productive. In January, the IMF had conducted an Article IV \nconsultation. In March 2020, after the COVID-19 crisis reached Kazakhstan, the IMF held a series of comprehensive \nconsultations  with  the  Ministry  of  National  Economy  and  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  on  the  revised \nmacroeconomic outlook, fiscal projections, and the government\u2019s crisis response measures.  \n24 Discussions between ADB and the WB are frequent. WB budget support for 2020 is likely not possible due to the \ndifficulties in designing a meaningful policy-based loan that could still be disbursed in 2020.  \n25 Details in: ADB. 2017.

ADB\u2019s  Value  Addition.  ADB  and  Kazakhstan  have  a  trusted  and  multi-faceted \npartnership,  including  in  managing  recent  crises  and  designing  appropriate  countercyclical \nresponses. A key part of the recent and ongoing policy dialogue does benefit from past joint \nreviews  and  assessments  of  the  completed  crises  response  programs,  which  assessed \nsuccesses and weaknesses and identified ways of improving design and implementation of future \nprograms. Technical assistance and knowledge collaboration have been another key means of \nengagement, which helped establish the current avenues of crisis and reform related policy \nengagement of ADB: (i) technical assistance initiatives of immediate relief to help pilot better-\ntargeting approaches are under preparation;28 and (ii) technical assistance to support key crisis-\nmanagement policy decisions is both being implemented29 and under processing (e.g. public debt \nmanagement, fiscal risk management, etc.)30 Ongoing and planned technical assistance will help \nmonitor the implementation of the government\u2019s anti-crisis initiatives, allow for ADB to monitor \nand provide real-time feedback on the implementation of these. In addition, ongoing technical \nassistance on public debt and fiscal risk management will contribute to the design of ADB\u2019s \ncomprehensive medium-term engagement with Kazakhstan in support of comprehensive reforms \nin economic management and economic diversification. ADB\u2019s budget support and success in \ncatalyzing cofinancing from the AIIB will help reduce the worrisome depletion of the NFRK (see \nparas. 27\u201328). This joint ADB-AIIB financing effort will support the regional public goods nature \nof Kazakhstan\u2019s anti-crisis support efforts (with its potential health, employment and income \nspillovers onto Uzbekistan, Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan). As discussed in para. 12, the \nProgram will directly support the implementation of the regional public goods pillar of ADB\u2019s \nRegional Cooperation and Integration Operational Plan 2019\u20132020,31 and the operational cluster \nfive of CAREC 2030, related to transboundary communicable diseases. \n23.  Strategic  Context  of  ADB  Engagement  in  Kazakhstan.  Under  ADB\u2019s  country \nassistance in Kazakhstan, reform-focused technical assistance is also being designed to help \nmitigate the potential crisis-induced scarring of Kazakhstan\u2019s non-oil economic potential. This \nreform-focused engagement includes priority areas such as micro and SMEs\u2019 access to finance \nand financial inclusion reforms, green finance, and other reforms to enhance the economic \nrecovery and the productive potential of the non-oil economy. These TA areas complement the \nongoing programming of ADB's assistance pipeline for 2021\u20132023, which focuses on supporting \nagricultural productivity and commercialization, SMEs development, and the greening of the \n \n26 Past CSF experience in Kazakhstan was satisfactory on the fiduciary front. Several measures in the government's \nanti-crisis program are very well targeted, and the program\u2019s design and monitoring framework fully reflects it. ADB \ntechnical assistance will accompany the implementation effort. Quarterly reporting will ensure frequent consultations.  \n27 Tranching raises the question of what to make disbursement conditional on. Previous experience of \u201ctranching\u201d the \nCSF disbursements was not positive, and it does not seem that it should be repeated. Para. 38 of the completion \nreport for the 2015 CSF highlighted the lack of justification for the special features introduced then as tranche release \nconditions, and its potential counterproductive role in delaying financial support disbursement as a critical design \nsetback. It also questioned the emphasis on issues that were not relevant to the then circumstances of Kazakhstan.  \n28 Through the ADB\u2013Kazakhstan Solidarity Fund (to be cofinanced in parity terms with the Government of Kazakhstan). \nThis includes the piloting of better approaches to food and medicine relief to vulnerable people, establishing \ndedicated business support services to affected SMEs, and assist in skills re-training programs for unemployed. \n29 ADB. 2018.

This will be explored in close coordination with WB and AIIB.  The Program is aligned with \nADB\u2019s Strategy 2030. Its focus on helping to address current poverty, inequality and gender risks \nis  in  line  with  Operational  Priority  (OP)  1\u2013Addressing  Remaining  Poverty  and  Reducing \nInequalities,  and  with  OP2\u2013Accelerating  Progress  in  Gender  Equality.  Its  support  for \nmacroeconomic and financial stabilization and to ring-fence public service-delivery from ongoing \nfiscal  shocks  is  in  line  with  OP6\u2013Strengthening  governance  and  institutional  capacity.  As \ndiscussed  in  paras.  12  and  22,  the  Program  is  also  in  line  with  OP7\u2013Fostering  Regional \nCooperation and Integration. \n24.  Kazakhstan\u2019s Structural Reform Momentum. Kazakhstan is among the top 30 countries \nin  the  World  Bank's  Doing  Business  ranking,  and  the  government  has  been  adopting \nunprecedented system-wide reforms aimed at improving the business climate and reducing \nadministrative barriers and business costs. These reforms have been reducing red tape for \nentrepreneurs and are moving the whole country toward global good practices in business \nregulation.33 But reform processes are medium-term in nature and it is crucial to ensure that the \ncurrent moment of economic and social distress does not affect ongoing reform preparation \nprocesses or the reform drive of stakeholders. The government is committed to ensuring that the \nongoing crisis will not affect its reform momentum, and it has re-affirmed its commitment to, for \nexample, (i) continue its structural reforms and its ambitious agenda for the greening of the \neconomy, and (ii) fiscal consolidation to reduce public sector dependency on oil-revenues. \nC.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n \n25.  All the off-budget anti-crisis measures are self-funded by the government. All the on-\nbudget anti-crisis measures have already been reflected in the recently approved revisions to the \ngovernment budget.34 These include a combination of automatic and discretionary reductions in \ntax revenue of about $3.9 billion, and of new expenditures (net of cuts and some expenditure \nrationalizations)35 of about $3.1 billion. Overall, the on-budget anti-crisis package (and net new \nfinancing needs) of the government total about $7 billion.36 On the funding side, additional \ntransfers from the NFRK, the country\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, will be able to close this gap by \nabout $4.7 billion\u2013$5 billion equivalent. With these additional transfers, the total transfers from the \nNFRK will amount to $10.9 billion in 2020, representing a significant use of NFRK resources (it \nwill deplete more than 18% of the accumulated funds of the NFRK),37 and it is at the limit of what \nwould be consistent with the NFRK's medium-term main mandate. The remaining $2 billion will \nneed to come from additional domestic and external debt issuance (Table 6).  \n \n32 The government is embarking on ambitious green economy reforms, aiming to reduce environmental pollution \nthrough sustainable waste management, the diversification of coal-based energy mix through use of renewable \nenergy sources, and the reduction of energy intensity through comprehensive sector reforms and the development \nof geothermal energy regulations.

It already had cancelled international and local events, and \nannounced plans to cancel or delay some capital expenditures. There is a risk of a further increase in expenditure \noutlays for imports of capital goods because of the sharp local currency depreciation.  \n36 The off-budget anti-crisis measures of about $5.6 billion are all funded by other government institutions and SOEs. \n37 As of the end of February 2020, NFRK assets were estimated at $57 billion or 38% of 2019 GDP.  \n ", "13 \nTable 6: Development Financing Needs in 2020  \n(in T billion, unless otherwise stated) \nItem  Original  Revised  Change  Change \nState  State  [T/$=430] \nBudget  Budget  (in $ billion) \nRevenues  8,616.2  6,950.0  (1,666.2)  (3.90) \nExpenditures  12,914.2  14,270.7  1,356.5  3.10 \nBudget balance    (4,298.0)  (7,320.7)  (3,022.7)  (7.00) \nTotal budget financing needed:  4,298.0  7,320.7  3,022.7  7.00 \n   NFRK transfers (including return transfer) a  2,700.0  4,882.0  2,182.0   5.00a \n   Borrowing  1,598.0  2,438.7  840.7  2.00 \n Net domestic borrowing  1,366.9  1,682.2  315.3  0.70 \n     Net external borrowing  231.2  755.8  524.6  1.30 \n   a) From the ADB Program    430.0  430.0  1.00 \n   b) From AIIB (cofinancing the Program)    322.5  322.5  0.75 \n   c) others b  231.2  3.3    (227.9)  (0.53) \n( ) = negative, ADB = Asian Development Bank, AIIB = Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, NFRK = National Fund \nof Republic of Kazakhstan \na  When set in the revised budget, the foreign currency equivalent was $4.7 billion, at a different exchange rate than \nthe one in this table. This makes its presentation in the last column (and of the numbers below it) challenging. \nb  In the original budget, this included the issuance of external bonds totaling T500 billion.

Kazakhstan\u2019s  public  debt  will  remain  sustainable  for  the \nforeseeable future (ADB\u2019s DSA is in linked document 7). The current fiscal effort is making a \nmuch-needed use of the available fiscal space. But the domestic debt market, which was still \nnascent before the crisis, is still illiquid.38 Up until now, government securities issuance had \nfocused on the tenors (i.e. medium to long-term) that were of least interest to most financial market \nplayers (and mostly of interest to pension funds, which display hold-to-maturity behavior and don\u2019t \ncontribute to price discovery), for (i) lack of capacity to manage refinancing risk and (ii) because \nthe NBK issues the shorter tenors of the yield structure (for systemic liquidity management \npurposes).39 The resulting  lack  of trading  liquidity  in  government  securities  has  now  been \nexacerbated by heightened uncertainty in financial markets regarding future short-term rates, \nwhich impairs pricing. Even though from May 2020 the government securities issuance plan \nalready reflects a sharp shift in priority towards shorter, potentially more liquid tenors, 40 it will still \nbe a challenge to fulfill current borrowing plans through an asset class that is still incipient in terms \nof outstanding amounts.41 Government borrowing from ADB or any other form of concessional \nfinance (like the proposed Program) will have a minimal impact on debt-to-GDP ratio going \nforward, and should be a priority. From a fiscal management perspective and in line with what \nhas  been  the  consensus  technical  advice,  the  government  should  maximize  all  affordable \nborrowing options at the current crisis stage to avoid tapping on the NFRK given that the currently-\nplanned sale of depressed international financial assets will likely result in additional realization \nof valuation losses.42 Kazakhstan public sector remains a net creditor today, but projected debt \nlevels are now expected to reach 30% of GDP by 2024\u20132025.  \n \n38 ADB TA is supporting MOF\u2019s State Borrowings Department in developing a medium-term debt strategy and market-\nbased borrowing practices to: (i) better optimize risk-cost trade-offs; (ii) chart key actions to develop the government \nsecurities market (and investor base); and (iii) improve agency coordination for cash and debt management.  \n39 95% of the amount issued in government securities in 2019 was for tenors of 10\u201320 years.  \n40 https://kase.kz/en/gsecs/release_schedule.  \n41 The trading liquidity of an asset class significantly depends on an adequate level of already outstanding amounts.  \n42 After the currency shocks of 2015, which had an extremely negative impact on the debt portfolio of the government, \nthe MOF adhered to a policy of borrowing preferably in the domestic market, in order to gradually level out the \n \n ", "14   \n27.  The National Fund of the Republic of Kazakhstan. Large withdrawals from NFRK in \n2020\u201321 to finance the current crisis response43 will further worsen a declining trend and bring its \nlevel to 30% of GDP by 2024\u20132025, which will breach a key threshold buffer in Kazakhstan\u2019s \nfiscal rules. 44 The government might also therefore no longer be a net creditor by 2024. In 2017, \nthe WB had concluded that unless the new set of fiscal rules and consolidation plans were \nadopted, a full depletion of net fiscal savings in around 5\u201310 years would be the result.45 A 2018 \nEBRD report for Kazakhstan actually gave Kazakhstan only a 12-year window to build fiscal \nresilience.46 ADB has also been providing policy advice on debt management development that \nis consistent with the concerns expressed before the crisis by the World Bank, IMF and EBRD, \nand has emphasized the need to (i) target net debt objectives in a way that fully takes into account \nall the financial and institutional trade-offs involved in borrowing vis-a-vis tapping on NFRK, and \n(ii) fully-incorporate the urgency to ring-fence the NFRK against foreseeable depletion risks. As a \nresult of the current crisis and the significant transfers already approved to the revisions to the \nState Budget for 2020, the NFRK is expected to end the year at $57 billion (38% of GDP), which \ncompares with $73 billion at its peak in 2014. Drawing down further on NFRK could affect the \nsovereign rating and increase refinancing costs, and also make market access more sensitive to \nswings in investor sentiment due to external factors (e.g., global or regional developments).47 \nFurther depletion of NFRK also puts at risk its mandates of inter-generational equity and fiscal \nstabilization. By significantly using fiscal savings sourced from exploring a finite national asset in \nthe recent past, the NFRK de-facto stood behind the capacity of the government to keep \nmacroeconomic and banking stability.48 But these mandates are now at risk, also due to the \nfrequency of significant and correlated shocks to which Kazakhstan is exposed: the current \ndollarization-related  financial  fragilities  in  Kazakhstan, the  lack  of  a  developed  non-mineral \ntradables economy (and of a non-oil tax base), and the significant exposure to terms-of-trade \nshocks are all, in many ways, the other side of the past oil revenue boom \"coin\". \n \ncurrency risks of its debt portfolio. However, the currently higher term premiums in the domestic market and lack of \nliquidity, as well as need for supporting the currency, force a revision in borrowing policy, towards external borrowing. \n43 $10.9 billion in 2020 and $5.8 billion in 2021 (based on fiscal projections). By 2022\u20132025, in both ADB and IMF \nDSAs, additional debt issuance is actually factored in to finance replenishment of the NFRK. \n44 The government adopted a new NFRK framework of rules in late 2016. These include the following: (i) the non-oil \ndeficit, the main anchor of fiscal policy, was to be progressively decreased to 7 percent of GDP by 2020, and 6 \npercent by 2025; (ii) guaranteed transfers from the NFRK were to be reduced from the US$8 billion of the time to \nUS$6 billion by 2020 (at 2016 exchange rates); (iii) the NFRK assets are to be maintained at least at 30 percent of \nGDP; (iv) privatization revenues are to flow to the NFRK; and (v) general government debt and external debt of state-\nowned enterprises are not to exceed the size of NFRK assets. These rules are enforced by the Commission on \nControl of Usage of NFRK Funds, which is chaired by NBK Governor and includes Prosecutor General, Chairman of \nNational Security Committee, Chairman of Accounts Committee, Chairman of Anti-Corruption Committee, as well as \nministers of finance and national economy as members. Any deviation from the rules need to be approved by the \nPresident of the Republic of Kazakhstan and the Parliament.  \n45 Kostopoulos, Christos; Sarsenov, Ilyas. 2017.

London: PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.  \n47 IMF. 2017. Republic of Kazakhstan: Selected Issues, Country Report No. 17/109. Washington, D.C. In this 2017 \nreport, IMF noted that while the debt-to-GDP ratio was expected to remain low in the medium-term scenario, market \naccess on favorable terms could come under question with continued drainage of NFRK assets, as markets would \nexpect Kazakhstan to accumulate financial assets, rather than to drain them, given its oil resources. The IMF has \nhad TA discussions with MOF to simplify the fiscal rule design when timing is appropriate. As a key credibility \nconsideration, fiscal rules should not be changed when they are binding. A key objective however will remain to ring-\nfence the NFRK from further depletion. \n48 Kazakhstan benefited greatly from the oil price super-cycle of 2000\u20132014. But funds accumulated at the NFRK were \n(i) used for anti-crisis programs in 2007\u20132010 (during which the fiscal stimulus program totaled US$18 billion, or 15 \npercent of GDP), (ii) used in foreign-currency interventions in 2014\u20132015 (more than US$30 billion), and (iii) used to \nfinance part of the economic recovery package in 2014\u20132017 of more than US$20 billion (12 percent of GDP). \n ", "15 \n28.  The government has requested two loans from ADB\u2014(i) a regular loan of \u20ac454,298,000 \n($500 million equivalent) and (ii) a regular loan of \u20ac454,298,000 ($500 million equivalent), both \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources but with different tenors, to help finance the proposed \nProgram. The first loan will have a 10-year term, including a grace period of 3 years, with an \nannual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other terms and \nconditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. For the first loan, based on the straight line \nmethod, the average maturity is 6.75 years and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. \nThe second loan will have a 5-year term, including a grace period of 3 years; an annual interest \nrate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility; a commitment charge of \n0.15% per year; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement.  For \nthe second loan, based on the straight line method, the average maturity is 4.25 years and there \nis no maturity premium payable to ADB. The loans are expected to be disbursed by November \n2020. AIIB is expected to provide $750 million support in parallel cofinancing. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n29.  MOF  will  be  the  Program\u2019s  executing  agency,  responsible  for  monitoring  the \nimplementation and reporting on its progress (centralizing all the reporting on the DMF indicators \nand its sex-disaggregated data requirements). The implementing agencies will be the Ministry of \nNational  Economy  (responsible  for  the  overall  coordination  of  the  government's  anti-crisis \nmeasures and the implementation of SME support), MOH (responsible for implementing the \nhealth  sector  response),  the  Ministry  of  Labour  and  Social  Protection  of  the  Population \n(responsible for social protection and the implementation of the Employment Roadmap), and the \nMinistry of Industry and Infrastructure Development (in charge of implementing the affordable \nhousing program). MOF will monitor the activities and expenditures under the Program and submit \nto ADB quarterly reports;49 it will also remain in dialogue with ADB until 6 months after the date \nof loan effectiveness on (i) the macroeconomic and fiscal situation (including financial stability \nchallenges),  and (ii) the  implementation  of the  Program. Ongoing  and  new  ADB  technical \nassistance will also support monitoring and reporting on all countercyclical measures in 2020. The \nproceeds of the loan will be withdrawn in one disbursement in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time). The Program implementation \nperiod is January 2020 to July 2021. The loan closing date is 31 December 2021.  \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n30.  Governance. An effective system of budget preparation and reporting has been in place \nfor years in Kazakhstan, with periodic budget execution made public on MOF's website. Migration \nto accrual-based accounting and financial reporting, in line with the International Public Sector \nAccounting Standards, has been an effective process, and improved budget efficiency and \ncontrol. 50 Recent audit-related legal reforms had a positive impact on fiduciary control. Revenue \ncollection is consolidated in one authority to create a favorable climate for businesses and reduce \n \n49 To the extent possible, monitoring and reporting will include sex-disaggregated data collection on beneficiaries of all \nprograms, and not only the data collection that is necessary to measure achievements against the targets of the \nGender Monitoring Matrix (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n50 ADB. 2017. Republic of Kazakhstan: Country Governance Risk Assessment. Manila. ADB completed a governance \nrisk assessment in 2017 according to the implementation guidelines of ADB\u2019s Second Governance and Anticorruption \nAction Plan. In 2018, the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) report on Kazakhstan highlighted \nmany of the same strengths\u2014e.g., budget reliability; public debt management; policy-based fiscal strategy and \nbudgeting in general, and legislative scrutiny of budgets in particular; predictability and control in budget execution \nin general, and internal controls and audit in particular; accounting and reporting in general, as well as external \nscrutiny and audit\u2014and also identified weak areas for improvement. \n ", "16   \nadministrative barriers. Procurement is decentralized to national and regional bodies and is \nexecuted through the government's electronic procurement portal. Public procurement laws also \nwere continually updated to accommodate elements of e-procurement and the requirements of \nthe Eurasian Economic Union. A legal and institutional framework for combating corruption is in \nplace, 51 and recent progress has been noteworthy.52 ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \namended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and MOF. \n \n31.  Poverty and social. Between 2000 and 2019, Kazakhstan made substantial progress in \nreducing poverty. As the economy grew by an average of 7% during 2001\u20132016, the national \npoverty rate dropped from 46.7% in 2001 to 6.6% in 2019. Since 2011, Kazakhstan consistently \nrecorded low unemployment rates, with more than 25% of the employed being self-employed. \nThe current recessionary pressures, if not immediately addressed, may increase poverty levels.53 \nThe government\u2019s anti-crisis package is sizable and comprehensive enough to counter these \nrisks. It includes a combination of (i) funding for additional health-related expenditures (which also \nring-fences the poor and most vulnerable from COVID-19-related health costs); (ii) initiatives to \nprovide financial relief to SMEs and households; (iii) social protection initiatives that target the \npoor and most vulnerable (including women); and (iv) other fiscal and quasi-fiscal expenditure \nmeasures to help employment recover faster.  \n \n32.  Gender. The Program is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming because the \ncountercyclical response involves social sector measures to preserve the health, incomes, and \nlivelihoods of women, children, and low-income households. The Program reflects key features \nof an effective gender mainstreaming effort, in full recognition of the social vulnerability risks that \nwere identified. The participation of the working-age population in the labor force of Kazakhstan \nis 71.1%, and the country has the highest female labor force participation rate in Central Asia. \nHowever, the gender wage gap (in average wages, unemployment, and access to finance) that \nprevailed until the current crisis implies a disproportionate impact of the ongoing economic \ndisruption on women. The government\u2019s planned efforts are an important mitigating factor. \nGender targets were fully integrated into the design and monitoring framework of the Program \n(Appendix 1), both at the outcome level and across all outputs. The proposed program will help \nmanage key gender risks, such as the (i) need for protection of frontline health workers (estimated \nto be at least 55% women); (ii) loss of business by individual entrepreneurs (52% of whom are \nwomen), particularly smaller-scale entrepreneurs (42% of which are women); (iii) loss of income \nby those employed in the most affected sectors, most of whom are women; and (iv) need for \nsocial assistance to poor households. The proposed Program will ensure that health workers who \nare directly handling COVID-19 cases (at least 55% women) will be provided with properly fitting \npersonal protective equipment and receive salary bonuses. Women entrepreneurs as well as \nwomen workers will be provided with tax and other financial incentives. Poor households, \nincluding women-led families, will be provided with social payments and assistance. \n \n33.  Safeguards. In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the Program \nis classified category C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. The \nProgram is not expected to have any environmental or social safeguard impacts within the \nmeaning of the Safeguard Policy Statement.

Additional indicators to measure the effects may be \nidentified later and used to discuss the program\u2019s effectiveness as comprehensively as possible in the program \ncompletion report. \nc  The national poverty line is defined at 70% of the minimum subsistence rate or, on average for the first quarter of \n2020, T21,302. \nd   The bonuses are paid on top of the salary, on a monthly basis for the 3 months of March\u2013May, according to the risk \ncategorization of each medical employee. The highest-risk group (doctors and medical staff of intensive care and \nCOVID-19-designated facilities) receive 20 minimum wages (T850,000). The high-risk group (doctors and medical \nstaff of ambulance services, sanitation aviation staff) receive 10 minimum wages (T425,000). The moderate-risk \ngroup (e.g., sanitary epidemiology service staff, laboratory staff, doctors and medical staff of regular hospitals, \nmembers of regional emergency command centers) receive 5 minimum wages (T212,500). The payments are based \non actual work time spent by medical staff, based on work attendance and distribution data (which is available). Even \nthough more than 70% of health workers are women, ADB estimates that women will account for 55% of those in \nthe front line. This proportion will be monitored on a regular basis to ensure that the DMF indicator is updated as \nneeded. \ne  The ledger of food package recipients includes: children (6\u201318 years) subject to social payments (201,600 people); \nchildren with disabilities under 16 years and people with disabilities of all groups and ages (692,000); people in \ncharge of caring for a disabled child (82,000); and officially registered unemployed people (150,000). This totals \n1,125,600 target beneficiaries. \nf This would include about 32,000 households currently covered by the unconditional cash transfer program, and \n129,000 households covered by the conditional cash transfer program (footnote f). The transfer programs include \nunconditional and conditional cash aid under the government\u2019s targeted social support (TSS). TSS provides \ncomprehensive social assistance to low-income citizens, divided into 2 types: unconditional and conditional cash aid. \nUnconditional cash aid is provided to families with disabled members or families in which the only able-to-work family \nmember cannot find a job for objective reasons (such as caring for a child aged less than 3 years, a disabled child, \ndisabled persons, or an elderly person dependent on care and assistance). Unconditional cash aid is assigned for \nthe current quarter from the month when a person applies and is paid on a monthly basis. Conditional cash aid is \nintended for families with at least one able-bodied member, employed under the government\u2019s social contracts, and \nis paid for a maximum of 3 months. To receive TSS, low-income families (citizens) must contact the Population \nEmployment Center at the place of residence or, in rural areas, the akim of the village, settlement, or rural district \nwith an application and an identification card. TSS is assigned to citizens with a per capita income that does not \nexceed the poverty rate per each family member. Thus, the TSS amount per person (family) is calculated as the \ndifference between the average per capita income and the poverty rate established in the region, taking into account \neach family member. \ng  As discussed in Para 19 of the main text, the program is designed to ensure that the overall fiscal stimulus package \nis implemented and monitored, since the complementarity of all its components is crucial to sustaining incomes and \nemployment recovery, and the individual targets across all three outputs. To reinforce this requirement, output 3 also \nincludes this as an indicator, implying that 8%\u20139% of GDP of net stimulus measures will be necessary. The logical \nframework for the proposed ADB assistance requires this to ensure an effective mitigation of the currently heightened \nsocial vulnerability risks. \nh  According to the Ministry of Industry and Infrastructural Development, as of 1 January 2020, 540,200 people had \napplied to the local executive bodies for the subsidized housing finance program, of which 212,500 were civil servants \nand employees of budgetary organizations (a majority of which are women); 120,500 were families with a single \nparent (who tend to be single mothers); 60,800 were orphans; 43,500 were from people with disabilities (groups 1 \nand 2); 47,800 were from large families; 21,100 were families with children and disabilities; 18,000 were pensioners; \nand 16,000 represented other categories. The housing finance program will be implemented off-budget, financed by \nthe issuance of municipal bonds to Baiterek. \nSource: ADB. \n ", "  Appendix 2  21 \nLIST OF LINKED DOCUMENTS \nhttp://www.adb.org/Documents/RRPs/?id=54188-001-3   \n \n1.

Adverse Impact  a. Fiscal Health costs are rising with the COVID-19 epidemic, with not only the medical emergency but also the implementation \nof Exogenous  of health system preparedness measures, and the monitoring and tracing systems since early-January, ramping up dedicated \nShocksa  capacity in the health system to cope with worst case hospitalization scenarios, and subsidizing in 100% the COVID-related \nhealth costs. The medical emergency is being kept under control also as a result of the costly COVID-19 readiness \nimplementation measures initiated in early-January 2020 to build health system response capacity before the epidemic arrived \nin the country. The significant effort to ramp up the testing operation and the inherent logistics are reinforcing the confidence \nin the entire operation. On the other hand, the strict social containment measures implemented from March onwards, i.e. right \nafter the first confirmed cases, have been effective at dampening the epidemiological growth of COVID-19 in Kazakhstan. \nThe healthcare emergency remains a serious challenge and its fiscal costs are likely to become sizable. \n \nb. Significant economic and fiscal costs of the social lockdown measures will result from can be observed in the ongoing \ndisruptions in business turnover and employment. A recent OECD reportb highlights that \u201cExperts estimate that 300,000 SMEs \nhave stopped working nation-wide. In Almaty, the number of workers in factories decreased by 266,000 people and 80% of \nentrepreneurs have suspended their activities. At least 1.5 million citizens are estimated to be on unpaid leave or have lost \ntheir jobs due to the outbreak of COVID-19. According to official data, SMEs in the sectors most likely to be severely affected \n(trade, tourism, and catering) are estimated to employ over 1.6 million workers\u201d. This economic disruption, if prolonged, can \nbe devastating in the non-oil economy if sustained job losses and bankruptcies cannot be avoided. The lockdown is impacting \nthe micro, small and medium enterprise (MSME) sector in particular, as its turnover dropped by 75% according to recent \nenterprise surveys undertaken in early-April. These indicate that: (i) by 23 March, 48% of employees were already put on \nleave without pay and 13% had been terminated; and (ii) for Q2, 40% of employees were expected to be put on leave without \npay and 12% would be terminated. Some of the activities hardest hit directly were: tourism, hospitality, education, food \nservices, and manufacturing. Women can be most affected by restrictions on economic activity. Women account for more \nthan 65% of labor force in some of the most effected sectors (e.g. hospitality, education, wholesale and retail trade), \nown/manage a significant number of microenterprises, and are also a significant share of the informal labor market. \n \nc. The second economic shock came with the significant oil price shock, with large fiscal and financial sector consequences. \nAs the COVID-19 pandemic is shutting down large segments of economies from the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) to \nEurope to the United States since late February 2020, it is also becoming lethal in many developing and emerging economies \nfor its global external effects. This is hitting Kazakhstan now with particular significance as well. The collapsing of international \nprices of oil and other commodities (which determine 85% of Kazakhstan\u2019s export revenue), is now reinforced by a clear \nglobal recessionary outlook for 2020. The resulting exchange rate pressures have also led to a hike in financial costs across \nthe economy. A sudden stop in capital flows has also hit emerging markets (EMs). April data shows cumulative outflows from \nEMs since the COVID-19 crisis began that are extraordinary in magnitude, even by the standards of the global financial crisis. \nThis sudden stop, coupled with low commodity prices and global recession, is closing down wholesale external funding lines \nto both financial and non-financial corporate sectors in Kazakhstan alike. This will directly hit financial firms (e.g. banks) with \noutstanding foreign-current debt that needs to be refinanced, but indirectly it will also affect the refinancing possibilities of all \nfirms and individuals with foreign-currency denominated debt. \n ", "28  Appendix 4 \nd. Without a fiscal response, the economy can contract in real terms by 5.5% in 2020 (instead of the 4% growth that had also \nbeen projected on average for 2020-2023 as late as in February 2020). The ongoing collapse in export revenues brought \nabout exchange-rate pressures that the monetary authorities allowed to sway while raising policy rates to 12% (from 9.25%) \nto smooth the currency depreciation process. The foreign-exchange reserves that were spent were appropriately geared to \nsimply smooth this exchange-rate realignment. But debt-servicing costs in the economy have\u2014also as a consequence\u2014\ngone up in both local currency credit and foreign currency credit contracts.  This is adding pressures to the asset quality of \nthe banking sector, which can also further constrain access to finance to SMEs going forward. These developments have \nforced significant downward revisions in the macroeconomic and fiscal outlook of Kazakhstan for 2020 now mired in deep \nrecession risks. The ongoing disruptions can leave medium-term scars in the productive potential of its non-oil economy too. \nPoverty rates could reach 11%\u201313%, and vulnerable segments of the population (including women) can be severely affected. \n \ne. Social Vulnerabilities, Poverty and Gender Risks. Unless countered, the sequence of shocks that have hit Kazakhstan can \nalso impact poverty and social vulnerability levels, and poverty rates could reach 11%\u201313%. Gender risks are also \nrecognizable. The several vulnerability dimensions of the current situation can be disaggregated by each of the three shocks:  \n \n(i) the COVID-19 outbreak could bring a hike in hospitalization and medication costs that can overwhelm the budgets of \nthe poor and most vulnerable, if infected. It also puts workers in health most at risk of coming into contact with infected \ncases (more than 70% of health workers are women);  \n(ii) the strict social lockdown measures and other Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) of the government are crucial \nto slowing-down the medical emergency. Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) are actions, apart from getting \nvaccinated and taking medicine, that people and communities can take to help slow the spread of illnesses (NPIs are \nalso known as community mitigation strategies). But these measures pose significant risks to the livelihoods and income-\ngeneration in very specific activities where women have a high degree of participation. Women account for more than \n65% of the labor force in some of the most affected sectors by the current lockdowns. Some hard-hit activities in the \ninformal labor market also include a significant share of women.  These could imply a potentially disproportionate impact \non women;  \n(iii) Women could also be disproportionally affected by a deep recession, given existing gender disparities in wage levels \nand unemployment rates, and already disadvantaged access to finance in normal times. \n \nf. The country\u2019s non-oil fiscal deficit as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020 is now set to widen to 11% \n(from 8% in 2019, and an originally expected 7% for 2020), also a result of the current discretionary countercyclical efforts \nand interrupt its downward trajectory (it was 10% in 2017). \n2. Countercyclical  a. The government has laid out a strong countercyclical fiscal response to mitigate the health, economic and social \nFiscal Response  impacts of the pandemic-related shocks that are now hitting Kazakhstan. Fiscal measures to mitigate the disruptions \ndevelopment  on business and employment have been targeted and gender-inclusive (including transfers to the vulnerable population and \nexpenditures  the potentially-most affected segments of the labor market, which includes women). Countercyclical response plans were \n(more generally, a  approved (including both tax and expenditure plans, and quasi-fiscal programs) to ensure financial stability and relaunch the \ncountercyclical  economic recovery), in addition to devising a safety-net to those that lose income. This is presented in detail in the \nfiscal response)c  Supplementary Document and in the main text. It is crucial to prevent firm bankruptcies, extended job losses, and financial \ninstability. The proposed ADB assistance will help the government mitigate the medical and economic impacts caused by \n ", "          Appendix 4  29 \ncoronavirus  disease  2019  (COVID-19)  pandemic  on  Kazakhstan,  supporting  its  immediate  COVID-19  Health  Policy \nResponse, measures to mitigate social distancing disruptions on businesses and employment; and countercyclical fiscal \nstimulus plans. The different measures are described in detail in the RRP and in the DMF. For example, in terms of social \nprotection and efforts to protect employment, here is what is already described in Table 4:  \n \n\u2022  Cash payments ($95\u2013$100 per month per person) for those who lost labor income under the state of emergency.a \nThe target is to reach 3 million people. All those that work in the informal labor market\u2014mostly women\u2014can apply. \nThis is implemented by the State Social Security Fund, and estimated to cost $877 million.  \n\u2022  A lower value-added tax rate was set for food,b and various other responses help mitigate the impact of higher food \nprices: a nationwide food supply program was quickly established and allocated T45.8 billion to local authorities to \nprovide free food sets to more than 1.1 million people (primarily elderly people, large families, and people with \ndisabilities, i.e., those registered in the social vulnerability ledger of the government). In parallel, the government \nintroduced price caps on essential foods. In sum, this initiative is estimated to cost $113 million. \n\u2022  To help vulnerable groups such as pensioners absorb the shock of a possible increase in food prices, the \ngovernment increased all social payments by 10%. This would include about 32,000 households currently covered \nby the unconditional cash transfer program, and 129,000 households covered by conditional cash aid under the \ngovernment\u2019s targeted social support. This implied an allocation of an additional $503 million. \n\u2022  In addition to significant utility subsidies and automatic reductions in the tax base, in March 2020, the government \nintroduced tax support measures targeting mainly micro and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in \nagriculture, trade, and services. This includes a reduction to zero in the rates of property tax (for retail, trade, \ncatering, entertainment, and hospitality businesses), land tax (for agricultural producers), and income tax (for \nindividual entrepreneurs). For SMEs in catering, lodging, transportation, consulting, and tourism, the government \nalso introduced a 6-month exemption from payroll taxes. The government deferred until 1 June 2020 all payments \nof taxes and other compulsory budget payments for SMEs, stopped enforcing the collection of overdue tax \nobligations, suspended the accrual of penalties for overdue tax obligations until August 2020, and extended tax \nreporting deadlines until September 2020. These are estimated to cost close to $5.68 billion. \n \nb. The planned fiscal response effort is not only sizable but also properly calibrated to target the segments of the population \nthat are most vulnerable to the current sequence of shocks and risks. It implies a stimulus of 8%\u20139% of GDP in 2020. This \npositive assessment is also shared by the IMF. As stated in the IMF Assessment Letter (Para 8), \u201cthe immediate priority is \nto mitigate the effect of the shocks on the economy. The authorities\u2019 anti-crisis package has the appropriate mix of \nmeasures and targeting to achieve this.\u201d In tables A4.1\u2013A4.2 below we present how the different initiatives fit within the \noverall fiscal stimulus package (split between on-budget and off-budget measures). All these measures are fiscal in nature, \nbut we refer to those that are off-budget as quasi-fiscal. The proposed Program captures them all, through three outputs:  \n \n(i)  Immediate COVID-19 Health Response Implemented (costing $338 million);  \n(ii)  Social Protection and Employment Protection Measures Implemented ($7.18 billion); and  \n(iii) Economic Stimulus Delivered ($5.97 billion). \n \n ", "30  Appendix 4 \nc. It is crucial for the intended objectives of the government response that the entire package is implemented in 2020, which \nwill imply about 8\u20139% of gross domestic product (GDP) in automatic and discretionary stimulus measures (a total of about \n$13 billion). This of course also includes the fiscal implications of the COVID-19 Health Sector and Social Risk Mitigation \nmeasures that were described above. All these measures are part of the package considered in the proposed logical \nframework for the ADB assistance. We also present here how the entire package of measures is divided between what is \nexplicitly reflected in the government budget on one-hand, and what is off-budget, in terms of initiatives that are not financed \nby the government budget directly. \n \nTable A4.1 \nNet Fiscal Response: $7.0 billion (4.6% of GDP), ON-BUDGET   \nAmount*  Purpose  Notes  Output \n$503 million   Social payments increase and social assistance  Pension, stipends and other payments   2 \n(equal to minimum wage) \n$682 million  Employment Roadmap program  Additional allocation from state budget  3 \n$239 million  Enbek and Auyl Besygi program (130,000 jobs)  Monotowns  and  rural  employment  stimulus  3 \n(microloans and grants) \n$306 million  Business Road Map and support for Agribusiness  Import substitution and manufacturing projects   3 \n$285 million  Epidemiological and other healthcare measures   Including  financial  stimulus  for  healthcare  1 \nworkers  \n$53.4 million  Procurement of supplies, including personal  For use at both central and regionals levels  1 \nprotective gears, disinfectants and medicines, and \nmedical devices  \n$4.6 billion   Compensation  of  the  budget  losses  (including  Includes compensation for tax expenditures, tax  3 \ntaxes, republican and local)  losses and exchange rate losses  \n$1.09 billion  Other  outright  expenses  (including  utility  bills     2 \nsubsidies) \n$113 million  Food distribution  The significant costs of reduction in food- 2 \nrelated taxes are not counted here \nTotal: $7.9 billion  After deductions from and cancellations of original state expenditure plans of around $0.9 billion: \n(5.2% of GDP)  Total new tax and expenditure plans: $7.0 billion \nNote: All amounts are in KZT at the exchange rate of KZT440 per USD. \nSource: Ministry of Finance.  \n \nTable A4.2 \nQuasi-Fiscal Expenditures: $5.6 billion (3.7% of GDP), OFF-BUDGET   \nAmount*  Purpose  Notes  Output \n$1.59 billion  Employment Roadmap program, off-budget resource  Aims to create 250,000 jobs through project  3 \nmobilization by Baiterek Holding (SOE)  financing sourced from local bond issuances \n ", "          Appendix 4  31 \n$877 million  Monthly social assistance of $100 to workers who  Financed from existing savings of the State  2 \nlost jobs due to the State of Emergency  Social Security Fund (off-budget fund) \n$2.27 billion   \u2018Economy of Simple Things\u2019 program and working  6% interest rate on loans and 8% for working  3 \ncapital finance from NBK to SMEs  capital financed by NBK \n$886 million  Financing construction of affordable housing   Financed  through  municipal  bonds  in  16  3 \nregions \nNote: All amounts are in KZT at the exchange rate of KZT440 per USD. \nSource: Ministry of Finance. \n \nd. As head of the State Commission on the State of Emergency, the President of Kazakhstan has taken leadership for the \npublic announcement of measures, in complement to the approved decrees. The sequence of decisions and announcements \nis presented here as a way of formalizing the list of official sources for what is presented above: \n \n(i)  On March 15, a decree was approved \u2018On introduction of state of emergency\u2019: \nhttp://www.akorda.kz/ru/legal_acts/decrees/o-vvedenii-chrezvychainogo-polozheniya-v-respublike-kazahstan.  \n(ii)  On March 16, the state of emergency was announced: \nhttp://www.akorda.kz/ru/speeches/internal_political_affairs/in_speeches_and_addresses/televizionnoe-\nobrashchenie-glavy-gosudarstva-kasym-zhomarta-tokaeva. \n(iii)  On March 16, a decree was approved \u2018On measures for ensuring socio-economic stability\u2019: \nhttp://www.akorda.kz/ru/legal_acts/decrees/o-merah-po-obespecheniyu-socialno-ekonomicheskoi-stabilnosti.  \n(iv)  Also on March 16, another decree was approved \u2018On further measures for stabilizing the economy\u2019: \nhttp://www.akorda.kz/ru/legal_acts/decrees/o-dalneishih-merah-po-stabilizacii-ekonomiki.  \n(v)  On March 23, all these instructions to government were made public: \nhttp://www.akorda.kz/ru/speeches/internal_political_affairs/in_speeches_and_addresses/vystuplenie-prezidenta-\nkasym-zhomarta-tokaeva-na-zasedanii-gosudarstvennoi-komissii-po-chrezvychainomu-polozheniyu.  \n(vi)  On March 31, all the anti-crisis measures were re-stated during a public update on the COVID-19 situation: \nhttp://www.akorda.kz/ru/speeches/internal_political_affairs/in_statements_and_congratulations/zayavlenie-glavy-\ngosudarstva-kasym-zhomarta-tokaeva.  \n(vii)  On April 10, a first report to the State Commission on the State of Emergency was delivered: \nhttp://www.akorda.kz/ru/speeches/internal_political_affairs/in_speeches_and_addresses/vystuplenie-glavy-\ngosudarstva-na-zasedanii-gosudarstvennoi-komissii-po-chrezvychainomu-polozheniyu.  \n(viii)  On April 14, a decree extending the state of emergency was approved: \nhttp://www.akorda.kz/ru/legal_acts/decrees/o-prodlenii-deistviya-chrezvychainogo-polozheniya-v-respublike-\nkazahstan.  \n(ix)  On April 21, in complement to the decree \u2018On measures for ensuring socio-economic stability\u2019, additional \nmeasures were approved: http://www.akorda.kz/ru/legal_acts/decrees/o-nekotoryh-merah-po-stabilizacii-\nekonomiki.  \n(x)  On April 29, a new decree extended the state of emergency: http://www.akorda.kz/ru/legal_acts/decrees/o-\nprodlenii-deistviya-chrezvychainogo-polozheniya-v-respublike-kazahstan-1.  \n ", "32  Appendix 4 \n(xi)  On May 11, the President of Kazakhstan announced, at the final meeting of Commission on the State of \nEmergency, that the State of Emergency was finished, and that the State Commission was reorganized into a \nCommission for restoring economic growth. Some measures for promoting economic recovery were also \nannounced: http://www.akorda.kz/ru/speeches/internal_political_affairs/in_speeches_and_addresses/vystuplenie-\nglavy-gosudarstva-na-zaklyuchitelnom-zasedanii-gosudarstvennoi-komissii-po-chrezvychainomu-polozheniyu.  \n(xii)  On May 19, a comprehensive economic recovery plan for measures until the end 2020 was adopted by the \ngovernment: https://online.zakon.kz/Document/?doc_id=39292197#pos=416;-35 . It was also announced on the \nsame day: https://primeminister.kz/ru/news/pravitelstvo-prinyalo-kompleksnyy-plan-po-vosstanovleniyu-\n  ekonomicheskogo-rosta-194594 .  \n3. Pre-shock  a. Growth was relatively strong in early 2020 \u2014above 4%\u2014 and the macroeconomic outlook for 2020-22 was in line with the \nRecord of Sound  good performance of recent years: growth projections were of about 4% on average on the back of a projected continuation \nMacroeconomic  of strong growth in the Kazakhstan non-oil economy. As generally observed by different institutions and the ADB team (and \nManagementd  explicitly stated in the IMF Assessment Letter), Kazakhstan\u2019s macroeconomic management prior to the shock had been \ngenerally sound and the country\u2019s growth performance had been strong. \n \nb. Kazakhstan\u2019s new monetary regime has served its macroeconomic management well, with stable inflation (within the 4\u20136 \npercent band of the inflation target) and added exchange-rate flexibility. The NBK improved its systemic liquidity management \nand interest rate transmission mechanism, and it remains committed to developing it further. This is a priority to help monetary \npolicy\u2019s traction over credit conditions in the economy and dedollarization. \n \nc. Kazakhstan\u2019s fiscal management had been credible before the crisis, and with the non-oil fiscal deficit (and the cyclically-\nadjusted non-oil deficit) on a downward trajectory and with sustainable levels of public debt. Kazakhstan has substantial fiscal \nspace and sustainable levels of public debt, and the planned use of buffers in the current juncture is fully justified. As assessed \nby the ADB team and confirmed by IMF analysis (IMF Assessment Letter), Kazakhstan\u2019s public sector debt will remain \ncomfortably sustainable for the foreseeable future, and the current countercyclical fiscal effort is making a very appropriate \nand much needed use of the available fiscal space. Public finances are this expected to remain sound, as also shown by \nprojections of fiscal balances in relation to the economy\u2019s cyclical position: the planned adjustments in the primary deficit are \nproperly calibrated to continue supporting growth while dampening the growth of Gross Public Debt Ratio. \n \nd. The sound pre-shock sound macroeconomic management record of the government has now been instrumental in \nprojecting credibility to its recent monetary and macroprudential policy decisions in banking and exchange-rate markets. The \nlatter have been very effective at managing key trade-offs: in early March, the NBK raised its policy rate and intervened for a \ntime to stabilize the foreign exchange (FX) market (interventions were intended to avoid disruptive corrections and did not \ntarget any particular level of the exchange rate), but it has since adjusted its policy rate given emerging weaknesses in \naggregate demand (while keeping some controls on to limit speculative FX trading). The tenge initially depreciated by about \n18 percent; it has stabilized and regained some of its value recently.  \n \ne. Kazakhstan\u2019s PFM systems are reliable and well-tested. This will be Kazakhstan\u2019s 3rd ADB CSF, which will also benefit \nfrom an overall sound institutional budgetary framework. In 2018, a Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) \nreport on Kazakhstane highlighted many of the same strengths as the ADB Governance Risk Assessmentf that had been \n ", "          Appendix 4  33 \ncompleted a few months earlier, which were: budget reliability, public debt management, policy-based fiscal strategy and \nbudgeting in general and legislative scrutiny of budgets in particular, predictability and control in budget execution in general \nand internal controls and audit in particular, accounting and reporting in general, as well as external scrutiny and audit. The \nweaknesses that were also identified have been important areas of ongoing improvement as well.  \n \nd. As assessed by the ADB team and confirmed by IMF analysis (IMF Assessment Letter), Kazakhstan\u2019s public sector debt \nwill remain comfortably sustainable for the foreseeable future, and the current countercyclical fiscal effort is making a very \na ppropriate and much needed use of the available fiscal space. \n4. Structural  a. The government implemented a robust response to control the spread of the COVID-19 and provide urgent medical support \nreforms (in the  to affected population. The government has collaborated closely with the WHO, UN agencies and international development \ncase of the CPRO:  partners to strengthen the health response.   \nhealth sector   \nresponse to  b. The authorities: (i) initiated readiness preparations in early-January, i.e. more than 2-months before the first COVID case \nCOVID-19  in Kazakhstan, (ii) immediately built-up the capacity of the health-care system to cope with worst-case hospitalization \nepidemic) g  scenarios; and (iii) announced a 30-day state of emergency from 16 March onwards (first cases reported on 13 March), now \nextended; with a series of other strict quarantine and social lockdown measures. All these are extensively described in the \nSupplementary Document, and summarized in the main text of this RRP and here: \n\u2022  Early Pre-COVID-19 Readiness and Public Health Response Measures. The Government of Kazakhstan started \npreparations well ahead of infection breakout in the country and undertook a set of swift and decisive containment, \nhealthcare and other social  measures in response to COVID-19. This was done  in close coordination with \ndevelopment partners and governments of neighboring countries. On 6 January 2020 the Ministry of Healthcare \n(MoH) approved the main preparedness activities to mitigate epidemiological outbreaks. International travelers \ndepending on the country of origin placed under the fourteen days mandatory isolation of self-quarantine.h All \ntransportation between Kazakhstan and countries highly affected by COVID-19 has been suspended since 3 \nFebruary 2020. Screening points on entry and medical monitoring of those coming to Kazakhstan from countries \naffected by COVID-19 was established. MOH approved the COVID-19 infection treatments clinic protocol in early \nFebruary.i During February\u2013March 2020, the government prepared 27,000 beds (28% of total hospital beds in the \ncountry) for hospitalization of COVID-19 patients and contact persons, including 182 resuscitation beds with \nappropriate equipment (mechanical ventilation devices and monitors, etc.). MOH also mobilized more than 10 \nthousand medical workers to provide COVID-related medical care and has reserved additional reserve of 802 trained \nspecialists for standby deployment. \n\u2022  Medical and Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions upon the outbreak of COVID-19. On 13 March 2020, the first \nimported cases were detected, confirmed, all immediately isolated and treated. Initial infections were spread in Nur-\nSultan (the capital city) and Almaty (the largest city) and all contacts were quarantined and tested. As an immediate \nreaction, the Emergency Operations Center (EOC) was established by the government and the EOC started \nmonitoring (on a 24 hours basis) COVID-19 situation globally, regionally, and on the country level. The EOC also \ncollected information on how many persons arrived from affected countries, and those that arrived from highly \naffected countries were placed on 14-day quarantine.j Following the announcement of COVID-19 as a pandemic, the \n ", "34  Appendix 4 \nstate of emergency was declared and still remains in place to date.k The government deployed regional response \nteams, consisting of local government, healthcare, social care, civil society, and private sector representatives to \nidentify corresponding needs, support vulnerable groups, establish feedback mechanism and monitor response \ntransmission. Dedicated ambulatory teams were assigned in every region to provide care and transport of suspected \nand confirmed COVID-19 case to designated hospitals. The National Reference Laboratory in Almaty received test \nkits from Russia, PRC, and WHO in March, and jointly with the National Biotechnology Center started to develop own \ntesting systems. On 6 April, the country received additional 250,000 tests and ordered an additional 300,000. To \ndate, no other DMC in Asia tests more in per capita terms than Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan has intensified its \nsurveillance by enhancing capacity of active case finding.l The EOC developed a geographic information system \n(GIS) tools to conduct monitoring of COVID-19 spread.m MOH with assistance of development partners conducting \ncontinuous procurement of additional stockpiles to ensure the availability of essential medical disposables and \nequipment in the designated healthcare facilities. Overall, the government allocated $53.4 million for procurement of \nsupplies, including for the procurement personal protective gears, disinfectants and medicines and medical devices \non a central and regional level. In March 2020, the government has announced plans to allocate additional $285 \nmillion to enhance the capacity of the healthcare system (these $285 million are also for anti-epidemiological \nmeasures such as, e.g., payment of bonuses to doctors and other employees, grocery and household packages, \ncommunication services; the total of T125.2 billion includes T40.6 billion for premiums to doctors in the front line, \nT19.5 billion for payment to medical organizations, T14.8 billion for the preparation of three medical complexes, T30.8 \nmillion for food and household sets, T8.1 billion for premiums to employees and medical workers of law enforcement \nbodies as well as military personnel of the National Guard, T4.1 billion for communication services, and T5.6 billion \nforensic medical examination). Three new fully-equipped medical complexes were set-up in record time. In terms of \ndirect healthcare support, the government immediately extended access of uninsured citizens to receive full medical \ncare until 1 July 2020. Appropriate public communication has also been established.n   \nc. The government\u2019s health readiness plans are comprehensive, are being fully Implemented, and are perceived to have been \neffective at keeping the medical emergency under control so far, in terms of capacity to cope with current and worse \nhospitalization scenarios. As publicly stated by the WHO Regional Director on May 13, 2020,o the Kazakhstan experience \nis a great example of proactive efforts to stabilize the COVID-19 situation, with strong surveillance, extensive testing, including \nHealth  Workers,  digitalized  data  collection,  timely  prevention  &  intensified  contact  tracing,  and  of  treating  patients \nappropriately. But the situation remains dangerous, and the authorities remain ready to deploy additional measures. \n  \n5. Debt  a. Kazakhstan\u2019s public sector debt will remain comfortably sustainable for the foreseeable future. The current fiscal effort is \nsustainabilityp  making a very appropriate and much needed use of the available fiscal space. Kazakhstan public sector remains a net creditor \nat this stage, and its projected debt levels are expected to remain sustainable for the foreseeable future (and projected to rise \nto 29-31% by 2025). See the debt sustainability analysis (DSA) conducted by ADB in early-May 2020. The fundamental \nconclusions of the exercises presented in the DSA are very much in line with the following key statements in the IMF \nAssessment Letter: \u201cWith consolidation over the medium-term, public debt is projected to rise moderately\u2014from 20 percent \nof GDP in 2019 to 29 percent in 2025. Debt remains sustainable, and buffers are expected to remain strong\u2014at around 30 \npercent of GDP, in line with the threshold under the authorities\u2019 fiscal rules (Para 8)\u201d. \n \n ", "          Appendix 4  35 \nb. The current fiscal effort is making a very appropriate and much needed use of the available fiscal space. Kazakhstan public \nsector remains a net creditor at this stage, and its projected debt levels are expected to remain sustainable for the foreseeable \nfuture (29% by 2025).  \nc. Borrowing from ADBq (and from any other source of concessional finance) will have a minimal (or negligible) but still \nbeneficial impact on debt-to-GDP ratio going forward (and therefore on debt sustainability). This is implicit in the comparison \nwith the counterfactual scenario (on which a DSA is normally and conservatively based on, implicitly) in which deficit-financing \nwas were to be done on market-based pricing terms (even if not available in 2020). Sovereign interest rates on the 10-year \nbonds issued in tenge have increased by about 10% since the beginning of March; likewise, the value of the associated credit \ndefault swaps (CDS) has increased by about 40%. Any concessional financing will have a positive impact on Kazakhstan\u2019s \nprojected gross debt levels, as the latter are predicated on market-based borrowing terms. \nd. Large tapping of the NFRK to finance the crisis response is not expected to affect the target of 30% GDP by 2025, a \nthreshold in Kazakhstan\u2019s fiscal rules and still a significant buffer. Thus, the Kazakhstan government is expected to remain \nan external new creditor till 2024\u20132025 at least. See the debt sustainability analysis (DSA) conducted by ADB in early-May \n2020. \ne. International foreign-exchange reserves are projected to continue at import coverage ratios above 6\u20136.5, which is both \nsizable and fully adequate to address external debt financing issues and episodes of exchange-rate pressure.   \n6. Coordination   a. ADB keeps consulting with IMF and discusses macroeconomic forecasts, emerging risks to the macroeconomic and fiscal \nwith the IMFr  outlook, and the assumptions that underpin projected impact of the government\u2019s countercyclical fiscal (and quasi-fiscal) \nstimulus efforts. The World Bank (WB) also holds frequent discussions with ADB on these issues, and the frequency of these \nhave increased with the COVID-19 pandemic. ADB and IMF agree with the appropriateness of government\u2019s countercyclical \nresponse to the current crisis. IMF has updated its DSA for ADB benefit after its recent informal consultations with the \ngovernment (post Article IV report), and discussions took place on its assumptions. This work is the basis for the forecasts in \nthe IMF Assessment Letter.  \n \nb. IMF has also provided an its Assessment Letter to ADB in April 2020, which also describes states, amongst other issues, \nits support for the government\u2019s anti-crisis measures as an appropriate and well-calibrated use of available fiscal space. It \nalso describes the constructive consultations between the IMF and with the Government of Kazakhstan. As follows. \u201cArticle \nIV consultations are conducted annually, and Kazakhstan receives technical assistance (TA) from the IMF. Relations with \nKazakhstan continue to be characterized by a fruitful policy dialogue, and recent TA has focused on monetary operations, \nrevenue administration, public financial management, and statistics. The last Article IV consultation was concluded on \nJanuary 27, 2020 and the staff report was published shortly thereafter (IMF Country Report No. 20/32). The report noted that \nthe authorities\u2019 track record of macroeconomic management prior to the shock had been generally sound and that growth \nperformance had been strong, in an often-challenging environment. It noted that further work is needed to step up structural \nreforms and diversification and to improve governance.\u201d Although the IMF is not involved in the financing side of the \ngovernment\u2019s countercyclical support efforts,s it is currently actively engaged with the government across all the key areas \nrelated to macroeconomic surveillance and fiscal risks, financial sector stability, and also on-going work in financial \ns upervision and monitory policy efforts.   \n ", "36  Appendix 4 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, CSF = countercyclical support facility, DSA = debt sustainability analysis, GDP = gross domestic product, IMF = \nInternational Monetary Fund, NBK = National Bank of Kazakhstan, NFRK = National Fund of the Republic of Kazakhstan, NPI = Non-Pharmaceutical \nInterventions, OECD = Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, PFM = public financial management. \na  This sub-criteria reads as: \u201c(\u2026) In the case of the CPRO, the DMC should demonstrate that, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, it has experienced, or is likely to \nexperience: (i) a severe decline in growth; and (ii) fiscal and financial sector stress.

Kazakhstan Republic: Country Governance Risk Assessment. Manila. ADB completed a governance risk assessment (GRA) in 2017 according to the \nimplementation guidelines of ADB\u2019s Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan. The assessment had already concluded in 2017 Kazakhstan had made good \nprogress in building institutions to manage fiscal revenues and expenses and in strengthening country systems in PFM, public procurement and combating corruption \nwith due consideration of the checks and balances between the executive and other branches of the government. \ng   This sub-criteria reads as: \u201c(\u2026) In the case of the CPRO in place of the emphasis on structural reforms, the DMC should demonstrate that credible and proactive \nsteps are being taken to address the spread of COVID-19 and mitigate its economic impacts on the population, particularly on poor and vulnerable groups. The DMC\u2019s \nCOVID-19 pandemic response plan may include a wide range of measures to address the public health or economic impacts of the pandemic. Where relevant, \nreference may also be made to medium and longer-term public health and preventative measures that the DMC plans to adopt, particularly those which are intended \nto receive support from conventional PBL\u201d. \nh  An Inter-sectoral Committee on COVID-19 chaired by the Deputy Prime-Minister was established to ensure full coordination and an action plan was approved on 29 \nJanuary 2020 for immediate implementation. \nI    The protocol is continuously discussed with leading international specialists and updated to reflect the latest developments on diagnostics and treatment of coronavirus \ninfection. MoH with the support of WHO and the involvement of national stakeholders continues to identify main areas of improvement in the overall response. \nj   Those coming from other affected countries were putted under medical monitoring via primary health care centers. \nk   All places of mass gatherings were closed, public events were cancelled, large family commemorative events have been banned. Stringent enforcement measures \naimed at preventing the spread of the disease, such as penalties for persons evading medical examinations, have been applied. A declaration of quarantine and \nlockdown was announced on 17 March 2020 for the country\u2019s three largest cities, and subsequently introduced in other regions. \nl    Currently MoH with the support of WHO continues to improve the system for contact tracing and monitoring. \nm  The Biosafety Research Institute (BIR) jointly with the National Center for Biotechnology announced a start of coronavirus vaccine research and development in \nKazakhstan. BIR has a formal agreement with WHO for this work. \nn  A hotline was established for medical professionals and the general population. Information on the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, and measures of the individual \nprotection,  is  circulated  through  various  means  including  daily  briefings  on  TV,  radio  and  social  media  (Facebook,  Telegram  and  etc.).

International reserves \nare determined to be adequate, taking into account the imports coverage ratio and the short-term external debt financing requirement. Relevant indicators may be \nbased on the debt sustainability analysis by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, or a similar assessment when such a joint analysis is not \n ", "          Appendix 4  37 \nconducted. In the case of the CPRO, the expansion of eligibility to include group A DMCs means that many will be at high or moderate risk of debt distress. To be \neligible for CPRO support, all DMCs must be able to demonstrate that the assistance provided by ADB will be integrated into a fiscal framework that does not \njeopardize the borrower\u2019s debt sustainability or exacerbate weaknesses in fiscal sustainability. Specific reference should be made to the size of the CPRO assistance \nrelative to the borrower\u2019s debt sustainability. Reference to support being received from other development partners should also be made. \nq   The proposed CPRO assistance to Kazakhstan will constitute less than 3% of the country\u2019s gross public debt by end-2020, and 0.6% of GDP. \nr  This sub-criteria reads as: \u201cIf the IMF is not involved in crisis response, ADB will ensure that the country has had constructive consultations with the IMF, such as \nrecently completed or ongoing Article IV consultations.  For both CSF and CPRO, ADB should secure an assessment letter from the IMF confirming the soundness \nof the government\u2019s macroeconomic management and other policies before the Board of Directors considers the proposed assistance. ADB should work closely with \nits counterparts at the IMF to determine that the CSF or CPRO and any related conventional PBL are appropriate, despite the absence of an IMF program.\u201d \ns   By law, the Government of Kazakhstan is not allowed to seek IMF fiscal financing (budget support). By law, the Government of Kazakhstan can only seek budget \nsupport from development institutions like ADB or WB. By law, IMF financing can only be sought by the NBK (as the issuer of liabilities), which would probably only \noccur for balance-of-payments stress reasons. As stated above, Kazakhstan foreign-exchange reserves are projected to continue at import coverage ratios above 6-\n6.5, which is both sizable and fully adequate to address external debt financing issues or episodes of exchange-rate pressure. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n "], "metadata": {"ADBContentGroup": "2;#CWRD|6d71ff58-4882-4388-ab5c-218969b1e9c8", "ADBCountry": "", "ADBCountryDocumentType": "", "ADBDepartmentOwner": "18;#SEC|0251849c-5d26-4413-ade9-2e3ee268b27b", "ADBDivision": "4;#CWPF|14fb442e-d1a4-4c70-b930-46052dddc16a", "ADBDocumentLanguage": "1;#English|16ac8743-31bb-43f8-9a73-533a041667d6", "ADBDocumentSecurity": "", "ADBDocumentType": "6;#Templates|c97063a1-ad03-4324-beaa-bf7c225b0bba", "ADBDocumentTypeValue": "ADB Document", "ADBProject": "", "ADBProjectDocumentType": "", "ADBSector": "", "ADBSubRegion": "", "Author": "Asian Development Bank", "AuthorIds_UIVersion_1536": "110", "AuthorIds_UIVersion_2048": "109", "Comments": "", "Company": "Licenced User", "ContentTypeId": "0x010100ECA6AC2EA9E9A4448B9434B3A99D2FDA", "CreationDate": "D:20200618124143+08'00'", "Creator": "Acrobat PDFMaker 17 for Word", "Keywords": "kazakhstan, covid-19, coronavirus, pandemic, covid-19 response, countercyclical support facility, cares program, public health, 54188-001, loan  3941, adb project, terms and conditions, board approval, approved projects, recommendations of the president", "ModDate": "D:20200626133106+08'00'", "Producer": "Adobe PDF Library 15.0", "Segment": "", "SourceModified": "D:20200618043039", "Subject": "The proposed assistance will help the government mitigate the medical, social and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on Kazakhstan, by supporting its (i) immediate COVID-19 health policy response, (ii) social protection and employment protection measures, and (iii) overall stimulus measures\r\rThe report and recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors (RRP) document describes the terms and conditions of a project for consideration and approval by ADB's Board of Directors.\r\rThis document dated June 2020 is provided for the ADB project 54188-001 in Kazakhstan.", "TaxCatchAll": "18;#SEC|0251849c-5d26-4413-ade9-2e3ee268b27b;#2;#CWRD|6d71ff58-4882-4388-ab5c-218969b1e9c8;#1;#English|16ac8743-31bb-43f8-9a73-533a041667d6;#4;#CWPF|14fb442e-d1a4-4c70-b930-46052dddc16a", "Title": "COVID-19 Active Response and Expenditure Support Program: Report and Recommendation of the President", "a0d1b14b197747dfafc19f70ff45d4f6": "", "a37ff23a602146d4934a49238d370ca5": "Templates|c97063a1-ad03-4324-beaa-bf7c225b0bba", "d01a0ce1b141461dbfb235a3ab729a2c": "", "d61536b25a8a4fedb48bb564279be82a": "SEC|0251849c-5d26-4413-ade9-2e3ee268b27b", "de77c5b4d20d4bdeb0b6d09350193e53": "", "h00e4aaaf4624e24a7df7f06faa038c6": "English|16ac8743-31bb-43f8-9a73-533a041667d6", "h35d3bd3f16b4964a022bfaedf90233f": "", "hca2169e3b0945318411f30479ba40c8": "", "ia017ac09b1942648b563fe0b2b14d52": "CWPF|14fb442e-d1a4-4c70-b930-46052dddc16a", "k985dbdc596c44d7acaf8184f33920f0": "", "kc098dd651dc4f4b9248417ab8ccab6f": "", "p030e467f78f45b4ae8f7e2c17ea4d82": ""}, "author_page": "Vice-President  Shixin Chen, Operations 1 \nDirector General  Werner E.
