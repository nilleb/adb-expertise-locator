THE ENSUING PROJECT \n \n1.  The  Government  of  Mongolia,  during  the  country  programming  mission  held  in \nUlaanbaatar in April 2018, requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide lending \nsupport to prepare the Climate-Resilient and Sustainable Livestock Development Project. The \nensuing loan is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for Mongolia for 2019\u20132021 \nand the proposed transaction technical assistance (TA) is included in ADB\u2019s nonlending pipeline \nfor 2019.1 \n  \n2.  The  livestock  subsector  remains  a  key  driver  of  agricultural  output  in  Mongolia, \ncontributing  84.2%  of  total  agricultural  output  and  employing  nearly  a  third  of  Mongolia\u2019s \neconomically active population. Despite the significant importance of the livestock subsector, \nseveral constraints and risks threaten the sustainable development of the sector as well as its \nability to access new export markets that are vital for lifting rural populations out of poverty. Lack \nof concerted and coordinated policy efforts have resulted in unsustainable livestock numbers and \nsignificant rangeland degradation. Poor livestock, water and pasture management is contributing \nto the problem where 70.0% of Mongolia\u2019s pastureland is now degraded. Additionally, various \nchallenges throughout the meat and dairy value chain including frequent disease outbreaks, poor \nveterinary and breeding services, low quality of meat due to limited use of balanced nutrition and \nbreeding practices, and limited linkages between herder groups and competitive markets has \nconstrained the export potential of Mongolia\u2019s livestock sector.  \n \n3.  The project aims to improve the efficiency and sustainability of climate-resilient livestock \nproduction systems by encouraging policy-level changes, improving livestock, pasture, and water \nmanagement, and strengthening local meat and dairy value chains. The project will: (i) enhance \nthe livestock sector policy, regulatory framework, and capacity; (ii) improve climate resilience of \nlivestock, pasture, and water management; and (iii) strengthen meat and dairy value chains.  \n \n4.  The ensuing project is estimated to cost $30.3 million. ADB is requested to provide $30.0 \nmillion through a loan largely for new investments and capacity building. The government will \nprovide in-kind contribution equivalent to $0.3 million.  \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n5.  The executing agency, the Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Light Industry (MOFALI), has \nlimited experience with ADB requirements for loan preparation. The transaction TA will help the \ngovernment prepare a project design that complies with the ADB requirements and international \nbest practice.2 The TA will undertake the relevant work, tasks and due diligence for assessing \nboth the technical, economic and financial feasibility of the project as well as the environmental \nand social impacts of the project.  \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n6.  The major outputs and activities are summarized in Table 1.  \n \n \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2018.

Cost and Financing \n \n7.  The TA is estimated to cost $0.825 million, of which $0.75 million will be financed on a \ngrant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-6). The key expenditure items \nare listed in Appendix 1. \n \n8.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office \nspace for consultants, domestic transport, data collection, logistic support in arranging workshops \nand field visits, and other in-kind contributions. The government was informed that approval of \nthe TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n9.  ADB will administer the TA. A multisector steering committee, chaired by the MOFALI \nState Secretary and including representatives from the aimag and central agencies, will guide the \nproject. A project implementation unit will be established at MOFALI to coordinate and implement \nthe project. The TA will be implemented over 11 months, tentatively from August 2019 to July \n2020. Equipment for the TA consultants will be procured following ADB Procurement Policy (2017, \nas  amended  from  time  to  time),  and  handed  over  to  MOFALI  upon  the  TA  completion. \nDisbursement under the TA will be in line with ADB\u2019s  Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). MOFALI will provide office space for consultants \nfor the TA.  \n \n10.
