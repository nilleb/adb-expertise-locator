Agriculture in South Asia and Southeast Asia is dominated by small farms, many of which \noperate at subsistence levels and are exposed to inefficient, government-run marketing schemes \nand local markets dominated by intermediaries. Supply chains organized by private off-takers and \ncompanies that purchase and process agricultural produce as buyers for national and global \nmarkets have been increasingly identified as an interesting alternative to farmers as effective \nintermediary mechanisms. The alignment of buyer and farmer interests can enhance productivity \nand quality and, thus, effectively connect farmers to growing markets and improve their income \non a sustainable basis. \n \n2.  Commercially viable approaches that enhance the livelihoods of small farmers and provide \nincome  and  employment  opportunities  require  significant  capital  investment.  Accessing \ncommercial bank or nonbank financing with appropriate risk participation of farmers, agribusiness, \nand financiers, each maximizing their risk management, is crucial to facilitating the integration of \nfarmers into the agriculture value chain. The technical assistance (TA) aims to identify viable and \nsustainable models across South Asia and Southeast Asia and different crop contexts, as well as \nbuild partnerships among qualified financial institutions (QFIs), qualified agribusiness companies \n(QACs), and farmers.1 The TA will pilot several approaches that appear scalable and have the \npotential to be replicated across South Asia and Southeast Asia by leveraging investment \nstructures and successfully tested pilots. Key partners include \n(i)  QFIs including banks and nonbank financial institutions with exposure to the rural \neconomy; and \n(ii)  QACs acting as buyers, off-takers, processors, and aggregators of primary and \nprocessed agricultural products. \n \n3.  Both QFIs and QACs must be prepared to provide funding to small farmers with access \nto arable landholdings and integrate farm communities in the solution. The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  Private market driven initiatives that link farmers with markets can be more cost-effective \nand efficient than government schemes that lack market incentives.2 If small-scale farmers are to \njoin private initiatives, they must understand the requirements and standards of the private market \nparticipants.  Demand-driven  approaches  allow  farmers  to  better  understand  market \nrequirements, make better decisions on land allocation for specific crops, and meet product \nquality expectations. With the help of QAC services and QFI credit, farmers can boost yields and \nincrease the resulting net income on different crops. However, small farmers currently face \nnumerous challenges that limit their ability to integrate into agriculture value chains, including \n \n(i)  low productivity and product quality associated with high unit cost due to costly \ninputs, inappropriate application of pesticides and/or herbicides, and crop losses; \n(ii)  inadequate or costly finance for funding working capital and capital expenditure \nrequirements due to traditional lending processes that require documentation, \nincluding collateral, that many farmers cannot provide; and \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of the Asian Development Bank\u2019s website on 1 August \n2014. \n2 Global Harvest Initiative. 2014. Global Agricultural Productivity Report. Washington, DC. \n ", "2 \n \n(iii)  intermediaries that take advantage of their market position by charging exorbitant \nfees in marketing the produce downstream, thus substantially siphoning off small \nfarmers\u2019 producer surplus. \n \n5.  Some private agribusinesses recognize that the predominantly small farmers require a \nhand-holding approach that extends farm services to address low productivity and market power. \nIf well-structured and commercially viable, such an approach may substantially enhance small \nfarmers\u2019 livelihoods and income and employment opportunities. The typical models aggregate \nsmall farmers and impart advisory services within a rural community, and gradually increase the \nnumber of capable small farmers in the scheme. Agribusiness companies typically advise and \nstandardize land preparation and the application of climate-resilient seed varieties, fertilizer, and \nwater-efficient technologies through their field services, and buy the produce. This controlled \napproach introduces sustainable farming practices that can substantially strengthen the market \nvalue of the participating small farmer\u2019s production and income. \n \n6.  Traditionally, financial institutions\u2019 lending to agriculture is undermined by the perceived \nhigh risks involved in agricultural production, which include climatic risks, calamities through \nadverse weather, variance in rainfall, poor farm practices, and farmers\u2019 behavior including loan \ndefault and side selling. Adverse impacts of climate change can add to these risks over time. In \naddition, the branch network of financial institutions does not usually extend to the villages where \nfarmers operate and, hence, have less potential to identify and address problems early on. Also, \nlending processes usually require property documentation that cannot be produced by farmers. \nAs a result,  lending to agriculture is usually far below its potential. \n \n7.  The  off-taker  and  contract  farming  arrangements  may  become  part  of  tripartite \nagreements with financial institutions, and these can substantially reduce the farm credit risk. \nUnder such an arrangement, an off-taker agrees to purchase the farmer\u2019s produce, thus directly \nmaking the due credit reimbursement to  financial institution, while the farmer agrees to sell the \nproduce to the off-taker and agrees to the direct debt payment mechanism. The risk profile further \nimproves when the off-taker agrees to take a portion of the credit risk against its advantage of \nbeing able to select well-performing farmers and closely monitor their activities on the ground. \nBecause of the improved risk profile, banks may be able to offer attractive market lending rates \nto the farmer, thus making credit more affordable. As such approaches are still being pilot tested, \nfew farmers currently benefit from such credit schemes. However, the collaboration of commercial \nlenders  and agribusiness companies with farmer communities can be beneficial if the specific \nrisks are properly identified and allocated to the party that is best able to manage them. \n \n8.  A World Bank paper indicates that improved farm credit can improve farm productivity, \npointing to the association between credit and yield improvements through improved equipment, \nfertilizer, and tractor use leading to income improvements.3 As partnerships between financial \ninstitutions, agribusinesses, and farmers are still in the early stages, it is necessary to broaden \nthe experience and develop scalable projects by identifying willing parties. This approach must \nbe customized and field tested for different commodities, countries, crop cycles, climates, and \nland tenure conditions. \n \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n                                                \n3  World Bank. 2006.

Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The impact will be that scalable models for commercial credit to small farmers via contract \nfarming and product aggregation are established. The outcome will be that two successfully tested \npilot projects lead to higher farm household incomes. The output is that scalable farm credit to \nsmall farmers in collaboration with QFIs and QACs is appropriately structured. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The TA will be implemented in three phases. \n \n11.  Phase 1: Partner identification. Following a brief desk research to understand good \ninternational practice of managing tripartite relationships in agriculture, ADB will map potential \nQFIs, QACs, and relevant farm communities and potential pilot projects by crops. QACs and QFIs \nmust be well-positioned to screen pilot project opportunities based on their existing operations, \nknowledge of demand for commodities, and strong rural and agribusiness client relationships. \nThe selection process will be carried out by ADB and look for the highest value addition of pilot \nprojects and committed QFIs and QACs willing to provide high benefits to participating small \nfarmers. The identification of QACs also requires that the Asian Development Bank (ADB) is \nsatisfied with their integrity; financial situation taking into account the quality of assets, solvency, \nliquidity, and profitability; as well as the QACs\u2019 top management commitment to \n \n(i)  integrating existing and future business operations to pilot farm communities; \n(ii)  establishing commercial farm risk management structures that enable farmers to \ninvest with longevity; \n(iii)  establishing good environmental, social, and governance safeguard practices \nincluding  pursuing  genuine  social  responsibility  and  imparting  good  farming \npractices to rural communities; \n(iv)  putting in place a project team and agreeing to share risks and TA cost; and \n(v)  putting in place policies supporting ADB\u2019s policies in promoting good governance \nand combating money laundering. \n \n12.  A QFI must meet the following selection criteria: \n \n(i)  be  a  regulated  financial  institution  and  the  target  of  an  ADB  nonsovereign \ninvestment; \n(ii)  have sound financials taking into account quality of assets, solvency, liquidity, \nprofitability, capital adequacy, and compliance with prudential norms; \n(iii)  have top management commitment to expand agriculture lending; \n(iv)  be willing to work with a QAC (existing and new customers) that is well-positioned \nto  evaluate  the  creditworthiness  of  farmers  and  their  ability  to  contribute  to \ncommercial agricultural value chains; \n(v)  management has put in place a project team and agrees to share risk and \npotentially TA cost; \n(vi)  have or be willing to put in place policies to support ADB in promoting good \ngovernance,  anti-money-laundering  efforts,  and  environmental  and  social \nsafeguards; \n(vii)  ADB is satisfied with the integrity due diligence carried out on the QFI; and \n(viii)  ADB is satisfied with the design of the measure in the context of existing and \nanticipated transactions. \n \n ", "4 \n \n13.  Phase 2: Structure of pilot projects. Once the pilot projects are identified by ADB, the \nrelevant  QFIs,  QACs,  and  ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector  Operations  Department  will  agree  in  TA \nagreement letters on the structure of pilot projects, customized terms of reference, detailed cost \nand financing arrangements, and consulting selection in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). Prior to the commencement of \nservices, ADB will obtain the host countries\u2019 no-objection to the TA measure. Subprojects may be \nstructured in the form of loans, guarantees, or equity investments by ADB, most likely via QFIs \nextending  defined  farm  investment  loans  to  small-scale  farmers,  and  augmented  by  risk \nsubordination of guarantees provided by QACs and interested socially oriented investors. \n \n14.  Phase 3: Pilot implementation. The assistance to farmers will  include operational \nsupport provided by the QAC and/or QFI. This includes (i) organizing farmers into groups, and \nintegrating buyers and exporters; (ii) measures to improve quality and productivity, by providing \nfarm management services including farmer training in sustainable farming practices including \nthe appropriate use of inputs, soil management, water conservation including efficient irrigation \ntechnologies, improved and climate-resilient seed varieties, climate adaptation, and post-harvest \npractices;  (iii)  farmers\u2019  access  to  finance  for  crop  loans  and  farm  investment  loans  and \nguarantees; and (iv) complementary measures to stabilize farm income and resilience, including \nadvice on financial planning and savings, payment services, crop diversification, and marketing. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,154,000, of which $750,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund ($455,000 from TASF-V and $295,000 from \nTASF-other sources). During implementation, QACs and QFIs are expected to share the cost by \ncontributing at least 35% to the total cost of at least $404,000. Details are provided in the cost \nestimates and financing plan (Appendix 2). \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  The TA will be executed by ADB, and the Financial Institutions Division of ADB\u2019s Private \nSector Operations Department will be responsible for implementing the TA. Consultant selection, \nincluding the selection method and specific terms of reference, will be agreed in subproject-\nspecific  TA  agreement  letters  with  relevant  QACs  and/or  QFIs  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and in coordination with ADB\u2019s Operations Services and \nFinancial  Management  Department.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for  consultants  are  in \nAppendix 3. Disbursements under the TA will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). ADB will organize regular \nconsultative meetings with the subproject teams and organize a workshop to discuss lessons \nlearned. The TA is expected to be completed by 31 December 2018. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $750,000 on a grant basis for \nSustainable Financing of Small-Scale Agriculture in South Asia and Southeast Asia, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n ", "Appendix 1  5 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData Sources \nPerformance Targets and  and Reporting  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact (2021)      Assumption \nScalable models for  Number of viable models  QAC and QFI  Macroeconomic and \ncommercial credit to  exceeding 1,000 farmers  progress reports  financial market stability \nsmall farmers via    Risks \ncontract farming and  Coverage of farmers  Climatic risks \nproduct aggregation  (number)  Adverse climate change \nestablished    trend \nOutcome (2019)       \nTwo successfully  Average net farmer income  QAC and QFI \ntested pilot projects  before and after the pilot test  progress reports \nlead to higher farm   \nhousehold incomes  Outstanding loans to small \nfarmers through value chain \nfunding arrangements \nincreased  \nOutput (2018)      Risks \nScalable farm credit  Up to 5 pilot projects signed  QAC and QFI and  Consultants QFI and \nto small farmers in  and executed by QACs and  consultant reports  QAC underperform \ncollaboration with  QFIs     \nQFIs and QACs      Farmer side selling \nappropriately  Good credit quality, defined    undermines execution \nstructured  by non-performing loans   \nabove 180 days not   \nexceeding 10% of total loans   \n   \nAgreed term sheets   \n   \nDiagnostics prepared for up   \nto five QFIs and QACs   \n   \nTA agreements implemented   \nfor at least 3 QFIs and QACs   \n   \nRegional seminar organized  Seminar \nwith private financial  presentations \ninstitutions and QACs \nActivities with Milestones  Inputs \n1.

The technical assistance (TA) will be delivered by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in \ncollaboration with qualified financial institutions (QFIs) and qualified agribusiness companies \n(QACs) in South Asia and Southeast Asia. ADB-selected QFIs and QACs will enter into TA \nagreements that set out the terms and conditions for the assistance, including the specific terms \nof reference, the expertise (national and local) required, cost, cost sharing, and selection method. \nThe assignments will be posted on ADB\u2019s website as business opportunities. Some TA measures \nmay be delegated to well-qualified QFIs and QACs. \n \n2.  The scope of the consultant services will be determined in agreement with the targeted \nQFIs and QACs to identify, design, and implement credit schemes made by QFIs to benefit small \nfarmers via contract farming and farm produce purchasing arrangements and sustainable farm \ntraining conducted by QACs. The consultant will prepare term sheets that QFIs and QACs will \nagree upon with ADB, including business plans and responsibilities for implementing farm and \ncredit training and financing proposed pilot projects. \n \n3.  The required expertise of consultants (including the distribution of international and \nnational experts) will be determined in agreement with the targeted QFIs and QACs through TA \nagreement letters. All experts must have the ability to effectively communicate with clients and \ntheir staff in imparting analysis, identifying solutions, and related training. The required expertise \nis likely to include the following: \n(i)  a banking and financial institution consultant with at least 10 years of relevant \nexperience; \n(ii)  an agribusiness expert with at least 10 years of experience in organizing farmer \ngroups for agribusiness supply chains, preferably in Asia; \n(iii)  extensive knowledge of agriculture finance; microfinance; and structuring of risk \nsubordination through equity, guarantees, and loans, with at least 10 years of \nexperience; and \n(iv)  a bank and financial institutions safeguard specialist with at least 5 years of \nrelevant experience. \n \n4.
