INTRODUCTION\n1. The microfinance development strategy (MDS) of the Asian Development Bank\n(ADB), approved in June 2000,1 emphasizes the importance of developing sustainable\nmicrofinance systems to fully harness the potential of microfinance for poverty reduction\nin the Asia and Pacific region. The MDS commits ADB to work in close consultation with\nother funding agencies providing support for the development of microfinance services\nand increase efforts to improve coordination among all such agencies. The regional\ntechnical assistance (TA) is one of the mechanisms through which ADB translates its\ncommitment  into  concrete  action.  The  TA  will  establish  a  mechanism  to  help  the\nConsultative  Group  to  Assist  the  Poorest  (CGAP)  strengthen  its  microfinance\ndevelopment activities in the region. The TA framework is presented in Appendix 1.\nAlthough ADB was one of the pioneering members of CGAP, established in 1995, ADB\nhas not contributed financially to CGAP\u2019s operations since its inception.\n2. In September 2000, CGAP asked ADB for partial funding for its microfinance\noperations  in  the  region.  Subsequent  to  this  request,  ADB  staff  consulted  CGAP\nexecutives  on  CGAP\u2019s  operations.  The  scope,  implementation  arrangements,  cost\nestimates, and financing plan of the TA2 are based on those consultations, a review of\nCGAP\u2019s operations during the last five years and its business plan for 2001-2003, and\nCGAP\u2019s annual report for 2000.3\nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n3. Microfinance, defined as the provision of financial services to low-income families\nand  their  microenterprises  (footnote  1),  has  increasingly  captured  the  attention  of\ngovernments, funding agencies, nongovernment organizations, and others interested in\neconomic  development  and  poverty  reduction.  With  this  increasing  emphasis,  the\noutreach4 of microfinance services has expanded during the last decade to serve 14\nmillion-18 million clients in the region. This, however, accounts for no more than 10\npercent of the potential market. Most microfinance clients are just below or above the\npoverty lines of their respective countries. In most countries, the poorest households5\nremain outside the reach of microfinance services.\n4. The microfinance industry has in general shown a significant bias toward the\nprovision of credit. Inadequate attention has been paid to the provision of other services,\nsuch  as  voluntary  savings  and  insurance,  although  these  services  are  often  more\nimportant  to  the  poorest  people.  Beside  the  low  outreach  level,  this  factor  has\nsignificantly limited the contribution that microfinance could make to poverty reduction on\na  significant  scale.  Thus,  broadening  the  services  microfinance  institutions  (MFIs)\nprovide to the poorest people remains a major challenge in the region.\n                                                \n1 R106-00: Finance for the Poor: Microfinance Development Strategy, 6 June 2000.\n2 The TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities in January 2001.\n3 Details of CGAP\u2019s operations are given in CGAP. 2000. Consultative Group to Assist the Poorest, Report\n2000, Washington, DC, CGAP. The CGAP web site (http://www.cgap.org) is also an excellent source of\ninformation on CGAP activities.\n4 Outreach has two dimensions: the number of clients and the extent of poverty of the clients served.\n5  The poorest are defined as those in the bottom 50 percent of the households below a country\u2019s poverty\nline.", "2\n5. To address this challenge in a systematic manner, a number of inter-related\nactivities are essential. First, innovative ways must be developed for MFIs to reach the\npoorest households. Second, MFIs must be encouraged to adopt similar innovations in\ntheir programs to reach the poorest. Third, the capacity of MFIs must be strengthened so\nthat they can provide financial services to a large number of the poorest households on\na financially sustainable basis. CGAP has a well-designed ongoing program that covers\nall three activities.\n6. CGAP is a global effort to reduce poverty by increasing access to financial\nservices for the poorest households through financially sustainable institutions. CGAP\nwas  launched  in  June  1995  with  the  participation  of  10  bilateral  and  multilateral\nassistance  organizations6  including  ADB.  During  the  first  three-year  phase,  CGAP\ndistilled and disseminated lessons and best practices in microfinance to practitioners\nand policymakers in government and funding agencies, helped develop a supportive\npolicy  environment  for  MFIs,  and  supported  innovation  in  the  sector  through  direct\ninvestments in selected MFIs. Funding agencies extended support for CGAP for another\nfive years beginning 1 July 1998, on the basis of its excellent performance during the\nfirst phase. The second phase will build on the achievements of the first, with a more\nexplicit  focus  on  institution  building  and  poverty  outreach  (Appendix  2).  CGAP\u2019s\ninstitution-building program includes two training programs to be conducted at ADB in\nMarch\u2013April 2001 for staff of funding agencies operating in the region, including ADB.\n7. In  2000,  CGAP  launched  an  intensive  program  of  case  studies  and  action\nresearch to document innovative ways in which MFIs reach the poorest households. The\ncase studies and research are expected to (i) expand the focus of financial services for\npoor  households  beyond  microcredit  (ii)  identify  innovative  financial  products  and\nservices that are more suitable to reach poor households and for potential funding by aid\nagencies and (iii) encourage MFIs to adapt these innovations to their programs and local\nconditions. The increased emphasis on poverty outreach is based on the recognition of a\ncontinuing significant mismatch between existing financial services and the needs of the\npoorest households. CGAP\u2019s ongoing pro-poor innovation case studies focus on\n(i)  Safesave, a savings bank for poor people in Bangladesh, which offers\nconvenient and flexible financial services to men, women, and children in\nthe poorest slums of Dhaka;\n(ii)  the Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee (BRAC) which organizes\nwomen into groups within a government safety-net program and provides\ntraining in income-generating activities;\n(iii)  the  health  insurance  programs  of  the  Self-Employed  Women\u2019s\nAssociation  (SEWA)  of  India,  to  learn  how  best  to  combine  financial\nservices with health care provision to protect the poor from vulnerabilities\nassociated with health crises;\n(iv)  the  Association  of  Social  Advancement  (ASA)  in  Bangladesh,  to\nunderstand challenges of providing flexible, voluntary savings services to\nthe poor; and\n                                                \n6 IN.181-95: Consultative Group to Assist the Poorest: A Microfinance Program, 9 October 1995.", "3\n(v)  Groupe de Recherche et d\u2019Echanges Technologique Cambodia, which\nprovides health insurance coverage for the poor.\n8. The ongoing action research of CGAP includes two projects:\n(i) Increasing  efficiency  and  outreach:  this  project  involving  Safesave\nBangladesh,  explores  the  possibility  of  using  hand-held  computers  to\nlower transactions costs, increase efficiency, and improve internal control.\nThe  findings  of  the  project  will  help  extend  financial  services  to  the\npoorest.\n(ii) Dynamics of MFI competition in Bangladesh: this project examines the\nlevel  of  MFI  concentration  and  the  challenges  of  increased  MFI\ncompetition  for  the  Bangladesh  microfinance  industry,  including  the\nimplications for providing services to the poorest.\n9. CGAP\u2019s  poverty  outreach  program  supports  the  development  of  innovative\nfinancial products and services that allow MFIs to meet the demand of the poorest\nhouseholds. For this purpose, CGAP launched a special program, Pro-Poor Innovation\nChallenge, in April 2000 to provide small grants to selected small, low profile MFIs that\nreach the poorest households through innovative products and mechanisms. MFIs are\nselected for awards based on the extent of their outreach, innovation, and commitment\nto  sustainability.  This  program  is  an  important  learning  opportunity  for  all  funding\nagencies and an effective means of identifying small MFIs that merit external support to\nbuild their capacity to reach the poorest. Through this mechanism, CGAP has supported\nnine MFIs.7\n10. New product development is a core challenge for the microfinance industry.\nIncreased competition, lack of outreach to the poorest households, and high dropout\nrates of clients in many programs have drawn attention to the need to consult with\nclients to develop demand-driven and viable financial services. CGAP is developing a\ncourse on new product development to respond to this challenge and especially to help\nMFIs interested in reaching very poor clients. The course will be used to train MFI\nmanagers who may carry out market research to better listen to and learn from clients\nand develop client-responsive pro-poor products. This will enable CGAP to disseminate\nknowledge about pro-poor innovations to MFIs in a systematic manner based on case\nstudies,  action  research,  and  information  gathered  through  Pro-Poor  Innovation\nChallenge.\n11. The MDS emphasized the importance of expanding the scope of MFIs to include\na wide array of services, providing support for pro-poor innovations to increase the\noutreach to poor segments of the potential market and building the capacity of MFIs to\nreach such clients in a sustainable manner. CGAP\u2019s operations cover these activities\nand CGAP has demonstrated its capacity to manage these activities efficiently and\nrespond to the demands of small-scale MFIs quickly and in a flexible manner. Thus,\nADB\u2019s support for CGAP activities focused on poverty outreach is appropriate to the\nMDS and potential clients in ADB\u2019s developing member countries.\n                                                \n7 Four of these MFIs are located in the region: Cashpor Financial and Technical Services Ltd. (India);\nPadakhep (Bangladesh); Swayan Krishi Sangam Microifnance Ltd. (India); and Groupe de Recherche et\nd\u2019Echanges Technologique (Cambodia).", "4\n12. As a consortium of 27 donor countries and aid agencies, CGAP is uniquely\npositioned to catalyze the efforts of the funding community and address industrywide\nconcerns in microfinance by advancing of industry knowledge and disseminating best\npractices.  CGAP\u2019s  activities  encompass  many  countries,  institutions  and  funding\nagencies and are based on partnerships with a wide variety of players involved in\nmicrofinance. ADB\u2019s support will enable CGAP to improve its focus on poverty outreach,\nenhance  CGAP\u2019s  catalytic  role  in  the  region,  and  help  achieve  ADB\u2019s  overarching\nobjective of poverty reduction.\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA. Objective\n13. The objective of the TA is to strengthen the capacity of MFIs in the region to\nprovide demand-driven financial services to the poorest households on a financially\nsustainable basis.\nB. Scope\n14. The TA includes three interrelated components that are in line with ADB\u2019s MDS\nand poverty reduction objective: (i) case studies and action research on innovative and\nsustainable  ways  of  providing  microfinance  services  to  the  poorest  households,\n(ii) support  for  selected  MFIs  to  develop  sustainable  pro-poor  innovations,  and  (iii)\ntraining of MFI staff on new product development and sustainable ways of expanding\noutreach to the poorest households.\n15. The TA will help CGAP expand the case study and action research program and\ndisseminate its results widely. Special attention will be paid to flexible and convenient\nsavings services; insurance services; and innovative ways of using microfinance to meet\nthe infrastructure needs of poor communities, including affordable water, sanitation,\nroads, and other facilities. The case studies and action research program will be focused\non the experiences of three selected MFIs.\n16. The TA will also provide support to expand and continue the Pro-Poor Innovation\nChallenge program through which CGAP encourages MFIs to develop cost-effective\ninnovations to reach poor households with a wide array of financial services such as\ninsurance and voluntary flexible savings facilities. CGAP received 180 applications for\nthe second round of the Pro-Poor Innovation Challenge, most of them from small MFIs.\nHowever, CGAP could fund only five MFIs, including two from the region, because of\nresource  constraints.  The  resources  provided  through  the  TA  will  enable  CGAP  to\nexpand and continue the program in the region.\n17. The TA will help CGAP to conduct three training programs for MFI staff in the\nregion on new product development and sustainable ways of expanding the outreach to\nthe  poorest  households.  Each  program  will  last  four  days  and  include  about  20\nparticipants from ADB\u2019s developing member countries.\nC. Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n18. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $700,000. ADB will finance $500,000 on a\ngrant basis from the ADB-funded TA Program. CGAP will contribute $200,000 in the", "5\nform of financial and staff resources, technical advisory services, and administrative\nsupport. Detailed cost estimates and a financing plan are given in Appendix 3.\nD. Implementation Arrangements\n19. The TA will be implemented over 36 months from July 2001, with an expected\ncompletion date of 30 June 2004. CGAP will be the Executing Agency for the TA, with\nresponsibility for the selection of MFIs in the region for case studies and action research\nin agreement with ADB, implementation of case studies and action research, and wide\ndissemination of their results. CGAP will submit to ADB the draft reports of the case\nstudies and action research, for review and comments; and the relevant final reports.\nCGAP will also be responsible for (i) screening applications from MFIs from the region\nfor  awards  under  CGAP\u2019s  ongoing  Pro-Poor  Innovation  Challenge  program,  (ii)\npresenting the awards, and (iii) ensuring the necessary follow-up activities. CGAP will\norganize and conduct training for MFI staff in the region. Given that the exact scope and\nextent of case studies and action research cannot be determined a priori, the type and\nextent of consulting services required for this component will be estimated only after\nMFIs for each case study and action research have been identified. However, it is\nestimated that the TA will require resource persons for two person-months to provide the\ntraining. CGAP will be responsible for recruiting and managing consultants and resource\npersons as and when necessary to carry out TA activities. The consultants and resource\npersons will be nationals of ADB\u2019s member countries and be engaged by CGAP in\naccordance with procedures acceptable to, and with the prior approval of, ADB.\n20. ADB will disburse the funds in two installments using ADB\u2019s advance payment\nfacility to enable activities to proceed on schedule. Before ADB releases the advances,\nCGAP will submit a detailed annual work plan showing the activities planned under each\nTA component. CGAP will liquidate all advances with receipts and other supporting\ndocumentation provided to ADB and submit semiannual progress and financial reports to\nADB on TA-supported activities. The second installment will be provided only upon full\nutilization  and  liquidation  of  the  first  installment.  ADB  and  CGAP  will  sign  a  TA\nagreement. ADB staff will conduct at least one review mission per year, including an\ninception and a final review mission. Within three months of TA completion, CGAP will\nsubmit  to  ADB  a  consolidated  final  report  that  includes  a  consolidated  financial\nstatement and an evaluation of all activities supported by the TA. Any amount advanced\nto CGAP but not utilized and properly liquidated will be returned to ADB within three\nmonths of TA completion. The Focal Point for Microfinance in Agriculture and Social\nSectors Department West will be responsible for coordinating and implementing TA\nactivities in consultation with other concerned departments and offices of ADB.\nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION\n21. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved\nthe provision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, in an amount not exceeding\n$500,000, for the purpose of Microfinance Outreach Initiatives of the Consultative Group\nto Assist the Poorest, and hereby reports such action to the Board.", "6\nAppendix 1, page 1\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK\nDesign Performance Monitoring Assumptions\nSummary Indicators/Targets Mechanisms and Risks\nGoal\n\u2022  Increase the outreach \u2022  More of the \u2022  Microbanking \u2022  Macroeconomic\nof microfinance poorest Bulletin statistics stability in the\ninstitutions (MFIs) households \u2022  Reports of the region\nserved by MFIs Consultative\nGroup to Assist\nthe Poorest\n(CGAP)\nPurpose\n\u2022  Improve the capacity of \u2022  By the end of \u2022  Microbanking \u2022  MFIs are\nMFIs to reach the 2003, more Bulletin statistics committed to\npoorest.

Introduction\n1. The Consultative Group to Assist the Poorest (CGAP) is an effort by several donor\ncountries and aid agencies to reduce poverty by increasing access to financial services for the\npoorest households through financially sustainable institutions. CGAP was launched in June\n1995 by 10 bilateral and multilateral funding agencies. The founding members are Canada,\nFrance,  Netherlands,  United  States,  African  Development  Bank,  Asian  Development  Bank\n(ADB), International Fund for Agricultural Development, United Nations Capital Development\nFund, United Nations Development Programme, and World Bank. Another 17 countries and\nfunding agencies have since joined the original 10 members to support CGAP initiatives. They\nare  Australia,  Belgium,  Denmark,  Finland,  Germany,  Italy,  Japan,  Luxembourg,  Norway,\nSweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development,\nEuropean Commission, Inter-American Development Bank, International Labor Office, and the\nUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development.\nB. Organizational Structure and Funding\n2. The consultative group, CGAP\u2019s board of directors, is responsible for setting strategic\ndirections, making policy decisions, approving the budget, and reviewing achievements. The\nconsultative group has 27 members and is currently chaired by a vice president of the World\nBank. The group has formed a six-member executive committee. Each member represents a\nconstituency  of  the  consultative  group.  The  executive  committee  facilitates  communication\namong  the  consultative  group,  the  policy  advisory  group,  and  CGAP  Secretariat.  The\nSecretariat  consists  of  a  team  of  14  professionals  responsible  for  implementing  CGAP\u2019s\nmandate. The Secretariat is housed in the World Bank and managed by a chief executive\nofficer. The policy advisory group is composed of distinguished microfinance practitioners and\nexperts. This group plays a strategic role in guiding and advising the consultative group and\nCGAP staff on CGAP\u2019s strategy and agenda.\n3. For the first three years of CGAP\u2019s operations, funding came primarily from the World\nBank which accounted for 80 percent of the total funding agency commitment of $38.2 million.\nNine other agencies accounted for the remaining 20 percent of this amount. Funding agency\ncommitments for 1999 and 2000 amounted to $9.28 million and $12.1 million, respectively. The\ncommitment for 1999 also came from the World Bank (67 percent) and 9 bilateral agencies. The\nWorld Bank accounted for 58 percent of the total commitments for 2000 while 14 bilateral\nagencies accounted for the remaining commitments for the year. Thus bilateral contributions\nincreased from 33 percent in 1999 to 42 percent in fiscal 2000. ADB has not made any cash\ncontribution to CGAP since its inception.\nC. CGAP\u2019s Activities and Clients\n4. The first phase of CGAP consisted of three years commencing in July 1995. In the first\nphase,  CGAP  played  a  pivotal  role  in  developing  a  common  language  for  the  industry,\ncatalyzing  the  move  toward  best  practice  performance  standards,  and  building  consensus\namong its varied stakeholders. The second phase of CGAP began in July 1998. Building on the\nachievements  of  the  first  phase,  CGAP  plans  a  sharper  focus  on  institution  building  and\nincreased outreach to the poorest households. CGAP\u2019s work focuses on five strategic themes:\n(i) supporting the development of microfinance institutions (MFIs), (ii) supporting changes in the\npractices of member funding agencies to improve their microfinance operations, (iii) increasing\n(Reference in text: page 2, para. 6)", "9\nAppendix 2, page 2\nthe outreach of MFIs to cover more of the poorest households, (iv) improving the legal and\nregulatory framework for MFIs, and (v) facilitating the commercialization of the industry.\n5. To  achieve  its  goal  of  reaching  the  poorest  households,  CGAP  serves  three  main\nstakeholders: MFIs and practitioners, member funding agencies, and the microfinance industry.\nCGAP offers direct and indirect technical assistance to MFIs and practitioners. It also provides\ntraining  for  practitioners  and  funding  agency  staff;  produces  technical  publications  and\noperational tools; invests in MFIs; and advises government officials, commercial banks, and\nother  industry  players.  In  short,  CGAP  has  evolved  into  a  service  center  for  the  global\nmicrofinance industry.\n6. Although it is not a major source of funding for microfinance, CGAP uses its grant facility\nto support a small number of promising MFIs. By June 2000, CGAP had directly or indirectly\nprovided about $21 million to 35 MFIs around the world. These MFIs vary in structure but share\ntwo features: (i) they reach the poorest households, and (ii) they show potential for massive\ngrowth in outreach and steady progress toward commercial viability. CGAP has also invested\nabout $1.5 million in local and regional networks to enable an exchange of learning among\nMFIs. As part of its renewed commitment to extending outreach to the poorest clients, in April\n2000, CGAP launched the Pro-Poor Innovation Challenge. The program provides an important\nboost to CGAP\u2019s poverty agenda by (i) awarding grants to MFIs that reach the poorest clients\nthrough innovative products and delivery mechanisms, and (ii) providing a learning opportunity\nfor the industry on products, services, and delivery systems for the poorest.\n7. CGAP has provided technical assistance to a number of MFIs in the region. These\ninclude CARD Bank and Project Dungganon in the Philippines, and XAC HAS in Mongolia.\nCurrently, CGAP is assisting SEWA Bank in India to establish a microinsurance company to\nprovide life, health, and property insurance services to very poor women. CGAP also played a\nmajor  role  in  the  establishment  of  the  China  Microfinance  Training  Center  at  the  Rural\nDevelopment Institute of the People\u2019s Republic of China.\n8. CGAP\u2019s services to member funding agencies include technical tools, funding agency\nstaff training, and technical advice on microfinance programming. CGAP currently offers two\ntraining programs for funding agencies and will offer these at ADB in March-April 2001 for staff\nof funding agencies operating in the region, including ADB.\n9. As part of its efforts to increase the focus on serving the poorest, CGAP has developed\na poverty audit to integrate a poverty focus into CGAP\u2019s MFI appraisal format. The format has\nconventionally emphasized financial sustainability. The poverty audit emphasizes the extent of\noutreach and impact on the lives of the poor. This integration allows a more holistic appraisal of\nMFIs, and of poverty focus and sustainability as the twin objectives of the microfinance industry.\n10. CGAP has developed a comprehensive web site as a means of communicating with,\nand disseminating information to, its stakeholders. The web site provides up-to-date information\non CGAP\u2019s operations and services to its clients. Recently it has added a microfinance gateway\nto its web site to improve practitioners \u2018 access to microfinance documents. The web site can be\naccessed through www.cgap.org.", "10\n                Appendix 3\nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN\nItem Total Cost ($)\nA. ADB Financinga\n 1.
