INTRODUCTION \n1.  Since its initiation in 2001, the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) \nprogram  has  made  significant  progress  toward  its  goal  of  development  by  promoting  and \nfacilitating regional  cooperation  in  transport,  energy,  trade,  and  other key  areas  of mutual \ninterest.  The  program  has  grown  to  become  a  premier  regional  cooperation  mechanism \nanchored  on  partnership  among  10  member  countries  with  the  support  of  six  multilateral \ninstitutions.1 The flexibility and pragmatism that guide CAREC operations have worked well in \nallowing  countries  to  proceed  multitrack  and  multispeed.  The  program  proactively  enables \nresults-based regional projects and policy initiatives critical to trade expansion and sustainable \ndevelopment. CAREC operations have grown rapidly over the past 15 years. In 2001, the first \nsix CAREC-related projects were approved with a combined value of $247 million. As of the end \nof 2015, a total of 166 projects have been approved with an aggregate amount of $27.7 billion, \nreinforced with policy dialogues to ensure the investment returns. Continuous support to the \nCAREC program was reiterated in the Joint Ministerial Statement of the 14th CAREC Ministerial \nConference held in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia on 25 September 2015.2 The Asian Development \nBank (ADB) plays a multifaceted role, including that of lead or coordinating development partner \nand  honest  broker,  provider  and  facilitator  of  investment financing,  and  secretariat for  the \nCAREC program.  \n \n2.  ADB  has  supported  regional  economic  cooperation  in  Central  Asia  and  the \nimplementation  of  CAREC  through  several  technical  assistance  (TA).3 Since  the  ongoing \n\u201cumbrella\u201d  TA  was  approved  in  August  2012,  the  program  has  entered  a  new  stage  of \nimplementation and made remarkable achievements, including the following:4 \n(i)  The Wuhan Action Plan, endorsed at the 11th CAREC Ministerial Meeting in \nOctober 2012, charts the next steps of the CAREC program, with the aim of \nachieving seamless connectivity and greater prosperity in the region. As a first \nstep, the CAREC governments formulated a list of medium-term priority projects \nto mainstream regional cooperation fully into the national development strategies. \n(ii)  With regard to transport, a midterm review of the Transport and Trade Facilitation \nStrategy  was  conducted  in  2012\u20132013  and  a  refined  Strategy  20205 was \nendorsed at the 12th CAREC Ministerial Meeting in November 2013. To expand \nthe multimodal corridor network further, priority infrastructure projects and a set \n                                                \n1 The CAREC member countries are Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, the People\u2019s Republic of China, Kazakhstan, the \nKyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. The six CAREC multilateral \ninstitution partners are ADB, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International Monetary \nFund, the Islamic Development Bank, the United Nations Development Programme, and the World Bank. ADB is \nCAREC Secretariat. \n2  Joint Ministerial Statement at the 14th Ministerial Conference given in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia on September 2015. \nhttp://www.carecprogram.org/uploads/events/2015/029-14th-CAREC-Ministerial-Conference/Key-Documents/2015-\nCAREC-MC-Joint-Ministerial-Statement.pdf. \n3  Earlier ADB TA projects comprise: (i) ADB. 2012. Technical Assistance for Enhancing Coordination of the Central \nAsia Regional Economic Cooperation Program. Manila (TA 8148-REG). (ii) ADB. 2007.

Technical Assistance for Enhancing Coordination of the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation \nProgram. Manila (TA 8148-REG, $3 million, approved on 30 August). The TA was implemented from September \n2012 to August 2015. After a major change of scope was approved in June 2014, the TA completion date was \nextended to 31 August 2016 and the amount increased by $2.5 million. \n5  ADB. 2014. CAREC Transport and Trade Facilitation Strategy 2020. Manila. \n ", "2   \nof complementary soft sector initiatives have been identified in the areas of road \nsafety, railway development strategy, road asset management, and transport \nfacilitation. \n(iii)  To facilitate trade, the CAREC countries have intensified efforts to (a) align their \ncustoms legal framework with the Revised Kyoto Convention, (b) assess the \nscope and cost of modernizing sanitary and phytosanitary measures to facilitate \ntrade, and (c) establish a low-cost regional transit regime. \n(iv)  With regard to energy, progress was made under the Energy Work Plan, 2013\u2013\n2015,6 and a new Energy Strategy and Work Plan, 2016\u201320207 was developed \nand adopted at the 14th CAREC Ministerial Meeting in September 2015. The \nnew  strategy  refines  its  focuses  on  investments  in  cross-border  energy \ninfrastructure, energy trade, the development and prioritization of sustainable \nenergy resources, energy efficiency, clean energy, and new technologies. \n(v)  With regard to trade policy, a Trade Policy Strategic Action Plan, 2013\u20132017 was \nendorsed at the 12th CAREC Ministerial Meeting in November 2013 expanding \nits  agenda  to  support the  implementation  of the World Trade Organization\u2019s \naccession  and  post-accession  commitments;  trade  in  industrial  goods  and \nservices; and tariff issues and non-tariff barriers. Two more CAREC members \nacceded  to  the  World  Trade  Organization:  Tajikistan  in  May  2013  and \nKazakhstan in November 2015. \n(vi)  With  regard  to  economic  corridor  development,  the  Almaty\u2013Bishkek  Corridor \nInitiative  was  endorsed  at  the  13th  Ministerial  Meeting  in  2014,  and  a  joint \nworking group between the two cities was established thereafter. This initiative is \nmaking good progress towards completing a comprehensive report reflecting a \nholistic  and  multisectoral  approach  to  economic  corridor  development  and \nidentifying the policy, institutional, and infrastructure requirements for the pilot \ninitiative. \n(vii)  With regard to knowledge initiatives, the physical base of the CAREC Institute \nwas launched and began initial operations in March 2015 in Urumqi, Xinjiang \nUygur Autonomous Region, People\u2019s Republic of China. \n3.  This policy and advisory TA8 will enable ADB to support the CAREC program further in \nits  second  decade  of  implementation,  with  the  goal  of  strengthening  regional  economic \ncooperation in the CAREC region. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  As the reintegration of the Eurasian continent gathers momentum, the CAREC countries \nhave an unprecedented opportunity to emerge as a center for trade and commerce and achieve \nhigher levels of inclusive economic growth. In isolation, none of the region's economies will be \nable to capture this opportunity fully, but all will benefit from working together to build on their \nstrengths  for  mutual  progress.  The  CAREC  countries  are  increasingly  recognizing  the \nimportance of CAREC in helping them adapt to emerging challenges in an economic landscape \nthat is rapidly changing, both regionally and globally. By reflecting on key lessons from the past \n15 years and taking into account ADB\u2019s first Regional Cooperation and Integration Operational \nPlan9 and  the  recommendations  from  the  Independent  Evaluation  Department\u2019s  Thematic \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2012. Energy Sector Coordinating Committee Work Plan 2013\u20132015. Manila. \n7  ADB. 2015. Strategy and Work Plan (2016\u20132020) for Regional Cooperation in the Energy Sector of CAREC \nCountries. Manila. \n8  The Vice-President for Operations 1 approved The TA concept paper on 13 June 2016. \n9  Under preparation and expected to be approved in the third quarter of 2016. \n ", "  3 \nEvaluation Study on ADB support for regional cooperation and integration,10 CAREC can further \nenhance its coordination in the following areas: \n(i)  Stronger country ownership. As CAREC countries continue to develop awareness \nof the importance of regional cooperation in achieving national development goals, \ncountry ownership of the CAREC program must be enhanced further to reflect the \ncomplementary role of regional initiatives more explicitly in their respective national \ndevelopment plans. \n(ii)  A more innovative agenda. The multiplicity of regional forums and institutions could \nstrain country-level capabilities in managing their participation in various regional \ninitiatives,  which  may  result  in  less  than  effective  participation  in  the  overall \ninstitutional CAREC framework (see Appendix 2).11 It is thus essential to innovate \nand keep agendas highly relevant to ensure the strong, consistent engagement of \nthe CAREC members. \n(iii)  More responsive working mechanism. CAREC continues to undergo a widening \nand deepening process in response to the changing global, regional, and national \neconomic, social, and political landscapes. A more responsive overall institutional \nframework is required to ensure that all parties concerned at different levels act \njointly and more vigorously to engage with and tap the expertise and resources of all \nexisting and potential CAREC stakeholders. \n(iv)  More  effective  financing  coordination.  Along  with  the  changing  financial \nlandscapes, CAREC needs to fine-tune its strategic positioning in the individual \nsector and the program as a whole to keep finding new ways of doing business and \nbringing new values to developing member countries to maintain CAREC as an \neffective  platform  to  increase  international  interest  in  investing  in  regional \nconnectivity infrastructure. \n(v)  More  robust  sector  cooperation.  Since  its  initiation,  CAREC  priority  sector \ncooperation has achieved tangible results. Meanwhile, CAREC sector coordinating \ncommittees  are  facing  challenges  in  implementing  respective  sector-specific \nstrategies,  formulating  more  innovative  projects,  and  mobilizing  more  financial \nresources to bridge the funding gap. \n(vi)  Greater  support  for  economic  corridor  development.  As  CAREC  countries \nbecome  more  physically  connected  and  continue  to  develop,  it  is  increasingly \nnecessary for them to cooperate at a higher level and focus on linking markets, ideas, \nand people. Developing economic corridors can further this next generation agenda. \nConsistent efforts in this area can bring together existing and new infrastructure, \npolicies, and institutions to attract private investment that will create jobs and growth. \n(vii)  Continuous  interface  with  the  private  sector.  Promoting  public\u2013private \npartnership by actively reaching out to and engaging with the private sector has \nalways been a focus of CAREC. The dual-track approach of effectively involving the \nprivate sector at both the program and project level will remain valuable. \n(viii)  Enhanced  regional  cooperation  through  new  membership.  Georgia  has \nexpressed its interest in joining the CAREC program as its 11th member. Expanding \nCAREC\u2019s membership will enhance the program\u2019s regional impact and make the \nSecretariat\u2019s coordination work more challenging. \n                                                \n10 ADB.  2015.  Asian  Development  Bank  Support  for  Regional  Cooperation  and  Integration.  Manila. \nhttp://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/evaluation-document/110946/files/adb-support-rci.pdf. \n11 CAREC\u2019s overall institutional framework is the governing structure of the CAREC program, which defines the \nministerial conference as the decision-making body, the senior officials\u2019 meeting as the recommendatory body to \nthe ministerial conference, and the sector coordinating committees as responsible for ensuring the effective and \ntimely implementation of the medium-term priority projects and formulation of their respective strategies and action \nplans. \n ", "4   \n \n5.  It is thus increasingly necessary for ADB and CAREC to demonstrate strong support, \nresponsiveness,  and  flexibility  to  address  challenges  stemming  from  resource  constraints, \neffective coordination, the alignment of national and regional initiatives, and increasing technical \ndemands as CAREC countries progressively move toward stronger regional cooperation.  \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The project impact is aligned with strengthened regional economic cooperation in the \nCAREC  region.  The  outcome  will  be  enhanced  coordination  among  CAREC  stakeholders, \nincluding national and sector focal points, private sector groupings, and development partners in \nthe region.  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n7.  The key outputs are (i) planned multisector and multitrack approach promoted by high-\nlevel  CAREC  meetings,  (ii)  knowledge  products  for  deepening  and  widening  the  CAREC \nprogram prepared and disseminated, (iii) regular dialogue and information exchanged among \nADB and other development partners, and (iv) CAREC program\u2019s outreach and promotional \nmeans diversified and strengthened. \n \n8.  Planned  multisector  and  multitrack  approach  promoted  by  the  Central  Asia \nRegional Economic Cooperation Program\u2019s high-level meetings. The program will continue \nto emphasize infrastructure connectivity, but will need to complement this with other types of \ninvestment to support member countries\u2019 efforts to transform their economies in step with urban \nagglomeration, economic diversification, and interventions to strengthen cooperation in other \nareas to address social and other aspects of trade expansion and improved competitiveness. \nRecognizing member countries\u2019 different developmental levels, the program will maintain its \nmultitrack  approach  in  identifying  pilot  countries,  trade  routes,  and  corridors  to  generate \ndemonstrations for the rest to follow. CAREC has convened regular, significant, and high-profile \nmeetings involving ministers, senior government officials, and development partners, which play \nan important role in determining the program\u2019s direction and strategy. The TA will continue to \nsupport these annual meetings, as well as other side meetings and events that promote a \nmultisector and multitrack approach to resolving issues associated with the implementation of \nCAREC 2020.  \n \n9.  Knowledge  products  for  deepening  and  widening  the  Central  Asia  Regional \nEconomic Cooperation program prepared and disseminated. Knowledge products will be \nmade available in the form of publications, multimedia, and training sessions to build on and \nfurther develop the CAREC countries\u2019 knowledge base. The knowledge products will address \nthe CAREC countries\u2019 particular capabilities and operational needs in the form of capacity \nbuilding. The TA will ensure the timely production, proper dissemination, and wider reach of \nknowledge  products.  By  increasing  awareness  of  the  importance  of  regional  cooperation, \nCAREC\u2019s contribution through its activities and projects, as well as the benefits derived from the \nprogram, will attract more support and develop stronger commitment and country ownership. \n \n 10.   Regular dialogue and information exchanged among ADB and other development \npartners.  The TA will continue to encourage concerted efforts from ADB, its development \npartners, and bilateral aid agencies to respond to the CAREC countries\u2019 development needs, \nmobilize resources more effectively, and take full advantage of the benefits of this alliance. \n ", "  5 \n11.  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  program\u2019s  outreach  and \npromotional means diversified and strengthened. With the support of the TA, the CAREC \nteam will continue to improve and innovate in organizing outreach activities, providing several \nforums popularizing CAREC to gain broader support, and holding in-depth discussions on how \nto make CAREC more relevant and responsive. The website, which serves as the repository of \nrelevant documents and publications, will be periodically maintained and improved to fulfill its \nfunction as the primary information portal. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $2 million equivalent, which will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The cost estimates and financing plan \nare in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months from September 2016 to August 2018. ADB \nwill be the executing agency. In ADB, the Regional Cooperation and Operations Coordination \nDivision of ADB\u2019s Central and West Asia Department will be responsible for administering and \nsupervising the TA. \n \n14.  The TA will finance approximately 10 person-months of international and 360 person-\nmonths of national consulting services, to be engaged annually during the implementation \nperiod.  ADB  will  employ  consultants  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time). International consultants will include experts \nin sector and regional cooperation and public relations to provide technical advice and analytic \nsupport on a range of issues relating to regional economic cooperation and the implementation \nof CAREC strategies and action plans, as well as to help produce promotional, informational, \nand general media materials. National consultants based  at ADB headquarters and in the \nCAREC member countries will include (i) national advisors to the CAREC national focal points, \n(ii) regional cooperation coordinators, (iii) sector experts and coordinators, (iv) two regional \ncooperation program officers, (v) a regional cooperation program analyst, (vi) a web developer \nand administrator, (vii) a website and publications expert, and (viii) an administrative coordinator. \nInternational and national resource persons will also be engaged. The consultants\u2019 outline terms \nof reference are in Appendix 3. The consultants will be recruited as individuals and not through \na firm, because (i) they will be operating in different countries, (ii) their work and outputs are \nindependent  of  each  other,  and  (iii)  the  CAREC  unit  within  the  Central  and  West  Asia \nDepartment will manage them overall. \n \n15.  The  TA  equipment  budget  includes  computers  and  small  office  equipment  to  be \nprocured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to \ntime). TA funds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $2,000,000 on a grant basis \nfor Enhancing Coordination of the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Program, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the TA is Aligned with:  \nStrengthened regional economic cooperation in the CAREC region (CAREC 2020)a \n  Performance Indicators  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  with Targets and Baselines  Reporting  Risks \nOutcome       \nEnhanced  a.
