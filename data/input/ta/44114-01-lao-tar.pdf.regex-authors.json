INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  Following the successful completion of the Private Sector and Small and Medium-Sized \nEnterprises Development Program, in  October 2009, the Government of the Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic (Lao PDR) asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for assistance in \nimplementing the post-program partnership framework (P3F) developed during the program. In \nJuly 2009, a fact-finding mission visited the Lao PDR and reached an understanding with the \ngovernment  on  the  objectives,  scope,  and  implementation  arrangements  for  the  technical \nassistance (TA), Support for the Post-Private Sector and Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises \nDevelopment Program Partnership Framework.1 The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1.2 \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  ADB assistance for private sector development in the Lao PDR began in 2005 with \nproject  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  the  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises \n(SMEs) development program. Through the TA, ADB provided inputs into the drafting of the \n2005 Law on Enterprise and the formulation of the national SME development strategy. In \nOctober 2007, the ADB Board of Directors approved a grant for the Private Sector and Small \nand  Medium-Sized  Enterprises  Development  Program,  which  included  a  series  of  policy \nmeasures to advance private sector development reforms.3 Key accomplishments included the \nenterprise law and the SME strategy, simplifying business registration procedures designed to \nensure registration is accomplished within the legislated 10-day deadline; establishment of the \nenterprise registry office and seven pilot-tested provincial enterprise registry offices; and the \ndrafting of a new investment promotion law to promote national standards for foreign and \ndomestic investors and simplify the investment approval process. ADB estimates that the cost of \nenterprise registration has been cut by 35% as a result of the enterprise registration reforms.4  \n \n3.  Lessons from the 2007 program and other ADB programs in the sector relevant to the \nproposed TA include (i) political support is crucial for successful implementation of reforms;  \n(ii) continuing policy dialogue and policy development are important for sustaining reforms; and \n(iii) institutional development and engagement of stakeholders in the program are necessary for \nquality policy development. In response to these lessons, subprogram 2 of the Private Sector \nand SMEs Development Program included a post-program partnership framework (P3F).5 The \nP3F provides the government\u2019s short-term plan focusing on advancing its reforms through the \naccomplishment of 11 priority policy measures and associated capacity building to strengthen \nthe business climate and facilitate greater trade integration of the Lao PDR economy within the \nGreater  Mekong  Subregion  and  the  rest  of  the  world  (Appendix  4).  The  P3F  aims  to  (i) \nstrengthen  the  investment  climate  including  finishing  the  national  rollout  of  the  enterprise \nregistry  to  the  remaining  10  provinces  and  assisting  the  government  in  developing  and \nimplementing  a  national  competition  policy  and  regulatory  reform  program;  (ii)  support \nimplementation of SME policy and access to finance; and (iii) strengthen trade policy capacity \nand trade facilitation. The P3F may provide the basis for a second-generation program on \n                                                 \n1  The TA concept clearance by Vice-President (Operations 2) was provided on 4 February 2010. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 3 September 2010. \n3  ADB. 2007.

Therefore, the TA is to continue to build on ADB assistance in the sector and support the \ngovernment's broader reform momentum to create an enabling environment for businesses to \noperate efficiently. It will do this by assisting the government to implement its short-term action \nplan agreed with ADB in the P3F. An innovative feature of the TA is the establishment of a \nprivate  sector  forum  (PSF)  comprising  representatives  from  the  Lao  National  Chamber  of \nCommerce  and  Industry,  the  business  sector,  and  academia.  The  PSF\u2019s  mandate  will  be \nthreefold: (i) provide input, which will be used to assist in formulating the second-generation \nprogram, to the project team to identify binding constraints to private sector growth and practical \nsolutions to addressing them; (ii) support monitoring of the implementation of TA activities; and \n(iii) partner with the project team in advocacy activities.  \n \n5.  Constraints to private sector development. The Lao PDR continues to rank low in \nseveral  international  surveys  of  competitiveness  because  of  high  transaction  costs  in  the \nregulatory environment, prevalence of nontariff barriers, trade facilitation, and an undeveloped \nlogistics sector. The enterprise survey of German development cooperation through GTZ in \n2009  provides  information  about  changes  in  perceptions  or  awareness  about  business \nconstraints.7 It finds that business reported increased problems in 2009 over 2007 with access \nto capital; excessive red tape; access to skilled technical labor, accountants, and management; \naccess to technology and business development service providers; and competition in domestic \nmarkets. Two ADB diagnostic studies carried out under subprogram 2 (footnote 4) highlight key \nareas for improvement. The 2009 ADB red tape study estimates that the cost to the business \ncommunity to comply with the licensing and regulatory regime was about 1.5%\u20133.0% of gross \ndomestic product in 2008. The burden of business regulatory costs falls disproportionately on \nsmall enterprises. ADB estimates of effective rates of protection, which measure the extent to \nwhich trade policy has raised prices above international rates, are relatively low, although \npockets of significant protection to industry still exist in food and beverages, metal products, and \nsome chemicals. The effective rates of protection estimates also indicate that the trade policy \nregime is biased against sectors with potential for export of goods (agriculture, textiles, and \ngarments) as reflected in substantial negative protection for these sectors.  \n \n6.  Competition  in  domestic  markets.  A  common  thread  of  many  of  the  investment \nclimate  studies  and  surveys  is  the  country\u2019s  weak  competition  policy  framework,  which  is \nbroadly defined to include distortions at the border (non-tariff barriers) and more significantly \nbehind the border (technical barriers to trade, industry regulation, licensing and entry restrictions \nin  key  sectors,  and  investment  incentives).  Several  industries  with  economy-wide  linkages \nremain  protected  by  anticompetition  regulations  such  as  in  the  cement,  steel,  and \npharmaceutical  industries.8 Pockets  of  protection  from  import  competition  exist  in  several \nsectors, especially for food and beverages. A prime minister's decree prohibits certain kinds of \nanti-competitive practices, but has never been implemented for several reasons: (i) no public \nadvocacy was used to build support for and understanding of the need for a competition policy \nand  related legislation; (ii) the decree was complex for a transitional economy like the Lao PDR; \nand (iii) at the time of approval of the decree in 2004, no resources were available to establish \nand build capacity of the competition agency. \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2008.

Excessive procedures affecting business operations. The government has made \nprogress in simplifying procedures for business startups, and plans to complete the national \nrollout of the enterprise registration system to the remaining 10 provinces. Nevertheless, the \nlicensing regime remains costly to business. These costs are particularly burdensome on SMEs. \nTo help improve the quality of regulations at entry and minimize compliance costs for the private \nsector, a more systematic approach needs to be taken in their formulation and/or review. \nIdeally, and following international best practice on regulatory impact assessment, this would \ninvolve use of a systematic approach to assess and make transparent the costs of particular \nregulations for individual firms as well as the economy as a whole. This is a long-term effort. As \na starting point, the government should start with raising public awareness on the need for a \nregulatory reform program. Under subprogram 2 (footnote 5), the government established an \ninterministerial task force mandated to develop an action plan for institutionalizing a regulatory \nimpact assessment program across the national government. The Ministry of Industry and \nCommerce (MOIC) has agreed to pilot a regulatory impact assessment program to build good \npractice in regulation.  \n \n8.  Business  development  constraints.  Enterprises  are  faced  with  several  capacity \nconstraints to business development. The first is the poor accounting and financial reporting \ncapacity of SMEs, which limits access to finance. According to the GTZ enterprise survey, 75% \nof microenterprises, 54% of small enterprises, and 25% of medium-sized enterprises do not \nkeep proper bookkeeping records. The second constraint is limited access to private sector \nbusiness development service providers. The GTZ survey found that less than 45% of small \nfirms had ever used a business development service provider. Business development service \nproviders  cover  a  wide  range  of  services  such  as  small  business  management  advisers, \naccounting professionals, tax advisers, technical business advisers, and providers of sanitary \nand phytosanitary (SPS) standards.  \n \n9.  Trade policy and facilitation. For a small economy like the Lao PDR, regional and \ninternational  trade  is  a  major  driver  of  economic  growth  for  the  nonresource  sector.  The \ngovernment considers accession to the World Trade Organization to be a key foreign trade \npolicy priority and this is accelerating the momentum for finishing the trade reform agenda. In \nthis  regard,  MOIC  is  considering  ways  to  accelerate  reforms  for  the  import  and  export \nmanagement system. Reforms are also needed to reduce the remaining nontariff barriers and \ninvestment distortions including technical barriers to trade, reform of trade facilitation (such as \nSPS standards systems), and consolidation of other incentives that negatively affect investment \nand trade decisions.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The impact of the TA will be an improved business environment. The outcome of the TA \nwill be implementation of key policy measures under the P3F.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n1.  Output 1: Investment Climate \n \n11.  Competition policy.

The activities are \ndivided into two parts: (i) competition law and (ii) regulatory impact assessment program. \n ", "4     \n \n12.  Competition law activities include (i) carrying out a series of sector case studies on \ncompetition policy issues; (ii) developing a competition policy framework and drafting a revised \ncompetition  policy  decree,  and  (iii)  conducting  a  series  of  seminars  and  workshops  on \ncompetition policy.  \n \n13.  The  regulatory  impact  assessment  program  will  support  the  interministerial \ncommittee on regulatory impact assessment (RIA) chaired by the vice minister for industry and \ncommerce. The task force was established as a policy trigger under subprogram 2 of the Private \nSector  and  SME  Development  Program,  and  its  functions  are  an  integral  part  of  the \ngovernment's short-term action plan under the P3F. The task force is responsible for building \npublic  awareness  and  support  for  a  regulatory  review  process  (and  RIA  program),  and \nfacilitating the design and development of an action plan and time frame for implementing RIA \nacross ministries. The activity is envisaged to take 1.5\u20132 years. An integral part of this is \nestablishing a pilot RIA at MOIC to build capacity and learn the most appropriate way to \ninstitutionalize an RIA that best suits the Lao PDR situation. \n \n14.  Rollout of the business registry offices. This intervention supports regulatory reform \nand  builds  on  activities  under  the  Private  Sector  and  SMEs  Development  Program  by \ncompleting the national rollout of the business registry information management system and \nsimplified registration procedures in the remaining 10 provinces (of 17 provinces). MOIC\u2019s \nEnterprise Registry Office is the implementing agency for this output. The output will be the \nestablishment of hardware and software for provincial registries linked to the central registry in \nVientiane through the web-based system piloted under subprogram 2. This activity will also \nwork  with  MOIC  and  relevant  government  authorities  (Ministry  of  Finance)  to  establish  a \nframework for ensuring financial sustainability of the provincial registry offices. \n \n  2.  Output 2: Implementation of SME Policy and Access to Finance \n \n15.  This intervention will help the SME Promotion and Development Office (SMEPDO) at \nMOIC  (the  implementing  agency)  to  implement  selected  components  of  the  national  SME \nstrategy.  These  include  (i)  implementing  reforms  and  activities  to  develop  the  accounting \nprofession  to  enhance  SME  access  to  accounting  services;  (ii)  improving  SME  access  to \ntechnology and its adoption, among other activities; and (iii) assessing the feasibility of a public\u2013\nprivate partnership partial loan guarantee facility. \n \n  3.  Output 3: Trade Policy Capacity and Trade Facilitation \n \n16.  This  component  will  assist  the  Department  of  Foreign  Trade  Policy  at  MOIC  (the \nimplementing agency) to enhance its trade policy capacity and trade facilitation by (i) providing \ncapacity development on trade policy tools through staff training and workshops; (ii) assisting \nwith  input  on  revising  trade  regulations  consistent  with  World  Trade  Organization  rules \n(including remaining trade decrees, establishment of the framework for technical barriers to \ntrade and SPS inquiry points and notifications to World Trade Organization, trade remedies, and \nother  reforms);  and  (iii)  assisting  with  and  providing  capacity  development  in  establishing \ntechnical  barriers  to  trade,  SPS  inquiry  points,  notification  procedures,  and  relevant  staff \ntraining.  \n \nB.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,190,000. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB, through the provision \nof $1,000,000 equivalent. The government will finance the remaining $190,000 equivalent to \n ", "  5\ncover the counterpart in-kind costs. The TA cost estimates and financing plan are in Table A2.1 \nand a breakdown of the TA cost estimates by component is in Table A2.2. \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  MOIC\u2019s SMEPDO will be the executing agency. MOIC\u2019s Department of Foreign Trade \nPolicy and Department of Domestic Trade Department, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of \nPlanning and Investment, and the RIA interministerial task force (chaired by the vice minister of \nindustry and commerce) will be the implementing agencies. SMEPDO will provide office space \nwith furniture and support services for the consultants; the TA will provide office computers and \nsupplies.  A  team  of  eight  international  consultants  (total  of  28  person-months)  and  three \nnational  consultants  (total  of  60  person-months)  will  be  engaged  through  international \ncompetitive bidding to carry out the TA activities in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The project (through the national \neconomist) will also engage up to a total of six research assistants to support the international \nconsultants and the PSF in carrying out TA activities. Disbursements under the TA will be made \nin accordance with ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended \nfrom time to time). The project officer at the project management unit (PMU) will procure the TA \nequipment following ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time); the \nassets will be handed over to SMEPDO upon completion of the project. \n \n19.  A PMU, to be established at SMEPDO, will coordinate the TA activities; undertake \noverall administrative and supervisory tasks, communication, financial transactions with ADB, \nannual  auditing,  and  progress  monitoring;  and  provide  administrative  support  to  the  RIA \ninterministerial task force and the PSF. Given the number of project activities to be administered \nby the PMU, the advance payment facility will be used (advances based on 6-month budget \nforecasts). \n \n20.  The TA will be implemented from October 2010 to March 2014, following the signing of \nthe TA agreement between the government and ADB. Consultant deliverables are outlined in \nthe terms of references (Appendix 3). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $1,000,000  to  the \nGovernment of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic to be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction for Support for Post-Private Sector and Small and Medium-\nSized Enterprises Development Program Partnership Framework, and hereby reports this action \nto the Board.  \n \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1   \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n  Performance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact       Assumption \nAn improved  By end\u20132013:    The government stays on course with \nbusiness      key business regulatory reform. \nenvironment.

The Asian Development Bank (ADB) country strategy and program 2007\u20132011 for the \nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) identifies private sector development as a key \nthematic initiative.1 It emphasizes that ADB will help the government improve the climate for \nprivate sector development through support for policy, and institutional and regulatory reform in \nsectors in which ADB operates\u2014transforming the agriculture sector from subsistence farming to \na commercial orientation, improving basic transport and power infrastructure, strengthening the \nregulatory regime governing financial institutions, restructuring state-owned commercial banks, \nimproving  investment  regulations,  fostering  growth  of  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises \n(SMEs),  mobilizing  resources  and  broadening  access  to  financing  for  private  sector \ndevelopment, and enhancing the soundness and sustainability of public finance.  \n \n2.  The Private Sector and Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises Development Program \n(2007\u20132009) operationalized the country strategy and program by providing support for the \nbusiness climate, trade reforms, and related capacity building at the relevant agencies. The \nprogram was structured as a cluster and aimed to help the government achieve its medium- to \nlong-term goals of sustained economic growth of 7%\u20138% per annum, expansion of the private \nsector, and poverty reduction. The program focused on three core areas directly affecting \nprivate sector development and growth: (i) institutional coordination in SME policy formulation \nand access to finance, (ii) investment climate, and (iii) trade policy and capacity development. \nBesides advancing the policy reform agenda, a core objective of the program was capacity \ndevelopment  of  the  relevant  agencies,  and  staff  training  to  undertake  analytical  work  and \nstrengthen policy formulation. The program built on and continued ADB policy dialogue with the \ngovernment in this area, which has been ongoing since 2004. This contributed to a number of \nsignificant developments in recent years, including formulation of a new enterprise law, its \nimplementing  decrees  such  as  the  negative  list  for  enterprise  registration,  a  simplified \nregistration process, and piloted enterprise registry offices.  \n \n3.  Key features of the development program included (i) two single-tranche operations with \na well-defined, medium-term framework specified at the outset and including completion of high-\nimpact  reforms  prior  to  consideration  by  the  ADB  Board  of  Directors;  (ii) triggers  for  the \nsubsequent subprogram to support continuity of dialogue with the government, development \npartners, and other stakeholders; (iii) a limited number of well-targeted policy actions aimed at \nachieving high-impact outcomes regarding improvement of the enabling environment for private \nsector  development;  and  (iv)  the  post-program  partnership  framework  (P3F)  to  commit  to \ncontinued dialogue on microeconomic reforms. In this way, the program provided a coherent \nmedium-term reform strategy with two discrete but linked subprograms and a post-program \npolicy dialogue.  \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006.
