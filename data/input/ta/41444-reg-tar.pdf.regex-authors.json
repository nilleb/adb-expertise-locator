INTRODUCTION \n1.  The technical assistance (TA) will prepare a project to improve roads in the Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR)  and  Viet  Nam  comprising  part  of  the  Greater  Mekong \nSubregion (GMS)1 Northeastern Corridor. In January and February 2008, Asian Development \nBank (ADB) missions met with the Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MPWT) in the Lao \nPDR and the Viet Nam Road Administration (VRA) of the Ministry of Transport in Viet Nam, the \nproposed  executing  agencies,  to  discuss  the  TA  and  reach  an  agreement  on  its  impact, \noutcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of \nreference.2 The missions also conducted site visits to the project area. The TA and ensuing \ngrant for the Lao PDR and loan for Viet Nam are included in the Greater Mekong Subregion \nindicative rolling regional cooperation operations business plan (2008\u20132010).3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  One of the major impediments to building subregional economic cooperation is the poor \nstate of the basic infrastructure. Under the GMS Program, ADB is supporting the completion \nand  expansion  of  strategic  economic  corridors,  typically  centered  on  transport  corridors. \nDirection for a new transport sector strategy and program was provided by the GMS leaders at \nthe GMS summit in Kunming in July 2005. They highlighted the key economic development role \nof an efficient and comprehensive cross-border transport system in the GMS. In support of this, \nADB financed the preparation of a GMS transport sector strategy study.4 This stresses the \ncritical importance of completing transport corridors to link the subregion and promote trade and \ninvestment. It recommends that the overall objective should be the establishment of a well built, \nseamless, multi-modal subregional transport network to fully connect the GMS. The strategic \nobjectives include completing transport corridors to link the subregion and promote trade and \ninvestment; coordinating strategies to ensure that transport corridors evolve into economic \ncorridors, enabling agricultural diversification, industrialization, and the creation of employment \nopportunities; reducing nonphysical barriers to the movement of people, goods, and services; \nand accelerating the implementation of such arrangements as the GMS Cross-Border Transit \nAgreement.  \n \n3.  The GMS Northeastern Corridor (encompassing Nanning in Guangxi province, People\u2019s \nRepublic  of  China;  Hanoi  and  Thanh  Hoa  in  Viet  Nam;  Louangphrabang,  Lao  PDR;  and \nBangkok, Thailand) is one of the corridors identified in the transport sector strategy study and \nlinks northeastern Lao PDR and northern Viet Nam. Many of the roads in the transport corridor \nare  in  good  condition  or  are  being  improved.  For  example,  the  Northern  GMS  Transport \nNetwork Improvement Project,5 approved in 2007, is improving a 370 kilometer (km) section of \nthe Northeastern Corridor in the Lao PDR, specifically the section of Route 4 running southwest \nfrom the Louangphrabang area to the Lao PDR\u2013Thailand border. However, the sections of the \ncorridor in northeastern Lao PDR and northern Viet Nam need substantial improvement if they \nare to become part of a fully functioning transport corridor.6 The governments of the Lao PDR \n                                                 \n1  Cambodia, People\u2019s Republic of China, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 9 May 2008.  \n3  ADB. 2007.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the Lao      \nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic for the Northern Greater Mekong Subregion Transport Network Improvement Project. \nManila. \n6  The scope of the TA includes Route 217 in Thanh Hoa province in Viet Nam and sections of Routes 6, 6A, and 6B \nin Houaphanh Province in the Lao PDR. \n ", "2   \nand Viet Nam strongly support improvement of these roads to maximize the economic potential \nof the GMS Northeastern Corridor and to provide northern Lao PDR with year-round access to \nseaports.  \n \n4.  The  midterm  review  of  the  GMS  strategic  framework  (2002\u20132012) 7   found  that \ninvestments  in  physical  infrastructure  to  enable  connectivity  should  be  complemented  by \ninvestments that enhance competitiveness. This finding is relevant to the GMS Northeastern \nCorridor. The Lao PDR and Viet Nam have recently constructed new border posts at the Na \nMeo border crossing, which is at the junction of the Lao PDR Route 6 and Viet Nam Route 217, \nas well as at other border crossings in the project area. However, improvements in border-\ncrossing procedures and border controls are needed. ADB TA is helping to develop the GMS \ngovernments\u2019 capacity to manage cross-border transport and trade. The recently approved \nregional TA for Enhancing Transport and Trade Facilitation in the GMS8 will provide support for \ninstitutional capacity building to strengthen transport and trade facilitation, in order to maximize \nthe efficient movement of people and goods along the improved transport infrastructure in the \nGMS corridors. The TA consultants will work closely with regulatory agencies including customs \nand sanitary and phytosanitary agencies in the areas of transport facilitation; border inspection \nmeasures, including sanitary and phytosanitary measures; business and logistics support; and \nregional information sharing.  \n \n5.  Economic development and poverty reduction are key issues in the project area. The \nproject area is located in the provinces of Houaphanh in the Lao PDR and Thanh Hoa in Viet \nNam, both of which have high rates of poverty. Houaphanh in northeastern Lao PDR is one of \nthe poorest provinces in the country. Five of its eight districts are included among the 47 poorest \ndistricts of the Lao PDR, and 78% of Houaphanh\u2019s 758 villages are classified as poor, with the \nmajority of the population relying on upland agriculture. Thanh Hoa province is the northernmost \nprovince of Viet Nam\u2019s central coastal provinces. Three of the five districts of the province \nthrough  which  the  project  road  passes  are  designated  as  poor.  The  percentage  of  the \npopulation living below the poverty line in these three districts ranges from 24% to 59%. \n \n6.  ADB is implementing projects to facilitate economic growth and poverty reduction in \nspecific locations in the project area. In the Lao PDR project area, a Japan Fund for Poverty \nReduction (JFPR) grant for Alternative Livelihood for Upland Ethnic Groups in Houaphanh \nProvince9 aims to improve alternative sources of livelihood for ethnic groups in two districts. In \nthe Viet Nam project area, ADB-financed TA10 is currently preparing the proposed Thanh Hoa \nCity Comprehensive Socioeconomic Development Project. The TA will identify key strategic \nareas for the province and city\u2019s economic development by assisting in (i) finalizing the master \nplan for provincial and regional economic development; (ii) prioritizing investment proposals for \nthe city and the province on the basis of their impact on economic growth; and (iii) preparing \ninvestment  proposals  for  official  development  assistance,  private  sector  participation,  and \nstrengthening of small and medium-sized enterprises. In addition, a JFPR grant for the Thanh \nHoa Province Small Scale Infrastructure Investments and Services in Urban and Peri-Urban \n                                                 \n7  The review was carried out from November 2006 to June 2007, and endorsed by the GMS ministers at their \nmeeting in Manila on 21 June 2007. \n8  ADB.  2008.

Manila.  \n ", "  3\nAreas  is  also  being  implemented  in  Thanh  Hoa  province.11  The  grant  is  assisting  in  the \nimplementation of decentralized planning policies to bridge the gaps between centrally driven \nurban  service  networks  and  the  marginalized  urban  poor  through  a  community-driven \ndevelopment approach. The grant will provide local governments and community groups with \nthe capacity and skills necessary to implement decentralized and participatory infrastructure \nplanning activities. While these projects will improve economic conditions and reduce poverty in \ntheir specific project areas, broader economic growth in the project area will require better \ninfrastructure to improve links to ports and to other GMS areas that are growing more rapidly.  \n \n7.  The road sectors in the Lao PDR and Viet Nam are unable to fulfill their potential to \nfacilitate economic growth in their respective countries because of insufficient financing for road \nmaintenance,  inadequate  development  of  the  physical  transport  network,  and  insufficient \ncapacity  of  transport  sector  institutions.  In  the  Lao  PDR,  the  World  Bank  and  ADB  are \naddressing the insufficient financing for road maintenance through projects providing financing \nto the Road Maintenance Fund and technical assistance to improve its operations. The World \nBank, bilateral agencies (including Sweden, Republic of Korea, Thailand), ADB, and others \nhave  provided  financing  for  upgrading  the  national  road  network,  including  ADB-financed \nprojects to improve the GMS corridors. The World Bank, Sweden, ADB, and  others have \nprovided  financing  for  strengthening  the  capacity  of  transport  sector  institutions.  ADB  will \ncontinue this support through the proposed TA on Building Sector Program Readiness in the \nTransport Sector now being processed for approval in 2008. Consulting services to improve \nroad safety12 are also being provided under ADB road improvement projects. In Viet Nam, the \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation, the World Bank, and ADB have provided financing for \nimproving the national road network, including ADB-financed projects to improve the GMS \ncorridors. Maintenance of national roads is being supported by the World-Bank-funded Road \nNetwork Improvement Project,13 which has developed a standardized road maintenance system \nfor application to both national and provincial roads throughout Viet Nam. The Road Network \nImprovement Project includes a component for strengthening road maintenance financing and \nmanagement  that  will  prepare  and  implement  a  framework  to  improve  cost  recovery  and \nplanning, budgeting, and monitoring of maintenance of road assets. ADB\u2019s program for the \ntransport sector also includes a proposed TA for Capacity Development in the Transport Sector. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact of the Project will be more efficient transport infrastructure in the GMS \nNortheastern Corridor and the Lao PDR and Viet Nam national road networks. The TA outcome \nwill be the preparation of a project design and feasibility study for the Second Northern GMS \nTransport Network Improvement Project to a level suitable for ADB financing. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \n9.  By  improving  the  efficiency  of  transport  in  the  GMS  Northeastern  Corridor  and  on \nassociated rural access roads, the ensuing project will increase economic growth and reduce \npoverty in two of the poorer provinces of the Lao PDR and Viet Nam. The ensuing project will \nallow ADB to maximize the benefits of ongoing transport sector investments in the Northeastern \nCorridor. The project will also complement ongoing ADB-financed economic development and \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2007.

Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  A project design and feasibility study will be prepared for about 200 km of Route 217 in \nThanh Hoa province in Viet Nam and about 140 km of sections of Routes 6, 6A, and 6B in \nHouaphanh province in the Lao PDR. The study will also prioritize a total of about 200 km of \nrural access roads linking the corridor to the hinterland of the Lao PDR and Viet Nam. To \nprepare  the  project,  the  TA  will  (i)  prepare  traffic  forecasts  for  project  roads;  (ii) prepare \npreliminary designs and cost estimates; (iii) complete an economic analysis of the proposed \nroad improvements; (iv) analyze the environmental, social, resettlement, and  ethnic minority \nimpacts of the project and prepare an initial environmental examination and resettlement plan \nincluding  ethnic  minority  specific  actions;  (v)  prepare  the  necessary  documentation  for \napproval of the projects by the governments of the Lao PDR and Viet Nam; and (vi) analyze \nand recommend improvements for implementation of cross-border movement of goods and \npeople on the project roads.  \n \n11.  The ensuing project is not expected to have any major negative environmental, social, or \nresettlement impact, as it consists of improvements to roads along existing alignments, with only \nlimited use of new alignments to improve safety conditions. None of the roads passes through \nenvironmentally protected areas. The initial poverty and social analysis is in Appendix 2. The TA \nwill include a full analysis of potential impacts and preparation of plans for mitigating them. The \nprimary resettlement and land acquisition impact is expected to be the acquisition of narrow \nstrips of land along the road alignment, with the relocation of a small number of households in \nthe few places where adjustments to the alignment may be necessary. Many members of ethnic \nminorities live in parts of the project area. The concentration of ethnic minority populations is \nhighest in the areas closest to the Lao PDR\u2013Viet Nam border, and they are less integrated into \nmainstream society in these areas as well. Ethnic minorities are expected to benefit significantly \nfrom the project, as will the population in general. The stakeholder consultation carried out and \nthe resettlement plan prepared under the TA will include components to ensure that ethnic \nminorities are not disadvantaged by the project and they and other vulnerable groups will be \nassisted to improve their socioeconomic status. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,600,000 equivalent. The governments of the \nLao PDR and Viet Nam have asked ADB to provide $1,300,000 equivalent to be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The governments \nwill finance the balance of $300,000 equivalent by each providing $150,000 equivalent to cover \nthe required office accommodation, remuneration and per diem for counterpart staff, and other \nitems, mostly in kind. The governments have been informed that approval of the TA does not \ncommit ADB to finance any ensuing project. The cost estimates and financing plan for the TA \nare in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  The executing agencies for the project will be the Lao PDR MPWT and the VRA under \nthe  Ministry  of  Transport.  Both  MPWT  and  VRA  have  the  capacity  to  implement  the  TA \nsuccessfully,  as  demonstrated  by  their  prior  experience  with  ADB-financed  projects.  The \nimplementing agencies for the project will be MPWT\u2019s Department of Roads (DOR) for the \n ", "  5\nLao PDR and VRA\u2019s Project Management Unit 1 (PMU1) for Viet Nam. The directors-general \nof DOR and PMU1 will be responsible for implementation of the TA in the Lao PDR and Viet \nNam,  respectively.  The  governments  will  set  up  a  steering  committee  to  oversee  and \ncoordinate all TA activities. The steering committee will be chaired jointly by the director-\ngenerals of DOR and PMU1 and will be composed of representatives from other ministries \nand  agencies  of  the  national  and  local  governments  of  both  countries.  The  steering \ncommittee will meet periodically in Vientiane and Ha Noi. The governments will make a team \nof counterpart staff available to help the consultants carry out the TA in a timely manner. The \nexecuting agencies will provide office accommodation, local communication facilities, office \nsupport staff, and other administrative support. Project offices will be located in Vientiane and \nHa Noi. \n \n14.  An international consulting firm in association with national consultants will be selected \nand engaged by ADB, using the quality- and cost-based selection method with a quality\u2013cost \nweighting of 80:20. ADB will apply its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time) in engaging consultants. The full technical proposal procedure will be used to \nselect the consultants. A total of about 26 person-months of international and 84 person-months \nof national consulting services will be required. The consultants will have extensive experience \nin  (i)  highway,  bridge,  and  pavement  engineering;  (ii) traffic  forecasting  for  and  economic \nevaluation  of  road  projects;  (iii)  environmental,  resettlement,  social,  and  poverty  impact \nassessments, including ethnic minority issues; and (iv) transport sector and border-crossing \ninstitutional  issues.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for  the  consultants  are  in  Appendix  4. \nAdvance action for recruitment of consultants has been approved. \n \n15.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  about  8  months,  beginning  in  October  2008  for \ncompletion by May 2009. The consultants will submit (i) an inception report within 1 month of \ncommencing their services; (ii) an interim report within 3 months; (iii) a draft final report within  \n6 months including the environmental, social, and poverty impact assessment reports and \nresettlement plan; and (iv) a final report within 3 weeks of receipt of comments from the \ngovernments and ADB. Tripartite meetings will be held after submission of the inception, interim, \nand draft final reports to review and endorse the reports. The location of the meetings will \nalternate between Vientiane and Ha Noi. The consultants will conduct workshops to discuss \nissues arising during the preparation of the interim and draft final reports, with two workshops \neach in Vientiane and Ha Noi. Equipment to be provided under the TA will be procured in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Office \nequipment purchased will be transferred to the executing agencies upon completion of the TA, \nand thereafter will remain the property of the governments.   \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,300,000.00 on a grant basis \nfor Preparing the Second Northern Greater Mekong Subregion Transport Network Improvement \nProject, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n  Performance  Data Sources and/or   \nDesign  Targets and/or  Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \nTransport  1.

POVERTY ISSUES \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \nBased on the country poverty assessment, the country partnership strategy and the sector analysis describe how the \nproject would directly or indirectly contribute to poverty reduction and how it is linked to the poverty reduction strategy \nof the partner country. \n \nBoth the Lao PDR and Viet Nam recognize the importance of regional cooperation in facilitating economic growth and \nreducing poverty. The Government of the Lao PDR has identified transport development as critical to achieving its \ndevelopment targets. The 2004 national growth and poverty eradication strategy states that the primary goal for \ntransport is to \u201cfully integrate the economy, thereby providing an enabling environment for trade and commerce and \naccess for all Lao people to basic services\u201d. Poverty reduction is a key focus of the Government\u2019s current and long-\nterm (2020) development plan. Road access is considered one of the keys to eradicating poverty in the Lao PDR. \nViet Nam\u2019s socio-economic development program (2006\u20132010) is based on a strategy for pro-poor growth and \npoverty reduction. Viet Nam\u2019s rapid reduction in poverty to date has arisen from its high rates of economic growth. To \ncontinue this progress, improvement of transport infrastructure is necessary, particularly in areas without easy access \nto major centers of economic activity. \n \nB.     Targeting Classification  \n1.  Select the targeting classification of the project: \n \n General Intervention (GI)   Individual or Household (TI-H);  Geographic (TI-G);  Non-Income MDGs (TI-M1, \nM2, etc.) \n \n2.   Explain the basis for the targeting classification:  \n \nThe TA will design a project that will reduce poverty by increasing economic growth for all residents of the project \narea as well as for people in the larger GMS region. The benefits of the project arising from improved transport \ninfrastructure on the GMS Northeastern Corridor are available to all people regardless of income level. \n \nC.  Poverty Analysis \n1.  If the project is classified as TI-H, or if it is policy-based, what type of poverty impact analysis is needed?  \n \n2. What resources are allocated in the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA)/due diligence? \n \nThe TA includes international and national consulting services for poverty analysis as well as financing for conducting \nsocial surveys which will include collection of data for the poverty analysis. \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  9 \n \n3.  If GI, is there any opportunity for pro-poor design (e.g., social inclusion subcomponents, cross subsidy, pro-poor \ngovernance, and pro-poor growth)? \n \nThe scope of the TA includes rural access roads to maximize benefits for the rural poor (see below).  The social \nanalysis to be conducted under the TA will determine if there are additional opportunities for pro-poor design. \n \nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \nA.  Initial Social Analysis \n \nBased on existing information: \n1.  Who are the potential primary beneficiaries of the project? How do the poor and the socially excluded benefit \nfrom the project? \n \nThe potential primary beneficiaries of the project include the residents of Houaphanh province in the Lao PDR and \nThanh Hoa province in Viet Nam, both of which have high rates of poverty. Houaphanh province in northeastern Lao \nPDR is one of the poorest provinces in the country. Five of its eight districts are included among the 47 poorest \ndistricts of the Lao PDR, and 78% of Houaphanh\u2019s 758 villages are classified as poor with the majority of the \npopulation relying on upland agriculture. Thanh Hoa province is the northernmost province of Viet Nam\u2019s central \ncoastal provinces. Three of the five districts of the province through which the project road passes are designated as \npoor. The percentage of the population living below the poverty line in these three districts ranges from 24% to 59%. \nBy improving the efficiency of transport in the GMS Northeastern Corridor and on associated rural access roads, the \nproject prepared by the TA will provide opportunities for the poor and socially excluded to gain access to employment \nand trading opportunities arising from increased economic growth in the project area. \n \n2.  What are the potential needs of beneficiaries in relation to the proposed project? \n \nThe primary need is access to areas of the GMS with higher rates of economic growth and to markets for agricultural \nand other products produced in the project area. \n \n3.  What are the potential constraints on accessing the proposed benefits and services, and how will the project \naddress them? \n \nPoor access of remote communities to the roads comprising the GMS Northeastern Corridor could restrict the \nresidents of these communities from benefiting from the ensuing project. The scope of the TA includes selection and \ndesign of improvement options for about 200 km of rural access roads (covering both countries) to ensure that people \nliving in remote communities can benefit from the project.  \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1. Indicate the potential initial stakeholders. \n \nThe potential initial stakeholders include people living in communities along the road; people in the project area, \nparticularly farmers and producers of other goods that can be sold in markets; and road users, who will benefit from \nthe completion of the GMS Northeastern Corridor\u2019s linking of northern Lao PDR and northern Viet Nam, including \nThanh Hoa.  \n \n2. What type of consultation and participation is required during the PPTA or project processing (e.g., workshops, \ncommunity mobilization, involvement of nongovernment organizations and community-based organizations, etc.)? \n \nDuring the TA, consultation will be carried out with stakeholders, including holding workshops for ethnic minorities \nand other residents of the project area and discussions with non-government organizations active in the project area.  \n \n3. What level of participation is envisaged for project design? \n     Information sharing     Consultation         Collaborative decision making         Empowerment \n4. Will a consultation and participation plan be prepared?    Yes          No    Please explain.  \n \n ", "10  Appendix 2 \n \nC.  Gender and Development \n1. What are the key gender issues in the sector and/or subsector that are likely to be relevant to this project or \nprogram? \n \nThe improvement of the roads that comprise the GMS Northeastern Corridor will create new opportunities for \nwomen through jobs, small businesses, and better access to social services. However, the extent to which women \ncan take advantage of these opportunities depends on economic, social, and cultural factors. The improved roads \nand increased traffic pose an increased risk for trafficking of women and children as well as HIV/AIDS transmission. \nThe TA will conduct a gender analysis and, if necessary, prepare a gender strategy targeted at households affected \nby resettlement and communities that are at risk of increased HIV/AIDS transmission and human trafficking. The \ngender strategy will help women from affected households secure better access to compensation resources and \nlivelihood activities under the resettlement plan, and will minimize the potential risk of HIV/AIDS and human \ntrafficking in the communities. \n \n2.  Does  the  proposed  project  or  program  have  the  potential  to  promote  gender  equality  and/or  women\u2019s \nempowerment  by  improving  women\u2019s  access  to  and  use  of  opportunities,  services,  resources,  assets,  and \nparticipation in decision making?       Yes          No    Please explain.  \n      The project will improve women\u2019s access to employment opportunities and social services. \n \n3. Could the proposed project have an adverse impact on women and/or girls or widen gender inequality? \n          Yes          No     The project will improve existing roads, and it is not expected to have any adverse \nimpact on women and/or girls or to widen gender inequality. The social analysis \nunder the TA will confirm the nature of the impact. \n \nIII.
