INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Charter  requires  staff  to  \u201ctake  the  necessary \nmeasures to ensure that the proceeds of any loan made, guaranteed or participated in by the \nBank are used J with due attention to considerations of economy and efficiency.\u201d It also states \nthat \u201conly economic considerations shall be relevant to their decisions.\u201d1 At the same time, ADB \nfinancing is shifting to more complex development challenges as developing member countries \n(DMCs)  move  toward  upper  middle-income  status.  Many  of  these  challenges  will  require \ninnovative and catalytic investments that span multiple sectors, or that generate nonmarket \nbenefits, which will make quantification for economic analysis more difficult. Meanwhile, project \npreparation  is  expected  to  be  faster  and  leaner,  putting  pressure  on  those  undertaking \neconomic analysis to deliver timely information to support investment decisions. In this context, \nit is critical to strengthen the capacity of DMC executing agencies to deliver appropriate and \nrigorous economic analyses. The proposed regional capacity development technical assistance \n(TA) aims to overcome this constraint by providing focused capacity building to relevant officials \nin  DMCs  and  jointly  developing  economic  analyses  of  selected  innovative  projects  in \ncollaboration with regional departments. The TA will also formulate and/or update economic \nanalysis methodologies for new and more complex projects that DMCs plan to implement. A \nconcept  paper  prepared  for  the  TA  was  approved  by  the  vice-president  (knowledge \nmanagement and sustainable development) on 29 September 2016. The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Recent  trends  show  that  ADB  has  been  receiving  more  demand  for  financing  for \ninnovative and catalytic projects from its DMCs. The Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 reaffirms \nthat knowledge and capacity building are the key pillars in ADB\u2019s strategy of engaging its \nDMCs.3 This trend is expected to intensify as more ADB DMCs move toward upper middle-\nincome status, and the nature of ADB project financing will shift toward tackling more complex \ndevelopment challenges faced by its DMCs, including projects associated with urbanization, \nclimate change, regional integration, and value chain development. Anticipating this trend, the \nPresident, on 21 April 2016, issued guidance on the inclusion of high-level technology in the \ndesign of ADB projects to help meet the DMC challenges.4  \n \n3.   At the same time, a strong effort was made to introduce greater flexibility in ADB\u2019s \nlending  modalities,  including  the  use  of  results-based  lending  whereby  the  assistance  is \nassessed and processed following the DMC\u2019s own system for processing and implementation.5 \nUsing this modality, the DMC will increasingly conduct most of the design activities of the project \nand undertake the required due diligence such as safeguards, governance, and financial and \neconomic viability. Development partners will assist in the implementation of a DMC\u2019s sector \nstrategy and investment plan, with financial assistance contingent upon the achievement of \npredetermined results. This approach reduces transaction costs and introduces greater flexibility, \n                                                \n1   ADB. 1965. Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank. Manila (Articles 14.11 and 36.2). \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 10 October 2016.  \n3   ADB. 2014. Midterm Review of Strategy 2020: Meeting the Challenges of a Transforming Asia and Pacific. Manila. \n4  Memo dated 21 April 2016 issued by the President to the Vice Presidents on Use of High Level Technology in \nProjects. \n5  Results-based lending is an ADB financing modality that was approved in March 2013 on a pilot basis for an initial \n6 years. Results-based lending is a performance-based form of financing, in which disbursements are linked to the \nachievement of results rather than to up-front expenditures, as is the case with traditional investment lending. \n \n ", "2 \n \nbut for it to function effectively, recipient countries must have the capacity to conduct a rigorous \nassessment  of  the  viability  of  the  proposed  projects  and  other  interventions.  In  addition, \npreparatory  activities  for  some  of  the  mainstreamed  modalities\u2014e.g.,  sector  projects  and \nmultitranche financing facilities\u2014often include due diligence only for a sample of investments \nand subprojects, and due diligence for the remaining investments and subprojects is expected \nto be undertaken by the executing or implementing agencies during implementation.  \n \n4.  While ADB\u2019s new financing modalities imply greater reliance on DMCs\u2019 capacities for \nproject preparation, the capacities for the conduct of due diligence, particularly for economic and \nfinancial analysis, vary greatly among the DMCs. An informal survey by ADB during the update \nof the Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects found that only a handful of DMCs have \nestablished processes and capacities for the conduct of economic due diligence.6 In most DMCs, \nthe methodology applied is limited and needs to be updated and further developed. In particular, \nrecent development issues such as the impacts of high-level technology, climate change, and \nother externalities, and the need to include these in the project design are rarely considered in \nthe economic analysis of the proposed investments. The survey also found that a large number \nof DMCs mostly rely on ADB and other development partners\u2019 project preparatory processes for \nthe assessment of economic and financial due diligence. DMCs\u2019 weak capacities for conducting \nrigorous economic and financial assessments in their planning limit the potential benefits from \nthe new development assistance modalities, and can offset the gains from lower transaction \ncosts associated with processing and implementing investment projects. \n \n5.  Increasing DMCs\u2019 demand for innovative and catalytic projects will require continued \nrefinement of the techniques used in the economic analysis of ADB projects. While the main \nprinciples of economic analysis remain valid, their application to innovative and multisector \nprojects, and projects with nonmarket benefits will require continued methodological adjustment \nand refinement to ensure relevance and practicality. At the same time, continued research is \nneeded to update the key parameters now used in conducting project-related economic analysis \nso as to improve its efficiency and ensure consistency of its application.  \n \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The impact will be more efficient resource allocation by DMC governments achieved. \nThe outcome will be the increased use of economic analysis in investment selection and design \nby DMC officials.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n7.  The TA will have two main outputs: \n (i)  Output 1: Capacity development. This output will focus on building the capacity \nof DMC officials and institutions responsible for the conduct of economic due \ndiligence to support their investment planning. Key activities are as follows: (a) \ntraining or capacity building in the general principles of economic analysis; and (b) \ndemonstration of good-practice economic analyses for selected innovative and \ncomplex investment projects in collaboration with DMCs, regional departments, \n                                                \n6  ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila.  \n \n ", "  3\nand sector and thematic groups (STGs). Output 1a will provide basic training on \neconomic  analysis  to  relevant  DMC  officials.  Output  1b  will  deepen  their \nunderstanding through the application of economic analysis in innovative ADB \ninvestments. Where possible, the TA will forge partnerships with universities, \nthink tanks, and centers of excellence (COEs) in the DMCs in imparting capacity-\nbuilding activities. Such partnerships will expand the current thin skill pool in the \nfield and support the sustainability of the TA output in the medium term.  \n (ii)  Output 2: Guidance materials for improved economic analysis. Activities will \ncover research on special topics to improve the analytical rigor and quality of \neconomic analysis in various sectors, including (a) a practical and user-friendly \nguidance note on analytical techniques not yet applied at ADB, such as valuation \nof  greenhouse  gas  emissions  in  collaboration  with  ADB\u2019s  Sustainable \nDevelopment  and  Climate  Change  Department,  new  nonmarket  valuation \ntechniques, welfare modeling, and other topics relating to economic analysis, as \nrequested by DMC governments through the regional departments or STGs;  \n(b)  an  economic  analysis  of  other  lending  modalities,  such  as  policy-based \nand/or results-based  lending;  and  (c) the  development  of  economic analysis \nguidance materials for specific sectors, which can be readily used by the DMC \nofficials and may draw on demonstration cases from output 1. The practical \nguidance notes will supplement the Revised Guidelines on Economic Analysis of \nInvestment Projects, expected to be approved by December 2016.7 In some \ncases,  they  will  be  developed  in  conjunction  with  the  preparation  of \ndemonstration economic analyses under output 1a. In other cases, they can be \ndeveloped separately in collaboration with regional departments and STGs. As \nregards the economic analysis of policy-based and/or results-based lending, the \npractice currently varies across regional departments. The guidance notes for the \neconomic analysis of policy-based and/or results-based lending will synthesize \nthe current good practice in ADB and supplement it with other good practice in \nother multilateral development banks such as the World Bank and the Inter-\nAmerican  Development  Bank.  Selected  guidance  notes  will  be  prepared  in \ncollaboration  with  regional  departments  to  strengthen  DMCs\u2019  capacity  in \nformulating and evaluating their key policy reforms. Appendix 4 presents an \nindicative outline of the tentative topics under output 2. \n \n8.        Key risks identified for the project include (i) high turnover of DMC officials in the \nplanning ministries or executing and/or implementing agencies, which may affect ownership and \ncontinuation of TA-supported activities after TA completion; and (ii) lack of sufficient funds for \nDMC  governments  to  implement  and  continue  the  conduct  of  economic  analysis  after  TA \ncompletion. Mitigation measures will include capacity-building activities that will target DMC \nofficials in both planning and key executing and implementing agencies, and relevant think \nthanks and COEs to help build critical mass. The TA will also provide easier access to economic \nassessment  guidelines  and  guidance  notes  for  DMC  officials,  including  by  making  them \navailable in selected local languages.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n9.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). Appendix 2 presents the cost estimates \nand financing plan. \n                                                \n7  ADB. Forthcoming. Revised Guidelines on Economic Analysis of Investment Projects. Manila. \n ", "4 \n \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n10.   The  TA  will  have  a  2-year  implementation  period  starting  in  December  2016.  The \ncounterpart agencies in the respective DMCs will be the planning and sector agencies that are \ntasked with planning, designing, and assessing individual investment proposals or investment \nplans that comprise competing or complementing investment proposals. However, counterpart \nagencies will not be required to provide any material support to the implementation of the TA \nactivities. \n \n11.   ADB will be the executing agency, and the Economic Analysis and Operations Support \nDivision (EREA) of the Economic Research and Regional Cooperation Department will be the \nfocal point. EREA will coordinate closely with the DMCs, regional departments, and STGs in \ndelivering capacity-building activities. ADB will obtain a written confirmation of no objection \nbefore commencing and financing the proposed activities in the selected DMCs.  The selection \nof the projects to be included in output 1b for the demonstration of good-practice economic \nanalyses of projects will be based on (i) the relevance of particular projects for the application of \nnew economic analysis techniques, (ii) the replicability of the project examples for other future \neconomic analyses, and (iii) balance across the ADB region and sector portfolio. Potential \nassistance will be assessed on a first-come first-served basis, considering the distributional \nbalance  across  regional  departments.  The  Economic  Research  and  Regional  Cooperation \nDepartment will regularly conduct consultation meetings with regional departments and STGs to \ndiscuss and agree on the topics to be undertaken for the methodological research. Similarly, \nEREA will plan with the regional departments the schedule, location, and content of the training \nworkshops based on the needs of their respective DMCs. EREA also plans to coordinate with \nCOEs or selected research institutions in DMCs the implementation of TA components where \npossible. The draft studies and/or reports will be discussed and peer-reviewed internally and \nexternally (as needed) and workshops will be organized as needed to finalize them. EREA will \nalso coordinate with respective ADB departments and DMC planning and sector agencies on \nthe dissemination of TA outputs. \n \n12.  The TA will require the services of international and national experts, including project \neconomists,  sector  economists,  and  publication  and  research  assistants.  Since  the  actual \nrequired type of expertise and length of inputs will become clear only during the implementation \nof the TA outputs, it is not possible to quantify them exactly at this time, although an estimate \nfor some of the experts is provided (Appendix 3). Any planned collaboration with COEs and \nDMC  research  institutions  through  knowledge  partnerships  will  be  coordinated  with  the \nKnowledge Sharing and Services Center of the Sustainable Development and Climate Change \nDepartment. Since the TA will require rapid mobilization of consultants where the consultants\u2019 \nexperience  and  qualifications  are  the  primary  consideration,  engagement  of  individual \nconsultants will be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, \nas amended from time to time) and with ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook \n(2010, as amended from time to time).8 In addition, procurement of equipment will be done in \naccordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time).9 \n \n                                                \n8  To the extent possible, lumpsum payments and/or output-based contracts will be considered for consulting \nservices in line with ADB. 2014.

The TA will conduct several national and regional capacity-building and dissemination \nworkshops. Major reports, training materials, and case studies will also be disseminated through \nthe ADB website. Partnerships with universities, research institutions, and COEs will be another \nkey channel of dissemination. \n  \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n14.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis \nfor Strengthening the Conduct of Economic Analysis of Project and Program Investments in \nDeveloping Member Countries, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the TA  is aligned with \nAchievement of more efficient resource allocation by DMC governments  \n  Performance Indicators \nwith Targets and  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Baselines  Reporting  Risks \nOutcome       \nUse of economic  a.
