I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan, (ii) proposed administration of a loan to be provided by the ADB Clean Technology Fund \n(ADB CTF), and (iii) proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the ADB CTF, to the \nRepublic  of  the  Philippines  for  the  Market  Transformation  through  Introduction  of  Energy-\nEfficient Electric Vehicles Project.1 \n \n2.  The  proposed  project  will  replace  100,000  gasoline  tricycles  (motorcycles  with  a \npassenger sidecar) with three wheel plug-in electric vehicles running on an electric motor and \nrechargeable battery (e-trikes). The project will initiate a transformation of the tricycle subsector \nby (i) improving the livelihoods of tricycle drivers through higher incomes and a better work \nenvironment; (ii) generating global environmental benefits and reducing the carbon footprint of \nthe  tricycle  industry  through  the  introduction  of  low-carbon,  e-trike  technology;  and  (iii) \nleveraging private sector participation in the e-trike market. The Government of the Philippines \nplans  to  introduce  clean  and  efficient  energy  technology,  provide  affordable  financing \nmodalities, generate demand, develop technical capacity, create support infrastructure, and \nallocate new technology risk to the suppliers. The government will target selected cities in Metro \nManila and other urban centers where tricycles are widely used. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  In 2011, the Philippines spent about $12.8 billion (29% more than in 2010) on imported \npetroleum products; 70% of the imports went to the transport sector.2 This heavy dependence \non imported fuels renders the country vulnerable to energy supply disruptions and global price \nfluctuations. The cost of fuel imports is expected to rise further as the population continues to \ngrow rapidly and urbanization increases. With motorization growing at about 6% per year, \nemissions from road transport are estimated to rise from 24 million tons of carbon dioxide \nequivalent (tCO e) in 2007 to 37 million tCO e by 2015 and 87 million tCO e by 2030. This will \n2 2 2\nfurther deteriorate the country\u2019s air-quality and energy security, and increase the Philippines\u2019 \ncarbon footprint. The National Framework Strategy on Climate Change, 2010\u201320223 considers \na low-carbon path in the transport sector a strategic priority. It argues for cleaner, indigenous, \nand optimized energy and transport sectors to enable the Philippines to address its energy \nsecurity while reducing pollution. \n \n4.  Transport is central to connecting people and economic centers both nationally and \nlocally.  In  2010,  according  to  the  Philippines\u2019  Department  of  Energy  (DOE),  using  Land \nTransport Office\u2019s vehicles statistics, 92% of the transport sector\u2019s fuel consumption was by \nroad transport. Although public vehicles represent only about 15% of road transport, they are \nmajor fuel users and cause most of the transport pollution\u2014tricycles account for 67%, followed \nby jeepneys4 (23%), cars (4%) and buses (6%). The 3.5 million tricycles currently operating are \nmajor contributors of greenhouse gas emissions and inefficient users of imported fuel. Although \nlocal government units (LGUs) regulate the number of tricycles, this will rise as motorcycle sales \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Government of the Philippines, Department of Energy. http://www.doe.gov.ph/DO/Report2011.htm \n3  Government of the Philippines. 2010. The National Framework Strategy on Climate Change, 2010\u20132022, Manila. \nhttp://climate.gov.ph \n4  Jeepneys were initially made from left behind World War II military Jeeps as means of public transport. This has \nnow evolved into a locally fabricated vehicle for public transport.    ", "2 \nincrease. About 1 million motorcycles are expected to be sold domestically in 2012, nearly a \nthird more than the 760,000 units sold in 2010. \n \n5.  The International Energy Agency considers electric vehicles as one of the best options \nfor the transport sector, especially in urban areas.5 Recent studies by the Clean Air Initiatives for \nAsian  Cities  estimate  that  switching  to  e-trikes  will  reduce  the  greenhouse  gas  impact  of \ntricycles by 54%.6 International studies also point to similar savings.7 Tricycles are a popular \nmode of local transport in the Philippines and are run entirely by the private sector. In many \ncases, they provide a vital link as a local feeder service to the larger-public transport network. \nAlthough the government has banned the importation of two-stroke motorcycles8 the existing \ntwo-stroke engines are easy to fix and continue to be used in tricycles. Isolated initiatives since \n2009 to develop an e-vehicle industry\u2014e-trikes, e-jeepneys, and e-buses\u2014mostly used lead-\nacid or substandard lithium-ion batteries because of cost considerations and  limited brand \navailability.  \n \n6.  In April 2011, ADB and DOE piloted, 20 locally made e-trikes powered by imported \nlithium-ion batteries in Mandaluyong,9 a city in Metro Manila. Collectively, the e-trikes have \ntraveled more than 600,000 kilometers (km) in 20 months, and the pilot project have collected a \nnet total of $16,000 as drivers\u2019 daily \u2015lease\u2016 payments. Surveys from the pilot-testing showed \nthat e-trike operators carried more passengers, implying higher turnover and daily income. By \nswitching fuels, the  e-trike  operators  doubled their  average  daily  net  income to  $17.  This \nadditional income will help with loan repayments for a new e-trike in the future. Driver feedback \non the handling and operating of an e-trike has been used in designing an improved model for \nthe proposed scale up. \n \n7.  Although the drivers and passengers are satisfied with the performance of the pilot units, \nkeeping all 20 operating has been a challenge.10 Problems include (i) a lack of reliable spare \nparts, (ii) inadequate technical skills to repair and maintain the motors and batteries, and (iii) \nconcerns over the battery life beyond the second year as the pilot project was unable to secure \nbatteries from reputable brands. The lessons from the pilot project confirmed the need for \nsignificant  scaling  up  to  ensure  the  sustainability  of  the  e-vehicle  initiative  and  to  attract \nreputable e-vehicle and battery technology holders to the Philippines. To scale-up the program, \ne-trike manufacturing and maintenance will have to be localized to ensure that the need for after \nsales services, repairs, spare parts, and battery warranties are met. Development of a local e-\ntrike industry will help minimize technology risk, broaden the adoption of e-vehicles, and create \njobs.  The  government  has  started  scaling  up  of  the  pilot  project11 to  establish  a  viable, \nsustainable, local e-vehicle industry with the participation of several local and international e-\ntrike  manufacturers.  In response  to  this  initiative,  several  reputable global  battery  and  car \nmanufacturers have expressed interest in investing in the country.  \n \n                                                \n5  International Energy Agency.

With  about  3.5  million  tricycles  currently  operating  and  a  growing  number  of  new \ntricycles being registered, a transformation of the industry to clean technology e-trikes will take \ntime. The  e-trikes  are expected  to  be  introduced  largely  through  substitution  for gasoline- \npowered units (i.e. non-incremental). This is expected to be followed by generated demand from \nnew entrants to the e-trike market as the affordable clean technology becomes more widely \navailable. A survey of local governments found an immediate demand for more than 130,000 e-\ntrikes. Based on this interest, the government plans to initially scale-up the project to 100,000 \nunits in a phased manner, in order to create an environment conducive to the manufacture, \ndistribution and after-sale support of the e-trikes. As the private sector gains a foothold in the \nsupply and maintenance market for e-trikes, the government\u2019s involvement will shrink.   \n \n9.  The introduction of e-trikes with lithium-ion battery technology is also expected to pave \nthe way for higher safety standards and improved environmental compliance. The proposed e-\nvehicle project complements the government\u2019s plans to support e-vehicle businesses.12 To \npursue this transformation, the government has secured a $5 million grant and $100 million \nconcessional loan from the CTF. The project is consistent with DOE\u2019s Fueling Sustainable \nTransport Program,13 and with ADB\u2019s Energy Policy 2009 (promotes projects to support energy \nsecurity needs and transition to a low-carbon economy) and sustainable transport initiative14 \n(focuses on transport systems that are accessible, safe, affordable, and environment-friendly). \nThe promotion of energy-efficient transportation is part of the ADB\u2019s current country partnership \nstrategy15 for Philippines, and the program is in the country operations business plan, 2012\u2013\n2014.16  \n \n10.  The market for new e-trike technology to replace existing tricycles and meet generated \ndemand is potentially large given the rapid growth of the industry. To initiate the government\u2019s \nplan to transform the industry through e-trike technology, the project must capture economies of \nscale by ensuring that the supply of e-trike technology and services is cost effective and meets \naggregate as well as diverse local demand and conditions. The design of the e-trike has \nevolved through the pilot phase to cater to a range of conditions in the Philippines. The selected \ne-trike design uses a standard, high-quality lithium-ion battery and higher safety standard, which \nis expected to result in cost-effective market entry for national and international investors, \nincluding reputable e-vehicle producers and components manufacturers. It will also facilitate \ncost-effective after sales service. Successfully establishing the industry in the Philippines will \nalso create jobs beyond the e-trike operators and has the potential for growth into other South \nand Southeast Asian markets. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact of the project will be sustainable energy use by the transport sector. The \noutcome will be the transformation of public transportation through large-scale adoption of \nlocally made energy-efficient electric vehicles, in particular e-trikes.  \n                                                \n12 Senate Committee Report No. 44 on Senate Bill No. 285\u2013Electric.

The  project  will  deliver  100,000  complete  e-trike  units  to \nselected cities or municipalities to replace gasoline tricycles, with a comprehensive warranty on \nbatteries and mechanical parts to ensure technical reliability and after-sales service.  \n \n14.  Output 2: Battery supply chain. The project will initiate creation of a lithium-ion battery \nsupply chain by procuring at least 300 MWh of lithium ion batteries for the 100,000 e-trikes.  \n    \n15.  Output 3: Solar and grid-connected charging stations. The project will (i) pilot five \noff-grid solar charging stations, 200 kilo Watts each, sufficient to meet the demand of 1,000 e-\ntrikes; and (ii) establish grid-connected charging stations. Some pilot solar charging stations will \nbe in island locations outside the main grid that are easily accessible and plan to adopt large \nnumber of e-trikes.  \n \n16.  Output  4:  Materials  recovery.  A mechanism will be established for collecting and \ndisposing existing passenger sidecars of tricycles and spent lithium-ion batteries.   \n \n17.  Output  5:  Communication,  social  mobilization,  and  technology  transfer.  All \nstakeholders will be educated about the project\u2019s benefits, technical parameters, costs, and \nmarket potential of e-trikes. This will include training the drivers on the use and maintenance of \ne-trikes and technical training for other stakeholders to develop human resources to support the \ndevelopment of the local industry.   \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n18.  The project is estimated to cost $504 million (Table 1). The government has requested a \nloan of $300 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the project. The loan \nwill have a 20-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, and a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per annum, and such other terms and conditions as set forth in \nthe draft loan and project agreements. The government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons \nfor its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility based on these terms and \nconditions and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not \nmade  based  on  any  communication  or  advice from  ADB.  Based  on such  loan terms  and \nrepayment method, the average loan maturity is 12.75 years and there is no maturity premium \npayable to ADB. \n \n19.  The CTF will cofinance the project with a grant of $5 million and a loan of $100 million, \nwith a 40-year term, including a grace period of 10 years, a management fee of 0.18% per \nannum on the undisbursed balance of the loan, and an interest charge of 0.25%. ADB will \nadminister  the  CTF  funds.  ADB  and  CTF  loans  will  finance  the  financial  charges  during \nconstruction.  The  government  will  finance  the  remaining  $99  million,  including  taxes  and \ncontingency amounts for the e-trikes. \n   \n ", "5 \nTable 1: Project Investment Plana \n($ million)  \nItem  Total \nA.

Implementation Arrangements \n20.  The project will be implemented over 60 months from January 2013 to December 2017. \nIt will have two phases: an industry development phase (24\u201330 months) when the initial 20,000 \ne-trikes will be procured and distributed, and (ii) a scale-up phase (30\u221236 months) when the \nremaining  80,000  units  will  be  procured  and  distributed.  ADB  and  DOE  will  conduct  a \ncomprehensive midterm assessment of the project, which will include options for expanding into \nother public e-vehicles, before implementing phase 2.  \n ", "6 \n21.  DOE will be the executing agency responsible for procurement, overall implementation,  \nand technical supervision of the project. DOE will manage the supply and service contracts of \nthe  suppliers.  DOE  has  established  E-Trike  Group,  which  will  become  the  e-trike  project \nmanagement unit, and will include DOE staff, supported by implementation consultants with \ntechnical expertise. It will directly manage and supervise implementation of the project.  \n \n22.  Prior to the distribution of e-trikes, a government financial institution (GFI) with existing \nlending operations in the municipalities, such as the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP), will \nestablish a loan facility with the LGU to cover the cost of the e-trikes. The government will enter \ninto a separate agreement with the GFI on the financial terms of the loans from GFI to each \nselected LGU. The LGU will take the driver\u2019s credit risk as they are in a better position to \nassume such risk. The choice of the GFI may vary depending on the municipality and GFI\u2019s \ninterest, availability of retail branch in local area, etc. The e-trikes will be distributed in three \nsteps:  (i)  ADB  will  pay  the  competitively  selected  suppliers  directly  upon  DOE\u2019s  request \n(withdrawal  application),  (ii)  the  supplier  will  deliver  the  e-trike  to  the  LGU  concerned  in \naccordance with an agreed upon schedule, and (iii) the LGU\u2019s e-trike office will distribute the e-\ntrikes to drivers pre-selected based on a transparent lottery with priority to two stroke tricycles.  \n  \n23.  The collected funds from the drivers and payment back to government will also involve \nthree steps: (i) the drivers will pay a daily amount as part of the \u2015lease to own\u2016 scheme either to \nthe e-trike office, or to a bank account or to a third party responsible for collection (this activity \nwill be \u2015ring-fenced\u2016 from the LGU); (ii) the collection from the drivers will be used to pay the \nGFI; and (iii) the GFI will pay DOF\u2019s Bureau of Treasury.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical  \n24.  ADB initially pilot tested two battery options: the lithium-ion batteries (38 kilograms) were \n72% lighter than the lead-acid ones (140 kilograms). The lithium-ion battery was subsequently \npiloted in 20 e-trikes with different battery sizes and charging options. Despite problems with \nservice and technical support, the pilot units have performed well overall. Collectively they have \ndriven more than 600,000 km on both city and hilly terrain.18 The pilot concluded that (i) lithium-\nion batteries are an environmentally sustainable battery choice; (ii) technically appropriate e-\ntrike designs are capable of meeting the variable range, speed, and terrain considerations in the \nPhilippines; and (iii) the fuel savings are significant and sufficient to support a lease-to-own e-\ntrike  scheme  for  the  drivers.  However,  because  of  the  sophisticated  battery  and  charging \ntechnologies, the drivers and LGUs will be unable to manage the risk of a faulty battery. To \naddress this technical risk, the project will ensure that the batteries have a 3-year warranty and \npayments to the supplier are staggered to match the warranty period.  \n \nB.  Sustainability \n25.  The lack of local technical support and spare parts has been a recurring reason for failed \ne-vehicle initiatives. Recognizing that drivers do not earn any income when their tricycles are \nnot  operational,  the  project  will  ensure  that they  have  access  to  a  standby  e-trike  or  are \ncompensated by the supplier for any losses within the warranty period. To address the pilot \nproject\u2019s lessons regarding the need for after-sales services, arrangements will be made for \neasy access to repair services, and technical components will be covered by a comprehensive \nwarranty.  Suppliers  will  be  required  to  establish  local  support  centers  to  honor  warranty \nobligations efficiently. Private sector suppliers are expected to provide the after-sales service, \nspare parts, and technical skills for maintenance after the warranty period as sufficient market \ndemand will have been created. To promote sustainability, $1 million from the CTF grant will be \nused for fine-tuning technology options, technology transfer, local industry support, and capacity \nbuilding.  Each  driver  will  also  be  required  to  undergo  a  comprehensive  training  program \ncovering (i) general introduction to e-vehicles and their components, (ii) troubleshooting, (iii) \nmaintenance, (iv) charging options, (v) safety, (vi) energy-efficient driving instructions, (vii) the \nwarranty, and (viii) a driver\u2019s responsibility. Manuals with clear illustrations in the local dialect \nwill also be distributed.  \n \nC.  Financial  \n \n26.  A detailed financial analysis was carried out in real terms using 2012 prices to examine \nthe aggregate costs and incremental benefits measured by the revenue from drivers or users. \nBased on field data from the pilot, a typical tricycle driver who uses about $6.50 worth of \ngasoline (5.5 liters) to drive 80 km per day can save about $5 per day by switching to an e-trike, \nwhich consumes 6 kilowatt-hour of power costing $1.50 per day. The financial internal rate of \nreturn (FIRR) exceeds 47% from the driver\u2019s perspective. The FIRR remained robust under \nsensitivity testing and in the most severe case of a daily lease payment increase by 10%, the \nFIRR declined to 16.5%. The government expects the cost of the e-trike office in an LGU will be \nequivalent  of  2%-3%  of  the  drivers\u2019  rental  payment  each  month;  there  will  be  no  cost \nimplications  for  the  LGU\u2019s  current  budget.  As  suppliers  become  established  and  operator \ndemand grows, the initial support role and supervision costs to the government will decline. \n                                                \n18 Antipolo, Laguna, Mandaluyong City, Marikina and Quezon City.  \n ", "8 \nD.  Economic  \n27.  A policy objective of the project is to generate demand for clean and efficient e-trike \ntechnology, although, the new units will initially substitute for old gasoline-powered tricycles. \nThe project\u2019s economic analysis is based on the non-incremental cost and benefit streams,  \ncomparing the \u2015with project\u2016 and \u2015without project\u2016 scenarios. Benefits are derived mainly from \nthe fuel savings or avoided costs from the importation of fuel. The economic internal rate of \nreturn (EIRR) is 23.7%, which exceeds the economic hurdle of 12%.19 This indicates that the \nproject is economically viable. Sensitivity analysis shows the EIRR drops to 17.5% if the price of \nimported oil falls by 20%. The main project beneficiaries will be e-trike drivers. Assuming about \nfive people depend on each driver\u2019s income, about 500,000 people will directly benefit from the \nproject\u2019s output. The fabrication of e-trikes and assembly will be domestic. The project could \ncreate about 10,000 jobs by 2015 with employment increasing as the e-trike industry grows. E-\ntrike drivers, passengers and the population at large will benefit from reduced emissions from e-\ntrikes.    \n \nE.  Governance \n28.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and DOE. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM. To ensure transparency and good governance, DOE will publicly \ndisclose on its website information on how loan proceeds are being used. ADB will organize \nspecial training for GFIs, DOE, and project management unit staff, and participating LGUs \ncovering all aspects of project implementation and ADB procedures, including procedures for \nimplementation,  procurement,  use  of  consultants,  disbursement,  reporting,  monitoring,  and \nprevention of fraud and corruption. \n \nF.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n29.  An e-trike will increase the daily take-home pay of its driver, with fuel savings alone \n(para  26)  generating  about  of  $1,800  per  year  for  drivers  and  their  families.  This  is  also \nexpected  to  facilitate  higher  trike  ownership  (only  8%  of  drivers  in  Davao  were  owners \ncompared with 40% in Boracay). The fuel cost savings of $5 per day will greatly benefit the \ndriver community and are the basis for the lease-to-own scheme. The project will not displace, \nor negatively affect the livelihoods of, tricycle drivers or families. Other developmental benefits \nwill  include  better  health  for  drivers,  passengers  and  urban  residents  through  lower  trike \nemissions; new skills development; job creation; and the establishment of a vehicle and spare \nparts supply industry. The additional net income of e-vehicle drivers and owners are expected to \nbe largely used in the participating communities. \n \n30.  The pilot e-trike design has accounted for women\u2019s needs. Female passengers were \nconsulted on the design and safety aspects of proposed e-trike models, especially for Metro \nManila. As this is a replacement program, the scope for female drivers will be limited. ADB's \ntarget is for at least 30% of charging station jobs to be filled by women (only for daytime shifts) \nand necessary training will be included. Female workers will also be trained to inspect the e-\ntrikes for basic safety issues (roadworthiness, for example) and collect e-trike operation data. \nThe health and safety benefits of the new design will be significant for the population, especially \nchildren.  \n \n                                                \n19 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nG.  Safeguards \n31.   The project is category C for environment, involuntary resettlement and indigenous \npeople. It will bring positive environmental and socioeconomic benefits because the e-trikes will \nnot generate any air or noise pollution, and will replace gasoline powered tricycles that use lead-\nacid batteries. A framework on material recovery and proper handling of old tricycles and used \nbatteries has been developed.20 In compliance with government\u2019s environmental regulations \nand ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), this framework describes the disposal options, \nwhich  will  be  evaluated further  during  implementation, for  old  tricycles  and  their  lead-acid \nbatteries as well as used lithium-ion batteries from the e-trikes. It also identifies the stakeholders \nand institutions involved and their responsibilities. This framework will be improved following \nfurther consultations.21  \n \nH.  Special Features \n \n32.  The project aims to create a competitive local e-vehicle industry using the latest battery \nand charging options, including solar charging. The project uses financing from the CTF22 as an \nintegral part of the project design for market transformation. The envisaged market shift from \ngasoline-power tricycles to e-trikes powered by cleaner, more efficient lithium-ion batteries will \n(i)  increase  access  to and  the  commercialization  of technology,  (ii)  establish  local  service \ndelivery and after sales support arrangements, (iii) introduce publicly available charging stations \nfor e-vehicles, and (iv) develop the local manufacturing of e-trikes. The development impacts of \nthe project are the initiation of a public sector-driven transformation of the tricycle industry into a \nlow-carbon industry that improves the welfare of e-trike operators.    \n \n33.  Clean Development Mechanism. The potential for emissions reduction per distributed \nand operational e-trike is likely to be about 3.8 ton per year of carbon dioxide equivalent \n(tCO e).23 The project is already published on the website24 of the United Nations Framework \n2\nConvention on Climate Change for public consultation and validation activities are under way. \nOnce registered, the project will generate certified emission reductions (footnote 20).  \n \nI.
