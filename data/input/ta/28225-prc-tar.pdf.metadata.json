INTRODUCTION\n1. The Bank's country strategy for the People's Republic of China (PRO) emphasizes\nbalanced regional development. Poverty is concentrated in the regions of western and\nsouthwestern PRO, which also have the highest concentrations of ethnic minority groups and\nthe lowest participation in basic education, particularly among girls. Since 1993 the Bank has\nbeen assisting the education sector in the PRO through provision of advisory technical\nassistance (TA). The general aim of the TA has been to build capacity in selected high priority\nareas of educational development. During the 1995 Country Programming Mission, the\nGovernment reconfirmed its request for further TA to support an overall program to improve\nbasic education for ethnic minorities. A TA Fact-Finding Mission visited the PRO 10-21 July 1995\nto review the general status of basic education for ethnic minority groups, examine the\nmanagement structure of ethnic minority basic education, identify the main issues, and determine\nappropriate strategies for addressing those issues. This Paper is based on the Mission's findings\nand the understanding reached between the Government and the Mission on the objectives,\nscope, cost estimates and financing plan, and implementation arrangements for the advisory\nTA.1\nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. Basic education in the PRC comprises six years of primary and three years of\nlower secondary schooling. The Government has given high priority to the universalization of\nbasic education as an essential component of national development. Considerable progress has\nbeen made toward the goal of universalization. In 1994, approximately 98 percent of children of\nprimary school age were enrolled, and a gross enrollment rate2 of about 73.8 percent for lower\nsecondary school had been achieved. The size of the basic education subsector is enormous\nwith a 1994 primary enrollment of 130 million in 683,000 primary schools, and a lower secondary\nenrollment of 43.2 million. By the year 2000 the Government aims to achieve national enrollment\nrates of 99 percent for primary (135 million students) and 85 percent for lower secondary (55\nmillion students) schools. Specific targets vary from region to region.\n3. The Department of Basic Education of the State Education Commission (SEdO)\nis responsible for the overall management of the implementation of basic education policies. The\nDepartment provides guidance on curriculum content, approves textbooks, monitors and\nevaluates teaching effectiveness, and prepares guidelines for the training of teachers and school\nprincipals. The general management and administration of primary schools is the responsibility\nof the county and township education offices under the provincial education commissions.\nProvincial, prefectural, and county governments are responsible for funding basic education in\ntheir areas. In addition, the Government has established a special central fund for universal basic\neducation to support ethnic minority regions.\n4. There are 55 distinct ethnic minority groups in the PRO with a total population of\nabout 91 .2 million (approximately 8.4 percent of the national population). Ethnic minority groups\npresent a complex cultural and linguistic mosaic with 53 of the groups having their own\nThe TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in April 1995,\nThe total number of children enrolled in school (regardless of age) as a percentage of the total number of\nchildren in the nominal age group for that level of schooling.\nI\t\n\u2014\t I\t \u2014", "2\nlanguage. Most of the ethnic minority population lives in five autonomous regions. According to\nstate policy, an autonomous region can allow the use of an ethnic minority language as the\nmedium of classroom instruction where students in that ethnic minority group comprise a\nmajority of the enrollment in a school. Minority languages can also be used for textbooks. Local\ngovernments may also set up special funds for minority education and set their own guidelines\nfor course content and teacher qualifications. The local authorities in an autonomous region may\nalso establish primary boarding schools in nomadic zones and special lower secondary schools\n(i.e., normal schools) for training ethnic minority primary school teachers.\n5. The SEdC's Department of Ethnic Minority Education (DEME) is responsible for\noverall coordination and management of minority education, including providing guidance for\nthe development of textbooks and instructional materials, and for the training of ethnic minority\neducation administrators at provincial, county, and district levels. Provincial education\ncommissions in ethnic minority regions have divisions for ethnic minority education, and\nprefectures and counties have ethnic minority education sections and subsections. All of these\naim to provide support to administrators and teachers involved in ethnic minority education.\n6. In 1949, 90 percent of PRO's ethnic minority population was illiterate. Substantial\nprogress has been made in recent decades. The illiteracy rate in the five autonomous regions\nand four provinces with a high concentration of ethnic minority population was estimated in 1990\nat about 23 percent. The status of basic education in ethnic minority regions is still behind that\nof the nation as a whole. A number of general issues remain to be resolved, including (i)\ninadequate funding, which limits investment in the expansion of facilities and the development\nof appropriate instructional materials; (ii) a proliferation of small, single-teacher schools in\nsparsely populated regions, which do not offer the full six-year primary program; (iii) limited\navailability of instructional materials in ethnic minority languages; (iv) a lower than average\nretention rate especially for girls; (v) poor physical facilities, particularly in remote areas; and (vi)\ninsufficient numbers of qualified teachers from ethnic minority groups.\n7. In addition to the above, the management of basic education for ethnic minorities\nis constrained by the following:\n(i) Inadequate data base. Although national education statistics are collected and\nprocessed, they are not disaggregated in such a way as to yield an adequate\npicture of the situation of ethnic minority basic education. The Statistics Division\nof the SEdC's Department of Planning and Construction deals largely with\nnational and provincial-level data, and it is difficult for education managers in\nareas having high concentrations of ethnic minority students to obtain and utilize\nadequate local data on key indicators for purposes of policy monitoring and\nmanagement. As a result, available information is insufficient for guiding policy\nformulation and monitoring on such topics as the extent of bilingual teaching, the\ndropout rate for particular ethnic minority groups, the percentage of qualified\nteachers, and the transition rate from primary to lower secondary schools in\nparticular ethnic minority areas. DEME staff at local levels require skills in data\ncollection and analysis themselves.\n\t\n(ii) Limited policy implementation and dissemination capacity. Many policies\nregarding ethnic minority education have been developed by the Government.", "3\nThe compilation of these policies into a single comprehensive document and the\npreparation of a detailed set of implementation guidelines have not been fully\nundertaken. As a result, understanding of official policies and implementation\nstrategies is inadequate and their interpretation can be inconsistent.\n(iii) Insufficient research capacity. Development of adequate strategies to improve\nethnic minority education requires a solid understanding of local circumstances.\nThe capacity of DEME to formulate research programs and guide their\nimplementation at the field level is limited. Research design, research training, and\nresearch implementation need strengthening if an adequate research base is to\ncontribute effectively to ethnic minority education development.\n(iv) Limited administrative training capacity. Although there are ethnic minority\nadministrators at the provincial, prefectural, and county levels, many newly\nappointed ones have not received the necessary orientation and training. In\naddition, the principals of the 11 0 ethnic minority normal schools (which are the\nmain source of teachers for ethnic minority primary schools) have not had\nsufficient training in school administration. This lack of adequately trained\npersonnel reduces the overall efficiency of the administration of ethnic minority\neducation.\n8. The Government has given priority to achieving universal basic education. it\nrecognizes that reaching this goal will require special resources and efforts, particularly with\nregard to the relatively poor and disadvantaged ethnic minority regions. DEME has done a\ndetailed analysis of its constraints and has identified appropriate strategies to improve its\ncapacity to manage and coordinate ethnic minority education more effectively, particularly in the\nareas of research and data collection. However, DEME lacks the staff and the financial resources\nto implement the necessary strategies. The TA will help improve the management of ethnic\nminority education through building the capacity of DEME at the national and local levels.\nFurthermore, the TA supports the Bank's PRO country strategy of reducing regional disparities\nby strengthening the management of basic education for a segment of the population in\ndisadvantaged regions whose access to social services and whose per capita income are\nsubstantially below the national average.\nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objectives\n9. The TA is designed to support the achievement of universal basic education for\nethnic minority groups through strengthening the management capacity of DEME. The specific\nobjectives are to (i) design and pilot-test a system for collecting and analyzing data from ethnic\nminority schools, (ii) develop research capacity, (iii) compile and disseminate policy guidelines\nfor ethnic minority education, (iv) enhance administrative training capacity, and (v) enrich\nknowledge about ethnic minority and bilingual education strategies being used in other\ncountries.\n.1", "4\nB.\t Scope\n10. The TA includes (i) provision of international and domestic consulting services in\nthe areas of statistics, research design, contemporary minority education practices, minority\neducation policy, and administrative training; (ii) publication of policy guidelines, selected\nresearch studies, research training guidelines, statistical profiles of ethnic minority education in\nselected countries, and a manual for data collection and analysis; (iii) local administrative training\nworkshops; (iv) short overseas study for key administrators to countries such as Canada and\nAustralia, which have considerable experience in ethnic minority education; and (v) purchase of\nlimited equipment for the implementation of the TA.\nC.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n11. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $545,000, of which $500,000 equivalent\nwill be provided by the Bank on a grant basis covering the entire foreign exchange cost of\n$320,000 and up to $1 80,000 equivalent of the local currency costs, including $86,000 equivalent\nfor domestic consultants' remuneration and per diem. The Government will fund the remaining\n$45,000 equivalent of local currency costs. A table summarizing the cost estimates is in\nAppendix 1.\nImplementation Arrangements\n12 A team of 3 international and 12 domestic consultants will be recruited to provide\nspecialist services totaling 28 person-months in (i) education management information system\n(MIS) design, (ii) research design, (iii) ethnic minority and bilingual education, (iv) administration\ntraining, and (v) policy analysis and implementation. Six person-months will be provided by\ninternational consultants. Consultants will be recruited according to the Bank's  Guidelines on the\nUse of Consultants.

The Implementing Agency will be DEME, which will be responsible for arranging the\nconsultants' programs and providing counterparts.\n14. The TA will be implemented in three phases. During Phase 1 (about four months),\nthe consultants will (i) develop a methodology for establishing a data base for ethnic minority\neducation, (ii) identify and design selected key research studies, (iii) prepare draft field manuals\nfor data collection and research, and (iv) train local officials in methods of data collection and\nresearch. The domestic consultants will prepare a training program for ethnic minority education\nadministrators and principals of normal secondary schools. The domestic consultants will also\nbegin the task of preparing detailed policy implementation guidelines for ethnic minority\neducation. The consultants will prepare a detailed plan for overseas training which will focus on\nprogram administration, research, and data collection and analysis. Equipment required for TA\nimplementation (including computers, printers, a facsimile machine, and equipment for training)\nwill be procured in Phase 1 under arrangements satisfactory to the Bank.\n15. During Phase 2 (about six months), the domestic consultants will supervise the\ndata collection and research designed during Phase 1, and local and overseas training programs\nwill be undertaken. The international specialist in bilingual education will deliver lectures and", "seminars during this phase. The domestic consultants will complete the development of policy\nimplementation guidelines for ethnic minority education. During Phase 3 (about three months),\nthe international and domestic consultants will (i) refine the training manuals for research and\ndata collection, (ii) prepare the research studies for publication, and (iii) evaluate the overall\nprogress of the TA for a final report, which will be compiled by DEME.\n16. A tripartite meeting will be held at the end of Phase 1 to assess the progress of\nthe TA and to review the arrangements for Phases 2 and 3. A final meeting will be held at the\nend of Phase 3 to review the overall achievements of the TA. The TA is expected to begin in\nMarch 1996 and to be completed by the end of April 1997. Major outputs will be (i) training\nmanuals in research and data collection for use by local managers of ethnic minority education,\n(ii) research studies on key topics, and (iii) revised guidelines for the implementation of ethnic\nminority basic education programs.\nIV.

INTRODUCTION\n1. The Bank's country strategy for the People's Republic of China (PRO) emphasizes\nbalanced regional development. Poverty is concentrated in the regions of western and\nsouthwestern PRO, which also have the highest concentrations of ethnic minority groups and\nthe lowest participation in basic education, particularly among girls. Since 1993 the Bank has\nbeen assisting the education sector in the PRO through provision of advisory technical\nassistance (TA). The general aim of the TA has been to build capacity in selected high priority\nareas of educational development. During the 1995 Country Programming Mission, the\nGovernment reconfirmed its request for further TA to support an overall program to improve\nbasic education for ethnic minorities. A TA Fact-Finding Mission visited the PRO 10-21 July 1995\nto review the general status of basic education for ethnic minority groups, examine the\nmanagement structure of ethnic minority basic education, identify the main issues, and determine\nappropriate strategies for addressing those issues. This Paper is based on the Mission's findings\nand the understanding reached between the Government and the Mission on the objectives,\nscope, cost estimates and financing plan, and implementation arrangements for the advisory\nTA.1\nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. Basic education in the PRC comprises six years of primary and three years of\nlower secondary schooling. The Government has given high priority to the universalization of\nbasic education as an essential component of national development. Considerable progress has\nbeen made toward the goal of universalization. In 1994, approximately 98 percent of children of\nprimary school age were enrolled, and a gross enrollment rate2 of about 73.8 percent for lower\nsecondary school had been achieved. The size of the basic education subsector is enormous\nwith a 1994 primary enrollment of 130 million in 683,000 primary schools, and a lower secondary\nenrollment of 43.2 million. By the year 2000 the Government aims to achieve national enrollment\nrates of 99 percent for primary (135 million students) and 85 percent for lower secondary (55\nmillion students) schools. Specific targets vary from region to region.\n3. The Department of Basic Education of the State Education Commission (SEdO)\nis responsible for the overall management of the implementation of basic education policies. The\nDepartment provides guidance on curriculum content, approves textbooks, monitors and\nevaluates teaching effectiveness, and prepares guidelines for the training of teachers and school\nprincipals. The general management and administration of primary schools is the responsibility\nof the county and township education offices under the provincial education commissions.\nProvincial, prefectural, and county governments are responsible for funding basic education in\ntheir areas. In addition, the Government has established a special central fund for universal basic\neducation to support ethnic minority regions.\n4. There are 55 distinct ethnic minority groups in the PRO with a total population of\nabout 91 .2 million (approximately 8.4 percent of the national population). Ethnic minority groups\npresent a complex cultural and linguistic mosaic with 53 of the groups having their own\nThe TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in April 1995,\nThe total number of children enrolled in school (regardless of age) as a percentage of the total number of\nchildren in the nominal age group for that level of schooling.\nI\t\n\u2014\t I\t \u2014", "2\nlanguage. Most of the ethnic minority population lives in five autonomous regions. According to\nstate policy, an autonomous region can allow the use of an ethnic minority language as the\nmedium of classroom instruction where students in that ethnic minority group comprise a\nmajority of the enrollment in a school. Minority languages can also be used for textbooks. Local\ngovernments may also set up special funds for minority education and set their own guidelines\nfor course content and teacher qualifications. The local authorities in an autonomous region may\nalso establish primary boarding schools in nomadic zones and special lower secondary schools\n(i.e., normal schools) for training ethnic minority primary school teachers.\n5. The SEdC's Department of Ethnic Minority Education (DEME) is responsible for\noverall coordination and management of minority education, including providing guidance for\nthe development of textbooks and instructional materials, and for the training of ethnic minority\neducation administrators at provincial, county, and district levels. Provincial education\ncommissions in ethnic minority regions have divisions for ethnic minority education, and\nprefectures and counties have ethnic minority education sections and subsections. All of these\naim to provide support to administrators and teachers involved in ethnic minority education.\n6. In 1949, 90 percent of PRO's ethnic minority population was illiterate. Substantial\nprogress has been made in recent decades. The illiteracy rate in the five autonomous regions\nand four provinces with a high concentration of ethnic minority population was estimated in 1990\nat about 23 percent. The status of basic education in ethnic minority regions is still behind that\nof the nation as a whole. A number of general issues remain to be resolved, including (i)\ninadequate funding, which limits investment in the expansion of facilities and the development\nof appropriate instructional materials; (ii) a proliferation of small, single-teacher schools in\nsparsely populated regions, which do not offer the full six-year primary program; (iii) limited\navailability of instructional materials in ethnic minority languages; (iv) a lower than average\nretention rate especially for girls; (v) poor physical facilities, particularly in remote areas; and (vi)\ninsufficient numbers of qualified teachers from ethnic minority groups.\n7. In addition to the above, the management of basic education for ethnic minorities\nis constrained by the following:\n(i) Inadequate data base. Although national education statistics are collected and\nprocessed, they are not disaggregated in such a way as to yield an adequate\npicture of the situation of ethnic minority basic education. The Statistics Division\nof the SEdC's Department of Planning and Construction deals largely with\nnational and provincial-level data, and it is difficult for education managers in\nareas having high concentrations of ethnic minority students to obtain and utilize\nadequate local data on key indicators for purposes of policy monitoring and\nmanagement. As a result, available information is insufficient for guiding policy\nformulation and monitoring on such topics as the extent of bilingual teaching, the\ndropout rate for particular ethnic minority groups, the percentage of qualified\nteachers, and the transition rate from primary to lower secondary schools in\nparticular ethnic minority areas. DEME staff at local levels require skills in data\ncollection and analysis themselves.\n\t\n(ii) Limited policy implementation and dissemination capacity. Many policies\nregarding ethnic minority education have been developed by the Government.", "3\nThe compilation of these policies into a single comprehensive document and the\npreparation of a detailed set of implementation guidelines have not been fully\nundertaken. As a result, understanding of official policies and implementation\nstrategies is inadequate and their interpretation can be inconsistent.\n(iii) Insufficient research capacity. Development of adequate strategies to improve\nethnic minority education requires a solid understanding of local circumstances.\nThe capacity of DEME to formulate research programs and guide their\nimplementation at the field level is limited. Research design, research training, and\nresearch implementation need strengthening if an adequate research base is to\ncontribute effectively to ethnic minority education development.\n(iv) Limited administrative training capacity. Although there are ethnic minority\nadministrators at the provincial, prefectural, and county levels, many newly\nappointed ones have not received the necessary orientation and training. In\naddition, the principals of the 11 0 ethnic minority normal schools (which are the\nmain source of teachers for ethnic minority primary schools) have not had\nsufficient training in school administration. This lack of adequately trained\npersonnel reduces the overall efficiency of the administration of ethnic minority\neducation.\n8. The Government has given priority to achieving universal basic education. it\nrecognizes that reaching this goal will require special resources and efforts, particularly with\nregard to the relatively poor and disadvantaged ethnic minority regions. DEME has done a\ndetailed analysis of its constraints and has identified appropriate strategies to improve its\ncapacity to manage and coordinate ethnic minority education more effectively, particularly in the\nareas of research and data collection. However, DEME lacks the staff and the financial resources\nto implement the necessary strategies. The TA will help improve the management of ethnic\nminority education through building the capacity of DEME at the national and local levels.\nFurthermore, the TA supports the Bank's PRO country strategy of reducing regional disparities\nby strengthening the management of basic education for a segment of the population in\ndisadvantaged regions whose access to social services and whose per capita income are\nsubstantially below the national average.\nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objectives\n9. The TA is designed to support the achievement of universal basic education for\nethnic minority groups through strengthening the management capacity of DEME. The specific\nobjectives are to (i) design and pilot-test a system for collecting and analyzing data from ethnic\nminority schools, (ii) develop research capacity, (iii) compile and disseminate policy guidelines\nfor ethnic minority education, (iv) enhance administrative training capacity, and (v) enrich\nknowledge about ethnic minority and bilingual education strategies being used in other\ncountries.\n.1", "4\nB.\t Scope\n10. The TA includes (i) provision of international and domestic consulting services in\nthe areas of statistics, research design, contemporary minority education practices, minority\neducation policy, and administrative training; (ii) publication of policy guidelines, selected\nresearch studies, research training guidelines, statistical profiles of ethnic minority education in\nselected countries, and a manual for data collection and analysis; (iii) local administrative training\nworkshops; (iv) short overseas study for key administrators to countries such as Canada and\nAustralia, which have considerable experience in ethnic minority education; and (v) purchase of\nlimited equipment for the implementation of the TA.\nC.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n11. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $545,000, of which $500,000 equivalent\nwill be provided by the Bank on a grant basis covering the entire foreign exchange cost of\n$320,000 and up to $1 80,000 equivalent of the local currency costs, including $86,000 equivalent\nfor domestic consultants' remuneration and per diem. The Government will fund the remaining\n$45,000 equivalent of local currency costs. A table summarizing the cost estimates is in\nAppendix 1.\nImplementation Arrangements\n12 A team of 3 international and 12 domestic consultants will be recruited to provide\nspecialist services totaling 28 person-months in (i) education management information system\n(MIS) design, (ii) research design, (iii) ethnic minority and bilingual education, (iv) administration\ntraining, and (v) policy analysis and implementation. Six person-months will be provided by\ninternational consultants. Consultants will be recruited according to the Bank's  Guidelines on the\nUse of Consultants.

The Implementing Agency will be DEME, which will be responsible for arranging the\nconsultants' programs and providing counterparts.\n14. The TA will be implemented in three phases. During Phase 1 (about four months),\nthe consultants will (i) develop a methodology for establishing a data base for ethnic minority\neducation, (ii) identify and design selected key research studies, (iii) prepare draft field manuals\nfor data collection and research, and (iv) train local officials in methods of data collection and\nresearch. The domestic consultants will prepare a training program for ethnic minority education\nadministrators and principals of normal secondary schools. The domestic consultants will also\nbegin the task of preparing detailed policy implementation guidelines for ethnic minority\neducation. The consultants will prepare a detailed plan for overseas training which will focus on\nprogram administration, research, and data collection and analysis. Equipment required for TA\nimplementation (including computers, printers, a facsimile machine, and equipment for training)\nwill be procured in Phase 1 under arrangements satisfactory to the Bank.\n15. During Phase 2 (about six months), the domestic consultants will supervise the\ndata collection and research designed during Phase 1, and local and overseas training programs\nwill be undertaken. The international specialist in bilingual education will deliver lectures and", "seminars during this phase. The domestic consultants will complete the development of policy\nimplementation guidelines for ethnic minority education. During Phase 3 (about three months),\nthe international and domestic consultants will (i) refine the training manuals for research and\ndata collection, (ii) prepare the research studies for publication, and (iii) evaluate the overall\nprogress of the TA for a final report, which will be compiled by DEME.\n16. A tripartite meeting will be held at the end of Phase 1 to assess the progress of\nthe TA and to review the arrangements for Phases 2 and 3. A final meeting will be held at the\nend of Phase 3 to review the overall achievements of the TA. The TA is expected to begin in\nMarch 1996 and to be completed by the end of April 1997. Major outputs will be (i) training\nmanuals in research and data collection for use by local managers of ethnic minority education,\n(ii) research studies on key topics, and (iii) revised guidelines for the implementation of ethnic\nminority basic education programs.\nIV.
