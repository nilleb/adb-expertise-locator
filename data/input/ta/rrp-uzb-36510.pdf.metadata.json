The \nProject  will  extend  the  textbook  rental  scheme  (TRS)  established \nunder the Basic Education Textbook Development Project (BETDP) to \ngrades 6, 7, and 8. This will complete TRS coverage of all grades and \nall schools in the country. The Project will also establish appropriate \ninstitutional  arrangements  for  ensuring  sustainable  provision  of \naffordable textbooks.  \n \nThe Project will address other key issues in textbook and learning \nmaterials development, including reforming the national curriculum and \nencouraging  private  sector  growth  in  publishing  and  printing.  To \nsupport new approaches to learning, school libraries will be developed \non a pilot basis as resource centers, with provision of books and other \nlearning/teaching  materials,  adequate  furniture,  equipment,  and \ncomputers.  \n   \nRationale  Given  the  dominant  role  of  textbooks  in  education  in  Uzbekistan, \nsustainable provision of affordable textbooks is key to improving the \nquality  and  relevance  of  basic  education.  The  Government  has \nrecently strengthened the focus on basic education as the basis for \ndevelopment, and is giving the Project a high priority to support its \nNational Program for School Education Development 2004\u20132009. \n   \nObjective  The goal of the Project is to improve the quality of basic education. \nThe  purpose  is  to  establish  efficient  and  sustainable  nationwide \nprovision  of  affordable  textbooks,  and  other  instructional  materials, \nsupported by necessary institutional and policy reforms.  \n \n ", "iv   \n  The Project comprises four components: (i) strengthening the basic \neducation policy framework by reforming the curriculum, modernizing \ntesting  and  assessment  systems,  and  conducting  related  research \nstudies;  (ii)  ensuring  the  sustainable  provision  of  textbooks  by \nsupplying  affordable  textbooks  nationwide  and  strengthening  the \ninstitutional  basis  of  the  TRS;  (iii)  developing  the  book  publishing \nsector  by  encouraging  authors,  improving  implementation  of  the \nCopyright Law, and promoting private sector participation in publishing \nand printing; and (iv) developing school libraries in 1,000 pilot schools \nby providing adequate space, furniture, books and other instructional \nmaterials, audiovisual equipment, and computers. \n   \nCost Estimates  The total cost of the Project is estimated at $55.0 million equivalent, \nincluding  physical  and  price  contingencies,  taxes  and  duties,  and \ninterest  and  other  charges.  Of  the  total  cost,  $23.8  million  (43%) \ncomprises  the  foreign exchange  cost,  and  $31.2  million equivalent \n(57%) the local currency cost.  \n \nFinancing Plan  ($ million) \n  Source  Foreign  Local  Total  Percent \nExchange Currency  Cost \n  Asian Development Bank  23.8  1.2  25.0  45 \n  Government  0.0  30.0  30.0  55 \n           Total  23.8  31.2  55.0  100 \n           \nLoan Amount and  A loan of $25 million equivalent from the ordinary capital resources of \nTerms  ADB  will  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate \n(LIBOR)-based  lending  facility.  The  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term, \nincluding a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment \ncharge of 0.75% per annum, and such other terms and conditions as \nare set forth in the Loan Agreement.  \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 January 2010 \n \nEstimated Project   31 July 2009 \nCompletion Date   \n \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Public Education (MOPE) \n \n    ", "  v\nImplementation  The project steering committee (PSC) established for BETDP will be \nArrangements  maintained for the Project as the decision-making body responsible for \noverall project coordination. The PSC will meet quarterly to review \nproject implementation status, discuss implementation issues, provide \nbroad  guidance,  ensure  coordination  among  different  agencies, \nresolve issues, and review and advise on the annual implementation \nplan. MOPE will appoint a deputy minister as project director. The \nproject  director  will  provide  general  guidance  to  the  project \nimplementation unit (PIU) in accordance with decisions made by the \nPSC; arrange the quarterly meetings of, and present quarterly reports \nto the PSC; and ensure coordination of project implementation within \nMOPE. The project director will be responsible for MOPE policy inputs.   \n \n  A project manager will be recruited to report to the project director and \nbe responsible for coordinating and supervising the work of the PIU.  \nThe PIU, which will comprise the project manager and 6 staff, will be \nresponsible for day-to-day project implementation, including financial \nmanagement.  Core staff of the BETDP PIU will be retained as they \nhave  extensive  relevant  experience  and  a  good  track  record  in \nsuccessfully implementing the BETDP. \n   \nProcurement  The Project will procure textbooks and related materials for grades 6, \n7,  and  8;  furniture  and  audiovisual  equipment;  library  books  and \nmaterials;  and  information  and  technology  equipment  for  school \nlibraries; and furniture and computers for office and administrative use. \nADB  loan-financed  goods  and  services  will  be  procured  following \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Selected  supply  contracts  for \nfurniture,  equipment,  textbooks,  library  books,  and  supporting \ninstructional  materials  may  be  awarded  on  the  basis  of  local \ncompetitive  bidding  acceptable  to  ADB.  Necessary  civil  works  to \nrehabilitate  and  upgrade  school  libraries  will  be  financed  and \nundertaken by  the  Government.  Rehabilitation  work  will  involve  no \nresettlement or negative environmental impact. \n   \nConsulting Services  The  Project  will  require  937  person-months  of  consulting  services, \nconsisting  of  61  person-months  of  international  and  876  person-\nmonths of domestic consulting. Because of the highly integrated nature \nof the project components, international consultants will be engaged \nthrough a firm using quality and cost-based selection in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  Domestic \nconsultants  with  relevant  expertise  in  areas  including  curriculum \nreform, assessment and testing, and language of instruction will be \nselected using selection procedures satisfactory to ADB.  \n   ", "vi   \nProject Benefits and  Direct benefits of the Project will include the sustainable provision of \nBeneficiaries  affordable textbooks nationwide. This will have a significant impact on \nensuring quality of basic education. The curriculum reform assisted by \na modernized assessment and testing system will generate quality \nimprovements  in  education,  and  enhance  the  cost-effectiveness  of \nbasic education. The latter will be strengthened by an  increase in \ncompetition  and  private  sector  participation  in  book  sector \ndevelopment. The pilot school library improvement will introduce new \nmaterials  and  an  environment  to  support  and  enhance  student-\ncentered learning in 10% of all schools. Six million students nationwide \nin grades 2\u20139 will be the main beneficiaries. These include (i) those \nfrom the poorest families (15% of the total) who will be supplied with \nfree textbooks by the Government with improved targeting, and (ii) 0.4 \nmillion students in minority language schools. Over 160,000 teachers \nand  1,200  librarians  and  specialists  will  benefit  from  new  teacher \nguides, new books, and in-service training. In addition, a number of \nspecialists  in  curriculum,  various  areas  of  educational  policy,  and \npublishing and printing will receive relevant training. \n   \nRisks and  The Project faces three main risks. First, a reversal or slowdown of the \nAssumptions  sector reform could have an adverse impact on the Project. To mitigate \nthis risk, ADB will continue to engage the Government in and assist \nwith  sector  reform  and  management.  Second,  the  financial \nsustainability of the TRS will depend on (i) maintaining a collection rate \nsufficient for replacing textbooks at regular intervals; and (ii) proper \nmanagement of the accumulated rental fees. \n   \n  The republican textbook revolving fund foundation will be established \nspecifically to address this risk by providing professional management \nof  the  rental  fees  accumulated  under  the  TRS,  and  systematic \nsupervision and monitoring at central, oblast, raion, and school levels. \nRetention of the experienced PIU from the BETDP to operate as the \nPIU for the Project will contribute significantly to mitigating this risk. \nThird,  successful  project  implementation  requires  significant \ninstitutional  capacity  of  the  Government  to  ensure  effective \ncoordination with central agencies and at different government levels. \nThis risk will be mitigated by (i) building on the experience at all levels \nof government, including the PIU, gained from implementation of the \nBETDP; (ii) improving coordination and monitoring ability as a result of \nADB\u2019s past assistance, including the education monitoring unit set up \nat the Cabinet of Ministers; (iii) enhancing efficiency resulting from the \nGovernment\u2019s  implementation  of  the  National  Program  for  School \nEducation  Development  2004\u20132009;  and  (iv)  continuing  efforts  at \nMOPE  to  build  mechanisms  for  better  coordination  between  the \nProject and the ADB-funded Education Sector Development Program. \n    ", " \nv\nii\n ", "     \n \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of Uzbekistan for the Second Textbook Development Project. \n \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n2.  According to Uzbekistan\u2019s Constitution, every citizen is entitled to basic education, which \nis  provided  by  the  public  sector.  The  Government  requested  assistance  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to address key constraints in basic education development, including \nthe  sustainable  provision  of  affordable  textbooks  and  other  learning  materials,  curriculum \nreform, and school library development. The Project is designed to address these issues. The \nproject framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n3.  Basic education in Uzbekistan starts at age 6 and comprises grades 1 to 9. Senior \nsecondary education continues from grades 10 to 12 and will be compulsory from 2010. Higher \neducation consists of a 4-year bachelor of arts program followed by a 2-year masters program \nand then a doctoral program. Basic information on the education system and structure is in \nAppendix 2. \n \n4.  In 2003/04, of the 9,727 basic secondary schools, 2,006 (20.6%) were urban. This figure \nhas been stable for the past 10 years. Of the 6.3 million students enrolled, 40.1% were in \ngrades 1\u20134. The annual enrolment growth rate has averaged around 2.5% per year over the \npast 6 years, mainly reflecting continued recovery from the decline during the early transition \nyears. In urban areas, net primary enrolment rates fell from 90.1% in 1990 to 87.8% in 1998; in \nrural areas the rates fell from 85.6% to 84.9%. The rates are currently estimated at 98%. \nHowever, the level of attendance is a problem especially in poor regions, although reliable data \nis not available. The cost and relevance of education may be among factors that affect school \nattendance. The primary completion rate is estimated to be high. The ratio of boys to girls in \nbasic education is virtually 1:1, and 99.3% of the population is literate, with no significant gender \ndifferential in basic education.1 \n \n5.  Education expenditure as a percentage of total budgets increased from 22.4% in 1997 to \n38% in 2003.2 Of particular note, public expenditure on clothing, textbooks, and other learning \nmaterials for grade 1 and poor and vulnerable students increased in real terms by around 150% \nbetween 1997 and 2002. The National Program for School Education Development (NPSED) \n2004\u20132009 was announced in June 2004 and envisages significant increases in investment in \nbasic  education,  as  compared  with  the  emphasis  on  strengthening  senior  secondary  and \nvocational education over the past few years.  \n \n                                                 \n1 Gender differentials begin to appear in senior secondary education and are more marked in higher education in \nterms of enrolment levels and choice of courses.  \n2  Public expenditure as a percentage of gross domestic product increased from 7.3% in 1997 to an estimated 10% in \n2003/04. \n ", "2 \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n6.  Notwithstanding the progress already made since the late 1990s, formidable challenges \nremain  for  the  Government  to  realize  its  long-term  goal  of  making  the  education  system \nconsistent with a market-oriented economy and a democratic society in the 21st century. In \nbasic education, the challenge is to improve quality and relevance, where textbooks play a key \nrole  in  determining  student  performance.  ADB  approved  the  Basic  Education  Textbook \nDevelopment Project (BETDP)3 in 1997 and has been initially successful in supporting textbook \ndevelopment and provision. A basic education subsector analysis with a problem tree is in \nAppendix 3.  \n \n1.  Basic Education and Textbook Subsector Issues \n7.  Textbooks  and  Curriculum.  In  Uzbekistan  textbooks  are  almost  the  only  form  of \nteaching and learning support provided for both students and teaching staff. Therefore they are \na key material input in influencing quality and relevance of basic education. In 1998, as a result \nof growing financial constraints, the Government terminated the policy of free provision of \ntextbooks.  While  most  parents  found  textbooks  at  full  price  unaffordable,  suppliers  also \nstruggled with uncertainty of demand and credit. By 2000, serious textbook shortages were \nbeing  experienced  in  many  schools.  In  2001,  the  BETDP  successfully  introduced  a  pilot \ntextbook  rental  scheme  (TRS).  The  TRS  effectively  addressed  the  affordability  issue  by \nreducing parental expenditure on textbooks to an annual rental fee. The fee was approximately \n5 times cheaper than the total purchase price of a set of textbooks. Schools and parents \nstrongly supported the TRS pilot, which achieved a collection rate of 93%. As a result of this \nsuccess, the TRS was extended nationwide to cover grades 2\u20135 and 9.  \n \n8.  National coverage of the TRS to include affordable core textbooks and teacher guides \nfor all grades of basic education, except grade 1, is now needed.4 In addition, the institutional \nbasis of the TRS needs to be placed on a sound footing so that the accumulated rental fees are \nprofessionally managed to ensure sustainability of textbook and teacher-guide provision. By \n2007,  centralized  funding  of  core  textbooks  and  teacher  guides  will  cease  and  textbook \nreplacement supplies will be funded from the rental fee balances accumulated in school bank \naccounts. The transition from centralized to decentralized funding and from central to school-\nbased decision-making will require careful planning and management. National monitoring and \nsupervision  of  the  TRS  within  the  Ministry  of  Public  Education  (MOPE)  also  needs  to  be \nimproved and institutionalized. At present, the Government provides support for the socially \nunprotected\u2014approximately 15% of the student population. This support is in the form of free \ntextbooks and teacher guides provided to school libraries with schools in rich and poor areas \nreceiving a similar proportion of free books. Targeting the poor must also be improved.  \n \n9.  Curriculum and learning materials are closely connected. Curriculum design determines \nthe  content,  sequencing,  methodology,  and  presentation  of  information  in  textbooks,  and \ntherefore has a direct bearing on the nature and quality of the education provided. Although \ncurriculum reform has been in progress since 1991, the Uzbek curriculum remains overloaded \nwith too many subjects and an undue emphasis on rote learning rather than on developing key \nskills. The overloaded curriculum reinforces didactic, teacher-centered classroom approaches at \nthe expense of student-centered learning (SCL) because teachers must rush through classes to \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 1997. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nRepublic of Uzbekistan for the Basic Education Textbook Development Project. Manila. \n4  The Government continues to provide free textbooks for grade 1 pupils.  \n    ", "3 \nachieve  the  heavy  content  requirements,  leaving  no  time  for  interactions  with  and  among \nstudents. Such an overloaded curriculum also has high cost implications. Additional savings in \ntextbook supply could be achieved by reducing curriculum textbook requirements. Successful \ncurriculum reform will improve the quality and reduce the costs of basic education.  \n \n10.  A reformed assessment and testing system is central to upgrading the quality of basic \neducation. Schools in Uzbekistan rely on tests that are made up and graded by individual \nteachers. With such a system, comparing student performance on a national, oblast, raion or \nschool basis, or year-on-year basis is impossible. The reform of existing assessment practices \nmust be synchronized with curriculum reform.  \n \n11.  The Uzbek Constitution grants the right to citizens to education in their own languages, \ni.e., Russian, Karakalpak, Kazakh, Tajik, Kyrgyz, and Turkmen. To maintain cost and quality \nequity between the different language groups, the Government provides subsidies for minority \nlanguage textbook publishing. However, the Government has had difficulty maintaining the \nnecessary funding at the required level, especially in times of fiscal constraints. A review of \nlanguage of instruction (LOI) practices is needed to ensure greater equity and to contribute to \noverall system cost reduction.  \n \n12.  Information and communication technology (ICT) development in the school system is a \nstated priority of the Government. However, how best to integrate ICT in the curriculum to \nimprove learning and teaching and the investment and recurrent cost implications of enhanced \nICT provision are yet to be fully explored. Current ICT support is short term, with little prospect \nfor sustainability. The need to develop a practical, affordable, and sustainable strategy for ICT \nprovision in basic education is urgent. \n \n13.  Book Sector Development. Although textbook content is strongly influenced by the \ncurriculum,  the  quality  and  cost  of  the  final  published  textbooks  depend  on  a  range  of \nspecialized  publishing  and  production  skills,  which  include  the  editorial  and  financial \nconceptualization of textbooks and teacher guides, the identification of suitable authors, copy-\nediting,  illustration,  design,  layout  and  presentation,  pre-press,  and  production.  The \nmanagement of these specialist skills is essential for high-quality textbook publishing. While \nsignificant improvements in these areas have been achieved under the BETDP, much more \nwork  is  needed  before  textbook  quality  in  Uzbekistan  reaches  international  standards. \nUnfortunately,  local  capacity  to  support  the  rapid  upgrading  of  professional  educational \npublishing and production remains underdeveloped. With the introduction of skill-based learning \nobjectives and SCL methodologies, new textbooks and other learning materials will need to be \nprofessionally  conceived,  written,  presented,  and  produced.  Thus,  continued  professional \nsupport and capacity building is called for. \n \n14.  Other  sector  constraints  hindering  the  development  and  production  of  high-quality \ntextbooks include (i) the lack of incentives to attract the best authors to participate in writing a \nnew generation of textbooks, and (ii) the dominance of state-owned enterprises in textbook \npublishing and printing. To address the first constraint, effectiveness of implementation of the \nCopyright Law (1996) should be improved to enhance incentives and remuneration to authors. \nTo address the second constraint, administrative and procedural streamlining is needed to \nfacilitate participation by private publishers and printers. More broadly, however, the ongoing \nprivatization process should be accelerated with appropriate restructuring, and other measures \nconducive to creating an equitable environment for private sector participation. These measures \nwill lead to increased competition in the textbook sector, which will in turn improve textbook \nquality and lower prices.  ", "4 \n15.  School  Library  Development  and  Supplementary  Materials.  The  dominance  of \ndidactic, content-heavy textbooks as the main teaching/learning resource in Uzbek schools will \ncreate difficulties for developing more student-centered approaches to learning. The lack of \nrelevant,  up-to-date  supplementary  materials,  reference  books,  and  curriculum  support \nmaterials in schools inhibits project work, individual student research, working alone or in small \ngroups, and the development of wider reading around subjects. Any attempt to switch learning \noutcomes from factual recall to the development of appropriate skills will require that schools \nprovide opportunities for students to take more responsibility for their own learning. The most \nbasic and cost-effective resource required to support this fundamental switch in learning style is \na well-stocked school library.  \n \n16.  In Uzbekistan investment in school libraries has been minimal for many years, and few \nschools have the required resources and facilities to provide the more diverse learning support \nneeded.5 The change to SCL cannot be achieved easily if the only available learning resources \nare the textbook and the teacher. The situation is exacerbated by teachers\u2019 limited access to \nalternative sources of information. A good school library is as essential for teachers as it is for \nstudents. MOPE already recognizes the need for alternative learning materials to support and \ncomplement basic textbooks.  \n \n17.  If learning styles are to be changed, low cost, user-friendly, well-stocked, open access \nschool libraries need to be developed. Ideally, libraries should offer information to students in a \nvariety of media. Internet access to wider information sources through library-based computers \nis an important component of school library systems elsewhere in the world. Before a cost-\neffective ICT strategy for basic education is developed, low-cost compact disk technology could \nbe used in the short to medium term. Meanwhile efforts should be devoted to developing \nsuitable educational software in the Uzbek language.  \n \n2.  The Project Rationale \n18.  The Project will build on the foundation established by the BETDP. As the first ADB \nassistance  to  Uzbekistan  in  the  education  sector,  the  BETDP  focused  on  improving  the \navailability, quality, and durability of textbooks and other instructional materials. In particular, the \nTRS piloted under the BETDP successfully addressed the urgent shortage of textbooks that \nwas threatening the quality of, and access to, education after the Government abolished the \npolicy of providing free textbooks in 1998. The TRS has proven to be an effective mechanism \nfor providing affordable textbooks. A brief account of the experience of the TRS is in Appendix \n4.6  \n \n19.  Progress made under the BETDP also includes (i) improving physical and presentational \nquality of textbooks; (ii) revising syllabi in six subjects; (iii) introducing of a new system of \nevaluation and approval of competing textbooks; (iv) strengthening teachers\u2019 capacity through \npilot in-service training; and (v) enhancing capacity through training in publishing and printing. \nBy  improving  the  quality,  durability,  and  availability  of  textbooks  and  other  instructional \nmaterials, and enhancing the efficiency of the textbook production system, such progress has \ncontributed significantly to improving the quality of basic education.  \n \n                                                 \n5  School libraries in Uzbekistan are usually pedagogically ill-designed and equipped, with limited space, no open \naccess, and insufficient and outdated stock (a very high proportion of recorded stock, perhaps more than 90%, is \nold, irrelevant, ideologically outdated, and in Cyrillic). \n6  The financial sustainability of the TRS is demonstrated in Supplementary Appendix E.  \n    ", "5 \n20.  The Project will consolidate and expand the considerable progress achieved under the \nBETDP in several key areas. These include the need for (i) affordable textbook provision to be \nextended to all grades in all schools; (ii) institutional strengthening of the TRS mechanism to \nensure its long-term sustainability; (iii) a comprehensive curriculum review and reform, including \nreforms in examinations and assessment, and LOI practices and approaches to reduce the \nnumber of subjects and current content requirements (which will not only directly improve the \nquality and relevance of education, but also enhance sector efficiency and sustainability by \nbringing substantial cost savings in textbook provision); (iv) upgrading school libraries into \nlearning resource centers to provide learning and teaching materials that are complementary to \ntextbooks and the continued curriculum reform process, and an environment that promotes \nSCL; and (v) regulatory, institutional, and other support to strengthen the capacity of the private \nsector to participate in producing learning materials.  \n \n21.  The Project is designed to address these issues in an integrated manner. Full provision \nof affordable textbooks is a precondition for improving quality and access to basic education, \nwhere improved targeting of existing government subsidies will ensure access of the poor to all \nrequired materials. Continued curriculum reform will lead to fundamental changes in classroom \nteaching and learning methodologies, supported by a new generation of textbooks and teacher \nguides. By reducing the number of subject and content requirements, the curriculum reform will \nreduce  parental  and  government  costs  for  textbooks  and  other  learning  materials.  Such \nefficiency gains will be enhanced by increased competition in the book sector through a greater \nrole for the private sector. To support and complement these changes, adequately stocked \nschool libraries as resource centers with increasing access to ICT are particularly important \nbecause  they  provide  students  and  teachers  with  additional  means,  materials,  and  the \nnecessary environment.  \n \n3.  Government Strategy and Policy  \n22.  Since independence, the Government has given education a high priority in its reform \nagenda. This is reflected in the close attention senior government officials have paid to the \nsector and the consistently high budget allocations. The Government\u2019s strategic objective is to \ntransform the education system into one responsive to the requirements of a market economy \nand democratic society. To this end, the Government has undertaken many reform measures to \naddress the challenges identified (paras. 7\u201317), especially since the unveiling of the National \nProgram for Personnel Training in 1998. In basic education, significant achievements include (i) \na marked improvement in efficiency and cost-effectiveness in textbook provision; (ii) continuing \nprogress in curriculum reform that has led to a modest reduction in subjects for some grades; \n(iii) modernization and decentralization of the management system, including authorization for \nschools to raise and manage extrabudgetary resources, and establishment of school boards; \n(iv)  implementation  of  resource  rationalization  measures  with  regard  to  staff  and  other \nresources; and (v) provision of budget support to provide textbooks and clothing to children from \nlow income families.  \n \n23.  The NPSED 2004\u20132009 reaffirms the high priority of basic education and redirects focus \nand resources to improve basic education. The NPSED sets the priorities for the reform agenda \nover the next 5 years. They include (i) strengthening school infrastructure, especially rural \nschools, for basic education; (ii) increasing the supply of textbooks and other instructional \nmaterials,  as  well  as  computers  and  modern  laboratory  equipment;  (iii)  redesigning  and \nimproving education content by revising the present state education standards, curriculum, and \nsyllabi; (iv) strengthening teacher training and quality especially in rural areas by improving \nincentives and in-service training; and (v) encouraging private investment in basic education.  ", "6 \n4.  Asian Development Bank Support for the Education Sector  \n24.  A key objective of ADB\u2019s country strategy for Uzbekistan is to reduce the social costs of \ntransition. The education sector is a key focus. ADB\u2019s sector strategy in education follows a two-\npronged approach of (i) supporting sector policy reforms and strengthening the national capacity \nto  manage  sector  reforms,  and  (ii)  supporting  specific  efforts  to  improve  the  quality  and \nrelevance of education. In support of this approach, since 1998 ADB has provided five loans to \nthe education sector, including the BETDP in 1998, the Senior Secondary Education Project7 in \n2000, and the Education Sector Development Program (ESDP)8 in 2002. In basic education, \nADB\u2019s policy dialogue and assistance have supported the Government in addressing key sector \nissues, including curriculum reform, improving the availability and affordability of textbooks and \nlearning material production, strengthening teacher quality and development, promoting private \nsector participation, and enhancing planning and management capacities in basic education at \nall levels.  \n \n25.  While  the BETDP  has  laid  the  foundation  for  the  Project,  the  ESDP  also  provides \nimportant  support,  given  its  objectives  to  (i)  strengthen  sector  planning  and  management \ncapacities;  (ii)  improve  and  extend  teacher  education;  and  (iii)  reform  pro-poor  policy  and \nstrengthen community involvement. The ESDP, once fully implemented, will support the Project \nby providing (i) a strong and coherent sector policy framework, (ii) stronger sector institutional \ncapacity  for  the  successful  implementation  of  the  Project,  (iii)  enhanced  teacher  quality \ncomplementary to improved textbooks, and (iv) strengthened decision-making at schools.  \n \n5.  External Support \n26.  As the lead provider of financial assistance in the sector, ADB has maintained close \ncoordination with other funding agencies to ensure complementary and consistent approaches \n(Appendix 5). The United States Agency for International Development has two pilot projects \n(totaling $5 million) for improving teacher quality, teaching, equipment including computers, and \ncommunity involvement; and strengthening school management. The United Nations Children\u2019s \nFund (UNICEF) is also piloting similar support to several schools. These projects, while limited \nin scope and geographic coverage, complement ADB\u2019s assistance in testing out innovative \napproaches  and  methods  to  improve  quality  and  relevance  of  basic  education.  Recently, \nfunding agencies have enhanced coordination for basic education reforms.  \n \n6.  Lessons Learned  \n27.  Weak  Institutional  and  Implementation  Capacity.  The  absorptive  capacity  of \nexecuting agencies remains weak due to their limited experience with ADB procedures, and \ndifficulty  recruiting  and  retaining  project  and  other  professional  staff.  Personnel  with  the \nnecessary skills mix are scarce, and salaries are low. Excessively bureaucratic decision-making \nprocesses, lack of delegation of authority to project implementers, and deficient interagency \ncoordination are other features that can cause delays in key project implementation activities \nsuch as consultant recruitment, procurement of goods, and disbursements. The Project will \naddress these by (i) retaining the project management and implementation structure, including \nthe core group of the BETDP\u2019s project implementation unit (PIU); and (ii) significantly building \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2000.

A common lesson learned in textbook \nprojects by ADB and other development agencies9 is that a systems approach is necessary to \nensure  sustainability  of  development  impacts.  Successful  projects  addressed  not  only  the \ntextbook issue, but incorporated measures to improve every stage in the chain of textbook \ndevelopment, including curriculum, authorship, publishing, printing, and distribution. Based on \nthe  BETDP\u2019s  experience,  the  Project  will  support  comprehensive  curriculum  reform;  foster \nquality  authorships  for  competing  alternative  textbooks  and  supplementary  materials;  and \nstrengthen  publishing,  printing,  and  distribution  including  encouraging  private  sector \nparticipation.  \n \n29.  Targeted Government Subsidy under the Textbook Rental Scheme. Piloting of the \nTRS under the BETDP and the subsequent nationwide extension revealed that 10\u201315% of \nstudents cannot afford even the textbook rental fees, although they are several times cheaper \nthan the full textbook purchase price. The Government has a subsidy program in place in the \nform of free textbooks. The Project will develop effective and efficient measures with school and \nparent participation to improve the targeted subsidy and maximize benefits to the poor. \n \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Objective \n30.  The goal of the Project is to improve the quality of basic education. The purpose is to \nestablish  efficient  and  sustainable  nationwide  provision  of  affordable  textbooks,  and  other \ninstructional materials, supported by necessary institutional and policy reforms.  \n  \nB.  Components and Outputs \n31.  The Project comprises four components: (i) strengthening the basic education policy \nframework,  (ii)  ensuring  the  sustainable  provision  of  textbooks,  (iii)  developing  the  book \npublishing sector, and (iv) developing school libraries.  \n \n1.  Strengthening the Basic Education Policy Framework \n32.  This component will strengthen the national curriculum for basic education. Curriculum \nreform as an ongoing process has an essential impact on sector efficiency and the sustainability \nof basic education, and provides the basis for long-term enhancement of quality and relevance \nof  basic  education.  This  component  will  also  strengthen  the  national  assessment  and \nexamination  system,  which  is  necessary  to  ensure  quality  in  implementing  educational \nstandards and contents required by a modernized curriculum. A number of research studies will \nbe undertaken, focusing on key educational policy issues, including a national ICT development \nstrategy in education, and LOI practices.  \n \n                                                 \n9 ADB. 1996.

Outputs of this component will be (i) an improved national curriculum and syllabi with \ncompetency-based  learning  objectives  and  reduced  subject  and  content  requirements;  (ii) \nrevised assessment procedures and examinations to test the revised learning objectives and \noutcomes specified as part of the curriculum reform; and (iii) recommendations for a national \nICT development strategy in education, and review of issues relevant to LOI practices.  \n \n34.  Key  activities  of  the  component  will  include  (i)  establishing  a  national  curriculum \nframework working group to be charged with the main tasks of this component; (ii) training and \nbuilding capacity in curriculum reform and other related policy areas, including international \nstudy tours for working group members to provide direct contact and gain first-hand experience \nwith international and regional practices; (iii) designing and conducting national and regional \nresearch studies as part of the policy review process; (iv) developing coherent, time-bound, and \ncosted  options  for  reform  and  clear  implementation  proposals;  and  (v)  implementing \nrecommendations and proposals.  \n \n35.  The  national  curriculum  framework  working  group  will  comprise  approximately  40 \nmembers in several subgroups of domestic consultants not including MOPE staff, who will be \ndrawn from all concerned constituencies, and include practicing, experienced subject specialist \nteachers,  teacher  trainers,  methodologists,  curriculum  specialists,  subject  specialists,  and \nspecialists on ICT development in basic education and language of instruction. To ensure \nquality, this group will be appointed on a full-time basis for 12\u201321 months depending on the \nsubgroups. International consultants with expertise and experience in these areas will provide \nassistance as required. A limited amount of office equipment and administrative support will also \nbe provided to the working group.  \n \n2.  Ensuring the Sustainable Provision of Textbooks \n36.  This component will extend the TRS to grades 6, 7, and 8 to complete the coverage of \nthe TRS for all core subjects at all grade levels (except grade 1) in all schools. It will also \ndevelop and institutionalize the legal mechanism necessary to ensure financial sustainability \nand proper management of the TRS. \n \n37.  Outputs from this component will be (i) textbook supplies on all core subjects for grades \n6, 7, and 8 in all schools; (ii) free textbook provision for the poorest students through better \ntargeting  mechanisms;  (iii)  legal  establishment  and  operation  of  the  republican  textbook \nrevolving  fund  foundation  (RTRFF),  as  a  mechanism  to  ensure  long-term  and  sustainable \ntextbook provision; and (iv) decentralized, school-based decision-making on textbook selection \nand related financial and managerial matters.  \n \n38.  Key activities will include the following:  \n \n(i)  Ensure competitive selection, procurement, and distribution of core textbooks for \ngrades 6, 7, and 8, to complete the full grade level and core subject coverage of \nthe TRS established under the BETDP. Procurement will include 13.7 million \ntextbooks (20 titles) for grades 6 and 7 in 2005, accompanied by 0.6 million \nteacher guides, and 9.6 million textbooks (14 titles) for grade 8 in 2006 and 0.4 \nmillion teacher guides. \n \n(iii)  Ensure annual provision from the Government budget of textbook rental fee \nsupport to around 15% of enrolled students in the basic education system who \nare categorized as socially unprotected and cannot afford even the reduced \n    ", "9 \nrental fees. Undertake a study to clearly establish scope, locations, and effective \nmechanisms for better targeting support for the poor.  \n \n(iii)   Establish  the  RTRFF  to  assume  responsibility  for  the  proper  and  prudent \nmanagement and timely disbursement of the accumulated rental fees on behalf \nof schools and parents. A board of trustees, including representatives of MOPE, \nthe Ministry of Finance, schools, and parents will supervise the RTRFF. The \nRTRFF will not take its own decisions on the use of accumulated school rental \nfunds, but will ensure that the decisions taken by schools to order new and \nreplacement textbooks are efficiently and properly executed. The establishment \nof RTRFF is described in Appendix 6. \n \n(iv)   Design and establish a nationwide system to support school-based ordering of \nnew and replacement textbooks when competing alternative textbooks come on \nstream during the course of the Project. The system will maintain the cost-\nreducing benefits of centralized bulk purchase, and support decentralized school-\nbased decision-making. \n \n(v)   Review and amend, as required, the existing procedures and documentation for \nthe competitive submission, evaluation, and approval of textbooks and other \nlearning materials. This will ensure the procurement of high quality books and \nmaterials that are well-suited to the specified needs and requirements of the \nmodernized curriculum learning objectives and the shift to school-based ordering \nunder  the  RTRFF;  and  may  entail  revision  of  minimum  physical  production \nspecifications (set under the BETDP) to achieve durable textbooks within the \ncapacity of local and regional production facilities. \n \n(vi)   Monitor and supervise the TRS to maintain collection rates at the level required \nto ensure its long-term financial sustainability.  \n \n3.  Developing the Book Publishing Sector \n39.   This component will continue the process, begun under the BETDP, of upgrading skills \nin the chain of textbook and learning material development including authorship, publishing, \nproduction, and distribution. Specifically, it will provide financial and technical support for the \ndevelopment of short-term, in-service book sector skills training at a selected local educational \ninstitution; the goal is to establish permanent local training capacity in the full range of skills \nrequired  for  book  publishing  and  the  development  of  other  educational  materials.  The \ncomponent will also seek to create conditions for a more active private sector role in the book \nsector, including the improvement of incentives and remuneration for quality authorship, and \nequal access to the textbook market by private sector publishers and printers.  \n \n40.  Outputs  of  this  component  will  be  (i)  a  sustainable  institutional  base  for  continued \nupgrading of professional, commercial, and management skills in book sector development; (ii) \nstrengthened capacity in authorship and publishing through workshops and training; and (iii) \nincreased  representation  of  private  publishers  on  the  MOPE-approved  book  lists  and \nprocurement contracts for textbooks and other materials under the Project. \n \n41.  Key activities will include (i) establishing a permanent base for capacity building at a \nlocal public educational institution selected by the Government; (ii) developing and conducting \nshort training courses on the full range of educational book development skills; (iii) reviewing ", "10 \npublishing licensing procedures for textbooks and related regulatory barriers to the publishing \nindustry, and making recommendations for their improvement; (iv) reviewing current regulations, \npractices, and incentives for educational authors and publishers; and making recommendations \nfor their improvement; and (v) supporting implementation of recommendations approved by the \nGovernment. Policy review and recommendations, and other related advisory work and capacity \nbuilding will be mainly conducted by locally selected consultants with expertise in these areas \nunder the guidance and assistance of international experts. Limited equipment will be provided \nto the host institution selected for capacity building. \n \n4.  Developing School Libraries \n42.  This component will strengthen and develop school libraries as resource centers for \nlearning and teaching. Well-equipped and well-stocked school libraries providing study spaces \nfor  approximately  10%  of  school  enrolment  will  be  important  for  upgrading  the  quality  of \neducation in Uzbekistan. They will provide (i) alternative sources of information, which to date \nhas been dominated by textbooks; (ii) necessary facilities and environment for the development \nof  student  research,  project  work,  and  independent  learning;  and  (iii)  key  methodological \nsupport  for  introducing  and  nurturing  a  more  interactive  SCL  approach.  In  addition,  well-\ndeveloped school libraries contribute significantly to long-term system cost reduction. Given the \nimportance of modernized school libraries, the NPSED 2004\u20132009 has made improvement of \nthe school library system nationwide a priority. \n \n43.  Outputs from this component will be (i) national guidelines for school library system \nimprovement; (ii) 1,000 refurbished, upgraded, and well-stocked school libraries (10% of the \ntotal);  and  (iii)  improvement  of  skills  through  training  of  1,000  school  librarians  and  200 \noblast/raion specialists. In addition, management and monitoring of textbook use under the TRS \nwill be strengthened in each library. Selected school libraries must (i) include at least 40% from \npoor  and  rural  raions,  with  some  from  minority  language  schools;  and  (ii)  have  strong \ncommitment and support from their local governments and communities. (An outline of selection \ncriteria for working groups and school library development is in Appendix 7).  \n \n44.  Key activities under this component will include (i) developing national guidelines for \nschool  library  systems,  training  materials,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation  schemes;  (ii) \nconducting a base-line study of teaching/learning styles and performance in a number of skills \nand aptitudes prior to or shortly after the introduction of modernized school libraries, with follow-\nup studies to be administered every 2 years to measure improvement in learning/teaching styles \nand performance levels over time; (iii) refurbishing, furnishing, and upgrading 1,000 pilot school \nlibraries in accordance with national standards; (iv) providing basic audiovisual equipment to the \nupgraded  school  libraries;  (v)  publishing,  via  competitive  selection,  about  700  specially \ndeveloped school library titles that are well spread among grade levels and subject areas and \ndesigned  to  support  student  reading  and  research  in  accordance  with  modernized  state \neducation standards, curriculum, and syllabi; (vi) developing software in Uzbek language via \ngrants awarded on a bidding basis; (vii) training a cadre of library professionals and teachers, \nwho will undertake raion-based training of library methodologists and school librarians; and (viii) \nmonitoring, supervising and evaluating the school library development. Local experts assisted \nby international consultants will be employed to review and prepare relevant national policies, \nand  to  provide  capacity  building  and  monitor  implementation  in  these  areas.  Furniture, \nequipment including ICT equipment, and stocks of library materials will be provided to pilot \nschool  libraries.  The  Government  will  fund  and  undertake  minor  rehabilitation  of  selected \nlibraries, where necessary. \n \n    ", "11 \nC.  Special Features \n45.  Pro-Poor Design. The Project will improve affordability and availability of textbooks to \nthe poor. Under the TRS, about 15% of students cannot afford the rental fees. While the Project \nwill extend the scheme to cover all grades (2\u20139) in all schools, it will also develop measures and \nmechanisms to improve the Government\u2019s subsidy program by improving targeting of the poor. \nThis is envisaged to be implemented through a combination of geographic targeting and more \neffective delivery mechanisms with participation of teacher-parent councils and the Mahalla \n(local community) system. The Project will also ensure that of the 1,000 schools to be selected \nfor library improvement, at least 40% are in poor regions. (A recommendation to MOPE on \nimprovement of school libraries is in Supplementary Appendix A.)  \n \n46.  Institutional Change and Decentralization. The Project will institutionalize the TRS by \nestablishing the RTRFF. As the apex organization, the RTRFF will take charge of the financial \nand  management  responsibilities  required  to  ensure  sustainable  and  affordable  nationwide \ntextbook provision under the supervision of a board including representatives of Government, \nschools, and parents. Nationwide, schools and parents will be accountable for making decisions \nconcerning textbooks (particularly after competing alternative textbooks come on stream) and \nother related educational and financial matters. By supporting a shift from the current mainly \ncentralized  and  supply-determined  system  to  decentralized  and  demand-driven  decision-\nmaking, the RTRFF will further the empowerment process begun under the BETDP.  \n \n47.  Community Involvement and Participatory Approach. The Project\u2019s design followed \na participatory approach, with the full participation of all stakeholders including oblast and raion \neducation departments, Hakimyats (local executive branch of the government), school directors, \nteachers, parents, and Mahalla representatives, as well as ministries of central Government \n(Supplementary Appendix B). This took various forms including participatory rural appraisal \ntechniques  to  consult  with  the  poor,  regular  planning  workshops,  presentations,  and \nconsultation. The Project will continue the emphasis on full participation during implementation, \nincluding a national publicity campaign on extending the TRS and strengthening community and \nparent involvement in management of the TRS and the RTRFF.  \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n48.  The total cost of the Project is estimated at $55 million equivalent, including physical and \nprice contingencies, taxes and duties, and interest and other charges. Of the total cost, $23.8 \nmillion (43%) comprises the foreign exchange cost, and $31.2 million equivalent (57%) the local \ncurrency cost. The indicative project cost estimates by component are summarized in Table 1 \nand summary cost estimates by expense category are in Appendix 8.  \n \nE.   Financing Plan \n49.  The Government has requested a loan of $25 million equivalent from ADB\u2018s ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a \ngrace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, and \nsuch other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The Government has \nprovided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices \nwere its own independent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice \nfrom ADB. ADB will finance 45% of the project cost, including 100% of the foreign exchange ", "12 \ncost  and  2%  of  the  local  cost.  The  Government  will  finance  the  remaining  $30.0  million \nequivalent of local costs (Table 2).

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n50.  MOPE will be the Executing Agency for the Project. The project steering committee \n(PSC) established for the BETDP will be maintained for the Project as the decision-making body \nresponsible  for  overall  project  coordination. Appointed  by  the  Cabinet  of  Ministers  (COM), \nmembers  of  the  PSC  are  from  the  COM,  MOPE,  Ministry  of  Finance,  and  other  related \ngovernment agencies. The PSC will meet quarterly to review project implementation status, \ndiscuss implementation issues, provide broad guidance, ensure coordination among different \nagencies, resolve issues, and review and advise on the annual implementation plan.  \n \n51.  MOPE will appoint a deputy minister as project director. The project director will provide \ngeneral guidance to the PIU in accordance with decisions made by the PSC; will arrange the \nquarterly meetings of, and present quarterly reports to PSC; and ensure coordination of project \nimplementation within MOPE. The project director will be responsible for MOPE policy inputs \ninto the Project.  \n    ", "13 \n52.  A  project  manager  will  be  recruited  to  report  to  the  project  director,  and  will  be \nresponsible for coordinating and supervising the work of the PIU. The PIU, which will comprise \nthe project manager and 6 staff, will be responsible for day-to-day project implementation, \nincluding  financial  management.  The  PIU  is  responsible  for  preparing  the  detailed  project \nimplementation plan and will provide annual reports and quarterly progress reports to the PSC, \nthe project director, and ADB. The PIU will manage and implement all four project components, \nalthough some activities may be subcontracted to specialist agencies within MOPE. The PIU will \nmaintain  four  sections:  procurement,  staff  development,  financial  and  accounting,  and \nmonitoring and evaluation. Not all sections will require full-time positions. The monitoring and \nevaluation section will work closely with the Education Reform Implementation and Monitoring \nUnit of the COM. The PIU will occupy the premises of the current PIU for the BETDP and will to \nthe extent possible take on the staff of that PIU, who have extensive relevant experience and a \ngood track record in successfully implementing the BETDP. The experience accumulated by the \nBETDP\u2019s PIU will be essential to the success of the Project. A project management chart is in \nAppendix 10. ADB's experience with MOPE through the BETDP indicates that it has sufficient \nfinancial management capacity and the proposed PIU structure is appropriate to support sound \nfinancial management and effective and efficient use of project resources. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n53.  The Project will be implemented over 5 years, from January 2005 to December 2009. A \nproject implementation schedule is in Appendix 11. \n \n3.  Procurement \n54.  The Project will procure textbooks and related materials for grades 6, 7, and 8; furniture, \naudio/video equipment; library books, materials, and ICT equipment for school libraries; and \nfurniture  and  computers  for  office  and  administrative  use.  ADB  loan-financed  goods  and \nservices  will  be  procured  following  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Selected  supply \ncontracts  for  furniture,  equipment,  textbooks,  library  books,  and  supporting  instructional \nmaterials may be awarded on the basis of local competitive bidding acceptable to ADB.10 The \nGovernment will finance and undertake necessary civil works, in particular to rehabilitate and \nupgrade school libraries. Rehabilitation work will not involve resettlement or have a negative \nenvironmental impact. \n \n55.  The Government has been advised that ADB policy requires the borrower (including \nbeneficiaries of ADB loans), bidders, suppliers, and contractors under ADB-financed contracts, \nto observe the highest standards of ethics during the procurement and execution of such \ncontracts. Indicative procurement packages are in Appendix 12. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n56.  The Project will require 937 person-months of consulting services, consisting of 61 \nperson-months of international and 876 person-months of domestic consulting. Because of the \nhighly integrated nature of the project components, international consultants will be engaged \nthrough a firm using quality and cost-based selection in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants.

Learning materials other than \ntextbooks and computer software costing, in the aggregate, less than $100,000, may be procured through direct \npurchase. ", "14 \n13.  Domestic  consultants  with  relevant  expertise  in  areas  including  curriculum  reform, \nassessment  and  testing,  and  LOI  practices  will  be  selected  using  selection  procedures \nsatisfactory to ADB (Outline terms of reference for domestic consultants are in Supplementary \nAppendix C). An outline of the staff development (training) program and research studies is in \nSupplementary Appendix D.  \n \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n57.  The proposed ADB loan will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook. If Government funds are first used for eligible expenditures, ADB's reimbursement \nprocedure will be applied. The Government requested the establishment of an imprest account \nto expedite loan disbursement, with a ceiling of $150,000. Statement of expenditure procedure \nwill be used to liquidate/replenish the imprest account and to reimburse eligible expenditures. \nThe statement of expenditure ceiling will be $20,000.  \n \n58.  Based on the accumulated experience and proven competence of the BETDP\u2019s PIU, \ncore staff of that PIU will be maintained and contracted through direct selection using advanced \nrecruitment action. Because the BETDP closes on 30 September 2004, the Government has \nasked  ADB  for  retroactive  financing  to  cover  the  PIU  operational  expenditures  from  1 \nSeptember 2004 to the loan effective date. The Government has also requested advance \nprocurement action for office equipment for the curriculum working group (including subgroups) \nand for office equipment and a vehicle for the PIU. The advance action will be undertaken in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  The  total  amount  under  retroactive \nfinancing is estimated at not more than $100,000. The Government was advised that ADB\u2019s \napproval of advance action and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to financing the \nProject. \n \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n59.  MOPE will maintain separate accounts for project components financed by ADB and the \nGovernment,  and  will  prepare  financial  statements  according  to  international  accounting \nstandards.  MOPE  will  have  the  project  accounts  and  related  financial  statements  audited \nannually by independent auditors with adequate qualification, knowledge, and experience in \ninternational accounting practices acceptable to ADB. Certified copies of the audited project \naccounts and financial statements, as well as the auditor\u2019s reports including a separate audit \nopinion on the use of the imprest account and statement of expenditure procedures will be \nsubmitted to ADB within 6 months of the end of each financial year. The Government was \nadvised  of  ADB\u2019s  requirement  for  the  timely  submission  of  audited  project  accounts  and \nfinancial statements, including the suspension of disbursements in case of noncompliance. \n \n60.  MOPE will prepare and submit to ADB quarterly reports in English and in a format \nacceptable to ADB on progress made and problems encountered during the period under \nreview, the steps taken or proposed to remedy problems encountered during the quarter, and \nthe proposed activities and expected progress during the following period. Within 3 months of \nphysical completion of the Project, MOPE will submit a project completion report to ADB to \nfacilitate postevaluation of the Project. The project completion report will provide details about \nimplementation, costs, benefits, and other information requested by ADB.  \n \n    ", "15 \n7.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n61.  In addition to targets specified in the project framework, systematic monitoring and \nevaluation  will  be  developed  and  undertaken  during  project  implementation.  Prior  to  loan \nnegotiations, MOPE and ADB agreed on a set of indicators for monitoring and evaluating project \nperformance in relation to its goals, purposes, and outputs (Appendix 14). The baseline values \nof the indicators will be established prior to project implementation. Monitoring indicators will be \nmeasured,  with  the  necessary  frequency,  during  project  implementation.  Comments  and \nfindings on these indicators will be incorporated in every other quarterly report to ADB. In \naddition to indicators for implementation monitoring, indicators for project evaluation will be \nmeasured at project completion and 3 years after completion. Where feasible and appropriate, \nthese data should be disaggregated by gender. Close coordination between the PIU and the \nEducation  Reform  Implementation  and  Monitoring  Unit  will  be  crucial  as  the  latter  has \nestablished  branches  in  all  oblasts  and  is  affiliated  with  the  COM.  At  project  inception, \ncompletion, and 3 years after completion, MOPE will submit to ADB a report that summarizes \nthe key findings of monitoring and evaluation of changes that occurred in the 3 preceding years. \n \n8.  Project Review \n62.  In addition to regular twice-annual reviews of the Project, comprehensive reviews of \nproject performance will be conducted at the end of the first and third years of implementation, \ngiven that much of the policy research and advisory work will be carried out during the first \nyears of implementation. The first comprehensive review will focus on the success of policy \nadvisory work and implementation arrangements. The second (midterm) review will (i) review \nthe scope, design, and implementation arrangements of the Project; (ii) identify any changes \nrequired since the time of project appraisal; (iii) assess progress of project implementation \nagainst  performance  indicators;  (iv)  establish  compliance  with  loan  covenants;  and  (v)  if \nnecessary, recommend changes in the design or implementation arrangements. The paper and \nequipment revolving funds established under the National Bank of Uzbekistan11 are an integral \npart of the Government and ADB\u2019s approach to developing the textbook sector. Given that the \neffective functioning of the revolving funds is essential to the successful development of the \ntextbook sector being supported by the Project, it will be a subject of review in all project \nreviews. \n \n9.  Anticorruption Measures \n63.  The  Mission  explained  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy  to  Government  officials  and \nhighlighted paragraphs 1.06 to 1.08 of ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement on issues concerning \nfraud  and  corruption.  The  Government  agreed  to  include  the  relevant  sections  of  ADB\u2019s \nanticorruption policy in all documents and contracts during bidding for and implementation of the \nProject. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Project Benefits and Beneficiaries \n64.  Direct Beneficiaries. The Project will benefit 6 million students annually in grades 2\u20139 \nby reducing parental contributions to the cost of textbooks. Of these students, 27.5% are from \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 1997. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nRepublic of Uzbekistan for the Basic Education Textbook Development Project. Manila. (see Footnote 3).  ", "16 \npoor families and 6.6% are from ethnic minority groups.12 The provision of supplementary \nreading materials and school libraries will be targeted to ensure that 40% of beneficiaries will be \nschools from poor regions. Secondary beneficiaries will include 160,000 teachers and about \n1,200 school librarians and specialists who will receive new teacher guides and formal in-\nservice training in the use of new textbooks and the new school library facilities. In addition, 40 \ncurriculum developers and assessment specialists, 270 textbook evaluators, a new generation \nof textbook authors and publishers, and the printing industry will benefit from training in modern \ntechniques in their respective professional areas. The provision of basic ICT capacity in 1,000 \nschool libraries will help to develop new and sustainable policies for any future ICT investments \nin the sector. \n \n65.  Educational Benefits. The key role of textbooks as one of the most important factors \ndetermining student performance is well established. The most important educational benefit of \nthe Project will derive from the completion and establishment of the TRS and the establishment \nof the RTRFF, which will ensure the sustainable provision of core textbooks for every grade \nlevel  to  every  student  in  the  country  at  affordable  prices.  The  provision  of  targeted  TRS \nsubsidies by the Government will ensure that the full range of textbooks will also be available to \npoor students.  \n \n66.  The design of an improved and more relevant curriculum will introduce new skill and \ncompetency-based  learning  objectives,  oriented  more  precisely  to  the  needs  of  a  market-\noriented,  democratic  society.  The  new  curriculum  will  encourage  students  to  take  more \nresponsibility for their own learning, and will aim to develop higher order thinking and problem-\nsolving skills and the ability to apply acquired knowledge. A reduced content burden will allow \nfor more classroom time to be devoted to understanding rather than rote learning and for more \nproductive  interaction  between  teaching  staff  and  students.  The  development  of  new  and \nimproved textbooks, combined with the introduction of upgraded school libraries will support the \nintroduction of SCL and teaching methodologies. The upgraded school libraries will contain a \nwider collection of reading, supplementary, reference, and curriculum support materials in a \nvariety of media. The provision of library-based computers with Internet access will also widen \nthe scope of information available to students and teachers. Thus, the library development \ncomponent  will  provide  genuine  opportunities  for  individual  and  small  groups  working  and \nconducting research, which in turn will encourage wider reading and thinking around curriculum \nsubjects and the ability of students to explore and develop their own interests. \n \n67.  Reform of the assessment system will ensure that the new learning objectives can be \nadequately tested and is expected to lead to more open, fair, and transparent summative \nassessments. The development of formative tests will enable the more accurate measurement \nof  system  progress  toward  defined  educational  goals.  An  assessment  of  the  current  LOI \npractices  will  provide  the  basis  for  supporting  improved  educational  quality  and  equity  in \nminority language schools. The Project will also support the training of a cadre of curriculum, \nassessment, and LOI specialists; and will train over 1,200 librarians and specialists in the use of \nupgraded school libraries and a wide range of supplementary materials. Maintenance and \nteacher support facilities in the effective use of ICT will be developed in all raions. \n \n68.  Financial and Economic Analysis. Under normal assumptions, including that on the \ncollection  rate  and  based  on  experience  of  the  piloting  and  subsequent  partial  national \nextension under the BETDP during 2000\u20132003, the TRS will be financially sustainable, i.e., the \naccumulated textbook rental fees over the 4 years of the replacement cycle will be sufficient to \n                                                 \n12   World Bank. 2003. Uzbekistan: Living Standards Assessment.  Washington, D.C. \n    ", "17 \ncover the cost of replacing the textbooks. With regard to fiscal impact, the total Government \ncommitment to externally funded projects in education, including $30 million to the Project and \nother commitments (mainly to the ESDP and  the Senior Secondary Education Project), is \ncompared  with  the  annual  education  budget  for  the  years  2005\u20132009,  with  two  scenarios \ndepending on projections of budget revenue. In both cases, Government commitments are \ndeemed  affordable  and  sustainable:  in  the  high-case  scenario  the  Government\u2019s  annual \ncommitment as a percentage of the education budget ranges from 5.4% to 2.8%, averaging \n3.6% over the 5-year life of the Project; while in the low case scenario, it ranges from 5.2% to \n3.9%, averaging 4.3% over the 5-year life of the Project. The annual recurrent costs of the three \nprojects combined are only 0.1% of the annual education recurrent budget for both high and low \ncase scenarios.  \n \n69.  While total economic costs of the Project consist of textbook rental fees paid by the \nparents  and  the  total  project  cost,  the  Project  will  bring  substantial  economic  benefits. \nQuantifiable economic benefits derive from several sources. First, curriculum reform is expected \nto reduce the number of textbooks thereby reducing the price of the textbook set for each grade. \nSecond, the provision of textbooks under the TRS to grades 6, 7, and 8 will bring significant \nbenefits to students and parents as the rental fees are four times cheaper than full textbook \npurchase prices. Third, increasing competition in the book sector is expected to bring efficiency \ngains  that  will  be  reflected  largely  in  lower  prices  of  textbooks,  further  reducing  parents\u2019 \ncontributions to rental fees. The sum of these quantifiable economic benefits under reasonable \nassumptions will far outweigh the total economic costs. The economic internal rate of return of \nthe Project is calculated to be 30%. The resulting net economic benefits will be enhanced by \nsignificant nonquantifiable economic benefits that the Project will impart (a fuller analysis is in \nSupplementary Appendix E). \n \n70.  Poverty Impact. Recent data indicate that 27.5% of the population or 6.8 million people, \nlive at or below the poverty line and nearly 70% of all poor reside in rural areas.13 The Project \nwill contribute to poverty reduction by improving the quality of, and access to, basic education \nfor students in grades 2\u20139. The Project will address the issue of access to basic education for \nthe poorest pupils by  developing an effective mechanism for providing targeted rental fee \nsubsidies in the form of free textbooks for the poorest pupils nationwide. Forty percent of the \n1,000 upgraded school libraries will be selected from schools in poor regions, which will lead to \nhigher educational achievement of pupils in poor schools. Curriculum reform is expected to lead \nto  further  cost  reduction  via  reduced  rental  fee  charges  for  textbooks  and  other  learning \nmaterials, which is one of the major barriers to participation by poor students (Appendix 15). \n \n71.  Social Dimension. The Project will contribute to the accumulation of human capital, \nwhich is essential for higher incomes, and reduces poverty and vulnerability of the poor. The \nProject  will  increase  community  participation  in  financial  and  managerial  accountability, \nincluding in the allocation of rental fee financial support to the poorest. The Project will ensure \nthat ethnic minority students speaking Russian and Karakalpak will benefit from continued \naccess to instructional materials. The current situation with regard to LOI practices will be \nassessed  and  recommendations  will  be  provided  to  minimize  costs  and  improve  future \nemployment opportunities for ethnic minorities. The Project will continue to mainstream gender \nequity based on progress made under the BETDP through universal textbook provision, and by \ncorrecting gender stereotyping and bias in textbook development. \n \n                                                 \n13  ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Uzbekistan for Developing a Comprehensive Medium-Term \nStrategy for Improving the Living Standards of the People of Uzbekistan and Living Standards Assessment. Manila. ", "18 \n72.  Environmental and Social Safeguards. The Project will involve minor library repair and \ninternal refurbishing, with no negative environmental or resettlement impact. The Project will \nenhance access and equity for ethnic minorities by providing textbooks and other teaching \nmaterials in Russian and Karakalpak languages for ethnic minorities.  \n \nB.  Risks \n73.  The  Project  faces  sector,  financial,  institutional,  and  coordination  risks  that  are \noutweighed by the benefits and impacts. \n \n74.  Sector Risk. The Project is designed in the context of and supports the education sector \nreforms being implemented by the Government. A reversal or slowdown of the sector reforms \ncould have an adverse impact on the Project. To mitigate such systemic risk, ADB will continue \nto assist with sector reform and management. As the major provider of financial assistance in \nthe education sector, ADB has pursued a consistent strategy of policy dialogue supported with \nassistance in key areas. This strategy has yielded demonstrable results. The recently unveiled \nNPSED 2004\u20132009 is also a clear indication of the Government\u2019s commitment to continuing \nreform and strengthening basic education.  \n \n75.  Financial Risk. The financial sustainability of the TRS, a key component of the Project, \nwill depend on (i) maintaining a collection rate sufficient for replacing textbooks at regular \nintervals,  and  (ii)  managing  the  accumulated  rental  fees.  The  RTRFF  will  be  established \nspecifically  to  address  this  risk  by  ensuring  professional  management  of  the  rental  fees \naccumulated under the TRS, and systematic supervision and monitoring at central, oblast, \nraion, and school levels. Experience with national extension in the past 2 years in Uzbekistan, \nand  in  other  countries,  highlights  the  crucial  importance  of  the  RTRFF  in  maintaining  the \nfinancial sustainability of textbook provision. Experience of the BETDP\u2019s PIU, which will be \napplied to implementing the Project, will contribute significantly to mitigating this risk.  \n \n76.  Institutional  and  Coordination  Risk.  Successful  project  implementation  requires \nsignificant institutional capacity for the Government to ensure effective coordination among \ncentral  agencies  and  at  all  levels  of  government.  Such  coordination  will  be  essential  to \nextending the TRS, as calendar deadlines of school years must be met to provide textbooks on \ntime. Similarly, syllabus revision resulting from curriculum reform must be synchronized with the \ntextbook replacement cycles to avoid unnecessary redundancies. With regard to school library \nimprovement, physical repair of libraries, refurbishing, equipment provision, and library book \nprovision  must  be  well  sequenced  and  carried  out  by  different  agencies.  In  addition, \ncoordination is needed between the Project and teacher training component of the ESDP. This \ninstitutional and coordination risk will be mitigated by (i) building on the experience at all levels \nof government including the PIU, gained from implementation of the BETDP; (ii) improving \ncoordination and monitoring ability resulting from ADB past assistance including the Education \nReform  Implementation  and  Monitoring  Unit  at  COM;  (iii)  enhancing  efficiency  result  from \nGovernment implementation of the NPSED 2004\u20132009; and (iv) continuing MOPE efforts to \nbuild mechanisms for better coordination between the Project and the ESDP. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES  \nA.  Government Assurances  \n77.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n    ", "19 \n78.  Government Counterpart Funding. The Government will allocate in a timely manner \nadequate funding in the budget for (i) the Government\u2019s share of procurement of textbooks for \nthe school years of 2005/06 and 2006/07 under the Project; (ii) support under the TRS for \ntextbooks for those socially unprotected who cannot afford the textbook rental fees; (iii) the \nrehabilitation and provision of furniture for the 1,000 pilot school libraries according to the \nProject\u2019s  implementation  schedule;  and  (iv)  incremental  recurrent  costs  for  operation  and \nmaintenance of the refurbished and modernized pilot school libraries. \n \n79.  Curriculum Reform and Textbook Development. The Government will ensure that (i) \nthe  curriculum  framework  working  group  is  established  by  1  February  2005;  and  (ii)  the \nintroduction  of  new  syllabi  will  synchronize  with  textbook  replacement  cycles  to  avoid \nunnecessary redundancy, with new syllabi for grades 4 and 5 completed by September 2006 \nand introduced by September 2007, and other revised grade level syllabi following annually.  \n \n80.  Establishment  of  Republican  Textbook  Revolving  Fund  Foundation.  The \nGovernment will (i) issue a formal decision on the establishment of the RTRFF by 15 December \n2004, as an independent legal entity in the form of a noncommercial republican foundation, to \nmanage the rental fees accumulated under the TRS, and textbook procurement and distribution \npursuant to orders placed by schools, operating on principles of transparency, accountability, \nparticipation by schools and parents, and financial prudence, as agreed upon with ADB; (ii) by \n30 January 2005 register the RTRFF charter with consultation and agreement of ADB prior to its \nregistration; and (iii) ensure that the RTRFF will be fully operational by 1 February 2005.  \n \n81.  The RTRFF will be governed by a board of trustees, whose composition should include \nrepresentatives of parent councils, the Mahalla system, school administrations, oblast/raion \npublic education departments, MOPE, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Economy, Ministry of \nJustice, and the Central Bank of Uzbekistan. ADB will be an observer on the board of trustees. \nThe board of trustees will appoint RTRFF management. \n \n82.  School Library Development. The Government will approve the selection of 1,000 pilot \nschool libraries under the Project by the end of 2005 according to the criteria agreed upon with \nADB\u2014125 will be identified by the completion of physical improvements before the start of \nschool year 2005/06.  \n \n83.  The Government will ensure that physical improvement of pilot school libraries will (i) \ntake place prior to procurement of equipment for libraries; (ii) be closely coordinated with \nimplementation of other relevant project components, and follow designs agreed to by ADB to \nmeet  requirements  of  subsequent  improvements;  and  (iii)  have  no  negative  environmental \nimpact or land acquisition or resettlement implications. \n \n84.  Book  Sector  Development.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  provisions  of  the \nCopyright Law (1996) will be effectively implemented and in particular author remunerations are \ndetermined between publishers and authors according to relevant provisions of the law. \n \n85.  The Government will ensure that any interested publisher and printer satisfying criteria \nlaid out by the bidding documents under the Project will be allowed to participate in the bidding. \n \n86.  The Government will continue to take timely and effective measures to improve the \npolicy and regulatory framework of the book sector in order to enhance competition and private \nsector growth. Progress in this regard will be a subject of specific review by ADB and the \nGovernment within 1 year after the loan becomes effective. ", "20 \n87.  National  Guidelines  for  School  Libraries.  By  the  end  of  2005,  MOPE  will  adopt  \nnational guidelines for the school library system developed by the Project.  \n \n88.  Pro-Poor Targeted Subsidy. The Government will adopt measures by the end of 2005 \nfor improving targeted subsidy to the poorest under the TRS including more effective delivery \nmechanisms with the participation of teachers, parents, and Mahalla system, based on the \nrecommendations of a study that will be completed under the Project by September 2005.  \n \n89.  Coordination  between  the  Education  Sector  Development  Program  and  the \nProject. The Government will appoint the same director for the Project and the ESDP to \nstrengthen effective coordination during implementation of the two projects.  \n \nB.  Conditions for Disbursement \n90.  The  Government\u2019s  full  compliance  with  the  assurance  on  the  establishment  of  the \nRTRFF as specified in paras. 80\u201381 will be a condition for disbursement for procurement of \ntextbooks and other instructional materials.  \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n91.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nADB  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of  $25  million  to  the  Republic  of \nUzbekistan  for  the  Second  Textbook  Development  Project  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending \nfacility; a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement \npresented to the Board.  \n \n \n \nTadao Chino \nPresident \n \n3 September 2004 \n \n \n    ", "    Appendix 1  21\nPROJECT FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nSummary  Indicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \nGoal  \u2022 Satisfactory ratings  \u2022 National human   \nImprovement of quality  for grade 5 based on  development statistics; net \nof basic education   the new system  enrolment ratios and \n  introduced will rise by  attendance rates, \n2010  particularly for the poorest \n  (2005, 2007, and 2010) \n\u2022  Improvements in   \nnational average  \u2022 National testing scores \nattendance rates by  and/or tracer studies using \n2010  2005 as base year.

The Government\u2019s stated long-term reform goal for education is to transform the system \ninto one that is consistent with a market-oriented economy and a democratic society in the 21st \ncentury. To realize this aspiration, basic education as a subsector faces the key challenge to \nimprove quality and relevance, as analyzed in the following (a problem tree is attached).  \n \n2.  Governance and Institutional Constraints. As a priority in the overall government \nreform agenda, basic education has received significant fiscal and other support over the past \ndecade and managed to avoid the dramatic decline in enrolment witnessed in some transition \ncountries. However, within an overall highly centralized bureaucratic system, basic education, \nlike other subsectors, is still largely governed by rigid norms set by the central Government. For \nexample, most items in the annual school budgets are fixed and schools have discretionary \nspending authority over only a small portion of the budget. In all subjects taught, programs and \nstandards set by the central Government strictly dictate the contents and time allocated for the \nsubjects,  leaving  inadequate  freedom  for  schools  to  adjust  to  student  needs  and  local \nconditions. State norms fix student-teacher ratios countrywide, and schools have neither power \nnor budgetary incentives to strive for optimal use of existing resources. As a result, the system \ndoes not encourage nor support capacity building in planning and management skills. While the \nMahalla  (local  community)  system  has  played  an  important  role  as  part  of  the  overall \ngovernment social protection system, community participation and involvement in key decision-\nmaking remains limited.  \n \n3.  To address equity concerns and protect the poor, the Government has allocated fiscal \nsupport for the free provision of textbooks and clothing for the poorest 15% of the school \npopulation. At present, this support is inadequately targeted because of the practical difficulties \nin providing compensatory budget support for areas with higher than average levels of poverty. \nThe problem is also due to the unavailability of poverty indicators for raions and school, which \nare necessary to achieve better targeting.  \n \n4.  Currently, the private sector does not participate in the provision of basic education. \nState-owned  enterprises  dominate  publishing  and  printing  of  textbooks  and  educational \nmaterials. The nascent and weak private sector and the emergence of a competitive educational \nbook market could benefit a great deal from continuing privatization, but first, the Government \nmust accelerate efforts to create an equitable environment and improved access for private \nsector involvement in the textbook market. Growing competition in this subsector would lead to \nincreased external efficiency through higher quality and lower prices of textbooks and other \neducational materials.  \n \n5.  Curriculum and Other Educational Policies. Curriculum reform has been ongoing \nsince 1991 and progress has been made in reforming state education standards and in reducing \nthe number of subjects and the amount of specified content for the school year 2003/04. \nOverall, the curriculum remains overloaded with an undue emphasis on factual memorization \nand on repetitive exercises rather than on the development of key skills and competencies. An \noverloaded  curriculum  reinforces  didactic  teacher-centered  classroom  approaches  at  the \nexpense  of  student-centered  learning  methodologies  because  teachers  must  rush  through \nclasses to meet to meet the heavy content requirements, leaving no time for interaction with and \namong students. Such a curriculum also has high cost implications as each subject requires a \ntextbook and each book has far too much extent. As the cornerstone of an education system ", "30  Appendix 3 \nsuitable for the new millennium, comprehensive curriculum reform is needed as the centerpiece \nof the reform agenda for basic education. \n \n6.  A modernized assessment and testing system is integral to the system to ensure the \nquality of basic education. At present, tests in schools are graded by individual teachers in the \nlower grades and noneffective national tests prior to graduation. Under such a system, no \neffective and reliable way is available to assess and compare the quality of basic education \nprovided  on  a  national,  oblast,  raion,  or  school  basis,  and  no  way  to  compare  student \nperformance year-on-year or internationally. Existing assessment and testing practices need to \nbe modernized, together with curriculum reform to ensure an effective, fair, and transparent \nsystem that will support improvements in the quality and relevance of basic education.  \n \n7.  The current language of instruction (LOI) policy guarantees the rights of ethnic minorities \nto education in Russian, Karakalpak, Kazakh, Tajik, Kyrgyz, and Turkmen, in addition to Uzbek. \nThe  Government  has  struggled  to  maintain  this  policy  by  providing  subsidies  for  minority \nlanguage textbook publishing especially in times of fiscal strains. Reform of LOI policies will help \nensure greater equity in the provision of education to the different national language groups and \nwill also contribute to overall system cost reduction. \n \n8.  Information and Communication Technology (ICT) development in the school system is \nalso a stated priority of the Government as a central requirement for human development and \neducation provision in the 21st century. However, how ICT development can and should be \nintegrated in the curriculum to improve learning and teaching is unclear. In addition, huge \ninvestment and recurrent cost implications of this policy requirement are yet to be fully explored \nand understood. Present ICT support is mostly driven by funding agencies and short-term \nbased, with little or no concern for longer-term financial sustainability. A practical, affordable and \nsustainable strategy for ICT development in schools is urgently needed. \n \n9.  Learning and Teaching Materials. Textbooks are the dominant means of learning and \nteaching and thus the key material input in influencing quality and relevance of basic education. \nIn former Soviet times and prior to 1998, the Government provided textbooks. Due to increasing \nfiscal and financial strains, the Government decided to cease the free provision of textbooks and \nadopted the policy of user charges. Immediately afterwards, textbooks were in short supply \nbecause the majority of parents could not afford to buy them. The textbook rental scheme (TRS) \nsuccessfully  introduced  in  2000  effectively  addressed  the  affordability  issue  by  reducing \nparental expenditure on textbooks to a rental fee. The fee was approximately 5 times cheaper \nthan the total purchase price of a set of textbooks from the market. The TRS was subsequently \nextended nationwide to cover grades 2\u20135 and 9, with national coverage of grade 2\u20139 to be \ncompleted by the end of 2007. Further cost savings in basic textbook provision could be \nachieved by reducing textbook requirements; this could be achieved by revising curriculum \nspecifications and making other policy improvements. Currently, textbooks are still in need of \nimproved professional skills in writing, illustration, page design, layout, and presentation to \nmake them more user friendly and thus enhance student interest and learning impact.  \n \n10.  While textbooks will remain for many years the fundamental learning and teaching tool, \nmodern, open access school libraries can play a key role as resource centers in supporting a \nmodern curriculum and student-centered learning. As such, they provide a wider range of \nalternative  materials,  viewpoints,  and  approaches  that  supplement  and  extend  the  basic \ntextbooks. They also create an environment in which students can take greater responsibility for \ntheir own learning through individual and small group research, discovery, and project work on \nthemes from the subjects that they study in class. This support is integral to competency-based \n    ", "  Appendix 3  31 \nlearning objectives and the development of higher order thinking skills. Unfortunately, school \nlibraries in Uzbekistan do not meet these requirements. They need to improve management, \nprovide adequate space, up-to-date and relevant stock, and the most basic equipment to aid \nlearning  and  teaching.  A  reformed  curriculum  and  classroom  learning  and  teaching \nmethodologies will require the additional learning resources that only a good school library can \nprovide. The introduction of computers and other learning hardware will in turn highlight the \nurgent need for educational software currently lacking in the Uzbek language.  \n \n11.  Teacher Quality and Development. Teacher quality is a key determinant of educational \nquality. Unlike in some transition economies, teachers in Uzbekistan have enjoyed regular pay \n(increases) and a range of services subsidized by the Government. Teacher education, both \npreservice and in-service, is also being reformed in content and organization. However, teacher \nquality remains a serious problem. About 50% of teachers at the primary level are considered to \nbe underqualified (without higher education), and many are overspecialized in narrow subject \nareas.  Virtually  all  teachers  will  need  to  be  retrained  to  meet  new  learning  and  teaching \nrequirements  as  changes  in  education  content;  methodology,  and  approach  are  being \nintroduced. While these improvements are urgently needed, poor salaries relative to other \nprofessions in a transitional labor market and lack of clear career development opportunities \noffer  little  incentive  or  motivation  for  teachers  to  improve  (e.g.,  in-service  training  facilities \noperate at only 60% capacity, reflecting a lack of interest in participating in training). Many \nyounger teachers have already abandoned teaching as a career, and, as a result, ageing is \nthreatening  the  sustainability  of  the  subsector.  The  Government  has  recently  announced \nsignificant increases in teachers\u2019 salaries and introduced a performance-based bonus system, \nand strengthened qualification requirements for teachers, and made in-service training a priority, \nincluding introducing new delivery modes such as distance education. However, insufficient \nduration  of  training,  inadequate  qualification  of  training  instructors,  lack  of  educational \nequipment and instructional resources, and other teacher support systems are critical issues to \nbe addressed if the quality and relevance of in-service teacher training us to be substantially \nimproved.  \n \n12.  Physical Infrastructure and Equipment. Like many other sectors, basic education also \nsuffers from insufficient investment in infrastructure, equipment, and facilities. As a result, the \nphysical infrastructure in many schools, especially, in poorer regions, suffers from dilapidated \nbuildings and classrooms and run-down lavatories; and poor water supply, electricity, heating, \nlaboratories, and school libraries. A recent nationwide survey revealed that 40% of schools are \nhoused  in  inappropriate  and  unfit  buildings.  Similarly,  lack  of  funding  has  led  to  lack  of \nmaintenance of all school facilities and equipment, and a serious underfunding of consumable \nsupplies in support of physics and chemistry labs. This is a serious constraint on practical and \nexperimental work, affecting effective learning and teaching. The short supply of necessary \noffice equipment such as computers and photocopiers impedes the effectiveness of school \nmanagement. Recently the Government launched a major multiyear initiative to refocus on \nimproving basic education; the principle component is improving the technical and material \nbasis of schools.  \n  \n13.  Progress toward the Millennium Development Goals. Two Millennium Development \nGoals contain an education focus. Goal 2: Achieving universal primary education means that all \nchildren should be able to complete a full course of primary education. Goal 3: Promote gender \nequality  and  empower  women  requires  the  elimination  of  gender  disparity  in  primary  and \nsecondary education by 2005 and from all levels of education no later than 2015.  \n ", "32  Appendix 3 \n14.  While net enrolment has peaked to over 99% after rebounding from declining during \nmost of the 1990s as a shock from transition, some evidence suggests1 that the attendance rate \nis far lower. However there are no recent meaningful indicators of completion rates to the 5th \ngrade. Lack of quality and relevance could be a contributing factor along with other economic \nand  social factors.  Keenly  aware  of  the detrimental  effect  on  the younger  generation,  the \nGovernment has ordered the State Prosecutor\u2019s Office for investigation and action. Although \nenrolment is balanced in terms of gender in basic education, greater gender disparity persists in \nsenior secondary education and higher education.  \n \n15.  Government Strategy and Policy Framework. Since independence, the Government \nhas given education high priority for the overall reform agenda. This is reflected in the close \nattention  paid  to  the  sector  by  senior  Government  officials  and  consistently  high  budget \nallocations to the sector. The strategic objective is to transform the education system to be more \nresponsive  to  the  requirements  of  a  market  economy  and  democratic  society  in  the  21st \ncentury. Earnest reform in education began in 1997 with the adoption of a new education law \nand the National Program for Personnel Training2. The national program identified principal \nareas of reform including improving basic education and the objectives and actions to achieve \nstated goals.3 Since then numerous presidential decrees and government resolutions have \nbeen issued to guide the implementation of the national program4. The emphasis was put on \nstrengthening senior secondary and vocational education during the early years of program \nimplementation. The public expenditure framework reflects the high priority accorded to the \nsector, and budget spending on education has remained high ranging between 7\u20138% of gross \ndomestic product or over 20% of the annual budget, reaching about 10% of gross domestic \nproduct or about 38% of the annual budget in 2003/04.  \n \n16.  During  the  initial  years  of  implementation,  new  state  education  standards  were \ndeveloped.  Many  reform  measures  have  been  undertaken  to  address  the  key  challenges \ndiscussed here. Significant progress has been made in basic education, including (i) markedly \nimproving efficiency and cost-effectiveness of textbook provision; (ii) continuing progress in \ncurriculum  reform;  (iii)  modernizing  and  decentralizing  the  management  system,  including \nauthorization for schools to raise and manage extrabudgetary resources and the establish \nschool  boards;  (iv)  implementing  resource  rationalization  measures  for  staff  and  other \nresources; and (v) providing budget support for the provision of textbooks and clothing to \nchildren from low income families.  \n \n17.  Recently a Presidential decree issued in February 2004 reaffirms the high priority status \nof basic education and redirects substantial resources for implementing the reform agenda. \nWithin  basic  education,  priorities  include  (i)  strengthening  the  infrastructure  of  schools, \nespecially rural schools, for basic education; (ii) increasing the supply of textbooks and other \ninstructional materials as well as computers and modern lab equipment; (iii) redesigning and \nimproving education content via revision of the present state education standards, curriculum, \nand syllabi; (iv) strengthening teacher quality especially in rural areas by improving incentives \nand in-service training; and (v) encouraging private investment in basic education. Subsequent \nto the decree, the comprehensive National Program for School Education Development 2004\u2013\n                                                 \n1  United Nations Children\u2019s Fund database. \n2  The Constitution of Uzbekistan guarantees free basic education to all citizens.  \n3  These areas include (i) improvement of preschools and basic education, (ii) rationalization of senior secondary and \nvocational education, (iii) improvement of educational management and financing, and (iv) establishment of an \neffective personnel training system.  \n4  The three stages of implementation begin with the first stage from 1997\u20132001, second from 2002\u20132005, and third \nfrom 2006\u20132010. \n    ", "  Appendix 3  33 \n2009  was  unveiled.  The  program  envisages  substantial  increases  in  investment  in  basic \neducation and will guide the implementation of the reform agenda in basic education over the \nnext 5 years.  \n \n18.  Strategy  and  Assistance  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  Other \nDevelopment Agencies. ADB is the lead provider of financial assistance in basic education in \nUzbekistan. A key objective of ADB\u2019s country strategy is to assist the Government to reduce the \nsocial costs of transition in which a key focus is on the education sector. ADB\u2019s sector strategy \nin  education  is  two-pronged:  supporting  efforts  to  improve  the  quality  and  relevance  of \neducation and enhancing national capacity to manage sector reforms. Following this approach, \nADB\u2019s  policy  dialogue  and  assistance  in  basic  education  have  focused  on  supporting  the \nGovernment in addressing fundamental issues such as reforming the curriculum improving the \navailability  and  affordability  of  textbooks  and  learning  materials  production,  strengthening \nteacher quality and development, promoting private sector participation, as well as enhancing \nplanning and management capacities in all levels of basic education. Since 1998 ADB has \nprovided five loans for basic education to help the Government implement reforms in these \nareas.  \n \n19.  While the Basic Education Textbook Development Project has laid the foundation for the \nProject, the Education Sector Development Project also provides important support, particularly \nwith respect to its objectives to (i) strengthen sector planning and management capacities, (ii) \nimprove and extend teacher education, and (iii) initiate pro-poor policy reform and strengthen \ncommunity involvement. These features of Education Sector Development Project, once fully \nimplemented, will support the Project by providing (i) a strong and coherent policy framework,  \n(ii) stronger sector institution capacity for successful implementation, (iii) enhanced teacher \nquality  complementary  to  improved  textbooks,  and  (iv)  strengthened  decision-making  at \nschools.  \n \n20.  ADB  has  maintained  close  coordination  with  other  funding  agencies  to  strengthen \ndevelopment impact through complementary actions (Appendix 4). The United States Agency \nfor International Development has two pilot projects (totaling $5 million) for improving teacher \nquality, teaching, equipment including computers, and community involvement; and strengthen \nschool management. United Nations agencies such as the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund are \nalso piloting similar support to a number of schools. These projects, while limited in scope and \ngeographic coverage, complement ADB\u2019s assistance in testing out innovative approaches and \nmethods to improve quality and relevance of basic education. Recently, development agencies \nhave enhanced coordination in supporting further reforms in basic education. \n ", "         \n \n3  \n4\n \n \n \nFigure A3.1: Issues in Basic Education \u2014 A Problem Tree Analysis   \nA\n  pp\ne\n  Need for Enhancement of the Quality of  n\nd\n    Effect Basic Education   ix\n         Core pro blem           3\n \nInefficient and Non-sustainable Textbook \n  Provision\nCauses \n \n \n \nGovernance,  Curriculum and  Learning and Teaching  Teacher Quality  Physical Infrastructure & \n         \nInstitutional Capacity  Other Quality Related  Materials  and Development Equipment \n \nPolicies \n       \n  - Highly centralized  - Overloaded  - Need to modernize  - Need for retraining  -Decayed infrastructure \n  bureaucratic system  curriculum with too  content and methodology   (overspecialization,  (classrooms, buildings, \n  - Weak planning and  many subjects and too  - High cost/poor  methodologies)  heating, sanitary facilities) \n  management capacity  many content  affordability  - Lack of motivation  -Lack of education facilities \nat all levels  requirements  - Poor pedagogical  and career  such as libraries, \n \n- Need to improve  - Inappropriate  presentation and physical  development   laboratories, sports facilities\n  budgeting and  assessment and  quality  - Ageing work force  - Lack of other equipment \n  inefficient use of  testing system  - Lack of supplementing  (transition labor  and consumable supplies \n  existing resources  - Need to review  materials (library stocks)  market influence)  (for chemistry, physics, labs\n  -  Need  to  improve language of instruction  - Lack of sustainable  - Teacher training  management equipment, \ntargeted support of the practice  information and  system and facilities  etc.) \n \npoorest    communication technology  need updating  - Ineffective use of existing \n  - Lack of competition  (ICT) development to    infrastructure \n  and private sector  modernize learning \n  pBaarstiicc ipEadtuiocnation  BETDP: syllabus  BETDP: research \nBETDP: textbook supply,  BETDP: printing equipment \n  Textbook Development  development in six  quality upgrading, and  into methodologies  and raw materials \nProject (BETDP): book  subjects  ESDP: In-service \n  affordability  ESDP; upgrading poor \ntrade and the private  Education Sector  and DE teacher \n  ESDP: teacher training and  schools with furniture and \nsector   Development Project  training and \nmethodological change  equipment, including ICT \n  ESDP: planning,  (ESDP): teacher  enhanced teacher \nthe Project; Sustainable  the Project: upgrading \n  budgeting,  training curriculum  efficiency \ntextbook supply, quality  1,000 school libraries with \n  management capacity,  the Project:  improvement, school  the Project:  furniture, stock and \nand pro-poor activity  comprehensive  curriculum impact on \n  libraries & ICT policy  equipment, including ICT \nthe Project: private  curriculum and  methodology and \n  sector access, local  assessment reform  teacher training for \n  training capacity, and  plus Language of  libraries \n  targeted subsidies to  Instruction study \n  the poor \n \nBETDP = Basic Education Textbook Development Project, ESDP = Education Sector Development Project,  ICT = information and  \ncommunication technology. \n ", "  Appendix 4  35\nEXPERIENCE OF THE TEXTBOOK RENTAL SCHEME IN UZBEKISTAN \n \nA.  The Pilot Textbook Rental Scheme \n1.  Until 1998 all school textbooks were supplied free of charge to students on the basis of \nannual  loans  from  the  school  textbook  library.  The  Government  funded  all  textbooks.  As \nfinancial  constraints  became  more  intense  the  Government  abandoned  this  policy  and \nintroduced parental purchase of textbooks. While many parents found textbooks at full price \nunaffordable, suppliers also struggled with uncertainty of demand and lack of credit. By 2000 a \nserious textbook shortage existed in many schools and the (MOPE) requested a research study \ninto  alternative  approaches  to  textbook  provision  under  the  Basic  Education  Textbook \nDevelopment Project. The research study made the following recommendations, which were \naccepted and implemented by MOPE as the pilot Textbook Rental Scheme (TRS): \n \n(i)  Design a TRS to suit the specific requirements of Uzbekistan and pilot test it to \ndetermine its efficacy and acceptability in Uzbekistan. \n(ii)  Maintain parental rental fee contributions within school bank accounts to create a \nschool-based rental scheme. \n(iii)  Develop an evaluation scheme acceptable to the Government, MOPE, and the \nAsian Development Bank as the basis for  \u2018\u2018go/no go\u201d decisions on extending the \npilot to national coverage \n \n2.  The  pilot  TRS  was  planned  in  February  2001  and  launched  in  April  2001  prior  to \nsupplying  rental  scheme  books  to  schools  in  September  2001.  It  supplied  1.583  million \ntextbooks in the Uzbek language (plus accompanying teacher guides) of 39 different titles \ncovering 6 grade levels to over 220,000 students (4% of total enrolment) in 14 raions\u2014one \nraion from each oblast in Uzbekistan, including the poorest raions. \n \n3.  Between September 2001, when the pilot TRS was launched, and May 2002 when the \nrental fee collection period closed, the pilot TRS collected over SUM319 million from parents \ninto  the  Textbook  Revolving  Fund  account  maintained  in  the  Pakhta  Bank.  This  sum \nrepresented a collection rate of 93% of the target figure. This clearly demonstrated the success \nof the pilot TRS and the evaluation study concluded as follows: \n \n(i)  Parents strongly supported the TRS concept and were prepared to meet the \nannual cost of the rental fee, including those from the poorest schools.  \n(ii)  Parents were motivated to pay the rental fees because they were much cheaper \nthan  the  costs  of  textbook  purchase  and  because  the  fees  collected  and \naccumulated in school accounts were perceived to be of direct benefit to their \nown local community schools \n(iii)  The poorest students required ongoing financial support for the textbook rental \nfees. The study suggested that government funding for 10\u201315% of the poorest \nstudents should be sufficient to ensure full and sustainable textbook supply. \n(iv)  Four years of government/funding agency investment in start-up textbook rental \nstock was needed. Thereafter, school textbook provision could cease to be a \ncharge on government budgets (except for continued Government support for the \nvery  poorest  families  (iii)  and  could  be  maintained  by  parental  contributions \nalone.  \n(v)  Devolved expenditure on textbooks to the level of individual schools supported \ngeneral educational objectives in Uzbekistan on moves toward decentralization \nvia school-based, per capita funding and school-based management.  \n   \n ", "36 Appendix 4 \n(vi)  Full textbook provision for every student in every core subject at every grade \nlevel supported by parental contributions was realistic and achievable as long as \nrental fees were held at affordable levels. \n \n4.  As a result of the success of the pilot TRS, the Cabinet of Ministers approved the \nextension of the TRS concept to the national level from September 2002. \n \nB.  Extension of the Textbook Rental Scheme (TRS) to National Coverage \n5.  The first national phase of the TRS was launched in September 2002. It comprised 10 \ntitles for grade 9, all of which had been selected from competitive submissions generated by an \ninternationally announced textbook competition\u2014the first time such a process had been used in \nUzbekistan. Textbooks were supplied in both Uzbek and Karakalpak. The second cycle for \nschool  year  2003/04  supplied  textbooks  for  grades  4  and  5  in  three  languages\u2014Uzbek, \nKarakalpak, and Russian. The third cycle for school year 2004/05 will provide grades 2 and 3 \ntextbooks and teacher guides in all seven national languages. A summary of the details of the \nnational operation of the TRS is provided in Table A4. \n \n6.  To achieve sustainability, the TRS should operate on collection rates of around 90% of \ntotal enrolment (excluding 15% of the poorest who can\u2019t pay). However, collection rates for the \nTRS have declined since the pilot project. The reasons for this include the following:. \n \n(i)  In 2002/03 only 72% of the schools were initially supplied with TRS textbooks as \na result of a shortfall in Government funding. This caused confusion among many \nschools, which often did not know whether they were part of the TRS. \n(ii)  In 2003/04 many of the textbooks were not supplied to schools until January \n2004.  Thus  rental  fee collection  is  still  in  progress  and additional sums  are \nexpected to be paid into the bank accounts in the next 2 months. \n(iii)  The  Basic  Education  Textbook  Development  Project  is  currently  nearing \ncompletion and maintaining the necessary monitoring and supervision of raions \nand schools is difficult. \n(iv)  A recent school mapping exercise suggests that enrollment numbers may have \nbeen overstated in the past by up to 10%.  \n \n7.  Most  of  the  reasons  identified  were  due  to  a  lack  of  experience,  planning,  and \ncoordination,  and  are  thus  avoidable  in  the  future.  However,  a  key  factor  in  maintaining \ncollection  rates  is  the  necessity  for  systematic  monitoring  and  supervision.  International \nexperience demonstrates that all TRSs suffer from fluctuations in collection rates. Therefore \nfinancial systems should be able to provide fast and accurate information on levels of collection \nto enable problems to be quickly identified and rectified. This is the case in Uzbekistan where \ncollection levels are monitored nationally on a monthly basis. The national data can then be \nanalyzed in more detail for individual oblasts, raions, and even schools. This is the basis for \nstrong and effective management and the fast resolution of problems.1 If the Uzbek TRS is to be \nsustainable it must be able to take  corrective  action in  response to  occasional shortfalls. The \nmonitoring of oblasts, raions, and schools should be intensified to maintain collection rates and\n                                                 \n1  One of the main problems in the TRSs in Tajikistan and Kazakhstan was the lack of reliable financial information \non collections. Conversely, the success of the Armenian scheme was strongly based on the detailed and accurate \nfinancial information available to scheme management.   \n    ", "  Appendix 4  37\nthe  value  of  the  fund.2  The  establishment  of  the  Republican  Textbook  Revolving  Fund \nFoundation early in 2005 will provide, for the first time, dedicated TRS monitoring staff in each \noblast and part-time TRS monitoring staff in every raion in addition to the strong financial \nsystems described earlier. Collection should be maintained at the required levels. \n \n8.  This is the foundation on which the proposed successor project will build to complete the \nconstruction  of  a  fully  operational  and  sustainable  textbook  provision  system  providing  all \nrequired textbooks in all subjects and all grades to all students in all national languages. \n \nTable A4: Textbook Rental Scheme Operations in Uzbekistan \nItem  2002/03  2003/04  2004/05 \nGrade(s) Supplied  9  4 and 5  2 and 3 \nNumber of Titles/Grades  10  Grade 4 =5 titles  Grade 2 =5 titles \nGrade 5 = 6 titles  Grade 3 = 5 titles \nNumber of Languages  2  3  7 \nPrint Runs (all languages)  568,000  603,000  520,000 \nRental Fees  SUM3,250   Grade 4 = SUM1,650  Not yet calculated \nGrade 5 = SUM1,800  \nTarget Collection Level  SUM1.923 billion   SUM3.920 billion    \nOpening TRS Balance  SUM0.311 billion   SUM1.980 billion   4.750 billion \nClosing TRS Balance  SUM1.980 billion   SUM4.765 billion    \nInterest Earned (estimate)  Not yet paid into  Not yet paid into   \naccount  account \nValue of Collections  SUM1.660 billion   SUM2.785 billion    \nCollection Rate  86%  71%   \nProcurement Cost  SUM4.5 billion   SUM4.6 billion   3.2 billion \n \nNotes: \na. Grade 9 titles included English but not French or German. Thus 350,000 students were supplied with 10 titles at a \nrental fee of SUM3,250 and 218,000 students (those studying French or German or without an English teacher) \nwere supplied with 9 titles at a rental fee of SUM2,950. \nb. Grade 4 Russian students were supplied with only three titles at a rental fee of SUM1,200.  \nc. Grade 5 Russian students were supplied with only five titles at a rental fee of SUM1,500. \nd. The target collection level is cumulative and includes repeat fees from the previous years\u2019 supplies. \ne. Interest earned is still being calculated by Pakhta Bank and has not yet been credited to the TRS accounts. It is \nestimated to be approximately SUM470 million and part is currently held in a suspense account awaiting allocation \nto individual school accounts. When transferred, the value of the fund will be over SUM5.25 billion. If collection \nrates for the third cycle supply can be restored to target levels, then the value of the fund will exceed SUM10 billion \nby the end of the year, which is sufficient to maintain sustainability. \nf. The significant reduction in student enrolments in grades 2 and 3 for school year 2004/05 is not believed to be an \nactual reduction in student numbers but the result of more accurate data supplied following the recent school \nmapping exercise. The student numbers may have been overestimated by as much as 10% in previous TRS \nsupply cycles, which partly explains the declining TRS fee collection rates. \ng. It should be noted that no financial support for socially unprotected students is included in the TRS to date. This \nwill be included for the first time in the 4th TRS cycle, which will supply books to schools in September 2005. \nSource:  Asian Development Bank estimates.\n2  It should be noted that Uzbekistan has provided seed funding for textbook supplies to schools over a 4-year\nperiod to allow time for TRS funds to accumulate. In practice, this means that there is a 4-year funding cushion\nwithin the Uzbek TRS, which provides time for corrective action to be taken in response to any occasional\nshortfall, Thus, by the end of 2004, the Uzbek TRS fund is projected to have accumulated to around SUM10\nbillion with 2 full years of collection still to take place before renewals are required. The projected cost of the first\nyear of replacement is around SUM5 billion. Thus the TRS has already reached initial sustainability. \n   \n ", "        \n \n3\n8\n \n \n \n \n \nA\np\nDEVELOPMENT COORDINATION MATRIX  p\ne\nSector/  n\nd\nThematic  Asian Development Bank Strategy/Activities  Other Development Partners\u2019 Strategy/Activities  ix\n 5\n/Area   \nEducation  Support efforts to improve the relevance and quality  EU-TACIS: Assistance to the ministries of higher and public education in the \nof education and enhance national capacities to plan,  Restructuring of Education System covers: education planning, financing \ndesign, manage, and monitor sector reforms.  and management systems; interministry coordination regarding policies and \n  horizontal issues (1998\u20132000); Assistance to the Reform of Vocational \nTarget primarily compulsory education (grades 1\u2013 Education\u2014strategic recommendations for vocational and technical \n12), along with support for early childhood  education; development of new curricula for six professional profiles; skill \ndevelopment).

The textbook rental scheme (TRS) was piloted successfully in 2001 under the Basic \nEducation Textbook Development Project to address the provision of affordable textbooks after \nthe Government decided to stop supplying free textbooks starting in 1998. Under the TRS \nparents rent textbooks at a fee only a fraction of the full purchase price; textbooks are designed \nto last 4 years. Starting from 2002, the TRS is being gradually extended nationwide until 2007 \nwhen all grades (2\u20139) in all schools will be covered by the TRS. The extension of TRS coverage \nto grades 6, 7, and 8 will be supported by the Project during 2005\u20132007. The rental fees \ncollected are kept in a Ministry of Public Education (MOPE) account with each school having a \nsubaccount identifying its portion of the fees collected. As of 1 July 2004, a total of SUM4.7 \nbillion (or 47% of the total costs of TRS introduced during 2001\u20132003) had been accumulated. \nThis amount is expected to increase steadily until the first cycle of textbook replacement (for \ngrade 9) begins in 2006 when there will be a drawdown on the collected amount. At full national \ncoverage the average balance of the rental fees collected is projected to be about $30 million, \nand no further budgetary support will be required except for the continued support, which the \nGovernment has committed to, for the socially unprotected. This amounts to about 15% of total \nenrolment who cannot afford to pay even the rental fees. The main sources of TRS financing \nare the Government (budget and Asian Development Bank (ADB) loans) and parents who pay \nrental fees. While the Government provides the startup capital, once replacement of textbooks \nbegins, starting in 2006, no further budgetary support will be needed except for the socially \nunprotected.  \n \n2.  Based on the experience in Uzbekistan since 2001 and lessons learned elsewhere, a \nnumber  of  key  principles  have  been  identified  for  TRS  sustainability  and  the  provision  of \naffordable textbooks to all students nationwide. First, rental fee collection rates have to be \nsufficiently high (80% or more), which requires widespread support of parents. A key to win and \nmaintain parental support is the guarantee that the rental fees will be used for the purpose for \nwhich they are intended, the sustainable supply of low-cost textbooks. Second, high collection \nrates depend critically on overall supervision and management. Experience elsewhere (e.g., \nArmenia, Tajikistan) has highlighted the importance of systematic supervision and monitoring. \nThird, continued government support will be required for supporting those students (about 15% \nbased on Uzbekistan experience) who are too poor to pay even rental fees\u2014to ensure equity \nand social protection. Fourth, affordable rental fees require long book life to allow for maximum \ncost  amortization,  which  in  turn  is  based  on  high  physical  production  specifications.  The \ncollected rental fees will have to be maintained intact and without misappropriation or diversion \ninto other uses. In education systems where financial resources are scarce there will always be \npressure to divert accumulated rental fees to other urgent needs unless they are specifically \nprotected. Diversion of funding undermines the TRS\u2019 capacity to purchase replacement copies \nin the required quantities, which in turn undermines the entire TRS concept. Finally, centralized \nversus school-based management of TRS fees will have distinct advantages in terms of the \ncapacity  to  maintain  the  fund  value  through  financial  and  risk  management,  and  internal \nsystematic monitoring and control.  \n \n3.  The Government, assisted by ADB, has been considering various options based on \nthese principles in order to institutionalize the sustainable provision of textbooks. Consultations \nhave been held with all stakeholders over the past 2 years, including seminars, workshops, \ninterviews, field visits, and a nationwide public campaign on the TRS. ADB missions have \nworked closely with the Government and local legal experts on the issue since 2004. As a \nresult, agreement has been reached on the establishment of a republican textbook revolving \nfund foundation (RTRFF) as an independent legal entity. Its main objective is to manage the \n ", "40   Appendix 6 \nrental fees accumulated under the TRS and textbook procurement and distribution on orders \nplaced by schools and parents. In achieving its main objective, the RTRFF will be required to \nfulfill the following: \n \n(i)  Consolidate parent and school support for the TRS and represent their interests. \n(ii)  Ensure that the textbook funds are operated within the Government\u2019s education \npolicy guidelines. \n(iii)  Guarantee the security and proper use of the rental fees collected from parents. \n(iv)  Ensure the most effective use of scarce resources and minimize the costs of \ntextbook production. \n(v)  Provide professional management of the rental fees collected.  \n(vi)  Coordinate textbook development policies and practices with MOPE. \n(vii)  Provide  independent  monitoring,  data  collection  and  accurate  order \nestablishment from schools. \n(viii)  Organize efficient and on-time procurement and delivery of textbooks to schools \naccording to school orders. \n \n4.  The RTRFF will be governed by  a board of trustees comprising representatives of \nschools, parents, the Mahalla (local community), as well as the government. The board will \nappoint RTRFF management. As a foundation, its charter will specify in more detail its scope of \nactivities,  responsibilities,  and  obligations  in  accordance  with  Uzbek  law.  However, \ntransparency, accountability, and financial prudence are its principles of operation. A small \npercentage of the interest on the accumulated rental fees can be made available to pay the \noperating costs of the RTRFF; to maintain a permanent, specialist staff to manage the rental \nfees on behalf of parents and schools; and to ensure sustainability of textbook provision. A \nmaximum limit on the use of funds for administration purposes can be established as part of the \nRTRFF charter. A draft charter has been discussed with the Government and is undergoing \nrevision. \n \n5.  Given  the  key  importance  of  the  RTRFF  to  the  sustainable  provision  of  affordable \ntextbooks (a key objective of the Project), the Government and ADB have agreed on a series of \ntime-bound actions. These include: the Government will (i) issue a resolution or similar legally \nbinding document by December 2004 to establish the RTRFF; (ii) register the RTRFF charter \nwith the Ministry of Justice with consultation and agreement by ADB prior to its registration; and \n(iii) ensure that the RTRFF will be fully operational by February 2005. The timely fulfillment of \nthe actions, as a condition for disbursement for textbook procurement, will ensure that support \nfor textbook provision under the Project will meet its designed purposes.  \n \n    ", "  Appendix 7  41 \nOUTLINE OF SELECTION CRITERIA FOR WORKING GROUPS  \nAND SCHOOL LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT \n \n1.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Uzbekistan: \n \nAlthough  Uzbekistan  has  achieved  virtual  universal  primary  completion  and  gender  equity  in  basic \neducation,  the  Project  will  contribute  to  the  achievement  of  Millennium  Development  Goal  targets, \nparticularly in improving all aspects of the quality of basic education and ensuring that children belonging \nto ethnic minorities have access to compulsory basic education of good quality. The Project contributes to \nthe accumulation of human capital, which is essential for higher incomes and sustained economic growth. \nIt helps reduce poverty by increasing the productivity of the poor and by equipping people with the skills \nthey need to participate fully in the economy and in society.  \n \nWithin the context of basic education reforms, the Project will enhance the curriculum by making it more \nrelevant to the needs of the labor market, will improve access by making textbooks more affordable for the \npoorest parents, and will broaden community participation by decentralizing education management and \nfinancing. Improving the quality and relevance of the basic education system will be key priorities for \nreducing poverty and preventing the intergenerational transmission of poverty.   \n \nThe survey report indicated that the Project will benefit 6 million students in grades 2 to 9 in which 27% are \nstudents from poor families. Four hundred thousand students from minority language schools will receive \nnew and better quality textbooks and supplementary reading materials. Secondary beneficiaries include \n160,000 teachers and about 1,200 school librarians who will receive new teacher guides and in-service \ntraining. In addition, 40 curriculum developers and assessment specialists, 270 textbook evaluators, and a \nnew generation of textbook authors and publishers plus the Uzbek printing industry will benefit from \ntraining in modern techniques in their respective professional areas. The provision of basic information and \ncommunication technology (ICT) capacity in 1,000 school libraries will support an increase in the volume \nand quality of information exchange, and will develop policies for future ICT investments in the sector. \n \nThe Government will continue to earmark budget support for subsidizing textbook rental fees for about \n15% of the students that began in 2002/03. Provision of computers and supplementary books and \nmaterials for use in upgraded school libraries will improve the learning environment in schools, which will \nlead to higher achievements of pupils. About 40% of the investment in upgraded school libraries will be \ntargeted to the poorest schools in the country. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis     Poverty Classification \n \n   \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?   Poverty  Intervention  (Following  the \n  Board approval of the R-paper, Review \nof ADB\u2019s Poverty Reduction Strategy, \nUzbekistan has a population of about 25 million and the World Bank \nstaff instructions to replace the PI/CPI \nreport on Uzbekistan Living Standards Assessment (2003) shows \nclassification  with  a  new  tracking \nthat an estimated 27.5% of the population or 6.8 million people are \nsystem are under preparation, in line \nunable to meet basic consumption needs or live below the poverty \nwith para. 83 of the R-paper.) \nline.

Joint international financial institutions\u2019 paper on Growth and Debt.  \n ", "58    Appendix 15 \nApproximately one third of all poor households can be classified as \nextremely poor (footnote 1). Incidence of poverty is much higher in \nrural areas than their urban counterparts. They are 35% more likely \nto be poor and 58% more likely to be extremely poor. The higher \nincidence of rural poverty is compounded by rural-urban income \ndifferentials.  The  observed  rural-urban  differentials  in  poverty \nincidence can be attributed to a variety of factors, most important \namong which are educational attainments, lack of infrastructures, \ndifferences in opportunities such as access to markets or labor \nmarket opportunities, and environmental factors that affect health or \nland quality.2  \n \nIn general, the transition has resulted in a significant fall in living \nstandards for most of the population. The transition period has been \naccompanied by (i) increase in unemployment, (ii) high inflation, (iii) \na  decline  in  production,  (iv)  decreasing  standards  of  living,  (v) \nincreasing income differentiation and inequality, and (vi) decreasing \nbudgets for social services, such as education. Physical indicators \nof poverty such as malnutrition have steadily worsened, and the \nsocial safety net has deteriorated mainly because of the limited \nresources available for poverty reduction. Although Government \nexpenditures on education have remained relatively high, the falling \nliving standards and the introduction of cost sharing for all students \nhave  made  education  more  expensive  especially  for  the  poor. \nHigher education has now become unaffordable to many students. \n \n \nB.  Participation Process \n \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nThe Project was designed through the participation of all stakeholder groups such as central and sectoral \nministries, oblast and raion education departments, Hakimyats (local executive branch of the government), \nschool directors, teachers, and parents as the main beneficiaries. In addition to conventional survey \nmethods the participatory rural appraisal was employed to provide a voice to communities, particularly to \nthe poor. A major national publicity campaign using national and regional television, radio, the press, the \nbanking  system,  and  information  circulars  to  educational  establishments  ensured  that  parents  and \nteachers  fully  understood  the  financial  and  economic  benefits  and  the  operational  principles  of  the \nTextbook Rental Scheme (TRS). Parents of poor families have particularly welcomed the significant \nreductions in annual textbook costs and the possibility of full participation in the management of the \naccumulated rental funds.  \n \nThe  Project  will  continue  national  publicity  campaigns  for  the  extension  of  the  TRS.  Extensive \nconsultations will be conducted to develop a model for minority language educational programs, including \nan assessment of the special needs of ethnic minority children, current actual provision, and current actual \nachievement. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n2   Detailed analysis on poverty, labor market and education is presented Supplementary Appendix F. \n    ", "  Appendix 15  59\nD.

Approval \ncriteria and methodology are being included in the specific evaluation requirements on the fair and \nequitable presentation of gender in textbooks, teacher guides, and other learning materials and marks. \nThe evaluation for gender sensitivity and appropriateness is part of the process of approval. Training \nworkshops  conducted  under  BETDP  for  textbook  authors  and  publishers  on  the  issue  of  gender \nstereotyping will be continued as part of the Project. The project performance monitoring system will \ninclude enrollment, retention, and general gender and development concerns.
