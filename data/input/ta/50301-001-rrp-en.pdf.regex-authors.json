I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the \nSecond Integrated Road Investment Program. \n \n2.  The investment program will improve the accessibility of the road network in Sri Lanka\u2019s \nrural areas, and thereby increase the involvement of the rural population in nationwide economic \nand social development. It will upgrade and maintain about 3,400 kilometers (km) of rural access \nroads to an all-weather standard; rehabilitate and maintain to a good condition about 340 km of \nnational roads in Eastern, Northern, Uva, and Western provinces; and improve the capacity of \nroad agencies with respect to safeguards, road safety, maintenance, research capacity, and road \ndesign and construction.1 \n \nII.  THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Sri Lanka\u2019s economy has grown at an annual average of 6% since 2003. With strong \neconomic growth, the poverty rate dropped significantly, from 22.7% in 2002 to 6.7% in 2012\u2013\n2013.2 About 82% of Sri Lanka\u2019s population (21 million in 2015) lives in rural areas.3 The rural \nsector also recorded a remarkable reduction in poverty, from 24.7% in 2002 to 7.6% in 2012\u2013\n2013. \n \n4.  Despite rapid progress in reducing poverty, Sri Lanka faces several challenges to fully \neradicate poverty. Disparities in the poverty rate exist across provinces and districts, particularly \nin districts in Eastern, Northern, and Uva provinces, where headcount poverty rates are close to, \nor exceed, 20%. The Western Province, which has Sri Lanka\u2019s lowest headcount poverty rate, \nstill retains pockets of poverty\u201436% of the population remains vulnerable and lives close to the \npoverty line (on less than $4 per day). Consumption and income inequality have both increased \nsince 2009, with slower consumption and income growth among the poorer half of the population \nthan among the wealthier half.4 Pro-poor economic growth will need to be driven not only by high \nrates of public expenditure, but also by market-oriented value addition and private sector-led \ninvestment.  Access  to  markets,  and  business  and  knowledge  opportunities  and  benefits, \nespecially along agricultural value chains, will be key to further poverty reduction and shared \nprosperity in rural areas. However, these have been hindered by poor transport infrastructure, \nparticularly poorly maintained provincial and local authority roads. \n \n5.  Sustainable and inclusive development remains a key concept as the government seeks \nto secure prosperity for everyone. The government\u2019s development policy statements identified \nfive development goals: (i) generate 1 million jobs, (ii) enhance income levels, (iii) develop rural \neconomies, (iv) ensure land ownership in rural and estate sectors, and (v) create and grow a \n                                                \n1  The Road Development Authority (RDA) prepared the proposed investment program with assistance from the \nconsultants recruited for the Integrated Road Investment Program.

", "2 \nstrong middle class.5 To develop rural economies, the government plans to establish 2,500 rural \ndevelopment centers as rural economic market hubs. This will be achieved by grouping many \nvillages as potential development centers with access to fully equipped rural economic market \nunits, and by upgrading or rehabilitating rural access routes.6 \n \n6.  Road map. Sri Lanka\u2019s road network is dense and well laid out, providing basic access to \nthe country\u2019s population and economic activity centers. The 117,012-km road network is classified \ninto national, provincial, and local authority roads, based on administrative responsibility.7 The \ncentral government is responsible for transport policy. \n \n7.  Notable  progress  has  been  made  since  2005  in  addressing  trunk  road  network \ndeficiencies,8 but progress in improving provincial and rural roads has been relatively slow.9 \nImprovement of the poor rural transport infrastructure is key to achieving the government\u2019s \ndevelopment goals. Improving connectivity is challenging because most rural access roads, \nincluding provincial and local roads, cannot provide all-weather, user-friendly access, and parts \nof the trunk road network are in poor condition. These issues stem from (i) competition for budget \nallocations; (ii) limited availability of suitable raw materials; (iii) the limited project implementation \ncapacity of road agencies, particularly at provincial and local levels; (iv) ad hoc selection of \nprovincial  and  local  project  roads  that  lacks  clear  criteria;  and  (v)  insufficient  community \ninvolvement in rural road development. \n \n8.  Preserving the asset value of rehabilitated infrastructure, particularly road infrastructure \nmanaged by the provinces and local authorities, is also challenging.10 Several factors must be \naddressed to ensure sustainability of rural road assets, including (i) inadequate rural road design \nstandards and construction specifications; (ii) poor provincial and local-level contractor capacity; \n(iii) limited technical maintenance and road asset management capacity on the part of provincial \nand local-level road agencies; (iv) lack of capital investment coupled with sound maintenance \nregimes; and (v) insufficient maintenance budget allocations to rural roads. \n \n9.  Policy framework. The government has adopted a two-tier strategy to provide nationwide \nconnectivity: (i) establish a trunk road network with expressways and well-connected national \nroads linked to the global value chain, and (ii) complete a rural road network to connect the rural \npopulation to trunk roads for poverty reduction and shared prosperity. The Public Investment \nProgramme, 2017\u20132020, provides policy directions for the road sector to facilitate the country\u2019s \neconomic growth by creating an efficient road network that (i) connects large and emerging cities, \n                                                \n5  From the Prime Minister\u2019s economic statements to Parliament on 5 November 2015 and on 27 October 2016. \n6  The government is implementing a $1.8 billion rural road connectivity investment plan designed to provide physical \ninfrastructure and capacity to enhance rural road connectivity. The previous government originally selected about \n1,000 rural communities as rural hubs, based on their population and development potential. The current government \nrecently expanded the number of rural hubs to 2,500. \n7  The central government, through the Road Development Authority (RDA), manages 161 kilometers (km) of \nexpressways and 12,208 km of class A and class B roads classified as national roads. The provincial councils \nmanage the provincial road network, which comprises 19,083 km of class C and class D roads. Local authorities \nmanage the 85,560 km of local authority roads classified as class E. In addition, other government agencies (e.g., \nforest and irrigation departments) manage about 20,000 km of roads.  \n8  The proportion of national roads in good and fair condition rose from 48% in 2005 to 70% in 2015, and those in poor \ncondition declined from 52% to 30% during the same period. \n9  The government has established a rural road program, Maga Neguma, to improve rural roads through the RDA. \nSince 2004, the program has improved about 10,000 km of rural roads at the request of local authorities. In total, the \ngovernment has rehabilitated 4,900 km (26%) of provincial roads, and 39,000 km (37%) of rural roads.  \n10 About 80% of the rural access road network still requires rehabilitation. ", "3 \ntownships, economic centers, and rural hubs, and (ii) ensures safety and equity.11 \n \n10.  For  the  rural  road  network  enhancement  program  (footnote  6),  the  government \nestablished an implementation framework for the Road Development Authority (RDA) to improve \nprovincial and local authority roads with local road agencies. The objective was to accelerate \ncompletion of the rural road network by supplementing the limited capacity of the local agencies. \nTo  overcome  shortcomings  in  previous  rural  road  development  programs,  the  framework \nincreased subproject selection criteria accountability and strengthened community participation. \n \n11.  To manage the national road network, the RDA deployed a comprehensive road asset \nmanagement  system  in  its  planning  division  and  is  currently  enhancing  the  system,  with \nassistance from the World Bank, to improve internal management efficiency. Expansion of the \nroad asset management system to provincial and local authority roads is supported under the \nIntegrated Road Investment Program approved in 2014.12 A road maintenance trust fund was \nestablished in 2005, which through its operational budget provides sustainable funding for routine \nand periodic maintenance of the national road network. The maintenance budget increased from \nSLRs1.8 billion in 2005 to SLRs4.3 billion in 2015, following the establishment of the road \nmaintenance trust fund.13 The budget increase, together with the RDA\u2019s enhanced technical \nmaintenance capacity and the introduction of a road asset management system, has improved \nthe condition of national roads, but rural road sustainability still needs improvement.14 Initiatives \nwere undertaken in the first program to improve rural road sustainability through (i) improvement \nof  rural  road  design  and  specifications,  (ii)  introduction  of  a  3-year  performance-based \nmaintenance (PBM) contract, and (iii) technical capacity development of local road agencies. \n \n12.  Strategic context. In line with the government\u2019s national strategy, the country partnership \nstrategy, 2018\u20132022 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for Sri Lanka aims to address major \ndevelopment constraints by (i) strengthening the drivers of economic growth, and (ii) improving \nthe quality of growth.15 The transport sector is a key area for implementing the strategy, and ADB \nplaces high value on improving the accessibility of the road network to integrate rural communities \nwith socioeconomic centers. \n \n13.  Investment program. The proposed Second Integrated Road Investment Program aligns \nwith the government strategy and policy to establish fully connected rural development centers \nwith upgraded rural roads. The proposed investment program targets the three lagging provinces \nof Eastern, Northern, and Uva, and Western Province, and will complement assistance under the \nfirst program in other areas to cover all of the country\u2019s priority rural development hubs.16 The \nproposed investment program will play a catalytic role in the sustainable development of rural \nareas. \n                                                \n11 Government of Sri Lanka, Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs, Department of National Planning. 2017. \nPublic Investment Programme, 2017\u20132020.

Completion Report: Eastern and North Central Provincial Road Project \nin Sri Lanka. Manila). \n15 ADB. 2017. Country Partnership Strategy: Sri Lanka 2018\u20132022. Manila.  \n16 ADB approved the first program, with an MFF of $800 million, to upgrade the rural road network in the Central, North \nCentral, North Western, Sabaragamuwa, and Southern provinces, and in the Kalutara district in Western Province. \nThe proposed investment program will also cover the Kalutara district in Western Province (the project allocation to \nthe district under the first program was insufficient). \n ", "4 \n14.  An MFF is proposed for the financing modality for the investment program because it will \nallow long-term partnership between the government and ADB on policy dialogue and capacity \ndevelopment within the large-scale program. The MFF uses a time-slicing approach to increase \nthe  efficiency  of  financial  resource  utilization  during  program  implementation.17 Under  the \nproposed  MFF,  the  RDA  identified  the  projects,  all  of  which  have  a  low  safeguards  risk \nclassification (none are classified as category A). Subsequent MFF tranches will finance the \nidentified projects in accordance with disbursement requirements. \n \n15.  A portfolio review of ADB-funded road projects confirmed that Sri Lanka has adequate \nimplementation capacity. Review missions for the first program also observed that it is being \nimplemented  smoothly  with  no  critical  implementation  capacity  issues.18 RDA  awarded  all \ncontracts for rural roads under the first program. Physical progress of the civil works is about \n47.1% as of June 2017. Lessons from the review are incorporated in the design of the proposed \ninvestment program. Major improvements include (i) stronger community participation, (ii) more \nrational contract package, and (iii) modified contract conditions.19 \n \n16.  Development  coordination.  There  has  been  continuous  coordination  among \ndevelopment partners active in Sri Lanka\u2019s road sector since 2004, which include ADB, the Japan \nInternational  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA),  and  the  World  Bank.  JICA  has  assisted  in  the \nrehabilitation of national and provincial roads.20 The World Bank has supported the rehabilitation \nof national, provincial, and local authority roads, and institutional changes and reforms in road \nmaintenance management. In 2016, the World Bank approved the Transport Connectivity and \nAsset Management Project to support modern road asset management in the RDA.21  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n17.  The  impact  of  the  investment  program  will  be  improved  connectivity  between  rural \ncommunities  and  socioeconomic  centers  in  Sri  Lanka,  in  line  with  the  Public  Investment \nProgramme, 2017\u20132020. The outcome will be increased transport efficiency on project roads. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n18.  The outputs of the proposed investment program will be (i) improved road conditions \nbetween the selected rural communities and socioeconomic centers, and (ii) enhanced capacity \nof road agencies.22 \n                                                \n17 Comparison of Financing Modality and Approach to Time-Slice Financing (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n18 Summary Review of the First Investment Program (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  As \nfor the capacity development component, more than 60 workshops and training programs have been carried out on \nroad safety, community participation methodology, contract management, and safeguards. Technical specifications \nfor rural road construction and maintenance are also being updated. Support for the road asset management \ndevelopment will start within 2017.  \n19 Other lessons are also incorporated such as (i) more accurate cost estimates and design and/or bills of quantity that \nconsider local conditions and climate change impacts, and (ii) strengthening the capacity development component. \n20 The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) originally planned to finance part of the rural road connectivity \nprogram but has shifted its strategic focus from the transport sector to urban transport in Colombo. However, \ncofinancing opportunities with other development partners will be further explored in subsequent tranches \n21 World Bank. 2016.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n25.  The RDA has identified the projects to be included under the investment program on the \nbasis of specific selection criteria.29 Engineering designs have been prepared for the project roads \nby RDA engineers, which are optimized for local conditions, construction efficiency, and economy, \nwith due attention to climate change impacts.30 The designs use a higher-standard asphalt \npavement  than  the  traditionally  used  bituminous  surface  treatment,  in  order  to  reduce \nmaintenance requirements and increase long-term economic efficiency. The RDA will strengthen \ncommunity participation through a context-sensitive design approach to accommodate local \nrequests and concerns. Civil works contracts include 3-year performance-based maintenance \n(PBM) (5-year PBM for national roads) to ensure efficient maintenance and implementation \nperformance of contractors. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n26.  Economic analysis. The economic analysis of the investment program follows ADB \nguidelines, and compares life-cycle costs in with- and without-project scenarios, using a 9% \ndiscount rate and the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) as decision criteria.31 All roads \nproposed under all tranches of the time-slice investment program were evaluated. Quantified \nbenefits include savings in vehicle operation costs, travel time, and road maintenance costs, as \nwell as a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions. The overall EIRR of the investment program is \nestimated to be 17.2%, with an estimated poverty impact ratio of 34.0%.32 The sensitivity analysis \ndemonstrated the robustness of the projects. \n \n27.  Financial sustainability. The project will not generate revenue. Financial requirements \nfor the maintenance of road assets will decrease in the first 10 years after construction due to (i) \nlower routine maintenance costs resulting from improved pavement conditions, and (ii) the \ninclusion of PBM contracts. After the PBM contracts elapse, project road maintenance will \nbecome the responsibility of respective road agencies. The incremental recurrent costs of national \nroads are estimated to be 0.7% of the RDA maintenance budget, while the incremental recurrent \n                                                \n29 The main criteria for rural roads are (i) number of households (50 or more); (ii) availability of electricity and water; (iii) \npresence of health and medical facilities, educational facilities, and commercial and market facilities; and (iv) absence \nof land acquisition, and environmentally sensitive areas. \n30 The incremental cost to address climate change adaptation is estimated at 5.2% of the civil works cost. This includes \nthe additional cost of drainage, culverts, retaining walls, and concrete pavement in flooded areas to address identified \nclimate risks and vulnerabilities such as flooding, soil erosion, and landslide. \n31 ADB. 2017. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n32 The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) (excluding carbon dioxide emissions savings) is 17.1%. \n ", "8 \ncosts of provincial and local roads in Eastern, Northern, and Uva provinces are estimated to \nrequire a 2%\u20137% increase in the maintenance budget of provincial authorities, and a 29%\u201340% \nincrease in the maintenance budget of local authorities.33 Improvements in institutional funding \narrangements are required to ensure the sustainability of provincial and local road investments \nover  their  design  life.  In  addition  to  the  government\u2019s  commitment  to  allocate  sufficient \nmaintenance  funds,  the  RDA  will  recruit  institutional  management  specialists  under  the \ninvestment program to propose feasible policy improvements or alternatives to the existing road \nmaintenance scheme. ADB will closely monitor progress during program implementation. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n28.  Policy and legal. Implementation arrangements will involve the central, provincial, and \nlocal  governments.34 At  the  central  level,  the  Ministry  of  Higher  Education  and  Highways \n(MOHEH) is responsible for the formulation of policies and performance monitoring. The RDA \nwas established as a statutory authority with separate legal status by the Road Development \nAuthority Act, 1981. The RDA chairperson reports to the MOHEH secretary. Under the 13th \namendment to the Constitution (enacted in 1987) and the Pradheshiya Sabha Act, No. 15 of 1987, \nprovincial councils (which constitute provincial-level government agencies) are responsible for the \nwork of local authorities within the areas served by the provincial councils. In keeping with the \ndevolution norm of Sri Lanka, the RDA operates as though it was contracted by the provincial \nauthorities  to  construct  roads  that  belong  to  the  local  authorities.  The  implementation \narrangements satisfy the RDA Act, which requires the RDA to consult with other government \nagencies  on  projects  within  their  areas.  The  national  steering  committee  and  provincial \ncoordination committees will ensure proper coordination. \n \n29.  Institutional capacity. MOHEH and the RDA have sufficient capacity, experience, and \ninstitutional  strength  to  procure  civil  works,  equipment,  select  consultants,  and  administer \ncontracts. Provincial, district, and local authorities will participate in the steering and coordination \ncommittees, with consideration of their respective institutional capacity. \n \n30.  Financial management. The RDA has prior and ongoing experience in implementing \nADB-funded projects. A financial management assessment of the RDA found that the RDA\u2019s \noverall risk is moderate. The RDA has a dedicated project accounting and finance team with \nsuitably qualified accountants. The RDA will establish and maintain separate project records and \naccounts to identify the financing resources received and expenditures made for the project, thus \nensuring an adequate audit trail. The government\u2019s Auditor General\u2019s Department will audit the \nproject accounts and financial statements annually, following international auditing standards. \n \n31.  Procurement and anticorruption. Procurement will be undertaken in accordance with \nthe ADB Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). All consultants will be \nengaged in accordance with the ADB Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended \nfrom time to time). The Bribery Act, No. 11 of 1954 (as amended from time to time); the Declaration \nof Asset and Liabilities Act, No. 1 of 1975; and the Permanent Commission to Investigate \nAllegations of Bribery and Corruption Act, No. 19 of 1994 provide a legal basis for addressing \nbribery  and  corruption.  The  auditor  general  will  check  procurement  activities.  The  ADB \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the \ngovernment,  MOHEH,  and  the  RDA.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \n                                                \n33 Costs in Western Province are expected to decrease by 3% of the maintenance budget. \n34 The governance arrangements for the proposed investment program are the same as those used in the first program. \nNo major issues have been observed in terms of the RDA\u2019s implementation capacity. ", "9 \nmeasures are described in the facility administration manual. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n32.  Poverty  reduction  and  social  impacts.  The  investment  program  will  improve  the \nsocioeconomic situation and enhance poverty reduction in Eastern, Northern, Uva, and Western \nprovinces  (para.  26).  About  9.8  million  people  live  in  the  project  area\u2019s  145  divisions.  A \nsocioeconomic assessment found that the main sources of income for users of the proposed \nroads are agriculture, fisheries, self-employment, and wage labor. Employment in the public and \nprivate sectors is significant in larger towns. Over 90% of surveyed households described the \ncurrent road conditions as bad. Communities indicated that poor road conditions affected day-to-\nday  activities.  Improved  access  to  education  and  health,  road  safety,  and  increased  job \nopportunities were listed among the positive benefits expected to result from the improvements. \nMany of the roads to be improved under the investment program are in areas that were affected \nby the 26-year civil conflict, and upgrading these roads will benefit post-conflict rehabilitation and \nthe continued revival of the rural economy. \n \n33.  Gender and development. The socioeconomic assessment found that women were \nactively engaged in family and community activities and decision-making processes, although \nresults vary among provinces. Women surveyed for the assessment said they were willing to \nparticipate in the projects by (i) working as maintenance or civil works wage laborers, and/or (ii) \noperating a small business to provide services to contractors. The gender action plan prepared \nfor tranche 1 includes key gender mainstreaming activities.35 Tranche 1 is classified as effective \ngender mainstreaming. \n \n34.  HIV, AIDS, and human trafficking. The HIV prevalence rate is low in Sri Lanka. The \nestablishment of the National Program for Sexually Transmitted Diseases and AIDS Control helps \nrefurbish health clinics and establish outreach and awareness programs throughout the country. \nThe investment program has incorporated measures to mitigate HIV and AIDS risks by providing \nawareness training for civil works contractors and for project-affected communities at prominent \nvillage locations. Awareness-raising activities will be conducted separately for men and women. \nThe social impact assessment did not identify human trafficking as a significant issue in the project \narea. It is anticipated that civil works contractors will hire local laborers; as a mitigation measure, \naffected communities will be provided with awareness training on human trafficking. Specific \nprovisions in the bid documents and the works contracts financed under the program will ensure \nthat the contractors follow all applicable international core labor standards and national labor laws. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n35.  Involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. Projects identified under the time-\nslice investment program are classified category B for involuntary resettlement in accordance with \n                                                \n35 Gender Action Plan: Tranche 1 (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). Key gender \nmainstreaming activities for tranche 1 include (i) ensuring at least 35% of those engaged for design consultations \nare women; (ii) integrating features that increase safety and meet the needs of the elderly, women, children, and the \ndisabled; (iii) encouraging employment of local women as road construction workers; (iv) ensuring that at least 30% \nof local employees hired for road maintenance are women and that they receive equal wages for equal work; (v) \nconducting awareness training on road safety, HIV, and sexually transmitted infections, with women comprising a \nminimum of 40% of participants; (vi) appointing gender focal persons at all levels; (vii) building knowledge and skills \nof the transport sector on gender and inclusivity; and (viii) developing an online grievance reporting mechanism, and \ntracking gender-disaggregated data regarding complainants. \n ", "10 \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).36 Rural access road and national road improvements \nwill be made within the existing alignments, with no widening required. Due diligence identified no \nimpacts to land, structures, private trees, or community resource properties. However, minimal \nland acquisition for national roads may be required at black spots to ensure road safety. A \ngrievance redress mechanism will be established in all project areas. The resettlement framework \nwill guide compliance with social safeguard requirements.37 A voluntary land donation system was \nused effectively in the first program, and will be used if land should be required for rural roads \nduring  project  implementation.  Specific  procedural  requirements  for  land  donation  involve \ncomprehensive  consultations  with  the  communities,  and  are  specified  in  the  resettlement \nframework. The government will ensure that land donation is undertaken without coercion and \ndocumented in a transparent manner, and will have the process verified by an independent \nmonitor. National roads requiring land acquisition will follow government and ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement requirements, as specified in the resettlement framework. The identified projects \nare not expected to impact indigenous peoples and are consequently classified category C. An \nindigenous peoples planning framework has been prepared.38 \n \n36.  Environmental impact. The scope of works under the investment program involves \nrehabilitation and maintenance of existing rural and national roads. Therefore, the identified \nprojects are classified category B in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. The \nRDA has prepared consolidated provincial initial environmental examination (IEE) reports for the \nfour provinces, and an environmental assessment and review framework to guide compliance \nwith the environmental safeguard requirements of the government and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement during program implementation.39 The IEE and the environmental assessment and \nreview  framework  fulfill  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  requirements.  Anticipated \nenvironmental impacts entail typical road construction-related issues such as generation of dust, \nnoise, exhaust, and waste from construction sites and worker camps; water contamination; \noccupational health and safety; erosion; and siltation. The standard environmental management \nplan (EMP), which forms part of the IEE, includes mitigation measures. Contractors will be \nrequired to prepare contract package-specific EMPs based on the final design, road-specific \nenvironment checklists, and the standard EMP. The RDA conducted consultations during project \npreparation, and the IEEs incorporate the concerns of the affected persons and stakeholders. \n \n37.  Each provincial project implementation unit will include a senior environment safeguards \nofficer and environment assistants to monitor the implementation of environment safeguards. In \naddition, the experienced safeguards team from the RDA\u2019s Environment and Social Development \nDivision  will  provide  technical  support  and  monitor  the  implementation  of  safeguards.  The \nenvironment  specialists  and  project  implementation  consultants  will  also  support  program \nimplementation  units  in  monitoring  and  reporting  on  safeguards  implementation.  Project \nimplementation consultants will hold regular safeguards training workshops. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n38.  The overall risk assessment is moderate. Major risks are (i) insufficient budget allocation \nunder the fiscal consolidation, and (ii) inadequate maintenance of the road asset. These risks and \n                                                \n36 The RDA has identified and prepared all projects under the time-slice MFF concept. Tranche 1 and all future tranches \nare classified category B for involuntary resettlement and the environment and category C for indigenous peoples. \n37 Resettlement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). The resettlement framework \nwas disclosed on the ADB website in June 2017. \n38 Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n39 Initial Environmental Examination and Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list \nof linked documents in Appendix 2). Both were disclosed on the ADB website in June 2017. ", "11 \nmitigating measures are described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.40 \nThe integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n \n39.  The government, MOHEH, and the RDA have assured ADB that implementation of the \ninvestment program shall conform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning \nanticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and \ndisbursement, as described in detail in the facility administration manual and loan documents. \n \n40.  The government, MOHEH, and the RDA have given ADB certain undertakings for the \nMFF, which are set forth in the framework financing agreement. Specific covenants agreed to by \nthe government, MOHEH, and the RDA with respect to individual tranches under the MFF are set \nforth in the loan agreement and project agreement for the respective tranches. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n41.  I am satisfied that the proposed multitranche financing facility would comply with the \nArticles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and, acting in the absence of the \nPresident, under the provisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend \nthat the Board approve the multitranche financing facility to the Democratic Socialist Republic of \nSri Lanka for the Second Integrated Road Investment Program in an aggregate principal amount \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $900,000,000, which comprises \n(i)  the provision of loans from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in regular terms, with \ninterest and other terms to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, and \n(ii)  the provision of loans from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in concessional terms, \nwith interest and other terms to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s applicable \npolicies relating to ordinary capital resources, \nand is subject to such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those \nset forth in the framework financing agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \nStephen Groff \nVice-President \n6 September 2017\n                                                \n40 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "12  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK FOR THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \nImpact the Program is Aligned with \nConnectivity between rural communities and socioeconomic centers in Sri Lanka improved (Public \nInvestment Programme, 2017\u20132020)a \n \nPerformance Indicators with  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome  By 2027:     \nTransport  a.
