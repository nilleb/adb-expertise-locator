INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Viet Nam requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide \nsupport in developing and implementing a more cost-reflective pricing regime for electricity \ntransmission, an essential element in accommodating grid reliability and access to wholesale \ncompetition by 2017 in Viet Nam. The proposed technical assistance (TA) was developed and \nprepared in close communication and coordination with the Electricity Regulatory Authority of \nViet  Nam  (ERAV).  An  understanding  on  the  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  implementation \narrangements, costs and financing, and terms of reference for the TA was reached on 13 July \n2012. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix1.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Since  enacting  the  Electricity  Law  in  2005,  Viet  Nam  has  demonstrated  a  strong \ncommitment to creating a competitive power market and broadening ownership in the sector. \nThe key objectives of unbundling Viet Nam\u2019s power sector are (i) improving efficiency through \ncompetition, (ii) minimizing costs to consumers, and (iii) increasing financing and managerial \nresources from outside the state-operated system to meet the sector\u2019s investment requirements. \nA road map approved in 2006 describes the reform process spanning about 20 years and to be \nimplemented in three phases: (i) creating competition in generation activities by allowing power \nplants to sell electricity to a single buyer (2009\u20132014), (ii) introducing a competitive wholesale \nmarket for bulk sale to distribution companies (2015\u20132022), (iii) establishing a competitive retail \nmarket (from 2023). \n \n3.  As  of  2012,  the  key  organizations  in  Viet  Nam\u2019s  power  sector  are  the  Directorate \nGeneral of Energy and ERAV, both under the Ministry of Industry and Trade, and Viet Nam \nElectricity (EVN). The Directorate General of Energy guides the development of the power \nsector and is responsible for overall energy planning and policy. ERAV is the regulatory agency, \nresponsible for establishing the power market, power planning, tariff regulation, and licensing. \nEVN, the country\u2019s national power utility, is a vertically integrated holding company responsible \nfor the whole chain of electricity production, transmission, and distribution.  \n \n4.  Restructuring of the electricity sector began when EVN was established as a holding \ncompany  in  2006.  The  National  Load  Dispatch  Center  and  the  Electric  Power  Trading \nCompany,  the  country\u2019s  single  buyer,  were  set  up  under  EVN.  The  National  Power \nTransmission Corporation (NPT) was established in 2008 as a company wholly owned by EVN. \nNPT is responsible for investment in, and the management and operation of, 500-kilovolt and \n220-kilovolt transmission lines and associated substations. NPT consists of three power project \nmanagement boards that implement investment projects undertaken by NPT. The northern, \ncentral,  southern,  Ha  Noi,  and  Ho  Chi  Minh  power  corporations,  established  in  2010  and \ncurrently wholly owned by EVN, are responsible for the distribution network. In June 2012, \ndecisions2 were issued to group EVN-owned power generators and to establish three power \ngeneration  companies  wholly  owned  by  EVN.  The  generation  companies  will  be  mainly \nresponsible for undertaking investments in, and managing the operation of, assigned electricity-\ngenerating projects. In addition, several state-owned enterprises are involved in independent \npower generation projects, notably the oil and gas company PetroVietNam and the mining \ncompany Vinacomin, and the role of independent power producers is increasing rapidly. During \n2011\u20132020, 46% of new power-generating capacity is planned as coming from foreign and \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 28 November 2012. \n2  Decisions nos. 3023/QD-BCT, 3024/QD-BCT, 3025/QD-BCT. \n ", "2 \ndomestic  private  sector  entities.  Equitization  of  EVN\u2019s  power  generation  and  distribution \ncompanies is in process. However, the government specified that the national transmission \nnetwork, and large hydro and nuclear power generation projects that are of high importance for \nsocioeconomic and national security needs, will not be privatized.  \n \n5.  Implementing the  reforms  cannot  be  done  through  unbundling  alone.  It  will  require \nformulating and implementing new regulations and updating existing ones that reform pricing \nand other mechanisms to allow for developing efficient, financially viable, and operationally \nsustainable and reliable power market infrastructure. \n \n6.  In 2010, Circular 14 Specifying the Methodology for Transmission Pricing was issued, \nwhich implements the processes and procedures for development, issuance, and regulation of \nwheeling charges. In January 2012, Circular 14 was amended mainly to align the review and \napplication time frame of the transmission charge with NPT\u2019s fiscal year from 1 January to \n31 December (previously the application time frame was from 1 March to 28 February). The \ncurrent transmission pricing methodology follows the principle of marginal cost pricing under the \nconstraint of a revenue or rate-of-return approach. The methodology does not reflect (i) time \nand geographical differences, (ii) connection costs, (iii) capacity charges, and (iv) treatment of \nnetwork congestions. Currently, the transmission tariff is charged 100% to distributors and no \ncharge applies to generators. Furthermore, effective implementation of the regulation is limited \nas ERAV lacks the required data and data management systems to effectively determine the \nvarious components comprising the transmission tariff. Hence, current transmission tariffs do \nnot accurately reflect the cost of supply, which undermines the financial sustainability of the \npower transmission company, NPT. \n \n7.  Although affordability and public welfare must be considered at Viet Nam\u2019s stage of \ndevelopment, the government recognizes that changes in power market prices are inevitable to \nstrengthen the financial capacity of power sector entities and allow these entities to implement \nthe  large  investment requirements  (investment  needs for  Viet  Nam\u2019s  transmission  network \nupgrade and expansion are estimated at $8 billion for 2011\u20132020). Transmission charges were \nincreased by 14.3% in March 2011 to D77.5 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) and by 7.5% in December \n2011 to D83.3/kWh. Furthermore, in line with Viet Nam\u2019s reform process to gradually establish a \ncompetitive power generation and wholesale market, the current transmission tariff structure \nneeds to be reviewed and made more consistent with the country\u2019s power sector developments \nby ensuring non-discriminatory access to and use of the transmission networks.  \n \n8.  Recognizing the need to overcome constraints in the power sector, the government \napproved on 27 July 2011 the national Power Development Master Plan (PDMP) VII. With the \nPDMP VII, the government laid out a detailed road map and reform framework that emphasizes, \namong other aspects, strengthening the financial capacity and operational performance of the \ncountry\u2019s power sector entities. Furthermore, through the undertakings under ADB\u2019s Power \nTransmission Investment Program, a multitranche financing facility, the government agreed to \nset and implement transmission charges so that NPT can progressively achieve the financial \nperformance objectives of a (i) debt-service coverage ratio of 1.5; (ii) self-financing ratio of 25%; \nand (iii) debt\u2013equity ratio of 75:25 by 2015, and maintain them thereafter.  \n \n9.  The TA is strategically aligned with the government\u2019s road map and reform framework \nlaid out in the PDMP VII. There, the government specified to gradually increase electricity tariffs \n ", "3 \nby at least 5% per year from $0.06/kWh in 2010 to $0.08/kWh in 2015. Electricity tariff increases \nshould facilitate the implementation of a more cost-reflective transmission tariff.3 \n \n10.  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2012\u201320154 supports  the  government\u2019s  aim  to \nachieve continuous (i) inclusive economic growth, (ii) environmentally sustainable growth, and \n(iii) regional integration. Coupled with sustained growth in electricity demand, it will require \nADB\u2019s continuous engagement and long-term commitment in the energy sector with both loans \nand TA. As Viet Nam is close to 100% electrified and the private sector is increasingly involved \nin power generation, ADB's Southeast Asia Department will continue to focus its assistance on \ntransmission,  one  of  its  areas  of  strength  as  identified  in  the  energy  sector  Assessment, \nStrategy, and Roadmap for Viet Nam.  \n \n11.  ADB\u2019s Power Transmission Investment Program provides NPT with critical financing \nsupport  in  expanding  and  upgrading  the  country\u2019s  transmission  network  in  line  with  the \nobjectives and time frame of the PDMP VII.5 As part of ongoing TA on Increasing the Efficiency \nof NPT through Targeted Capacity Building, ADB also supports NPT in calculating capital, \noperational, and other financial expenditures for submission to ERAV in setting and approving \ntransmission prices.6 By providing assistance in developing and implementing a cost-reflective \ntransmission pricing regime, the TA will effectively complement ADB\u2019s infrastructure financing \nsupport.7  \n \n12.  Development partner coordination has in the past provided the government and ERAV \nwith opportunities to synergize interventions and capitalize on best practices. The World Bank \nhas over the past 5 years supported ERAV in developing the regulatory framework for electricity \nretail tariffs and electricity licensing. The World Bank will continue providing support focusing \nprimarily on establishing the regulatory environment for effective demand-side management. \nWith this TA, ADB thus continues to complement existing and ongoing support of development \npartners in establishing an effective energy-regulating framework in Viet Nam. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The TA will contribute to the efficient operation of a competitive power generation and \nwholesale  electricity  market  in  Viet  Nam.  The  outcome  is  a  cost-reflective,  transparent \ntransmission pricing regime. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The TA  entails  (i)  a  detailed  study  of  electricity  transmission  pricing  arrangements; \n(ii) recommendations for improving the current transmission pricing methodology, standards, \nand procedures in accordance with the establishment of a competitive power generation and \n                                                \n3  The gradual increase in electricity tariffs is specified as an indicator in ADB\u2019s energy sector results framework, \n2012\u20132015 for Viet Nam.  \n4  ADB. 2012.

A set of practical and implementable proposals for transmission pricing arrangements, \nas well as support in effectively determining various transmission pricing components is to be \ndeveloped with the objective that electricity transmission charges will (i) be more cost-reflective; \n(ii) promote socioeconomic growth; (iii) provide fairness to all users of the network and be \nrelated to the utilization of the network; (iv) support efficient use of electricity, operation of and \ninvestment in the network, so that costs are minimized in the long run; and (v) be transparent. \n \n16.  The TA is divided into three outputs: \n \n(i)  Review and assessment of electricity transmission pricing arrangements. It \nwill involve a comprehensive review of Viet Nam\u2019s current transmission pricing \nmethodology, available data, tools, and procedures in determining the various \ntransmission  tariff  components,  the  arrangements  for  transmission  pricing \nreviews, and adjustment mechanisms.  \n(ii)  Solutions  to  improve  transmission  pricing  arrangements. This will entail \ncomparisons  with  transmission  pricing  regimes,  procedures,  and  assessment \nmechanisms in up to five international jurisdictions and recommendations on \nsuitable  ways  to  improve  Viet  Nam\u2019s  transmission  pricing  methodology, \nprocedures,  and  assessment  mechanisms,  also  in  the  context  of  increased \nregional power trade.  \n(iii)  Determination  of  pricing  components  for  effective  implementation  of \ntransmission  pricing.  It  will  involve  comprehensive  support  in  gathering \nrequired data; developing standards; updating and, if required, developing data \nmanagement  systems  and  models,  procedures,  and  mechanisms  to  set  and \nimplement transmission pricing in a transparent manner. It will also include on-\nthe-job training to ERAV staff in sustainably setting, reviewing, and adjusting \ntransmission prices. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, of which $800,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office space, and other in-kind contributions. \nThe cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  Implementation of the TA is expected to begin on 1 August 2013 for completion by \n31 December 2014 and closing of the TA by 30 June 2015. ERAV will be the executing agency \nand the Tariffs and Fees Department under ERAV will be the implementing agency. Within ADB, \nthe Energy Division of the Southeast Asia Department will manage the TA. Disbursements \nunder this TA will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook \n(2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n19.  A consulting firm will be engaged to provide about 29 person-months of consulting \nservices (21 person-months of international and 8 person-months of national consultants). The \nconsulting team will consist of a transmission tariff policy advisor and team leader (international, \n8 person-months), a transmission tariff specialist (international, 8 person-months), a financial \n ", "5 \nspecialist (international, 2 person-months), and two energy specialists (international, 3 person-\nmonths; national, 8 person-months). ADB will engage the consultants in accordance with its \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Given the nature \nand complexity of the assignment, ADB will adopt the quality- and cost-based selection method \nusing a quality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10 and a simplified technical proposal. The outline terms of \nreference for consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n20.  Progress and findings to achieve the outputs will be reflected in the inception, midterm, \nand draft and final reports, as well as biweekly progress reports. Consultants will have to \nundertake the review and assessment of the transmission pricing arrangements within 3 months \nof starting the assignment and submit their findings as an inception report. The findings will be \npresented and discussed with stakeholders in a workshop to be organized by the consultants \nand  ERAV.  Specification  of  solutions for  improving  transmission  pricing  would  need  to  be \ncompleted within 7 months and recommendations will need to be submitted in the form of a \nmidterm report. The consultants and ERAV will organize a stakeholder workshop to discuss and \nagree on solutions. An agreement will be supported through a memorandum of understanding. \nThe determination of transmission pricing components would need to be completed within \n15 months  of  starting  the  assignment.  All  activities  and  outputs  achieved  need  to  be \ndocumented and will be part of the draft and final reports. In addition, consultants will be \nrequired to submit biweekly progress reports to ERAV and ADB. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n21.

Proposed solutions should factor in: \n(i)  applicability of transmission charges to different network users; \n(ii)  impact  on  the  different  network  users  of  incorporating  additional \ntransmission pricing components in the transmission tariff structure; \n(iii)  cost reflectivity of the transmission pricing methodology; \n(iv)  expected level of transmission charges; \n(v)  financial viability of the power transmission company; \n(vi)  suitability for enhancing regional (cross-border) power trade; \n(vii)  merits, adequacy, and timing of introducing time-of-use and geographical \nsignals, capacity charges, connection charges, and treatment of network \ncongestions; \n(viii)  accessibility  to  data,  information  sources,  and  models  including \ninformation  technology  system,  data,  model,  and  procedural,  human \nresource requirements, and associated costs; \n(ix)  short-, medium- and long-term financial and economic costs and benefits \nfor  implementing  a  change  in  transmission  pricing  arrangements, \nincluding impact on electricity retail tariff; \n(x)  timing for any changes to the transmission pricing structure, including the \ntransition process for amendments, and accounting for the government\u2019s \ncommitment; \n(xi)  adequate  time  frame  and  index  mechanism  for  transmission,  pricing \nadjustments, and the criteria to be used in conducting regular reviews; \nand \n(xii)  any other related issues, as appropriate. \n \nC.  Determination  of  Pricing  Components  for  Effective  Implementation  of \nTransmission Pricing \n \n7.  This output entails: \n(i)  gathering required data, as well as updating and, if required, developing new \nmodels, procedures, and mechanisms for calculating standards and transmission \ncharge tariff components following the agreements reached under outputs A and \nB, including (a) determination of the standard profit allowance and assessment of \nweighted  average  cost  of  capital,  (b)  determination  of  the  capacity  charge \ncomponent,  (c)  determination  of  the  connection  charge  component, \n(d) determination  of  unit  costs  for  transmission  revenue  requirements,  and \n(e) determination of any other standards and transmission charge components \nas identified under outputs A and B; \n ", "  Appendix 3  11 \n(ii)  revising and developing staff manuals and guidelines for setting, reviewing, and \nadjusting transmission price components; and \n(iii)  providing on the job-training to staff of the Electricity Regulatory Authority of \nVietnam  responsible  for  setting,  reviewing,  and  adjusting  transmission  price \ncomponents. \n \n "], "metadata": {"Author": "Asian Development Bank", "CreationDate": "D:20121218145853Z", "Creator": "Microsoft\u00ae Office Word 2007", "Keywords": "Electricity Transmission Pricing Review in the Context of Power Sector Restructuring", "ModDate": "D:20121221111041+08'00'", "Producer": "Microsoft\u00ae Office Word 2007", "Title": "TAR: Viet Nam: Electricity Transmission Pricing Review in the Context of Power Sector Restructuring"}, "author_page": " \nCURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 5 November 2012) \nCurrency unit  \u2013  dong (D) \nD1.00  =  $0.0000480 \n$1.00  =  D20,832.47 \n \n \nABBREVIATIONS \n \n  ADB  \u2013  Asian Development Bank \n  ERAV  \u2013  Electricity Regulatory Authority of Viet Nam \n  EVN  \u2013  Viet Nam Electricity \n  kWh  \u2013  kilowatt-hour \n  NPT  \u2013  National Power Transmission Corporation \nPDMP  \u2013  Power Development Master Plan \n  TA  \u2013  technical assistance \n \n \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CLASSIFICATION \n \nType  \u2013  Policy and advisory technical assistance (PATA) \nTargeting  \u2013  General intervention \nclassification \nSector (subsector)  \u2013  Energy (energy sector development) \nThemes (subthemes)  \u2013  Economic growth  (widening  access  to markets  and  economic \nopportunities), capacity development (institutional development) \nLocation (impact)  \u2013  Rural (low), urban (low), national (high), regional (medium) \n \n \nNOTE \n \nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars.  \n \nVice-President  S.
