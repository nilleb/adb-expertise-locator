INTRODUCTION \n1.  The capacity development technical assistance (TA) for the Third Primary Education \nDevelopment Project1 is included in the country operations business plan, 2012\u20132014.2 The \nGovernment  of  Bangladesh,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  and  eight  development \npartners3 have jointly developed the Third Primary Education Development Program, which has \nseveral innovative features.4 The project provides financing depending on the achievement of \nselected  results\u2014called  disbursement-linked  indicators  (DLIs)\u2014and  the  government  and \ndevelopment  partners  have  agreed  on  a  joint  mechanism  to  review,  verify,  and  improve \nreporting on DLIs and other results. Because ADB and the development partners use the \ngovernment\u2019s  treasury  system  for  project  disbursement  and  financial  management,  close \nfiduciary oversight and support for system improvement in public financial management (PFM) \nwas also agreed. Subsequently, the government has requested ADB\u2019s support to strengthen \nproject  management  in  the  areas  of  fiduciary  risk  management,  and  result  reporting  and \nverification. The TA was further discussed and agreed during a joint fiduciary review in March \n2012. 5  The  government  concurred  with  the  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  implementation \narrangements,  cost,  financing  arrangements,  and  terms  of  reference.  The  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Bangladesh has made significant achievement in increasing the participation of boys \nand girls in primary education. The major remaining, systemic challenges\u2014reducing dropout \nand repetition, and improving the quality of education, particularly in disadvantaged areas\u2014are \naddressed by the National Education Policy (NEP),6 which aims to reduce disparities between \ndifferent  types  of  schools,  and  expand  and  improve  primary  education  in  disadvantaged \nlocations in rural communities and urban slums. The Second Primary Education Development \nProgram,  2003\u20132011  largely  contributed  to  achieving  the  Millennium  Development  Goal \npertaining to primary education participation.7 This program also initiated key reforms to improve \nthe quality of, and governance and management in, education. For instance, the introduction of \nresults-based management has led to the publication of an annual sector performance report \nthat helps monitor progress on key performance indicators and primary school quality standards. \nThis focus on results-based management has also increased awareness of the importance of \nplanning for and reporting on results, rather than inputs and activities. The project builds on the \nSecond Primary Education Development Program\u2019s achievements and experiences to pursue \nthe government\u2019s reform agenda in primary education, in line with the NEP objectives. \n \n3.  Focus on results. Lessons drawn from the previous program show that success in \nmanaging reforms in large systems\u2014such as the Bangladesh primary education  system\u2014\n                                                \n1  ADB. 2011.

Manila. \n ", "2   \ndepends largely on the government\u2019s capacity to effectively target, plan, and manage resources \nto achieve the intended results. As a consequence, the Third Primary Education Development \nProject has shifted from a project approach (with a focus on activities and inputs) to a broader \nprogram approach (with a focus on results). The project intends to develop institutional capacity \nin planning and financing based on results, to help establish a robust monitoring and evaluation \nsystem, and to promote accountability through improved result reporting. The project focuses on \nachieving outputs in four areas: (i) improved teaching and learning for all, (ii) reduced disparities \nin access and participation, (iii) decentralized and effective organization, and (iv) improved \nplanning and management. The project\u2019s financing depends on the government achieving a set \nof nine annual DLIs, which are outputs deemed essential to meeting the project\u2019s objectives. \nThe  nine  DLIs  have  been  selected  as  results  that  are  realistic,  under  the  control  of  the \nresponsible agencies, and verifiable. A 5-year DLI matrix defining the annual DLIs has been \ndeveloped, along with a detailed protocol, and mechanisms for government reporting on DLI \nachievement and independent verification from the development partners. The independent \nverification mechanism is intended to give assurance to the government and development \npartners regarding the accuracy of the DLI reports, and help develop system capacity in data \ncollection, analysis, and result reporting. \n \n4.   Use  of  country  system  and  fiduciary  risk  management.  The  fiduciary  risk \nassessment,  which  was  undertaken  during  project  preparation,  advised  ADB  and  other \ndevelopment partners to use the government\u2019s treasury system for disbursement and financial \nmanagement.  The  ADB  loan  and  development  partners\u2019  funds  are  channeled  to  the \ngovernment\u2019s treasury to finance eligible project expenditures, which are included under defined \nprogram budget headings in the government\u2019s chart of accounts. One of the conditions for \ndisbursement from ADB and development partners is timely submission of accurate quarterly \ninterim  unaudited  financial  reports  generated  by  the  government  integrated  budget  and \naccounting  system.  Therefore,  the  fiduciary  risk  assessment  conducted  during  preparation \nfocused on the government\u2019s PFM system and identified risks associated with government \nmanagement of funds and accounting for project expenditures. These include, for instance, \npayment  processing  time,  reconciliation  of  accounts,  and  segregation  of  advances  from \nexpenditures. A PFM action plan was developed to manage the financial management risks in \naccounting, auditing, and procurement. Periodic monitoring of the implementation of the PFM \naction plan and updating of the required actions support improved governance and better \npractices in PFM and provide assurance that funds are being used for the intended purpose and \nare accounted for. The government and development partners agreed on a mechanism for \nclose fiduciary oversight and support for system improvement in PFM through regular review of \nprocurement and financial management activities by the joint procurement and finance working \ngroup (PFWG) of the government and the project development partners. It also comprises \nquarterly  and  annual  fiduciary  reviews  (AFRs),  which  focus  on  selected  areas  of  system \nimprovement in PFM. ADB and the International Development Association have been tasked \nwith  managing  project  joint  fiduciary  oversight,  including  financing  and  joint  technical \nsupervision of the work of the consultants.8 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n5.  The TA will support NEP objectives to achieve education for all by 2015, particularly in \nthe area of good governance and capacity development. It will support project management in \nthe areas of fiduciary risk management and result reporting and verification. \n                                                \n8  Fiduciary oversight arrangements and procurement arrangements are described in Annex IX of the Joint Financing \nArrangement signed by the government and development partners in December 2011. \n ", "  3 \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The expected impact is an efficient, inclusive, and equitable primary education system in \nBangladesh. The impact will be measured through changes in (i) the net primary enrollment \nrate, (ii) gender parity index for gross primary enrolment, (iii) completion rate, and (iv) number of \ninput years per graduate.  The impact of the TA is based on the outcome expected at the end of \nthe project. \n \n7.  The expected outcome is an increased assurance regarding fiduciary concerns and \nresult reporting for the project. The TA aims to ensure that funds are used efficiently and \neffectively to achieve the intended results and are accounted for. Outcomes will be measured \nthrough: (i) agreed actions for 2012 of the PFM action plan being fully implemented by May \n2013, and (ii) result reporting fully meeting the protocol agreed through the September 2012 DLI \nverification. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The first output is improved fiduciary risk management. The TA will support quarterly and \nannual fiduciary reviews. The quarterly fiduciary reviews (QFRs) focus on reviewing government \nquarterly  interim  unaudited  financial  reports,  testing  implementation  of  the  government \nintegrated budget and accounting system, and quarterly procurement reviews. The AFRs will be \nconducted annually from October to March, for the duration of the TA (see para. 11 and footnote \n10), and will review the annual financial statement and the report of the auditor-general. Based \non the outcomes of the QFRs, the AFR will include an in-depth review of specific fiduciary risks \nareas, which will be identified annually. The selection of the areas for in-depth review under the \nAFR will be confirmed during the project joint annual review missions (JARMs) in May, and may \ninclude,  for  instance,  a  review  of  payment  processing,  including  sample  testing  using \ninformation from the integrated budget and accounting system generated reports and cash \nbooks of a sample of drawing and disbursement offices. Another area of review under the AFR \nmay be the delivery of stipends to primary schools children. The AFR also includes a post-\nprocurement review; this will require about 50% of the consultant\u2019s inputs, because it will assess \ncompliance  with  the  agreed  procurement  processes  and  cover  a  sample  of  15%\u201320%  of \ncontracts awarded during the year. The government and development partners will agree on a \nperiodic update of the PFM action plan based on the outcomes of the QFRs and AFRs. \n \n9.  The second output is the improved result reporting and data verification process. The TA \nwill support an independent verification of DLI achievement reports in selected areas. This \nincludes assessment of administrative and technical documents and data submitted by the \ngovernment, and field verification on a sample basis. The methodology of the independent \nverification will be confirmed during the JARM, and the assessment will be conducted annually \nfrom  July  to  August,  for  the  duration  of  the  TA  activities.  The  result  of  the  independent \nverification  will  enable  the  government  and  development  partners  to  agree  on  the  DLI \nachievement in a joint decision-making meeting in September. \n \n10.  The third output is the enhanced policy dialogue on system capacity development in \nPFM, results-based planning, financing, and reporting. Other key areas of policy reforms may \nbe identified during the JARM, such as public\u2013private partnerships and decentralization. The TA \nwill  support  workshops,  seminars,  and  studies  for  knowledge  sharing,  policy  reviews,  and \nplanning for institutional capacity development in PFM; results-based planning, financing, and \nreporting; and other key areas that may be identified. \n \n ", "4   \n11.  The TA builds on the results of the small-scale TA for Support for the Proposed Primary \nEducation Sector Development Program,9 which helped identify and plan critical activities in the \nareas of PFM and result reporting. Other development partners will provide complementary TA \nin the area of results monitoring and reporting. It is planned that additional resources from ADB \nand cofinancing partners will extend and expand TA activities in the subsequent years of the \nproject in line with the following expected outputs: (i) carrying out QFRs and AFRs, as well as \nspecial audits and public expenditure tracking surveys, as and if required; (ii) independent \nverification of DLI achievement reports in selected areas; and (iii) seminars and studies for \nknowledge sharing, policy reviews, and planning for institutional capacity development in PFM; \nresults-based planning, financing, and reporting; and other key areas identified. \n \n12.  Improved  institutional  capacity  in  PFM  and  results-based  planning,  financing,  and \nreporting will lead to better targeting, more effective use of funds, and good governance. This \nwill result in increased sector performance. High turnover of staff and lack of a conducive \npolitical environment to improve system capacity are risks that may undermine institutional \ncapacity development. Close oversight by ADB and other development partners and extensive \npolicy dialogue would help overcome such risks. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The government has requested ADB to finance $500,000 equivalent. The TA will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADB's Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). No financing \nis expected from the government. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  The Ministry of Primary and Mass Education will be the executing agency of the TA, and \nwill work in close consultation with the comptroller general of account under the Ministry of \nFinance, particularly in the area of financial management. \n \n15.  The TA will be conducted over a period of 12 months from the fielding of consultants, \nwhich is anticipated in July 2012.10 Therefore, the TA is expected to be completed in September \n2013. The TA will engage 8 person-months of international and 18 person-months of national \nconsultant services. ADB will recruit an audit firm to conduct the AFRs using bio-data technical \nproposal for the quality- and cost-based selection method (quality-cost ratio of 80:20). The firm \nwill  provide  4  person-months  of  international  and  12  person-months  of  national  consulting \nservices in financial audit and procurement audit. In addition, ADB will engage 3 person-months \nof international consulting services on an individual basis in PFM, and education monitoring and \nevaluation. Provision for a pool of 1 person-month of international and 6 person-months of \nnational  consulting  services  to  be recruited  individually  is  kept for flexibility.  Their  area of \nexpertise will be defined when the need arises within the TA output areas. The outline terms of \nreference for consultants are in Appendix 3. All recruitment will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Disbursements \nunder the TA will be  made in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n                                                \n9  ADB. 2010.

The TA  will  be  monitored  periodically  through a  review  of  consultants\u2019  reports  and \nmeetings of the PFWG of the project consortium of development partners. TA effectiveness will \nbe evaluated by ADB, and adjustment will be made as required, in close consultation with the \nPFWG. Lessons and best practices will be disseminated through the aide memoires of the \nproject JARMs and the uploading of selected reports on the project website. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Bangladesh for the Support for the Third Primary Education Development \nProject, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions  \nSummary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact  Net primary enrolment rate of 98% for  Annual sector performance  Risk \nboth genders in 2016 (baseline 2010:  report (ASPR) produced by \nAn efficient,  Conducive political \nboth genders 95.6%, boys 92.2%,  the Department of Primary \ninclusive, and  environment to improve \nand girls 99.2%)  Education (DPE) \nequitable  system capacity is absent \nprimary  Gender parity index for gross primary  ASPR (DPE) \neducation  enrolment rate 1.03 in 2016 (baseline   \nsystem in  2010: 1.078) \nBangladesh  \nPrimary education completion rate of  ASPR (DPE) \n67% in 2016 for both genders   \n(baseline 2010: 60.2 % for both \ngenders) \nMaximum of 7.5 input years per  ASPR (DPE) \ngraduate in 2016 (both genders) \n(baseline 2010: both genders 8.0, \nboys 8.0, and girls 8.1) \nOutcome  Agreed PFM action plan items for  Aide memoire review  Assumption \n2012 fully implemented by May 2013  mission, May 2013 \nIncreased  The government is \n(baseline 2011: not fully  (development partners and \nassurance on  committed to addressing \nimplemented)  the Government of \nfiduciary  fiduciary concerns. \nBangladesh) indicating the \nconcerns and \nstatus of PFM action plan   \nresults reporting \nimplementation, based on \nfor the Third  the annual and quarterly  Risk \nPrimary \nfiduciary review reports and \nEducation  High turnover of staff \nother special audits, if \na undermines institutional \nProject  \nrequired (development \ncapacity development. \npartners and DPE) \nResults reporting fully meets agreed  Aide memoire or \ndisbursement-linked indicator (DLI)  comparable decision-\nverification protocol in September  making document indicating \n2012 (baseline:2011: protocol not  status of DLI verification, \nfully met)  September 2012 \n(development partners and \nthe government) \nOutputs      Assumption \n1.
