The Government of Bangladesh (the Government) and the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)  are  currently  implementing  the  Urban  Primary  Health  Care  Project  (UPHCP).1  This \nProject, implemented through the Local Government Division (LGD) and 4 city corporations \n(CCs), supports contracting of nongovernment organizations (NGOs) to provide urban health \nservices for the poor. The Project is coming to a close in December 2004, and the Government \nhas requested for a second phase to consolidate achievements and expand to new urban \npopulations.2  The ADB Fact-Finding Mission visited Bangladesh on 9\u201319 June 2003 to review \nthe sector, assess the UPHCP, identify lessons learned, consult stakeholders, and plan project \npreparatory technical assistance (TA)3 for the proposed second UPHCP. In a wrap-up meeting \non 18 June 2003, ADB and the Government reached an understanding on the objectives, \nscope,  implementation  arrangements,  cost  estimates  and  financing  plan,  and  consulting \nservices of the TA. The project framework is in Appendix 1.    \n     \nII.     ISSUES \n2.  General. Bangladesh\u2019s population is estimated at 132 million people. About 30 million \nlive in urban areas, including 6 CCs and about 250 municipalities. Due to rural-urban migration, \nurban populations are increasing at the rate of about 6% per year. While the average per capita \nincome is about $370 per year, half of both urban and rural populations live in poverty, and \nabout half of the poor are very poor.4 The very poor live mostly in slums and squatter areas \nunder  harsh  social  and  environmental  conditions.  Despite  significant  gains  over  the  past \ndecade, the health, nutrition, and population status of the urban poor is unacceptable. The infant \nmortality rate in urban slums is about 100/1,000 live births, compared to about 80/1,000 live \nbirths in rural areas. Respiratory infections and diarrhea are common causes of child death. \nAbout 60% of children below the age of 5 years are underweight, and many lack micronutrients. \nThe number of maternal deaths is declining due to increased contraception resulting in reduced \nfertility.5 However, the maternal mortality ratio among pregnant women remains high due to \nearly marriage, poor nutrition, and other causes. The summary initial poverty and social analysis \nreport form is in Appendix 2. \n \n3.  The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MHFW) is responsible for sector policy, \nnational priority programs, hospitals, and rural primary health care (PHC).6 MHFW, with support \nof a consortium,7 has been implementing the Health and Population Sector Program for the past \n5 years. MHFW is not satisfied with the performance of the program, but remains supportive of \nthe sector-wide approach. It prepared the follow-up Health, Nutrition, and Population Sector \nProgram  (HNPSP),  this  time  including  nutrition  and  urban  health  services.  HNPSP  also \nproposes health sector reforms, including contracting out union services to NGOs, developing \ndistrict boards, increasing hospital autonomy, and providing a voucher system for the poor.      \n                                                 \n1    ADB. 1997. Loan 1538-BAN: Urban Primary Health Care Project (UPHCP). Manila.     \n2    The Bangladesh country strategy and program includes a second UPHCP in 2005 for $40 million.   \n3      The TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities (internet version) on 15 April 2003.    \n4   With average food intake below 2,122 kilocalories per day for the poor and 1,885 kilocalories for the very poor. \n5      The total fertility rate reduced from about 5 children to 3 children per woman in one decade.  \n6    Government of Bangladesh. Conceptual Framework for the Health, Nutrition, and Population Sector. Dhaka. \n7   The consortium is led by the World Bank and includes the Canadian International Development Agency, the \nDepartment for International Development, the European Community, the German Technical Assistance, the \nNetherlands Government, the Swedish International Development Agency, the United Nations Populations Fund, \nthe United States Agency for International Development, and the World Health Organization. ADB participates in \ndiscussions but doesn\u2019t provide direct funding for the Health and Population Sector Program.  ", "2 \n4.  As stated in the conceptual framework, responsibility for urban PHC rests with LGD in \nthe Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development, and Cooperatives\u2014and the six CCs and \n250 municipalities. In practice, only the CCs and the larger municipalities offer public health \nservices.8 Many smaller municipalities lack capacity for managing health services and depend \non  MHFW.  Limited  availability  of  affordable  urban  PHC  has  caused  congestion  of  tertiary \nhospitals and lack of services for the urban poor. Many poor parents don\u2019t seek treatment or \nthey use shops to purchase whatever they can afford.  NGOs and three major external agencies \nhave funded urban PHC in the past decade. The NGO Service Delivery Project of the United \nStates Agency for International Development is supporting 41 directly selected NGOs, about \nhalf of them urban, to provide an essential services package (ESP) in their clinics. The Better \nHealth for Urban Poor Project of the Department for International Development supports NGO \nservices  and  reaches  the  \u201cfloating\u201d  poor  through  community  health  workers  (CHWs).  The \nUPHCP follows a different approach, in that the Government contracts NGOs to provide PHC.     \n \n5.  The Urban Primary Health Care Project. The UPHCP\u2019s main objective has been to \nimprove  health  of  the  urban  poor,  especially  women  and  children.  Its  components  are  (i) \nproviding  PHC  through  partnership  agreements  (PAs),  (ii)  strengthening  urban  PHC \ninfrastructure, (iii) building capacity of CCs, and (iv) supporting project implementation and \nrelevant research. The main component and innovation has been to use government funds to \ncontract NGOs, through PAs, to provide ESPs for the poor in defined catchment populations of \nabout 300,000 people. Each NGO was allowed to develop its own system to achieve the \ntargets. In most cases, a four-tier system has emerged, with a comprehensive reproductive \nhealth care center, PHC centers (each services about 50,000 people), satellite clinics, and \nCHWs. The monitoring function has been partly contracted out to an independent firm, which \nalso conducts baseline and follow-up surveys to assess NGO performance. NGOs were to be \npaid according to their performance, with an additional bonus of up to 6% of the contract \namount depending on the health impact in the catchment population.    \n \n6.  Project implementation was initially delayed due to the policy issues that needed to be \nresolved to allow LGD to take this new role in urban areas, and to the time needed to design \nand implement a competitive and transparent bidding process and provide infrastructure. Of 16 \nPAs, 10 are in Dhaka, 3 in Chittagong, 2 in Khulna, and 1 in Rajshahi. Two PAs in Chittagong \nfollow another approach, in that the Chittagong CC is the implementing agency rather than an \nNGO.  Because  of  the  delay,  the  project  closing  date  was  extended  by  18  months  to  31 \nDecember 2004. About $10.4 million of the original loan amount was canceled due to savings \non NGO contracts, medical supplies, and construction, and additional funding from the United \nNations Populations Fund and national programs for priority diseases.    \n \n7.  Many lessons have been learned. Regarding scope, the flexible system design resulted \nin a clinic-oriented approach: NGOs are not automatically focusing on the system that will give \nmaximum overall impact, and targets are mortality-oriented. NGO services are mainly focused \non women, and less so on children and men, reflecting the background of the NGOs. More \nfocus is needed on community activities: only a few, sometimes overqualified CHWs were \ndeployed. In addition, children will not benefit much unless the environmental conditions are \nimproved.    \n \n8.  LGD developed a cost-based NGO financing system, reimbursing NGOs each quarter \nfor  actual  expenditures  according  to  agreed  prices  and  contract  ceilings.  The  experience                        \n                                                 \n8   The population of the 6 city corporations (CCs) is about 15 million, and of the 20 largest municipalities about 3 \nmillion.  ", "    3 \nshowed that a performance-based system is difficult to link with NGO effort, as many people \noutside the catchment area use the services, the environmental conditions undermine impact on \nchild health, and performance is difficult to measure in time. The competitive bidding process, \nwithout adequate standardization, created a situation where the NGO budget was too low. \nAnother important challenge was to make services affordable for the poor. The very poor are \ngiven free services using a color-coded card. For the non-poor,9 NGOs are recovering about \n20\u201350% of their costs through user fees. While this does not provide a financial incentive for the \nNGOs,  as  this  amount  is  deducted  from  the  total  amount  reimbursed  to  NGOs,  it  helps \novercome the occasional cash flow problems. Another challenge is to sustain services after \nexternal funding stops. Currently, CCs target only 1% of their budget for health services. \n \n9.  Despite the initial delays, the UPHCP has been highly successful in providing critical \nmaternal care and family planning services of good quality (including Caesarian sections), and \nin reducing maternal mortality. Client visits have increased rapidly from 300,000 in 2001 to over \na million in 2002. A large number of people have been reached through outreach services. CCs, \nNGOs, and beneficiaries are pleased with the services.  \n \n10.  Proposal for a New Project. Current services clearly demonstrate that public-private \npartnership has been successful in delivering affordable quality ESP to the urban poor. It is \nimportant to explore the possibility of making this model fully sustainable by strengthening \nmanagement  and  financing  capacity  in  CCs,  and  expanding  it  to  municipalities.  Such \nstrengthening and expansion would need to be firmly rooted in the policy framework of the \nGovernment\u2019s HNPSP.  \n \n11.  The Government, NGOs, and beneficiaries want to improve the current approach and \nexplore whether it can be used in municipalities. A first component will support PAs: the 4 \ncurrent CCs would be phased out, with CCs taking over financing services for the poor, and \nnon-poor services being managed through cost recovery or prepaid arrangements. Two new \nCCs (Sylhet and Barisal) and a number of municipalities could be added, resulting in a modest \nincrease of the catchment population. CHWs may be added to reach the very poor. More \nemphasis  is  needed  on  nutrition  interventions,  child  care,  and  male  health  promotion.  An \nimproved bidding process will allow hiring more qualified staff and better incentives. The second \ncomponent  will  improve  infrastructure  and  environmental  conditions  in  slums  and  health \nservices. The third component will strengthen capacities and linkages of LGD, MHFW, CCs, and \nlarge municipalities; along with monitoring, evaluation, and operations research. The Project is \nlikely to be implemented through LGD, CCs, and selected municipalities, strengthened for this \npurpose and for sustaining health services.    \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n12.  The purpose of the TA is to evaluate the current UPHCP and design a follow-up project \nthat will extend and improve the health, nutrition, and population status of the urban poor, \nparticularly women and children, by ensuring that they have access to high-quality, affordable, \nand sustainable PHC services. The TA will also plan to strengthen the capacity and linkages of \nLGD, MHFW, CCs, municipalities, and related institutions.          \n   \n \n                                                 \n9  The targeting of the poor and affordability of services need to be examined. ", "4 \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n13.  The TA will consist of a situation analysis of the urban health sector, and preparation of \na project proposal following a bottom-up, participatory approach. The situation analysis will \ninclude review of (i) the UPHCP and other health projects; (ii) the policy, governance, and \nfinancing environment; and (iii) living conditions that affect health and nutrition.  \n \n14.  The TA will review (i) the sector policy framework, and governance and financing plans; \n(ii) institutional capacity, linkages, and coordination; and (iii) NGO capacity building needs, \nmonitoring, and supervision, in particular for improving staff incentives, quality of services, and \naccess to the very poor. Second, the TA will help develop the project scope, including (i) the \nfour-tier system, ESP, and expansion into nutrition and water and sanitation interventions; (ii) \nimproved benefits to children; (iii) male health issues; (iv) environmental improvement; and (v) \nmore  convenient  and  better  quality  services  and  referral.  Third,  the  TA  will  help  examine \nsources and uses of funds for urban PHC, to determine potential for realigning PHC financing \nand expenditures. This will include examination of CC capacity to finance urban PHC services. \nThe TA will include a cost analysis of contracting modalities. The TA will help examine the \naffordability of health services, and will propose cost recovery and pricing improvements. The \nconsultants will examine the cost of improving the quality of services, through variations in staff, \nincentives, and  quality  control  measures.  Fourth,  the  TA  will  include  a  poverty  and  social \nanalysis of the conditions in urban slums. This will include an assessment of alternative options \nto improve benefits to the very poor, the process for selecting CHWs, and the potential for \norganizing communities to solve environmental problems. It will also assess whether the Project \nwill affect any ethnic minorities with special needs, and whether there are resettlement issues. \nCost recovery schemes and social access to health facilities, including those related to location \nand design of facilities, will also be examined. Fifth, the TA will help review physical planning, \nland acquisition, and facility design in the UPHCP. It will help identify priority populations and \nlocations  for  expanding  services  based  on  need,  service  gaps,  and  commitment  of  local \ngovernments to expand services for the poor. It will include a review of alternative options for \nthe provision of facilities and improving the environmental conditions.  \n \n15.  Based on the foregoing analysis, the TA will develop (i) a detailed description of a 5 year \ninvestment project; (ii) policy action to improve and sustain the efficiency and effectiveness of \nthe UPHCP model through public-private partnership; (iii) mechanisms for strengthening the \ncapacity of the CCs in planning, financing, supervising, monitoring, and evaluating of PHC \nprograms;  (iv)  estimates  of  capital  and  recurrent  expenditures;  and  (v)  implementation \narrangements and schedules, a project performance management system, and a draft project \n         \nimplementation manual.       \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $500,000 equivalent, comprising $230,000 in \nforeign  exchange  cost  and  $270,000  equivalent  in  local  currency  cost.  ADB  will  provide \n$400,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost and $170,000 equivalent of the \nlocal currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded \nby the Government of Japan. The Government will finance the remaining $100,000 equivalent \nof  local  currency  cost,  through  in-kind  contributions  including  counterpart  staff,  field  visits, \nworkshops, and office accommodation and utilities. The cost and financing plan are in Appendix \n3. The Government has been advised that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance \nany ensuing project.  \n ", "    5 \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  LGD will be the Executing Agency for the TA. A steering committee will be established, \nto  be  chaired  by  the  secretary,  LGD,  and  including  representatives  of  MHFW,  Economic \nRelations  Department,  the  Planning  Commission,  CCs,  municipalities,  NGOs,  development \npartners, and civil society. The steering committee will guide and coordinate the TA through \nmonthly meetings. A project coordination unit (PCU) will be established in LGD. The PCU will be \nresponsible for coordinating the TA, including liaison with stakeholders; data collection and \nanalysis; support of consultants; provision of logistic support; and organization of workshops. \nThe PCU will comprise a full-time senior planning officer (head), two counterparts, and two \nassistants. The PCU will be supported by other planning officers of LGD and CCs on a part-time \nbasis. A participatory planning process will be followed, starting from the community level and \nNGO partners to formulate the initial proposal.           \n \n18.  A total of 21 person-months of consulting services will be made available. The two \ninternational  consultants  will  include  a  team  leader  and  expert  in  health  planning  and \nmanagement (4 person-months), and governance expert (3 person-months). The five national \nconsultants will include a health economist (4 person-months), a sociologist (2 person-months), \na nutrition specialist (2 person-months), a capacity building expert (3 person-months), and an \ninfrastructure planner (3 person-months). All consultants will be selected and engaged through \na  firm,  following  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants,  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory  to  ADB  on  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  The  simplified  technical \nproposal format and the quality and cost-based selection method will be used. The indicative \nterms of reference are in Appendix 4. An observer from the Government will be invited to Manila \nfor contract negotiations. Minor equipment and office supplies, including computers, printer, \nfacsimile  machine,  photocopy  machine,  software  and  Internet  connection,  furniture,  and \nairconditioners  will  be  procured  under  the  TA  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement. All equipment purchased under the TA will be handed over to the Government \nafter TA completion.  \n19.  Within 2 weeks of the start of the TA, the PCU will submit an inception report discussing \nthe methodology of the TA and initial findings. The sector analysis will be submitted within 2 \nmonths after the start of the TA, followed by a draft final report 2 weeks before completion of the \nTA, and the final report within 2 weeks after completion of the TA, for approval of the LGD and  \nADB. The TA will start in October 2003 and will be completed by April 2004.    \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n20.    The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Bangladesh for preparing the Second Urban Primary Health Care Project, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board.
