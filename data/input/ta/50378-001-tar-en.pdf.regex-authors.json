INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Fiji recognizes that strong public financial management (PFM) is key \nto  macroeconomic  stability  and  poverty  reduction.  The  knowledge  and  support  technical \nassistance  (TA)  will  support  the  implementation  of  Fiji\u2019s  Public  Financial  Management \nImprovement Programme (PFMIP) 2016\u20132019 by improving institutional capacity for reform and \nreform coordination.1 Implementing the PFMIP will help promote fiscal discipline, the strategic \nallocation of resources, and efficient service delivery. \n \n2.  The TA is included in the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country operations business \nplan for Fiji, 2017\u20132019,2 and is aligned to the National Development Plan 2017\u22122036,3 which \nfocuses  on  improving  public  sector  efficiency  and  incentivizing  more  efficient  allocation  of \nresources  to  enhance  good  governance  and  support  sustainable  growth  in  key  economic \nsectors.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Development context. Fiji is one of the more developed Pacific island countries, but \nfaces significant challenges related to the country\u2019s small size and remote location. Fiji\u2019s economy \nhas outperformed those of most other Pacific islands countries in 2014\u20132016, with steady growth \nsince FY2010, longer than any period since independence in 1970. However, this expansion is \nlargely  driven  by  the  public  sector,  with  private  investment  discouraged  by  Fiji\u2019s  high-cost \nbusiness and investment environment.5 Moreover, Fiji\u2019s vulnerability to natural disasters such as \ncyclones and floods has contributed to volatility in growth. Growth in FY2016 fell to .4% following \nextensive damage caused by Cyclone Winston, a reduction from 4.7% during FY2013\u2013FY2015. \nIn FY2017 post-cyclone reconstruction combined with large public infrastructure investments to \ndrive growth resulted in government debt increasing to an estimated 45.5% of gross domestic \nproduct (GDP), with budget deficits rising to 7.4%. Fiji\u2019s debt is expected to rise further to 47.3% \nof GDP in FY2018, which is close to the limit of the government\u2019s public debt ceiling of 50% of \nGDP;6 this leaves limited fiscal space to further stimulate growth and respond to shocks such as \nnatural disasters. In response the government has adopted a medium-term fiscal adjustment \nprogram based on maintaining the budget deficit at less than 3.0% of GDP and reducing the debt \nstock to 40% of GDP (footnote 6). \n \n4.  Reform agenda. The government recognizes that achieving a sound fiscal position \nrequires sound policies, systems, and processes. A strong PFM system is regarded as vital to \nmacroeconomic stability, and is a key ingredient for sustained growth and poverty reduction. A \npublic expenditure and financial accountability (PEFA) assessment undertaken in 2013 (footnote \n1) provided the government an opportunity to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of Fiji\u2019s \nPFM system. The PEFA identified improvements that had taken place in 2010\u20132013, and also \nhighlighted  several  weaknesses  and  challenges.  On  the  basis  of  the  PEFA  findings,  the \ngovernment developed and adopted the PFMIP, which outlines a time-bound action plan to \n                                                \n1  Government of Fiji. 2013.

Implementing  the  Public  Financial  Management  Improvement  Programme. \nImplementation of the PFMIP is central to the government\u2019s efforts to achieve a strong PFM \nsystem. Steady progress is being made and recent PFM improvements include (i) simplification \nof tax laws, systems, and processes through amendments to the Income Tax Act; (ii) introduction \nof  pay-as-you-earn  as  a  final  tax  and  value-added  tax  self-assessment;  (iii)  inclusion  of \nperformance management in budget documents at the program and activity level, and tracking of \nthe implications of new policy decisions; (iv) submission of annual procurement plans and their \npublication  on  the  Ministry  of  Economy  (MOE)  website;  (v)  amendment  of  procurement \nregulations to tighten the conditions for the waiver of competitive bids; and (vi) development of a \ndebt management strategy and processes for evaluation of guarantees and onlending. However, \nthe government recognizes that additional reforms are essential, and that the pace of reform must \nbe accelerated to create the required fiscal space. \n \n6.  Major  reforms  prioritized for  implementation  during  2018\u20132020  include  (i)  improving \noverall budget reliability by strengthening the recording and monitoring of expenditure arrears; (ii) \nconducting public expenditure reviews of the education and health sectors; (iii) improving the link \nbetween  policy  priorities  and  resource  allocation  through  the  incorporation  of  multiyear \nperspectives  in  fiscal  planning,  expenditure  policy,  and  budgeting;  and  (iv)  improving  the \ncompleteness and timeliness of accounts reconciliation, including payroll and advance accounts. \n \n7.  The MOE has identified three major factors critical to accelerating the implementation of \nhigh-priority reforms: \n(i)  Improving the institutional capacity for reform. Fiji\u2019s small population and \ncontinued high migration rate have contributed to a shortage of qualified staff, and \nsubsequent weak institutional capacity for reform. A PFM capacity development \nprogram, prepared as part of the PFMIP,7 has identified and prioritized the need to \naddress the following skills gaps: \n(a)  technical  skills,  through  training  in  basic  procurement,  public  policy \nanalysis, budget analysis, revenue forecasting, debt analysis, and cash \nflow management; \n(b)  management  skills,  through  training  in  basic  management  functions, \ndelegation and time management, handling of difficult conversations, and \nnegotiations; and \n(c)  leadership  skills,  through  training  in  leadership,  motivating  staff,  and \nmanaging the political economy. \n(ii)  Improving reform coordination within and outside the government. There is \nno  government-led  PFM  reform  coordination  mechanism.  The  internal  PFM \nReform Steering Committee (led by the MOE) is largely inactive because of high \nturnover of experienced staff within the MOE, poor transition arrangements and \nhandover  practices,  and  overstretched  management  capacity.  In  addition, \nalthough PFM TA is being provided by the Government of Australia, ADB, the \nPacific Financial Technical Assistance Center, and the World Bank, TA needs are \ndiscussed on a bilateral basis, with limited information sharing. \n(iii)  Restructuring  the  Ministry  of  Economy  to  improve  provision  of  core \nfunctions. Coordination and collaboration within and across MOE divisions and \nunits  can  be  strengthened  to  improve  MOE  service  delivery  and  overall \n                                                \n7  Government of Fiji. 2016.

The professional cadre\u2014comprising qualified \naccountants, auditors, and economists\u2014makes up about 25% of the workforce, \nand most of the middle and senior management positions. Working closely with \nthe government\u2019s Civil Service Reform Unit,8 the MOE undertook internal reviews \nof its units and divisions to determine whether a new structure was needed to \nimprove  service  delivery  efficiency  and  effectiveness.  A  new  structure  was \nsubsequently approved (in August 2017) that improves the alignment between the \npolicy and operating environments, and up to 70% of all positions have now been \nfilled. \n \n8.  ADB support. The ADB TA will support recruitment of international and national experts \nin fiscal policy, budget management, financial management, public procurement, and knowledge \nmanagement to help the MOE address the factors identified above, and thereby improve its \ninstitutional capacity to implement the PFMIP and strengthen reform coordination. In so doing, \nthe TA will also support the implementation of potential elements of subprogram 2 of a planned \n$180 million programmatic policy-based loan operation. Likely areas of support to be reflected in \nthe subprogram include public expenditure reviews, monitoring and recording of expenditure \narrears, debt management, and budget strengthening. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The  TA  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  inclusive  socioeconomic  development \n(footnote 3). The TA will have the following outcome: PFM improved.9 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n10.  The outputs of the TA will be (i) institutional capacity to implement the PFMIP improved, \nand  (ii)  reform  coordination  between  government  agencies  and  development  partners \nstrengthened. To achieve the outputs, the TA will establish and fund a PFM reform coordination \nunit (RCU) comprising four consultants (three international and one national) and three dedicated \nMOE counterpart staff as local reform champions. The RCU will report to the permanent secretary \nfor economy (PSE), and be led by a credible and experienced international consultant (advisor to \nthe PSE and team leader). The team leader will supervise the other international consultants \n(RCU advisors) and the national consultant, manage daily liaisons between the PSE and the RCU, \nadvise on human resources development and process improvements, and provide regular reports \nto the PFM Reform Steering Committee on the status of reform implementation. \n \n11.  Output 1: Institutional capacity to implement the Public Financial Management \nImprovement Programme improved. Under the overall oversight of the PSE, the RCU will \nsupport  implementation  of  the  PFMIP  through  ongoing  mentoring,  capacity  building,  and \ninteractive training of counterpart staff. The RCU will help formulate a clear operational work plan \nand change-management strategy, and monitor their implementation in support of the PFMIP \nstrategic outcomes and priorities (e.g., public expenditure reviews for health and education, and \nthe adoption of a medium-term expenditure framework). The RCU will provide at least eight \n                                                \n8  The Civil Service Reform Unit was set up to increase the efficiency, professionalism, and accountability of the Fijian \npublic service. The Government of Australia and the World Bank are working closely with the unit to support the \ngovernment\u2019s civil service reform agenda. \n9  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "4 \nstructured training sessions per year for government staff on relevant topics to be identified in \nconsultation with the PSE. The RCU will also provide regular briefings for decision makers through \nseminars and interactive training support for policy formulation and data analysis; support the \nproduction of PFM updates; and produce regular, user-friendly, knowledge briefs and videos and \nanalytical pieces. \n \n12.  The team leader will advise the PSE on all matters related to PFM reform. The RCU \nadvisors will work with the departments responsible for budgeting and planning; fiscal policy, \nresearch and analysis; and financial policy and accounting services . The RCU will advise the \nheads of these departments on the implementation of high-priority reforms (paragraph 6), and \nsupport  the  implementation  of  subprogram  2  reform  actions  (paragraph  8).  The  national \nconsultant will work closely with the team leader and RCU advisors and across all functional areas \nto produce user-friendly knowledge materials and short videos. \n \n13.  Output 2: Reform coordination between government agencies and development \npartners strengthened. The team leader will liaise with development partners and external \nagencies on PFMIP implementation to ensure reform efforts are coordinated, complementary and \naligned with the PFMIP. The PFM Reform Steering Committee will be reactivated to strengthen \ninternal coordination. The RCU will support the MOE\u2019s efforts to improve line ministry awareness \nof the PFMIP and the government\u2019s broader fiscal strategies and policies. \n \n14.  The TA will support the MOE in establishing a government-led PFM reform coordination \nmechanism to improve coordination with key partners that support PFM reforms (e.g., the \nGovernment of Australia, ADB, the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Center, and the World \nBank). With support from the RCU, the MOE will strengthen coordination to ensure that PFM \nreform efforts achieve timely results, while avoiding duplicative or contradictory advice from \ndevelopment partners. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $825,000, of which $750,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The key expenditure items \nare  listed  in  Appendix  2.  The  government  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of \ncounterpart  staff,  office  accommodation,  office  supplies,  secretarial  assistance,  domestic \ntransportation, and other in-kind contributions. The TA will also act to improve development \npartner coordination through cofinancing and joint analytical work. In this respect, additional \ndevelopment partner financing is expected during TA implementation. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  ADB will administer the TA. The MOE will be the executing and implementing agency. \nConsultant recruitment will be managed by ADB but the consultants will report to the PSE. The \nconsultants will operate as the RCU under the supervision of the team leader, who will be the \nliaison point with the PSE. Procurement of goods and services are envisaged for various activities \nsuch as training, seminars and conferences. Procurement will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Policy \n(2017, as amended from time to time) and the Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, \nas amended from time to time). \n ", "5 \n \nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  January 2018\u2013January 2020 \nExecuting agency  Ministry of Economy \nImplementing agency  Ministry of Economy \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \nAdvisor to the  12 person-months  $216,000 \npermanent secretary \nfor economy \nBudget management  10 person-months  $180,000 \nspecialist \nFinancial management  8 person-months  $144,000 \nspecialist \n  Publication and video  6 person-months  $60,000 \nproduction specialist \nAdvance contracting  All contracts \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n17.
