They  include \nagricultural  lessees  and  share  tenants;  regular  farm  workers; \nseasonal  farm  workers;  other  farm  workers;  actual  tillers  or \noccupants  of  public  lands;  collectives  or  cooperatives  of  the \nabove beneficiaries; and others directly working on the lands that \nare under acquisition by the Government under CARP.  \n \n ", "   \n \nagrarian reform  \u2013  A barangay or a cluster of barangays in which a critical mass of \ncommunity   the population consists of ARBs. Further, to be designated as an \nagrarian reform community (ARC) by the Department of Agrarian \nReform (DAR), the barangay or cluster of barangays in question \nis required to fulfill certain criteria. These include, among others, \nthat (i) at least 50% of the population should consist of ARB \nhouseholds; (ii) cooperatives of the ARBs should have achieved a \nlevel of maturity in management, which is measured by DAR\u2018s \nassessment  of  the  level  of  development  of  ARCs,  (iii)  the \ncommunity exhibits a willingness to adopt improved production \nand management practices; and (iv) at least 75% of the CARP \nscope for LAD is completed.  \n \nThe ARC concept emerged in 1993. It is central to DAR\u2019s attempt \nto showcase that agrarian reform works to empower people and \nbring about sustainable agro-industrial development. This is to be \ndone  through  a  holistic  implementation  of  land  reform \naccompanied  by  other  support  services  that  can  bring  about \nsustained improvements in the quality of lives of ARBs. The ARC \nconcept also implies geographic convergence of all government \nand nongovernment agencies\u2019 support services for maximizing \nefficiency and impacts of rural development efforts. \n \nARC cluster  \u2013  The term means an area consisting of 2 or more ARCs including \nthe non\u2013ARC barangays in the designated area and/or cluster. \nThe term that has been variously adopted by DAR since 2006 as \na concept that allows inclusion of non-ARB populations within and \noutside ARCs, as well as ARBs living in non-ARC barangays in \nthe vicinity of designated ARCs within DAR\u2019s programs and plans. \nThe  ARC  cluster  approach  is  thus  expected  to  help  the \nGovernment  to  reach  larger  populations  than  those  of  the \nselected ARCs alone, to increase marketable surplus production, \napply  the  agribusiness  concept  to  large  areas  of  agricultural \nlands, and achieve economies of scale. \n \nARC connectivity  \u2013  This term implies establishment of physical and other types of \nconnectivity between ARCs and non-ARC areas covered under \nthe  ARC  cluster  concept.  Through  improved  connectivity, \neconomies  of  scale  may  be  achieved  in  terms  of  volumes  of \nproduce  being  transported  to  markets;  increases  in  commuter \ntraffic;  and  greater  efficiencies  in  markets,  investments,  and \nservices. \n \nbarangay  \u2013  Tagalog  term  for  the  smallest  local  government  unit  in  the \nPhilippines;  it  represents  a  village.  Municipalities  or  cities  are \ncomposed  of  barangays.    In  cities,  congressional  districts  are \ncomposed of clusters of barangays.  In provinces, congressional \ndistricts are composed of a cluster of municipalities. \n \n \n \n ", " \ncommunity\u2013 \u2013  Treats poor people and their institutions as assets and partners in \ndriven  the search for sustainable solutions to development challenges. \ndevelopment  Community\u2013driven  development  \u2013\u2013  broadly  defined  \u2014  is  an \napproach  that  gives  control  over  planning  decisions  and \ninvestment  resources  to  community  groups  and  local \ngovernments.

It \nwill provide holistic support to CARP by facilitating the access of target \ncommunities to essential support services and markets, in approximately \n152 target agrarian reform communities (ARCs) and 11 ARC clusters in 19 \nof the poorest provinces of southern Philippines. It will help facilitate their \ntransformation  from  subsistence  producers  toward  agribusiness \ndevelopment. It will include both agrarian reform beneficiaries (ARBs) and \nother segments of the rural poor in ARCs and ARC clusters in target \nmunicipalities.  The  Project  will  adopt  community\u2013driven  development \nstrategies to reach out to large segments of the rural poor in the target \nareas to strengthen their social capital. It aims to (i) substantially expand \nthe rural production base by assisting the rural poor in the target areas to \nbreak out of subsistence production, diversify their livelihood activities, and \nincrease  their  marketable  surplus;  (ii)  raise  production  and  distribution \nefficiency  in  project  areas  to  improve  quality  and  competitiveness;  (iii) \nimprove the position of small farmers vis-\u00e0-vis the larger markets; (iv) \nimprove employment opportunities for landless households in the target \nareas; and (v) promote equitable distribution of production and productivity \ngains among all segments of the rural poor in the target areas.  \n \nThe  Project  will  use  a  community\u2013driven  development  approach  in  all \ntarget  ARCs  and  ARC  clusters  to  strengthen  social  capital  formation, \nincrease the effective participation of the rural poor in community planning \nand implementation, and facilitate the formation of socially homogenous \ngroups for community-based financial services. It will support participatory \nARC  planning,  strengthen  community  involvement  in  prioritization  of \nproject  interventions,  implement  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB) \nsafeguard  policies,  and  improve  local  governance  among  ARC \norganizations and local government agencies, among others. Commercial \nactivities among rural communities will be supported through productivity \nimprovements,  agri-enterprise  development,  market  promotion, \nstrengthening  of  farmer  organizations,  security  of  land  tenure,  and \nsustainable rural financial services. Rural infrastructure development will \nbe supported to enhance ARC connectivity and to develop agri-business \nareas.  Project  management  will  be  mainstreamed  at  all  levels  in \naccordance with the Government\u2019s priorities. \n ", "ii   \n \n   \nRationale  Most  of  the  rural  poor  in  the  Philippines  are  landless  and  land-poor \nhouseholds inhabiting rural areas in southern Luzon, Mindanao, and the \nVisayas.  Their  lack  of  equitable  access  to  the  means  of  production, \nincluding  land,  capital,  irrigation,  technology,  information,  employment \nopportunities, and markets, leads to deep poverty and low living standards. \nThe Government\u2019s response to the widespread rural distress and unrest in \nthe 1980s has been the CARP. CARP aims to acquire and redistribute all \npublic  and  disposable  alienable  land  suited  to  agriculture,  as  well  as \nprivate agricultural lands above certain limits, irrespective of crops grown, \nto eligible ARBs. CARP includes support services to be provided to ARBs \nwith a view to reducing their poverty and improving the sustainability of \ntheir  landholdings.  ADB  has  supported  the  implementation  of  CARP \nthrough its Agrarian Reform Communities Project (ARCP).  \n \nUnder the ARCP, ADB assisted the development coverage of 165 ARCs in \n35 provinces. The ARCP has been successful in achieving most of its \ntargets with high rates of utilization of project financing. Targets for most of \nthe components have been exceeded, especially for rural infrastructure, \nwhich  has  had  far-reaching  effects  on  the  access  of  target  ARCs  to \nprocessing facilities and bigger markets. Technology transfer for improving \nproductivity and rural enterprise development has shown results in terms \nof sustainable increases in incomes for ARBs and other farmers. The \nARCP has demonstrated the need for ensuring regular budgetary releases \nfor project implementation. It has also brought home to both ADB and the \nGovernment  the  need  for  mainstreaming  project  management  and  for \nensuring  high  standards  of  governance  and  fiduciary  responsibility  all \naround. \n \nBuilding  on  lessons  learned  from  the  ARCP,  as  well  as  the  lessons \nemerging from the impact assessments done for CARP (in 2003 and 2007) \nand other externally assisted projects, and in support of the priorities of the \nGovernment, the ARCP II will cover about 152 ARCs and 11 ARC clusters \n(target  ARCs  and  ARBs  and  other  farmers  in  adjacent  areas)  in  19 \nprovinces. It will provide targeted support in precisely those areas where it \nis  necessary  to  bring  about  fundamental  change  to  enable  the \ntransformation  of  CARP  lands  into  agribusiness  lands.  It  will  thus \ncontribute to pro-poor economic growth and lead to equitable sharing of \nthe benefits of growth across regions and rural poor communities. \n   \nImpact and  The long-term impact of the Project is to enable ARB households and \nOutcome  other segments of the rural poor in about 152 selected ARCs and 11 ARC \nclusters  in  19  provinces  to  reduce  their  poverty  and  have  sustained \nimprovements in their incomes and quality of life. The Project is expected \nto bring about long-lasting improvements in the capabilities and well-being \nof poor and marginalized groups in the target communities.  \n   \nProject  The project investment cost is at $208.4 million, including taxes and duties \nInvestment  of $18.2 million. The base cost is allocated among four components: $5.3 \nPlan   million for community\u2013driven development; $25.2 million for agriculture and \n ", "iii \nenterprise development; $135.2 million for rural infrastructure; and $9.6 \nmillion for project management. Price and physical contingencies against \nanticipated negative impacts to the Project of inflation and extraordinary \nforeign exchange fluctuations within the project years are estimated at \n$21.7 million. Total financial charges for the loan from ADB ordinary capital \nresources amount to $10.4 million, and commitment charges $1.0 million. \n   \nFinancing Plan   \n  Financiers  $ million  Percentage \n  Asian Development Bank  70.0  33.6 \n  OPEC Fund for International Development  30.0  14.4 \n  Central Government  52.4  25.1 \n  Local Government Units  56.0  26.9 \n  Total    208.4  100.0 \n  OPEC = Organization of Petroleum Exporter Countries.   \nSources: Asian Development Bank and the Government estimates, 2008. \n \n  The Government has requested financial assistance of $100 million to help \n  implement the Project. About $70 million of such financing will come from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, while about $30 million will come from \nthe OPEC Fund for International Development (OFID) to be administered \nby ADB. The ADB ordinary capital resources portion of the loan will have a \n25-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate \ndetermined in accordance with the ADB LIBOR-based lending facility, plus \na 0.20% spread; the commitment charge is calculated at a 0.15% rate on \nthe un-disbursed loan balance; and such other terms and conditions set \nforth in the draft loan and project agreements. The OFID portion of the loan \nwill have a 20-year maturity, including a 5-year grace period, a 1% service \ncharge per annum, and 3% interest. \n   \nAllocation and  The Government will allocate about $65.9 million of the ADB and OFID \nRelending  loan proceeds to municipal governments for priority rural infrastructure as \nTerms  a  mix  of  loan  and  grant;  this  will  complement  equity  contributions  of \nmunicipalities  and  beneficiaries.  The  proportion  of  loan  and  grant  and \nterms of the loan will be in accordance with the national government and \nlocal government unit (LGU) cost-sharing policy. \n   \nPeriod of  Until 30 June 2015  \nUtilization \n   \nEstimated  31 December  2014  \nProject \nCompletion \nDate \n   \nImplementation  The  Project  will  be  fully  mainstreamed  within  existing  government \nArrangements  structures.  The  Department  of  Agrarian  Reform  (DAR)  will  be  the \nExecuting Agency. A project executive committee will be set up, to be \nchaired by the DAR secretary. A national project coordinator at the DAR \ncentral office will liaise, coordinate, and report on project implementation. \nAt regional and provincial levels, existing DAR offices will be implementing \n ", "iv   \n \nagencies with full responsibility for project implementation and supervision. \nAt  the  municipal  level,  LGUs  will  be  the  implementing  units,  in  close \ncollaboration with the Municipal Agrarian reform Officers (MAROs). They \nwill  set  up  local  project  offices  to  undertake  subproject  planning  and \nexecution. The farmer organizations in the ARCs will be key partners in \nproject  implementation.  In  addition,  the  CARP  partner  implementing \nagencies will enter into memorandums of agreement with DAR to provide \ntechnical support for implementation of the Project.  \n   \nExecuting  Department of Agrarian Reform  \nAgency \n   \nProcurement  All goods and related services financed under the ADB loan, as well as the \nADB-administered OFID loan, will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). \n   \nConsulting  An estimated 1,230 person-months of consulting services, comprising 30 \nServices  person-months of two international consultants and 1,200 person-months \nof  national  consulting  services  will  be  recruited  to  assist  the  national \ngovernment  agencies,  municipal  and  provincial  LGUs,  and  local \ncommunities in project implementation. Consultants will be recruited in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended from time to time).  This excludes consultancy contracts for \nactivity-specific services. \n   \nProject  The Project will target more than 150,000 persons in about 44,000 ARB \nBenefits and  and  non-ARB  households  in  the  target  areas  in  19 provinces.  These \nBeneficiaries  include  large  numbers  of  the  poor  and  vulnerable  segments  of  the \npopulation. At least one third of the target population will be assisted to \nmove out of poverty. The Project will contribute to increasing cropping \nintensity  and  crop  yields  through  irrigation  development.  Reduction  in \ntransport  costs  resulting  from  better  access  to  infrastructure  will  be \naccompanied by better prices and greater value addition. Other benefits \nwill include stronger and more representative farmer organizations in target \nARCs and ARC clusters. The poor and vulnerable segments in target \nARCs, particularly women, will be empowered through social inclusion and \nthrough the provision of potable water to target ARCs.  \n \nThe  poverty  impact  assessment  shows  that  landless  households  are \nexpected to gain in terms of additional employment availability. The Project \nis expected to provide an additional 5 million person-days of unskilled labor \nand 2 million person-days of skilled labor in target ARCs and ARC clusters, \nbenefiting  landless  and  other  rural  poor  households.  With  a  prevalent \naverage rural poverty rate of 49%, and much higher rates in many project \nareas, the Project is expected to facilitate sustainable poverty reduction, \nwith households achieving steady income increases above existing levels. \nNon-income poverty will be reduced by improving the access of the poor to \nvarious  kinds  of  capital  and  assets,  including  social,  physical,  natural, \nfinancial, human, and informational.  \n   \n   \n ", "v \nRisks and  Risks  to  the  Project  arise  from  peace  and  security-related  concerns \nAssumptions  especially in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM). Other \nrisks pertain to corruption and weak governance. The high levels of equity \ncontribution required of relatively poorer LGUs can become a potential \nproblem for the Project in reaching out to extremely poor areas. Several \nLGUs  are  weak  with  regard  to  project  management\u2014financial \nmanagement  in  particular.  The  Project  is  expected  to  contribute  to \nreducing  conflict  and  improving  peace  and  security  through  social \ninclusion, and by working together with traditional community leaderships, \nparticularly in ARMM. Improving livelihoods will further help to improve \nliving standards and reduce conflict. Corruption will be reduced with close \nmonitoring  by  the  Executing  Agency  of  financial  management  of  the \nProject by weak LGUs, especially in ARMM. Capacity development of such \nLGUs  to  improve  financial  management  will  also  be  provided  by  the \nProject. The 50% equity requirement of poorer LGUs will be dealt with by \nthe provision of a refund to them of up to 20% of their equity upon their \ncompletion of agreed institutional reforms. Risks will also be managed by \ncontinued  attention  to  timely  resource  availability  and  capacity \ndevelopment of stakeholders at the national, LGU, and community levels. \nRegular  budget  releases  will  reduce  risks  of  delays  in  project \nimplementation. \n   \n \n ", "119 o 00'E 125 o 00'E\nBabuyan  Channel\n122o  00'E\nPHILIPPINES\n21o  00'N 21o  00'N\nAGRARIAN REFORM\nILOCOS NORTE\nBATANES COMMUNITIES PROJECT II\nAPAYAO\nCAGAYAN\n122o  00'E REGION I\nIlocos KALINGA REGION II\nABRA CAR Cagayan Valley\nILOCOS SUR\nMT.

RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n1.  Dynamics of Rural Poverty in the Philippines \n2.  Poverty in the Philippines is primarily rural. Rural society is characterized by a highly \ninequitable land ownership structure, lack of security of access to land and other means of \nproduction,  and  imperfect  factor  and  product  markets.  Levels  of  economic  inequality  are \nstrikingly high. Inequality in land distribution in the Philippines is much higher than in other parts \nof Southeast Asia. Prior to the initiation of land reforms in the Philippines, almost 50% of the \nrural population was landless. Land ownership was concentrated in the hands of the rural elite. \nIn 1971, almost 52% of land was owned by 15% of the population, consisting of the top \nlandowning families.2 Almost one third of the 30 million hectares (ha) of land area in the country \nis deemed agricultural land. Ownership of most of these lands is monopolized by elite families, \nalthough  only  one  third  is  officially  reported  as  privately  owned  at  the  start  of  the \nComprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP). The Gini coefficient of land ownership in \n1988 was 0.64.3 The lack of control over land has been one of the most persistent causes of \npoverty in the Philippines. By 2004, at least two out of every five Filipinos were poor.4 Despite \nsome economic improvements in recent times, the Philippines still lags behind other countries in \nAsia with lower levels of gross domestic product (GDP) growth and investment per capita than \nfor the region as a whole.5 Although the incidence of poverty in the Philippines has decreased in \nrecent years, poverty still remains predominantly rural and fairly high, at the level of more than \none third of the population (2005). About 49% of rural families rate themselves as poor.6 Poverty \nis highest among landless and marginal farm families. \n \n3.  The  2004  country  poverty  analysis  for  the  Philippines7  estimated  that  the  poverty \nheadcount increased between 2000 and 2003 at a rate that was higher than between 1997 and \n2000, and that the sustained economic growth had not been pro-poor. Poverty is geographically \n                                                 \n1  The Project was prepared under project preparatory technical assistance Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2005. \nTechnical Assistance to the Philippines for Agrarian Reform Communities II.

Self-rated poverty levels \nwere 55% in the National Capital Region, 53% in the rest of Luzon, 70% in the Visayas, and 52% in Mindanao. \nDuring field work done by the loan fact-finding mission, higher poverty levels (50\u201380%) were self-reported in \nagrarian  reform  communities  (ARCs)  in  Camarines  Sur,  Camarines  Norte,  Negros  Occidental,  Zamboanga \nSibugay, and Maguindanao, among others. The poor reported incomes much lower than the poverty line. Landless \nlaboring households were in much worse condition than agrarian reform beneficiaries (ARBs). \n7  ADB. 2005.

Interestingly, some of these \nareas are also those with high levels of land concentration and inequality. Rural landlessness is \na good indicator for poverty and hunger. In the 1980s, landless farm workers, share tenants, \nand lessees made up about 5 million households that were eligible to be covered by land \nreform.  Even  today,  despite  the  implementation  of  CARP,  about  60%  of  its  intended \nbeneficiaries remain landless. In addition, the landless workers who are not the intended CARP \nbeneficiaries amount to about 13% of rural households.8 \n  \n4.  The  Gini  coefficient  of  agricultural  landholding  is  much  higher,  0.57  to  0.76  (in \ncomparison  with  provinces  with  less  skewed  landholding)  for  the  provinces  of  Negros \nOccidental, Bukidnon and Davao del Sur and Davao del Norte in Mindanao which have highly \nskewed landholding patterns.9 While the lack of employment opportunities in the rural areas as \nwell as population growth may well have contributed to the problem of poverty, there can be no \ndoubt that institutional and policy issues related to access to land have a critical bearing on \npoverty reduction. Balisacan10 states that the situation in the Negros provinces of Visayas, \nBukidnon, and Davao del Sur, Davao del Norte provinces of Mindanao, resembles that in Latin \nAmerican countries. Aside from inequitable land holding patterns, the El Nino phenomenon has \nexposed the poor in particular to the impacts of natural disasters. Drought and floods brought \nabout by El Nino in the first half of 2005 depressed agricultural growth, which was a meager 2%. \nFalling rice production contributed to slow agricultural growth and rice imports in 2005. A Social \nWeather Stations (SWS) survey in December 2005 on self-rated poverty and hunger indicated \nthat many Filipinos are suffering from hunger\u201449% rated themselves as impoverished and 17% \nas hungry. The 2008 unprecedented rise in the international price of rice caused widespread \nproblems in the Philippines, the world\u2019s largest rice importer.  While the Government, its donor \npartners, and civil society acted to reduce the adverse impact on the poor, 59% of households \nrated themselves as poor according to the SWS survey in July 2008.11 \n \n5.  The  Government  has  used  land  reform  as  a  major  policy  response  to  deal  with \npersistent  unrest  among  the  rural  poor  since  1935  and  rural  poverty  since  World  War  II. \nHowever, all these initiatives suffered from poor budgetary support, exclusion of the largest \nareas under plantations and export crop production. The greatest sources of inequality and \nconcentration of land and power thus remained untouched. The programs excluded the landless \nagricultural workers who were among the poorest in the rural areas, often even poorer than \ntenants. \n \n6.  In 1988, as the first systematic attempt to end inequity in land ownership to promote \nrural  development  and  agrarian  reform,  President  Aquino  enacted  Republic  Act  6657,  the \nComprehensive Agrarian Reform Law, which governs implementation of CARP. CARP was a \nbreak from all earlier attempts at land reform, and it has had far-reaching impacts on poverty \nreduction and rural economic growth. CARP was originally meant to be implemented in 10 \nyears,  ending  in  1998.  However,  because  of  landlord  resistance  and  budgetary  problems, \nCARP was not able to reach its targets of land acquisition and distribution. Therefore, it was \nextended until June 2008.12  \n \n7.  In addition to land reform, strategies adopted by the Government to spur growth in the \nrural economy and bring about sustainable poverty reduction include President\u2019s Arroyo\u2019s 10-\n                                                 \n8  Balisacan, A.M. 2007.

The  Government  has  also  enacted  further  legislation,  including  the  Agriculture  and \nFisheries Modernization Act (1997) to improve the competitiveness of agriculture, and the Local \nGovernment Code (1991) which seeks to devolve responsibility for frontline service delivery to \nlocal government units (LGUs). However, progress is constrained by (i) the low availability of \npublic expenditures for infrastructure, transport linkages, and market development, especially in \nrural areas, (ii) the lack of efficient input distribution networks, (iii) the slow pace of actual \ndevolution to LGUs, many of which lack effective capacity to undertake planning and delivery of \nservices to their constituents, and (iv) the lack of effective planning and implementation of rural \ndevelopment. \n \n8.  Another factor that contributes to the weak performance of the agricultural economy vis-\n\u00e0-vis poverty reduction relates to the lack of efficiency in allocation of public expenditures in \nagriculture. Historically the Philippine policy of food self-sufficiency has led to distortions in the \nallocation of public resources to rice and in the setting of tariff and nontariff barriers to imports.14 \nAside from the budgetary allocations for irrigation and production support, rice dominates public \nexpenditures  for  farm  machinery,  post-harvest  equipment,  research  and  development,  and \ntraining programs. The distortions in public resource allocation created further inequalities as \nthese targeted the better-endowed farmers with access to technical know-how of certified seed \nand irrigation. This has distorted incomes and raised rice prices for landless rural workers, small \nfarmers operating marginal plots, non-irrigated rice farmers, fisherfolk, upland dwellers, and the \nurban poor. Dawe15 reported that the per capita incomes of landless rural workers were 30% \nlower than those of rice farmers.  High rice prices in 2008 hurt these sections along with the \nurban poor. \n \n9.  At present, several challenges face the Government in relation to rural poverty reduction \nand agricultural growth stimulation. The issues of inequity in land ownership, distortions in the \nfactor and product markets, lack of allocative efficiencies in public resource management, high \ngovernment  debt  burden,  and  rural  unemployment  and  underemployment  continue  to \nperpetuate a relatively weak performance in agriculture. The challenges relate to improving \nsustainability of rural livelihoods16 by developing holistic approaches to improve the investment \ninto  equity,  increase  investments  in  rural  production,  and  generate  sufficient  employment \nopportunities to address the needs of the rural poor. The Government\u2019s job creation target is 1.5 \nmillion jobs per year. Achievements have been well below that.   \n \n \n \n                                                 \n13 The President\u2019s 10-Point Agenda for Growth outlines a strategy to link growth and job creation with poverty \nreduction, while emphasizing fiscal stability and governance. \n14 World Bank. 2007.

It puts people at the center of \ndevelopment and views them as operating in a context of vulnerability. It provides a useful framework to \nunderstand the multidimensional nature of poverty, as defined by people themselves, as well as to analyze their \nrelative access to various types of capital (financial, physical, human, natural, social, and information), and their \nrelative ability to combine and utilize these assets as individuals and households to ensure access to adequate \nsubsistence and well-being, including improvements in livelihoods without undermining the natural resource base. \nFor further details, refer to, among others, Chambers, R. and G.

Strategies for Sustainable Livelihoods and Equitable Growth \na.  History of Land Reforms in the Philippines \n10.  The Government enacted the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law in 1988 in response \nto the historical inequity of land ownership and distribution of productive assets in agriculture, as \nwell as the resultant rural unrest, which was widespread. Earlier attempts at land reform in the \nPhilippines beginning in 1935 were seriously flawed. They were inadequate and were never \nintended to change the existing inequitable distribution of land and power. In 1972, the Marcos \nregime\u2019s attempt to bring about land reform was compromised by the exclusion of all lands other \nthan rice and corn lands, high land retention limits for absentee landowners, and a difficult \nprocess of securing land rights for the poor. It excluded from the purview of land reforms those \nplantations  and  export-oriented  farms  precisely  where  there  was  high  concentration  of \nownership and operational holdings. The program\u2019s exclusion of sugar and coconut haciendas, \nwhere most of the poorest workers were to be found, limited its impact at the very outset. The \nprogram also concentrated on tenancy regulation and resettlement. As a result, it was limited in \nits  scope  and  outreach  to  the  poor.  Only  3.2%  of  its  target  beneficiaries  were  issued \nemancipation patents. The program excluded landless agricultural workers numbering about  \n3.4 million people, who were the poorest in the rural areas.17 \n \nb.  Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program \n11.  In 1988, the circumstances were ripe for another attempt at agrarian reform in the \ncountry.  Widespread  problems  of  poverty  and  inequality  of  land  distribution  resulted  in \ncontinued rural unrest. In 1988, the Government brought forward the Comprehensive Agrarian \nReform Law, which gave rise to CARP. CARP is fundamentally different from all earlier land \nreform programs in the following ways: (i) It includes within its purview all agricultural lands \nirrespective of the commodity being produced and the status of the tiller; (ii) It includes a \ncomprehensive approach to agrarian reform including a program of support to agrarian reform \nbeneficiaries (ARBs), especially the delivery of basic support services needed to transform the \nARBs into efficient market-oriented producers; (iii) It reduces the retention limits for former \nlandowners; (iv) It determines compensation to be paid to landowners based on just principles \nto be implemented by the Land Bank of the Philippines; and (v) It includes the principle that land \nawarded to the  beneficiaries is to be paid for by them to the Land Bank of the Philippines. \n \n12.  Under CARP, all landless farm workers were eligible to be considered as beneficiaries, \nprovided they were landless and willing to farm the lands. The goal for CARP was to cover \n8.06 million ha under its land acquisition and distribution program. The Department of Agrarian \nReform (DAR), which was set up by the Marcos regime under a separate piece of legislation as \nthe  lead  agency  for  land  reform,18  was  deemed  as  the  agency  to  implement  CARP.  The \nDepartment of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) was placed in charge of the land \nacquisition and distribution for public alienable and disposable lands, as well as forested lands. \nThe  implementation  of  CARP  was  to  be  completed  in  10  years  (1998);  however,  it  was \nimplemented according to the availability of funds and capacity of implementing agencies. \nDelays occurred because of the considerable resistance by landowners, lack of coordination \namong  concerned  agencies  (including  DENR,19  DAR,  LGUs,  and  courts),  and  the  legal \nchallenges  and  hurdles  posed  by  landlords.  With  the  implementation  of  the  program  still \nincomplete in 1998, CARP was extended by 10 years to June 2008. There are currently moves \n                                                 \n17  Balisacan, A.M. (2007) op cit. p.6\u20137 \n18 Republic Act 6389 (1971) rendered into law the Code of Agrarian Reforms of the Philippines. DAR was set up as \nthe self-contained department to undertake agrarian reform (Section 49). \n19 DENR is responsible for the distribution of about 3.7 million ha of public alienable and disposable lands to ARBs. It \nis responsible for the survey of lands it targets for distribution and for the inspection and verification of surveys to \nbe carried out by DAR on the privately owned and government-owned lands targeted for distribution.  \n ", "  5\nbeing made to extend the program to complete the land acquisition and distribution, as well as \nthe delivery of support services to ARBs already provided with land titles. \n \n13.  Important  aspects  of  the  program  remain  to  be  completed.  In  terms  of  overall \naccomplishment of the acquisition and distribution of all lands under CARP, by December 2006, \nDAR had distributed 6.7 million ha, or 82% of the overall target 8.06 million ha. Most of the \nlands included consist of settlement areas, landed estates, and other government-owned lands, \nwhich represent 45% of the entire scope for CARP. Land acquisition and distribution has been \nparticularly slow for the 1.5 million ha of private agricultural lands under compulsory acquisition. \nIn terms of public alienable and disposable lands, the accomplishment was 69% by December \n2006, due to delays in the conduct of surveys, reconstitution of land records, and resolution of \nland conflicts.20 Another important aspect relates to the areas already covered by CARP land \nacquisition and distribution. For a large part of such lands, DAR has issued collective certificates \nof land ownership award (CLOA), which means that work still remains to be done to demarcate \nand title individual title holders.  \n \n14.  With  regard  to  the  provision  of  basic  support  services  to  the  ARBs,  inadequate \nbudgetary  resources,  limited  technical  capacity,  and  weak  coordination  had  led  to  slow \ncoverage by 1993. As a result, the Government, through DAR, in 1993 launched the agrarian \nreform communities (ARCs) approach to beneficiary development. The approach concentrates \nthe provision of support services in selected areas and ensures convergence of services CARP \nimpact assessments in 2003 and 2007 indicated that the ARC concept has been useful in \nachieving poverty reduction targets. ARCs were targeted in areas with high poverty incidence. \nARCs did better reducing poverty than non-ARC areas. Income levels of ARBs in ARCs are \nhigher than those of non-ARBs as well as other ARBs living outside ARC barangays. The ARC \nconcept thus remains valid for poverty reduction. \n \n15.  By 2004, the Government had realized that while the ARC concept has helped it to \ntarget scarce resources to achieve maximum impacts, it is also a limiting concept when faced \nwith the enormity of the task of poverty alleviation in the countryside and spurring sustainable \ngrowth.21 It excludes ARBs who do not live in barangays designated as ARCs. It also excludes \nnon-ARB populations living in and outside of ARCs. DAR had established about 1,800 ARCs by \nDecember 2006. In line with the Government\u2019s MTPDP, and the target of identifying 2 million ha \nof agribusiness lands, DAR is now pursuing a more inclusive approach to rural development. In \na paradigmatic shift, it enlarged its client base from ARBs inside ARCs to include ARBs living in \nbarangays not designated as ARCs, as well as non-ARBs living inside ARCs and in the vicinity \nof the target ARCs. As a result, enlarged populations of ARBs and non-ARBs are included in \nplanning development strategies and interventions.22 This provides the basis for the ARC cluster \napproach23 to ARC connectivity. An ARC cluster is defined as an enlarged area covering a \nnumber of municipalities with a high density of ARBs. It would serve as a convergence area for \nassistance to ARCs and non-ARC barangays by multiple agencies and facilitate agribusiness \ndevelopment.  \n \n                                                 \n20 Balisacan, A.M.

Manila. \n22  The ARC concept applies only to barangays where more than 50% of the population consists of ARB households, \nwhere ARC organizations have achieved a certain level of maturity, and where land tenure improvements have \nbeen mostly completed. DAR assistance for support services has been limited to such ARCs until now. As a result, \nARBs living outside such designated ARCs lose out in terms of support services provided to ARCs. \n23 See glossary for an explanation of the ARC cluster concept. \n ", "6   \n3.  National Policies and Plans \n16.  The  MTPDP  (2004\u20132010),  which  is  anchored  in  the  President\u2019s  10-point  agenda,24 \nintends to pursue a more holistic approach to reducing poverty by (i) substantially expanding the \nproduction base and breaking out from subsistence agriculture to increase and diversify the \nmarketable surplus of the farm; (ii) raising production and distribution efficiency to improve \nquality,  competitiveness,  and  prices  of  agricultural  products;  and  (iii)  promoting  equitable \ndistribution  of  production  and  productivity  gains  complemented  by  good  governance  and \ninstitutional reforms.   \n \n17.  The program strategies laid out in the MTPDP involve the identification and prioritization \nof  prime  and  semi-prime  agrarian  reform  lands  and  adjacent  areas  for  agribusiness \ndevelopment and employment generation. The Government recently announced a program for \nsupport to agriculture-based export zones using prime agrarian lands. With respect to CARP, \nthese strategic measures are to be complemented by capacity development for ARBs and other \nsegments  of  the  rural  poor  in  the  ARCs  and  their  vicinity,  and  their  community-based \norganizations or cooperatives.  \n \n18.  DAR  is  pursuing  the  implementation  of  land  tenure  improvement  and  provision  of \nessential support services in the ARCs in line with the MTPDP\u2019s strategy to reduce poverty \nthrough  land  reform,  improved  land  use  and  management,  improved  access  to  essential \nservices, and preferential access to social services and support groups by vulnerable groups. \n \n4.  Decentralization  \n19.  The  enactment  of  the  Local  Government  Code  in  1991  triggered  the  devolution  of \nauthority  and  responsibilities  from  the  national  government  to  the  LGUs  for  developing, \nfinancing, and managing development programs and projects. However, many LGUs still lack \ncapacity to become effective service providers to their rural populations. In addition, there are \nweaknesses in governance that need to be addressed. These include weak revenue generation, \npoor tax collection, and lack of proper financial controls and accountability, among others.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Constraints and Opportunities  \n1.  CARP Impact Assessment \n20.  The  enactment  of  the  Comprehensive  Agrarian  Reform  legislation  was  the \nGovernment\u2019s key strategy for enhancing access to land by some 4 million farmers who are to \nbenefit from agrarian reform.25 Assessing the outcomes and impacts of CARP can provide \nsignificant inputs into policy-related decision-making. In 2003, an in-depth study was conducted \nof the effectiveness of CARP in meeting its goals and reducing poverty.26 In addition, a study of \nCARP\u2019s impact on poverty reduction was carried out in 2007.27 The results demonstrate the \ndifficulties in  trying  to  assess  the  impacts  of  a  program  as  large  and  complex  as  CARP. \nAttribution is problematic because households and communities respond to a multiplicity of \n                                                 \n24 The President\u2019s 10-point agenda for growth has the following areas of focus: (i) economic growth and job creation, \n(ii)  energy,  (iii)  social  justice  and  basic  needs,  (iv)  education  and  youth,  and  (v)  anticorruption  and  good \ngovernance. \n25 The critical mandates of CARP are the distribution of public and private lands to ARBs and the improvement of \ntheir socioeconomic status by providing support services and basic rural infrastructure. Through CARP, the \nGovernment adopted a holistic approach to addressing the main impediments to agrarian reform and development \nincluding (i) difficulties in land valuation and titling; (ii) lack of access of the rural poor to institutional credit, inputs, \nand marketing outlets; (iii) weak farmer organizations; (iv) lack of support services; and (v) rural infrastructure. \n26 Habito.

The CARP impact assessment in 2003, which was supported by \na number of agencies, covered the program implementation in the first 12 years. It addressed \nimpacts at the household, community, sector, and economy-wide levels. The 2007 study is \nfocused on assessing the overall impact of CARP in terms of achieving its aims and objectives, \nand areas which need further support and strengthening. \n \n21.  Studies  to  provide  more  contemporary  analysis  are  currently  ongoing,  aimed  at \nreexamining the earlier findings in light of new data. While the conclusive findings of these \nstudies  are  not  yet  available,  the  indicative  findings  show  that  wherever  CARP  has  been \nproperly implemented through ARCs, the program has strengthened the formation of social, \nphysical, and human capital, and developed the entrepreneurial capacities of the ARBs. Gains \ninclude greater ownership by farmers of their lands, improved tenure security through leasehold, \nand reduced share tenancy. There have been improvements in access to basic social services \nas a result of the ARC strategy. It also shows that more ARBs now belong to cooperatives than \never before. Sustainability of ARC organizations is a cause for concern, underscoring the need \nfor  ensuring  their  long-term  ability  to  plan  and  undertake  commercial  and  other  activities \nautonomously. Similarly, the need to expand the outreach of support services to the greater \nnumber of ARBs still not covered by the program has led to the ARC cluster approach. Rural \ninfrastructure availability to ARBs is found to have increased substantially, for example, a 30% \nincrease in irrigation service area for total rice area in ARCs and a 22% increase in non-ARC \nbarangays. However, it was also found that crop yields could be improved through better \ntechnology and extension support. Based on an analysis of more than 50 proxy indicators of \nwelfare, the study found that while per capita expenditures on welfare have increased both in \nARCs and non-ARC barangays, the ARC households have a higher per capita expenditure on \nwelfare. CARP has led to higher real per capita incomes; and compared to non-ARBs, ARBs \nare found to have higher incomes and lower poverty incidence. Poverty incidence declined \nsomewhat more in ARCs than in non-ARC barangays. About 70% of the total number of ARBs \nin  target  ARCs  covered  by  support  services  under  program  beneficiary  development,  the \nGovernment\u2019s  Agrarian  Reform  Fund,  and  foreign-funded  projects,  are  found  to  have  an \naverage annual income higher than the national poverty line. \n \n22.  The assessments also point out that merely being an ARB does not improve chances of \novercoming poverty. What matters is the length of time as an ARB and inclusion in an ARC \n(covered by program beneficiary development on foreign-assisted projects), which considerably \nimprove chances of poverty reduction. They emphasize that landless workers in ARCs and \nARBs outside ARCs remained comparatively poor. The studies clearly brought out the need to \nimplement CARP in a holistic manner and to develop inclusionary approaches toward the \nlandless poor living in the ARCs. This can help reduce social conflict considerably.28  \n \nC.  Lessons Learned  \n1.  CARP Impact Assessment \n23.  The CARP impact assessments discussed above show that there is a need to improve \nthe implementation of land acquisition and distribution with regard to the timely completion of \nland  acquisition,  cadastral  surveys,  requisite  inspection  and  verifications  by  DENR,  and \nissuance  of  secure  and  appropriate  land  titles.  This  will  require  improved  working  and \ncoordination among DAR, DENR, LGUs, and courts, among others, to reduce delays and \nchallenges to the process and to complete land acquisition and distribution. The incomes of \nARBs  in  ARCs  can  be  increased  by  working  on  improving  their  nonfarm  incomes. \nMainstreaming ARBs into the programs of support service agencies and LGUs can help to \n                                                 \n28  DAR. 2003.

Agrarian Reform Communities Project  \n \n24.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  assistance  for  the  Agrarian  Reform \nCommunities Project (ARCP) in 1998.29 The project closed on 1 December 2007. It provided a \nnumber of important lessons both for project design and strategy. Decentralization of project \nimplementation  to  DAR  regional  offices,  LGUs,  and  ARCs,  was  useful  in  raising  local \ncommitment and resources for subproject planning and execution. LGUs have been forthcoming \nwith regard to providing services and resources. A remarkable success of the ARCP has been \nin building strong ARC organizations and promoting the start-up of agribusiness activities. The \nLand Bank of the Philippines\u2019 problems associated with attempting to provide credit to rural \nborrower with little collateral and poor credit histories, demonstrated the need to build the \ncapacity of ARBs and ARC organizations for better financial management and accountability. \nEntrepreneurial skills and management capabilities of target ARCs, cooperatives, and farmer \nassociations were built through on-the-job training by national experts hired by the project. \nDiversification of farm production through demonstration and sharing of know-how and inputs \nhas shown ARBs the way to move from low-value crops to higher-value products and better \nmarkets. Irrigation development has improved crop yields and intensification of cropping. One of \nthe most significant lessons of the project has been the importance of providing improved \nphysical infrastructure and transportation to target ARCs to connect them with bigger and more \ndistant markets and social services. Their lack of credit constrains ARBs from taking better \nadvantage of these. \n \n25.  The experience in project implementation and management gained under ARCP points \nto the need to ensure timely availability of adequate budget cover for planned project activities \nby the Government. It also underscores the need to avoid premature loan cancellations by ADB. \nThe  experience  further  demonstrates  the  need  to  mainstream  project  implementation  and \nimprove governance at all levels. Improved financial and fiduciary responsibility of LGUs has to \nbe ensured through capacity development and careful supervision by the DAR central office. It \nestablishes the need to reduce the geographical spread of areas to be covered by the project. It \nfurther  demonstrates  the  need  to  prevent  elite  capture  of  project  benefits  though  greater \nempowerment of ARC organizations and adoption of a more inclusive approach to the other \nsegments of the rural poor in target areas. It demonstrates the need for greater efforts to build \nthe financial management capacity of ARB organizations, particularly cooperatives; expand their \nmembership and services; and link ARBs with microfinance institutions, banks, and private \nsector organizations that can provide credit, processing support, and marketing links.  \n \n26.  ARCP II will build on the momentum created by the positive outcomes of the ARCP, \nwhile  addressing  the  gaps  in  project  design  and  lessons  learned  from  the  CARP  impact \nassessments.  \n \n3.  Lessons Learned from Other Externally Assisted Projects \n27.

Manila (approved 18 December, $93.2 \nmillion). \n ", "  9\nTechnical  Support  for  Agrarian  Reform  and  Rural  Development,  the  Japan  Bank  for \nInternational Cooperation-assisted Agrarian Reform Infrastructure Support Project (ARISP) I \nand ARISP II, among others, manifest the need for basic support infrastructure, particularly \nfarm-to-market  roads,  access  bridges,  potable  water  supply,  irrigation  schemes,  and  post-\nharvest facilities. The ARC cluster strategy strongly underpins the ARISP III. The ARISP III also \nbuilds a strong case for support to DAR to accomplish its remaining tasks. The Project will \ncoordinate  with  the  ARISP  III  and  other  recent  foreign-assisted  projects  of  DAR  on  the \nexperiences  of  the  ARC  clusters.  Reviews  of  the  World  Bank-assisted  Agrarian  Reform \nCommunities Development Project I and II, and the World Bank\u2019s Mindanao Rural Development \nProject I and II, also demonstrate the importance of concerted efforts at rural development in \nconflict-prone areas of southern Philippines. The Mindanao Rural Development Project II has in \nconcert with DAR developed an institutional reform program for LGUs to adhere to and receive \nup to 20% refund of their equity contribution to the subproject costs. The Project will adopt a \nsimilar approach to building LGU capacity and providing a refund of their equity contribution, \nwhich  is  directly  related  to  their  performance  on  the  agreed  criteria  and  indicators.  The \nexperience of the World Bank-supported Kapit Bisig Laban sa Kahirapan Comprehensive and \nIntegrated  Delivery  of  Social  Services  (KALAHI-CIDSS)  project,  among  others,  further \nstrengthens  the  case  for  stronger  social  capital  formation  and  increased  empowerment  of \ncommunities, through community\u2013driven development. ARCP II will build on these lessons. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome   \n28.  The long-term impact of the Project is to enable ARBs in about 152 selected ARCs and \n11 ARC clusters in 19 provinces30 to reduce poverty, and have sustained improvements in \nincomes and quality of life. The Project outcome includes improved capabilities and well-being \nof poor and marginalized groups in the target communities. This outcome will be pursued \nthrough  the  design  and  implementation  of  an  integrated  and  complementary  package  of \ndevelopment investments, involving support for community\u2013driven development (CDD), support \nto  new  and  expanded  ARC  organizations  and  their  business-oriented  activities,  increased \neffective participation of the poor in community planning and decision-making, agri-enterprise \ndevelopment, infrastructural support, and mainstreaming of project management.  \n \n29.  Target area selection was based on both poverty and identifiable economic potential-\nbased criteria. At the provincial level, the lesson of ARCP to keep the geographical spread \nmanageable was kept in mind. Poverty assessments showed that three quarters of the poor are \nin the Mindanao and the Visayan regions. Targeting these regions is essential to address \nresource inequalities as well as provision of necessary infrastructure and support services for \nthe rural poor. It is also important to correct the regional imbalances in income opportunities \namong the regions in the country. As agreed by DAR and ADB and in consultation with the DAR \nregional  and  provincial  officials,  the  selection  of  the  eligible  provinces  was  based  on  the \nfollowing criteria: \n \n(i)  Provinces with the highest rural poverty incidence.  \n(ii)  Provinces in the southern half of the Philippines that are included in the ADB \n                                                 \n30 The Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) has a list of more than 400 ARCs, of which 152 have been selected as \nthe likely target ARCs. Some of these may still change during the course of implementation depending on their \ncurrent situation, and selection by local government units and DAR provincial and/or regional offices. Others may \nbe added during the course of project implementation. The provinces to be covered include Romblon, Marinduque, \nCamarines Norte, Camarines Sur, Sorsogon, Negros Occidental, Leyte, Eastern Samar, Northern Samar, Western \nSamar, Zamboanga del Norte, Zamboanga del Sur, Zamboanga Sibugay, Maguindanao, Lanao Del Sur, Tawi-\nTawi, Shariff Kabusuan, Basilan, and Sulu. \n ", "10   \nCountry Strategy Paper and Program (2005\u20132007)31  \n(iii)  Provinces with at least four ARCs that have not received financial assistance for \ninfrastructure from foreign-assisted projects of DAR.  \n(iv)  LGUs\u2019 willingness to cooperate with the ARCs and assurances of inter-LGU \ncooperation. \n \n30.  Based  on  the  latest  official  poverty  data,  nineteen  of  the  poorest  provinces  were \nselected, including six in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM). ARCs and ARC \nclusters were selected based on the following criteria: (i) no earlier infrastructure support from \nother  foreign-assisted  projects  of  DAR;  (ii)  demonstration  of  income-earning  potential;  (iii) \nachievement by the ARC of at least level 2 in the ARC level of development assessment, which \nindicates that the ARC has commenced on its own development initiatives; (iv) at least one ARC \norganization having reached an organizational maturity level of 3, signifying capacity to engage \nin economic activities; (v) at least 50% of land acquisition and distribution activities completed, \nindicating that ARBs have tenurial security; (vi) potential for access to markets and facilities; and \n(vii) demonstrated LGU support. In the 19 provinces selected, a total of 152 ARCs fulfilled these \ncriteria. ARC clusters are being identified in a phased manner to target the candidate ARCs that \nhave  several  barangays  with  large  numbers  of  ARBs  not  yet  assisted.  ARC  clusters  with \ndevelopment plans already prepared are being prioritized by the LGUs and DAR. \n \nB.  Project Outputs \n31.  To achieve the outcomes of poverty reduction and sustainable livelihoods, the Project \nwill support the following outputs32:  \n \n(i)   CDD consisting of  \n(a)   social capital formation for community organizing and participation, \n(b)   participatory detailed ARC planning,  \n(c)   organizational development of community organizations, and  \n(d)  improved LGU capacity for better governance.  \n(ii)   Agriculture and enterprise development including  \n(a)   transfer of technology,  \n(b)   entrepreneurship development among ARC organizations,  \n(c)   improved linkages between the private sector and ARC organizations \nleading to increased investments into rural areas for growth,  \n(d)   community-based savings and lending groups, and \n(e)    land tenure improvement.  \n(iii)   Rural infrastructure development.  \n(iv)   Project implementation and management.  \n \n1.  Community Driven Development  \n32.  The objective of this output is to mobilize, organize, and strengthen communities and \nlocal institutions, through the use of a CDD approach throughout the Project. It aims to prepare \nlocal communities and people's organizations for their active participation in the design of \npoverty reduction activities supported by the Project. Greater participation by the poor will be \nencouraged to prevent capture of project benefits by the elite. Support will go to organizing of \ninclusive membership-based groups, developing their capacity, and improving LGU governance.  \n \n33.  The output will consist of the following subcomponents: (i) support to social capital \nformation; (ii) participatory detailed ARC planning; (iii) organizational development of community \norganizations; and (iv) improved LGU capacity for better governance.  \n                                                 \n31 ADB. 2005. Country Strategy and Program 2005-2007, Philippines. Manila. \n32 These are reflected in Appendix 1. \n ", "  11\n \na.  Support to Social Capital Formation  \n34.  The objective of this subcomponent is to prepare and strengthen communities and local \ninstitutions for their informed participation throughout the Project, to improve the sustainability of \nproject investments. A CDD approach33 will be used to engage the poor in the target ARCs and \nARC clusters in identifying priority needs and constraints, as well as subprojects to address \nthem. The activities to be supported will be the following: (i) mobilization of communities and (ii) \nbuilding socially inclusive membership-based organizations of ARBs, non-ARBs, and landless \nworkers in the target areas. The Project will provide support through NGOs and civil society \norganizations, which will deploy trained community organizers, backstopped by expert NGO \nstaff, to work in all target barangays. This subcomponent will also help to identify the training \nand  capacity  development  needs  of  ARB  organizations  and  to  draw  up  training  and \ndevelopment plans for the ARCs. \n \nb.  Participatory ARC Planning   \n35.  The second set of activities will include detailed ARC and ARC cluster planning. The first \nstep after start-up of the project implementation will be the training of planning teams at the \nprovincial level. Training will be provided on community\u2013driven development and safeguard \npolicies  by  subject  specialists  and  NGOs.  This  will  be  followed  by  the  development  of \ncomprehensive ARC plans to be prepared by communities, represented in barangay CARP \nimplementing teams, with technical support from the project teams. The planning process will be \nfully participatory and inclusive of vulnerable groups, and it will be assisted by the NGOs. Close \nattention  will  need  to  be  paid  to  identification  of  marketing  opportunities.  The  Project  will \nfacilitate LGU participation in ARC planning and the incorporation of ARC plans with rural \ndevelopment plans of LGUs.  \n \nc.  ARC and LGU Organizational Development for Improved \nGovernance \n36.  This subcomponent will seek to strengthen local community-based organizations and \nlocal government agencies working with them under the Project, to make them more effective in \nplanning, implementing, monitoring, and sustaining activities within their own areas. This will \nreinvigorate the provincial, municipal, and barangay CARP implementing teams, and the LGU \nentities working with them. It will develop and train ARC cooperatives, microfinance groups, and \nfarmer associations. It will also establish user associations for social services and infrastructure \n(barangay water user and irrigator associations, among others). \n \n37.  The  subcomponent  will  improve  local  governance  and  accountability  of  LGUs  by \nproviding training34 on fiduciary policies and management, as well as on safeguard policies, \namong other areas of capacity development. To deal with the frequent changes in the LGUs \nbecause of evolving political processes, the Project will provide training on a continuing basis to \nensure the longer-term capacity of the LGUs to provide assistance to the ARCs. The Project will \ninvolve  the  legislative  branch  of  the  LGUs  in  project  implementation  to  safeguard  against \npossible changes in the LGUs. \n \n \n                                                 \n33 For details of the community\u2013driven development approach, refer to Supplementary Appendix A which debates the \ncommunity\u2013driven development approach to social capital formation, participatory planning, and implementation. \n34 Training will include linkages between land tenure improvement and agri-enterprise development, community\u2013\ndriven  development  approaches,  environment,  and  other  social  safeguard  policies,  as  well  as  ADB  and \nGovernment policies on procurement, financial management, safeguard policies, and anticorruption, among other \nareas. \n ", "12   \n2.  Agriculture and Enterprise Development \n38.  The purpose of the agriculture and enterprise development output is to provide strategic \nsupport services to participating ARCs and ARC clusters to (i) generate sustained increases in \nagricultural production and productivity; (ii) increase economic activities and value-added in the \ntarget  areas;  and  (iii)  pilot  ARC  connectivity  strategies.  This  output  is  expected  improve \nlivelihoods through better market orientation and value addition by ARBs. The output consists of \nfour subcomponents: (i) agricultural productivity improvement, (ii) enterprise development, (iii) \nland tenure improvement, and (iv) enhanced access to rural financial services.  \n \na.  Agricultural Productivity Improvement \n39.  This subcomponent will enable ARBs and non-ARB small and marginal farmers to move \nfrom subsistence production to market-oriented surplus generation. It will provide assistance to \nARCs based on their needs and priorities identified in the detailed ARC plans. It will accordingly \nsupport training, demonstrations, and cross-learning visits by farmer groups for peer group \nlearning. Among the types of demonstrations and training to be supported are  \n \n(i)  increased productivity through introduction of improved crop varieties; \n(ii)  improved farming practices to increase yields and cropping intensity\u2014this will \ninclude  sloping  land  technology,  organic  crop  production,  certified  seed \nproduction, among others;  \n(iii)  integrated pest management; \n(iv)  enhanced  access  to  and  installation  of  irrigation  systems  (under  the  rural \ninfrastructure component);  \n(v)  crop diversification through environment-friendly farming systems (multistory and \nrotational cropping); \n(vi)  improved post-production handling, especially of perishable produce, to minimize \nlosses; \n(vii)  improved marketability products by improving their quality and safety (not harmful \nto consumers); and \n(viii)  study tours of farmer groups. \n \nb.  Agri-Enterprise and Market Development  \n40.  This  subcomponent  will  support  better  integration  of  market  considerations  into \nsubprojects under the Project. Proposals identified in the ARC plans will need to include market \nassessments  and  marketing  plans.  Business  advisory  units  will  provide  services  to  ARC \norganizations. These advisory units will be established at the provincial level, initially within the \nDAR provincial office, to be turned over eventually to the LGU. A market information system will \nalso be set up at the provincial level in collaboration with the Department of Agriculture\u2019s Bureau \nof Agricultural Statistics.  \n \n41.  To facilitate the development of large agribusiness areas, the Project will support ARC \ncluster development. The target ARCs will be the starting points from which to initiate cluster \nactivities  in  surrounding  barangays.  The  Project  will  focus  on  activities  that  can  clearly \nstrengthen the backward and forward linkages between production, processing, and marketing. \nAbout 11 ARC clusters are likely to be included under ARCP II with a phased approach. ARC \ncluster coordinators with appropriate private sector development background will be appointed \nat DAR regional offices.  \n \nc.  Land Tenure Improvement  \n42.  The Project will support improvements in land titles in agrarian reform lands, with a view \nto strengthening ideas of ownership and commitment among ARBs to improving their lands. The \n ", "  13\nland area covered by collective CLOAs amounts to about 59% of the total area distributed in the \nselected ARCs (outside of ARMM). Land tenure improvement will be undertaken primarily in the \ntarget ARCs where about 55,000 ha will need to be surveyed for subdivision and/or stabilization \nof titles, as per the cropping plans prepared as part of the detailed ARC planning process. About \n22,000 ARBs will be covered under this. \n \n43.   Support  for  land  tenure  improvement  will  include  social  preparation,  surveys,  and \nseparation  of  individual  titles,  stabilization  of  land  titles  of  ARBs.  Social  preparation  for \nseparation of collective issuance of individual CLOA separation will be provided through the \ncommunity\u2013driven development approach. Surveys and separation of individual titles will be \nimplemented with DAR as the prime mover.  \n  \nd.  Improved Access to Sustainable Rural Financial Services \n44.  There is need to mitigate the negative effects on productivity of ARBs\u2019 high levels of \ncredit-related  dependence  on  traders  and  moneylenders.35  The  Project  will  contract  with \nsuitable NGOs, civil society organizations, and microfinance institutions to work with interested \nARCs  in  setting  up  self-selected,  socially  homogenous  people\u2019s  groups  to  help  develop \ncommunity-based  microfinance  activities.  The  Project  will  work  with  selected  microfinance \ninstitutions to develop suitable options for farmers\u2019 credit needs. \n \n3.  Rural Infrastructure Development \n45.  Rural infrastructure is critical to the ability of ARCs and ARC clusters to participate in \nmarket-oriented agriculture and agribusiness promotion. To enhance ARC connectivity and \npromote development of agribusiness lands, the rural infrastructure development output will aim \nto (i) reduce transportation time and haulage costs of rural produce; (ii) reduce cost of farm \ninputs;  (iii) increase  availability  of  irrigation  to  enhance  crop  production;  (iv)  promote  crop \ndiversification; (v) increase cropping intensity and improve yields; and (vi) reduce post-harvest \nlosses and transport damage. In addition, because most ARCs have difficulties accessing clean \nwater, this subcomponent will also provide priority social infrastructure in order to (i) reduce \nincidence  of  waterborne  diseases;  (ii)  generate  time  savings  for  more  productive  use;  (iii) \nreduce health-related expenses; (iv) improve community hygiene and public health; and (v) \nreduce the vulnerability of the rural poor to various types of crises by improving access to \nemergency services. \n \n46.  The  Project  will  adopt  a  community\u2013driven  development  approach  to  subproject \nidentification during the ARC detailed planning, to ensure that interventions provided by the \nProject realistically address the needs of the ARCs.  \n \n47.  The main outputs will include the following subcomponents:  \n \n(i)  Rural  access  infrastructure.  Rehabilitation  and  selective  construction  of \ncritically  needed  barangay  or  farm-to-market  roads  and  their  associated \nstructures, single-lane concrete bridges and low-level crossings, access trails, \nfootpaths, and hanging foot bridges in upland areas; \n(ii)  Small-scale irrigation. Construction and rehabilitation of small-flow communal \nirrigation  schemes,  small  water  impounding  projects,  small  farm  reservoirs, \nshallow tube wells, and drip irrigation schemes for high-value crops; \n(iii)  Post-harvest facilities. Provision of warehouses and solar driers;  \n \n                                                 \n35 The CARP impact assessment in 2003 found that the dependence of the rural poor on landlords was replaced by \nthe growing dependence on traders and moneylenders after the implementation of CARP. This has led to reduced \nincomes, low prices (as compared to open market rates for produce), and perpetuated poverty. \n ", "14   \n(iv)  Potable Water Supply System (PWS). Construction of PWS to include levels I \nand II;36 and \n(v)  Other social infrastructure. Construction and /or rehabilitation of   multipurpose \nbuildings,  tribal  halls,  school  room  units,  daycare  centers,  barangay  health \nstations,  and  small-scale  flood  protection  works.  These  sub-projects  will  be \nconsidered only where the lack of such facilities would jeopardize the creation of \nan enabling environment for sustainable poverty reduction. Indigenous peoples \ncommunities will be given the highest priority in the provision of other social \ninfrastructure.   \n \n48.  Subprojects shall be planned and selected in accordance with the project guidelines \nagreed between the Borrower and ADB. The project guidelines shall include, among others, the \nfollowing selection criteria: (i) prioritization by poor rural communities through the community\u2013\ndriven development approach; (ii) concurrence by the LGU; (iii) willingness on the part of LGUs \nto put up the required equity in accordance with the Borrower\u2019s National Government and Local \nGovernment Unit Cost Sharing Policy approved by the Investment Coordination Committee on \n12 December 2002, and to operate and maintain the facilities in partnership with appropriate \nARC organizations; (iv) LGU willingness to carry out the necessary surveys (including a census \nof affected persons in instances of land acquisition and adverse impacts, a land acquisition \nsurvey (if required), and social surveys), individual subproject feasibility studies by which the \ntechnical and economic viability are verified, and detailed engineering design that includes all \nrequired clearances; (v) preparation of the land acquisition and resettlement plans (LARPs), if \nrequired, or a summary discussion of land report in cases of no land acquisition, (vi) willingness \nof LGUs to abide by ADB and government procurement safeguard and anticorruption policies, \nand to enforce proper financial and fiduciary management; (vii) commitment of LGUs to resolve \nany social or environmental problems; (viii) willingness of the LGUs and ARCs to promote \norganizations within the ARCs to operate and maintain the facilities; (ix) availability of project \nresources; and (x) no financing of proposed subprojects from any other foreign or local projects.  \n \n4.  Project Implementation and Management \n49.  Efficient project implementation and management will be ensured by providing resources \nto support the management structure, which will be fully mainstreamed at the national, regional, \nprovincial, and local levels. To the extent possible, all project implementation and management \nstructures will be established within existing national and provincial government institutions. \nRegular DAR staff will be redeployed to assist in project implementation. The output will include \nconsultant  advisory  services  related  to  project  management,  CDD,  safeguard  policies,37 \nfiduciary responsibility, agri-enterprise development, microfinance and rural credit promotion, \ninfrastructure  development,  monitoring  and  evaluation,  extension  training,  gender  and \ndevelopment, and environment management, among others. \n \nC.  Special Features \n50.  Socially Inclusive Development. The Project is expected to stimulate participatory and \ninclusive social development. It includes a number of measures aimed at supporting community \nmobilization including organizing, training, capacity development in participatory design and \nimplementation; improving capacity to access institutional finance; and building up community-\nbased savings and credit groups, among others. Through these, the Project is expected to \nimprove the local decision-making of the rural poor, reduce dependence on moneylenders and \ntraders, reduce share tenancy, enable community monitoring and implementation, and improve \nARBs\u2019 and other poor farmers\u2019 incomes through access to the open market instead of tied factor \n                                                 \n36 Level I systems have one single supply location standpipe per community; level II systems are community-piped \nlevel I systems with several supply locations. \n37 This will include experts on ADB's policies on indigenous peoples, involuntary resettlement, and the environment. \n ", "  15\nand product markets. The Project\u2019s socially inclusive approach will allow the participation of \nvulnerable groups such as indigenous peoples.  \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan  \n51.  The investment cost of the project is $208.4 million, including taxes and duties of $18.2 \nmillion. Summary cost estimates by expenditure category and by financiers are provided in \nAppendix 2 and details are given in Supplementary Appendix B.

Price contingencies computed at 0.8% on foreign exchange \ncosts and 4.5% on local currency costs; includes provision for potential exchange rate \nfluctuation under the assumption of a purchasing power parity exchange rate. \nd   Includes interest, commitment charges. Interest during construction has been computed \nat the five-year forward London interbank offered rate plus a spread of 0.4%. \nSources: Asian Development Bank and the Government estimates, 2008. \n \nE.  Financing Plan  \n52.  The  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $70  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources (OCR), including price contingencies and financing charges during implementation to \nhelp finance the project.  The total project cost is estimated $208.4 million. About $70 million of \nsuch financing will come from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, while $30 million will come from \nOFID funds to be administered by ADB. The ADB ordinary capital resources portion of the loan \nwill have a 25.5 year term, including a grace period of 6.5 years, an interest rate determined in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility plus a \n0.20% net lending spread; the commitment charge calculated at a 0.15% rate is levied on \nundisbursed  loan  balance;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  set  forth  in  the  Loan \nAgreement. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow \nunder the ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and \n(ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in \nreliance on any communication or advice from ADB. The OFID portion of the loan will have a \n20-year maturity, including a 5-year grace period, a 1% service charge per annum, and 3% \ninterest. \n \n 53.  Proceeds from the ADB ordinary capital resources portion of the loan will finance project \nactivities covering approximately 127 ARCs in the target provinces identified for the Project \nwhile the OFID loan will finance project activities for approximately 25 ARCs in the ARMM and \n ", "16   \nor other poor areas.38 The loan proceeds from the ADB loan and the ADB-administered OFID \nloan will finance 48.0% of the project cost. By source, ADB ordinary capital resources loan will \nfinance 33.6%, while the OFID loan will finance 14.4% of the total project cost. The Government \nwill finance about 52.0% of the total cost, equivalent to $108.4 million. The Government will fund \na part of the cost of civil works, rural finance, and recurrent costs including salaries, operations \nand maintenance costs, and financing charges. The amount includes $52.4 million from the \nbudgetary  appropriations  of  DAR  and  $56.0  million  from  equity  contribution  of  LGUs \nparticipating in the project. National government policy limits its grant financing of infrastructure \nprojects devolved to LGUs to a maximum of 50% of cost.39 The policy applies to the rural \ninfrastructure facilities covered by the project. The nature of the LGU equity may be in the form \nof cash or combined cash and monetized in-kind contributions, such as use of equipment and \nmaterials owned by the LGU. It is agreed that the LGUs may enroll in a reform program with \nidentified goals and measurable benchmarks. Based on satisfactory evidence of their meeting \nthe targets, the LGUs may have 20% of their contribution refunded to them by the national \ngovernment. Government contribution includes an estimated $6 million credit portfolio to be \ntapped from public and private microfinance institutions in support of the project\u2019s microfinance \nassistance to intensify and/or diversify agricultural production and promote rural  enterprise \ndevelopment in the ARCs. \n \n54.  Contributions from project beneficiaries constitute about 5% of LGU equity, mainly in the \nform of donated labor time and indigenous materials.

DAR will be the Executing Agency (EA) of the Project.40 DAR will \nsupervise  the  implementation  of  the  Project  through  its  Foreign-Assisted  Projects  Office \n(FAPsO), in collaboration with other operational units within the department as well as CARP \nimplementing partner agencies and oversight agencies. FAPsO will oversee the coordination of \nproject  implementation,  review,  monitoring,  and  evaluation.  It  will  submit  monthly  and/or \nquarterly financial and progress reports to ADB and oversight agencies. It will manage the \nProject  and  be  responsible  for  delivery  of  project  outputs.  The  EA  will  make  necessary \n                                                 \n38 Flexibility is required in the final selection of candidate ARCs at the time of actual implementation. \n39 National Economic and Development Authority - Investment Coordination Committee Secretariat.  \n40 ADB has been informed by the Government that while there are ongoing evaluations of DAR performance, and \noptions for the future of CARP are under consideration, DAR will continue to be the Executing Agency of the \nProject. The processing is therefore continuing with the existing parameters. \n ", "  17\nbudgetary  arrangements  for  the  Project\u2019s  counterpart  funds  to  be  estimated  12  months  in \nadvance of the anticipated expenditure and ensure that such funds will be allocated in the \nrespective national, provincial, and municipal budgets and released in a timely manner and in \nadequate amounts to allow efficient project implementation, operations, and maintenance. \n \n56.  Project Executive Committee. DAR will work under the supervision and guidance of \nthe project executive committee (PEC), which will be set up and chaired by the DAR Secretary. \nThe DAR Undersecretary designated as the project implementation officer (PIO) for FAPsO will \nact as vice chair. The PEC will include representatives of oversight agencies and partner \nagencies and/or their respective successors.41 Ex-officio members shall include representatives \nfrom involved DAR units and the ADB. It will meet at least once every quarter in year 1 and \nevery 6 months thereafter. It will review and approve annual work plans and budget, flow of \nfunds, cost-sharing with LGUs, use of consultant services, progress monitoring, and all other \nrelevant project activities. There shall be a secretariat, to be headed by the national project \ncoordinator (NPC) of ARCPII, which will handle the technical and administrative requirements of \nthe  committee  under  the  supervision  and  guidance  of  the  director,  project  development \nmanagement staff (PDMS) and FAPsO monitoring and evaluation (M&E) staff. The secretariat \nwill coordinate committee meetings and timely preparation and submission of all project-related \ndocuments for review by the committee, prepare and disseminate the minutes of committee \nmeetings and decisions made by the committee, and handle any other responsibilities allocated \nto it by the committee. \n \n57.  Under the office of the FAPsO, a national project coordination office (NPCO) for ARCP \nII, to be headed by the national project coordinator for ARCPII, will be set up to manage the \nProject and to supervise, monitor, and coordinate project implementation.42 The NPC for ARCP \nII will be based here. He or she will be assisted by the regular FAPsO staff and some 13 \nnational  consultants  in  the  areas  of  project  management,  administration,  finance,  and \naccounting, among others. The NPC for ARCP II, who will report to the PIO FAPsO, will also be \nassisted by a rural development and fiduciary adviser (international consultant) to be engaged \nfor about 24 person-months over the project implementation period.43 The NPC will be regularly \nassisted  by  the  project  management  adviser,  (national  consultant)  to  be  engaged  for \napproximately 36 person months over the project period. \n   \n58.  Implementing  Agencies  and  Specialized  Agencies  Providing  Assistance.  \nImplementing agencies will include all participating municipal LGU and DAR offices at the \nregional and provincial levels. CARP implementing partner agencies such as the Department of \nAgriculture (DA) and Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), Department \nof Public Works and Highways (DPWH) and specialized agencies such as the National Irrigation \nAdministration (NIA) and National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP) will also support \nthe Project. The NCIP, NIA and other specialized agencies whose inputs may be realized for the \nproject, will each sign with DAR a memorandum of agreement, which will spell out their roles, \nresponsibilities, and budget for implementation of specific project activities. DAR-ARMM will \n                                                 \n41 The project executive committee will include the following agencies and/or their successors: National Economic \nand Development Authority, Department of Finance, Municipal Development Fund Office (MDFO), Department of \nBudget and Management, Bureau of Local Government Finance, Department of Agriculture, Department of Interior \nand Local Government, Department of Environment and Natural Resources, Department of Public Works and \nHighways, National Irrigation Administration, Land Bank of the Philippines,  National Commission on Indigenous \nPeople, and the ARMM/DAR-ARMM.. \n42  The FAPsO oversees the NPCOs or PMOs of other foreign-assisted projects as well, as part of the Government\u2019s \nmainstreaming efforts. \n43  All consultant services will be recruited in keeping with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consulting Services (2007, \nas amended from time to time). \n ", "18   \nconclude a similar agreement with ARMM partner agencies.44 The NIA is expected to assist \nweaker LGUs to undertake design of rural infrastructure subprojects, in the setting up of irrigator \nassociations, in establishing irrigation service fees, in operations and maintenance training, \namong others. The NCIP is expected to participate in project committees, and in preparation \nand review of indigenous peoples development plans, land acquisition and resettlement plans, \nand any other indigenous peoples related activities.  \n \n59.  Regional- and Local-Level Project Implementation and Management. The ARCP II \ncovers six regions. Regional offices will be established under the overall management of the \nDAR Regional Directors, who will serve as the regional project managers (RPM).  In each of the \nproject provinces, a provincial project office (PPO) will be established under the supervision of \nthe provincial agrarian reform officer, who will function as the provincial project manager. \n \n60.  At the municipal level, LGUs, as implementing units, will be responsible for the setting up \nof local project offices (LPOs) to be chaired by the municipal mayors. The municipal agrarian \nreform officers, assisted by technical experts and administrative and financial specialists from \nthe LGU, as well as staff from the regional offices and provincial project managers' offices, will \nbe responsible for project implementation at ARC and municipal levels. In close collaboration \nwith the MARO, the LPO will serve as the base unit for all project interventions in the ARCs \nwithin  the  municipality.    The  LPO  will  be  responsible  for  ARC  planning,  agri-enterprise \ndevelopment  activities,  community\u2013driven  development  support  programs,  and  rural \ninfrastructure  subproject  planning,  and  provision  of  required  equity  for  the  relevant  project \nactivities. The local project offices shall coordinate and monitor project implementation and \naddress project-related concerns at the municipal and ARC levels, in close collaboration with \nthe MAROs. At the LPO level, the municipal engineer\u2019s office will be the designated project unit \nfor infrastructure development, while the municipal agriculture office will be responsible for \nagriculture, agri-enterprise development, and livelihoods development activities.   \n \n61.  Implementation Arrangements in the ARMM. For project activities to be carried out in \nthe ARMM, a regional project office will be established prior to loan effectiveness. The DAR-\nARMM secretary will be the regional project manager, responsible for reporting and coordinating \nwith the ARMM regional governor. The DAR-ARMM assistant secretary of operations will be the \nARMM  regional deputy project manager. The management and operations of the regional \nproject office will be mainstreamed in the DAR-ARMM office. Municipal-level LGUs will play \nimportant roles in planning and implementing ARC plans and approved subprojects. The Project \nwill  be  implemented  in  close  consultation  with  local  community  leaders  to  ensure  social \ninclusion and acceptance, with lasting impacts on peace and security. \n \n62.  Fund Flows to ARMM. ARCP II funds will flow directly to DAR-ARMM through DAR. \nSince ARCP II is a national project, DAR central office will transfer funds directly to DAR-ARMM \nfor activities related to CDD, ARC planning, capacity development, agri-enterprise development, \nland tenure improvement, rural financial systems development, and project management. For \nrural infrastructure subprojects, the Municipal Development Fund Office of the Department of \nFinance will transfer funds directly to participating LGUs, based on the cost-sharing agreement \nbetween them and the national government. In the context of the weaker LGUs, particularly in \nthe ARMM, the Project will provide training in fiduciary aspects, financial management, and \nprocurement.   \n   \n63.  Technical Review and Approval Committees. To mainstream and decentralize the \nreview and approval process of subprojects under ARCP II, the process of technical review and \napproval  of  subprojects  will  be  shared  at  the  regional  and  national  levels,  depending  on \n                                                 \n44 For details on the roles and functions of partner agencies and institutions, refer to Supplementary Appendix C, \nProject Management Structure. \n ", "  19\nsubproject cost. A national subproject approval committee will be set up by FAPsO to approve \nsubprojects  costing  more  than  $75,000.  Corresponding  regional  subproject  approval \ncommittees will be set up by the DAR regional offices for all other subprojects. \n \n64.  Financial  Management  Assessment.  The  Executing  Agency  has  strong  financial \nmanagement credentials and experience in managing and utilizing ADB funds under ARCP \nwhich closed in December 2007. The financial management systems are in keeping with ADB \nsystems of financial management. Weaker LGUs, such as those in ARMM, will require capacity \ndevelopment under the Project in financial management, fiduciary requirements, and reporting \nrequirements for ADB and the Executing Agency. \n \n2.  Implementation Period  \n65.  The Project will be implemented over 6 years starting in early 2009. A summary project \nimplementation schedule is given in Appendix 3. \n \n3.  Procurement  \n66.  All goods and services to be financed partly or wholly by ADB or OFID or any other \nsource of financing under the Project will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time).45 The majority of subprojects are expected to \nbe relatively small and unlikely to attract international contractors. Hence, procurement of such \nsmall works will be through the shopping method under ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. All civil \nworks contracts exceeding $100,000 and less than $5,000,000 will be procured through the \nnational  competitive  bidding  procedure  (NCB).  Civil  works  contracts  worth  more  than \n$5,000,000  will  be  procured  through  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB).  Most  rural \ninfrastructure construction will be undertaken using labor-intensive methods, with arrangements \nfor local communities to participate through equity contributions in the form of labor, materials, \nor cash. Community participation in procurement of rural infrastructure works will be supported \nfor small works of up to $10,000. Under certain conditions, if communities have successfully \nparticipated in procurement before, they may participate in schemes of up to $30,000 in value. \nCommunity participation will build the involvement and commitment of local communities, use \nlocal knowledge, and promote the use of labor-intensive technologies. \n \n67.  Goods  to  be  procured  under  the  Project  include  office  equipment  and  supplies, \nmotorbikes,  utility  vehicles,  land  survey  instruments,  planting  materials,  agricultural  and \nprocessing equipment, and school and health center supplies, among others. Procurement of \ngoods valued at less than $100,000 will be done through the shopping method under ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines. Goods valued at $100,000 or more but less than $500,000 will be \nthrough national competitive bidding. All equipment valued at $500,000 or more will be procured \nunder  the  international  competitive  bidding  procedure.  Procurement  under  the  rural \ninfrastructure component will be the main responsibility of the municipal LGU through its bids \nand awards committee in accordance with the provisions of Republic Act 9184. Procurement of \nequipment and materials for schools and health centers will be small (less than $100,000) and \ncan be done through the shopping method. The procurement plan is attached in Appendix 4. \n \n4.  Consulting Services  \n68.  The  Project  will  require  an  estimated  1,230  person-months  of  consulting  services \nconsisting of 1,200 person-months of national consultants and two international consultants for \n                                                 \n45 The Government requested ADB to provide advisory technical assistance (TA) to assist in operationalizing, at the \ncountry level, the commitments reflected in the Paris Declaration. Accordingly, ADB provided TA for Harmonization \nand Management for Results (2005\u20132007) and participated along with development partners in the Philippine \nCountry  Harmonization  Program,  which  has  made  significant  progress  in  aligning  country  processes  in \nprocurement, financial management, and audit. \n ", "20   \na  total  of  30  person-months.  One  international  consultant  will  support  the  national  project \ncoordinator in matters pertaining to rural development, financial administration, procurement \nmanagement,  anticorruption,  and  fiduciary  requirements.  This  international  consultant  will \nprovide technical backstopping to LGUs in financial administration and procurement, as well as \nhelp to improve their fiduciary performance. The other international consultant will assist the \nProject  in  developing  viable  micro  finance  services  for  project  beneficiaries.  The  national \nconsultant team will be led by the national project adviser, who will assist the national project \ncoordinator in project administration. All consultants will be recruited under ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nthe Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The consultants will provide \nspecialized  technical  services  based  on  approved  terms  of  reference  and  scope  of  work \n(Supplementary Appendix D). All national consulting services will be procured through a firm \nusing a quality- and cost-based selection procedure or through individual consultant recruitment \nin consultation with ADB as per ADB Guidelines. The international consultants will be recruited \nin consultation with ADB either through a firm or on an individual basis. All consultant services \nprocurement  will  be  subject  to  prior  review  by  ADB.  The  Government  will  submit  three \ndocuments for prior review by ADB including (i) the request for proposals, including a list of \nshortlisted firms and or individuals, (ii) a technical proposal evaluation report, and (iii) an overall \nevaluation and ranking report. \n \n69.  The  selection  of  consulting  firms,  universities,  institutes,  and  NGOs  to  undertake \nspecialized studies and project-related services will be conducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The Project, \nthrough the DAR provincial offices, will engage the services of local survey firms for land survey \nactivities under the land tenure improvement component. For the CDD approach, the Project will \nrecruit NGOs and civil society organizations to provide expert services in the field. These \norganizations will be recruited at the national, provincial, and local levels using the quality- and \ncost-based selection procedure. NGOs will be evaluated using a set of criteria that will capture \ntheir unique qualifications.  \n \n5.  Anticorruption  Policy \n70.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  of  the  Philippines  and  the  Executing  Agency.  Consistent  with  its \ncommitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to \ninvestigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive \npractices relating to the Project. To support these efforts, provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption \nPolicy are included in the loan regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. Attention \nwas also drawn to the section on fraud and corruption that was added to ADB's Procurement \nGuidelines  and  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants,  particularly  the  need  for  bidders, \nsuppliers,  contractors,  and  consultants  to  observe  the  highest  standards  of  ethics  in  the \nprocurement  and  execution  of  contracts,  and  the  sanctions  if  fraud  and  corruption  are \ndiscovered. Based on the government policy and experience in fighting corruption, the following \npreventive measures will be taken: (i) a procurement committee consisting of representatives \nfrom related departments will be established in accordance with the operating procedures in the \nProcurement  Manual  for  ARCP,  drawn  up  between  DAR  FAPsO  and  ADB,  which  will  be \nupdated for ARCP II.  This commitment will supervise the entire procurement process; and (ii) \nthe Government will also cause DAR to initiate liaison meetings on a semiannual basis with the \nNational Government Audit Office to review and discuss the information on corrupt practices. \n \n71.  All contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project will include provisions \nspecifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the Executing \nAgency and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to \n ", "  21\nthe Project.46 All procurement of consulting services will be subject to ADB prior review. For civil \nworks, the first 5 contracts procured under NCB will be subject to ADB prior review as the basis \nfor the remaining contracts that they may have during the course of implementation. However, \nADB may require submission of a copy of the bid evaluation report for each subproject for post-\nreview to determine if procurement was done according to agreed guidelines. Any adverse \nfinding will result in all related contracts will be declared null and void, with the concerned LGU \nbeing penalized.  \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n72.  The ADB loan proceeds will be released to the Department of Finance through the \nBureau of the Treasury using the existing fund release mechanism for Overseas Development \nAssistance (ODA) projects. Three imprest accounts, two for the ADB loan and one for OFID \nloan, will channel the project loan proceeds. OFID funds are for the infrastructure component in \nARMM and will be disbursed based on ADB clearance. Two imprest accounts (ADB and OFID) \nwill be with the Department of Finance for fund disbursement related to the rural infrastructure \ncomponent and will be channeled through the Municipal Development Fund Office, which will \nrelease  the  funds  to  an  LGU  according  to  performance-based  tranches  prescribed  by  the \nProject. The LGU will maintain an account with an authorized government depository bank \ndedicated to the loan proceeds portion (national government grant) of the subproject cost. \n \n73.  The other ADB imprest account will be with DAR for all other eligible expenses from the \nloan proceeds. The DAR regional and provincial offices will open their respective accounts with \nan authorized government depository bank where project funds will be deposited. For the \nARMM, the DAR central office will transfer funds directly to DAR-ARMM for outputs one and two \n(community\u2013driven  development  and  agriculture  and  enterprise  development),  whereas  the \nMunicipal Development Fund Office will transfer OFID funds directly to LGUs for the rural \ninfrastructure output. Assuming that conditions for the use of Statement of Expenditure (SOE) \nprocedures  are  met  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as \namended from time to time), ADB\u2019s SOE procedures may be used to reimburse expenditures \nand liquidate individual expenditures not exceeding $100,000. To ensure liquidity of funds, the \nimprest accounts will be replenished and liquidated on a monthly basis or when the accounts \nare drawn down by 20% of the initial deposit. The imprest accounts and SOEs will be audited \nannually by auditors acceptable to ADB. \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing and Reporting \n74.  The Project will adhere to the revised and updated financial management guidelines and \nprocedures applicable to foreign-assisted projects being implemented by national government \nagencies.  A  memorandum  of  agreement  between  DAR  and  oversight  bodies  and  CARP \nimplementing agencies will stipulate the agency\u2019s role in the management and disbursement of \nproject funds. FAPsO finance and administrative staff will be responsible for management of \nproject funds and will undertake the processing, disbursement, reimbursement, and financial \nmonitoring of the loan proceeds. Such financial management and control arrangements will be \ncarried out in accordance with government accounting procedures. \n \n75.  Expenditures by DAR regional and provincial offices will be recorded using the new \ngovernment accounting system and the standard government charts of accounts. Separate \nbooks of accounts will be maintained at the regional and provincial levels. At the end of each \nyear, the national project accountant will consolidate all project accounts, including the financial \nstatements submitted by DAR regional and provincial offices and LGU partners. The national \n                                                 \n46 All information pertaining to procurement of goods, works, and services under the Project will be posted on the \nGovernment  of  the  Philippines  website  for  the  same,  http://www.philgeps.net/GEPS/default.aspx,  and \nhttp://www.philgeps.net/ GEPS. \n ", "22   \nproject  accountant  will  submit  the  consolidated  financial  statement  report  to  FAPsO. \nConsolidated project accounts and related financial statements will be audited annually by an \nauditor acceptable to ADB. The audited reports and related financial statements in English will \nbe submitted to ADB not later than 9 months after the end of the fiscal year to which they relate. \nThe Executing Agency will be responsible for the submission to ADB of (i) annual audit reports \nand, (ii) quarterly progress reports. \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n76.  To monitor and evaluate the operational performance of the agencies and institutions \ninvolved  and  the  benefits  obtained  from  the  Project,  DAR,  in  consultation  with  ADB,  will \nestablish a project performance management system in accordance with the project design and \nmonitoring framework (Appendix 1) in the national project coordination office within 1 year of \nloan effectiveness. The project performance management system will monitor and rate (i) key \nactivities (on a physical and financial basis), including consultant recruitment, equipment and \nmaterials  procurement,  procurement  of  civil  works,  training,  surveys,  special  studies,  and \ndrafting  of  implementation  guidelines;  (ii)  performance  in  project  activities  of  various \nstakeholders,  including  LGUs  at  the  provincial  and  municipal  levels,  ARCs,  ARC  clusters, \npeople\u2019s organizations, NGOs, and civil society organizations; and (iii) social, environmental, \nand  economic  impacts,    establishing  benchmarks. It  will  also  introduce  mechanisms  for \nadjusting  project  design  and  project  implementation  arrangements,  and  for  incorporating \nlessons learned from similar projects into project planning. Project monitoring and evaluation \nreports will be submitted by the NPCO, through the DAR-FAPsO, to ADB on a quarterly basis. \nOn project completion, impacts will be evaluated in accordance with a schedule and terms of \nreference (TOR) to be agreed upon mutually by the Government and ADB. A baseline survey \nwill be done prior to actual implementation, followed by an impact assessment at midterm \nreview, an impact evaluation at the end of the Project, and a project completion report to be \nsubmitted within 3 months of project completion. \n \n9.  Project Review \n77.  In addition to normal monitoring, the Project will be reviewed jointly at least twice a year \nby ADB and the Government. The reviews will (i) assess project performance and achievement \nof project objectives and outputs, with particular attention to the application of the community\u2013\ndriven development approach and its effectiveness in including all segments of the poor in the \ncommunity; (ii) monitor financial progress; and (iii) identify issues and constraints affecting \nproject implementation\u2014and work out a time-bound action plan for their resolution. In the third \nyear of project implementation, ADB and the Government will carry out a midterm review to \nassess progress and review project parameters.  \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS AND RISKS \nA.  Economic Benefits \n78.  The Project will help to reduce poverty and improve the well-being of ARB and non-ARB \nhouseholds  in  the  target  of  about  152  ARCs  and  11  ARC  clusters.  A  summary  Poverty \nReduction and Social Strategy is included in Appendix 5. The primary economic benefits to be \nderived from the Project consist of (i) the incremental value of agricultural output and (ii) savings \nin the cost of transportation of farm produce as a result of improved communications. Better \nfarm incomes are expected from improved farm productivity through greater and more secure \naccess  to  water,  improved  seed,  inputs  supply,  better  production  practices,  and  crop \ndiversification. The analysis here draws on the work undertaken by the project preparatory \ntechnical assistance in estimating the cost\u2013benefit analysis for the Project as a whole. \n \n ", "  23\n79.  The benefits considered in the cost\u2013benefit analysis are the computed benefits from the \nProject per type of component activity consisting of the following: \n \nTable 3: Project Benefits Impact \n \nComponent Activity  Physical   Computed Benefits \nTarget \nRoads  1,925 km  VOC and/or transport savings, producer\u2019s surplus \nBridges   2,160 lms  VOC and/or transport savings, producer\u2019s surplus \nFlood Protection Works  4,135 lms  producer\u2019s benefit from crop protection \nCommunal Irrigation Facilities  12,375 ha  Producer\u2019s surplus \nSolar Driers  80 units  Drying fees, other rental fees \nWarehouses  46 units  Storage fees, other rental fees \nPWS  500 units  Water  revenue,  savings  in  medical  expenses,  time \nsavings \nlms = linear meters, PWS = Potable Water Supply System, VOC = vehicle operating cost. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n80.  The rehabilitation and/or construction of communal irrigation systems is expected to \ngenerate a total physical target area of about 12,375 ha of command areas, benefiting about \n7,020 farmers, including about 5,616 ARB households. Increases in cropping intensity are \nexpected to result from expansion in effective service area (for example, included in the design \narea but cannot be served by an existing irrigation system) and from generation of new irrigable \nareas (to be served through construction of a new irrigation facility or expansion in design area \nof an existing facility). For rehabilitated irrigation systems, average cropping intensity is 130% \nwithout-project, calculated to increase to 165% with-project. For new irrigation systems, average \ncropping intensity is expected to increase from 100% without-project to 165% with-project.  \n \n81.  Improved access to irrigation is estimated to increase average yield from irrigated farms \nfrom 40 cavans (Philippine dry measure equivalent to 2.13 bushels) per ha without-project to 80 \ncavans per ha with-project. Aside from irrigation service facilities for rice producing areas, other \ninputs of the Project also induce a shift in the ARCs\u2019 production functions for the other crops \ncultivated. These include the assistance to farmers through technology demonstrations and \ntrainings, credit and/or financing linkages for purchase of production inputs, capability-building \ntrainings, land tenure improvement, and other forms of technical assistance of the Project that \ngenerally lead to improved farming practices and ultimately increase output. Given an average \n10% growth in agricultural gross value added over the previous year, the Project assumes a \nweighted average increase in all crop yields of up to 15% at full development in the sixth year. \nBased on ARCP I performance monitoring data, the incremental increase in crop yield as a \nresult of project interventions can range from 10% to 100%. At full development of the Project, \nthe value of agricultural producer surplus is estimated to reach an average of P284 million from \nall ARCs, or P2.15 million per ARC. \n \n82.  The Project\u2019s technical support services for agricultural development will improve the \nproductivity of coconut, sugarcane, and corn farms (Supplementary Appendix E). There are \nabout 64,000 ha of coconut, 13,500 ha of sugarcane and 1,500 ha of corn on the farm lots of \nabout 39,500 ARBs. Estimated incremental increase in farm outputs is at 18% for coconut, 75% \nfor sugarcane, and 16% for corn. The annual incremental output in agricultural commodities will \nhave a net value of $14 million for rice, $22 million for copra, $9 million for sugarcane, and $0.4 \nmillion for corn, or a total value of $45 million per annum. Specifically, household incomes will \nincrease by 20% on average in targeted ARCs; and 10% of households will achieve an increase \nin income above the poverty threshold by year 10. The Project is also expected to generate \nadditional employment amounting to about 5 million person-days of unskilled labor and 2 million \nperson-days of skilled labor. This is expected to benefit landless and other poor households in \nthe target areas. \n  \n ", "24   \n83.  The rehabilitation and/or construction of an estimated target of 1,925 km of farm-to-\nmarket  roads  will  result  directly  in  a  40%  reduction  in  transportation  costs  for  agricultural \nproduce and a 60% reduction in commuter fares. The estimated influence area of the roads \ncovers about 194,000 ha, of which about 116,000 ha (60%) are agricultural production areas. \nTransportation costs of agricultural produce will be reduced from P280 per ton-kilometer (t-km) \nto P158 per t-km. At full operating cost, savings from agricultural freight is expected to reach \nP131 million. Commuter fares will also be reduced from P44.5 per passenger-kilometer (pass-\nkm) to P18 per pass-km. At an average annual population growth rate of 2% for all ARCs, \nvehicle operating cost savings derived from commuter transport will total P1 billion at full project \ndevelopment (Supplementary Appendix E). \n \n84.  Other  facilities  to  be  supported  by  the  Project  include  solar  driers,  warehouses, \nmultipurpose buildings, and potable water systems. These facilities will be provided primarily in \nareas served by irrigation facilities in consideration of greater volumes of production. User fees \nwill be collected for cost recovery of the facilities. Provision of potable water supply will reduce \nincidence of disease, reduce school absences of children, improve educational performance, \nand reduce water-fetching time. Overall, the Project\u2019s benefits outweigh its costs. The Project \nhas a net present value of benefits amounting to P3,616 million ($78.6 million) and a 29.4% \neconomic internal rate of return. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the Project will remain viable \nwith a 25% increase in cost or a 25% reduction in benefits (Supplementary Appendix E). \n \nB.  Social and Gender Impacts, and Impacts on Target Indigenous Peoples  \n85.  The Project\u2019s benefits and impacts from social capital formation do not lend themselves \nto direct quantification. It is expected that as a result of the Project, ARBs and other poor \nfarming households will strengthen their ability to participate effectively in local planning and \ndecision-making  on  resource  use  and  allocation.  In  particular,  the  community\u2013driven \ndevelopment approach will promote a more socially inclusive development process that will \naddress  gender  and  indigenous  peoples  issues  in  resource  and  capital  ownership  and  in \nentrepreneurial initiative participation \u2013\u2013 women are expected to benefit from microfinance, \nmicro-enterprise development, and technical training. They are expected to play increasingly \nsignificant roles in leadership of people\u2019s organizations. Another unquantifiable social impact \nexpected is greater inclusiveness of indigenous peoples in the target ARCs and ARC clusters.  \n \n86.  Indigenous  Peoples  Development  Framework.  In  keeping  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on \nIndigenous Peoples (1998), an indigenous peoples development framework (IPDF) is prepared, \n(Appendix 6) which will guide the preparation of indigenous peoples development plans (IPDPs) \nfor  subprojects  likely  to  have  impacts  on  indigenous  peoples  (Further  details  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix F). \n \nC.  Involuntary Resettlement  \n87.  The Project is not expected to lead to significant involuntary resettlement. Most rural \ninfrastructure subprojects are relatively small and likely to be executed in already-existing sites, \nfor  example,  farm-to-market  roads  upgrading.  However,  under  certain  circumstances,  land \nacquisition and involuntary resettlement impacts may occur, leading to acquisition of land and \nother assets, and adverse impacts on livelihoods, jobs, and incomes of affected persons. To \nprevent any decline in living standards below pre-project levels, and to make affected persons \ninto project beneficiaries, the Project includes an involuntary resettlement framework. It details \nthe principles to be followed to develop land acquisition and resettlement plan (LARP) for \nsubprojects  requiring  land  acquisition,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement \nPolicy (1995). All affected persons irrespective of their status as titled, or those whose claims \ncan be recognized under the law, or non-titled will be eligible for compensation for assets \nacquired, incomes and livelihoods lost, and rehabilitation assistance. Communal assets that are \nlikely to be acquired will be replaced by the Project with similar assets and/or facilities. All \n ", "  25\nLARPs will be in accordance with the involuntary resettlement framework and subject to final \napproval  by  ADB,  prior  to  subproject  appraisal  and  submission  for  approval.  A  summary \ninvoluntary  resettlement  framework  is  in  Appendix  7.    Further  details  are  available  in \nSupplementary Appendix G.  \n \nD.  Environment Impacts \n88.  The overall project is categorized as B under ADB guidelines. An initial environmental \nexamination (IEE) was prepared for the whole project (SIEE is included in Appendix 8). Most \nsubprojects are small-scale access infrastructures. About 5% of subprojects are likely to have \nfarm-to-market roads greater than 2 km and less than 5 km in length. In general, no significant \nenvironmental impacts have been identified under the overall project. No ARCs have been \nidentified  as  within  or  near  high-biodiversity  areas  or  within  sites  that  are  of  historical, \narcheological, or paleontological significance. At the design stage, mitigating measures will \ninvolve  the  detailed  review  of  location  and  technical  specifications  of  the  proposed  rural \ninfrastructure. Initial review at the DAR regional level will be undertaken, and a final review will \nbe  done  at  the  central  level.  For  general  impacts  of  all  types  of  subprojects  related  to \nconstruction, which is temporary in nature, mitigating measures would include water spraying of \ntransport routes, use of equipment in good condition, and careful planning and scheduling of \nwork. During operation of small irrigation subprojects, the possible impacts to the environment \ncould be contamination of surface and groundwater, and potential leaching of soil nutrients \nbecause of increased use of agrochemicals as a result of crop intensification. These impacts \ncan be mitigated by screening for environmentally friendly substances, intensive training of \nfarmer  irrigators  on  the  proper  application  of  inorganic  fertilizers  and  pesticides,  and  the \nintroduction of and advocacy for organic farming practices. \n \n89.  An IEE was prepared for the whole project, and a site-specific IEE will be prepared for a \nspecific  subproject  scheme  (roads);  these  IEEs  are  intended  to  assist  in  developing \nenvironmental assessment documents for future subprojects. The environmental assessment \nand review procedure will be used to screen future subprojects (Supplementary Appendix H). \nThe  environmental  assessment  and  review  procedure  criteria,  procedures,  environmental \nmanagement and monitoring plan templates, capacity development, institutional arrangements, \nbudgets, and implementation checklists will be used to comply with ADB and Government \nenvironmental requirements. All subprojects falling under category B will be required to prepare \nan IEE for submission to DENR, and the first IEE will also be submitted to ADB for review. Even \nif an IEE is not required, environmental implications will be reviewed and the template for \nenvironmental management and monitoring specific to the subproject type will be followed. No \nenvironmental impact assessment is expected to be required for any future subproject scheme, \nas there is no subproject that is likely to fall under category A classification. \n \nE.  Risks and Countermeasures \n90.  Risks that may constrain project implementation and achievement of objectives and \noutcomes, and ultimately impact project success, include (i) the lack of timely budget releases \nfrom the Government for the Project, (ii) security-related concerns in ARCs covered by the \nProject in ARMM because of local conflicts, and (iii) corrupt practices and weak governance \nleading to misappropriation of project funds and to lack of accountability. The Government has \nprovided  assurances  for  timely  budget  releases  to  ensure  completion  of  subprojects  on \nschedule. As a result of the community\u2013driven development approach of the Project, greater \nparticipation and inclusion of vulnerable groups in local planning and decision-making is likely to \noccur. The Project will work with traditional leaderships, especially in the ARMM, with a view to \nimproving harmony and reducing conflict. Improved livelihoods are expected to contribute to \nreducing conflicts in poor communities in the ARMM. Governance-related risks will be mitigated \nthrough  close  monitoring  and  capacity  development  of  LGUs\u2019  procurement  of  goods  and \n ", "26   \nservices. Governance-related risks in ARMM will be managed through capacity development, \nclose LGU performance monitoring, fund flows, and timely submission of accounts.  \n \nV.  PROJECT ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n91.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances  the  Government  has  also  given  specific \nassurances that will be incorporated in the loan agreement: \n \n(i)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  project  activities,  including  those  under \nsubprojects,  will  comply  with  (a)  applicable  laws  and  regulations  of  the \nPhilippines; (b) ADB environment policies and regulations, specifically ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment  Policy  (2002);  (c)  environment  assessments  and  review \nframework as prepared and agreed for the Project; and (d) the environmental \nmonitoring plan as set out in the summary initial environmental examination \n(SIEE), including preparing initial environmental examination for subprojects. \nThe  Government  will  report  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  in \nDAR\u2019s quarterly progress report. \n(ii)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  land  required  for  the  Project  is  free  of \noccupation; and any involuntary resettlement, as defined in ADB\u2019s Involuntary \nResettlement Policy (1995), will be avoided under the Project. If, because of an \nunforeseeable circumstance, such involuntary resettlement is unavoidable, the \nGovernment  will  prepare  LARPs  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary \nResettlement Policy and the involuntary resettlement framework, and submit \nsuch  resettlement  plan  to  ADB  for  approval  prior  to  commencing  land \nacquisition activities. \n(iii)  The Government will ensure that for an ARC and ARC Cluster, which includes \nancestral domains or indigenous peoples areas, or with significant indigenous \npeoples population, an indicative indigenous peoples development plan will be \nprepared  and  included  in  the  ARC  and  cluster  development  plans  for \nendorsement to the LGU for implementation under the Project. Such plans will \nbe prepared in accordance with the Project\u2019s Indigenous Peoples Development \nFramework as agreed between the Government and ADB, existing national \nguidelines, applicable policies and guidelines of the Government, and ADB\u2019s \nPolicy  on  Indigenous  Peoples,  1998.  The  Government  will  submit  all \nindigenous peoples development plans for ADB's review and approval prior to \nimplementation of the relevant subprojects in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Policy \non  Indigenous  Peoples.  The  indigenous  peoples  development  plans  and \nmonitoring reports will be made available on the ADB website and information \ncontained in such documents will also be made available at municipal and ARC \nlevel to all target communities and other stakeholders. The Government will \nregularly report on the status of indigenous peoples under the Project. In all \nARCs  with  substantial  indigenous  peoples,  they  will  form  a  significant \nproportion of all project beneficiaries under community\u2013driven development \nactivities, capacity building of ARC organizations, agriculture and enterprise \ndevelopment,  land  tenure  improvement,  and  development  of  rural \ninfrastructure. \n(iv)  The Government will ensure that the Project\u2019s gender and development action \nplan is implemented, and equal access to all project activities and training \nopportunities is provided for men and women. Women will form at least 33% of \nall beneficiaries of training programs, microfinance groups, and in membership \nof people\u2019s organizations and project offices.  \n ", "  27\n(v)  The Government will ensure that DAR and project implementing agencies will \nmonitor and inspect on all contractors\u2019 activities related to fund withdrawals and \nsettlements. The Government will further ensure that all contracts financed by \nthe loan proceeds will include provisions specifying ADB\u2019s right to audit and \nexamine the records and accounts of contractors, suppliers, consultants, and \nother service providers as they relate to the Project. \n(vi)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  appropriate  NGOs  and  microfinance \ninstitutions  will  be  contracted  to  provide  specialized  services  for  the  CDD \napproach and other specialized services. \n(vii)  Rural infrastructure subprojects will be planned and selected in accordance \nwith project guidelines (para. 48).  \n \nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness \n92.   The OPEC Fund Loan Agreement will have become effective. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n93.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve  \n \n(i)  the  loan  of  $70,000,000  to  the  Republic  of  the  Philippines  for  the  Agrarian \nReform  Communities  Project  II  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with \ninterest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a term of 25.5 years, including a grace period \nof  6.5  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the \nBoard; and  \n(ii)  the administration by ADB of a loan not exceeding the equivalent of $30,000,000 \nto the Republic of the Philippines for the Agrarian Reform Communities Project II, \nto be provided by the OPEC Fund for International Development. \n \n \n \n                Haruhiko Kuroda \n3 October 2008            President \n ", "28  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets  Data Sources and \nDesign Summary  Assumptions and Risks \nand Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms \nImpact      Assumptions \nARBs and non-ARBs in  ARBs and non-ARBs in  \u2022  Department of Agrarian  \u2022  Government has \napproximately 152 ARCs  selected ARCs and ARC  Reform (DAR) ARC  provided assurances \nand 11 ARC clusters have  clusters increase their  level of development  for timely budget \nreduced poverty and have  annual incomes by at  assessment data  releases  \nsustained improvements  least 10% by 2018  (ALDA)  \u2022  Government continues \nin incomes and quality of  compared to the baseline  \u2022  National Statistics  its  commitment to and \nlife  survey results from 2009  Office family income  support  for  the \nand expenditure  welfare of ARBs \nsurveys  \u2022  Improvements occur in \n\u2022  Baseline survey data   the levels of peace in \n\u2022  Post evaluation report   conflict-prone areas in \n\u2022  Monitoring reports  ARMM as a result of \n\u2022  Loan review reports  Project-led \n\u2022  Midterm review report  developments \n\u2022  Impact assessment  \u2022  LGUs operate with \nstudies  improved levels of \ngovernance  \n\u2022  Project completion \nreports  \u2022  LGUs enroll in an \ninstitutional reform \nprogram whereby on \nfulfilling the \nrequirements of the \nprogram, they will be \nrefunded 20% of their \nequity contribution \n \nRisks \n\u2022  Availability and timely \nrelease of project funds \nhas been a problem in \nthe Agrarian Reform \nCommunities Project  \n\u2022  Security concerns and \npeace and order \nproblems because of \nlocal conflicts and civil \ndisturbances in ARMM \nARCs covered by the \nProject  \n\u2022  Corruption and weak \ngovernance can \njeopardize project \nimplementation \n\u2022  The 50% minimum \nequity requirement for \nrural infrastructure \nsubprojects can pose \nproblems to the \nparticipation of poorer \nLGUs \nOutcome      Assumptions \nWell-being of poor and  \u2022  At least 70% of ARCs  \u2022  Final survey data in  \u2022  ARCs can develop \nmarginalized groups in  and ARC clusters are   2014  greater capacity and \nthe target communities  empowered to improve  \u2022  Final survey in 2014  establish effective links \nimproved  their lives through  \u2022  Municipal data   with private sector, for \nimproved access to  \u2022  Training and technical  better technology, \n ", "Appendix 1  29\nPerformance Targets  Data Sources and \nDesign Summary  Assumptions and Risks \nand Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms \nland, credit,  demonstration  processing, and \nemployment, markets  evaluation and follow- marketing of their \nand  health and  up reports  produce \neducation  \u2022  Department of Agrarian   \n\u2022  At least 30% of target  Reform monitoring and  Risks \nARBs rise above the  evaluation reports  \u2022  Private sector \npoverty line by year  \u2022  Project performance  responses to ARC \n2014  review  requirements may not \n   be forthcoming \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n1. The Project reflects the Government\u2019s Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP),a the Medium-Term \nPhilippine Development Plan (MTPDP)b, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country operations business plan \n(2007\u20132008),c and the country poverty assessment (2004).d The Project is the second of its kind, the first being \nthe Agrarian Reform Communities Project, which closed in December 2007. The Government of the Philippines is \ncommitted to redressing the inequitable nature of resource distribution in Philippine society, mainly in land \nownership and control. Poverty levels are high in rural areas, particularly in southern Philippines (49% of the \npopulation consider themselves hungry and poor). Some of the poorest areas are in southern Luzon, the Visayas, \nand Mindanao, especially in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM). These areas have high levels \nof land concentration and are also prone to conflict. In poor rural communities, residents typically till small \nmarginal holdings or are landless laborers. They have limited access to infrastructure and social services, and \nproduction is mainly for subsistence. Their links with bigger markets and processing facilities are very limited. \nThey are dependent upon landowners or traders, middlemen, and/or moneylenders for credit and for selling their \nproduce. These persons charge them high rates of interest for credit and buy their produce at depressed prices. \nMost such rural poor households are food-deficient and have to purchase rice at inflated prices during lean \nperiods. \n \n2. The Project is anchored in the national strategies for poverty reduction as well as the assessments of the \nperformance of CARP, and certain areas of which require strengthening. The Project will address the serious \nconcerns of rural poverty. It will (i) help to improve equity in access to land through improved titling; (ii) build social \ncapital among the weak and marginal segments of society; (iii) provide an enabling mechanism and environment \nfor their informed participation; (iv) create critically needed infrastructure aimed at improving their access to bigger \nmarkets and improved processing facilities; (v) enable economies of scale; and (vi) facilitate investments into the \nrural economy.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: TI-G \n1. Key Issues  \n \n(i) The Project is classified as a geographically targeted project. This is based on the location of the project areas \nin 19 of the poorest provinces in the country, in southern Luzon, the Visayas, and Mindanao, including the \nARMM.e The Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law was introduced in 1988 and extended for 10 years in 1998. \nIt is currently proposed in the national legislature for extension. CARP targets all segments of the working poor \nin the country for land rights and includes all lands without exception for acquisition and distribution. It also \nincludes provision of support services to the communities of agrarian reform beneficiaries (ARBs) to end their \ndependence upon former landowners and others, and provide them with access to markets and support \nservices for their secular development. \n(ii) The achievements of CARP have been considerable; however, they are below target in both land acquisition \nand distribution and provision of support services. CARP impact assessments show that where the program \nhas been implemented holistically, it has had the desired outcomes of improving incomes of ARBs to a higher \nlevel than non-ARB segments of small and marginal farmer households. It has led to improved human \ndevelopment outcomes and created communities ready to grow. More recent assessments demonstrate the \nneed to complete the land acquisition and distribution process and to include non-ARB segments of rural \npopulations to create the conditions for secular growth. These point to the need for adequate budget support \nand improved capacity of CARP agencies to deliver on their targets.  \n \n \n ", "38  Appendix 5 \n \n2. Project strategy \n \nThe Project addresses many development constraints identified in these strategies and studies. It will help to \ndevelop the capacity of CARP implementing agencies to engage more deeply with rural communities via an \nenlarged  concept  of  target  communities  that  includes  non-ARB  segments.  It  will  encourage  the  informed \nparticipation of target communities in planning and execution of activities, improving the sustainability of project \ninvestments. It will (i) provide improved land titling, (ii) build the basis for community-based rural finance, (iii) \nencourage the development of agribusiness, and (iv) provide critical infrastructure that can enable communities to \nreach markets and support services, and so reduce dependence on informal moneylenders and traders. It will \nsupport mainstreaming of project activities into regular government structures and through government staff, \nreducing the dependence on consultants to implement projects.  \n \n3. Beneficiaries \n \nThe beneficiaries of the project include about 150,000 poor persons in about 44,000 households in 152 target \nagrarian reform communities (ARCs) and 11 ARC clusters in 19 provinces. These are mainly small and marginal \nhouseholds including both ARBs and non-ARBs, with small landholdings growing rice, corn, coconut, rubber, \nsugarcane, and other crops. There are also landless households that work as seasonal farm labor. They are \neasily among the poorest in these areas.  \n \nThe Project is expected to benefit all these segments. Marginal and small ARBs and non-ARB farmers are \nexpected  to  improve  their  membership  in  community-based  organizations  and  to  participate  in  planning \nprocesses. They will benefit through the development of rural infrastructure that gives them access to markets, \nsupport services, and new investments sources. The Project will facilitate links with private investment, enabling \ncreation of jobs through diversified development. Land titles are expected to be secured. Access to bigger \nmarkets through cooperatives and other organizations should lead to better terms of sale for rural produce. \n \nLandless laboring households are expected to benefit through the employment expected to be generated by the \nProject. They are also expected to join cooperatives and community-based groups for financial services and gain \nthrough microfinance initiatives. Women are expected to gain through opportunities for training, access to \nleadership positions in organizations, and livelihood development through microfinance. Indigenous peoples in \nARCs and ARC clusters will be fully engaged in planning and priority investments addressing their needs.  \n \nThe Project is expected to create greater security and harmony by engaging with the poorest and most conflict-\nprone areas and working closely with communities and their leaderships. With improved social capital through \ngreater trust building, community\u2013driven development approaches, and livelihoods improvements, prospects for \npeace will be enhanced. \n \n4. Design Features  \n \nThe Project targets 19 of the poorest provinces in southern Philippines. It further reaches out to some of the \npoorest municipalities, which are conflict-prone. By adopting criteria for selection of target provinces based on \npoverty ranking, and selection of ARCs and ARC clusters using a mix of poverty- and growth potential-related \ncriteria, the Project has been targeted to reach the very poor barangays with poverty levels from 58% to 80%, \nespecially in the ARMM region. Selection criteria were thus able to hone the targeting of project interventions to \nthe  poorest  areas  and  most  disadvantaged  groups.  By  developing  a  well-coordinated  community\u2013driven \ndevelopment approach, it is expected to reach vulnerable groups and create the possibility for their participation to \nbecome institutionalized in municipal planning. Through the participatory ARC planning process, the priorities to be \nincluded in the Project are expected to reflect the constraints of the poor. Better livelihoods for formerly neglected \nsegments should be brought about by improved access to social capital, services, and organizations. Rural \ninfrastructure development should benefit the poor by reducing the cost of transport and movement of people, as \nwell as increasing access to education, health, and other social services. By adhering to ADB safeguard policies, \ninclusive development can occur; and any negative connotations of the process of development can be mitigated. \nMonitoring and evaluation will address these issues in particular. \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nKey Issues. The findings of the social analysis include the following: (i) the poor in the target areas include both \nARBs and non-ARBs who are small and marginal households requiring similar support; (ii) in terms of reaching the \n ", "  Appendix 5  39\npoor in the target areas with critically required support services, a more inclusive approach is required to make \ndents in rural poverty and to achieve economies of scale for project investments and outcomes; (iii) particularly \nvulnerable groups require special support to enable them to participate fully; (iv) women lack equitable benefits \nfrom land acquisition and distribution; and they require particular support for opportunities in training, leadership of \nARC organizations, microcredit for livelihoods, and support services to ease their domestic labor requirements; \nand (v) the poor as a whole remain poor because of the inequitable distribution of resources and power in the \ncommunity, as well as the less-than-perfect factor and product markets. They require secure access to land, \ninputs, capital, technology, and markets to improve their productivity, add value, and create secure employment \nopportunities for the community. The Project is designed to address all these issues through inclusive participatory \nstrategies to support a community\u2013driven development process. Rural infrastructure, social capital development, \nagribusiness promotion, and project management support, including support for critical environmental and social \nsafeguards, will be covered. Monitoring and evaluation will address these issues regularly.  \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  During the project preparatory technical assistance, participatory research and focus group discussions were \norganized in five sample ARCs. During loan fact-finding and the appraisal process, the mission went to \nrandomly selected ARCs to assess the situation firsthand through participatory rapid appraisals, focus group \ndiscussions, mapping, etc. The outcomes are reflected in the social analysis and strategy included under the \nProject. \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and \nmonitoring?  \n \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making      Empowerment \n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \n \nThe key features of the C&P plan are included in the ARC detailed planning. It includes deployment of consultants \nand  nongovernment  organizations  to  train  provincial  planning  teams  in  community\u2013driven  development \napproaches, and for these teams to work with trained municipal officials (led by the municipal agrarian reform \nofficer) and barangay teams to develop ARC plans\u2014based on participatory appraisals, workshops, focus group \ndiscussions,  and  general meetings\u2014to  determine community  priorities and investments required  under the \nProject. Along with participation in the planning process, the barangay CARP implementing team and the \ncommunity safeguard and grievance subcommittee will be trained to carry out social surveys and land acquisition \nplans, where required. The community will also participate in procurement of small civil works. They will have the \nright to scrutinize contracts awarded by the local government units under the Project. They will participate in \noperation and maintenance of project investments, and receive training and support for this.  \nC.   Gender and Development \nKey Issues:  \n \nGender Issues. Women in the rural communities of the Philippines are fairly active economic agents. They \nparticipate in education, income generation, and community activities. In terms of their land rights under CARP, \nthere is an apparent anomaly. While the law recognizes the equal right of both genders to land, about 75% of \nARBs are men. Women\u2019s access to credit, technology, and markets remains limited in the target ARCs. \nKey Actions. Measures included in the design to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment\u2014access \nto and use of relevant services, resources, assets, or opportunities and participation in the decision-making \nprocess: \n \n  Gender plan         Other actions/measures         No action/measure \n \nThe Project aims to address the need for equitable participation by women and men in efforts to reduce poverty in \nthe target ARCs. To this end, the Project includes a gender action plan, which includes strategies and indicators to \nmeasure the extent of women\u2019s participation in activities such as planning, implementation, training, leadership, \nand management of ARC organizations, community-based savings and credit programs, and enterprise \ndevelopment, among other project outputs. For all training programs, microfinance groups, cooperatives, and other \norganizations developed and/or supported under the Project, at least 33% of the participants will be women. \nMonitoring and evaluation will measure the improvement in men\u2019s and women\u2019s savings, credit utilization, \nincomes, human development, and quality of life. \n ", "40  Appendix 5 \n \nIII.

This indigenous peoples development framework (IPDF) \nhas been prepared in a fully participatory manner and in keeping with the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998) and the Indigenous Peoples Rights Act 1997 \nof the Philippines. The framework is based on consultations with all stakeholders through the \nproject preparation stage.1 The social assessments were carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nHandbook for Incorporation of Social Dimensions in Projects (1994).  \n \n2.  The total indigenous peoples population in the Philippines is about 12 million. There are \nseveral indigenous groups within the proposed project area. In each region, however, the \nProject will cover only fraction of the total population of indigenous peoples in the region. \n \n3.  The  Philippines  has  an  adequate  legal  framework  through  which  the  identity  and \nentitlements  of  indigenous  peoples  are  well-defined,  as  are  their  rights  and  the  remedies \navailable under national law to protect their interests. The Indigenous Peoples Rights Act was a \nlandmark law, not only for recognition of the rights of indigenous peoples in the Philippines but \nalso as a milestone in recognition of the rights of indigenous peoples globally.2  The legislation \ntook more than 10 years to develop and move through the legislative process.   \n \n4.  The National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP) is the primary government \nagency  that  \u201cformulates  and  implements  policies,  plans  and  programs  for  the  recognition, \npromotion, and protection of the rights and well-being of Indigenous Cultural Communities \n(ICCs)  indigenous  peoples  with  due  regard  to  their  ancestral  domains  and  lands,  self-\ngovernance,  social  justice  and  human  rights,  and  cultural  integrity.\u201d3  It  is  headed  by  a \nchairperson and six commissioners representing the 12 regions of the country. It operates \nregional and provincial offices and also supports more than 100 community service centers. \n \nB.  Rationale for an Indigenous Peoples Framework \n5.  As noted above, the Project does not focus specifically on IPs but on ARCs and ARC \nconnectivity. Consequently, the number and scope of indigenous peoples involved with the \nProject will be minimal. Nevertheless, it is important that there is a clear understanding of the \nneed for an IPDF for ARCP II. The rationale for such a framework and an indigenous peoples \ndevelopment plan (IPDP) being prepared rests on ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998), \nwhich clearly recognizes the need to address the vulnerabilities of indigenous peoples related to \n                                                 \n1  The Project was prepared under ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the Philippines for Preparing the Agrarian \nReform  Communities  II.  (TA  4390)  Manila.  To  carry  out  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance,  a \nmultidisciplinary team of local and international specialists from the Southeast Asian Regional Center for Graduate \nStudy and Research in Agriculture was engaged. \n2 The Indigenous Peoples Rights Act (1997) was commended by the United Nations during the International Decade \nfor Indigenous Peoples as a breakthrough in recognition of the rights of indigenous peoples within the national \nlegal framework. \n3  Government of the Philippines. 1997. Republic Act 8371, Section 38 and 44 A. Manila. \n ", "  Appendix 6  43\nmainstream development. It also stresses the need to ensure that indigenous peoples can \nparticipate equally in the process of development.  \n \n  1.  Policy Framework \n \n6.  The IPDF is embedded within the national laws of the Philippines and ADB\u2019s Policy on \nIndigenous Peoples. The national government policies on indigenous peoples are embodied in \nthe Indigenous Peoples Rights Act. The NCIP has the mandate for implementation of the \npolicies. Protocols for physical and cultural resources must be observed. This has been ratified \nthrough the Department of the Interior and Local Government memorandum circular 89/2002 \nregarding the \u201cstrict implementation\u201d of the act. \n \n  2.  ADB Policy on Indigenous Peoples \n \n7.  ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples complements other ADB policies and guidelines, \nand  it  applies  equally  to  public  and  private  sector  operations.  The  policy  recognizes  the \nvulnerability of indigenous peoples and addresses the need to ensure that (i) negative impacts \nare avoided, (ii) indigenous peoples are afforded all opportunities to participate in development \nopportunities  under  the  Project,  and  (iii)  advances  are  sustainable.  Furthermore,  in \nimplementation, projects must (i) include respect for indigenous peoples' dignity, human rights, \nand  cultural  uniqueness;  and  (ii)  operate  in  line  with  an  indigenous  peoples  development \nframework (in this case outlined in the following sections) and in line with the initial social \nassessment for the whole project. Project initiatives should be compatible in substance and \nstructure  with  the  affected  peoples\u2019  culture  and  social  and  economic  institutions,  and \ncommensurate with the needs, aspirations, and demands of affected peoples. Initiatives also \nshould be conceived, planned, and implemented, to the maximum extent possible, with the \ninformed consent of affected communities. \n \nC.  ARCP II Indigenous Peoples Development Framework \n8.  Principles.  In consideration of the above potential impacts by the Project on IPs, it is \nessential that project activities give due consideration to the social, cultural, and environmental \ncontexts  prevailing  in  the  project  areas  in  relation  to  traditional,  legal,  and  contemporary \nconcerns  of  any  indigenous  peoples  within  the  locality.  The  Project  must  work  within  a \nframework that ensures adequate participation by IPs and access to benefits:  \n \n  (i)  Community\u2013driven development: \n \n(a)  NGOs will be deployed in indigenous peoples communities for organizing \nand mobilizing communities; \n(b)  Indigenous peoples households within the ARC will be identified through \nthe ARC planning teams;  \n(c)  Through the ARC detailed planning process, indigenous peoples must be \nprovided full opportunities to participate. \n(d)  Indigenous peoples members of people\u2019s organizations under ARCP II \nwill be trained in financial management and business management to \nfacilitate the development of entrepreneurial activities. \n \n   (ii)   Support to agriculture and enterprise development including  \n \n    (a)  Support for productivity enhancement such that \n ", "44  Appendix 6 \n \n(1)  Indigenous  peoples  will  be  targeted  for  entrepreneurship \ndevelopment  and  transfer  of  appropriate  technology  for \nproductivity improvements.  \n(2)  In ARCs with substantial indigenous peoples populations they will \nform a significant part of trainees under the Project; and \n(3)  Business advisory services must be made easily accessible in \nculturally appropriate ways. \n \n(b)  Land tenure improvement \n \n(1)  Through the ARC detailed planning process, issues related to land \ntenure improvement are to be discussed with indigenous peoples \nARBs as well as others.  \n(2)  In all land survey and titling activities due regard and respect as \nwell as recognition for indigenous peoples resources, identity, and \nculture, must be provided. \n(3)  The Project will support indigenous peoples ARBs\u2019 preferences for \nland titling which are in keeping with the national laws and their \ntradition and culture.  \n(4)  The Project will address the risks of indigenous peoples losing out \nto  non-indigenous  peoples  through  the  land  titling  process; \nhowever, as the lands are CARP areas, there is no risk of that \nsort. \n \n(iii)  Support to rural infrastructure in the following manner: \n \n(a)  ARC development plans will prioritize indigenous peoples-specific needs \nthrough a participatory process. \n(b)  In carrying out the detailed planning of rural infrastructure subprojects, the \nstatus of land must be determined in full consultation with concerned                        \nindigenous peoples and/or ICCs where relevant provisions of the IRF \n(Appendix 7) for the ARCP II will apply.4  \n(c)  At all stages of project implementation, the EA will ensure protection \nagainst misuse of environmental resources or cultural sites of significance \nto indigenous peoples, abuse of their customs and culture, or undue \nnegative impact as a result of project activities. \n \n9.  Project Arrangements. The project management arrangements are shown in Table \nA10.1 below. A representative from the NCIP will join the project executive committee, which \nprovides overall policy guidance to the Project; and its designated representative5 will also sit on \nthe national and regional subproject appraisal committees, as appropriate, to ensure that the \nproject  approval  process  has  adequately  covered  the  Free  Prior  Informed  Consent  (FPIC) \nrequirements and that ICCs have been considered in project activities. \n \n                                                 \n4  In any such situation the ADB Involuntary Resettlement Policy will be applicable. Options to land acquisition will \nneed  to  be  identified  though  a  change  in  alignment  of  roads  or  exploration  of  alternative  sites  for  other \ninfrastructure. If land acquisition becomes essential, an involuntary resettlement plan will need to be prepared in \nkeeping with ADB policy. \n5  The National Commission on Indigenous Peoples representatives may be from one of its offices, the indigenous \ncultural communities\u2019 consultative bodies, or tribal councils. \n ", "  Appendix 6  45\n10.  At the implementation level, representatives of the NCIP are already involved in the \nprovincial agrarian reform committee, which has policy oversight of the project arrangements. If \nnot already included, a representative would be included in the CARP teams, as necessary (for \nexample, in provinces and municipalities where the Project will include ancestral domains or \nwhere there are indigenous peoples). At the community level wherever indigenous peoples are \npresent, one or more indigenous peoples community representative will be included6 in the \nbarangay CARP implementing team and municipal CARP implementing team. In addition, in all \nARC  planning  processes  in  areas  substantial  with  indigenous  population,  they  will  form  a \nsignificant percentage of all beneficiaries. \n \nTable A10.1: Components of an Indigenous Peoples Development Plan \nComponents  Subcomponents  Activities  Agencies \n1.

The budgetary allocations support specific activities with a view to promoting indigenous \npeoples  participation  in  the  Project,  promoting  positive  outcomes  for  indigenous  peoples \ncommunities targeted under the Project, and monitoring and evaluating the results. Indirect \nbenefits are expected to accrue from stronger social capital buildup, improved land tenure, \nfacilitation of investments into agribusiness development, improved access to markets, better \nsocial and productive infrastructure, and regular monitoring and evaluation. \n \nD.  Conclusion \n12.  The indigenous peoples development framework is an integral part of the Project. The \napproach  is  to  improve  development  outcomes  for  indigenous  communities  through  their \ninformed participation and decision-making. All planning at the ARC level would be done \nthrough  a  participatory,  culturally  sensitive,  and  responsive  methodology  that  enables \ncommunities to diagnose their own problems, identify solutions, and apply solutions through the \nProject. This will involve building on peoples\u2019 knowledge, transferring technology, and providing \naccess  to  opportunities.  By  supporting  community  mobilization,  capacity  development  of \npeoples\u2019  organizations,  and  emergence  of  community  based  organizations  (CBO)  for \nlivelihoods development, financial services, and agribusiness development, the Project will \nencourage development from the grassroots. Community decision-making, peer learning, and \ngroup-based activities are some of the features of the Project that aim to bring about culturally \nappropriate development among previously isolated communities. All benefit monitoring and \nevaluation will take into account the indigenous peoples requirements, as well as constraints, \nand  address  these  aspects  when  examining  the  extent  to  which  their  lives  were  indeed \nimproved by project interventions. \n ", "  Appendix 7  47\nINVOLUNTARY RESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK \n \nA.  Background \n1.  Agrarian  Reform  Communities  Project  (ARCP)  II  is  not  expected  to  have  major \ninvoluntary resettlement because most of the rural infrastructure subprojects are community-\nidentified and small-scale. However, in accordance with the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995), which is applicable to all ADB projects and project \ncomponents, irrespective of the source of financing, the involuntary resettlement impacts of the \nProject are assessed and an involuntary resettlement framework is prepared for application to \nall project activities, including those done in anticipation of ADB operations.  \n \n2.  The ARCP II involuntary resettlement framework (IRF)1 has been developed based on \nthe Involuntary Resettlement Policy, current ADB resettlement guidelines, and a review  of \nresettlement  guidelines  in  other  projects.  This  framework  is  intended  to  guide  ARCP  II \nimplementation  by  Department  of  Agrarian  Reform  (DAR)  and  project  staff,  stakeholder \nagencies, LGUs, and communities. \n \nB.  Screening Procedures \n3.  The Project will adopt the following screening mechanisms to determine whether the \nproposed subprojects are likely to have land acquisition and resettlement impacts, nature and \nextent of such impacts and required actions to be taken to avoid and/or mitigate the impacts.  \nThe following are steps to screen subproject for impacts: \n \n(i)  Start-up steps. Identification of involuntary resettlement impacts will be made \npossible through the listing of priority subprojects at the barangay level, through \nthe detailed agrarian reform community (ARC) planning by trained municipal \nplanning teams led by the municipal agrarian reform officer (MARO).  \n(ii)  Training of planning teams. Prior to actual ARC planning, the planning teams \nwill  be  trained  by  project  safeguard  specialists,  as  well  as  contracted \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs).  \n(iii)  Detailed  ARC  participatory  planning.  After  the  completion  of  training \nworkshops  at  the  provincial  and  municipal  levels,  detailed  participatory  ARC \nplanning will be undertaken at the barangays constituting the target ARCs and \nARC clusters.  \n(iv)  Technical  design.  Once  the  preliminary  identification  of  rural  infrastructure \nsubprojects is done, and the communities are in agreement and have signed off \non the list, the municipal engineer's office will identify the design parameters and \nprovide information regarding subproject location and land requirements. The \nengineer will clarify if lands and other assets that are not publicly owned must be \nacquired for project construction.  \n(v)  Level of impacts and resettlement plan requirements. Based on the extent to \nwhich land acquisition and related impacts are identified during the initial design \nstage, the project safeguard specialists will determine the kind of land acquisition \nand resettlement plan (LARP) required. For all agreed subprojects with impacts \non  less  than  200  persons,  a  short  LARP  will  suffice,  while  for  subprojects \naffecting more than 200 persons, a full resettlement plan is needed. \n                                                 \n1  For the detailed involuntary resettlement framework and resettlement matrix please refer to the ADB website, and \nto the Supplementary Appendix G on the involuntary resettlement framework, which is available upon request. \n ", "48  Appendix 7 \n(vi)  Land acquisition survey. For all agreed subprojects identified as requiring land \nacquisition, a land acquisition survey is to be done. (The survey will not include \nnon-titled land users, such as sharecroppers, tenants, and squatters.) \n(vii)  Cut-off date. A cut-off date, beyond which no changes in affected persons or \nland  ownership  or  use  claims  will  be  entertained,  is  to  be  agreed  on  and \npublished for each subproject by the planning teams with the barangay CARP \nimplementing  team  and  community  safeguard  and  grievance  subcommittee \n(CSGS).  \n(viii)  Census.  For  all  subprojects  requiring  land  acquisition  and  likely  to  have \ndisplacement impacts, a census will be carried out by the planning teams with full \nparticipation of the barangay CARP implementing team and CSGS. The census \nwill  identify  all  affected  persons  and  their  assets,  irrespective  of  their \nentitlements.  \n(ix)  Socioeconomic  surveys.  For  all  subprojects  requiring  land  acquisition  and \nexpected  to  have  adverse  impacts,  the  safeguard  specialists  will  design \nsocioeconomic surveys to be carried out by qualified researchers.  \n(x)  Resettlement  matrix.  The  planning  team  led  by  MARO  will  prepare  a \nresettlement matrix and determine the compensation payments, other types of \npayments, and special programs required to restore livelihoods and incomes of \naffected  persons.  It  will  also  establish  grievance  redress  mechanisms.  The \nresettlement  matrix  will  be  reviewed  by  the  safeguard  specialists  for  each \nsubproject to be financed under the Project.  \n(xi)  The list of affected persons will be computerized to allow disaggregations of data \nand measurement of impacts and progress made in compensation payments and \nrestoration of livelihoods. \n(xii)  For each subproject requiring land acquisition, the list of affected persons will be \npublished and regularly updated through follow-up surveys. \n \n4.  For all priority subprojects, a LARP will be prepared by the MARO with the assistance of \nLGU staff, under the supervision of the safeguard specialists. The kind of LARP to be prepared \nwill be determined by the extent of identified impacts. It will be submitted through the municipal \nCARP implementing team to the regional and national subproject approval committee and to the \nnational project coordination office. Thereafter, it will be submitted to ADB for review and \napproval. After ADB approval, the detailed subproject design will be prepared and submitted \nwith all necessary documentation to the regional or national approval committee, depending on \nthe cost of the subproject. \n \nC.  Resettlement Policy Principles and Safeguard Procedures \n1.  Objectives of Involuntary Resettlement Framework \n5.  The Project is expected to have only marginal adverse impacts because most of the \nsubprojects are small-scale; however, details will be known only after detailed ARC planning is \ncarried out. The Project will not be implemented in parks and protected areas. To address any \nadverse impacts under the Project adequately, the Government of the Philippines has adopted \nthis involuntary resettlement framework (IRF) that sets forth the resettlement policy principles \nand eligibility criteria for all affected persons under the Project. \n   \n6.  The Project will try to minimize all adverse impacts. For all subprojects, in keeping with \nADB's Involuntary Resettlement Policy as well as the Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1995), all \nthe  requirements  for  safeguarding  the  interests  of  affected  persons,  particularly  vulnerable \n ", "  Appendix 7  49\ngroups, must be satisfied. The IRF sets out the resettlement policy principles and eligibility \ncriteria for compensation, protection, and restoration of livelihoods and quality of life of affected \npersons. \n   \n7.  The principal objectives of the involuntary resettlement framework safeguard procedures \nare to \n \n(i)  identify  potential  adverse  impacts  of  subprojects  at  an  early  stage  of \nimplementation; \n(ii)  ensure that project adverse impacts are avoided, wherever feasible; \n(iii)  minimize adverse impacts as far as possible, when unavoidable; \n(iv)  wherever  such  impacts  are  unavoidable,  conceive  and  plan  resettlement \nactivities  as  sustainable  development  programs,  with  adequate  resources  to \nenable affected persons to participate fully in project benefits;  \n(v)  ensure that affected persons are fully consulted and are able to participate in the \nplanning and implementation of all resettlement programs; \n(vi)  manage compensation processes effectively so that affected persons are fairly \ncompensated for current and future loss; \n(vii)  ensure effective negotiation processes that \n(a) fully inform affected persons of their rights and responsibilities and involve \nthem in subproject processes; \n(b) identify source of compensation; \n(c) ensure smooth processes of appropriate compensation; \n(d) minimize conflicts during the process; and \n(e) avoid any inappropriate access to undue compensation;  \n(viii)  ensure that affected persons are fully assisted to recover their livelihoods and \nquality of life to pre-project levels, and wherever possible bring about positive \nimprovements therein; and \n(ix)  ensure  full  documentation  of  the  planning  and  implementation  of  safeguard \ncompliance. \n \n2.  Entitlement Principles and Eligibility Criteria \n8.   The  following  entitlement  principles  will  guide  the  preparation  of  LARPs  under  the \nProject. \n \n9.  While all adverse impacts of ARCP II subprojects will be avoided where possible, any \npersons who are deemed to be affected adversely as a result of subproject implementation, and \nwho are inventoried during the impact assessment, are entitled to be fully compensated or \nrehabilitated for losses.  \n \n10.  Affected persons include any person, household, firm, or institution that, as a result of \nsubproject activities, is likely to experience loss of assets, jobs, incomes, or livelihoods in terms \nof their right, title, or interest in land, houses or structures, crops, trees, income, or any assets in \nwhole or in part adversely impacted as a consequence of the Project. \n \n11.  Affected persons who are titled holders of property, or those who do not have legal rights \nbut could potentially claim such rights under the law of the Philippines, or those who do not own \nland or property but occupy such lands at the time of the cut-off date (such as sharecroppers, \nfarm workers, tenants, and squatters), all non-land asset owners with title, those whose claims \ncan be recognized under national law or non-titled status, and all affected persons whose jobs, \n ", "50  Appendix 7 \nincomes or livelihoods are likely to be affected in the subproject areas, will be inventoried \nthrough  the  LARP  process.    All  inventoried  persons  will  receive  direct  notification  of  the \nsubproject and the implications for their assets by the barangay CARP implementing team and \nCSGS, with information on the valuation of assets and the rights and responsibilities of a \npotential compensation process. The following entitlement principles will guide the formulation \nof LARPs under the involuntary resettlement framework. \n \n12.  For affected persons losing agricultural land, crops, and trees, \n \n(i)  the overriding principles will include provision of land for land of equal area and \nproductivity satisfactory to the affected person; if the affected person so wishes \nand if the land being acquired represents less than 10% of the total landholding \nof the affected person, and the remaining land represents a viable economic \nholding, cash compensation can be made for the area under acquisition based \non the actual replacement value (market value);  \n(ii)  if the land under acquisition represents more than 10% of the total landholding of \nthe affected person, the affected person will have the right to ask the Project to \nacquire the whole landholding and provide compensation for the land through the \nprovision  of  land  for  land  and/or  cash  compensation  based  on  actual \nreplacement cost (market value); \n(iii)  affected persons will be compensated for standing crops, trees, or industrial \ncrops at full market price; and \n(iv)  affected persons whose land may be acquired temporarily will be compensated \nfor  loss  of  standing  crops,  loss  of  income,  damaged  infrastructure,  and  soil \nrestoration at current market value. \n \n13.  For affected persons losing residential land and house and other structures, \n \n(i)  provision of replacement residential land (house site and garden) of equivalent \nsize satisfactory to the affected person; and cash compensation for structures \nreflecting their full market value without depreciation;  \n(ii)  if the affected person so wishes and if the area to be lost represents 10% or less \nof the total residential site, and the remaining area is still a viable residential site, \ncash compensation may be paid for the area under acquisition at full market \nvalue;  \n(iii)  if  after  acquisition  the  remaining  area  is  insufficient  to  rebuild  the  residential \nstructure lost, then at the request of the affected person, the Project will acquire \nthe rest of the area and structures at full replacement cost of land and structures \nwithout depreciation; \n(iv)  right to collect all salvaged material; \n(v)  transport costs of salvaged material to new site; \n(vi)  tenants who have lost a house for residential purposes will be provided with a \ncash rental fee for 3 months based on prevailing market rate in the area, and will \nbe assisted to identify alternative accommodation; and \n(vii)  if the residential land and structures are to be donated, the donors must sign a \ndeed of donation to be annotated by the Registry of Deeds, along with a signed \ndeclaration of awareness regarding the donation. An independent third party will \nbe required to verify the free and fair nature of the donation. The municipal LGU \nwill cover the cost of resurvey of the donated portion of the land and adjustment of \ntitles and real property tax due. \n \n ", "  Appendix 7  51\n14.  For affected persons losing business, \n \n(i)  provision of alternative business site of equal size and accessibility to customers, \nand satisfactory to the affected person; \n(ii)  cash compensation for lost business structure reflecting full replacement cost \nwithout depreciation; \n(iii)  cash compensation equivalent to income for 1 year in case of permanent loss of \nbusiness, based on declared tax value or local minimum wage; and \n(iv)  cash compensation for lost business during transition period. \n \n15.  For  affected  persons  who  do  not  have  legal  or  customary  or  claims  that  can  be \nrecognized under the laws of the Government of the Philippines, \n \n(i)  such affected persons (tenants, sharecroppers, informal users, squatters) will be \nentitled to rehabilitation assistance based on the local agricultural minimum wage \nfor the transition period; \n(ii)  such affected persons will be included under land for land programs to restore \nlivelihoods and improve their standard of living; \n(iii)  such  affected  persons  will  be  provided  employment  opportunities  under \nemployment programs generated by the Project; \n(iv)  such affected persons will be included in special livelihood restoration programs \nunder the Project and assisted to participate in microfinance development; and \n(v)  the Project will include them in livelihood training programs and facilitate their \naccess to other development opportunities such as microfinance and setting up of \nmicroenterprises. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The Project will use a community\u2013driven development and participatory approach to (i) \ndevelop ARC plans, (ii) identify subprojects and related dimensions of land acquisition, and (iii) \nmeasure outcomes, impacts, and concerns of communities, households, and vulnerable groups. \nThere will be a barangay CARP implementing team to identify and address issues as they \npertain to the barangay in implementation of subprojects. At the same time, a CSGS will be \nformed in the municipal CARP implementing team. All municipal CARP implementing teams, \nbarangay  CARP  implementing  teams,  and  CSGS  personnel  will  be  trained  by  the  project \nsafeguard specialists prior to any planning activities. \n \n17.  The CSGS will be responsible under the MARO and development facilitator for initiating \nthe  ARC  planning  process,  including  all  target  groups  and  vulnerable  segments.  The \ncommunity-based  plan  documents  will  be  duly  signed  by  the  representatives  of  all  the \nparticipating groups and vetted by the project safeguard specialists. All these activities will be \nfinanced by the LGU (Government counterpart contribution) as part of its equity contribution to \nthe  Project.  The  documentation  arising  through  the  CSGS  will  be  incorporated  into  the \nsubproject  proposal  documents  and  will  be  submitted  with  the  other  relevant  subproject \ndocuments to the regional and national project review coordinating committees, as required. \n  \n18.  Oversight  of  the  involuntary  resettlement-related  activities  will  be  provided  by  the \nnational project coordination office, in collaboration with a regional project review coordinating \ncommittee. All documents prepared under the IRF will be submitted to ADB through the national \nproject coordination office for review and final approval prior to any detailed appraisal and \napproval of the subprojects. \n ", "52  Appendix 7 \n \nE.  Development of a Land Acquisition and Resettlement Plan \n  1.   LARP Scope \n \n19.  A LARP is essential for each subproject where involuntary resettlement impacts are \nidentified. This will cover  \n \n(i)  identification of potentially affected persons;  \n(ii)  identification of kinds and extent of impacts on land and other physical assets, \nnon-land  assets,  livelihoods,  and  community  assets,  including  infrastructure, \ncommon property, and resources; \n(iii)  mechanisms  for  deciding  on  compensation  based  on  the  principles  of \nreplacement  cost  of  land  and  non-land  assets,  relocation  and  transition \nassistance, compensation for lost business and livelihoods, reestablishment of \nbusiness and livelihoods, assistance for starting new livelihoods, and assistance \nto  rebuild  social  capital,  social  services,  common  property  resources,  and \ninfrastructure;  \n(iv)  processes for communication;  \n(v)  procedures for valuation of land and other assets;  \n(vi)  negotiation processes for sale and compensation;  \n(vii)  documentation of processes; \n(viii)  monitoring of the process through the municipal CARP implementing team and \nsafeguard specialists;  \n(ix)  generation and implementation of a communication plan to inform, both initially \nand on a continuous basis, potential affected persons of the possible project \nimpacts and their rights and responsibilities in relation to compensation; and \n(x)  grievance redress mechanisms made available to the community to convey to \nthe  municipal  LGU  related  complaints  and  concerns,  addressing  each  in  a \nmanner that is transparent and equitable, recording in detail all complaints and \nthe actions taken. \n \n2.  LARP Formulation \n20.  The LARP is a plan that identifies and addresses any adverse social and economic \nimpacts of the ARC and ARC cluster subprojects. In summary, the LARP will \n \n(i)  provide an assessment of the impacts that each subproject component may have \non the local communities; \n(ii)  quantify in monetary terms the private and public assets that will be affected and \nacquired for each subproject component; \n(iii)  provide a safeguard mechanism by which voluntary donation of land and/or land \nimprovements are not abused; \n(iv)  present  a  plan  that  will  ensure  the  timely  acquisition  of  assets,  payment  of \ncompensation,  and  delivery  of  other  benefits  to  affected  persons,  including \nmeasures that will ensure the orderly and timely relocation of severely affected \nhouseholds when warranted; \n(v)  provide a plan on how the affected persons will be involved in each stage of the \nsubproject, including the implementation of the LARP; and \n ", "  Appendix 7  53\n(vi)  determine the required resources needed to implement the LARP, and cost-\nsharing  arrangements  among  the  implementing  agencies  and  subproject \nbeneficiaries. \n \n21.  There are two basic formats for the LARP\u2014detailed and overview\u2014depending on the \nscale and magnitude of the adverse social impacts of a subproject component. The full LARP is \nrequired if more than 200 people will experience resettlement effects. In addition, the following \nconditions will likewise require the preparation of a full resettlement plan: \n \n(i)  100 or more affected persons are indigenous peoples or in some way vulnerable, \nsuch as households headed by women and persons without legal title; or \n(ii)  50  or  more  affected  persons  are  particularly  vulnerable,  such  as  hunter-\ngatherers. \n \n22.  The short version of the LARP will be required if the number of affected persons does \nnot reach the level of more than 200 pesos. For the ARCP II, it is expected that the shorter \nversion would be required in cases where involuntary resettlement impacts are likely to occur. In \nthe event that there are no resettlement issues, then only a summary discussion on land \nacquisition and resettlement will be required to be annexed to the subproject feasibility study.  \n \nF.  Communications and Submission Processes \n23.  In line with ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (2005), all documents pertaining to the \ninvoluntary resettlement policy and the IRF for all subprojects will be made available to the \npublic in a variety of ways. The Project will develop a communications plan for the IRF and \nindividual subproject-related documents, which will include translations of the documents into \nthe local language and use of leaflets, brochures, radio, local media, and NGOs, among others. \n \n24.  Once the LARP has been completed and approved by the RSAC, it will be submitted to \nthe NPCO and ADB for review and approval. After ADB approval is obtained, it will be submitted \nalong with the detailed project proposal and feasibility study to the ARCP II regional and/or \nnational project review coordinating committee for approval. The barangay CARP implementing \nteam  CSGS  will  formally  submit  requirements  for  compensation  to  the  barangay  CARP \nimplementing  team  and  the  local  project  office,  to  be  considered  by  the  municipal  CARP \nimplementing team, so that funds can be allocated for the compensation package.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "54  Appendix 8 \nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENT EXAMINATION  \n \nA.  Introduction \n1.  This report is a summary of the initial environmental examination (IEE) based on the \nfeasibility  study  conducted  in  sample  sites  for  the  proposed  second  Agrarian  Reform \nCommunities  Project  (ARCP  II)  through  site  assessments  and  consultation  with  the \nstakeholders in the national government agencies (Department of Environment and Natural \nResources [DENR] Environmental Management Bureau, Department of Agriculture, National \nIrrigation  Administration);  local  government  units  (LGUs)  at  the  provincial,  municipal,  and \nbarangay levels; and the communities at the project sites. \n \nB.  Description of the Project \n2.  ARCP II is a follow-on project of the Agrarian Reform Communities Project (ARCP) of \nthe Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) with funding from the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB). The specific outcome of this Project is the long-lasting improvement in the capabilities \nand well-being of the poor and marginalized groups in the target communities. \n \n3.  To achieve this outcome, the Project would have the following outputs: (i) community \ndriven development, (ii) agriculture and enterprise development, (iii) rural infrastructure support, \nand (iv) project implementation management. \n \n4.  The  rural  infrastructure  component  is  all  small-scale  projects  located  in  152  ARCs \n(clusters  of  about  five  to  six  barangays  within  an  LGU)  spread  over  municipalities  in  19 \nprovinces  of  southern  Philippines.  This  initial  environment  examination  is  needed  only  to \ndetermine the extent of impact to the immediate surroundings and environment. Under ARCP II, \nspecific outputs of the rural infrastructure component include rehabilitation and construction of \n(i)  small-scale  rural  access  infrastructure  (farm-to-market  roads,  small-scale  single-lane \nconcrete bridges and low-level crossings, access trails, and footpaths and hanging footbridges \nin upland areas); (ii) small-scale irrigation (small-flow communal irrigation schemes, small water \nimpounding projects, small farm reservoirs, shallow tube wells, and drip irrigation schemes for \nhigh-value crops); (iii) post-harvest facilities (small-scale warehouses and solar driers); and (iv) \nsmall-scale social infrastructure facilities (potable water supply  and small-scale multipurpose \nbuildings and other social facilities, if critically needed.  \n \n5.  Purely public infrastructures for access and social purposes (health stations, day care \ncenters, school buildings) will be turned over to the LGUs for operation and maintenance, while \ncommunity infrastructure like irrigation schemes, warehouses, and solar driers will be operated \nand maintained by farmers\u2019 organizations. \n \nC.  Description of the Environment \n6.  Considering the poverty reduction concerns of the Government and the strategic focus \nof ADB, ARCP II has given priority to the southern half of the Philippines. The project area will \ncover 19 provinces spread across the 6 regions in Mindanao, the Visayas, and the southern part \nof Luzon.  \n \n7.  The topography of the ARC sites ranges from flat to gently rolling in and moderate rolling \nor undulating plains to hilly terrain in some of the ARC areas. A few ARCs have coastal zones \nwith agrarian reform beneficiaries (ARBs) supplementing their incomes through fishing. Of the \n ", "  Appendix 8  55\n19 provinces, about 6 are typhoon areas, with natural calamities frequently affecting agricultural \nand fishing activities of the rural households. Low-lying ARCs, which are traversed by major \nriver systems, are prone to flooding during the wet season because of deforested watershed \nareas and lack of natural drainage outlets. Soil classification in these ARCs ranges from sandy \nloam to clay loam. \n \n8.  While  some  provinces  have  protected  areas  like  forest  reserves  that  have  rare  or \nendemic wildlife species, none of the targeted ARCs are located within or near these high-\nbiodiversity areas. Sites that are of historical, archeological, paleontological, or architectural \nsignificance are also not found in these ARCs. Air quality is relatively clean because of the \nabsence of major industries or geothermal emissions. \n  \n9.  All the ARCs eligible for financing under ARCP II have agriculture-based economies. \nPredominant crops are coconut, corn, rain-fed rice, banana, root crops, and tree fruit. Mono-\ncropping is commonly practiced, with only a few areas within coconut plantations engaged in \nintercropping. Given the constraints on agricultural productivity, the common denominator of \nARCs under ARCP II is the high incidence of poverty compared to the rest of the provinces in \nthe country. \n \n10.  In  almost  all  provinces,  provincial  roads  link  the  rural  areas  to  the  socioeconomic \ncenters, services, and facilities. These roads are usually the arterial link of the municipality and \nbarangays to the national highway. City and municipal roads consist mainly of cement streets \nlocated within the urban centers and maintained by the LGUs. Barangay roads, mostly of earth \nand gravel, serve as access to the ARCs. They are generally impassable and in need of \nrehabilitation. As a result, these ARCs are commonly inaccessible and unconnected to the \nnearest all-weather road leading to nearby urban centers. \n \n11.  Because these sites have agriculture-based economies, there are potential areas for \nirrigation development. It is estimated that about 18% of the total eligible ARC barangays will \nrequire development of their irrigation facilities. \n \n12.  While a majority of the provincial and municipal urban centers have existing potable \nwater supply systems, the rural areas within the ARCs still derive their drinking water from \nunreliable sources like open dug wells, rivers, and creeks. However, many ARCs have easily \navailable natural springs that need to be developed to provide clean and reliable potable water \nsupplies to the communities. \n \n13.  Other concerns in the project areas are inaccessibility to social infrastructure, such as \nhealth and elementary education facilities, and lack of electricity in the remote barangays of the \nidentified ARCs.        \n \nD.  Potential Environmental Impact and Mitigating Measures \n1.  Environmental Issues Related to Subproject Location and Design \n14.  In general, there are no significant environmental problems associated with subproject \nlocations.  There  are  no  ARCs  within  or  near  high-biodiversity  areas  or  sites  of  historical, \narcheological, paleontological, or architectural significance, so subprojects within these ARCs \nwill not affect such areas. \n \n ", "56  Appendix 8 \n15.  The  majority  of  access  infrastructure  would  involve  farm-to-market  roads  to  be \nrehabilitated and a few roads and bridges to be constructed. Individual subprojects would \ninvolve an average of 2 km of farm-to-market roads and about 30 linear meters of single-lane \nconcrete bridges. The existing roads will be upgraded to all-weather condition without increase \nin  width  or  length.  Therefore,  no  right-of-way  problems  are  expected,  while  proposed \nconstruction will avoid forested areas and steep slopes.  \n \n16.  The mitigating measures at the design stage would involve the detailed review of the \nlocation and technical specifications of the proposed access infrastructure. Initial review will be \nundertaken at the DAR regional level, and a final review will be done at the central level. \nProposed  subprojects  located  in  environmentally  sensitive  areas  will  be  recommended  for \nrelocation to alternative routes. The design of access infrastructure will adopt the standard \nspecifications of the Department of Public Works and Highways, with drainage facilities and \nslope protection as necessary to ensure stability.     \n \n17.  Small-scale  irrigation  schemes  will  cover  only  about  50\u2013100  hectares  (ha)  per \nsubproject.  These  are  usually  located  in  the  lowlands  and  far  from  forested  areas  or \nenvironmentally  critical  areas.  Rehabilitation  works  would  involve  restoration  of  damaged \nexisting  irrigation  canals,  structures,  and  drainage  facilities,  and  involve  no  right-of-way \nacquisition.  New  construction  would  include  replacement  of  existing  brush  dams  with  a \npermanent run-of-the-river diversion system with canal conveyance facilities to the irrigable \narea. Right-of-way acquisition for the canal system is expected, with appropriate compensation \nby the Project. To prevent possible conflict from downstream users, if any, water permits will \nhave to be secured from the National Water Resources Board as required under Philippine \nregulation. The design of communal irrigation schemes using this type of diversion will adopt the \nstandard specifications of the National Irrigation Administration, while those that are proposed \nfor small water impounding projects will adopt the standard specifications of the Bureau of Soils \nand Water Management under the Department of Agriculture. These designs will take into \nconsideration  the  necessary  drainage  facilities  and  slope  protection  works  along  areas  of \nembankments and steep side slopes. \n \n18.  Proposed potable water supply projects would only involve level 1 using groundwater \nsources and level 2 using natural springs. Site selection and design would consider factors like \ndependable supply of water source, adequate buffer distance from sources of contaminants \n(toilets, septic tanks, garbage areas), and drainage run-off. Proposed sources will be certified \npotable  by  the  Department  of  Health  or  the  local  health  office.  Design  of  spring  boxes, \ndistribution reservoirs, and pipelines will adopt the standard specifications of the Department of \nPublic Works and Highways and the Local Water Utilities Administration. To avoid possible \nconflict with existing local water districts and other users of the same source, if any, clearances \nand water permits from these institutions will be secured prior to the approval of the proposed \nsubproject.  \n \n19.  All  other  proposed  rural  infrastructure  like  multipurpose  buildings  and  other  social \nfacilities will have very negligible environmental impacts. \n \n2.  Environmental Issues Related to Construction \n20.  Common nuisances caused by construction activities would include dust pollution, noise, \nobnoxious gases, traffic, or obstruction to public access. While all are temporary in nature, they \ncan  be  minimized  through  water  spraying  of  transport  routes,  using  equipment  in  good \noperational condition, and careful planning and scheduling of work. Destabilization of slopes \n ", "  Appendix 8  57\nand soil erosion may also occur along excavation sites, and these could be mitigated by the \nappropriate shoring of areas expected to erode. Another possible impact, the illegal sourcing of \nconstruction materials, can be avoided through proper coordination with local officials. Possible \nwater contamination by oil and grease from heavy equipment repair works can be mitigated by \nproviding ring canals and grease traps around equipment pools and fuel depots, respectively. \nSilt traps will be provided, as needed, around construction sites to prevent eroded materials \nfrom entering water bodies. \n \n21.  Irrigation development would be done mostly within farmlands and far from residential \nareas, causing minimal disturbance to households and potable water supply systems.  \n \n22.  The workforce will be provided with safety gear like construction helmets and work boots \nduring construction. \n \n3.  Environmental Problems Related to Operation \n23.  Operation and maintenance of completed facilities would be the main responsibility of \nthe LGUs through their operation and maintenance committees, irrigation associations, farmers\u2019 \norganizations, and barangay water and sanitation associations. All these organizations will be \ntrained on proper operations and maintenance through the capacity-development interventions \nto be provided under the Project. Vegetation control along farm-to-market roads and de-silting \nand  unclogging  of  drainage  facilities  will  be  done  regularly  by  the  LGU  operations  and \nmaintenance  committees,  while  inspection  of  pipelines  and  cleaning  of  spring  boxes  and \ndistribution reservoirs will be undertaken by the barangay water and sanitation associations. \nThe possible increased use of agrochemicals because of crop intensification will be mitigated \nthrough rigorous training of farmer irrigators on the proper application of inorganic fertilizers and \npesticides and the introduction of and advocacy for organic farming practices. The farmers will \nbe required to develop an integrated pest and crop management program with assistance from \nthe Project. The use of agrochemicals will be controlled following the recommended type and \ndosage of the Fertilizer and Pesticide Authority. The irrigation association would also be trained \non proper irrigation water management and establishment of a system of collecting irrigators\u2019 \nservice fees for sustainability. Reforestation of critical watershed areas of irrigation and potable \nwater sources will be pursued and initiated by the LGUs with assistance from DENR and full \ninvolvement of the barangay water and sanitation associations. \n \nE.  Institutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring Plan \n22.  Mitigation  measures  will  be  largely  the  responsibility  of  contractors  during  actual \nconstruction  procedures,  while  subproject  siting  and  design  will  be  done  by  the  LGUs. \nOperations and maintenance environmental protection measures will be done by the respective \noperations and maintenance committees and organizations, with some assistance from the LGU \nand line agencies. The responsibility for monitoring of compliance with these measures lies with \nDAR project offices at all levels with the full involvement of the LGUs. DAR and LGUs will set up \na mechanism to ensure that monitoring responsibilities are understood and accountabilities are \nclear. A safeguard specialist will be engaged at the DAR central level to provide technical \nassistance to the designated DAR regional and provincial staff. At the municipal LGU, the \nMunicipal Planning and Development Office, the Municipal Social Welfare Development Office, \nthe municipal engineer, and the community officer will be designated as the safeguard unit for \nall types of subprojects. Review of subproject sitings and detailed engineering design will be \ndone by DAR provincial, regional, and central project offices. Reviews will be conducted in \naccordance with the subproject assessment procedures, guidelines, and templates, as well as \n ", "58  Appendix 8 \nthe  environmental  management  and  monitoring  plan  referred  to  in  the  environmental \nassessment and review procedure (EARP). Ground implementation and compliance with EARP \nrequirements will be supervised daily by the LGU\u2019s local project office, with DAR Provincial \nProject  Office  (PPO)  and  the  regional  project  office  conducting  periodic  site  visits.  ADB \nsupervision missions will be undertaken to review and assess the overall work progress as well \nas  compliance  with  safeguard  policies.  The  operations  and  maintenance  phase  will  be \nmonitored largely by the LGUs at the municipal level with periodic assistance from DAR and \ngovernment line and regulatory agencies.  \n \nF.  Public Consultation and Disclosure \n23.  Public consultation and disclosure is a continuing process in project development to \nensure  compliance  with  the  environmental  and  social  safeguards.  Public  consultation  and \ndisclosure of project environment documents were conducted between August\u2013November 2005 \nand  September  2007.  Some  feedback  was  received  on  environment  management \nconsiderations  for  road  construction  and  solar  driers,  and  it  was  incorporated  in  the  IEE. \nConsultations  also  disclosed  and  verified  institutional  arrangements  for  implementing  the \nenvironmental assessment guidelines contained in the EARP.    \n \nG.  Capacity development Activities   \n \n24.  The environmental management capacity of the LGUs, DAR regional and provincial \noffice  staff,  and  the  ARCs  is  rated  low.  Training  is  essential  for  implementing  the  EARP \nframework (Supplementary Appendix I) developed under the Project to comply with ADB and \nDENR environmental requirements for future subprojects. Training (with group workshops on \nskill building and practical applications) will be conducted on the following: \n \n(i)  Philippine Environment Information System (EIS) system, focused on IEE and \nEnvironment Management Plan (EMP) preparation; \n(ii)  Philippine  environmental  regulations  and  ADB  environmental  and  social \nsafeguards; \n(iii)  Philippine watershed and natural resources management; \n(iv)  requirements  and  procedures  for  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  subprojects \n(training on EARP; and \n(v)  understanding  the  subproject  design  and  operations  (overview  of  subproject \ndescriptions\u2014first part of IEE). \n \n25.    The estimated cost for training is P8.80 million, inclusive of the costs of food and \nvenue, training supplies and materials, resource persons, organizing, and facilitation.  \n \n26.  Each  training  would  involve  two  representatives  from  each  barangay,  two  from  the \nmunicipal local government units (LGU) project office (preferably the project engineer and the \nenvironmental officer), and two from DAR (one from the region and one from the province). The \ncost for live-in training is estimated at P1,200 per person per day, while live-out training is P500 \nper person per day. \n ", "Appendix 9  59\nSECTOR ANALYSIS \nA.  Introduction \n1.  Two\u2013thirds of the population live in rural areas and depend on subsistence agriculture \nfor their household income.1 The landless farm workers and small farm cultivators, such as \nthose in the agrarian reform communities (ARCs) constitute the core of the poorer sectors of the \nrural economy.  \n \n2.  During 2001\u20132003, the Philippine economy grew at a respectable pace, notwithstanding \ninternal and external challenges. Gross domestic product growth steadily moved from 3.0% in \n2001 and 4.7% in 2003 to 6.3% in the first half of 2004. Over the same period, the gross \nnational product expanded at an average annual rate of 4.5%, which was on track with the \ntargets set forth in the Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan (MTPDP).2   \n \n3.  The agriculture sector registered a steady growth at an average of 3.8% during the \nperiod  2001\u20132003  and  further  improved  to  6.3%  in  the  first  half  of  2004.  However,  the \nagriculture sector outputs and improved farm incomes achieved did not translate into significant \nsector-wide rural gains over the 3-year period.  \n \nB.  National Policies and Plans  \n \n4.  Comprehensive  Agrarian  Reform  Program.  In  1988,  the  pervading  problem  of \nlandlessness and unequal land distribution prompted the Government of the Philippines to \nlegislate and implement the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP). The primary \nobjectives  of  CARP  are  the  improvement  of  equity  and  the  increase  in  productivity  and \neconomic growth in the rural areas.  \n \n5.  The current 10-point agenda of the current administration focuses on strategic measures \nand priority programs that will spur economic growth, resulting in poverty reduction. Among the \nkey measures to be pursued is the creation of 10 million jobs through the development of 2 \nmillion hectares (ha) of productive agribusiness lands and the provision of assistance to 3 \nmillion entrepreneurs.  \n \n6.  In line with the 10-point agenda, DAR is pursuing the implementation of land tenure \nimprovement and essential support services in ARCs to transform  these communities into \nproductive growth areas and to optimize the utilization of agrarian reforms lands for profitable \nagribusiness ventures.   \n \n7.  Building on Lessons Learned.  The development framework for the Agrarian Reform \nCommunities Project (ARCP) II is premised on a clear understanding of the causes of rural \npoverty in the ARCs. The success and challenges of ARCP led to a greater focus on clarity \nregarding titles, as well as a stronger market orientation for investments.   \n \n8.  Strategic  Approach.  The  proposed  ARCP  II  aligns  strongly  with  the  goals  and \nstrategies of ADB and the poverty partnership agreement3 between the Government and ADB \nthat was formalized on 10 October 2001. Furthermore, the partnership agreement explicitly \n                                                 \n1  Reyes, Celia M. 2001. Impact of Agrarian Reform on Poverty: CARP Impact Assessment Studies 7.

Manila \n ", "60  Appendix 9 \nstates as a key strategy acceleration of agrarian reform by fast-tracking land acquisition and \ndistribution, and by institutionalizing and rationalizing delivery of support services to all ARBs. \n   \nG.  Development Opportunities and Constraints \n9.  Agriculture Potential. A major factor constraining the realization of the development \npotential  of  the  agricultural  sector  is  inadequate  allocation  of  fiscal  resources  to  irrigation \ndevelopment and farm-to-market roads, thus limiting farm productivity. The national government \nis making a major shift of infrastructure priorities to the rural areas. \n \n10.  Productivity  Increases.  Agriculture  development  has  achieved  successful  poverty \nreduction in previous and current projects. The ARCP design for support to agriculture and \nenterprise development is still appropriate and should be continued and enhanced under ARCP \nII.   \n \n11.  Vast Scope.  As of June 2006, there are more than 4 million ARBs on 6.7 million ha \nacross the Philippines, representing 73% of the total CARP target of 9.1 million ha. DAR has \norganized almost 1,800 ARCs, including those in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, \ncovering about 1.7 million ha. Collectively, the ARCs cover 42% of the total land transfer \nachieved to date. Significant effort is still required to move ARBs from subsistence production \ninto sustainable commercial-oriented production that will ultimately lead to the ARC households \nmoving permanently above the poverty line.   \n \n12.  Enhancement  of  Connectivity  of  the  ARCs.  DAR  has  been  seeking  innovative \napproaches by which to achieve stronger and longer-term economic impact in the ARCs as well \nas  in  non-ARC  barangays  with  a  considerable  number  of  ARBs.  To  enhance  the  ARC \ndevelopment strategy, DAR is now promoting an approach that goes beyond ARC boundaries, \nsuch as ARC connectivity.   \n \n13.  Land  Tenure  Improvements.  A  number  of  challenges  in  the  land  acquisition  and \ntransfer process still need to be addressed, including the subdivision of collective certificates of \nland ownership awards, amortization of land, resolution of disputes among beneficiaries, and \naccurate technical descriptions of lands, among others.  \nD.  Conclusion \n   \n14.  The Project will address the key concerns of the rural sector and aim to break the vicious \ncycle of debt, low incomes, and lack of access. Through a social inclusion approach, it will bring \nin the vulnerable and formerly neglected segments in target areas to gain a voice in decision-\nmaking and an opportunity to participate in improving the quality of their lives. \n ", "Appendix 10  61\n.  \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE SECTOR \n \nTable A9.1: Loans \nTotal \n \nProject   Funding Source  Regions Covered  Project Cost \n \n(P million) \nAgrarian Reform Communities  I, II, III, IV, VI, XI, XII, \n1.
