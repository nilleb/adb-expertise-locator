The Government of the Philippines has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nto provide technical assistance (TA) to strengthen the capacity of the Mindanao Economic \nDevelopment  Council  (MEDCo)  to  support  and  coordinate  private  sector  development  in \nMindanao,1 particularly in view of the key role the private sector is expected to play in the \ndevelopment of the Brunei Darussalam-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines East ASEAN Growth \nArea (BIMP-EAGA) subregional cooperation initiative. The TA design was developed through \nextensive consultations between concerned stakeholders and the review of the earlier TA (TA \n2622-PHI) for MEDCo's capacity building.2 \n \n2.  Given the major contribution of the private sector to the country\u2019s economic growth, and \nits  contribution  to  reducing  poverty,  including  in  rural  areas,  the  Government  places \nconsiderable emphasis on supporting private sector development. MEDCo is the designated \npermanent Philippine Coordinating Office for BIMP-EAGA (PCOBE). As such, it is responsible \nfor coordinating the Philippines Government activities related to BIMP-EAGA.  \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  TA 2622 allowed MEDCo to upgrade and acquire the technical skills it requires to fulfill \nits original and new responsibilities. With the Government\u2019s renewed commitment to BIMP-\nEAGA  as  the  Asian  economic  crisis  subsided,  and  considering  the  Government\u2019s  overall \nobjective of improving private sector competitiveness, developing the private sector has become \ncritical. MEDCo can facilitate the private sector strengthening process in Mindanao, provided it \ncan gradually build up the necessary capacity. Accordingly, MEDCo needs to develop its own \ncapacity to integrate and unify private sector development programs and activities, help improve \nthe  business  climate  and  help  strengthen  the  institutions  that  promote  private  sector \ndevelopment in Mindanao as mandated under Executive Order 512 of 19 March 1992.3 \n \n4.  After  the  creation  of  BIMP-EAGA  in  1994,  the  Mindanao  private  sector  showed \nconsiderable interest in taking the lead role in the region\u2019s development. While some success \nwas achieved in the trade, tourism, fisheries, and construction sectors, the BIMP-EAGA initiative \nhas lagged in the development of a dynamic private sector. Strengthening of the private sector \nstalled because of the Asian economic crisis and the adverse weather phenomena that severely \naffected the productivity of Mindanao\u2019s agriculture in the late 1990s. Competitiveness of the \nprivate sector in general and of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in particular needs to be \nimproved. SMEs form the backbone of Mindanao's private sector; they are a key component of \nits primary productive sectors. However, private sector investment has been slack due to the \nresurgence of the peace and order issue in parts of Mindanao.  \n \n5.  Providing  business  development  services  (BDS)  is  essential  for  increasing  the \ncompetitiveness of SMEs. Such services typically consist of training and advisory activities to \nenable SMEs to interact effectively with new markets, modern technology, investment partners, \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 2 June 2002.  \n2  ADB. 1996. Technical Assistance to the Republic of the Philippines for Capacity Building for the Philippine \nCoordinating Council for BIMP-EAGA. Manila (TA2622-PHI amounting to $400,000). \n3 MEDCo\u2019s responsibilities, staffing description, and organization chart are in Appendix 1. ", "2   \nand suppliers of financial services. The public sector has subsidized BDS in the past to address \nthe lack of familiarity of SME entrepreneurs with management and technical skills. However, \nsuch an approach can result in (i) over-dependence of SMEs on public assistance, (ii) lack of \nsustainability of the service, and (iii) limited outreach capacity. In consequence, schemes aimed \nat  developing  the  BDS  market  encounter  difficulties  in  being  successful.  In  some  cases, \nhowever, government provision of BDS remains critical, particularly where small businesses are \nspread across wide geographic areas. Under such circumstances, public sector intervention \nmust focus on promoting the development of the local private sector-led BDS market instead of \nproviding direct assistance to individual firms and enterprises. The provision of BDS, particularly \nwhen delivered by the public sector, also needs to be linked more effectively to a wider strategy \nfor creating a vibrant business environment.  \n \n6.  SMEs  face  a  number  of  constraints  as  confirmed  by  a  recently  completed  study \nprepared with ADB assistance.4 Little information is available at present to effectively design, \ncoordinate,  and  implement  intervention  mechanisms  or  to  monitor  changes  in  the  SME \nenvironment. Similarly, there is no information tool available to the stakeholders who require \ndata to plan and implement SME development programs. There is no comprehensive and \nreliable  database  on  SMEs  in  Mindanao  either.  These  information  gaps  contribute  to \ninefficiencies  in  formulating  comprehensive  development  strategies  for  the  SME  sector  in \nMindanao, thereby weakening efforts to develop business activity. \n \n7.  Structures at the local government level, i.e. local government units (LGUs), chambers \nof commerce, BIMP-EAGA working groups and the East ASEAN Business Council (EABC), \nwere meant to work together and promote, as well as strengthen linkages between LGUs and \nthe private sector in BIMP-EAGA. However, they became inoperative as the Asian economic \ncrisis dampened economic activity and regional cooperation. Subsequently, economic activity \nresumed, highlighting the weakness of the linkages between LGUs and the private sector. The \nlack of interaction between LGUs and the private sector to coordinate areas of common concern \nundermined the capacity to provide the enabling environment the private sector needed locally.  \n \n8.  Another  difficulty  confronting  the  private  sector,  including  SMEs,  is  its  insufficient \ncapacity to make representations on national constraints that affect it locally. Corollary to this is \nthe private sector\u2019s limited capacity to access appropriate levels and areas of expertise on new \nmarkets,  modern  technology,  interested  investment  partners,  and  suppliers  of  credit  and \nfinance. Promoting private sector activity in Mindanao thus requires a better communication \nframework for the private sector to be able to relate to the public sector. Developing a strong \npublic-private partnership will hold a key for promoting the private sector in Mindanao. \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n9.  The TA will build the capacity of the MEDCo private sector-SME development unit that \nwill be set up for enhancing private sector and SME development efforts in Mindanao. About 59 \nstaff in the different beneficiary agencies will receive direct or indirect training as a result of the \nTA. The TA framework is at Appendix 2. \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 1999. Technical Assistance for Small and Medium Scale Enterprise Development in the EAGA Region. \nManila (Regional TA 5880, amounting to $300,000). The study focused on the Indonesia and Philippine areas of \nBIMP-EAGA. ", "    3\n \n10.  With this capacity built up, MEDCo is expected to be able to provide a systematic and \ncoherent framework within which the Government and other development partners will seek to \npromote Mindanao\u2019s private sector development. In the process, MEDCo is expected to identify \nappropriate  mechanisms  and  institutional  linkages  that  will  facilitate  the  establishment  of \neffective industry clusters within Mindanao.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA will provide MEDCo with intensive training and capacity building in the following \nareas. \n \n12.  Enhance Business Development Support. Hands-on training of MEDCo staff with the \nDepartment  of  Trade  and  Industry  (DTI),  the  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise  Development \n(SMED) Councils and selected business service organizations (BSO) which provide BDS, will \nenhance MEDCo\u2019s capacity to assess the current situation, opportunities, and constraints in \nMindanao\u2019s BDS market. With this, MEDCo will gain understanding of each agency\u2019s functions \nand increase its capacity to coordinate and integrate SME development programs in Mindanao \nand Palawan. Institutional and market mechanisms will be identified through consultations, \nparticipatory dialogs, and focused group discussions with the private sector. Recognizing that a \nprincipal issue affecting SMEs is their difficulty to access credit and finance, MEDCo staff will be \ntrained in helping identify mechanisms to improve the relationship between SMEs and financing \nsources.  Accordingly,  representatives  of  local  financial  institutions  will  be  invited  to  attend \nworkshops to clarify the needs and concerns of SMEs and financial service providers. The focus \nof  the  BDS  component  of  the  TA  will  be  to  give  MEDCo  the  capacity  to  help  create  a \nsustainable  and  conducive  environment  for  a  private  sector-led  BDS  market  in  Mindanao. \nTraining will be provided also on setting cost-recovery mechanisms for the provision of BDS. \n \n13.  Promote  Coordination  and  Communications.  A  framework  will  be  set  up  for \nconducting regular dialog, coordination, and monitoring of programs and projects with other \ngovernment agencies, LGUs, the private sector, and the external assistance community, using \nexisting mechanisms where possible. Parallel to this, an SME data management system will be \ninitiated  that  will  (i)  establish  a  reliable  data  base  on  SMEs  in  Mindanao  to  provide  the \nstakeholders information on SME activities; and (ii) update the mapping of SME development \nprograms and projects initiated under ADB regional TA 5880.5 The SME database will be \nhyperlinked to existing databases of government line agencies. \n \n14.  Build up LGU-Private Sector Synergy. MEDCo received initial training for LGU-private \nsector  coordination  under  TA  2622.  Under  this  initiative,  LGU  capacity  to  improve  the \nenvironment required by the private sector will be strengthened as follows. First, linkages will be \ndeveloped among LGUs locally and with those in the BIMP-EAGA subregion, in areas where \njoint action can have a national or subregional impact, e.g., in identifying regulatory deficiencies, \nor exchanging trade-related information with other LGUs. Second, participatory and consultative \nmechanisms  will  be  created  to  improve  private  sector  participation  in  the  formulation, \nimplementation and monitoring of local government priorities, including (i) policy and institutional \nreforms as well as advocacy; (ii) identification of infrastructure requirements, especially related \nto the mobility of goods and services, or the provision of post-harvest and storage facilities; and \n(iii) strengthening of local vocational and skills training. \n                                                 \n5 ADB. 1999. Technical Assistance for Small and Medium Scale Enterprise Development in the EAGA Region. \nManila. ", "4   \n \n15.  Enhance Public Private Sector Partnership. Eminent private sector leaders will help \nmobilize interest of the BIMP-EAGA private sector in the development of Mindanao. This will \ninclude (i) identifying and consolidating private sector priorities in Mindanao and the subregion; \n(ii) helping stakeholders make representations in the public and the private sectors, especially \nwhere private sector expansion may be blocked by national level policies; (iii) facilitate private \nsector access to necessary expertise and information available in the public sector; and (iv) \nadvising ADB on the implementation of the TA. \n \n16.  Flexibility has been built into the TA to allow responding to unexpected requirements, \nopportunities, and challenges that might arise in the course of implementation, in view of the \ndifferent needs and or capability levels of BSOs. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $271,000 equivalent, comprising $111,000 in \nforeign exchange and $160,000 equivalent in local currency. The Government has requested \nADB to finance $111,000 equivalent to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and $89,000 \nequivalent of local currency costs. The TA will be financed by ADB on a grant basis from the \nADB-funded TA program. The Government has agreed to provide the equivalent of $71,000 in \nkind for counterpart staff, administrative and office costs, and contingencies. The specific cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  MEDCo will be the Executing Agency for the TA. A private sector-SME development unit \nwill be created under the Economic Affairs Division of MEDCo prior to the beginning of the TA. \nThe unit staff will be the primary beneficiaries of the TA activities.  \n \n19.  A team of individual international and domestic consultants will be engaged to implement \nthe TA. It is estimated that the TA will require 29 person-months of consulting services: 12 \nperson-months of international and 17 person-months of domestic consulting services. The TA \nwill be implemented over a period of 12 months, starting in November 2002 and ending in \nOctober 2003. The team leader will be engaged for the duration of the TA. Domestic consultants \nfor the trade and investment component and for the information management component will be \nengaged for a period of 8 and 3 person-months, respectively.  \n \n20.  The team leader will have expertise in organizing and strengthening BSOs. The two \ndomestic consultants (one with expertise in trade and investment facilitation and the other with \nexpertise in information management) will help the team leader implement the training and \ncapacity building activities. Sector experts will be engaged as short-term domestic consultants \nto provide specific expertise.  \n \n21.  A learn-by-doing approach and direct technology transfer methodology will be used for \nthe training process. MEDCo staff will directly assist the consultants in the assessment of \ncapacity  and  training  needs  of  the  private  sector  organizations,  and  communicate  the \ncorresponding  findings  to  national  government  agencies  (NGAs).  MEDCo  staff  will  also \ncomplement NGAs in the design and implementation of training programs and capacity building \nactivities. With this, MEDCo staff will acquire technical skills and capacity to provide effective \nassistance to the private sector to coordinate SME development. \n ", "    5\n22.  At least six private sector BDS facilitating organizations (one each in the primary growth \ncenters \u2014 Butuan, Cagayan de Oro City, Cotabato City, Davao City, General Santos City, and \nZamboanga City) will be identified for the conduct of training activities. These organizations will \nbe selected using criteria to be established jointly by the team of ADB consultants, MEDCo and \nADB in consultation with DTI and appropriate agencies such as the SMED Councils. At the \nonset, mechanisms to recover the cost of organizing training activities for the private sector will \nbe discussed with the identified BSOs to explain that while the service is of a public nature, \ncosts are attached to it and that such costs are expected to be recovered. The presence of \nADB-financed consultants and experts is expected to encourage BSOs to participate and share \nthe expenses related to the training and capacity building activities as a first step towards full \ncost recovery of the services provided.  \n \n23.  Participating LGUs will be identified in areas where the BSOs organizations are located. \nThe TA will take advantage of existing mechanisms such as the regional development councils \nto strengthen private sector development programs and activities at the LGU level. The councils \nwill be used also as a venue for policy advocacy and for discussing infrastructure planning and \nfinancing requirements. \n \n24.  The  short-term  sector  experts  financed  by  the  TA  will  support  implementation  by \nproviding BSOs specific advice and skills in such technical fields as trade finance, resource \nprogramming  and  mobilization,  project  development  and  management  and  feasibility  study \npreparation, technology sourcing, and market development. Other fields of expertise will be \ndetermined in the course of the TA. Short-term sector experts are expected to be engaged for a \ntotal of 12 person-months.  \n \n25.  To further enhance the role of the private sector in Mindanao, eminent persons will be \nengaged as resource persons. They will help identify and consolidate regional priorities for the \nprivate sector in Mindanao and the subregion, as well as help conduct the advocacy work \nrequired at the highest levels in the public and private sectors, especially to remove policy \nconstraints to private sector expansion. As part of the criteria for their selection will be their \nformer  and  present  position,  reputation,  and  understanding  of  private  sector  dynamics  in \nMindanao and in the BIMP-EAGA region.  \n \n26.  The consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB Guidelines for the \nUse of Consultants, and other arrangements acceptable to the ADB on the engagement of \ndomestic consultants. Equipment will be procured under ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \nThe outline terms of reference for the consultants are described in Appendix 4.  \n \n27.  Information related to private sector activities including SMEs will be disseminated to \nconcerned stakeholders using MEDCo\u2019s existing structures, i.e. the Media Affairs Division and \nthe Management Information System Division. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n28.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $200,000 on a grant basis to \n \nthe  Government  of  the  Philippines for  Capacity  Building  of  the  Mindanao  Economic \nDevelopment Council to Enhance Private Sector Activity in the Philippine EAGA, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board.

Responsibilities and Organization  \n \n1.  The Mindanao Economic Development Council (MEDCo) is a government agency based \nin Davao, Mindanao. Under Philippine Executive Order 512, signed on 19 March 1992, MEDCo\u2019s \nprimary  functions  are  to  (i)  coordinate  development  in  Mindanao,  and  (ii)  formulate  and \nimplement policies and programs. Under its expanded mandate under Executive Order 244, \nissued on 5 May 2000, MEDCo is also responsible for monitoring activities of the Government of \nthe Philippines related to the Brunei Darussalam-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines East ASEAN \nGrowth Area (BIMP-EAGA). \n \n2.  The MEDCo secretariat was constituted in 1993. It consists of an executive director, six \ntechnical  divisions,  and  one  finance  and  administrative  division.  Each  technical  division  is \nheaded  by  a  chief  economic  development  specialist,  assisted  by  a  supervising  economic \ndevelopment specialist, senior economic development specialists, and, an economic researcher \nor a clerk. An administrative officer of senior level heads the finance and administrative division. \n(Figure 1). \n \nB.  Asian Development Bank (ADB) Assistance to MEDCo  \n \n3.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided technical assistance (TA) to MEDCo1 in \ntwo phases: phase 1 reviewed and assessed MEDCo\u2019s existing institutional arrangements and \nset  up  a  strategy,  an  organizational  structure,  and  a  staffing  framework  for  a  permanent \nPhilippine  coordinating  office  for  BIMP-EAGA  (PCOBE).  This  phase  also  called  for  the \npreparation of a capacity building plan based on the future requirements of the PCOBE and the \ndrafting of enabling issuances to ensure that the strategies and structure were put in place. \nPhase 2 of the TA was to implement the recommendations of phase 1. \n \n4.  Phase 1 was completed in May 1997 and recommended the creation of a new PCOBE. \nThe Government, however, decided to set aside the recommendation for reasons of economy \nand efficiency. Instead, MEDCo, the ad hoc Philippine national secretariat for BIMP-EAGA, was \nofficially designated as the permanent Philippine coordinating office for BIMP-EAGA. MEDCo \nwas  also  designated  as  the  lead  government  agency  to  coordinate  the  formulation  and \nimplementation of policies and programs, and monitoring of all related activities in BIMP-EAGA. \nTo  integrate  Philippine  BIMP-EAGA  efforts,  Palawan\u2019s  regional  cooperation  activities  were \nincluded within the scope of MEDCo\u2019s responsibilities.  \n \n5.  Implementation of phase 2 began in January 2001 and was completed in June 2002. An \ninstitutional reassessment of MEDCo relative to its expanded responsibilities formed the basis \nfor  defining  MEDCo\u2019s  core  objectives  in  respect  of  other  government  and  private  sector \norganizations in Mindanao. The TA also allowed MEDCo to upgrade and acquire new technical \nskills to enable it to fulfill its role as the lead Philippine agency in BIMP-EAGA.  \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 1996.
