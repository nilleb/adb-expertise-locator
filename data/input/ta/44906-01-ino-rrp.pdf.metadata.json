The  pilot  investment  will \naddress  existing  exporter  demand  for  manufacturing  retrofits  to \ncomply with advanced processing standards in overseas markets. \nThe remaining $70 million under the A-loan will be used to facilitate \naccess for Indonesia Eximbank\u2019s existing and new clients to term US \ndollar trade finance, working capital, and refinancing, which includes \nshortening the maturity of the high-interest loans taken during the \nfinancial crisis. Similarly, the B-loan will help Indonesia Eximbank \novercome  its  financing  gap  for  US  dollar  term  lending  and  meet \nexporter demand for term trade finance and working capital.  \n   \nFinancial Intermediary  Indonesia Eximbank  \n   \nDevelopment Impact  Expanded  access  to  term  trade  finance  and  working  capital  for \nIndonesia\u2019s  corporate  and  small  and  medium-sized  exporters  will \nfacilitate expanded exports and employment. The nonsovereign loan \nwill pioneer energy efficiency finance in Indonesia to help exporters \nupgrade equipment and comply with International Organization for \nStandardization  (ISO)  50001,  thereby  both  reducing  the  carbon \nfootprint  of  the  exported  product  and  supporting  government \nobjectives on national energy conservation. \n   \nProposed ADB  ADB  proposes  extending  an  A-loan  of  $100  million  from  ADB\u2019s \nAssistance  ordinary capital resources and a B-loan of up to $100 million on a \nbest-efforts basis, to be funded by commercial banks.  \n \n ", "ii \nRisks and Mitigating  The  main  risks  are:  (i)  timely  support  from  the  government, \nMeasures  (ii)  pioneering  energy  efficiency  financing,  (iii)  vigorous  business \nstrategy, (iv) new risk management system, (v) portfolio structure, \n(vi) refinancing risk, (vii) regulatory risk, and (viii) currency risk.  \n \nThese are mitigated by the following: (i) loan covenants that provide \nkey structural protection for ADB, including the right to terminate the \nfacility in the event of any material change in Indonesia Eximbank\u2019s \ncharter law, specifically its ownership structure and the government\u2019s \ncommitment to maintain minimum capital of Rp4 trillion; (ii) the TA \nsupporting  the  development  of  energy  efficiency  financing; \n(iii) increased staff complement of corporate finance experts to assist \nwith  business  strategy  implementation;  (iv)  recently  upgraded  risk \nmanagement system; (v) ongoing NPL resolution, close monitoring by \nthe  Ministry  of  Finance,  and  Indonesia  Eximbank\u2019s  strong \ncapitalization; (vi) recent successful bond issuance in the growing \ndomestic market and improved access to  funding from international \ncommercial banks and bilateral financial institutions; (vii) requirement \nto comply with prudential regulations for which it is accountable to \nboth the Ministry of Finance and Parliament;  and (viii) some of the \nbank\u2019s  clients,  exporters  and  large  corporates,  will  have  dollar \nrevenues and a natural foreign currency hedge. \n \n   \nJustification / ADB  ADB\u2019s support to this transaction is justified by many kinds of value \nValue-Added  addition to the export credit agency (ECA). First, ADB\u2019s investment \nwill  help  Indonesia  Eximbank  access  additional  commercial  term \nlending through the B-loan and thereby support the ECA\u2019s long-term \nfunding  strategy  in  the  market.  Second,  based  on  the  scope  of \nregional ECA activity in financing energy efficiency, and in response \nto industry demand in Indonesia, ADB\u2019s pilot investment will visibly \ndemonstrate  the  viability  of  energy  efficiency  finance  to  domestic \ncommercial banks for projects with paybacks of up to 5 years, thereby \nfacilitating  replication.  Third,  ADB\u2019s  new  environment  and  social \nsafeguard  policies  and  procedures  will  enable  the  new  ECA  to \nintegrate best practice across its portfolio of customers and in the \nbanking community. \n   \nImplementation  ADB  will  monitor  implementation  through  semiannual  reports \nArrangements  submitted to it and semiannual and annual unaudited and audited \nfinancial statements. Technical assistance (TA) will be provided to \nassist monitoring, particularly with respect to developing a sustainable \nenergy efficiency loan portfolio and term trade finance products. \n   \nNSO Rating  NSO7 (BB) \n   \nRating Rationale  The Obligor Risk Rating of NSO 7 (BB) reflects the bank\u2019s strong \ncapitalization and good liquidity profile, offset by weak asset quality, \nhigh borrower concentration including large exposure to state-owned \nenterprises (SOEs),  nascent  risk  management  system,  and  a  still \nrecovering international trade environment.  The Facility Risk Rating \nis also NSO 7 reflecting the 3.24 years average weighted life of the ", "                    iii\nloan which is considered standard for a financial institution.  \n \n   \nTechnical Assistance  TA  for  Institutional  Capacity  Building  of  Indonesia  Eximbank  will \n(i) support Indonesia Eximbank\u2019s development of a range of products \nfor financing trade and energy efficiency, (ii) train bank staff, and  \n(iii)  build  capacity  on  sustainable  risk-sharing  agreements  with \ndomestic commercial banks to leverage access to these products for \nall categories of exporters in a manner that mitigates against claims \nrisk and nonperforming loans for Indonesia Eximbank. The TA will \ncost $1,450,000, of which (i) $1,100,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis  by  the  Asian  Clean  Energy  Fund  under  the  Clean  Energy \nFinancing Partnership Facility and (ii) $350,000 will be financed as a \ngrant from the Financial Sector Development Partnership Fund and \nadministered by ADB. \n \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto Indonesia Eximbank of up to $200 million, of which (i) up to $100 million is funded by Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB) ordinary capital resources (the A-Loan), and (ii) up to $100 million, \non a best efforts basis, is funded by commercial banks (the B-Loan). The report also describes \nthe  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Institutional  Capacity  Building  of  Indonesia \nEximbank. If the Board approves the proposed loans, I, acting under the authority delegated to \nme by the Board, will approve the TA not exceeding the equivalent of $1,450,000 from the  \nAsian  Clean  Energy  Fund  under  the  Clean  Energy  Financing  Partnership  Facility  and  the \nFinancial Sector Development Partnership Fund. The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1.  \n \nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \nA.  Economic and Sector Background  \n2.  Indonesia has weathered the global crisis much better than expected. Its economy grew \nby 4.5% in 2009, in sharp contrast to the 2.8% contraction in the global economy. On the \ndemand side, growth was supported by government spending, driven up 17% year-on-year by a \nfiscal stimulus package that allowed domestic consumption, which accounted for 70% of gross \ndomestic product (GDP) in 2009, to remain strong and help offset the negative impact of the \nglobal crisis on the export sector. On the supply side, economic recovery was led by the retail \nsector. Construction and other services also expanded as a result of the government's stimulus \npackage. In 2010, GDP grew by 6.0%. Exports in 2010 reached $150 billion, the highest figure \never achieved in the country\u2019s foreign trade. \n  \n3.  The rebound was broad based and supported by improved current and capital accounts. \nNoting  the  improved  government  debt-GDP  ratio  and  growing  foreign  currency  reserves, \nStandard & Poor\u2019s upgraded Indonesia's foreign- and local-currency sovereign bonds to BB with \npositive outlook, and, more recently, Moody\u2019s upgraded its local- and foreign-currency sovereign \nratings to Ba1 with stable outlook.1  \n \n4.  Banking sector. According to Fitch, Indonesian banks posted a steady performance in \n2008 and 2009, as core profitability above average helped offset the impact of higher provision \ncharges. The 10 Indonesian banks rated by Fitch posted higher pre-provision operating profit, \nhaving benefited from superior net interest margins as high lending yields were maintained and \ndeposit  rates  (with  shorter  maturities)  were  repriced  in  an  environment  of  falling  domestic \ninterest rates. Banks\u2019 aggregate rate of nonperforming loans at the end of 2009 was 3.8%, \nlargely unchanged from 2008. Indonesian banks are expected to further improve their financial \nperformance with the more favorable domestic macroeconomic outlook.  \n \n5.  With the sharp downturn in external trade, loan growth in 2009 came entirely from \nrupiah-denominated loans, as foreign currency loans contracted by 20% to account for 15% of \ntotal  loans.  This  largely  reflected  commercial  banks  deliberately  reducing  foreign  currency \nexposure, following volatility in the rupiah and much tighter US dollar funding conditions from \nthe fourth quarter of 2008 to the first quarter of 2009. Compared with 2008, the sharpest \n                                                 \n1  Standard & Poor's in May 2010; Moody's on January 2011. Moody\u2019s has rated the Indonesia sovereign one notch \nbelow investment grade. \n ", "2 \nslowdown  was  in  working  capital  loans.  With  global  demand  still  recovering,  pockets  of \nweakness may still exist in certain export-driven manufacturing industries, which may slow \ncredit provision, particularly to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). \n \n6.  Impact of the global financial crisis on trade finance. The Group of Twenty (G-20) \nFinance Ministers' Summit in London convened in April 2009 to address fiscal, monetary, and \nfinancial actions to ensure the effective functioning of international trade markets. In response to \nthe forecast 10% contraction in world trade volume in 2009, the G-20 agreed to ensure the \navailability of $250 billion in trade finance support over 2009\u20132010. The combined effects of \ndemand-side contraction in advanced economies on emerging markets\u2019 exports and supply-side \ntightening in trade finance as reflected in increased liquidity premiums, tight internal credit, and \nrisk limits\u2014as well as disruption in international capital markets\u2014rapidly increased the price of \nshort-term trade finance by 25\u2013300 basis points and prompted a sharp move away from open \naccount trading to transactions using letters of credit and confirmed letters of credit. Tight credit \nconditions thus increased both the cost of and access to trade finance, further debilitating global \ntrade.  \n \n7.  To loosen bottlenecks along the trade finance supply chain, the G-20 trade finance \ninitiative agreed on a coordinated approach to strengthening capacity in trade finance across \nmajor trading regions. Initiatives included new programs to mitigate risk or enhance liquidity \nsuch as the United Kingdom's letter of credit guarantee scheme, Japan's buyer credit financing \nto developing country banks, the Export-Import Bank of the United States' expanded working \ncapital program for United States exporters, and Korea Eximbank's support to exporters through \nrediscount and collateralization programs offered through the country's domestic banks.  \n \n8.  Indonesia's  official  export  credit  agency.  To  mitigate  the  adverse  impact  of  the \ninternational financial crisis on external trade and provide access to rupiah and foreign currency \ncredit for labor-intensive manufacturers, as well as to provide working capital for directly and \nindirectly exporting SMEs, the government established Indonesia's official export credit agency \n(ECA) in September 2009. The ECA was created as a distinct legal entity under Law Number \n2/2009, which established the Indonesia Eximbank. The ECA is structured under a separate act \nof the republic and fully owned by the government. As the country's official ECA, its mandate is \nsimilar to that of the ECA members of the Berne Union of international credit insurers, i.e., to \nprovide financing, guarantees, and/or insurance, as well as supporting advisory services, to \nIndonesian  exporters  in  accordance  with  the  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and \nDevelopment  (OECD)  guidelines  of  the  arrangement  on  officially  supported  export  credits. \nIndonesia\u2019s main exports are mineral products, electrical equipment, palm oil, textiles, base \nmetals,  rubber,  crude  petroleum  products,  oil,  and  liquefied  natural  gas.  Its  major  export \nmarkets are the People\u2019s Republic of China, the European Union, India, Japan, Malaysia, and \nthe United States.  \n  \n9.  Constraints in the commercial banking sector. At present, the commercial banking \nsector in Indonesia presents the following gaps with respect to producers\u2019 access to finance:      \n(i) loans are mostly short term and for consumers; (ii) exporters have limited access to open \naccount transactions; (iii) working capital, or pre-shipment finance, requires full collateralization, \nwhich is a major constraint, particularly for SMEs; and (iv)  services to finance energy efficiency \nare  not  available,  denying  enterprises  access  to  the  integrated  energy  audits  and \ncomplementary term financing that would facilitate compliance with International Organization \nfor Standardization (ISO) 50001, which is increasingly necessary for accessing international \nmarkets (para. 15).  \n ", "                    3\nB.  Energy Efficiency Sector Overview \n10.  Large market potential. ADB estimates energy efficiency could reduce peak electricity \ndemand by 2,500 megawatts, which is roughly equivalent to the existing electricity shortfall \nestimated by Indonesia\u2019s state electricity company. ADB conservatively estimates Indonesia's \nenergy efficiency retrofit required to realize these savings to cost $3 billion: $1.1 billion for \nelectrical equipment, $1.0 billion for existing coal-fired systems, and $0.9 billion for diesel-fired \nplants.2 An additional $1 billion ($800 million in electrical equipment retrofits and $200 million in \noperating efficiency improvements) is required to retrofit shopping malls, office buildings, and \nhotels.  \n \n11.  As  energy  efficiency  investments  are  one-third  to  two-thirds  the  cost  of  centralized \ngenerating plants, the rationale for energy efficiency becomes especially compelling for highly \nintensive  industrial  energy  users  in  cement,  iron  and  steel,  petroleum  refining  and \npetrochemicals,  fertilizers,  pulp  and  paper,  agro-processing,  and  textiles.  The  industrial, \ncommercial, and residential sectors can realize efficiency gains of up to 30% by upgrading \nbackup and captive generators to micro-turbines; advanced cogeneration; and/or tri-generation \nthat combines cooling, heating, and power. ADB raised awareness on the scope of energy \nefficiency savings and the range of demand-based solutions to a wide group of stakeholders, \nincluding commercial banks, equipment suppliers, and regulators, during a major conference.3 \nThe conference also highlighted the limited commercialization of energy efficiency technologies. \n \n12.  Supporting  regulations  and  the  government\u2019s  adjustment  of  electricity  tariffs.     \nThe government has reviewed electricity prices and subsidy policies in response to the sharp \nrise in world oil prices in 2008 and the resulting increase in the budget deficit.4 To attract foreign \ndirect investment in the energy sector and stimulate energy conservation, the Ministry of Energy \nand Mineral Resources issued a decree in July 2010 to increase the electricity tariff of $0.06 per \nkilowatt-hour by a minimum of 18%. The government has moved to eliminate fuel subsidies to \npower generators, industry, and some transport operators. The enabling environment for energy \nefficiency has thus improved, and there is now significantly stronger incentive for industry to \nconsider investing in energy efficiency.5  \n \n13.  Commercial finance opportunities. With respect to opportunities to finance electrical \nequipment, ADB assessed the electricity costs of major export sectors (textiles, paper, and \nrubber)  and  reviewed  the  results  of  available  energy  audits  to  determine  the  scope  of \ncommercially viable investments. Based on ADB\u2019s initial sector studies undertaken over August \n2009\u2013August 2010, projects with payback periods of up to 5 years are conservatively estimated \n                                                 \n2  ADB.  2007.  Technical  Assistance  for  Supporting  the  Implementation  of  the  Energy  Efficiency  Initiative  in \nDeveloping Member Countries. Manila (TA6392-REG). ADB\u2019s energy efficiency market assessment in Indonesia, \nconcluded in 2008, indicates that industry gets 41.3% of its energy from coal, 25.4% from natural gas, 20.8% from \nkerosene and diesel, 11.4% from electricity, and 1.1% from liquefied petroleum gas. With 30% participation in \nenergy efficiency, Indonesian industry has the potential to save $738 million per year ($362 million in electricity, \n$205 million in coal, and $171 million in kerosene and diesel). \n3  Financing $4 Billion Energy Efficiency Solutions in Indonesia, November 2009, Jakarta.  \nhttp://www.adb.org/Documents/Events/2009/Energy-Efficiency-Solutions-INO/presentation.asp  \n4  The increased international oil prices drove the state energy company's costs from $0.06 per kilowatt-hour in 2004 \nto $0.12 per kilowatt-hour in 2008, prompting the government to provide it with a subsidy of $6.5 billion.  \n5  The state power company no longer has access to subsidized fuel, thus encouraging the development of other \nenergy sources, and subsidies on high-grade gasoline for vehicles have been eliminated. Presidential regulation \nno. 5/2006 aims to revise the energy mix in 2025, with oil dropping from 52% to 20%, gas at 30%, coal at 33%, and \nnew and renewable energy sources at 17%. \n ", "4 \nto amount to $300 million, including replacement with highly efficient motors and variable speed \ndrives,  heat  loss  reduction,  lighting,  chiller  optimization,  furnace  and  boiler  improvements, \ntransformer replacement, and controlling leaks in cooling and steam systems.   \n \n14.  Growing  awareness  in  the  exporting  community  of  international  contract \nrequirements on emission standards. At present, exporters under contract or seeking to \nestablish purchase agreements with overseas buyers in North America or the European Union \n(e.g.,  Walmart,  Carrefour,  or  Pier  1  Imports)  are  highly  aware  of  ISO  market  compliance \nrequirements as well as standards on emissions of carbon dioxide. However, the supply of \nappropriate financial and advisory services lags behind demand, as commercial banks have \nvery limited knowledge of energy efficiency financing solutions developed internationally, and \nlittle capacity to analyze or evaluate their clients\u2019 energy efficiency projects. Energy service \ncompanies are few and their services not widely understood.  \n \n15.  ISO 50001\u2014the new energy management standard applied to exports. The ISO has \nidentified  energy  management  as  a  priority  to  save  energy  and  reduce  greenhouse  gas \nemissions worldwide. The ISO 50001 energy management standard, to be introduced in 2011, \nwill provide organizations and companies with strategies to improve energy efficiency, reduce \ncosts, and improve environmental performance. Conformance with the energy management \nstandard  will  demonstrate  that  the  company  has  (i)  implemented  sustainable  energy \nmanagement  systems,  (ii)  completed  a  baseline  of  energy  use  and  energy  audit,  and               \n(iii) committed to continuously reducing its energy intensity. The standard will be compatible with \nthe  widely  used  ISO  9001  on  quality  management  and  ISO  14001  on  environmental \nmanagement. The ISO expects the standard to be implemented by major trading corporations, \ninternational supply chains, utilities, and energy service companies to reduce their facilities\u2019 \nenergy intensity and carbon emissions. In Indonesia, both direct and indirect exporters will \ntherefore need to consider retrofitting factories to retain access to international markets and \nsupply chains where ISO 50001 will regulate product entry.  \n \n16.  Export credit agencies and the delivery of energy efficiency finance. Across middle-\nincome and transitional economies, energy efficiency finance has most often been initiated by \nECAs, whose pioneering roles in responding to market demand and facilitating access to new \ninternational technologies not yet commercialized in the domestic market, through term trade \nfinance  and  leveraging  significant  opportunities  for  financing  energy  efficiency,  are  well \ndocumented. International development partners with established policies on mitigating climate \nchange  and  conserving  energy  have  worked  with  ECAs  in  transitional  and  middle-income \neconomies to implement programs for energy efficiency finance. The mandate of ECAs is to \nprovide financial products that fill a market gap and spread them across the financial sector \nusing risk-sharing agreements with participating commercial banks, as per OECD risk-sharing \nguidelines.  ECAs  are  thus  ideally  positioned  to  be  the  first  providers  of  energy  efficiency \nfinance\u2014i.e., financial products in response to exporter demand for energy efficiency retrofits. \nExamples of market-based finance programs for energy efficiency developed for ECAs by \ninternational financial institutions include the (i) Thai Eximbank\u2019s Revolving Fund for Energy \nEfficiency, initiated in 2000 and currently the recipient of up to $3.1 billion from the World Bank \nClean Technology Fund; (ii) Eximbank of Ukraine\u2019s $50 million loan from the European Bank for \nReconstruction and Development (with a 2-year grace period and 7-year term financing) to \nfinance  medium-  and  long-term  energy  efficiency  projects  by  which  Ukrainian  enterprises \nreduce their energy intensity; (iii) the China Eximbank Energy Efficiency Finance Project funded \nby the International Finance Corporation (IFC) in 2007, the World Bank in 2008, and the Japan \nBank for International Cooperation (JBIC) in 2009 to facilitate large energy efficiency loan \nprograms  for  China  Eximbank;  and  (iv)  India  Eximbank\u2019s  2009  climate  change  mitigation ", "                    5\nprogram, funded through a European Investment Bank loan of \u20ac150 million, to facilitate the \nimport of equipment for energy efficiency and renewable energy projects in India.  \n \nC.  Investment Identification and Selection \n17.  ADB  undertook  initial  due  diligence  on  the  major  state-owned  commercial  banks, \nincluding the largest of the 26 regional banks, over May\u2013October 2009. It held comprehensive \nconsultations with 10 major industry associations to review corporate and SME demand for \nproducts  financing  energy  efficiency.  In  response  to  the  request  of  industry  and  senior \ngovernment stakeholders, ADB held a conference to raise awareness in commercial banks, \nregulatory agencies, and the productive sector on the range of energy efficiency financing \nsolutions introduced by commercial banks in Asia and the Pacific (footnote 3). ADB learned that \n(i) energy efficient technologies are not yet commercialized in Indonesia; (ii) exporter demand \nfor energy efficiency finance is currently not met; and (iii) the newly established Indonesia \nEximbank has the strongest appetite to move forward with ADB on deepening access to trade \nfinance and pioneering financing for energy efficiency on behalf of exporters.  \n \n18.  Transaction design. The proposed loans and TA are : \n(i)   a $100 million A-loan, of which $30 million will be earmarked for energy efficiency \nand $70 million used to facilitate access for Indonesia Eximbank\u2019s clients (up to \n90% for corporations and 10% for SMEs)6 to term US dollar trade finance, \nworking capital, and refinancing to shortening the maturity of high-interest loans \ntaken during the financial crisis, among other things;  \n(ii)   a  $100  million  B-loan  on  a  best-efforts  basis  to  help  Indonesia  Eximbank \novercome  the  financing  gap  for  US  dollar  term  lending  and  meet  exporter \ndemand for term trade finance and working capital; and  \n(iii)  $1.45 million for capacity development TA.  \n \n19.  The objective of the multipurpose loans and TA is to improve access to ECA finance and \ninsurance and pioneer financing for energy efficiency in Indonesia through Indonesia Eximbank, \nto (i) facilitate term financing for exporters\u2019 energy efficiency retrofits; and to (ii) catalyze energy \nefficiency financing by domestic banks. The TA will help Indonesia Eximbank to finance energy \nefficiency and roll out the program on a sustainable basis in a manner that considers high initial \ntransaction  costs  and  is  consistent  with  other  international  financial  institutions\u2019  pricing \nmethodology for financing energy efficiency in Asia and the Pacific. In developing the pilot \ninvestment  for  financing  energy  efficiency,  ADB  has  been  closely  guided  by  regular \nconsultations with Indonesia Eximbank\u2019s management and existing client base, including site \nvisits with loan officers to major exporters. The $30 million pilot investment will abide by ADB \nProcurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time).7 \n \nD.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 \n20.  Inclusive  economic  growth.  The  loan  provides  much-needed  term  financing  for \nIndonesia\u2019s exporting corporations and direct and indirect SME exporters. The major export \n                                                 \n6  Refer to the Ministry of Finance restriction explained in para. 35.  \n7  Specifically section 3.12 on procurement for loans to financial intermediaries. \n ", "6 \nsectors of garments, textiles, rubber, and palm oil play vital roles in economic development \nbecause of the wide geographic spread of production and its labor intensity at each stage.  \n \n21.  Environmentally  sustainable  development.  The  loans  and  TA  will  support  ADB's \nEnergy Policy (2009) objectives in Indonesia by helping Indonesia Eximbank to facilitate term \nfinancing to support SME and corporate energy efficiency project pipelines and thereby raise \nawareness among Indonesia's financial institutions of how to finance energy efficiency to reduce \nenergy input costs and shrink the carbon footprint of Indonesian products. \n  \n2.  Consistency with the Country Strategy \n22.  The nonsovereign investment is listed in the country operations business plan (COBP), \n2011\u20132013 as a $100 million loan processed by the Southeast Asia Department.8 The COBP is \nconsistent  with  the  country  strategy  and  program  (CSP),  2006\u20132009  (2011\u20132015  being \nfinalized). The CSP aims to help the government achieve higher pro-poor sustainable growth \nand social development, with particular attention to governance and anticorruption measures in \nall operations, which are the objectives of the government\u2019s medium-term development plan for \n2010\u20132014. The CSP identifies five areas of engagement to reach these objectives: (i) better \ninfrastructure and infrastructure services, (ii) a deeper financial sector, (iii) more decentralized \ngovernment  functions,  (iv)  achieving  Millennium  Development  Goals,  and  (v)  more  robust \nmanagement of the environment and natural resources. Consultations with the government \nduring the country programming mission confirmed the validity of these strategies and their \nconsistency with the government\u2019s medium-term priorities and Strategy 2020.9 \n \n3.  Consistency with the Sector Strategy \n23.  With respect to clean energy and climate change, the COBP includes the new priorities \nof the government and ADB in energy efficiency and conservation in commercial enterprises, in \naddition to geothermal projects. \n \n4.  Lessons from Previous Operations \n24.  The  team  reviewed  the  processing  of  ADB\u2019s  nonsovereign  projects  with  the  India \nEximbank and the Private Sector Operations Department\u2019s implementation of energy efficiency \ninvestments in energy service companies and financial intermediaries in India and the People\u2019s \nRepublic  of  China.  The  team  reviewed  with  the  Regional  and  Sustainable  Development \nDepartment lessons learned from ADB\u2019s clean energy project pipeline and the World Bank\u2019s \nIndependent Evaluation Group report, which closely coordinates financial institutions, utility \ncompanies, and energy efficiency equipment suppliers.10 Lessons learned include the need for \nmore  additionality  from  banks\u2019  cautious  application  of  energy  efficiency  finance  models  in \nutilities, and the need to reorient subsidies to cover market failure.  \n \n                                                 \n8  Refer to ADB. 2010.

Consistency with Other Relevant ADB Operations \n25.  The investment builds on ADB's ongoing Trade Finance Program in Indonesia and \ncomplements ongoing and planned multitranche financing facility programs in the energy sector. \nIn  Southeast  Asia,  ADB  has  implemented  financial  policy  program  loans  to  support  fiscal \ndecentralization and has programmed both demand-side and supply-side solutions through \nenergy projects that will mainstream conservation in industry and support the development of \ngeothermal energy. \n \nE.  Development Impact \n26.  Impact.  The  investment  will  facilitate  expanded  access  to  term  trade  finance  and \nworking capital and the refinancing of high-interest loans taken during the financial crisis by \nIndonesia  Eximbank,  thereby  benefitting  Indonesia\u2019s  corporate  and  SME  exporters  and \nsupporting export-led employment. The nonsovereign loan will pioneer energy efficiency finance \nin Indonesia, with the support of TA, to meet exporter demand for energy efficiency retrofits and \nrelated equipment upgrades to comply with ISO 50001 and support the national development \nagenda on mainstreaming climate change adaptation and mitigation (Appendix 1).  \n \n1.  Contribution to Economic Growth and Poverty Reduction \n27.  The  recent  world  recession  underscored  the  importance  of  trade  to  employment, \nparticularly in labor-intensive, export-led manufacturing. The G-20 stance on supporting credit \nfor exporters highlighted the strategic role of ECAs toward achieving national objectives on job \ncreation.  A  recent  study  by  ADB  and  the  Asian  Development  Bank  Institute, Poverty  and \nSustainable Development in Asia: Impacts and Responses to the Global Economic Crisis, and, \nin particular, the analysis by Papanek, Basri, and Schydlowsky on the Impact of the World \nRecession on Indonesia and an Appropriate Policy Response,11 suggest that Indonesia should \nenhance the competitiveness of its labor-intensive, export-led sectors, including palm oil, textiles \nand garments, and manufacturing, to alleviate poverty. As 1 million Indonesians work in the \ntextile and garment sector, ADB\u2019s investment in Indonesia Eximbank and the accompanying TA \nto support large labor-intensive corporations and improve their competitiveness through term \ntrade and finance for energy efficiency directly supports government objectives on poverty \nalleviation (Appendix 2).  \n \n  2.   Private Sector Development \n \n28.  The  investment  and  TA  fully  support  developing  institutional  capacity  in  Indonesia \nEximbank to establish risk-sharing agreements on trade finance with domestic commercial \nbanks, which will demonstrate energy efficiency finance for banks to replicate. In addition, TA \nwill  strengthen  the  advisory  services  of  Indonesia  Eximbank  and  facilitate  workshops  for \nindustry and banks on energy efficiency investments for ISO 50001 compliance and the use of \nrelated products to finance energy efficiency.  \n \n                                                 \n11  G.

Outputs and Outcome \n29.  The key outputs of ADB's investment will be the expanded volume of ECA finance \nproducts and Indonesia Eximbank\u2019s pioneering of energy efficiency finance. These products will \nspread across the banking sector through risk-sharing agreements. By acceding to the Berne \nUnion of international export credit insurers, with TA support from ADB, Indonesia Eximbank is \nexpected to further strengthen its range of products and advisory services. The outcome will be \nimproved access to ECA finance and insurance for corporate and SME exporters, with the pilot \ninvestment in financing energy efficiency raising exporters\u2019 awareness of ISO 50001 compliance \nrequirements through coordinated financial products, energy audits, and appropriate technology \nimports to support retrofitting.  \n \nF.  Unique Features \n30.   The investment will pioneer energy efficiency finance in Indonesia and raise awareness \nof ISO 50001 compliance and its impact on exporter competitiveness. The TA will coordinate \nwith  the  ongoing  initiative  of  the  Regional  and  Sustainable  Development  Department  on \nrenewable energy in Indonesia and review the results of the department\u2019s study with Indonesia \nEximbank. ADB TA indicates that palm oil mill waste has potential for reducing greenhouse gas \nemissions while generating power from a renewable resource and providing clean electricity to \n4 million rural households.12 \n      \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The ADB Assistance and Transaction Structure \n31.  The proposed transaction will provide a US dollar-denominated direct loan (A-loan) of up \nto $100 million for up to 5 years to Indonesia Eximbank and a complementary loan (B-loan) of \nup to $100 million for up to 3 years to Indonesia Eximbank, both without guarantee from the \nGovernment of Indonesia. It will further provide TA in an amount of $1.45 million to facilitate the \nfinancing of energy efficiency by Indonesia Eximbank and support the ECA\u2019s development of \nSME trade finance and insurance products, as well as its accession to the Berne Union. Based \non risk rating, the proposed A-loan of up to $100 million, including commitment and front-end \nfees, will have an obligor risk rating of NSO7 and a facility risk rating of NSO7, to take into \naccount the tenor of the A-loan. The A-loan will be allocated in a manner to facilitate the prudent \nexpansion of the ECA\u2019s portfolio, as follows: (i) $30 million for term lending for energy efficiency \nprojects; (ii) $35 million for new lending, of which at least $20 million will be allocated to new \nclients or new projects and $15 million will increase working capital for existing clients; and \n(iii) $35 million  for  refinancing  loans  issued  mostly  during  the  financial  crisis.  The  ECA  is \nexpected to allocate up to 90% of the funds to corporate exporters and the growing balance to \nSMEs. \n \n32.   The proposed B-loan of up to $100 million with a 3-year term, granted under ADB's \nfunded risk participation scheme, will be funded by international banks on a best-efforts basis \nwith terms and conditions to be mutually agreed by the borrower, participating banks, and ADB. \nADB  has  negotiated  with  JBIC  to  sign  a  project-specific,  collaborative  memorandum  of \nunderstanding whereby the ADB loans and JBIC\u2019s nonsovereign loan of up to $100 million are \n                                                 \n12  ADB. 2007. Completion Report: Gas Generation from Waste. Project in Indonesia. Manila (TA4333-INO) ", "                    9\nto be processed in parallel. The transaction will provide diversified funding sources and thus \nhelp the ECA to broaden its developmental mandate, particularly in green banking.  \n \n33.   To help Indonesia Eximbank scale up energy efficiency financing, it is proposed that \nADB provide up to $30 million as part of the A-loan to pilot energy efficiency finance, in \nresponse  to  existing  client  demand  and  ADB\u2019s  assessment  of  future  demand  for  energy \nefficiency finance in the export sector. All proposed loans will be unsecured, based on the \nstrength of Indonesia Eximbank's balance sheet. \n \nB.  Justification for ADB Assistance \n34.  The foreign currency loans provided to Indonesia Eximbank are to facilitate its term \nfinancing at a time when a downturn in Japan and the United States caused by sovereign debt \nproblems in Europe, as well as increasing world oil prices, represent major external risks. \nCapital flight would likely hit the equity and bond markets, as foreign investors are major players \nin the Indonesian capital markets. European banks' loans to Indonesian banks are estimated at \n$33 billion (6% of GDP); reducing them would raise funding costs and restrict the availability of \nterm funds for Indonesian borrowers. \n \n35.  The loans and TA will help Indonesia Eximbank sustainably implement its strategic plan, \nspecifically supporting management's objectives to diversify portfolio growth by facilitating US \ndollar term trade finance, working capital, and refinancing, including shortening the maturity of \nhigh-interest  loans  taken  during  the  financial  crisis,  to  reduce  the  financial  burden  on \nIndonesia\u2019s exporters and provide energy efficiency finance to corporate exporters and SMEs \nthat export directly or indirectly. The TA will work with the new ECA to enable more proactive \nSME  lending,  including,  as  may  be  required,  representation  to  the  Ministry  of  Finance  to \ndemonstrate the viability of other ECA trade finance products developed for SMEs. As indicated \nin para. 27, corporate lending in labor-intensive sectors directly supports the government\u2019s \nobjective of poverty alleviation.   \n \nC.  Risks and Mitigation Measures \n36.  The main risks to the proposed transactions and the mitigating measures are as follows:  \n \n(i)  Government Support.  Indonesian Eximbank\u2019s stand-alone creditworthiness is \nunderpinned by explicit and implicit support from the Indonesian government, \nincluding  100%  government  ownership  and  the  MOF\u2019s  Rp4  trillion  keepwell \ncommitment.    Loan  covenants  covering  any  material  change  in  Indonesia \nEximbank\u2019s charter law, particularly its ownership structure and the government\u2019s \ncommitment to maintain minimum capital of Rp4 trillion, provide key structural \nprotections for ADB, including the right to terminate the facility.  \n \n(ii)  Pioneering  Energy  Efficiency  Financing.    Indonesia  Eximbank  provides \nequipment financing in response to exporter demand for new technology.  ADB's \ncapacity  development  TA  will  facilitate  the  active  involvement  of  technical \nconsultants to support initial EE financing projects in coordination with Energy \nService Companies that are increasingly active in Indonesia.  \n \n(iii)  Vigorous Business Strategy.  Indonesia Eximbank has recently upgraded its \nrisk management system and expanded its risk management division tasked to \nreview all credit proposals above Rp2 trillion.  In addition, Indonesia Eximbank \n ", "10 \nhas expanded the number of corporate loan officers, which should help meet its \nbusiness development targets. \n \n(iv)  Risk  Management  System.    Indonesia  Eximbank  does  not  have  a  Credit \nCommittee but instead has several approval hierarchies.  All loans above $20 \nmillion  are  subject  to  Board  approval.    The  bank  recently  upgraded  its  risk \nmanagement  system  and  expanded  its  risk  management  division  tasked  to \nreview all credit proposals with amounts higher than Rp2 trillion. In addition, each \ntransaction is submitted for committee review and approval, including loans in an \namount as low as $200,000.   \n \n(v)   Portfolio  Structure. Indonesia Eximbank\u2019s asset quality has been adversely \nimpacted by the global financial crisis.  However, NPLs are concentrated in two \nmajor  accounts,  which  are  now  being  managed  through  restructuring  and \nlitigation.  While the bank\u2019s 20 largest customers account for 54% of its total loan \nportfolio (19% comprised of SOEs) as of Q3 2010, its NPLs are being closely \nmonitored by the MOF.  Furthermore, Indonesia Eximbank\u2019s strong capitalization \nshould be more than sufficient to absorb any losses.   \n \n(vi)  Refinancing  Risk.    Indonesia  Eximbank\u2019s  ability  to  manage  its  future  debt \nmaturity profile is increasingly mitigated by the bank\u2019s access to the growing \ndomestic capital markets and bilateral long-term funding from foreign commercial \nbanks. \n \n(vii)   Regulatory Risk.  Indonesia Eximbank is a special legal entity.  The Minister of \nFinance acts as the supervisor of Indonesia Eximbank.  Under its separate legal \nAct,  Indonesia  Eximbank  is  guided  by  prudential  regulations  that  must  be \ncomplied with and for which it is accountable to the Minister of Finance as well as \nParliament. Therefore, it is in the interest of both government and Indonesia \nEximbank to ensure a healthy portfolio as this will have a strong bearing on the \nbank\u2019s international credit rating. \n \n(viii)  Currency Risk.  ADB's loan to Indonesia Eximbank will be denominated in US \ndollars but will be onlent to exporters, importers, and indirect exporters with a \nnatural hedge.   \n \nD.  Technical Assistance  \n37.  The  TA  is  classified  as  capacity  development  TA,  category  B.  It  will  (i) review  the \nIndonesia  Eximbank  portfolio  and  identify  existing  transactions  that  will  allow  for  energy \nefficiency finance; (ii) assess energy efficiency potential against the current and target client \nbase of Indonesia Eximbank; (iii) develop a loan pipeline for Indonesia Eximbank in consultation \nwith relationship managers for corporate finance and SMEs; (iv) undertake investment-grade \nenergy audits to identify energy saving and energy efficiency investment requirements for each \nsubsector; (v) develop a marketing campaign and training seminars on energy efficiency finance \nproducts for exporters and industry associations in line with client survey results; (vi) work with \nIndonesia  Eximbank  to  develop  additional  SME  trade  finance  and  insurance  products; \n(vii) assist with risk premium calibration; and (viii) assist with Indonesia Eximbank\u2019s accession to \nthe Berne Union. The TA of up to $1.45 million will be cofinanced on a grant basis by the Asian ", "                    11\nClean Energy Fund13 under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility ($1,100,000) and \nthe Financial Sector Development Partnership Fund ($350,000).14 The description of the TA \nfinancing plan and the consultants terms of reference are in Appendix 6. \nIV.   POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Environment and Social Safeguards   \n38.  ADB\u2019s investment in Indonesia Eximbank is classified as category financial intermediary \nin terms of its impacts on the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples, as \nper the due diligence requirements set out in Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). Indonesia \nEximbank will be required to establish an appropriate environmental and social management \nsystem (ESMS) to meet national laws and ADB\u2019s requirements. Subprojects and activities will \nbe screened against ADB\u2019s list of prohibited investments. ADB will coordinate with Indonesia \nEximbank to ensure that the ESMS is revised and cleared by ADB and applied to all subprojects \nand activities under both the A-loan and the B-loan. \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n39.  Quarterly  and  annual  reports.  Indonesia Eximbank will provide to ADB unaudited \nsemiannual and audited annual reports including financial statements. ADB will review this \ninformation  and  follow  up  with  Indonesia  Eximbank  as  appropriate  to  clarify  where  more \ninformation is needed. To the extent that the information received from Indonesia Eximbank \npoints to issues that could impair the value of ADB's investment in it, ADB will decide whether to \nput the investment on the watch list for more frequent review and closer attention. \n \n40.  Nonfinancial monitoring. Indonesia Eximbank will be required to submit its ESMS to \nADB and to report annually to ADB on environmental and social safeguard issues. The account \nofficer will request the ESMS and the annual reviews as appropriate and work with staff to \nensure that these documents meet ADB's standards. \n \n41.  The aforementioned tools will keep ADB in close contact with Indonesia Eximbank. \n \nC.  Anticorruption Policy  \n42.  Indonesia Eximbank was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to \ndate) and Policy on Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism (2003). \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will \nrequire Indonesia Eximbank to institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and \ncontrols following international best practice standards for the purpose of preventing corruption \nor money laundering activities or the financing of terrorism and covenant with ADB to refrain \nfrom engaging in such activities. The investment documentation between ADB and Indonesia \nEximbank will further allow ADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these \nundertakings. \n \n                                                 \n13 Established by the Government of Japan.

The proposed loan will be within the midterm, country, industry, group, and single project \nexposure limit for nonsovereign investments. \n \nE.  Assurances \n44.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \nGovernment of Indonesia will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed \nassistance  to  Indonesia  Eximbank.  No  funding  will  be  disbursed  until  ADB  receives  such \nconfirmation.  ADB  will  enter  into  suitable  finance  documentation,  in  form  and  substance \nsatisfactory to ADB, following approval of the proposed assistance by the Board of Directors.  \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n45.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve (i) the A-loan of up to \n$100,000,000 to Indonesia Eximbank from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources with such other \nterms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in this report, and \nas may be reported to the Board; and (ii) the B-loan of up to $100,000,000 to Indonesia \nEximbank to be funded by commercial banks, on terms and conditions agreed among ADB, \nIndonesia Eximbank, and the B-loan participating banks, with such other terms and conditions \nas are substantially in accordance with those set forth in this report, and as may be reported to \nthe Board.  \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda  \nPresident \n25 March 2011", "Appendix 1  13 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \nPerformance  Data Sources/Reporting \nDesign Summary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   Assumptions and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nIndonesia  Indonesia Eximbank  Bank Indonesia and  Rapid growth in ECA \nEximbank\u2019s trade  increases available  Ministry of Finance  credit and insurance does \nand energy  financing from 1% to 2%  statistics  not impair prudent \nefficiency financing  on behalf of national    behavior. \nincreases.  exports, by 2018.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA. Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) investment in Indonesia Eximbank supports government policy regarding \ninclusive growth and employment generation through private sector development.  \n \nIndonesian President Bambang Yudhoyono revealed, while preparing for the 2010 United Nations summit on the \nMillennium Development Goals, his government\u2019s new development plan, which emphasizes poverty reduction as \none of the administration\u2019s four key economic policies (the other three being supporting economic growth, job \ncreation, and protecting the environment). The report forecasts gross domestic product growth of 6.0% by the end of \n2010, up from 4.5% in 2009. The report estimates that 52% of Indonesia\u2019s 221 million people live on less than \n$2/day. Of  those, 35 million (16%) live on less than $0.65/day, the Indonesian poverty line. The number of near poor, \nor those at risk of becoming poor if they lose a single month\u2019s income, is estimated to be 115 million. The investment \nis consistent with the country program and strategy, which indicates ADB\u2019s support to the government for quicker \nachievement of the MDGs as a major area of engagement.  \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                 Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n1. Key Issues  \n \nIndonesia\u2019s strategy to reduce poverty emphasizes absorbing low-skilled labor into productive sectors. This project \ncontributes to this strategy by raising awareness of a new international standard, International Organization for \nStandardization (ISO) 50001, and developing energy efficiency finance products to make labor-intensive exporters \nmore competitive. An additional 5,000\u20138,000 jobs can be created during the project, with 20% of them estimated to \ngo to people below the $2 poverty line.  \n \nThe project is classified as a general intervention. While it has some poverty reduction impact by generating \nemployment in labor-intensive exporters in industries included in Indonesia Eximbank\u2019s portfolio, it does not directly \naddress poverty reduction. As 50% of Indonesia Eximbank\u2019s portfolio is in manufacturing\u2014with garments and textiles, \nfood processing, and furnishings being labor intensive\u2014and the other 50% is in high-capital and labor-intensive \nsectors such as commodities, the project has employment benefits estimated at 5,000\u20138,000 additional jobs if ADB\u2019s \n$100 million nonsovereign loan is allocated evenly between labor-intensive and other export production. The project \nbases these projections on the methodology outlined in Appendix 4, Table A5.2. Capacity development technical \nassistance will monitor the employment impact of the ADB intervention. \n \n2. Design Features. The project will target labor-intensive exporters in Indonesia Eximbank\u2019s portfolio, including \nthose in palm oil, garments and textiles, food processing, and furniture manufacturing. The supporting TA will closely \ncoordinate  with the Regional and Sustainable Development Department on ADB\u2019s Energy for All Initiative in \nIndonesia, which aims to increase poor households\u2019 access to energy. ADB technical assistance in 2006, Gas \nGeneration from Waste, concluded that improved waste management in palm oil mills offer potential for generating \npower from a renewable resource and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This palm oil waste\u2014empty fruit \nbunches, mesocarp fibers, shells, palm oil effluent, and methane rising from it\u2014is capable of generating 230,530 \nterajoules per year of clean electricity to at least 4 million rural households. Indonesia Eximbank has shown interest in \nreviewing the outcome of the study, offering scope for increasing collaboration with ADB's Energy for All Initiative to \ndevelop and provide innovative financing for energy access. Maximizing access to energy for the region's poor is a \npillar in ADB's 2009 Energy Policy and the aim of the regional technical assistance Empowering the Poor through \nIncreasing Access to Energy.  \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \nKey Issues. The key issues are to ensure that the enterprises financed under this project are in sectors that have \npotential to generate additional employment. As indicated in the report and recommendation of the President, 50% of \nIndonesia Eximbank\u2019s existing loan portfolio is in manufacturing, which includes the labor-intensive production of \ngarments and textiles, processed food, and furnishings. \n \n ", "                  Appendix 2  17\nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1. Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nDiscussions were held with 10 major industry associations (including those in garments and textiles, food processing, \nfurnishings, footwear, etc.) and the Chamber of Commerce, the Bankers\u2019 Association, and senior government \nofficials, including those representing the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Trade, Ministry of State-Owned Enterprises, \nand Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources. Export-led employment issues were reviewed with the Ministry of \nTrade, which is represented on the Board of Indonesia Eximbank. \n \n2. What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n   Information sharing     Consultation     Collaborative decision making    Empowerment \n \n3. Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes    No  \n \nC. Gender and Development \nKey Issues. Manufacturing exporters to be financed under the project, both corporate and smaller enterprises, are \nmostly urban. Technical assistance will therefore assist in monitoring the implementation of ADB\u2019s environment and \nsocial management systems, as well as report on the impact of the project in remote areas in coordination with \nRegional and Sustainable Development Department\u2019s Energy for All Initiative, and work with a national consultant to \nmonitor the project\u2019s impact on employing women, in particular, in garments, textiles, and food products for export. \n2.

The authors indicated on page 36 that \"regaining the 0.5% market share that Indonesia once had would \nincrease Indonesia's textiles and garment exports by $3 billion a year, adding roughly 750,000 workers as the world market grows. The same factors that \nwould enable Indonesia to regain its share of the textiles and garment market would also apply to its share of the furniture and shoe markets. In 2008, \nIndonesia exported some $36 billion of miscellaneous manufactured products, up from $9 billion in 1996. While some required few workers (fertilizers, \nchemicals, [and] iron and steel), others employed a substantial number of unskilled workers (for production of toys, kitchenware, and plastic products). \nExpanding agricultural products, aside from established palm oil exports, also represent a big potential: fresh fruit, flowers, and some vegetables as well as \ntraditional products such as rubber, spices, and beverages can also be grown and provide jobs. These products have grown from $5.5 billion to $14.5 billion \nover the period 1996\u20132008.\" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "                                                                 Appendix 5   25 \nADB DEMAND ESTIMATES FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY IN SUPPORT OF THE                                  \nINDONESIA EXIMBANK NONSOVEREIGN INVESTMENT  \n \n1.  The  review  of  other  programs  to  finance  energy  efficiency  implemented  with  donor \nsupport by commercial banks in Asia and the Pacific, as well as in transitional economies, \nindicates that a case-by-case analysis of the commercial bank\u2019s existing portfolio and market \nniche, as well as the domestic and international regulatory environment guiding commercial \nenterprises, are major determinants for successfully implementing energy efficiency finance. The \nstudy undertaken by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) project team from March to June 2010, \nwith support from the Regional and Sustainable Development Department, has identified the \nfollowing  factors  as  ensuring  the  sustainable  development  of  Indonesia  Eximbank\u2019s  energy \nefficiency finance portfolio: \n(i)  Exporters have the strongest motivation to take energy efficiency finance in light of \nstiffening requirements from European Union and North American distributors that \ntheir overseas suppliers to provide carbon footprint data. \n(ii)  The  government  increased  the  electricity  tariff  in  July  2010,  thus  creating  an \nenabling environment for energy efficiency finance. The project will target those \ncustomers that use electricity as a primary energy source (as opposed to liquefied \nnatural  gas  or  other  forms  of  cheaper  power)  and  specialize  in  production \nprocesses that are energy intensive. \n(iii)  As energy efficient technologies are not yet commercialized in Indonesia, trade \nfinance must facilitate the import of appropriate technology from overseas.  \n(iv)  Financing will be provided initially to exporters with a natural foreign currency \nhedge  (i.e.,  exporters  using  imported  technology  to  manufacture  products  for \nexport). \n(v)  Transaction will range in size from $200,000 to $5 million to ensure that loans \ntarget those exporters without ready access to other funding sources. For larger \nloans, vendor financing is available at competitive rates. For example, large palm \noil processors have access to equipment financing from WestLB at the London \ninterbank offered rate plus 250 basis points, with a tenor of 6\u20138 years. \n(vi)  The project will avoid transactions that are too large for a distributing bank such as \nIndonesia Eximbank to process. \n \n2.  The  project  will  (i)  review  the  Indonesia  Eximbank  portfolio  and  identify  existing \ntransactions that allow for energy efficiency finance, (ii) assess energy efficiency potential against \nthe  current  and  target  client  base  of  Indonesia  Eximbank,  (iii)  develop  a  loan  pipeline  for \nIndonesia Eximbank in consultation with relationship managers for corporate finance and small \nand medium-sized enterprises), (iv) undertake investment-grade energy audits to identify the \nenergy saving and energy efficiency investment requirements of each subsector, and (v) develop \na marketing campaign and training seminars reflecting the results of the client survey of exporters \nand industry associations for the energy efficiency finance product. \n \n3.  Indonesia Eximbank has the following major advantages for initiating energy efficiency \nfinance: \n(i)  It is familiar with the target customer base in Indonesia and the major international \nsuppliers of energy efficient technologies because of its focus as an export credit \nagency (ECA) on trade. \n(ii)  As its loan portfolio is $1.4 billion, the proposed $30 million energy efficiency \nfinance component is a 2% increase over current loan portfolio. \n ", "26     Appendix 5 \n \n(iii)  The potential to expand the energy efficiency finance portfolio up to $100 million, \ngiven  estimated  market  size  of  at  least  $300  million  for  commercial  energy \nefficiency finance, would be less than 10% of current portfolio.  \n(iv)  Relationship managers have the potential to absorb the heavier workload, as there \nare now 150 customers serviced by 37 relationship managers. \n(v)  Indonesia Eximbank is growing and strongly motivated, as the energy efficiency \nfinance program will help the ECA to expand the range of its product offering, build \nexpertise in energy efficiency finance, and increase its available funds.  \n \n4.  ADB\u2019s project team has initially assessed how Indonesia\u2019s largest export sectors fit with \nthe target customer criteria. Solid potential to develop an energy efficiency lending pipeline exists \nin the following sectors, which have shown modest growth and are labor intensive: (i) paper, \npaperboard, and articles; (ii) textile yarns, fabrics, and made-up articles; (iii) furniture and furniture \nparts; and (iv) clothing. With respect to the quickly growing iron and steel sector, the supporting \ntechnical assistance will further review the industry structure to determine the scope of energy \nefficiency finance for both direct and indirect exporters. \n \n5.  Textiles accounted for $10 billion in exports in 2010. Assuming energy efficiency savings \nin the range of 10%\u201320%, the potential savings on energy costs are from $64 million to $120 \nmillion. This is derived by assuming a 20% profit margin in the industry, which gives estimated \nannual costs of $8 billion per year; electricity is 8% of total costs, or $640 million, so savings from \nenergy efficient technology are 10%\u201320%, or $64 million\u2013$120 million.  \n \n6.

Description \n \n1.  The technical assistance (TA) will facilitate the development of new financing instruments \nand related advisory services to improve energy efficiency in manufacturing and thus facilitate \nIndonesian  exporters'  compliance  with  International  Organization  for  Standardization  (ISO) \n50001, to be introduced in 2011, and energy conservation in Indonesia. The TA will improve the \ntargeting of trade finance and insurance instruments for Indonesian small and medium-sized \n(SME) exporters. It will be implemented from May 2011 to November 2012. To support the \nimplementation of energy efficiency finance, the TA will use 20 person-months of international \nconsulting services and 48 person-months of national consulting services. To implement risk-\nsharing agreements on export credit finance and insurance, including the expansion of the SME \nportfolio,  and  to  review  factoring  under  development,  the  TA  will  use  9  person-months  of \ninternational consulting services. \n \n2.  The TA will be timely and groundbreaking by building capacity for energy efficiency and \nconservation. It will support the following activities of Indonesia Eximbank's finance department \nand advisory services unit: (i) developing a campaign to raise awareness of the benefits of energy \nefficiency for Indonesian exporters, industry associations, and commercial banks; (ii) developing \ncapacity  for  evaluating  energy  efficiency  projects  in  the  export  credit  agency  (ECA)  and \nestablishing supporting credit review standards for such projects; (iii) developing appropriate pre-\nexport finance shipment guarantees for small projects and SMEs; (iv) reducing transaction costs \nfor developing sustainable energy investments through energy audits, feasibility studies, and \nsupporting  project  preparation  for  industries  and  participating  commercial  banks;  (v)  raising \nawareness in the government and providing high-level policy inputs to the Ministry of Finance and \nBank of Indonesia regarding commercial banks\u2019 mainstreaming of energy efficiency finance.  \n \n3.  The TA will provide capacity development and training to facilitate sustainable program \ndevelopment, specifically for SMEs and corporations. It will (i) facilitate the strengthening of \nIndonesia Eximbank trade finance, insurance and guarantee instruments in a manner that fully \ncomplies with the regulations established by the Berne Union of export credit and insurance \nagencies and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD); (ii) provide \nguidance  toward  Indonesia  Eximbank\u2019s  accession  to  the  Berne  Union  and  its  signing  of  a \nmemorandum  of  understanding  with  the  Multilateral  Investment  Guarantee  Agency,  thus \nfacilitating (a) the mutual recognition of trade credit and insurance instruments with international \nECAs, (b) more accessible trade finance and insurance modalities for Indonesian exporters in the \nOECD, and (c) expanded South\u2013South trade; (iii) provide on-site training to Indonesia Eximbank \nstaff  on  managing  risk  in  new  and  expanded  finance,  insurance,  and  guarantee  facilities;            \n(iv) provide on-site training to Indonesia Eximbank staff on marketing new and expanded credit \nand insurance instruments to commercial banks, with a view to expanding the outreach of official \ntrade credit and insurance to SMEs nationally. \n \n4.  To provide enough flexibility in the project and to align it with Indonesia Eximbank\u2019s \nrequirements, individual consultants and a consulting firm are anticipated to be engaged.
