INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of the Philippines requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nsupport Teach for the Philippines (TFP) in the implementation of a strategy to recruit teachers \nand  provide  them  with  training  in  modern  pedagogical  techniques,  including  the  use  of \nappropriate  technology.  ADB  worked  with  TFP\u2019s  predecessor,  Sa  Aklat  Sisikat  (SAS) \nFoundation, from 2010 to 2013 during the implementation of the Computer Access Mentorship \nProgram (CAMP), which offered an online program to improve the teaching of reading.1 The \nproposed technical assistance (TA) was discussed in detail with TFP and the Department of \nEducation (DepEd) in April 2014. The government concurred with the impact, outcome, outputs, \nimplementation  arrangements,  cost,  financing  arrangements,  and  terms  of  reference.  The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Despite good progress on education indicators during the 1990s and a high level of \ncommitment by the government to the Philippine National Education for All, 2015 plan and the \nMillennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs),  key  education  indicators  remain  well  below  MDG \ntargets.  The  country  is  unlikely  to  achieve  the  MDG  target  of  universal  access  to  basic \neducation by 2015.3 The education system faces both quality and access problems. Quality \nissues include large class sizes, poor teacher quality, insufficient teaching resources, congested \ncurriculum, and lack of subject specialist teachers. \n \n3.  The access problem includes a low secondary net enrollment rate\u201464.6% in school \nyear  (SY)  2012/13\u2014and  enrollment  disparities  across  regions  and  income  classes,  and \nbetween urban and rural populations. Enrollment rates vary widely across income quintiles: in \n2011,  the  secondary  school  net  enrollment  ratio  for  the  poorest  quintile  was  more  than \n35 percentage points below that of the richest quintile.4 School dropouts are highly concentrated \namong the poor and other disadvantaged groups. Despite recent increases, spending on basic \neducation is low relative to the size of the Philippines economy. In 2013, government spending \non education as a proportion of gross domestic product stood at 2.8%\u2014the same as in 2004. \n \n4.  DepEd figures show that the Philippines will need large numbers of teachers to remedy \ncurrent shortages and to meet the demands of the additional 2 years of senior high school \narising from the introduction of the K to 12 program.5 DepEd has already taken steps by hiring \nmore than 60,000 teachers in SY2013/14. Teacher quality is key to improving student learning \noutcomes, yet most public school teachers are ill-equipped, given the largely inadequate pre- \nand in-service training and professional development opportunities available to them. A recent \nstudy showed that only 16.7% of those who enrolled in teacher trainee colleges completed their \nprograms and 54% of Licensure Examination for Teachers (LET) takers passed the exam. The \nsame study found that, between October 2009 and September 2013, around 60% of tertiary \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2010.

Manila (July). \n5  The K to 12 program introduces kindergarten and two additional years of senior high school to what was a 10-year \neducation curriculum, thus lengthening the basic education system to 12 years. \n ", "2   \neducation institutions performed below their respective national passing rates on the LET, while \nonly 11% of tertiary institutions had at least 75% of their students pass the LET.6 \n \n5.  Shortages and poor teacher quality have contributed to declining student achievement. \nNational Achievement Test results of high school students from 2007 to 2010 show that the \nmean  percentage  score  dropped  from  49.3%  to  45.6%.  Negligible  gains  were  made  in \nelementary school scores. In the 2003 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study \n(the last time the country participated in an international assessment), the Philippines scored \nthird from the bottom in both science and mathematics. Of the 1.4 million grade 6 elementary \nstudents who took the High School Readiness Examination in 2004, also the last time this \nnationwide test was run, less than 1% managed a passing score in mathematics, English, and \nscience subjects.  \n \n6.  Girls\u2019 performance at the elementary and secondary education levels outpaces that of \nboys across a range of indicators, including net enrollment, completion, and school attendance.  \nGirls and women also make up a larger proportion of enrollments and have superior retention \nrates in higher education.7  However, girls\u2019 advantages at school do not translate into benefits \nlater  on\u2014women  still  have  a  much  lower  labor  force  participation  rate  than  men,  higher \ndomestic unemployment, and gender segregation by occupation, occupational group, and class \nof worker. Women\u2019s jobs are often in industries that are mainly informal. Women also suffer the \nmajority of gender-related discrimination.8 \n \n7.  The  TA  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2011\u20132016  for  the \nPhilippines, which emphasizes basic education, including supporting the implementation of the \ngovernment\u2019s flagship K to 12 program, which will extend the basic education cycle from 10 to \n12 years, effective from  SY2016/17. It also involves partnership between civil society, the \nprivate sector, and the government in supporting education. The TA will benefit from lessons \nlearned during the 2010\u20132013 CAMP TA, which was implemented in partnership with TFP\u2019s \npredecessor,  SAS  Foundation.  CAMP  developed  an  online  module  to  train  teachers  in \nprogressive strategies for teaching functional literacy in public elementary schools. \n \n8.  TFP took to heart a key lesson from the earlier TA\u2014while CAMP was successful in \nproviding the basic skills for teaching how to read, the need emerged to move toward providing \nmore  advanced  training  and  support  to  teachers,  using  more  innovative  information  and \ncommunication technologies and methods. This TA will develop an in-person teacher training \nprogram and online teacher training database that can expand and reorient the nature of \nsupport available for public school teachers, students, and teaching fellows nationwide. Its goal \nwill be to make resources, materials, and professional mentorship more accessible to teachers, \nas well as train teachers at a much more advanced level than was possible under the CAMP. \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact will be better learning outcomes, especially in functional literacy, among \nelementary  students  in  schools  supported  by  TFP.  The  outcome  will  be  a  scalable  and \n                                                \n6  Philippine Business for Education. 2014.

Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  This TA will help improve basic education by supporting TFP in the implementation of a \nstrategy to recruit teachers and provide them with training in modern pedagogical techniques, \nincluding the use of appropriate technology. TFP is a registered nongovernment organization in \nthe Philippines. It was established in August 2012 and is the successor organization to SAS \nFoundation, which was involved in upgrading the skills of public elementary teachers from 1999 \nto 2012. TFP is a member of the 34-partner Teach for All (TFA) country network, whose most \nprominent program partners include Teach for America in the United States and Teach First in \nthe United Kingdom. TFA also has Asian partners, including India, Japan, Malaysia, and the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China. \n \n11.  TFP recruits promising recent graduates and young professionals from the Philippines \nand the diaspora to teach (as teaching fellows) in high-need public schools for 2 years. Students \nare recruited from a pool of university graduates different from typical teacher trainees, and \nthrough a highly competitive selection process. Before beginning their 2-year engagement, \nstudents  undergo  intensive  2-month  training  in  the  TFP  Summer  Institute,  which  began \noperations in 2013. Students become teaching fellows once they have successfully completed \nthe TFP Summer Institute training. They receive training in progressive pedagogy, the country\u2019s \ncurriculum  requirements,  and  use  of  innovative  technologies.  Initially,  teaching  fellows  are \nplaced in schools in and around the National Capital Region. The first summer institute was held \nin April\u2013May 2013 and the first cohort of 53 teaching fellows began teaching in 10 high-need \nschools in Quezon City in June 2013. Schools were selected in concert with DepEd. \n \n12.  Currently, the focus of TFP is on the early elementary grades in high-density, poor urban \nareas.9 Over time, the TA will expand its focus to early elementary grades in rural communities \nand isolated island communities. Beyond 2015, it is expected that the TFP Summer Institute \nand support frameworks will become context- and region-specific, with the long-term goal to \nsupport the government\u2019s K to 12 program nationwide. To ensure sustainability and community \nengagement,  TFP  will  continue  to  work  closely  with  local  government  units,  who  pay  the \nsalaries of teaching fellows placed in schools within their jurisdiction. \n \n13.  The TA will deliver three outputs: (i) TFP Summer Institute strengthened, (ii) interactive \nonline system to support teaching fellows developed, and (iii) comprehensive monitoring and \nevaluation system established. These are outlined below.  \n \n1.  TFP Summer Institute Strengthened \n14.  This output will focus on the 2-month TFP Summer Institute that is used to train teaching \nfellows.  The  TA  will  strengthen  the  Summer  Institute  to  maximize  the  use  of  innovative \ntechnologies for the training and certification of teaching fellows. It will develop and make \navailable  online  teaching  materials  and  modules,  and  an  information-technology-based  in-\nservice training and support mechanism for teaching fellows. It will also assess Teach for \nAmerica\u2019s Teaching as Leadership curriculum and, where required, adapt it to the Philippines\u2019 \ncontext.  The  Teaching  as  Leadership  curriculum  will  be  examined  and,  where  required, \n                                                \n9  TFP is modelling the new grade 3 curriculum being introduced under the government\u2019s flagship education reform, \nthe K to 12 program. \n ", "4   \nstrengthened to ensure that it is gender-responsive and uses material and images that portray \ngirls and women in a favorable light and in nontraditional roles. \n \n15.  Partnerships with institutional leaders in teacher education in the Philippines will be \nidentified and supported through, for example, workshops and other learning events. Finally, \nthis output will finance the training of 120 teaching fellows over a 2-year period, with a focus on \nprogressive pedagogy and modern teaching methods. The number of TFP teaching fellows over \nthe TA period has been determined taking into account TFP\u2019s planned growth strategy and an \nassessment of its institutional capacity. \n \n2.  Interactive Online System to Support Teaching Fellows Developed \n16.  As part of its support framework, the TA will develop a gender-responsive online intranet \nand communications system to provide ongoing professional development and pedagogical \nsupport for TFP teaching fellows while they are undertaking their 2-year teaching engagement \nin  public  schools.  It  will  also  support  the  development  of  a  TFP  alumni  network\u2014a  key \ningredient  in  developing  long-term  stakeholder  support  for  the  development  of  sustainable \nquality education in the Philippines. This will include the development of an online alumni \ndatabase, as well as social media channels and interactive communications tools. Under this \noutput, TFP will also procure 120 tablet computers or smartphones for use by teaching fellows \nduring their engagement with TFP. This output will further develop a TFP intranet to house and \ncentralize all TFP educational resources for teaching fellows, and train the 120 teaching fellows \non using the TFP intranet. \n \n3.  Comprehensive Monitoring and Evaluation System Established \n17.  This output will include the development and testing of a monitoring and evaluation \nsystem to track various TFP-related indicators, such as student learning and teaching fellows\u2019 \nperformance.  The  TA  will  support  the  development  and  implementation  of  standardized \ndiagnostics and quarterly tests to provide a baseline for monitoring and assessing student \nperformance. TFP will also engage (at no cost) the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-\nPAL) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to develop a framework for the conduct of an \nimpact assessment of TFP to be undertaken when the J-PAL team is of the view that there are \nsufficient data to implement a randomized control trial. In the meantime, TFP will carry out the \nnecessary data collection to facilitate the impact assessment. The use of J-PAL is justified given \ntheir  internationally  recognized  expertise  in  conducting  impact  evaluation  studies  and  their \nprevious  experience  in  evaluating  a  reading  program  offered  by  TFP\u2019s  predecessor,  SAS \nFoundation. It will also shorten administrative and startup times for preparing the evaluation \nframework. \n \n18.  Throughout the course of the TA, TFP will ensure that data are collected regularly and a \nfeedback mechanism for continuous improvement of the training program is implemented. TFP \nwill prepare knowledge products, and organize dissemination workshops or other activities in \ncollaboration  with  DepEd  and  ADB.  The  TA  will  share  knowledge  and  lessons  with  other \nmembers of the TFA network, including those in Southeast Asia and East Asia. Using the \nresults of monitoring and evaluation, TFP will collaborate with DepEd and teacher training \ncolleges to improve the design of pre- and in-service teacher training programs for greater \neffectiveness. \n \n ", "  5 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n19.  The TA is estimated to cost $678,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund and administered by \nADB. TFP\u2019s counterpart support will be in the form of counterpart staff, office accommodation, \nsecretarial  assistance,  domestic  transportation,  and  other  in-kind  contributions.  The  cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.   \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  TFP will be the executing agency and will implement the TA. ADB will enter into a \npartnership arrangement with TFP through a letter of agreement that sets out the terms and \nconditions of TA implementation. Use of TFP as the executing agency is justified given that they \n(i) were selected by TFA to establish TFP in the Philippines, (ii) have been involved in upgrading \nthe  skills  of  public  elementary  teachers  in  the  Philippines  since  1999,  and  (iii)  bring  the \nexperience and lessons from the implementation of ADB\u2019s CAMP TA. A steering committee, \nwith representation from TFP, DepEd, and Quezon City local government, will meet annually to \nreview  implementation  progress.  TFP  will  oversee  day-to-day  implementation,  including \ndisbursement,  reporting,  and  information  collection.  In  addition  to  the  purchase  of  tablet \ncomputers or smartphones for teaching fellows, the TA may also purchase office equipment, \ncomputers, printers, data management tools, and software licenses. At the end of the TA, tablet \ncomputers will be turned over to the DepEd schools at which the teaching fellows were placed.  \nOther equipment will be turned over to TFP. \n \n21.  The TA will be monitored by ADB\u2019s Southeast Asia Department and NGO and Civil \nSociety Center. Regular TA review missions will be fielded to monitor implementation progress. \nAll procurement will be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as \namended from time to time). For consulting services financed in whole or in part from the TA, \nTFP will engage consultants in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2013, as amended from time to time). Proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \nTFP will ensure that it maintains auditable records for any procurement of goods and services \nunder the TA, and will undergo an external audit by an independent auditing firm. The TA will \nstart  on  18  August  2014  and  end  on  17  August  2016.  TFP  has  developed  a  website \n(www.teachforthephilippines.org). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to the Government \nof  the  Philippines  to  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Republic  of  Korea  e-Asia  and \nKnowledge Partnership Fund for Teach for the Philippines, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n    Data Sources and   \n  Performance Targets and  Reporting   \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Mechanisms   Assumptions and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nBetter learning  The proportion of third grade  M&E reports by  Continued government \noutcomes, especially  elementary students reading at  TFP   prioritization of the basic \nin functional literacy,  appropriate age level  education sector  \namong elementary  increases from 60% in 2014 to   \nstudents in schools  80% in 2021  TFP continues to operate at \nexisting levels after the \nsupported by TFP \ntechnical assistance ends \n \nRisk \nThe system is not replicated \ndue to lack of funding, interest, \nor changing priorities \nOutcome      Assumption \nA scalable and  Accessible online platform to  M&E reports by  DepEd continues to recognize \nsustainable pre- and  support and assess pre- and  TFP  TFP program and coordinate \nin-service training  in-service training developed,    its implementation with TFP \nprogram that is based  by the second quarter (Q2) of     \non information and  2016    Risk \n \ncommunication    Legal provisions allowing the \nM&E reports by \ntechnology and will  At least 90 teaching fellows  use of nonregistered teachers  \nTFP \nenhance the  (27 male and 63 female)  in DepEd schools are repealed \ncompetencies of  graduate from TFP Summer \npublic elementary  Institute and are eligible to sit \nschool teachers  the Licensure Examination for \nTeachers, by Q2 of 2016 \n(2014 baseline: 27 male and \n63 female) \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.

Objectives \n \n1.  The  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  be  implemented  by  Teach  for  the \nPhilippines (TFP) in coordination with the Department of Education (DepEd) and will identify, \ndevelop, and support a community of 120 teaching fellows over a period of 2 years. DepEd has \nsigned a memorandum of agreement with TFP to allow for the piloting of the K to 12 program in \ngrade 3, and the partnership allows\u2014for the first time\u2014noneducation majors and professionals \nto teach in the public school system. The expected outcome is a scalable and sustainable pre- \nand in-service training program that is based on information and communication technology and \nwill enhance the competencies of elementary school teachers. \n \n2.  The key features are: (i) teaching fellows teach in high-need public schools (selected in \nconcert with DepEd) for 2 years using innovative pedagogical strategies and maximizing the use \nof internet in the classroom; (ii) teaching fellows receive intensive training at the TFP Summer \nInstitute,  following  modules  of  teaching  as  leadership,  pedagogy,  and  technology  in  the \nclassroom;  and  (iii)  teaching  fellows  are  supported  during  their  2  years  by  a  leadership \ndevelopment team and an online intranet. A key feature of TFP is that teaching fellows will \nreceive better pre-service training than is available to other teachers. They will also benefit from \nthe development of progressive online training methodologies and applications for continuous \nand consistent in-service training. TFP will also include detailed online program monitoring, \nincluding online tracking of student performance and monitoring of indicators such as teaching \nfellow and student satisfaction, net enrollment rates, dropout and completion rates, and levels of \nfunctional literacy. \n \nB.  Outputs and Implementation Arrangements \n \n3.  The TA will deliver three outputs: (i) TFP Summer Institute strengthened, (ii) interactive \nonline system to support TFP teaching fellows developed, and (iii) comprehensive monitoring \nand evaluation system established. TFP will be the executing agency and will implement the TA. \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) and TFP will sign a letter of agreement. \n \nC.  Detailed Tasks \n \n4.
