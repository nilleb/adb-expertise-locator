INTRODUCTION \n1.  Public procurement is increasingly being recognized as a tool to improve public service \ndelivery and broader development outcomes. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other \ndevelopment partners have supported developing member countries (DMCs) to improve their \npublic procurement systems since the 1990s. However, inefficient use of funds, continuing \ndelays in project implementation, and corruption remain a major concern to governments and \ndevelopment partners alike. Through the Paris Declaration, Accra Agenda for Action, and Busan \nDeclaration,  ADB  has  committed  to  increasingly  rely  on  country  systems  and  to  support \nprocurement capacities in DMCs. \n \n2.   As ADB is considering results-based lending and use of country systems, there is a \nneed for ADB to further strengthen its efforts to improve institutional capacity in DMCs and \nmitigate procurement and fiduciary risk within the framework of government-owned programs \ninstead of focusing on project-specific and transactional risk mitigation.1 At present, ADB does \nnot have a solid framework for engaging with borrowers and sectors that may be eligible for \nresults-based financing, and the proposed regional capacity development technical assistance \n(TA) provides a methodology for stepping up institutional procurement capacity. The design and \nmonitoring is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.   Efforts to reform DMCs' public procurement have primarily focused on first generation \nreforms at the national level (e.g., legal and regulatory frameworks) and individual staff skills \nenhancement  (by  training  government  officials  engaged  in  procurement).  Although  many \nprojects supporting procurement reforms have met their intended targets, a huge task remains \nto  translate  these  into  actual  changes  in  procurement  practices  and  improvements  to \nprocurement outcomes.3 \n \n4.  The TA will promote a new approach that focuses on ministries or local governments \n(procuring entities4) and other principal participants in the procurement process in key sectors. \nThe procuring entities will be determined in cooperation with the national public procurement \nauthorities and regional departments. A partnership approach with the procuring entities will be \nimplemented to  improve  their  procurement  operations. If  weaknesses  that  prohibit  efficient \nprocurement management are found outside the realm of procuring entities, the TA may support \ninitiatives to rectify these weaknesses, whether they are institutional or organizational (e.g., in \nnational procurement regulatory agencies, supreme audit institutions, the private sector). The \napproach recognizes that procurement capacity development5 is a long-term effort and must \n                                                \n1  The policy paper highlights that \u2015institutional development is the second objective behind the emergence of the \nRBF [results-based financing] approach. \u2026 RBF supports building sound institutions and delivering development \nresults as two complementary elements of sustainable development.\u2016 ADB. 2012.  Piloting a Results-Based \nFinancing for Programs Modality. Manila. p. 2. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 28 November 2012. \n3  The Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD-\nDAC), through its task force on procurement, has recommended a shift from a focus on compliance to a focus on \nprocurement outcomes in the Cusco declaration on procurement: \u2015Increase focus on performance outcomes to \ndrive policies, management and accountability\u2026\u2016 \n4  Procuring entities are executing and/or implementing agencies that implement ADB-financed projects. The term \n\u2015procuring entity\u2016 will be used for the purpose of clarity of the TA paper. \n5  Using the OECD-DAC definitions, \u2015capacity\u2016 is \u2015the ability of people, organizations and society as a whole to \nmanage successfully their own affairs\u2016 and \u2015capacity development\u2016 is \u2015processes whereby people, organizations \nand society as a whole unleash, strengthen, create, adapt and maintain capacity over time.\u2016 OECD. 2006. The \nChallenge of Capacity Development: Working Towards Good Practice. Paris p. 12. \n ", "2   \nbuild on procuring entities\u2019 ownership and be tailored to the specific circumstances. The focus \non individual procuring entities will allow innovative and focused interventions that can yield \nresults without major legal or institutional reforms being necessary. The lessons learned and \nresults achieved can be replicated in other procuring entities. \n \n5.  Experience from ADB-financed projects across DMCs shows that procurement takes a \nconsiderable amount of time and is often a source of delay in project implementation.6 ADB \ncarries out procurement capacity assessments of procuring entities during project processing to \ndetect risk areas and adopt suitable risk mitigation measures during project implementation. \nRisk mitigation is essential to safeguard ADB\u2019s reputation and ensure that ADB financing is \nspent as intended. However, these risk mitigation measures do not aim at developing the long-\nterm  capacity  of  the  procuring  entity.  The  underlying  causes  of  weak  procurement  and \nimplementation capacity, whether they are inherent in the procuring entity or in the environment \nwhere the procuring entity operates, are not necessarily dealt with. \n \n6.  The causes of weak procurement and implementation capacity in DMCs are not uniform, \nbut some common challenges are noticeable. Good organizational practice includes setting \nspecific targets on the performance of the agency\u2019s procurement portfolio and continuously \nmonitoring  results  to  identify  areas  for  improvement.  This  strategic  approach  to  managing \nprocurement  requires  the  appropriate  organizational  setup,  the  right  capabilities  of  and \nincentives for procurement staff, and appropriate systems and internal procedures, which to \nvarying degrees are not present in many procuring entities. A procuring entity functions within a \ngiven  governance  system  and  often  the  procurement  governance  structure  is  weak. \nProcurement audit capacity is often low in government audit institutions, competition authorities \nrarely have the capacity to investigate collusive practices in the private sector, and independent \ncomplaint mechanisms are either non-existent or not functioning well.7 \n \n7.  The private sector is a key player in public procurement. However, in many DMCs \ncompetition in the private sector for public contracts is limited due to entry barriers, collusive \npractices, or the lack of capacity to meet all requirements in the bidding procedures. Yet both \nthe private sector and civil society can play an important role in improving public procurement by \ndemanding a more equal and transparent process, with civil society acting as a watchdog in all \nphases of the procurement process, including actual contract implementation. However, the \nprivate sector and civil society are rarely mobilized in this manner. \n \n8.  The TA will be demand-driven to ensure ownership and commitment from executing \nagencies. For each country and procuring entity supported through the TA a performance and \nmonitoring framework will be developed. \n \n9.  The TA is linked to another TA under preparation by ADB's Central Operations Services \nOffice (COSO)\u2014TA for Enhancing Capacity for Effective Project Implementation8. Both aim at \nimproving  the  implementation  management  of  executing  agencies  of  ADB-funded  projects. \n                                                \n6  ADB 2011 Annual Portfolio Performance Review 2011. Manila. \n7  No  comprehensive  comparative  study  exists  covering  DMCs.  However,  a  review  of  country  procurement \nassessment reports and OECD\u2019s methodology for assessing procurement system indicates that while the legal and \nregulatory frameworks are often quite solid, the public procurement market allows limited competition, and \noversight institutions and actual application of rules are weaker. A proxy indicator for the robustness of public \nprocurement systems is how much of donor funds use country procurement systems as defined in the Paris \nDeclaration. From 2005 to 2010 the percentage has only improved slightly from 40% to 44% (OECD: Aid \nEffectiveness 2005\u20132010: Progress in Implementing the Paris Declaration).  \n8  ADB 2012. Enhancing Capacity for Effective Project Implementation. Manila (To be approved in December 2012) \n ", "  3 \nHowever, they intervene at different levels and with different time frames: The TA for Enhancing \nCapacity  Development  for  Project  Implementation  aims  at  building  the  capacity  of  EAs  in \nimplementing ADB projects and cover all fields of project implementation. It is therefore a more \nshort-term and project-specific capacity development intervention, which continues past efforts \nwith a more demand-focused strategy. This TA aims to catalyze reform efforts in a selection of \nprogressive and relatively experienced procuring entities to transform government procurement. \nThis would allow ADB to rely on the national systems for procurement and to move away from \nprior review. It is therefore a medium- to longer-term capacity development intervention at policy \nand procuring entity level, and is consistent with international moves to use country systems. \n \n10.  Furthermore,  the  TA  builds  on  ADB\u2019s  past  experiences  in  supporting  national \nprocurement capacity development through the ongoing TA for the Asia Pacific Procurement \nPartnership Initiative9 as  well  as  country-specific TA  in Indonesia10,  the  Philippines11,  and \nMongolia12. Such TA support has targeted national policy, national e-procurement systems, \nregional dialogue, and knowledge sharing. A recurrent theme is the lack of procurement metrics \nand quantitative evidence of tangible impact. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The  impact  of  the  proposed  TA  will  be  to  catalyze  reforms  across  the  region's \ngovernmental procuring entities that achieve sound country systems and better procurement \noutcomes. \n \n12.  The  outcome  will  be  stronger  strategic  procurement  management  in  participating \nprocuring  entities.  The  procuring  entities  will  use  the  procurement  strategy  as  a  tool  to \ncontinuously improve the procurement function. Each procuring entity will define the targets for \nprocurement performance. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  Output 1: Comprehensive procurement strategy formulated and implemented.13 \nEach procuring entity will devise a comprehensive strategy. Historical and current performance \nlevels for each of the participating procuring entities related to cost savings, procurement cycle \ntimes,  transparency,  and  fairness  will  be  used  to  define  new  performance  targets  for  the \nparticular procuring entity.14 Comparisons with international best practices will also be made to \nuncover performance gaps and recognize the most significant opportunities for improvement. To \nachieve its new performance targets the strategy should include recommendations on how to \n(i) optimize procurement staffing; (ii) acquire proper procurement skills through new hiring or \ntraining; (iii) review and redesign any dysfunctional procurement processes, especially those \nrelated to specifications development, bid packaging, approvals, record keeping, monitoring, \n                                                \n9  ADB 2011 Asia Pacific Procurement Partnership Initiative.

The proposed strategy will also recommend how the cross-functional change \nmanagement team can best be equipped to implement the strategy.  \n \n14.  Output 2: Key constraints and opportunities in the environment identified. The \nexternal  environment  has  influence  on  the  procuring  entities\u2019  potential  for  optimizing  their \nprocurement. The exact interventions to meet output 2 depend on the country and sector \nconditions but may include analysis of (i) market conditions, (ii) legal and regulatory constraints \nand  weaknesses,  (iii)  possible  improvements  to  procurement  auditing  and  complaints \nmechanisms, and (iv) how best to mobilize of non-state operators to ensure accountability, \ntransparency, and monitoring of the procurement process. \n \n15.  Output 3: Lessons from implementing the approach disseminated. For each of the \nselected procuring entities, lessons learned will be disseminated through a knowledge product \nas well as stakeholder workshop within the particular country. In addition, a comparative study \nwill be carried out to draw and compare the lessons and best practices from all the selected \nprocuring entities. Furthermore, the progress of the procuring entity, including performance \ntargets and procurement strategy, will be published.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,500,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). However, TA activities will be undertaken \nin any DMC only if such DMC confirms its no objection to such TA participation. Detailed cost \nestimates and the financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  ADB will be the executing agency. COSO will be responsible for all TA activities. The TA \nwill  be  implemented  from  January  2013  to  July  2016.  Implementing  agencies  will  be  the \nselected procuring entities and/or the national procurement authorities. COSO will work closely \nand agree with the relevant regional departments on proposals for support under the TA.  \n \n18.  The TA will require international consultants (estimated 40 person-months) and national \nconsultants (estimated 100 person-months) with skills in procurement management, change \nmanagement, and capacity development. Individual terms of reference will be developed for \neach  subproject  under  the  TA.  Consultants  will  be  recruited  either  through  a  firm  or  as \nindividuals. ADB will recruit all consultants in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2010 as amended from time to time). All equipment will be purchased following \nADB Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). Disbursements under the \nTA will be done in accordance with the Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as \namended from time to time). \n \n ", "  5 \n19.  Discussions  with  regional  departments  have  generated  interest  from  Bangladesh, \nIndonesia, Pakistan, and Viet Nam.15 It is proposed that the TA will initially focus on these \ncountries. The following criteria will be used in determining whether a procuring entity is eligible \nfor support under the TA: \n(i)  The  government  has  implemented  (or  is  implementing)  first-generation \nprocurement  reforms  and  the  legal  and  regulatory  frameworks  support  the \nprinciples  of  public  procurement,  including  open  competition,  transparency, \naccountability, and value for money. \n(ii)  The procuring entity and ADB have a long-term relationship and the procuring \nentity will implement ADB-financed projects in the foreseeable future. \n(iii)  The procuring entity\u2019s senior management is supportive and takes ownership of \nefforts to improve transparency and accountability in the procurement process \nwith the aim of improving procurement outcomes. \n \n20.  Resident missions will, in consultation with relevant sector divisions and the COSO \ncountry focal point, submit for COSO review (i) a brief proposal outlining the scope and the \nparticipating procuring entity, (ii) confirmation of the government\u2019s request for ADB support, \n(iii) detailed terms of reference for the consultants, and (iv) a detailed budget.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,500,000 on a grant basis \nfor Developing Procurement Capacity for Improved Procurement Outcomes, and hereby reports \nthis action to the Board. \n \n \n                                                \n15 Afghanistan,  Nepal,  Papua  New  Guinea,  the  Philippines,  and  Uzbekistan  are  other  countries  that  regional \ndepartments have suggested for possible inclusion in the TA. COSO will assess the demand from DMCs, regional \ndepartments and resident missions and if warranted seek additional funds from development partners. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n \nData Sources and \nPerformance Targets and  Reporting \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Mechanisms   Assumptions and Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \nCatalyzing of reforms  Public procurement policy  Website or annual  Governments continue to \nacross the region's  bodies develop guidelines  report of the public  support public \ngovernmental  for strategic procurement.  procurement policy  procurement reforms. \nprocuring entities that  body \nNational monitoring \nachieve sound country \nsystems of procurement \nsystems and better \noutcomes are \nprocurement \nimplemented. \noutcomes \nOutcome      Risks \nStronger strategic  Participating procuring  Procuring entities'  Procuring entities\u2019 senior \nprocurement  entities meet 80% of their  procurement reports  managements do not \nmanagement in  procurement performance  and procurement  provide enough resources \nparticipating procuring  targets by 2016 (baseline  strategy  and authority to the \nentities  to be developed in  procurement function to \n \ncooperation with  implement and sustain \nparticipating procuring  changes. \nentities) \nOutputs      Assumptions \n       \n1.
