INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  As an integral part of its effort to reduce poverty and promote inclusive economic growth \nin its developing member countries (DMCs), the Asian Development Bank (ADB) is committed \nto strengthening national governance systems and reducing vulnerability to corruption. However, \nADB\u2019s  2013  review  of  governance  of  procurement  processes  found  that  the  procurement \ncapacity  of  executing  and  implementing  agencies  is  generally  weak  and  that  procurement \ngovernance is inefficient.1 Even in agencies that have participated in short-term procurement \nworkshops and training, and which have been implementing ADB projects for years, the quality \nand timeliness of procurement activities have not always improved. ADB\u2019s midterm review of \nStrategy 2020 noted that while project performance improved during 2011\u20132012, disbursements \ndeclined  due,  in  part,  to  the  weak  capacity  of  executing  and  implementing  agencies  and \nprolonged procurement processes.2 The midterm review recommended better targeting and \nmore intensive development of agency capacity, together with an increase in resources to \nassist.3 \n \n2.  The  executing  and  implementing  agencies  are  aware  of  their  weaknesses  and  the \ndelays in procurement, which result from the comprehensive clarification process prior to ADB \napproval of evaluation reports. In 2012 and 2013, during in-house integrity and procurement \ntraining missions conducted by staff of the Central and West Asia Department (CWRD) and the \nOperations  Services  and  Financial  Management  Department  (OSFMD),  agencies  have \nrequested additional procurement assistance and training. In response to these requests, and to \naddress  concerns  identified  by  ADB,  CWRD  has  designed  regional  capacity  development \ntechnical assistance (TA) to improve the quality and efficiency of procurement processes of \nexecuting and implementing agencies in participating DMCs in Central and West Asia.4 The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  In 2013, the 10 DMCs of Central and West Asia held 25% (or $16.2 billion) of ADB\u2019s \nsovereign  portfolio  with  126  active  projects.6   Translating  these  investments  into  poverty \nreduction and inclusive economic growth requires that the executing and implementing agencies \nresponsible  for  implementing  those  projects  are  able  to  secure  quality  goods,  works,  and \nconsulting services in a timely manner. For ADB-financed activities, these agencies procure \ngoods, works, and consulting services in accordance with ADB\u2019s procurement and consulting \nguidelines,  which  emphasize  efficiency,  transparency,  and  accountability.  The  ability  of \nexecuting and implementing agencies to secure quality goods, works, and services in a timely \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2013. Procurement Governance Review. Manila. \n2  ADB. 2014. Midterm Review of Strategy 2020: Meeting the Challenges of a Transforming Asia and Pacific. Manila. \n3  ADB. 2013. Technical Assistance. Operations Manual. OM D12/BP. Manila. Included in \u201ccapacity development,\u201d is \n\u201cimproving the technical, managerial and financial capabilities of recipients to meet the specific institutional and \norganizational development need.\u201d As applied to procurement, this would address ADB\u2019s five basic procurement \nprincipals, as outlined in section 1.2 of ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time), \nincluding (i) ensuring that ADB-approved resources are used only for procurement of goods and works supplied \nfrom, and produced in, member countries of ADB except in extraordinary circumstances as approved by the Board \nof Directors; (ii) ensuring economy and efficiency in the implementation of procurement activities; (iii) ensuring \nfairness and competition in procurement processes; (iv) encouraging the development of domestic contracting and \nmanufacturing industries in the project country; and (v) ensuring transparency in the procurement process. \n  4  No-objection approvals will be sought from respective governments prior to placing international procurement \n  consultants in a resident mission or assigning them to work with specific executing and implementing agencies.  \n5  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 28 April 2014. \n6  These countries include Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Pakistan, \nTajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. \n ", "2  \nmanner requires a number of related and independent conditions, including (i) the ability of such \nagencies to prepare proper bidding documents; (ii) the presence of qualified vendors7 in the \nlocal, regional, or global markets; (iii) vendors\u2019 awareness of a project\u2019s need for the goods, \nworks, or services; (iv) interest by qualified and reputable vendors to provide them; (v) vendors\u2019 \nability to submit quality prequalification applications, bids, and proposals;8 and (vi) the proper \nevaluation of those bids by executing and implementing agencies. The absence of any of these \nconditions may delay procurement processes and may  result in the award of contracts to \nunqualified  entities,  which  may  lead  to  underperformance  and/or  delays  in  project \nimplementation. As a result, development objectives may not be met. \n \n4.  ADB\u2019s  procurement  governance  review  found  considerable  delays  in  procurement \nprocesses, often resulting from additional time needed to correct or clarify bid documents and \nbid evaluation reports. The review observed that past action plans to strengthen the capacity of \nagencies implementing ADB-financed activities were insufficient to develop the skills needed to \nensure  timely,  accountable  oversight  of  procurement  processes;  and  recommended  to \nstrengthen  training  programs for  executing  and  implementing  agencies  and  to  redeploy  or \nrecruit procurement personnel who can contribute to capacity development of these agencies. \nAdditionally, more critical review of submitted bids has identified that additional integrity due \ndiligence is needed to verify material information presented within them, to ensure that contracts \nare awarded to vendors who have the necessary experience and, when relevant, financial \nresources to execute them successfully. \n \n5.       Tied to procurement capacity is the environment in which ADB projects occur, and \ncorresponding governance risks. Procurement processes are part of a project\u2019s larger financial \nmanagement and governance responsibilities, and, as such, procurement processes may be \nstrengthened  or  constrained  by  governance  matters.  ADB\u2019s  Governance  Framework,  as \ndescribed in the Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan (GACAP II), recognized \nthat  procurement  is  a  key  challenge  throughout  ADB\u2019s  DMCs. 9  It  recommended  that \nprocurement capacity and risk(s) be assessed at the country, sector, and project levels during \npreparation of country partnership strategies (CPSs), and be assessed and mitigated at the \nproject level during project preparation. As part of the CPS process, risk assessments and risk \nmanagement plans are developed to identify risks in the areas of public financial management, \nprocurement,  and  anticorruption\u2014together  with  plans  to mitigate those  risks.10 However,  a \nreview of GACAP II, conducted in 2013, found that in the majority of projects developed, risk \nassessment and management plans were not incorporated in subsequent project design\u2014\nresulting  in  continued  risk.  Similarly,  while  all  CPSs  in  Central  and  West  Asia  identify \nprocurement and corruption risks, no specific measures have been taken in any of the 10 DMCs \nto directly address the concerns raised. Human and financial resources are needed to address \nthe procurement and corruption-related risks identified in the risk assessment and management \nplans and CPSs. \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n6.  CWRD proposes a phased approach to a longer term, sustainable procurement skills \ndevelopment plan to strengthen the cadre of procurement professionals within each of the \nCentral and West Asia countries, who are able to plan and execute necessary procurement \nactions in accordance with ADB requirements. As the first phase of this plan, CWRD proposes \n                                                \n7  \u201cVendors\u201d is used to describe suppliers, contractors, and consultants collectively.  \n8  Hereafter collectively referred to as bids. \n9  ADB. 2006. Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan. Manila. \n10 ADB. 2013. Implementation Review of the Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan (GACAP II). Manila. \n ", "  3\nto provide regionally-based human resources to help strengthen the capacity of executing and \nimplementing agency personnel to conduct procurement activities responsibly through applied \ntraining and assistance to these agencies during key stages of ongoing procurement. In the \nsecond phase, CWRD will seek to expand the sustainability of procurement-related knowledge \nthrough the applied training of local talent, to broaden the professional talent base available in-\ncountry.11  \n \n7.  This TA seeks to maintain ADB\u2019s efficiency and effectiveness to support better project \nimplementation  during  the  reform  and  rationalization  of  ADB\u2019s  procurement  system,  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  commitments  in  the  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020.  It  will \ncomplement  and  reinforce  procurement-related  initiatives  being  conducted  by  OSFMD  and \nother regional departments.12 Working with OSFMD to draw on lessons learned from these \ninitiatives, CWRD will continue to develop appropriate activities for longer-term sustainability of \nprocurement capacity development in Central and West Asia.  \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact will be enhanced operational effectiveness of ADB projects in Central and \nWest  Asia.  The  outcome  will  be  that  executing  and  implementing  agencies  demonstrate \nimproved capacity to conduct procurement activities efficiently. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  This TA will have two outputs: (i) procurement training and workshops provided, and \n(ii) integrity due diligence conducted. The TA will prioritize projects that have not already made \nprovisions for independent international procurement specialists and which plan to procure \ncontract packages valued between $1 million and the Procurement Committee threshold.  \n \n10.  Output 1: Procurement training and workshops provided. The TA will strengthen the \ncapacity  of  executing  and  implementing  agencies  by  providing  field-based  procurement \nconsultants in each of the Central and West Asia subregions (Caucasus, Central Asia, Pakistan, \nand Afghanistan). The consultants will provide applied training and on-the-job assistance to \nexecuting  and  implementing  agencies  during  key  stages  of  procurement  processes\u2014\nstrengthening these agencies\u2019 capacity to prepare prequalification and bid documents, conduct \npre-bid meetings, verify information presented in bids, apply evaluation criteria properly, and \nimprove the quality of bid evaluation and consultant selection reports.   \n \n11.    Output 2: Integrity due diligence conducted. The TA will provide financial resources \nto verify information presented in bids and assist with qualitative bid evaluation. This may \ninclude subscriptions to closed-source databases, fees associated with obtaining transcripts \nfrom  university  clearinghouses  to  confirm  education  experience,  or  costs  associated  with \nacquiring documents from government institutions. For more complex inquiries, additional due \ndiligence reports may be commissioned to validate material information. \n                                                \n11 CWRD is in discussion with OSFMD about developing a procurement certification program on an institutional level \nfor national procurement professionals. This would be subject to approval of a minor change in scope for this TA in \nconjunction with a request to increase the TA amount. \n12 ADB. 2012.

Manila.  \nThese two TAs are short-term in nature, (i) providing one-time, workshop-style training to specific executing and \nimplementing agencies; (ii) conducting a limited number of capacity assessments; and (iii) analyzing constraints at \nthe policy level.  ADB.  2013. Technical Assistance for Improving Procurement in South Asia. Manila. \n ", "4  \n \n12.  It  is  assumed  that  Central  and  West  Asia  governments  will  remain  committed  to \nimproving project implementation and that executing and implementing agencies will retain \nqualified  personnel  who  are  able  to  make  independent  procurement  decisions  or \nrecommendations without political influence. A risk to this TA is that political influences and/or \nsecurity instability in some countries may delay the implementation of loan and grant-financed \nprojects. Concurrence will be sought from Central and West Asia countries and executing and \nimplementing agencies prior to selecting projects for inclusion in the proposed TA. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,500,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources).  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The TA will begin on 1 June 2014 and will be completed by 31 August 2017. ADB will be \nthe executing agency. CWRD\u2019s Portfolio, Results, Safeguards and Social Sector Unit will be the \nfocal point within ADB, working in conjunction with OSFMD\u2019s procurement specialist assigned to \nwork in the Office of the Director General, CWRD and CWRD\u2019s project administration unit heads. \nCWRD\u2019s Portfolio, Results, Safeguards and Social Sector Unit will administer and implement \nthe TA, and will coordinate activities with OSFMD to maximize synergies with OSFMD\u2019s TA \nactivities. \n \n15.  Three international procurement consultants (up to two of whom may be from Central \nand West Asia) will be contracted for 54 person-months.13 ADB resident missions will provide \nwork  space  for  the  consultants.14 The  proposed  TA  will  engage  additional  short-term  and \nspecialized national or international consultants, subject to availability of funds, to assist on an \nad hoc basis or to undertake specialized technical work as requested by participating executing \nand implementing agencies. 15 Recruitment of all consultants will be conducted in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). \nIndividual consultant selection will be used to recruit consultants, as the skills needed are at an \nindividual level and no value-added input by a firm is expected. The terms of reference for the \ninternational  procurement  consultants  are  in  Appendix  3.16 Integrity  due  diligence  activities \nrequiring specialized consulting skills will be contracted through competitive channels using \nconsultants qualification selection or through direct selection in exceptional cases when services \nare available by a limited number of individuals or firms.  \n \n16.  Resources will be provided for (i) occasional translation and interpretation services (to \nbe procured through ADB\u2019s Office of Administrative Services for headquarters-based needs, \nand  through  country-office  systems  for  field-based  needs);  (ii)  equipment  (scanners  and \nprojectors for use of the consultants);17 and (iii) advertisement and outreach activities related to \nlocal vendors\u2019 workshops, and (iv) for additional workshops and travel for consultants, ADB staff, \n                                                \n13 Based on the performance of the TA and demand from the executing and implementing agencies, additional \nfinancing may be requested to extend the inputs of the international consultants. \n14 Resident missions to be selected during inception mission. \n15 It is anticipated that national procurement personnel will be incorporated into the second funding phase of this TA. \n16 Terms of reference for additional short-term or specialized procurement expertise and for integrity due diligence \nundertakings will be developed as needs are identified during implementation. \n17This will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time). \n ", "  5\nresource speakers, and executing and implementing agency personnel.18 Disbursement will be \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended \nfrom time to time). \n \n17.  A review of the TA will be conducted at the end of the first year to assess progress, fine-\ntune  outputs,  and,  if  necessary,  make  adjustments  to  key  activities  and  implementation \narrangements. A full assessment will be undertaken at the conclusion of the TA to present the \nachievements and share lessons learned. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,500,000 on a grant basis \nfor Improving the Capacity and Integrity of Procurement Processes in Central and West Asia, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n \n                                                \n18 Travel budgets may be used for ADB staff to participate in international events relevant to procurement and \nintegrity, in accordance with the memorandum on Use of Bank Resources: Regional Technical Assistance and \nTechnical  Assistance  vs.  Internal  Administrative  Expenses  Budget,  issued  by  the  Budget,  Personnel,  and \nManagement Systems Department and the Strategy and Policy Department on 26 June 2013. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData Sources \nPerformance Targets and \nDesign Summary  and Reporting  Assumptions and Risks \nIndicators with Baselines \nMechanisms \nImpact      Assumptions \nEnhanced  By 2019:                                 Central and West Asia \noperational    governments remain \neffectiveness of  At least 90% of sovereign  Development  committed to improving \nADB  operations\u2019 performance at  Effectiveness  project implementation. \nprojects in Central  implementation rated  Review   \nand West Asia  satisfactory  (baseline 81%,    Other factors do not \nQ4 2013)  negatively affect project \n  performance. \n \nRisk \nPolitical and security \ninstability in Central and West \nAsia countries delay project \nimplementation. \nOutcome      Assumption \nExecuting and  By 2018:    Executing and/or \nimplementing    implementing agencies are \nagencies  Comprehensive analysis and  TA progress  able to make procurement \ndemonstrate  due diligence completed for  reports  decisions or \nimproved  all bid evaluation reports    recommendations without \nprocurement  under procurement  Resident mission  political influence. \ncapacity  committee threshold  tripartite portfolio \n \nsubmitted to CWRD   review reports \n \n \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
