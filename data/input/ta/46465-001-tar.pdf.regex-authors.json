The regional capacity development technical assistance (TA) responds to South Asian \ndeveloping member countries\u2019 (DMC) needs in the urban sector as articulated in the country \npartnership strategies (CPS). The CPS\u2019 have a  strong emphasis on knowledge management \nand  solutions,  results  orientation,  and  regional  cooperation.  The  TA  also  recognizes  that \nsolutions for increasingly complex urban environments require bold action guided by knowledge. \n \n2.  The draft concept paper, including the design and monitoring framework, and financing \nand implementation arrangements were shared and discussed with the four governments.1 \nThey expressed interest in participating in the K-Hub; and agreed with the TA impact, outcome, \noutputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements and indicative terms of \nreference. ADB asked each government to nominate a national center to lead hub activities in \ntheir country; and the government of India agreed to host the regional center.2 \n \n3.  The  TA  aligns  with  ADB\u2019s  commitment  to  foster  development  knowledge.  This \ncommitment aims to enhance the capacity of DMCs and improve the quality of ADB operations. \nADB\u2019s Strategy 2020 recognizes that supporting DMCs to gain knowledge is an important driver \nof change.3 The TA therefore aims to strengthen the capacity of urban research and training \ninstitutions in South Asia and develop a regional network for creating and sharing urban sector \nknowledge. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  The TA aims to build the capacity of existing urban research or training institutions in \nselect countries in South Asia to provide policy makers and practitioners with innovative and \nevidence-based solutions. This objective is increasingly relevant since urbanization is generally \non an upward trajectory5 throughout the region and investments have failed to keep pace with \nthis growth.  Many  of  the  region\u2019s  cities  are facing  similar challenges of  inadequate  urban \ninfrastructure,  environmental  degradation,  and lack  of (or  low-quality) services.  South  Asia \naccounts for almost half of the world\u2019s urban poor. Maintaining vital economic growth while \nensuring and improving access to services and a livable environment, including for the poor, is a \nmajor challenge facing cities in South Asia and will be the focus of the K-Hub. \n \n5.  Challenges  and  opportunities.  The  challenges  to  enhancing  city  competitiveness, \ninclusiveness,  and  environmental  sustainability  include  poor  leadership,  weak  governance, \noperating inefficiencies, need for substantial capital investments, and a lack of baseline data for \neffective analysis. Strategic thinking is needed on how to grapple with these issues and develop \nmore integrated and evidence-based solutions to be implemented at scale. While South Asia \nhas good examples to learn from, national and regional knowledge remains fragmented. The K-\nHub will help to consolidate existing and future knowledge and disseminate it widely. It will also \n                                                \n1  The following consultation missions were fielded: (i) Bangladesh\u2013September 2013, (ii) India\u2013February and October \n2013, (iii) Nepal\u2013August 2013, and (iv) Sri Lanka\u2013September and October 2013. Government endorsement letters \nare provided in Supplementary Appendix A. \n2  The institution in India will play the dual role of national and regional center. \n3  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 20 November 2013. \n5 Proportion  of  urban  population  by  country  (1980  and  2025  projections):  Bangladesh  (14.9%/36.0%);  India \n(23.1%/37.2%); Nepal (6.1%/22.4%); Sri Lanka (18.8%/18.0%). Note: In Sri Lanka the urbanization rate is projected \nto stabilize but urban population will grow in absolute terms.

It will also provide a platform for engaging with organizations outside the \nSouth Asia region, including universities, think tanks, and other knowledge hubs. \n \n6.   The TA supports ADB\u2019s Urban Operational Plan, 2012\u20132020 and its objective of an \nintegrated approach to urban development with systematic benefits and improvements in the \nquality of life in Asia\u2019s cities. ADB will leverage the K-Hub to (i) develop and promote innovative \nand cross-cutting ideas, (ii) integrate learning into ADB investment projects and advisory work, \nand (iii) strengthen knowledge partnerships in the region. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The impact will be improved urban policy formulation and service delivery in selected \nSouth  Asian  DMCs.  The  outcome  is  improved  capacity  for  knowledge  generation  and \nmanagement in the urban sector in selected South Asian DMCs. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The TA will (i) develop sector and thematic knowledge products, (ii) produce technical \nand policy briefs, (iii) build capacity of national centers to strengthen evidence-based policy \nadvocacy, (iv) disseminate knowledge, (v) formulate recommendations to improve university \nurban planning curricula, (vi) develop twinning arrangements between municipalities and service \nproviders, and (vii) conduct regional and country learning events and networking opportunities. \nThe TA will build capacity for the K-Hub\u2019s sustainable operations. The TA has four outputs. \n \n9.  Output 1: Regional knowledge hub established. The TA will operationalize the hub, \nconsolidate  and  share  knowledge,  and  develop  a  network  between  national  centers  and \nstrengthen links with policy makers and practitioners. \n \n10.  Output  2:  Improved  capacity  for  outcome-oriented  research  and  knowledge \ndissemination. The TA will assess current capacity of national centers for evidence-based \npolicy advocacy; and build the capacity of researchers and trainers for more outcome-oriented \napproaches to use knowledge to inform policy and practice. It will provide national centers with \nopportunities to apply these skills through (i) original research that is operationally relevant to \ngovernments and ADB (three knowledge products),6 (ii) the development of technical and policy \nbriefs, and (iii) the provision of design and implementation support for twinning arrangements. \nThe working group will decide on the research agenda (i.e., exact topics to be studied) based on \ndemand, identified gaps, relevance to South Asia and operations, and competitive advantage of \nthe  national  centers.  Learning  activities  will  include  structured  twinning  arrangements  for \nmunicipalities and service providers and a forum for mayors. \n \n11.  Output  3:  Improved  urban  management  and  planning  education  curriculum \nprepared. The TA will review current urban planning curricula in the region, and identify gaps \nand opportunities for strengthening it, including consultations and discussions, expert analysis, \nand survey of graduates to understand the skills gap.  \n \n                                                \n6  The knowledge products may have different styles and objectives. For example, they may include documentation \nand analysis of successful experiences, or provide \u201chow to\u201d guidance in the form of a manual. \n ", "3 \n12.  Output 4: Improved capacity for managing knowledge hub operations. The TA \nfocus  will  be  on  ensuring  effective  management  of  hub  operations  and  thinking  ahead  to \nsustainability.  All  of  the  national  centers  are  existing  institutions  with  ongoing  programs, \nactivities, and funding arrangements. The TA complements and strengthens these existing \nactivities and competencies, adds a regional dimension, and strengthens their national role. The \nbusiness  model  for  the  K-Hub  will  be  elaborated  at  an  early  stage  of  implementation  in \nconsultation with governments, and a consultant will work with each national center to develop a \nbusiness plan related to innovative sanitation activities.7 \n \n13.  Emphasis on innovative sanitation. The specific topics for research, learning events, \nand twinning partnerships will be determined during implementation. Prospective topics include \n(i) public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs) for nonrevenue water reduction and 24-hour, 7-days a \nweek supply; (ii) improving the implementation of wastewater contracts; (iii) corporatization of \nutilities; (iv) municipal finance; (v) metropolitan and regional planning and governance; (vi) low-\ncarbon  urban  development;  (vii)  multimodal  transport  systems;  and  (viii)  urban  flood \nmanagement.  Innovative  sanitation  will  be  strongly  emphasized.  Sanitation  is  a  challenge \naffecting all cities in South Asia, with dire consequences for public health, the environment, and \nthe economy. In response, with the support of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the K-Hub \nwill lead research, learning events, and twinning partnerships on non-network urban sanitation \nsolutions at scale, with a focus on PPPs, business models, and affordable technology. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.35 million, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis  by  the  Sanitation  Financing  Partnership  Trust  Fund 8 under  the  Water  Financing \nPartnership Facility, and administered by ADB. The remaining $850,000 will be financed on a \ngrant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V and TASF-others).9 The cost \nestimates and financing plan is in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  ADB is the executing agency and will play a leading role in quality assurance. ADB will \nsupport national centers in research design, analysis, and marketing of findings. It will monitor \nimplementation progress through regular contact with the regional and national centers and as a \nmember of the working group. \n \n16.   The implementing agencies in each participating country are:  \n(i)  Bangladesh: Local Government Division of the Ministry of Local Government,   \nRural Development and Cooperatives;  \n(ii)  India: Ministry of Urban Development;  \n(iii)  Nepal: Ministry of Urban Development; and   \n(iv)  Sri Lanka: Urban Development Authority.  \n \n17.  The role of the implementing agencies is to (i) support and endorse their respective \ncenter  as  the  national  hub  for  urban  knowledge  management,  (ii)  promote  integration  of \nknowledge with policy and operations, (iii) provide guidance to national centers on research \ntopics and hub activities, (iv) provide opportunities for national centers to share findings with \n                                                \n7 The Water Financing Partnership Facility has agreed to contribute additional funds through direct charges to help \nthe national centers to structure their sanitation focus, e.g., to identify capacity needs and strategic partnerships. \n8  Contributor: the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. \n9  TASF funds are to be provided as follows: $800,000 from TASF-others, and $50,000 from TASF-V. \n ", "4       \npolicy  makers  and  practitioners,  and  (v)  provide  leadership  on  the  K-Hub  sustainability \nframework. \n \n18.   Regional and national centers. The K-Hub headquarters will be in India at the National \nInstitute  of  Urban  Affairs  (NIUA).  Each  participating  country  government  has  selected  a \ngovernment-endorsed  national  center  for  urban  knowledge  management  based  on  their \ncapacity, reputation for urban sector research and training, and comparative advantage. The \nnational centers for each country are (i) Bangladesh: the International Training Network (ITN) \nCentre at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET); (ii) India: NIUA (both \nregional and national center); (iii) Nepal: Urban Development Training Centre; and (iv) Sri Lanka: \nUniversity of Moratuwa, Department of Town and Country Planning (see Figure 1). \n \n19.  Working group. The TA will be guided by a working group chaired by a representative \nof the regional center who will act as coordinator. The group will include a member of each \nnational center and ADB. It will adopt a charter to guide its operations and meet at least \nannually or as needed for planning and to monitor progress of TA activities.10 It will prepare joint \noutputs, including a business plan and a sustainability plan. The implementing agencies will be \ninvited to participate in the first meeting and other meetings as appropriate. \n \n20.  Procurement. The TA will be implemented from January 2014 to December 2016 with \nan additional 3 months for closing. It requires approximately 156.5 person-months of consulting \nservices (4.5 person-months of international inputs and 152 person-months of national inputs). \nOutline  terms  of  reference  are  in  Appendix  3  and  detailed  terms  of  reference  are  in \nSupplementary  Appendix  B.  National  and  international  individual  consultants  and  national \ncenters will be selected following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on Use of Consultants (2013, as amended \nfrom time to time). For Bangladesh, single source selection (SSS)11 to recruit ITN-BUET as a \nnational center is justified as it is the leading university and research institute for urban planning \nand the water and sanitation sector, and has the multidisciplinary staff required for successful \nimplementation. For India, SSS to recruit NIUA as the regional and national center is justified \nbecause of its government-endorsed mandate (urban sector, national scope, bridging the gap \nbetween researchers and practitioners) and wide network and track record working  at the \ncentral, state, and local levels.12 For Sri Lanka, SSS to recruit the University of Moratuwa as the \nnational center is justified because it is the only university in the country with an urban planning \ndepartment, and the country has no urban sector think tanks. For Nepal, SSS to recruit the \nUrban Development Training Centre is justified because of its mandate (urban sector, national \nscope) and strong networks with municipalities across the country. In addition, all four national \ncenters  have  been  endorsed  by  their  governments  as  critical  to  the  implementation  and \nsustainability of the K-Hub initiative. The contracts of national centers will be output-based \naccording  to  an  agreed  business  plan.  Disbursements  and  procurement  will  be  made  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time) and Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time). 13 \n \n                                                \n10  Meetings will be planned in connection with other events as much as possible to reduce travel costs. \n11  This initiative aims to build the capacity of leading research and training institutes, which may include government-\nowned institutes, to increase the overall knowledge management generating and management capability of each \nparticipating country and across the region. Due to the nature of the initiative and its long-term objective, SSS is \nconsidered appropriate for their engagement. \n12  NIUA  is  an  autonomous  scientific  and  research  organization  registered  as  a  society  under  the  Societies \nRegistration Act XXI of 1860 on 12 January 1976. \n13  The equipment will remain with NIUA upon TA completion. \n ", "5 \n21.  Output dissemination. The TA outputs will be disseminated through a wide variety of \nmediums, including ADB and national center channels and networks. The outputs will be in a \nvariety of forms, including publications, policy notes, reports, conference proceedings, and the \n \n \nFigure 1: South Asia Urban Knowledge Hub Institutional Framework14  \nExecuting Agency\nWorking Group\nOther knowledge \nhubs\n\uf0a71 member per country\nSouth Asia Network \uf0a7National centers coordinate activities with other  \nrelevant institutions within respective country\nBangladesh, India, Nepal, Sri Lanka \uf0a7Each national center represented in Working Group\nImplementing  Bangladesh Nepal India Sri Lanka\nAgencies Ministry of LGRD  Ministry of Urban  Ministry of Urban  Urban Development \n& Cooperatives Development Development Authority\nITN- Other \nNational  UBannivgelrasditeys ohf   UDrbeavnel Torpamineinngt   University of  cofuuntutrriee s \nCenters Moratuwa participation \nEngineering &  Centre\ne.g. Bhutan, \nTechnology Maldives\n \n   ITN = International Training Network, LGRD = Local Government and Rural Development. \n   Source: Asian Development Bank. \nK-Hub website.

ADB will identify opportunities to integrate outputs with \nongoing and future operations, policy dialogue, and learning events. \n \n22.   Monitoring  and  evaluation.  The  ADB  project  team  will  work  closely  with  national \ncenters to develop the detailed business plan in accordance with the design and monitoring \nframework,  and  regularly  monitor  implementation  progress.  National  centers  will  prepare \nquarterly progress reports. The regional center will submit a consolidated quarterly report within \n30  days  of  quarter  end  to  ADB  and  the  implementing  agencies.  ADB  will  consult  with \nparticipating governments in preparing the TA completion report, which evaluates the quality of \nthe outputs post-implementation.\n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n23.   The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Sanitation Financing Partnership Trust Fund under the Water \nFinancing Partnership Facility, and (ii) ADB providing the balance not exceeding the equivalent \n \nof $850,000 on a grant basis for the South Asia Urban Knowledge Hub, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n \n                                                \n14 Other countries in South Asia, e.g. Bhutan and Maldives, will not be excluded from participation in the K-Hub.
