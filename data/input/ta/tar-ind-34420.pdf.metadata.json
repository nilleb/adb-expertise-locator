During the 2001 Country Programming Mission, the Government of India requested the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) to extend technical assistance (TA) for the preparation of the \nNational Highway Corridor (Sector) Project1 (\u201cthe 2003 Project\u201d). In response, an ADB TA Fact-\nFinding Mission visited India from 4 to 11 September 2002 and reached an understanding with \nthe  Government  on  the  concept  of  the  2003  Project  and  the  objectives,  scope,  and \nimplementation arrangements of the TA.2   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Sector Background. India has an extensive and diverse transport system, comprising \n3,299,000 kilometers (km) of roads, 62,800 km of railways, and about 14,500 km of navigable \ninland waterways. The modal mix between road and rail transport3 has been continuously \nshifting  away  from  railways  to  roads  due  to  the  former\u2019s  lack  of  user-oriented  service. \nConsequently, road transport is now the dominant mode of transportation, accounting for 68% \nof freight (in terms of ton-km) and 73% of passengers (in terms of passenger-km). This modal \nshift is likely to continue in the future, as transport demands increasingly shift from bulk to \nsmaller  lot  size  cargoes  with  more  frequent  delivery  requirements.  This  calls  for  further \nimprovement and expansion of road networks. \n \n3.  India\u2019s road network consists of three categories: (i) national highways (58,000 km), (ii) \nstate  highways/roads  (119,000  km),  and  (iii)  rural  roads  (3,122,000  km).  While  national \nhighways account for only 2% of the total road network in terms of length, they carry about 40% \nof the total traffic. National highways are managed by two agencies: the National Highways \nAuthority of India (NHAI) and the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MORTH). NHAI \nwas established in 1988 and operationalized in 1995 as an operating arm of MORTH. NHAI is \nresponsible for one fourth of the national highways, which carry around 25% of the nation\u2019s total \ntraffic, while MORTH is responsible for the remaining three fourths of national highways, which \ncarry 15% of the total traffic. \n \n4.  India\u2019s economy has long suffered a chronic capacity shortage of its highway systems. \nThirty-nine percent of the national highway systems is still of single-lane standard; the majority \n(59%) is two-lane, while four-lane or higher standard highways account for only 2%. Faced with \nthis inadequate capacity, the Government has decided to launch a radical program of upgrading \nkey national highway corridors, consisting of (i) the golden quadrilateral  \u2013 6,000 km, (ii) the \nnorth-south corridor (N-S corridor) \u2013 4,000 km, and (iii) the east-west Corridor (E-W corridor) \u2013 \n3,300 km. The program, called the National Highway Development Program, was announced in \n1998 and is to be completed by the end of 2007. Its total cost is estimated at around $13 billion. \n \n5.  Effective implementation of a program of magnitude requires the establishment of an \nenabling policy environment which, the Government has taken a series of actions to create, \nprincipally (i) simplifying the century-old land acquisition procedure by amending the National \nHighway Act (done in 1997); (ii) issuing and implementing a new policy guideline4 with the aim \nof facilitating private sector participation in highway development (1997); (iii) adopting a policy \n                                                 \n1 The project, previously called \u201cNational Highway Corridor (II) Project,\u201d first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities \nin September 2002. \n2 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities, in September 2002. \n3  Inland waterways play a minor role in India\u2019s transport system; they carry only 0.15% of the total domestic cargo in \nterms of ton-km. \n4  \u201cGuideline for Private Sector Participation in Road Infrastructure,\u201d issued by MORTH in 1997 ", "2 \nsuch once a road is upgraded to a four-lane highway, it can be made tollable (1997); (iv) \nrevamping the central road fund by introducing an additional excise duty levied on petrol and \ndiesel (called a \u201ccess\u201d) (1998 and 1999); and (v) delegating broader decision-making authority \nto NHAI so that NHAI can make decisions on individual investments and procurement (2000). \n \n6.  While  these  policy  actions  have  brought  about  significant  changes  in  the  ways  to \nmanage the national highway sector, a number of issues remain. To address them in an \neffective and systematic manner, ADB has adopted a programmatic approach, an essential \nelement of which is to set out the medium- to long-term goals for ADB\u2019s intervention in the \nnational highway subsector and pursue the realization of these goals in a progressive and \nevolutionary manner through its multiyear lending operations rather than on a project-by-project \nbasis. Medium- to  long-term goals  include (i)  strengthening institutional capacity for project \nimplementation  and  contract  management;  (ii)  strengthening  financing  and  financial \nmanagement capability so as to effectively mobilize necessary funds from capital markets; (iii) \nenhancing highway operations and management; (iv) advancing the public private partnership \nconcept; and (v) transforming NHAI into a more financially and managerially autonomous body, \nincluding a corporatized form of the organization. \n \n7.  The sequential nature of the programmatic approach implies that project preparation and \nprocessing under the program are to be standardized and simplified over the years. As NHAI \nbuilds its project development and implementation capacity, ADB\u2019s evaluation of project viability \nshould be limited to those areas of relative weakness of NHAI. Direct appraisal by ADB staff \nshould be, wherever possible, replaced by appraisal by NHAI staff following guidelines set by \nADB. This shift will also meet the Government request for incorporating flexibility in adding or \nextending highway sections to be financed by ADB. However, given the magnitude of the \npotential  impact  of  large-scale  infrastructure  projects  on  the  environment  and  on  social \ndevelopment, the transition to a different modality of project evaluation should be gradual. \n \n8.   Concept of the 2003 Project.  During the TA Fact-Finding Mission, it was agreed to \nemploy the sector loan scheme in the envisaged 2003 project. This approach is justifiable \nbecause NHAI has a clearly defined medium-term highway development program; and it also \nhas  relatively  strong  institutional  capability  to  develop  projects,  particularly  with  regard  to \ntechnical and engineering capacity. While its environmental and social development capacity \nmust be further strengthened, the envisaged TA/loan programs5 should strengthen NHAI\u2019s \ncapacity  for  the  latter  areas.  Another  element  supportive  of  this  approach  is  a  series  of \ngovernment  policy  actions  taken  for  the  last  several  years  to  create  an  enabling  policy \nenvironment conducive to efficient highway development. Thus the criteria spelled out in ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on Operational Procedures, Section 5, on Sector Lending, have been satisfactorily \nmet. \n \n9.  The Mission and NHAI agreed that the 2003 project will cover priority sections of the E-W \ncorridor located in three states  (cid:190)  Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh (cid:190)  and  \npreliminarily identified the sections of the 672 km between Chittorgarh and Bhognipur to be \nassisted under the proposed 2003 project. It was further agreed that 10-20% of the project roads \nwill be developed under the private sector investment (PSI) scheme such as build-operate-\ntransfer (BOT) or annuity-based concessions. Two thirds of the remaining sections will be \ndeveloped as core subprojects, to be appraised by ADB, while the remaining third will be \n                                                 \n5  An environmental management component included in the Western Transport Corridor Project (approved by the \nBoard in September 2001 and which become effective in February 2002) and a capacity-building TA component for \nemerging social issues included in the East-West Corridor Project (approved by the Board in November 2002).    ", "    3 \nnoncore subprojects, to be subsequently appraised by NHAI. The 2003 project will finance both \ncore and noncore subprojects, while the PSI elements are less likely to be financed under the \n2003 project.6 The latter would be developed either through ADB\u2019s private sector operational \narm or under direct PSI financing. Recommendations on what sections of the project roads will \nbe developed under what schemes will be formulated by the TA consultant already engaged \nunder ADB\u2019s ongoing PPTA for the National Highway Corridor  \u2013 Public Private Partnership \nProject. \n \n10.  Under the above arrangement, major project preparation activities will be carried out by \nNHAI  using  its  own  resources,  covering  all  aspects  of  project  preparation  (cid:190)   technical, \neconomic, financial, institutional, environmental, and social. The TA will essentially supplement \nNHAI\u2019s efforts and assure that all ADB\u2019s requirements are satisfactorily met. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n11.   The purpose of the TA is to facilitate NHAI\u2019s preparation of the proposed 2003 project \nfocusing on the areas of NHAI\u2019s relative weakness. The TA is designed to facilitate transition \nfrom  the  conventional  project  loan  scheme  to  the  sector  loan  approach,  with  increased \nresponsibility being shifted to NHAI. Additional assistance will be provided to facilitate the \nparticipation of private sector investors in the development of the project roads. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.   The Project will be divided in three types of subprojects in which different ways of \nproject processing will be applied: (i) core subprojects, to be prepared by NHAI and appraised \nby ADB (Scheme A); (ii) noncore subprojects, to be prepared and appraised by NHAI and \napproved by ADB (Scheme B); and (iii) PSI subprojects, to be developed primarily by the private \nsector (Scheme C). The modality of assistance will differ from scheme to scheme, as follows: \n \n(i)  Scheme A. Assistance to core subprojects \n \n(a)  Provision of advice to ensure that all ADB requirements are satisfactorily \nmet in the envisaged subprojects with particular emphasis on (i) financial \nand economic assessment; (ii) poverty and social assessment, including \npoverty  impact,  indigenous  peoples,  communicable  diseases,  women \ntrafficking, and resettlement planning; (iii) environmental management; \nand (iv) engineering support (though limited). \n(b)  Preparation of specific documents including (i) a summary economic and \nfinancial assessment report; (ii) a poverty impact assessment report; (iii) a \nsocial  assessment  report;  (iv)  if  necessary,  an  indigenous  peoples \ndevelopment  plan;  (v)  resettlement  plans;  and  (vi)  a  summary  initial \nenvironmental  examination  (SIEE)  or  summary  environmental  impact \nassessment  (SEIA)  report,  including  environmental  management  and \nmonitoring plan (EMMP) elements. \n \n                                                 \n6  However, the possibility has been kept open at this stage. If the detailed financial analysis demonstrates the need \nof substantial grant to from NHAI, the project may consider extending assistance to the PSI component to make the \nBOT component attractive for private sector investors.  ", "4 \n(ii)  Scheme B. Assistance to noncore subprojects \n \n(a)  Development of a set of manuals to facilitate NHAI\u2019s development of \nsubprojects, covering all aspects of the project including (i) financial and \neconomic  assessment;  (ii)  poverty  and  social  assessment,  including \nindigenous  people  and  women  trafficking;  (iii)  resettlement;  and  (iv) \nenvironmental management. These manuals are essentially compilations \nof ADB\u2019s relevant guidelines  and  checklists  for  each  area  of  project \nevaluation.  They  will  also  include  necessary  instructions  to  NHAI  on \nprocedural requirements and required activities for each stage of the \nproject preparation and processing.  \n(b)  Development  of  a  resettlement  framework  to  be  applied  for  noncore \nsubprojects. The framework will set out the policies and procedures to be \nfollowed in preparing the resettlement plans of subsequent subprojects. In \naddition, the consultant will include in the manual the arrangements by \nwhich  NHAI  will  screen,  develop,  and  submit  to  ADB  subproject \nresettlement plans at appraisal and/or prior to the commencement of civil \nworks, in line with ADB involuntary resettlement policy. \n(c)  Development  of  a  summary  report  format  to  be  used  for  NHAI\u2019s \nsubmission of noncore subprojects to ADB for its approval. \n(d)  Identification of areas requiring additional capacity building, if any. \n(e)  Organization of a workshop for training staff and NHAI\u2019s consultants to \nfamiliarize them with the manual and summary report format. \n \n(iii)  Scheme C. Assistance to PSI subprojects \n \n(a)  Preparation of specific documents including (i) a summary economic and \nfinancial assessment report; (ii) a poverty impact assessment report; (iii) a \nsocial  assessment  report;  (iv)  if  necessary,  an  indigenous  peoples \ndevelopment plan; (v) resettlement plans; and (vi) SIEE or SEIA report, \nincluding EMMP. \n(b)  Projection of future traffic for the PSI subprojects, study on the impact of \nthe introduction of tolls7 on traffic and development of subproject-specific \ntolling  strategy,  design  of  investment  packages  for  subprojects,  and \ndeveloping a framework of the concession arrangement covering both \nconstruction and operation and management.  \n(c)  Development of tender documents including concession agreements and \nselection criteria of bidders, and provision of assistance to the process of \nevaluating proposals and selecting a successful bidder. \n \nC.   Cost and Financing \n13.   The total cost of the TA is estimated at $650,000 equivalent, of which $376,200 will be \nforeign exchange costs and $273,800 equivalent will be local currency costs. ADB will finance \n$500,000 equivalent, which include the entire foreign exchange cost, and $123,800 equivalent \nin local currency. The remaining $150,000 equivalent will be contributed by the Government and \nwill include office accommodation, counterpart staff remuneration, transportation, and surveys. \n                                                 \n7 The level of tolls is determined uniformly by the Government for the entire NHDP. Thus the competition by potential \nBOT contractors will be made by the minimum amount of the grant (including negative grant) to be obtained by \nNHAI.  ", "    5 \nThe TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government has \nbeen informed that financing the TA does not commit ADB to financing a subsequent loan \nproject. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are shown in Appendix 2.    \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  NHAI will be the Executing Agency. It will form a project preparation and processing unit \nheaded by the chief general manager in charge of the E-W and N-S corridors, and will consist of \nofficials  in  charge  of  environment,  social  development,  technical/procurement,  and  private \nsector development.  As stated earlier, NHAI will carry out feasibility studies, preliminary design, \ndetailed design, and development of bidding documents through its own consulting firms. The \nprimary role of the TA consultants is to ensure that the project prepared by NHAI is consistent \nwith ADB\u2019s requirements, and to provide necessary guidance to NHAI to ensure that they can \nappraise noncore subprojects in a satisfactory manner.  \n \n15.  An  international  consulting  firm  will  be  engaged  to  cover  economic  and  financial \nassessment, poverty impact analysis, environmental assessment, and provision of engineering \nsupport, using ADB\u2019s quality and cost-based selection procedures and in accordance with its \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB on the \nselection and engagement of domestic consultants (a biodata technical proposal method will be \nused). The task requires 8 person-months of international and 6 person-months of domestic \nconsultant  inputs.  Two  individual  consultants,  one  international  and  one  domestic,  will  be \nengaged for conducting the social assessment and resettlement planning, in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB on the \nselection and engagement of domestic consultants. The latter task requires 4 person-months of \ninternational and 3 person-months of domestic consultant inputs.   \n \n16.  The TA will commence in February 2003 and be closed in September 2003. Terms of \nreference for the consulting services are outlined in Appendix 3.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to the Government \nof India for preparing the National Highway Corridor (Sector) Project, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. The technical assistance, initially financed as a grant, will be subject to the \nreimbursement arrangements set forth in Technical Assistance Operations8 and Streamlining of \nTechnical Assistance Operations.9  If the technical assistance results in an ADB loan, ADB may \ncharge against the loan, and recover from it, the portion of the initial grant that exceeds \n$250,000 equivalent. \n                                                 \n8 ADB. 1977.

No \nContribution of the highway/road sector to reduce poverty in India: \n \nAlthough the highway/road sector is not a core sector for poverty alleviation in India, road \ninfrastructure has been recognized as an important instrument for social and economic \nchange. The 9th Five-Year Plan of India has allocated a large amount of money for \nhighway/road infrastructure. The Government\u2019s road development policy is comprehensive \ntowards the establishment of total connectivity within the nation including national highways, \nstate roads, and rural roads. ADB intends to assist the Government\u2019s efforts to improve the \nhighway/road system in its entirety. It is intended to support not only the national highway \nsystem, but also the state and rural road segments. \n \nThe proposed project, which will pass through agricultural areas and commercial and industrial \ncenters, will have social and economic impact on the communities that inhabit the project \ncorridor and beyond. The highway improvement is expected to contribute to the development \nof the project region through (i) improved connectivity to production and commercial centers; \n(ii) higher productivity through greater mobility;(iii) increased opportunities for nonfarming \nemployment, particularly beneficial to unemployed youth; (iv) lower prices of selected \nconsumer commodities and agricultural inputs; and (v) improved marketability of agricultural \nsurplus at competitive prices throughout the year. It will also enhance social benefits such as \nbetter access to educational and health facilities. Short-term benefits will also accrue to \nunskilled labor including farm laborers and other income earners for new employment \nopportunities to be generated by highway construction and maintenance, tree planting, and \nother related activities. \n \nB.   Poverty Analysis \nProposed Classification: Others. Thematic (economic growth and private sector \ndevelopment) \n  \nPoverty Analysis: \nThe project corridor of about 670 kilometers in length passes through Rajasthan, Madhya \nPradesh (MP), and Uttar Pradesh (UP). In general, the project regions are not densely \npopulated and are less urbanized due to hilly and forested terrain except for 18 major urban \nsettlements. In addition, about 120 small towns and rural settlements exist along the project \ncorridor. The Rajasthan section contains the bulk of the settlements.  \n \nAgriculture is the main occupation in the districts along the project corridor. The hilly, forested, \nand undulating terrain with limited irrigation restricts agricultural productivity and employment \ngeneration. Low yield dryland crops like millet and maize predominate, while more productive \nfood and cash crops of wheat, sorgum, and groundnut are restricted to small western and \neastern sections of the corridor. Industrial and mining activities are limited in the region except \nclose to Chittorgarh and Udaipur. ", "  Appendix 1  7 \nUnfavorable physical conditions (terrain, rainfall, and soils), together with limited access to \nsocial infrastructure (less than 10% of the population in the Rajasthan and MP sections have \naccess to safe drinking water), have produced a high incidence of poverty and unemployment. \nMost indicators of poverty and social deprivation like population below the poverty line, work \nparticipation rate, gender ratio, life expectancy, and comprehensive human development index \nare unfavorable (except in selected sections in the western part of the corridor) based on \nsecondary data sources (state statistical abstracts, and national human development reports). \nThe workforce participation rate is relatively low, ranging from 34% in Jalaun to 49% in Jhansi. \nThe employment rate is high only in the Chittorhgarh and Udaipar sections of Rajasthan due to \nexpanding mining and industrial activities. Except one district of Jhansi in UP, all other districts \nexhibit high rural poverty ratios (26-34%) that exceed the national average of 26%. Poverty \nratios are even higher in urban areas. UP, MP, Rajasthan, and Gujarat rank 31,30,27, and 17, \nrespectively.  \n \nBetter connectivity to the urban settlements located along the project corridors and their \nvicinities, together with improved marketability of agricultural products, will contribute to the \nregional economy, which will contribute to poverty reduction. Meanwhile, the marginal \nlandowners, landless laborers, and small business enterprises may become more vulnerable \ndue to loss of agricultural and other assets and livelihood bases because of the need for land \nfor alignments in the hilly areas and bypasses around urban settlements. Special \nconsiderations and safeguards have to be incorporated in the project design and the \nresettlement plan (RP) to obviate such possible losses and vulnerability components.  \n \nC.  Participation Process \nStakeholder Analysis Prepared:  No  \nParticipation strategy required: No                                                                                                      \n \nParticipation strategy: \n \nThe National Highways Authority of India conducted broad based consultations with key \nstakeholders in the past and is intending to expand this process under the Asian Development \nBank\u2019s assistance (a capacity-building component for emerging social issues is included in the \nproposed East-West Corridor Project).

The project will be divided in three types of subprojects in which different ways of project \nprocessing will be applied: (i) core subprojects, to be prepared by the National Highways \nAuthority of India (NHAI) and appraised by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) (Scheme A); (ii) \nnoncore subprojects, to be prepared and appraised by NHAI and approved by ADB (Scheme \nB); and (iii) private sector investment (PSI) subprojects, to be developed primarily by the private \nsector (Scheme C). The modality of assistance will differ from scheme to scheme. Matching \neach subproject with the appropriate scheme will be carried out by the project preparatory \ntechnical  assistance  consultants  engaged  for  the  2002  NHAI  Project  prior  to  the \ncommencement of this  technical assistance (TA).  \n \nA.  Economic  Analysis,  Financial  Analysis,  Poverty  Assessment,  Environmental \nAssessment, and Engineering Support     \n2.  A consulting firm will be engaged for carrying out economic and financial analyses, \npoverty assessment, and providing advisory support for the engineering aspect of the civil \nworks.  The  consultant  team  will  consist  of  (i)  an  international  transport  economist  with  \nexperience in economic and financial analysis for highway projects, familiarity with poverty \nanalysis and knowledge of the procedural requirements of ADB and/or the World Bank; (ii) a \ndomestic poverty specialist with experience in the poverty assessment of highway projects; (iii) \nan international financial analyst who is familiar with project finance schemes such as build- \noperate-transfer arrangements and annuity-based concessions for toll road operations; (iv) an \ninternational environmental specialist; and (v) a domestic highway engineer with adequate \nexperiences in highway design and proof checking. The international transport economist will \nserve as team leader and will organize and manage the entire work program and ensure the \ntimely delivery of quality products to ADB. The task will require 5 person-months of input by the \ninternational transport economist, 2 person-months by the international financial analyst, 1 \nperson-month by the international environmental specialist 3 person-months by the domestic \npoverty specialist, and 3 person-months by the domestic highway engineer.  \n \n1.  International Transport Economist \n \n3.  For Schemes A and C, the TA consultant will carry out economic analysis in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. NHAI\u2019s consultants are likely to \nuse HDM IV.  The task of the TA consultant is therefore to ensure that the economic analysis to \nbe carried out by the NHAI consultants meets ADB\u2019s requirements. This will, in turn, require the \nexamination of methodologies, validation of the data collected by the NHAI consultants, and \nadditional runs of the HDM model so as to conduct supplementary analyses for the economic \nanalysis.    In  reviewing  and  supplementing  the  analysis  by  the  NHAI  consultants,  the  TA \nconsultant should pay special attention to the following elements: \n \n(i)  Traffic projection. The traffic forecasts should be made for representative types \nof the vehicles, based on the analysis of the historical and current traffic data. If \nnecessary, the TA consultant should carry out traffic counts at key locations to \nverify the accuracy of the current traffic level data. Examination should be made \nof how seasonal fluctuations of traffic are estimated. If necessary, validation \nshould be made by monthly sales data of fuel. Projections should be also made \nin  consideration  of  relevant  economic  variables  including  the  net  domestic \nproducts of the individual states. The TA consultant should also examine the \nappropriateness of the demand elasticity for the economic growth employed by \nthe NHAI consultants, which tends to be high in India. Projection should be made \n ", "12  Appendix 3 \nfor normal and diverted traffic. If appropriate and necessary, the projection of the \ngenerated traffic should also be made.  \n \n(ii)  Economic benefits. The savings of vehicle operating costs should be calculated \nin an appropriate manner under the \u201cwith\u201d and \u201cwithout\u201d project case scenarios.  \nEconomic benefits accruing from time savings should also be included. A trial \nshould be made to estimate the benefits accruing from the possible reduction in \ntraffic accidents. \n \n(iii)  Economic costs. The major cost element is that for upgrading the project \nhighways.  It  should  include  civil  works  costs,  consultant  fees  for  detailed \nengineering design and construction supervision, and physical contingencies, but \nexclude taxes, duties, price contingencies, price escalation, and interest during \nconstruction. Costs for acquiring rights of way and clearing utilities/trees should \nbe included. Incremental operation and maintenance costs should be calculated \nas the difference between the \u201cwith\u201d and \u201cwithout\u201d project cases. They could be \nnegative or positive. These cost calculations will be done by converting financial \ncosts into economic costs with the use of appropriate conversion factors. The \nNHAI consultants often use a standard conversion factor (SCF) of 0.8 or 0.85. In \nthat case, the TA consultant has to ascertain how this SCF was calculated (e.g., \nwhether it is for just excluding the taxes and duties or for correcting other price \ndistortions).  \n \n(iv)  Estimation  of  economic  return.  Annual  streams  are  to  be  estimated  for \neconomic costs and benefits over 25 years on a constant price basis. If the NHAI \nconsultants use a different period, it could  be adopted. However, the same \nproject period must be used for the economic and financial analyses, which are \noften different in India. An appropriate salvage value is to be assigned for the \nsubprojects.  Based  on  this,  annual  cost  and  benefit  streams,  the  economic \ninternal rate of return (EIRR) and net present value should be calculated for each \nsubproject.  \n \n(v)  Sensitivity  analysis.  The  sensitivity  of  the  EIRR  should  be  analyzed  with \nrespect to key parameters that underlie its estimate including cost increase, \nbenefit reduction, and delay in project implementation. The EIRR should also be \ncalculated for the combination of these risks. \n \n(vi)  Risk analysis. The TA consultant should also carry out quantitative risk analysis \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Handbook  for  Integrating  Risk  Analysis  in  the \nEconomic Analysis of Projects so as to calculate a composite indicator for the \noverall project risk.    \n \n(vii)  Preparation of a summary note. Based on the above review and examination \nof the NHAI consultants analysis, the TA consultant should prepare a summary \nnote  of  several  pages  for  the  economic  analysis,  which  will  include  (i)  a \ndescription of traffic projections; (ii) methodologies for economic assessment \nincluding the conversion factors used (if individual conversion factors are used \nfor unskilled labor, energy, or other cost factors, those should be explained in the \nnote), (iii) calculation of the economic benefits, (iv) calculation of the economic \ncost, (v) estimation of economic returns, (vi) sensitivity analysis, and (vii) risk \nanalysis.   ", "  Appendix 3  13 \n4.  The  TA  consultant  will  conduct  a  distribution  analysis  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nHandbook for Integrating Poverty Impact Assessment in the Economic Analysis of Projects. The \nconsultant will guide the domestic poverty specialist to obtain data necessary for conducting a \nquantitative analysis for the poverty impact of the project. The international consultant will also \ndirect the domestic poverty specialist and ensure the quality of the poverty impact assessment \nand the report summarizing the findings and analyses.  \n \n5.  For Schemes A and C, the TA consultant will carry out financial analysis in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s forthcoming Guidelines on the Financial Management of Investment Projects.    \n \n6.  For Scheme B, the consultant will develop a set of manuals to facilitate NHAI\u2019s appraisal \nof noncore subprojects, covering all aspects of the project including (i) financial and economic \nassessment,  (ii)  poverty  impact  assessment,  (iii)  social  assessment  including  indigenous \npeople, (iv) resettlement, and (v) environmental management. These manuals are essentially \ncompilations of relevant parts of ADB\u2019s guidelines and checklists applicable for national highway \nupgrading. They should also list, among others, all elements to be appraised by NHAI, and \nprocedural requirements and activities for each stage of project preparation and processing, and \nthey should note the main areas requiring special attention from NHAI in its appraisal of \nsubprojects.  \n \n7.  For Scheme B, the consultant will develop a summary report format to be used for \nNHAI\u2019s submission of subprojects to ADB for approval. \n \n8.  For Scheme B, the consultant will organize a workshop for training staff and consultants \nof NHAI to get them familiar with the manual and the summary report format. \n \n2.  Domestic Poverty Specialist \n \n9.  For Schemes A and C, the consultant will conduct community assessments on the \npoverty reduction impacts of the subprojects. \n \n10.  For Schemes A and C, the consultant will prepare a poverty assessment report in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Handbook  for  Poverty  Reduction  and  Social  Assessment.  For  \ncalculation of the quantitative impact of the Project on poverty reduction, the consultant will use \nthe input of the international transport economist on the distribution analysis. \n \n11.  For Scheme B, the consultant will provide inputs for the poverty assessment manual to \nbe  prepared  by  the  international  transport  economist.  The  consultant  should  also  provide \ninformation  on  relevant  parts  of  ADB\u2019s  guidelines  and  checklists  related  to  the  poverty \nassessment, all elements to be appraised by NHAI for individual subprojects, and procedural \nrequirements and activities for each stage of project preparation and processing, and should \nnote on the main areas requiring special attention from NHAI in its appraisal of subprojects.  \n \n12.  The  domestic  poverty  specialist  will  work  under  the  guidance  of  the  international \ntransport economist.   \n3.  International Financial Analyst  \n \n13.  For Scheme C, the consultant will (i) conduct a more detailed demand projection for the \nsection identified for PSI; the demand projection should take into account the impact of tolls1 \n                                                 \n1 The level of tolls is uniformly set by the government for the entire network of NHDP. It is adjusted annually based on \nthe wholesale price index.   \n ", "14  Appendix 3 \nand also possible diversion of traffic or generation of traffic in the specific situation of the road \nnetwork in the project influence area; (ii) conduct a study to assess the possible impacts of the \nintroduction of tolls on traffic, in terms of both its volume and the pattern of traffic flow; (iii) \ndevelop a project-specific tolling strategy; (iv) design a project specific investment package, and \nanalyze the need for a grant or other \u201csweetner\u201d to be extended by NHAI to make investment \nmore attractive to private sector investors; and (v) develop, based on the model concession \nagreement developed by NHAI and in consideration of tender documents previously prepared \nfor other private sector investment projects, tender documents including concession agreements \nand selection criteria for evaluating bidding proposals by private sector contractors. \n \n4.  International Environmental Specialist \n \n14.  For Schemes A and C, the consultant will review, verify, and, if necessary, revise the \nenvironmental  assessment  to  be  carried  out  by  NHAI  consultants  to  ensure  that  all  key \nelements  are  adequately  covered  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Assessment \nRequirements  (1998) and Environmental Guidelines for Selected Infrastructure Projects (1993). \n \n15.  For Schemes A and C, the consultant will prepare a summary report for an initial \nenvironmental examination or, if required, for an environmental impact assessment. \n \n16.  For Scheme B, the consultant will prepare a manual on environmental assessment. The \nmanual will essentially be a compilation of the relevant parts of ADB\u2019s guidelines and checklists \napplicable for national highway upgrading.   \n \n17.  It  should  also  include,  among  others,  a  concise  description  of  all  elements  to  be \nappraised for individual subprojects, and the procedural requirements for each stage of project \npreparation and processing, and it should note main areas requiring the special attention of \nNHAI in its appraisal of subprojects.  \n \n5.  Domestic Highway Engineer \n \n18.  For Scheme A, the consultant will review and comment on the results of feasibility \nstudies  and  preliminary  designs  to  be  prepared  by  the  NHAI  consultants  with  regard  to \nengineering aspects, ensuring that (i) road safety measures are adequately incorporated in the \nhighway design; and (ii) the results of resettlement planning, social assessment, and the \nenvironmental assessment are properly reflected in the design. The consultant will provide \nnecessary advice to NHAI on engineering aspects. The consultant will also conduct a proof \ncheck for the detailed design prepared by the NHAI consultants.  \n \nB.  Social Assessment and Resettlement \n \n19.   Two individual consultants, an international resettlement specialist and a domestic \nsocial assessment specialist, will be engaged to carry out the tasks listed below.  The tasks will \nrequire 4 person-months of input by one international resettlement consultant and 3 person-\nmonths from one domestic social assessment consultant.  \n \n1.  International Resettlement Specialist \n \n20.  For Schemes A and C, the consultant will provide necessary guidance to the NHAI \nconsultants in their preparation of the resettlement plans (RPs); and review, verify, and edit the \nRPs to be prepared by the NHAI consultants so as to ensure that all requirements are covered \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Handbook on Resettlement. ", "  Appendix 3  15 \n21.  For Scheme B, the consultant will develop a resettlement framework to be applied for \nthe  subprojects  to  be  appraised  by  NHAI.  The  framework  will  set  out  the  policies  and \nprocedures to be followed in preparing the resettlement plans of subsequent subprojects. In \naddition,  the  consultant  will  prepare  a  manual  on  the  resettlement  so  as  to  facilitate  the \npreparation of resettlement plans by NHAI for noncore subprojects. The manual will essentially \nbe a  compilation of relevant parts of ADB\u2019s guidelines and checklists applicable for national \nhighway upgrading. It should also list, among others, all elements to be appraised by NHAI, and \nprocedural requirements and activities for each stage of project preparation and processing, and \nshould  note  the  main  areas  requiring  the  special  attention  of  NHAI  in  its  appraisal  of \nsubprojects. The manual should include information on  the arrangements under which NHAI \nwould screen, develop, and submit to ADB subproject RPs at appraisal and/or prior to the \ncommencement of civil works, in line with ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement.
