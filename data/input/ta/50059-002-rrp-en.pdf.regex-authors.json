THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nNepal for the Power Transmission and Distribution Efficiency Enhancement Project. The report \nalso describes the proposed administration of technical assistance (TA) to be provided by the \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction for Strengthening the Capacity of Nepal\u2019s Energy Sector to \nDeliver Gender Equality and Social Inclusion (GESI) Results, and if the Board approves the \nproposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA.1 \n \n2.  The project will enhance the distribution capacity and improve reliability and quality of \nelectricity supply in the Kathmandu Valley by reducing distribution system overloads and technical \nand  commercial  losses,  and  strengthen  associated  transmission  lines  through  the  Nepal \nElectricity Authority (NEA). The project will also support the implementation of other system \nefficiency upgrades and energy efficiency measures, such as advanced grid operations software, \ndistribution system automation, and smart metering.2  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Reliable  electricity  service  is  a  necessary  requirement  for  accelerating  economic \ndevelopment of a country and is also considered an important input in improving the quality of \nlife. Energy development in Nepal has been slow largely because of a history of weak and \ninconsistent policies, absence of an independent electricity regulator, lack of comprehensive \nplanning, public sector financing limits, NEA\u2019s credit and offtake risks, and difficulty in land \nacquisition and transmission line right-of-way issues. Nepal\u2019s overall electricity demand has far \noutgrown the supply: estimated peak demand in FY2016 was around 1,385 megawatt (MW) \nversus installed generation capacity of 835 MW, resulting in a deficit of about 550 MW. As a \nconsequence, Nepal has been suffering from a severe shortage of power with frequent load \nshedding. The quality of electricity supply in Nepal is among the poorest in the world, ranking \n137th out of 147 countries.3  \n \n4.  As a government corporation responsible for generation, transmission, and distribution, \nNEA has dominated Nepal\u2019s electricity subsector. It has recorded poor operational and financial \nperformance, and at the end of FY2015, its accumulated losses had reached NRs26.8 billion. In \nFY2015 alone, NEA incurred losses of NRs6.5 billion.4 The financial position of NEA is further \ndeteriorating because of factors such as (i) lack of cost-based tariff adjustments; (ii) high cost of \nservice arising from an elevated internal purchase price at generation point, the annual escalation \nof costs in purchasing power from independent producers, operation of thermal plants, import of \nrelatively high-cost seasonal energy from India, and increased operation and maintenance costs; \n(iii) high system losses at over 24%; and (iv) increased arrears largely from the public sector, \nincluding municipalities.  \n \n5.  The Government of Nepal endorsed an action plan in February 2016 to end the energy \ncrisis within 2 years. The Ministry of Energy prepared a concrete action plan to reduce power \nshortages within 1 year and eliminate them altogether within 2 years. The government has also \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance for the Power Transmission \nand Distribution Efficiency Enhancement Project (TA 9144-NEP). \n3  ADB. 2015. Asian Development Outlook. Manila. \n4  NEA. 2015. Annual Report. Kathmandu. \n ", "2 \ndeclared the National Energy Crisis Reduction and Electricity Development Decades, an action \nplan comprising 99 specific activities that are relevant to sector operations, including that of \nimproving  service  delivery  by  modernizing  the  electricity  distribution  system.  Some  visible \ndevelopments are noticed recently in terms of NEA\u2019s operational performance through significant \nreduction in load shedding in Kathmandu Valley and other major cities of Nepal together with \nelectricity theft control measures. Ultimately, the reform program will be successful only if energy \nand electricity pricing is rationalized and the sector shifts to a fully commercial basis, since \ngovernment budgets have not been sufficient to cover energy subsidies. \n \n6.  Electricity supplies are expected to increase rapidly during the next several years via \n(i) imports from India through the first 400 kilovolt (kV) cross-border line,5 (ii) commissioning of \nthe 456 MW Upper Tamakoshi hydropower project in 2019, and (iii) an additional 1,635 MW from \nmultiple  hydropower  projects  with  planned  commissioning  by  2022.  Therefore,  existing \ntransmission and distribution systems need to be immediately rehabilitated and upgraded for the \nnetwork to be able to deliver the additional electricity supplies to consumers. Given this, electricity \nnetwork enhancement has been a priority and is included in the government\u2019s action plan to end \nthe power crisis and provide reliable and affordable electricity, and universal access for all by \n2030. This effort is consistent with achieving Sustainable Development Goal #7 (Sustainable \nEnergy for All) as well as Nepal\u2019s Nationally Determined Contributions to the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change. \n \n7.  The Kathmandu Valley accounts for approximately 400,000 consumers or about 16% of \nNEA\u2019s total consumers in the country, and contributes to about 27% of the total revenue generated \nfrom the sale of electricity. There are 11 distribution centers which operate distribution networks \ncomprising 11.0 kV primary feeders and 0.4 kV lines. Power made available in the Kathmandu \nValley is about 400 MW, and the existing distribution network cannot handle more than this \namount without rehabilitation. This became clear in 2015, when liquefied petroleum gas was \nlacking and households were forced to use electricity for cooking, which meant an additional load \nof 200 MW. The distribution network could not handle the resulting overload, and numerous \ndistribution transformers were damaged. Moreover, energy consumption in the Kathmandu Valley \n(1,038 gigawatt-hours in FY2016) is rising more than 10% per year, which will lead to a doubling \nof demand every 7 years.  \n \n8.  The maintenance and reinforcement of the Kathmandu Valley electricity network have not \nkept pace with growth in electricity demand and the number of consumers added to the network.6 \nIt is imperative to enhance the distribution capacity and improve the reliability and quality of \nelectricity supply by reducing system overloads as well as technical and commercial losses \n(currently about 15%). In addition, the existing substation capacity needs to be augmented so that \nadditionally  incoming  power  can  be  accommodated.  Also,  implementation  of  other  system \nefficiency  upgrades  and  efficiency  measures\u2014such  as  advanced  grid  operation  software, \ndistribution system automation, and smart metering that will provide  consumers with more \ninformation about their own electricity use and greater flexibility in managing their own accounts\u2014\nwill modernize the distribution system and bring it technologically up to date. Further, system \nefficiency improvements and loss reductions to about 10% will improve NEA\u2019s financial health, \nwhile customers will benefit from more reliable and better electricity supply and less dependence \non diesel generators. Operational upgrades will also aid the integration of new generation capacity \n                                                \n5  This line has a capacity of at least 1,000 MW. \n6  The last planned systematic reinforcement was carried out about 15 years ago with the assistance from the Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency. \n ", "3 \nscheduled to come on line in the next 3\u20134 years. A project that covers these specific areas can \neasily be replicated in other cities in the country. \n \n9.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been the leading partner in Nepal\u2019s energy \nsector, supporting a broad spectrum of interventions in generation, transmission, distribution, and \naccess to energy. Since 2014, ADB\u2019s overall investment strategy has followed a logical sequence: \n(i) improve reliability and quality of grid-supplied electricity through network expansion, efficiency \nimprovements, and expanded imports; (ii) rationalize tariffs, with eventual elimination of non-\nlifeline subsidies; (iii) mobilize TA to develop large-scale hydropower generation; (iv) provide \nadditional financing for national grid connected utility-sale solar power development; and (v) \ncontinue financing for access to energy via renewable energy mini grids, supply-side efficiency, \nand other \u201clast mile\u201d interventions. ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2013\u20132017 for Nepal \nsupports the government's development objective of accelerated and inclusive economic growth, \nand tackles infrastructure bottlenecks in key areas such as energy services in order to create an \nenabling environment for increased business and employment opportunities.7 This project will be \nADB\u2019s first investment in Nepal that specifically focuses on energy efficiency by improving the \ndistribution system.8 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact will be reliable and efficient electricity supply for all achieved, aligned with the \nGovernment of Nepal\u2019s action plan to overcome the country\u2019s energy crisis.9 The outcome will be \nimproved access to efficient, adequate, and high-quality power supply in the Kathmandu Valley. \n \nC.  Outputs \n11.  The main outputs of this project will be: \n(i)  Transmission grid capacity to feed the primary distribution networks for the \nKathmandu Valley strengthened. Six new grid gas-insulated substations will be \nincluded  under  this  component.  A  220/132 kV  160  MVA  substation  each  at \nBarhabise  and  Laphsiphedi  and  a  132/11  kV  45  MVA  substation  at \nChangunarayan  are  necessary  to  help  complete  the  Tamakoshi\u2013Kathmandu \n220/400 kV transmission line project, which will then provide vital power supply to \nKathmandu from the power-generating stations that are being constructed in the \nKhimti (Tamakoshi) and Barhabise areas. Another three 132/11 kV 45 MVA each \nsubstations in Chapagaun, Mulpani, and Phutung will feed in necessary power to \nthe Kathmandu Valley. \n(ii)  Kathmandu Valley distribution network rehabilitated and capacity increased. \nThis covers distribution system automation and the rehabilitation of low-voltage \nand medium-voltage networks, initially in the central and northern distribution \ncenters of the Kathmandu Valley. The majority of the new and existing construction \nwill be underground, since overhead distribution is impractical in densely populated \nareas where access roads are very narrow. \n(iii)  Operational and financial performance of NEA distribution centers enhanced. \nSingle-phase  and  three-phase  smart  meters  with  associated  communication \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2013.

The \nestablishment of a dedicated PMD for ADB projects and streamlined internal NEA management \npractices (such as having a managing director to make all procurement decisions) has improved \nNEA\u2019s performance in project implementation. Project supervision consultants will be recruited to \nsupport NEA in implementing the project. All consultants will be engaged in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). As requested \nby NEA, advance contracting and retroactive financing will be considered, subject to a ceiling of \n20% and a time limit of not more than 12 months prior to the date of the loan agreement. ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time) will be followed. \n \n16.  The project is expected to be completed by December 2021. With the exception of one \nsupply contract, turnkey contracts will be tendered for project implementation. Construction \nactivities will require 48 months to complete. The total time for project implementation after loan \neffectiveness is estimated at 4.5 years for detailed design, engineering, tender preparation, \nevaluation, contract award, construction, and commissioning. The government will set up a high-\nlevel coordination committee representing key government agencies and other stakeholders to \nensure proper coordination between different agencies dealing with road, water supply, sewage, \ntelecommunication office, and cable television operators during the implementation of this project. \n \n17.

The TA helps fill the gaps in NEA\u2019s capacity for mainstreaming GESI in its \noperations to ensure energy access and its benefits for all. The TA will also support training of \nNEA staff in managing new energy technologies, in particular the smart grid functions and \nefficiency improvements that will be introduced by the project. In addition, the TA will support the \nNational Association of Community Electricity Users Nepal and 15 electricity user committees to \ndevelop their capacity for social inclusion in access to electricity, and to create energy-based \nlivelihoods  targeting  500  women.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  2  years,  and  will  be \nadministered by ADB in close coordination with NEA and ESSD. The TA implementation unit, with \na team of experts and NEA officials, will be based at the ESSD and work under the PMD\u2019s \nsupervision. An international consultancy firm, in partnership with a national nongovernment \norganization or a firm, will provide technical support for TA implementation. Consultants will be \nrecruited using ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to \ntime). A GESI action plan of the project includes all activities under the TA support. Necessary \nconsultations were held with NEA and ESSD officials, and the National Association of Community \nElectricity Users Nepal, and the TA concept and its implementation modality were agreed upon. \nDetails are included in the attached TA.14 \n \n19.  The TA will provide much-needed capacity development support to ensure that under \nNEA\u2019s operations, the energy needs of poor and disadvantaged communities are addressed; \nsocial safeguard risks minimized; and GESI results and impacts maximized, documented, and \nreported upon. The TA, estimated to cost $2 million, will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan \nFund for Poverty Reduction. The government will provide counterpart support in the form of staff, \noffice space and supplies, and other in-kind contributions.  \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n20.  The  project  aims  to  enhance  the  quantity  and  quality  of  power  supplied  to  NEA\u2019s \ncustomers in Kathmandu Valley which would require (i) augmentation of transmission substation \nfor supply to Kathmandu Valley; (ii) reconstruction and upgrading of medium voltage and low \nvoltage distribution networks in Kathmandu Valley; and (iii) introduction of smart grid elements in \nKathmandu Valley. With this objective and due to the inherent interconnectedness of each of \nthese areas, technical due diligence was undertaken on all outputs and confirmed that the cost \nestimates are reasonable and unit costs compare favorably with similar recent projects in India \nand Nepal. The work program provides for grid substations to complete the 400 kV transmission \nlink (initially operated at 220 kV) from Tamakoshi to Kathmandu and to bring much-needed \ntransmission capacity to the Kathmandu Valley. In addition, new grid substations will interconnect \nwith the 400 kV transmission line to the medium-voltage system inside the Kathmandu Valley. \nThis will ensure reliable and secure electricity services to NEA\u2019s customers. \n \n21.  The distribution components include, in a first phase, the rehabilitation of low-voltage and \nmedium-voltage  networks  in  NEA\u2019s  central  and  northern  distribution  centers,  which  supply \nelectricity to more than 90,000 existing customers in Kathmandu\u2019s central city area, including \n                                                \n13 The firm engaged will also help NEA in ensuring the implementation and monitoring of resettlement and rehabilitation \nefforts of people affected by the project. \n14  Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \ngovernment offices and many hotels, restaurants, and establishments critical to the local economy \nand the tourism industry. The project will introduce single-phase and three-phase smart meters \nin  keeping  with  modern  international  practice.  This  will  allow  automated  remote  customer \nmetering with the ability for both prepayment and post-payment, enhance the consumer interface, \neliminate  manual meter  reading  with  its  inherent  errors,  and  contribute  significantly  to  the \nreduction in nontechnical losses. \n \n22.  The proposed transmission facilities follow planning and design practices already being \nimplemented by NEA in other projects. The proposed distribution system investment will introduce \nnew planning and design practices and innovative technology to NEA and Nepal, reflecting \ninternational best practice. Overall, the proposed works are in keeping with international good \npractice and are considered technically acceptable. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n23.  Financial analysis of the project was carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nFinancial Management and Analysis of Projects.15 All financial costs and benefits are expressed \nin constant 2016 prices. NEA\u2019s weighted average cost of capital was estimated at 0.5% (in pretax \nreal terms). On the basis that the average retail electricity does not decline further in real terms, \nthe project is forecast to deliver a financial internal rate of return of 7.9%. \n \n24.  The project was analyzed for economic viability in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nEconomic  Analysis.16 A  \u201cwith  project\u201d  and  \u201cwithout  project\u201d  framework  was  adopted.  The \neconomic internal rate of return of the project is 14.1%, above the economic hurdle rate of 9%. \nSensitivity analysis demonstrates that the project\u2019s expected economic performance is somewhat \nsensitive to demand growth. However, the analysis considers that the benefits of the project are \nnot expected to be fully realized until further investments are made to improve the distribution \nsystem in Kathmandu Valley.  \n \nC.  Governance \n25.  The assessment of NEA\u2019s financial management, prepared in 2014, was updated in \naccordance  with  ADB  guidelines.17 Key  financial  management  risks  include  (i)  the  current \nspreadsheet-based accounting system, which is inflexible, prone to errors, and inadequate for an \nentity of NEA\u2019s size and complexity; (ii) inflated assets and liabilities requiring write-down; and (iii) \ninadequate resolution of audit issues, among others. A further concern arises from the foreign \nexchange risk on development partner loans, including those of ADB, being transferred to NEA. \nA time-bound financial management action plan has been developed and agreed upon with the \ngovernment and NEA, and will be implemented in close consultation with ADB.18 Based on the \nabove, NEA\u2019s overall pre-mitigation financial management risk is substantial.  \n \n26.  A procurement capacity assessment of NEA was conducted as part of the due diligence. \nNEA has sufficient capacity and experience in local and foreign procurement, including ADB \nstandard bidding procedures, under domestic projects and external assistance from international \n                                                \n15 ADB. 2005.

The  results  of  the  integrity  due  diligence  conducted  for  NEA  were \nsatisfactory. \n \n27.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and NEA. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social  \n28.  Nepal\u2019s per capita gross domestic product is one of the lowest in the world at around $766. \nMost of the country\u2019s population (about 80%) live in rural areas where poverty is more prevalent \nand severe. The Government of Nepal, through the Sustainable Development Goal #1, aims to \nfurther reduce poverty significantly by the end of 2030. However, limited access to modern energy \nresources and inefficient grid connectivity have been hindering development. The project aims to \nenhance the distribution capacity and improve the reliability and quality of electricity supply in the \nKathmandu Valley. The project will also relieve the existing distribution system of overloading and \nhelp reduce technical losses in the project areas. This will improve the efficiency of energy use \nand grid connectivity, and control electricity leakage, as needed. Further, the project activities \nalso  create  employment  for  the  local  poor  and  socially  disadvantaged  people  during  the \nimplementation phase. People, including poor or vulnerable consumers and women, will benefit \nfrom the project thanks to jobs for skilled and unskilled labor during construction and beyond. \nMoreover, using cleaner energy will improve urban and rural air quality, people\u2019s health, living \nconditions, and the quality of life. The project includes a GESI action plan supported through the \nattached TA, which ensures participation in, access to, and benefits for women, the poor, and \nexcluded groups from the project activities. The TA aims to boost community awareness of safe \nand efficient electricity use, and provide energy-based enterprise development training to poor \nwomen members of electricity user cooperatives, and GESI capacity building for members of the \nNational Association of Community Electricity Users Nepal, which will help improve the livelihoods \nof poor communities. The project is classified as effective gender mainstreaming. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n29.  Environment.  The  project  is  classified  as  environment  category  B.  An  initial \nenvironmental examination was prepared following ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) \nand the government's environmental regulations, and disclosed on the ADB website on 8 May \n2017. Public consultations were held in the project areas, and more consultations with a special \nfocus on women and vulnerable groups will take place going forward. NEA will set up a grievance \nredress mechanism. The project is not expected to cause significant environmental impacts. \nPotential impacts may arise from earthmoving for new substations and from burying distribution \nlines. The potential impacts are temporary, predictable, and reversible and can be mitigated \nthrough adherence to national and international standards, design criteria, and implementation of \nenvironmental management plans (EMPs). The project is not located within or adjacent to cultural \nsites, national parks, sanctuaries, or protected areas. A 400 kV transmission line was identified \nas the associated facility of the project. Environmental and social assessments of the transmission \nline were prepared in accordance with Government of Nepal and ADB requirements, and no \nissues related to environmental management exist. The EMPs include budgets that are sufficient \nto ensure proper implementation of mitigation and monitoring measures. Environmental and \nsocial safeguard experts are included in the scope of implementation consulting services. NEA\u2019s \nPMD will supervise EMP implementation, and submit environmental monitoring reports to ADB \nsemiannually during construction and annually during operation. Contractors will be required to \ncomply with the EMPs during preconstruction and construction, closely monitored by a project \n ", "9 \nsupervision consultant and NEA. EMPs will be updated as necessary if unanticipated impacts are \nidentified  during  implementation.  NEA  has  experience  in  implementing  ADB  projects,  and \nsufficient  capacity  to  implement  the  environment  safeguards,  using  third-party  services  as \nnecessary. \n \n30.  Resettlement and indigenous peoples. The project is categorized as A for involuntary \nresettlement and C for indigenous peoples. Six substations require the acquisition of private land, \n22.62 hectares in total, which will affect an estimated 174 households with 997 people. Further, \neight  permanent  and four  temporary  structures  need  to  be  relocated.  Among the  affected \nhouseholds,  142  are  losing  more  than  10%  of  their  land.  Surface  disturbance  during  the \nconstruction of underground distribution lines and overhead line restringing will have temporary \nimpacts. Social surveys and consultations were undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement. The project\u2019s social impacts were adequately assessed, and compensation will \nbe paid to the affected people commensurate with the impacts. A resettlement plan covering all \ncomponents  was  prepared  and  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website  on  5 May  2017.  Budgetary \nprovisions are in place to compensate affected people, including non-titleholders, for their losses \nin  a  timely manner. The  loan  agreement  will  include  a  standard  assurance  related to  the \nresettlement impacts and social matters. NEA has its own environment division, which also covers \nsocial  aspects,  and  they  have  previous  experience  with  land  acquisition.  The  PMD  to  be \nestablished for the project will include a social specialist, and implementing consultants will be \nengaged to assist the PMD and strengthen its capacity. The implementation of the resettlement \nplan will be monitored and supervised by NEA and an external monitoring agency, and monitoring \nreports will be submitted to ADB semiannually. The resettlement plan covers due diligence for the \nindigenous peoples, and the project does not have any impacts on their dignity, human rights, \nlivelihood system, culture territories, or natural resources. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n31.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in \nthe risk assessment and risk management plan.19 The overall risk, after mitigation measures are \nput in place, is low to moderate. The integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh \nthe costs. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nPoor financial health of NEA  (i) NEA will submit a financial restructuring plan to the government to convert debt into \nequity, write down assets, and recover receivable arrears. (ii) A foreign exchange risk \nmanagement policy will be established. (iii) The government will exempt NEA from all \ntaxes and duties on project-related procurement, except for 1% customs levy on \nimported equipment and 13% value-added tax on construction. (iv) Annual inflation-\nlinked tariff adjustments, with lifeline tariffs, will be in place for poor consumers. \nWeak internal controls and  NEA will disclose on the project website the audited project financial statements, \ncorporate governance  project progress, procurement short lists, invitations for bid, and contract awards. A \nrisk-based internal audit manual will be approved and put in place. \nRegulatory function does not  (i) ETFC needs to evolve into an independent regulatory agency free from political \nensure cost-reflective tariffs  interference. To do so successfully, ETFC should receive advisory services and \n(wholesale and retail)  capacity building. (ii) The government is pursuing various policy reforms where the \nissue of cost-effective tariffs will be addressed.  \n                                                \n19 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nEnergy sector governance  NEA and the government will continue to implement reforms and obligations under prior \ndoes not evolve,  absence of  commitments to ADB and other development partners, and respond positively to the \neffective coordination, and  continuing policy dialogue with ADB in this regard.
