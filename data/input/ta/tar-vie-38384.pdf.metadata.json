During the Country Programming Mission from April to May 2004, the Government of \nViet Nam asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide advisory technical assistance \n(TA)1 to support the preparation of a law on gender equality. The TA Fact-Finding Mission2 \nvisited Viet Nam from 19 to 30 July 2004 and held discussions with the Government on the \ngoals, purpose, scope, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms \nof reference for consulting services. The peer review meeting in August 2004 endorsed funding \nfrom the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund. The Government confirmed the mission\u2019s aide \nmemoire on 23 August 2004. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n2.  The law on gender equality will address a comprehensive and cross-sector approach to \ngender equality, and promote an iterative, consultative, and gender-inclusive process of drafting \nlaws. The enactment of the law will support the reduction of both income and non-income \npoverty by (i) ensuring gender-equal access to assets, land property, finance, and business \nregistration, and (ii) strengthening pro-poor and inclusive good governance. Broad participation \nof stakeholders in the law drafting process, public consultation after the drafting stage, and a \npublic awareness and advocacy campaign after the law is proclaimed will improve the poor and \nwomen\u2019s legal awareness and knowledge.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  During the past decades, the socialist system created a foundation for gender equality in \nViet Nam. Viet Nam signed the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination \nagainst Women in July 1980; the convention was ratified in November 1981. Women in Viet \nNam have reached 68.9% of the level of human development in comparison with men, as \nmeasured by the gender-related development index. This is very close to the country\u2019s human \ndevelopment index rating of 0.691, indicating that gender disparities seem to largely correspond \nwith the country\u2019s level of human development. Women hold 27.3% of the seats in Parliament; \none of the highest rates among countries of similar income and human development levels.3  \n \n4.  Despite the Government\u2019s commitments and efforts, the persistence of gender-based \ndiscriminatory practices, weak enforcement of the existing laws and regulations, and women\u2019s \nlimited awareness and  knowledge of their rights, constitute critical impediments to the full \nrealization of gender equality. The National Strategy for the Advancement of Women in Viet \nNam by 2010 aims to promote women\u2019s rights and gender equality in critical areas, including \nlabor and employment, education, health care, and decision making. Ensuring the realization of \nwomen\u2019s rights and benefits is one of the five major objectives of the ongoing National Plan of \nAction for the Advancement of Women: 2001\u20132005.  \n \n5.  The  Comprehensive  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Strategy  (CPRGS)  identifies \ninsufficient access to the law and protection of an individual\u2019s legitimate rights as one cause of \npoverty. As powerlessness and vulnerability are significant factors of non-income poverty, the \nCPRGS emphasizes the empowerment of women and the need to improve their access to legal \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the Internet edition of ADB Business Opportunities on 5 August 2004. \n2  Comprising  Y.

Against this background, the fourth meeting of the National \nAssembly in 2003 adopted a resolution to draft and promulgate a law on gender equality. \nSubsequently  in  April  2004  the  National  Assembly  appointed  the  11-member  Drafting \nCommittee4 headed by the president of Viet Nam Women\u2019s Union (VWU), who also chairs the \nNational Committee for the Advancement of Women. The Drafting Committee will be supported \nby a 12-member working group with members drawn from the same ministries and offices of the \nDrafting Committee members. The VWU vice president (director, Law and Policy Department) \nwill head the working group; and the deputy director, Law and Policy Department, VWU, will act \nas member-secretary. VWU has the institutional responsibility to lead the drafting of the law.  \n \n6.  Achieving gender equality in the legal system involves addressing several issues. First, \nthe existing laws and regulations have disparities, contradictions, and inconsistencies. Since the \nintroduction of a market-oriented economy, explicit gender gaps and disparities emerged. A \nchallenge in addressing these matters is how to balance equality, protection, and affirmative \naction, while ensuring women\u2019s interests. Other matters such as trafficking in women and \nchildren, migration, and gender-based violence, while addressed under the relevant laws, are \nnot dealt with in a comprehensive and unified manner.  \n \n7.  Second,  the  effective  application  and  execution  of  laws  depend  largely  on \nimplementation and enforcement systems and procedures. Currently several agencies such as \nthe National Committee for the Advancement of Women, National Legal Aid Agency, and VWU, \nhave a mandate to (i) respond to the needs of the poor and socially vulnerable by providing \nlegal information, awareness, education, and representation; and (ii) protect women\u2019s rights and \ninterests. However no agency has been assigned an explicit role to enforce gender equality \nunder  the  law  or  to  monitor  adherence  to  the  laws  and  regulations. No  system  exists  to \ndetermine  compliance of  newly  drafted  laws  and  regulations  with  the  principles  of gender \nequality and nondiscrimination, nor has any review been performed to determine if already \nenacted laws and regulations comply with the principles of gender equality. No systematic \nreview has been done of currently existing laws and regulations to identify those needing \namendments.  \n \n8.  Third, weak law enforcement results from both ignorance of the law and lack of capacity \nof the implementing and enforcing agencies. Little knowledge and awareness of legal rights by \nthe population is also a serious constraint. Furthermore, accessibility to legal support and \nservices by the poor, including women, is severely limited. The law on gender equality will \nrespond to these challenges. The law will provide a coherent framework to integrate gender \nequality within the substance of the laws, legal structures, institutions, and procedures.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n9.  The purpose of the TA is to support the Government to develop a law on gender equality \nwith a view to reducing poverty and inequality based on gender. The TA\u2019s specific objectives are \nto (i) facilitate the process of gender mainstreaming in drafting and amending legislation, (ii) \nbuild gender-sensitive legal institutions, and (iii) enhance gender awareness in the legal system.  \n \n                                                \n4  Members are the vice president of VWU (vice chairperson); vice ministers of the ministries of agriculture and rural \ndevelopment; education and training; justice; and labor, invalids, and social affairs; deputy chief justice of the \nPeople\u2019s Supreme Court; permanent secretary of the National Committee for the Advancement of Women, and \nrepresentatives from the Office of the National Assembly, Office of the Government, and Fatherland Front. ", "  3\n10.  The expected outputs of the TA will be (i) a draft comprehensive law on gender equality \nthat  will  support  the  repealing  of  gender-biased  and  conflicting  laws  and  regulations;  (ii) \ndevelopment of suggested gender-sensitive systems and procedures; (iii) increased gender-\nawareness by the judiciary, law enforcement, administrative personnel, and the legal profession; \nand (iv) enhanced legal literacy of the poor, especially women. The TA conforms with ongoing \nmulti-agency-supported assistance for legal system development and amendment of the civil \ncode, for which ADB is also providing advisory TAs.5 \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  Many  factors  limit  women  from  enjoying  their  full  legal  rights  and  benefits.  The \nconstraints are often quite separate from the substantive nature of the law itself\u2014the provision \nand content of the law. In many cases, the factors underlying the persistence of gender-based \ndiscrimination are extralegal, and therefore are not able to be fully reflected in legal terms. In \nrecognition of this situation, the TA will address three interrelated factors of the legal system: (i) \nsubstantive factors, such as the lack of appropriate laws, gender-biased and discriminatory laws \nand regulations, and contradictory and inconsistent provisions within existing laws; (ii) structural, \ninstitutional, and procedural factors, such as the judiciary, enforcement, and administrative \nagencies\u2019  functions  and  roles;  and  (iii)  sociocultural  factors,  such  as  shared  attitudes, \nperceptions, knowledge, and behaviors toward the laws and legal/judicial systems. The TA\u2019s \napproach and key activities are designed to address the first two factors, while touching upon \nthe  third  in  a  limited  way  through  pre-  and  postdrafting  public  consultations  and  public \ncampaigns once the law is proclaimed. The TA is designed to achieve the following distinctive, \nyet interlinked objectives.  \n \n1.  Conduct a Diagnostic Analysis \n12.  The initial review will focus on the latest documents and reports on gender equality in \nlegal systems, in particular, the findings and outcome of recent research commissioned by the \nSocial Affairs Committee of the National Assembly. Supplementary research and analysis will \nbe conducted only for the areas/issues where information is found insufficient. Concurrently, \nexisting laws on gender equality and their implementation and enforcement systems in the \ncountries that have enacted such laws will be studied. Based on the diagnostic analysis and \ndeemed needs, a study visit to relevant countries in the region, may be made. \n \n13.  In  line  with  the  CPRGS,  broad  and  rigorous  stakeholder  consultations  will  be  fully \nintegrated  in  the  scope  of  the  TA.  The  activities  will  encompass  (i)  identify  the  specific \nstakeholders and stakeholder groups, (ii) plan and design consultation workshops, (iii) conduct \nconsultations, (iv) compile and analyze the results and findings, and (v) consolidate information \nand prepare the report.  \n \n14.  Stakeholders  are  expected  to  include  judiciary;  law  enforcement  agencies;  and \nadministrative  staff  at  the  national,  provincial,  district,  and  commune  levels;  lawyers,  bar \nassociations, and paralegals; officials of alternative dispute resolution systems; members of \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2002.

Manila]. on 16 January 2003).  \n ", "4  \ntrade unions and mass organizations; ethnic minority groups; civil society; and networks such as \nthe Gender Action Partnership. The key concerns and suggestions of the stakeholders will be \nexamined and reflected in the drafting process. The findings of participatory consultations will be \nshared at different stages of the validation process of the draft law and fed back to groups \ndrafting the law and working on awareness raising and public advocacy. \n \n2.  Draft the Law on Gender Equality \n15.  The scope of the TA activities includes identification of key issues to be addressed by \nthe law; deliberations within the working group; and drafting of the law. Expert support will be \nprovided to the working group to deepen the understanding of experiences in countries that \nalready have a law on gender equality or similar legal provisions. The main focus at this stage is \nto provide sufficient information and analysis to the working group for them to define the format \nand content of the law. The TA will also recommend amendments to other relevant laws and \nregulations. In addition, the TA will facilitate the consultation and feedback process at various \nstages of the process.  \n \n16.  Legal structures and procedures have considerable impact upon the implementation and \nenforcement of laws. The TA will, in line with expansion of legal support for the poor stipulated \nin  the  CPRGS,  support  the  assessment  of  the  structural  and  procedural  factors  of  law \nenforcement, and identify flexible and efficient forms of support for women to have easy access \nto legal services, including dispute resolution. The TA will assess the effectiveness and gender-\nresponsiveness  of  the  present  implementation  and  enforcement  mechanisms,  and  identify \noptions for possible inclusion in the draft law on gender equality. The ultimate goal will be to \ndevelop a mechanism and procedures that serve the needs and interests of women and realize \ngender equality.  \n \n3.  Conduct Awareness Raising and Public Advocacy \n17.  The third critical factor for ensuring that the law operates in a fair and equitable way for \nwomen is the culture of the law, i.e., the way people regard and interpret the law. Focused \ngender sensitization, awareness raising, and public campaigns will be conducted for major \nstakeholder groups before and after the law on gender equality is proclaimed. The findings of \nthe  diagnostic  analysis  and  stakeholder  consultation  results  will  be  fully  reflected  in  this \ncomponent.  \n \n18.  Legal processes often disadvantage women, especially poor women and those from \nindigenous and ethnic minority groups. They are frequently unaware of their rights and the very \nexistence of the law. Indifference of officials, community and family pressures, and limited \nmobility, all can play a part in leading to this outcome. The TA will aim to improve women\u2019s legal \nliteracy  and  better  awareness  of  the  role  of  the  judiciary,  and  administrative  and  law \nenforcement agencies. Specific awareness raising and targeted legal literacy programs will be \ndesigned and carried out upon completion of the draft law on gender equality. A national public \ncampaign and advocacy program will be conducted on the key provisions of the law after its \npromulgation.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n19.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $465,000 equivalent of which $230,000 is the \nforeign exchange cost and $235,000 equivalent the local currency cost. The Government has \nrequested ADB to finance $370,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost and ", "  5\n$140,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the \nPoverty Reduction Cooperation Fund. The Government will finance the balance of the local \ncurrency cost, equivalent to $95,000, through the provision of counterpart and support staff, \noffice  accommodation,  and  other  related  services  and  facilities.  Cost  estimates  and  the \nfinancing plan are presented in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  VWU will be the Executing Agency for the TA and the deputy director, Law and Policy \nDepartment (member-secretary of the working group) will be the TA director. The TA director \nwill liaise between the working group and the TA consultants. The VWU vice president (vice \nchairperson of the Drafting Committee and chairperson of the working group) will give overall \nguidance and oversee the implementation of all TA activities. The TA consultants will be located \nin the VWU premises. VWU will assign counterpart staff to work closely with the TA consultant \nteam.  \n \n21.  The TA will be implemented over 22 months from March 2005 to December 2006, and \nwill  require  29  person-months  of  consulting  services:  9  person-months  of  international \nconsulting for (i) legal drafting and (ii) legal system development; and 20 person-months of \ndomestic consulting for (i) sociolegal issues, (ii) participatory consultation, (iii) legal drafting, and \n(iv)  public  advocacy.  The  consultants  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the \nengagement of domestic consultants. The consultants will be recruited as individuals. Appendix \n3 gives the outline terms of reference for the consultants. The consultants will submit inception, \ninterim, and final reports, and quarterly progress reports to ADB. An indicative implementation \nschedule and reporting requirements are in Appendix 4. ADB will finance equipment for the TA \nin accordance with the ADB Guidelines for Procurement.  \n \n22.  Dissemination  of  the  TA\u2019s  outputs  is  integrated  in  the  scope  of  the  TA  as  public \nconsultations  following  the  drafting  of  the  law  and  its  proclamation,  a  public  awareness \ncampaign, and targeted awareness raising for the major stakeholders (para. 18). In addition, a \nseries of stakeholder consultative workshops will serve as a venue for disseminating the outputs \nat various stages of the TA. Evaluation of the outcomes will be integrated into the Government\u2019s \nperiodic reports to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against \nWomen and the annual report of the National Plan of Action for the Advancement of Women.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $370,000 to the Government \nof Viet Nam to be financed on a grant basis by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund for \nSupporting the Preparation of the Law on Gender Equality, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard. \n \n ", " \n  6\n \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \n  A\np\np\nAssumptions  en\nDesign Summary  Performance Indicators/Targets  Monitoring Mechanisms  d\nand Risks  ix\n 1\nGoal  By 2010       \n       \nAchieve equality between women and  Passage of the law on gender equality  Government document   \nmen under the rule of law to reduce  by November 2006  Law bulletin   \npoverty and develop a law on gender     \nequality with effective implementation  Legal system and framework to  Report of the Convention on the \nand enforcement mechanisms.   protect women\u2019s rights and provide  Elimination of All Forms of \n  benefits on an equal footing with men  Discrimination against Women \n   \nReport of the National Committee for \nthe Advancement of Women \n \nPurpose         \n      Assumption \nSupport drafting of the law on gender  The preliminary draft of the law on  Government document  The Government is fully committed \nequality.  gender equality developed and    and has the capacity to develop the \nsubmitted to the Ministry of Justice by    law.  \nJuly 2005     \n    Risks \nThe revised draft of the law on gender  The working group representing \nequality submitted to the National  various ministries and offices may \nAssembly by November 2005  have different views on gender and \n  gender equality and have difficulty \nThe final draft of the law on gender  reaching a consensus on the content \nequality submitted to the National  of the law.  \nAssembly by November 2006   \n \nOutputs       \n      Assumption \nLaw on gender equality triggers the  Promulgation of the law on gender  Legislation  Members of Parliament generally \nrepeal of gender-biased and  equality by December 2006    support the draft law.  \nconflicting laws and regulations.       \n      Risk \n      Debate and decision making is \n      prolonged. \n       \nContinued on next page ", " \nAssumptions \nDesign Summary  Performance Indicators/Targets  Monitoring Mechanisms \nand Risks \n       \n7\nTechnical reports are prepared on       \n \n\u2022  law and gender: key issues  May 2005  Technical assistance (TA) consultants\u2019 \nand constraints,    reports \n\u2022  participatory consultation  March 2005  Reports of review missions  A\nplan,      pp\n\u2022  report on participatory  Interim: October 2005  e\nn\nconsultation,  Final: October 2006  d\n    ix\n \n\u2022  report on the law on gender  July 2005   1\n \nequality, and   \n   \n\u2022  report on public advocacy.
