Asian Development Bank (ADB)\u2019s support for strengthening Sri Lanka\u2019s public finances \nbegan in October 1999 with the approval of the Strengthening Public Expenditure Management \nSystems  technical  assistance  (TA)  project.1 Key  contributions  under  the  TA  included  the \ndevelopment of a budget accounting software system still in use today, improved budget and \nplanning procedures, and improved investment planning. This was followed in August 2002 with \nthe  Public  Sector  Resource  Management  TA  project.2 It  provided  background  studies  and \nrecommendations for modernizing the revenue administration. In December 2004 and based on \nthe TA findings, the Fiscal Management Reform Program (FMRP)3 was approved. The FMRP, a \nsector development program, principally focused on restructuring and modernizing the revenue \nadministration.  \n \n2.  The FMRP was closed in June 2008 following the release of the third and final tranche. \nThe closing deadline for the accompanying investment and TA loans has been extended to \ncontinue the support for ongoing procurement and capacity-building initiatives. The FMRP led to \nthe successful transformation of the revenue department, improvement of revenue collection, \nand narrowing of the country\u2019s fiscal deficit. The Sri Lanka country operations business plan \n(2007\u20132008) of October 20064 included a TA project to prepare the second phase of fiscal \nmanagement for 2007. The Sri Lanka country operations business plan (2008) of February \n20085 includes  the  same  TA  for  2008  and  the  Fiscal  Management  and  Service  Delivery \nProgram as a firm loan for 2009.  \n \n3.  In December 2007, a mission to review the third tranche of the FMRP held a preliminary \ndiscussion with the Government on a potential follow-up program of the FMRP. Subsequently, \nin May 2008 and at the request of the Ministry of Finance and Planning (MOFP), another review \nmission held follow-up discussions with the Government on the scope of a follow-up second \nphase, i.e., Deepening of Fiscal Management Reform Program and required preparatory work. \nThe project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) was prepared based on the mission\u2019s \nfindings.6 This PPTA is consistent with the Sri Lanka country strategy and program (2004\u2013\n2008),7 which focuses on three main areas (i) economic reform, (ii) governance, and (iii) social \ndevelopment.8 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Important achievements under the FMRP include the modernization of the revenue \nadministration leading to the restructuring of the three revenue departments and adoption of \nhuman resource management plans to include the introduction of (i) job descriptions for senior \ngrade positions, (ii) performance appraisal system, (iii) guidelines for merit-based appointments, \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1999.

Country Strategy and Program (2004\u20132008): Sri Lanka. Manila. \n8  The draft Sri Lanka country partnership strategy (2008\u20132011) focuses on two main pillars\u2014strengthening of the \ninvestment climate and socially inclusive development. Governance, including capacity building, is one of the two \nmain crosscutting themes. \n ", "2 \n(iv)  guidelines  of  promotion  schemes,  (v)  recruitment  of  staff,  and  (vi)  development  of  an \nextensive training program for cadres. In addition, as part of increasing tax effort, 79,000 new \ntax files have been opened since 2006, including nearly 4,000 for public servants. These are \nexpected to increase income tax revenues over the medium term. This follows a situation where \nno civil servant was liable for non-pay-as-you-earn income tax prior to the FMRP. Important tax \nholidays under the Board of Investment Act have been removed in preparation for strengthening \ncorporate income tax. These measures have led to an estimated average increase in revenue \ncollection of 16.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) during 2005\u20132007 from 15.3% in 2004. \nFiscal reporting activities were enhanced significantly, including the issuance of the Fiscal \nManagement  Report 9  which  includes  the  Government's  medium-term  fiscal  framework, \ncontingent liabilities, variance analysis of revenue collection and expenditures, and underlying \nassumptions supporting the fiscal framework. \n \n5.  Despite the Government's continued efforts and achievements under the FMRP, Sri \nLanka's fiscal reform program is not complete. The fiscal deficit\u2014while having been reduced \nfrom 8.2% of GDP in 2004 to 7.7% in 2007\u2014requires further consolidation to restore economic \nfundamentals and thereby enhance macroeconomic stability. From a welfare position, national \ndebt remains large, despite having declined from 106% of GDP in 2004 to 86% in 2007. Interest \npayment  on  this  debt  continues  to  absorb  a  large  share  of  current  expenditure\u2014thereby \ndiverting it from more productive or welfare-enhancing objectives. \n \n6.  Expenditure containment measures have faced the greatest hurdles. While the FMRP \nwas successful in introducing expenditure ceiling frameworks and notions of performance-based \nbudgeting, public expenditure as a share of GDP has not stabilized. Reasons behind this reflect \nGovernment policy priorities, including Government attempts to insulate the population against \nincreases in international prices of fuel, food, fertilizer, and other inputs through price subsidies. \nThe  impact  of  the  conflict  on  security  spending  has  also  led  to  limited  progress  on  the \nexpenditure  front.  Finally,  efforts  under  the  FMRP  to  reduce  expenditure  by  restructuring \nministries have made little progress. Looking forward, the Government now has a majority in \nParliament that should increase the likelihood of confronting politically sensitive expenditure \ncompression measures. The elimination of fuel subsidies announced in the 2008 budget and \nintroduced in late May 2008 may be the first of such measures. The following areas are \nidentified for review under the PPTA. \n \n7.  Public Expenditure Reviews. Expenditure rationalization requires an in-depth review of \ntrends in spending; analysis of breakdown of spending; and most importantly, effectiveness of \nspending. Three sectors are targeted\u2014agriculture, education, and health. These three sectors \naccount  for  the  majority  of  public  spending; and  more  critically,  overlap  between  national, \nsubnational, and provincial government spending decisions for education and health could be \nsignificant. The PPTA will develop background studies that target fiscal consolidation measures \nincluding preparation of PERs to identify savings from unproductive and even duplication of \nspending  across  selective  central  ministries  and  between  central  and  provincial \nadministrations.10 In  addition,  as  part  of  the  PER,  the  PPTA  will  analyze  the  impact  of \nGovernment subsidies and whether these can be improved through a review and, possibly, \nbetter targeting.  \n \n8.  Service  Delivery  Framework.  Any  implementation  of  additional  fiscal  consolidation \nmeasures will need to safeguard the quality of service delivery. Accordingly, the PER will have \n                                                 \n9   Ministry of Finance and Planning, Government of Sri Lanka. 2007. Fiscal Management Report 2008. Colombo. \n10 The PER will build on the previous World Bank-supported PER of June 2006. \n ", "3 \nto be complemented by an assessment of the quality and outreach of existing government \nprovision of key goods and services. This will build on previous work undertaken under the \nFMRP to develop results-based budget indicators.11 The PPTA will give careful consideration to \nthe sequencing of PERs with the development of a service delivery framework to ensure that \nany  rationalization  effort  will  not  affect  service  delivery  quality.  This  will  be  paramount  for \nreaching  a consensus on  moving  forward  on the  fiscal consolidation  agenda.  The  service \ndelivery framework will target the agriculture, education, and health sectors. \n \n9.  Management Audit. A management audit department was recently established as part \nof MOFP restructuring. The department is now seeking advisory support to roll out key functions \nassigned to it, including developing performance-based budget auditing and assessing financial \nmanagement of treasury operations. The PPTA is expected to adopt best international practices \nto  develop  systems  and  procedures  in  these  areas  to  improve  ex-post  monitoring  and \neffectiveness of public spending. \n \n10.  Treasury Fund Transfer System (TFTS). A significant achievement under the FMRP is \nthe development of a centrally managed TFTS to strengthen the Treasury Department\u2019s cash \nmanagement system. Direct benefits include increasing the speed of collecting and processing \nreceipts, and increasing supervisory capabilities at MOFP, other ministries and departments. \nMOFP  envisages  deepening  reforms  under  the  TFTS  and  comparing  international  best \npractices to include extending work into a treasury single account system as a step to the \ndevelopment  of  the  public  accounting  and  financial  management  information  system. \nAccordingly, the combination of background studies on PER, service delivery, management \naudit functions, and TFTS will serve to establish a robust and complete approach to improve \nexpenditure management and safeguard the quality of overall spending.   \n \n11.  Revenue  Administrations  at  Provincial  Councils.  Fiscal  decentralization  remains \nbeset by imbalances between spending powers and limited efforts by provincial administrations \nto  develop  their  own  revenue.  Recommendations  under  the  FMRP  are  gradually  being \nimplemented. While provincial administrations have made recent improvements to increasing \ntheir own revenue, selective provincial councils will need to identify new policy and institutional \nmeasures  to  reduce  dependency  on  central  transfers  and  expand  financing  of  public \ninfrastructure.   \n \n12.  Capacity Development. Institutionalizing capacity development is another key area that \nthe Government has requested continued support from ADB. The FMRP gave an impetus to \nthis area that was neglected for a considerable period of time. A cross-section of officers \nworking on fiscal management at MOFP and revenue departments in all grades got intensive \ntraining under the FMRP, in Sri Lanka as well as abroad. While foreign training is the most \neffective option for certain subjects, there is also a need to setup a dedicated training institution \nin Sri Lanka. This institution is expected to facilitate training and knowledge enhancement in the \narea of public fiscal management on a sustainable basis in order to improve the overall quality \nof the services provided by them.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n11 It will also provide continuity to work supported by the World Bank to improve primary education.  \n ", "4 \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n13.  The PPTA will support the preparation and design of the proposed program which is \nenvisaged to deepen and enlarge reforms under the FMRP and ensure that the Government \nhas  relevant  analysis  and  information  for  effective  decision-making  in  support  of  fiscal \nconsolidation and, in particular, contribute to achieving the Government's revised target of a \nfiscal deficit of 5% of GDP and a national debt of 82% of GDP by 2010.12   \n \n14.  The PPTA will develop background studies to provide inputs for the design of a policy \nframework to support (i) continuity of reforms initiated under the FMRP (i.e., strengthening \nrevenue-generating efforts at selected provincial councils); (ii) deepening of reforms following \nthe FMRP (i.e., application of PERs, extension of the TFTS, and establishment of a training \ninstitution for public fiscal management); and (iii) complementary reforms following the FMRP \n(i.e.,  developing  capacity  for  management  audit  functions  of  MOFP  and  developing  the \nfoundations for a service delivery framework).  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n15.  The  PPTA  will  assist  in  identifying  core  expenditure  containment  measures, \ncomplemented  by  medium-term  revenue  measures,  to  support  the  Government's  fiscal \nconsolidation program. On the expenditure side, expected outputs include developing (i) a \ncomprehensive  review  of  public  expenditures  in  three  sectors\u2014agriculture,  education,  and \nhealth with the objective of identifying expenditure containment measures in the sectors; and (ii) \na proposal for developing management audit functions at MOFP to develop improved systems \nand methods to increase effectiveness of spending and enhance reporting on public spending. \nOn the revenue side, the PPTA will prepare an assessment and a blueprint for moving to a \nmodernized and streamlined revenue administration in two provincial councils. These fiscal \nsupport measures will be complemented by developing (i) a concept paper to assess the state \nof service delivery in the three sectors, and a service delivery framework to ensure improved \neffectiveness and quality of service delivery over the medium term; (ii) a proposal for deepening \nTFTS reforms with the view to adopting best practices on extending the existing systems to a \ntreasury single account system, and building structure for development of a public accounting \nand financial management information system; and (iii) a proposal for the establishment of a \ntraining institution for sustainable capacity development in the area of public fiscal management. \n \n16.  The PPTA will have two parts. Part 1 will conduct a detailed needs assessment of the \nvarious components\u2014and in particular the deficiencies in the system\u2014by working closely with \nstakeholders and building on work undertaken by the Government and other development \npartners. Part 2 will design a sequenced policy and institutional development framework with \nspecific recommendations to address deficiencies identified by the needs assessment. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The PPTA is estimated to cost $360,000, of which $300,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government will \nprovide the equivalent of $60,000 to finance part of the local currency costs for counterpart staff, \n                                                 \n12 Ministry of Finance and Planning, Government of Sri Lanka. 2007.

The  Government  was \ninformed that the approval of the PPTA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing program. \nThe detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  The MOFP will serve as the Executing Agency for the PPTA and be responsible for \nPPTA implementation. A senior MOFP official, preferably from the Fiscal Policy Department or \nNational Budget Department, will be designated as the project director. A steering committee, to \nbe chaired by the secretary to the Treasury will be established and have representatives from \nthe  Fiscal Policy  Department,  National  Budget  Department,  National  Planning  Department, \nTreasury  Operations  Department,  and  Management  Audit  Department;  and  three  sector \ndirectors of the ministries of agriculture, education, and health. Revenue department heads of \nthe two provincial councils will be asked to attend meetings for relevant discussions. The \nsteering committee may invite other parties to attend its meetings, if necessary to achieve \nspecific PPTA objectives. The committee, which will meet at least once every quarter, will be \nmandated to (i) monitor and guide PPTA implementation, (ii) resolve issues that might arise in \nits execution and implementation, and (iii) review PPTA consultants\u2019 reports. Whenever possible, \nADB staff will attend the steering committee meetings as observers. \n \n19.  Consulting  services  required  for  the  PPTA  include  3  international  consultants  for  5 \nperson-months of international consulting and 10 national consultants for 20 person-months of \nnational consulting. The international and national consultants will be mobilized intermittently \nover 6 months. A consulting firm will be selected using the quality- and cost-based selection \nmethod with the simplified technical proposals. Three national consultants, namely one public \nexpenditure expert, one training expert, and one management audit expert, will be recruited \nindividually by ADB using the single-source selection method. The recruitment of the firm and \nthe individual national consultants will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for \nconsultants are in Appendix 3.  \n \n20.  The  MOFP  will  provide  office  space,  furniture,  and  logistical  and  all  administrative \nsupport necessary to implement the PPTA. Office equipment and software to be financed by the \nPPTA will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time). Equipment procured under the PPTA will be transferred to the Government \nupon  PPTA  completion.  The  PPTA  is  expected  to  be  implemented  over  6  months,  from \nNovember 2008 to May 2009. The PPTA findings will be presented in a workshop at the end of \nthe PPTA.  \n \n21.  The World Bank is currently processing a public sector capacity-building project, which is \nscheduled for approval in June 2008. While the proposed ensuing ADB program and the World \nBank project will both assist in strengthening public financial management capacity in a broad \nsense, subsector demarcation between the two projects is clear as the proposed World Bank \nproject comprises components that do not overlap with the ADB program (i) upgrading statistical \ncapacity at the Department of Census and Statistics, and (ii) improving audit standards at the \nAuditor General\u2019s Department.  \n \n22.  The PPTA is classified as a general poverty intervention. The initial poverty and social \nanalysis is in Appendix 4. \n \n ", "6 \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n23.

POVERTY ISSUES \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \n1.  Based on the country poverty assessment, the country partnership strategy, and the sector analysis describe how the \nproject would directly or indirectly contribute to poverty reduction and how it is linked to the poverty reduction strategy of the \npartner country. \n \nMahinda Chintana, the Government of Sri Lanka's comprehensive strategic development plan, 2006\u20132016, sets out a vision to \nensure Sri Lanka's long-term economic development and poverty reduction objectives. Infrastructure development, combined \nwith development of a knowledge economy, is at the core of the strategy. Medium-term financial stability with the gradual \nreduction of the long-standing budget deficit and national debt provides the macroeconomic foundations to support the strategy. \nThe Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act of 2003 underpins the Government's statutory commitment to fiscal stability and \nassociated reporting requirements. \n \nThe Fiscal Management Reform Program (FMRP), approved in December 2004, was designed to support the strengthening of \npublic finances by improving public resource and expenditure management systems, promoting fiscal discipline, and supporting \nfiscal decentralization. The FMRP has made important progress in such areas as increased revenue collection, reflecting the \nmodernization of the revenue administration, resulting in improved fiscal performance. The FMRP was closed in June 2008 \nfollowing the release of the third and final tranche. The Government has expressed interest in pursuing a follow-up program.  \n \nIn view of the rapidly changing and uncertain security situation during 2007 and more recently the Government's formal \ntermination of the cease-fire agreement in early January 2008, the completion of the country partnership strategy has been \ndelayed and is currently expected to be submitted for consideration by the Asian Development Bank\u2018s Board of Directors in \nAugust 2008. The latest country strategy and program update was issued in August 2005 prior to Mahinda Chintana and the \nformation of the current Government. The country strategy and program focuses on three areas (i) economic reform, (ii) \ngovernance, and (iii) social development. The Sri Lanka country operations business plan 2008 of February 2008a includes the \nproject preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) for the follow-up project: Preparing the Deepening of Fiscal Management \nReforms as a standby project for 2008. \n \nThe PPTA envisages contributing indirectly to poverty reduction through sustainable fiscal management and good governance. \nStrengthening fiscal management ultimately supports the development of a sustainable public service delivery mechanism that \ncontributes to improved social welfare and that, in turn, helps the poor. Furthermore, macroeconomic stability in general will \ncontribute to pro-poor economic growth, as opposed to macroeconomic turmoil, which often adversely affects the poor. The \nPPTA may also contribute to enhancing good governance and more effective use of targeting that can also serve to reduce the \nplight of the poor.  \n \nB.  Targeting Classification \n1.  Select the targeting classification of the project: \n \n General Intervention    Individual or Household (TI-H)   Geographic (TI-G)   Non-Income MDGs (TI-M1, M2, etc.) \n \n2.  Explain the basis for the targeting classification:  \n \nThe ensuing program will comprise a policy (program) component with a limited set of policy actions and a procurement \ncomponent, which does not have any targeted intervention. It may also include a capacity-building component.  \n \nC.  Poverty Analysis \n1.  If the project is classified as TI-H, or if it is policy-based, what type of poverty impact analysis is needed?  \n \nThe following will be conducted (i) the Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy will be reviewed and its consistency with the \nensuing program checked; (ii) analysis and assessment will be conducted with regard to the channels through which the \nprogram contributes to poverty reduction; (iii) analysis will be made if any of the program components can potentially affect the \npoor adversely, and measures will be developed if any.  \n \n ", "18  Appendix 4 \n \n2.  What resources are allocated in the PPTA/due diligence? \n \nNational consultants will be advised to assess the impact channels for poverty reduction in each subsector/component and to \nassess any unforeseen adverse effect on the poor.  \n \n3.  If  GI,  is  there  any  opportunity  for  pro-poor  design  (e.g.,  social  inclusion  subcomponents,  cross  subsidy,  pro-poor \ngovernance, and pro-poor growth)? \n \nNo specific design is planned at this stage since the PPTA focuses on upstream policy reforms such as reviewing expenditure \nmanagement at line ministries. Better targeting of subsidies will be reviewed in order to improve effectiveness as this may \ninclude an impact on the poor.  \n \nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \nA.  Initial Social Analysis \nBased on existing information: \n1.  Who are the potential primary beneficiaries of the project? How do the poor and the socially excluded benefit from the \nproject? \n \nRecipients of public services in general will be the potential beneficiaries. Benefits from macroeconomic stability and enhanced \nservice delivery will not discriminate against the poor and the socially excluded. \n \n2.  What are the potential needs of beneficiaries in relation to the proposed project? \n \nAssurances that public services do not deteriorate as a result of the public expenditure review.  \n \n3.  What are the potential constraints in accessing the proposed benefits and services, and how will the project address them? \n \nFiscal consolidation is politically sensitive and needs to be implemented judiciously. The PPTA will provide the background \nwork and detailed analysis to support informed decision-making and thereby facilitate implementation of measures to address \nfiscal shortcomings while improving the effectiveness of public spending and overall quality and outreach of service delivery.   \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Indicate the potential initial stakeholders.  \n \nMinistry of Finance and Planning, key line ministries, provincial councils, and taxpayers. \n \n2.  What type of consultation and participation (C&P) is required during the PPTA or project processing (e.g., workshops, \ncommunity mobilization, involvement of nongovernment organizations and community-based organizations, etc.)? \n \nWith regards to public expenditure review, stakeholders of respective sectors such as provincial councils and service recipients \nwill be consulted. Service delivery beneficiaries and providers will also be consulted. Workshops will be planned to disseminate \nthe outputs.  \n \n3.  What level of participation is envisaged for project design? \n     Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making         Empowerment \n \n4.
