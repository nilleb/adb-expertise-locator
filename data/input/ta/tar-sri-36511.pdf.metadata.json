INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Government of Sri Lanka has developed in 2002 a vision statement titled  e-Sri \nLanka: An ICT Development Roadmap.1 The goal is to take information and communications \ntechnology (ICT) to every village, citizen, and business and to transform the way government \nworks by using ICT.  The Government has requested, and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nhas agreed to provide, a pilot project to study the feasibility of achieving the goal.  The advisory \ntechnical assistance (TA) Fact-Finding Mission was fielded from 23 January to 3 February 2003 \nand reached an understanding with the Government on the objectives, scope, cost estimates, \nfinancing  plan,  and  implementation  arrangements  of  the  TA. 2 The  Fact-finding  Mission \nconsulted a range of stakeholders and prospective beneficiaries. \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  About 40% of Sri Lanka\u2019s population can be classified as poor or vulnerable to poverty. \nThis level of poverty has remained constant during the 1990s, despite a real gross domestic \nproduct growth rate of around 5% per annum. Moreover, the benefits of growth are not being \nevenly distributed throughout the country, as the most growth has been concentrated in the \nWestern Province.  Poverty is predominantly a rural phenomenon, with nearly 90% of the poor \nresiding in rural areas where vital information for survival and additional income is lacking.  \nTherefore, it is very difficult for the poor to share the benefits of economic growth as they do not \nknow what opportunities are available for them.   \n \n3.  ICT has enormous potential to improve the livelihoods of low income people by reducing \nthe cost of providing services to traditionally marginalized communities and facilitating the build \nup  of  constructive  social  capital.    ICT  contributes  to  poverty  reduction  by  enhancing  the \nefficiency  of  the  economy,  enabling  better  delivery  of  public  services,  and  creating  new \nemployment opportunities for the poor and disabled.  Access to information plays a crucial role \nin improving living conditions of the poor.  ICT promotes integration of isolated communities into \nthe global economy.  ICT improves the delivery of public services, which is especially important \nfor rural and isolated communities.  However, many poor and disabled people in Sri Lanka are \nnot able to benefit from ICT because of cultural barriers, low income, and lack of suitable \nfacilities.3  Due to high internet access fees and low computer ownership, internet use per 100 \ninhabitants is 0.78 in 2001 which needs to be increased. \n \n4.  About 900,000\u20131.4 million people are disabled in Sri Lanka.  In addition, about 10,000 \nsoldiers were disabled as a result of 20 years of internal conflict.  About 47% of the disabled \npopulation is under 14 years of age and their disabilities are related to prevailing conditions of \npoverty and malnutrition.  In Sri Lanka, people with disabilities who are also poor have had little \naccess to educational and training programs suited to their special needs.  In a country with a \nhigh unemployment rate, disabled people have few opportunities to compete for jobs  and \ntraining programs.  As computer-related jobs are new and relatively few people have been \ntrained in the country, some disabled people could have a good chance of being employed if \ntrained appropriately in information technology.  ICT can help overcome geographical barriers to \ncommunication,  simulate  expensive  and  risky  laboratory  experiments  at  low  cost  and  no \npersonal risk, provide tutoring, and offer a window to unforeseen markets.  Experience in other \ncountries  show  that  disabled  people  have  benefited  from  the  freedom,  support,  and \nopportunities offered through the use of computers. However, Sri Lanka has few training centers \nthat serve the poor and disabled. \n                                                 \n1  Ministry for Economic Reform, Science and Technology. 2002.  E-Sri Lanka: An ICT Development Roadmap. \nColombo. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in August 2002. \n3  International Telecommunication Union data show computer ownership per 100 inhabitants was 0.79 in 2001.  \nTelephone lines per 100 inhabitants were 8.0 and internet hosts per 10,000 persons were 1.2 in 2001. ", "2 \n5.    ADB\u2019s assistance has been focused on reducing poverty in many sectors, but the poor \nhave not been provided vital information so they can plan effectively to escape the poverty trap.  \nADB and the World Bank promote computer literacy in the schools, but access is limited (only \n15 computers each to 1,200 of Sri Lanka\u2019s 10,000 schools) and computer teaching is basic.  No \nattempt has been made to provide vital information through the Internet to the rural poor, \nbecause of relatively high costs and lack of experience.  A pilot study is needed to test the \neffectiveness of information service to the poor and disabled people. \n \n6.    The most important determinants for the high incidence of poverty in Sri Lanka have \nbeen the 20-year war and a legacy of poor economic management.  The Government is fully \ncommitted to overcoming both of these challenges.4 The Government\u2019s long-term goals are to \nachieve prosperity through sustainable development, including a 50% decline in the level of \nabsolute poverty.  The Government and ADB agreed to the following strategic focus to reduce \npoverty: (i) creating opportunities for pro-poor growth, (ii) strengthening the social protection \nsystem,  and  (iii)  empowering  the  poor  and  strengthening  governance.    ADB  agreed  to \nconsolidate its assistance to seven sectors, including education, which contributes greatly in \nreducing poverty in Sri Lanka.  The summary initial poverty and social analysis report is in \nAppendix 1. \n \n7.    In the education sector, ADB has three ongoing projects and three projects are being \nprocessed. Under  the Skills Development Project,5 training institutes provide basic computer \ntraining  to  the  out-of-school  youths.  The  Secondary  Education  Modernization  Project6 \nintroduces computer education in secondary schools. The Science and Technology Personnel \nDevelopment Project7 promotes cooperation between universities and industries to improve staff \nquality and create more job opportunities.  The Distance Education Modernization Project ($45 \nmillion), planned in 2003, will increase educational opportunities for secondary school graduates \nwho  cannot  attend  conventional  universities,  through  distance  education;  and  a  school \ncomputerization project ($40 million) is in the pipeline for 2004.  The country strategy and \nprogram  includes  a  human  resource  investment  project  ($20  million)  for  2005.  Once  the \ninformation service to the poor has proved effective in reducing poverty, the concept will be \nincorporated into the ongoing and pipeline projects. \n \n8.  The Government drafted a plan to use ICT to develop Sri Lanka\u2019s economy, reduce \npoverty, and improve the quality of life and the opportunities for all people. ADB\u2019s country \noperational strategy emphasizes the importance of human development to promote continued \neconomic growth and closer integration into the global economy.  ADB\u2019s Policy on Education8 \nplaces  high  priority  on  improving  the  quality  of  education;  increasing  equity,  access,  and \nretention, especially for the poor, women, and other marginalized groups; and strengthening \nmanagement, governance, and efficiency.  The proposed TA is fully in line with ADB\u2019s education \npolicy and country strategy in that it aims to improve the quality of education, reduce digital \ndivide, and develop human resources for the information age.  \n \n                                                 \n4  Government of Sri Lanka, 2002.

The  Department  for \nInternational Development (DFID) strongly backed the TA. The Japan International Cooperation \nAgency (JICA) will closely coordinate with its ongoing TA, Science and Mathematics Education \nusing  ICT.  The  Korean  International  Cooperation  Agency  (KICA)  agreed  to  send  a  few \nvolunteers who will teach village people how to use of ICT. The United States Agency for \nInternational Development (USAID) endorsed the importance of the TA and wish to be kept \ninformed of developments.  The World Bank, which is implementing an ICT project for Sri Lanka, \nis keen to collaborate with ADB. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n10.  The goal of the TA is to create opportunities for the poor to participate in economic \ngrowth  by  providing  vital  information.  The  objective  is  to  test  two  community  information \nnetworks among district offices, schools, training institutes, job placement centers, hospitals, \nmarkets, private companies, and villages, to share vital information with the poor and disabled, \nusing cost-effective and feasible communication modes. Information needs of the community \nwill be analyzed. The types of information to be provided will include commodity and crop \nprices, job opportunities, education and training opportunities, health and medical information, \nweather and disaster warning, and public announcements. Such information is available, though \nscattered, in the country. Through the community information networks, community people will \nbe able to share information, monitor crop prices, order goods and services, consult doctors, \nenroll in distance learning classes, pay taxes, and get certificates.  The TA will be the testing \nground for electronic learning, commerce, medicine, and government services. The TA will \nprovide case studies on how these services can effectively reach to the poor and disabled. \n \n11.   The socially excluded poor and disabled will firstly receive vital information for their \nsurvival and well-being.  They will also be provided with livelihood information delivered through \nthe Internet and facsimile, (such as market prices of commodities they produce, suitable job \nopportunities, and free training opportunities) to prepare themselves to escape the poverty cycle. \nA number of computers will be reserved for the poor and disabled to guarantee their access to \nvital information at any time.  If the project is proven successful, nominal user fees will be \ncharged to sustain operation of the information network.  However, free access by the poor and \ndisabled will be maintained.  The TA may be extended to conflict areas to enhance social \nintegration  and  nation  building.    The  concept  will  be  introduced  in  other  ADB  projects.  \nEventually, operation of the network will be handed over to the community or private sector.  \n \n12.   The main target of the project is about 2,000 poor and disabled people residing in the \ntwo districts.  The poor and disabled people will be identified by the district office and verified by \nthe steering committee.  However, more than 20,000 people in the communities will participate \nin the project in one form or another. The project will show how the community can empower \ntheir poor and disabled people. This is especially important, as the social safety net is weak in \nthe country. \n \n13.  Key outputs of the TA will include  (i) two community  information centers (CICs), one \neach  in  Gampaha  and  Ratnapura  districts;  (ii)  two  community  web  sites;  (iii)  two \ncommunications networks, linking 16 village information centers (VICs) with two district CICs; \nand (iv) two case study reports on the establishment, operation, maintenance, and impact of \ncommunity information services.  With the TA, the capacity of the villagers to use computers \nand the Internet will be improved markedly, as well as information gathering, analysis, and \npackaging capacity.  The villages\u2019 abilities to use electronic communication will be enhanced. \nThe project framework is in Appendix 2. ", "4 \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.   The TA has three components: (i) establishment of two community information networks, \n(ii) capacity building for managing CICs and VICs and using ICT equipment, and (iii) provision of \ninformation services. The networks will be linked with the Internet, personal computers, personal \ndigital assistants, fax, standard phones, wireless phones, etc.  The TA will cover two districts, \nGampaha and Ratnapura.   Locations of CICs and VICs will be determined based on economic, \ngeographic, demographic data, and community involvement and their support. \n \n15.  Two community information networks will be established, one each in Gampaha District, \nand Ratnapura District, to test two models of community information services, one (i) based on \na public entity and one on the community and private sector.  The Gampaha network will be \nbased in a public school, linking mainly public entities, such as the district office, public rural \nextension  centers,  government  training  centers,  public  health  centers,  and  state-owned \nenterprises.  The Ratnapura network will be based on a community center, linking mainly private \nentities, such as private clinics, private schools and training centers, commercial banks, and \nprivate companies. The TA will explore how the poor can access the private services without \nmuch cost.  The maximum contribution from the relevant communities will be tapped to ensure \ntheir ownership and active participation.  Each case will be studied carefully and documented.  \n \n16.  Each network will be equipped with computers, printers, copiers, facsimile machines, \ntelephones, personal digital assistants, and Internet connections. Each network will develop a \ncommunity  web  site  to  collect  and  disseminate  information  in  three  languages:  English, \nSinhalese, and Tamil.  A management training program will be provided to operators of CICs \nand VICs.  Extensive training in the use of the equipment and Internet will be provided to key \noperators so that operation and maintenance of the networks can be handled by local operators \nby the end of the TA period (preferably, three months before the close of the TA). The \ncofinancier will train poor villagers to use computers and the internet. Considering the limited \ncapacity of the poor to use computers, and tutoring services will be provided. \n \n17.  Vital information will be collected daily by information collectors, based on analysis of the \ndemand for information.  The collected information will be analyzed, verified, and uploaded to \nthe web site immediately.  News will be disseminated daily to villages through electronic mail (E-\nmail) or facsimile to assure key information reaches target beneficiaries. Monthly newsletter will \nbe published in the three languages. By the end of the TA period the community operators will \ntake over information collection, analysis, and verification of information, uploading to the web \nsite, and publication of news. \n \n18.  The TA will be evaluated to assess its impact in terms of access, use, and cost of the \ninformation  services.    The  evaluation  will  be  documented  in  case  studies.  Cost  recovery \nmeasures  will  be  explored  extensively,  by  introducing  user  fees  and  paid  advertisements, \nsoliciting donations, and selling tea and snacks at the CICs.  Distribution of revenues will be \ndetermined by the steering committee of each district. Proper accounts will be maintained for \ninspection by the Executing Agency and ADB during TA implementation.  After completion of \nthe TA, the inspection will be done by each steering committee.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n19.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1.1 million equivalent, comprising $287,000 in \nforeign exchange and $813,000 equivalent in local currency cost. The Government of United \nKingdom  will  finance  $800,000  equivalent,  covering  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  of \n$237,000 and $563,000 equivalent of the local currency cost, on a grant basis, from the Poverty \nReduction Cooperation Fund. The TA will be administered by ADB. The Korea Agency for \nDigital  Opportunity  and  Promotion  will  cofinance  $100,000  on  a  parallel  basis.  The ", "    5 \nGovernment\u2019s contribution of $200,000 equivalent will be in kind.  The detailed cost estimates \nand proposed financing plan are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  The Ministry of School Education (MSE) will be the Executing Agency for the TA.  Two \nsteering committees will be organized from the stakeholders (such as representatives of the \ndistrict office, companies, schools, hospitals, and villages) in each district to guide MSE and the \nproject team.  The steering committees will recommend possible sites for CICs and VICs and \nreview types of information to be provided to the villagers based on the information needs of the \npoor. The steering committees will meet at least four times, during inception, interim review, the \ndraft final report stage, and at the end of the TA period.  The steering committees will review \ncase studies and oversee the smooth transfer of the information services from the TA team to \nthe villagers. \n \n21.  A team of 28 domestic consultants (for up to 420 person-months) will be recruited to \nprovide specialist services during the TA period, as there are qualified consultants available in \nthe country.  This is in line with the Government of United Kingdom\u2019s policy to finance the entire \nTA  for  local  consultants  without  the  participation  of  international  consultants.  International \nconsultants will be fielded by the cofinancier.  Key consultants, with their corresponding person-\nmonths in parentheses, include an information technology specialist and team leader (15),  \ncommunity  development  specialists  and  assistant  project  managers  (30),  network \nadministrators (30), web site designers (60), computer hardware technicians (30), information \ncollectors (150), newsletter writers (90) and a benefit monitoring specialist (15).  The outline \nterms of reference of the consultants are in Appendix 4. \n \n22.  The consultants will be engaged through a local firm by ADB using the quality- and cost-\nbased selection method, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The \nsimplified  technical  proposal  (STP)  format  will  be  used.  The  computers,  software,  office \nequipment, and motorcycles will be procured by the consulting firm in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  Procurement.  The  motorcycles,  office  equipment,  computers,  and  software \nprocured will be transferred to the communities on completion of the TA. \n \n23.  The TA will be implemented  during 15 months, from October 2003 through  January \n2005.  The consulting team will arrive in Gampaha and Ratnapura districts in October 2003 to \nimplement the TA.  The consultant will submit an interim report to MSE and ADB at the end of \nthe 4th month, the draft final report during the 12th month and the final report during the 15th \nmonth. \n \n24.  The MSE will appoint a TA manager and three counterpart staff to work with the team of \nconsultants recruited under the TA. The Government will also provide adequate office space \nand administrative support to the consultants. The TA will be closely coordinated with the on-\ngoing  Secondary  Education  Modernization  Project,  Skills  Development  Project,  and  the \nproposed School Computerization Project and Human Resource Investment Project. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n25.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering  the  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $800,000  to  the \nGovernment of Sri Lanka to be financed on a grant basis by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation \nFund for the Community Information Services for the Poor and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard.

The incidence of poverty is highest in households where the principle income earner has no \nschooling, lowest in those where the principle income earner is a university graduate. The TA takes into \naccount the access to and quality of education for the poor and disabled. To increase equal access to \nquality education, the project will provide timely information on educational opportunities to the poor in \nthe  selected  communities.    This  will  increase  awareness  of  education\u2019s  importance  in  career \nadvancement and contribute to reducing poverty and digital divide.   \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Proposed Classification: PI  \n \n \nAbout 40% of the population can be classified as poor in Sri Lanka. Poverty is predominately a rural \nphenomenon with nearly 90% of the poor residing in rural areas. Therefore, one of the central objectives \nof the Government is to restore economic growth and thereby effectively eliminate poverty in the country. \nSix major pillars of the Government\u2019s strategy for poverty reduction are (i) investing in people, (ii) creating \nopportunities for the poor to participate in economic growth, (iii) reducing conflict-related poverty, (iv) \nbuilding  a  supportive  macroeconomic  environment,  (v)  empowering  the  poor  and  strengthening \ngovernance,  and  (vi)  implementing  an  effective  monitoring  and  evaluation  system.  The  technical \nassistance (TA) will support the first two  pillars by teaching computer skills that will open opportunities \nespecially in the rural areas.  The provision of timely information on crop prices, disaster warning, and job \nopportunities will also contribute in reducing poverty. \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \n \nStakeholder Analysis: \n \nThe TA was developed through extensive consultation with central and local governments and rural \ncommunities. The TA also reflected the needs of community people, especially the poor and persons with \ndisabilities. To ensure local ownership of the TA community contribution was encouraged through school \ndevelopment  societies.  The  contributions  take  the  form  of  donation  of  cash,  supplies,  labor,  and \nexpertise.  In return, the TA will share its information and resources with the stakeholders and seek their \nactive involvement.  This consultation process will be continued during the TA implementation.   \n \nParticipation strategy required:   The selected stakeholders should be involved from the planning \nstage.  Therefore, a planning workshop with 50 stakeholders was organized during fact finding.  Two \nsteering  committees  will  be  organized  with  representatives  of  the  stakeholders  to  guide  the  TA \nimplementation. \n ", "    Appendix 1      7 \n \nD.
