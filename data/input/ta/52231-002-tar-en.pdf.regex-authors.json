The Safeguards Policy Statement (SPS) 2009 of the Asians Development Bank (ADB) \nrequires that ADB-funded projects are to achieve no net loss, or a net gain of affected biodiversity. \nProjects must identify measures to avoid, minimize or mitigate adverse impacts to natural or \nmodified habitat, and as a last resort, propose compensatory measures such as biodiversity \noffsets. \n2.  Biodiversity offsets are \u201cmeasurable conservation outcomes designed to compensate for \nsignificant  residual  adverse  biodiversity  impacts  arising  from  project  development  after \nappropriate  prevention  and  mitigation  measures  have  been  taken.\u201d1 Under  the  SPS,  the \nestablishment of a biodiversity offset requires the project developer to identify a suitable area of \nland that contains ecosystems comparable in size, quality and function to those impacted by the \nproject, and to ensure that the area is managed to deliver the required conservation outcomes.2 \n3.  International  research  indicates  mixed  success  in  terms  of  the  environmental \neffectiveness of biodiversity offset schemes.3 Ensuring that offset programs are appropriate for \nthe project, well-designed and implemented is crucial.4 Biodiversity offsets can be difficult to \nmonitor and verify and can suffer from high transaction costs and poor design.5 Successful \nbiodiversity offsets require effective planning and implementation, including appropriate selection \nof the offset site and a long-term commitment. To help to achieve no net loss through biodiversity \noffsets, biodiversity gains must be comparable to losses, be in addition to conservation gains that \nmay have occurred in absence of the offset,and be lasting and protected from risk of failure.6 \n4.  Biodiversity offsets are currently under-utilised in Asia.7 They present a challenge in \ndeveloping countries where effective environmental management can be difficult to achieve. This \nis compounded in the private sector where projects can have tighter timeframes and greater \nfinancial  pressures,  often  combined  with  inadequate  in-house  environmental  management \ncapacity.  \n5.  A number of international conservation organizations have extensive experience in the \npreparation of biodiversity management plans and associated management and administration. \nThey can also bring a high level of financial rigor to the process as money is not channeled \nthrough government accounts. This provides a viable option for ADB private-sector clients to \nachieve their safeguard requirements. \n6.  The Private Sector Operations Department (PSOD) has funded nine projects requiring \nbiodiversity offsets since the SPS came into force in 2010. All of these projects are currently in \nadministration, meaning that the offset programs are currently being planned or implemented. \nWith PSOD\u2019s growing operations, the number of biodiversity offset programs are likely to increase \ngoing forward.  \n                                                \n1  BBOP. 2012.

This presents a risk to the effective implementation of offset programs. It can lead to ADB \nfunds being diverted to third parties or government agencies for implementation, who may or may \nnot have the appropriate capacity or experience. It can also lead to escalating costs and \nbureaucracy, and difficulties in auditing the use of ADB funds. In one PSOD example, $1 million \nper year was provided to a Watershed Management and Protection Authority, and 80% of the \nallocation was used for salaries and administration.  \n8.  Given the long timeframe required for achieving measurable conservation outcomes there \nis the potential for ADB to have a significant number of projects that will be out of compliance with \nthe no net loss requirements 10-15 years after their approval. This presents an opportunity to \nprovide technical assistance to current or future PSOD projects to assist in the more effective \nimplementation of biodiversity offsets, to decrease the likelihood of future failure.  \n9.  If PSOD-funded projects are to deliver the no net loss requirements of the SPS it is \nessential that the offset areas are effectively managed and funded from the outset. Partnering \nprivate sector clients with an experienced conservation organization to manage offset areas is \npresented as a viable long-term solution. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SUBPROJECT \n \nA.  Overall Progress of the Technical Assistance Cluster \n10.  The TA cluster was approved on 23 August 2018. The TA cluster will be implemented over \n10 years, from January 2019 to December 2029.  \n \nB.  Subproject Scope  \n11.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Nam Ngiep 1 Power Company have \ndeveloped a Biodiversity Impact Mitigation and Offset Framework designed to ensure that the \nimpacts caused by the Nam Ngiep 1 Hydropower Project will result in no net loss of biodiversity \nor possibly a net gain.  \n12.  Achieving  effective  biodiversity  management  in  Lao  PDR  can  be  very  challenging. \nTherefore, a suitably qualified biodiversity conservation organization (the Service Provider) is to \nbe engaged to provide technical assistance for the detailed planning and implementation of the \nbiodiversity impact mitigation and offset measures outlined in the Biodiversity Impact Mitigation \nand Offset Framework for the Nam Ngiep 1 Hydropower Project. \nC.

OBJECTIVES \n \n9.  The overall objective of the Technical Assistance is to provide the necessary technical \nexpertise and competence in biodiversity conservation management to ensure achievement of no \nnet loss of biodiversity caused by the Nam Ngiep 1 Hydropower Project. \n \n10.  The objectives of the Technical Assistance are: \n \na.  to achieve no net loss in biodiversity within the NN1 sub-catchment and NCNX; \nb.  to build capacity of relevant authorities and other stakeholders to ensure long-term \neffective and efficient planning and implementation of biodiversity conservation \nmeasures  including  enforcement  measures  with  clearly  defined  conservation \nobjectives based on identified threats and risks; \nc.  to increase public understanding and support for the sustainable use of NTFP and \nwildlife resources, and to change behaviour of local community members to stop \nhunting and trading in rare or endangered species or other activities that threatens \nwildlife; \nd.  to facilitate control of access to restricted areas; \ne.  to build the capacity of law enforcement agencies and district administrations to \nenforce laws and regulations for protection and conservation of biodiversity. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nE.  METHODOLOGY AND IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS \n \n19.  NNP1PC will deploy a Site Manger to each of the sites (the Nam Ngiep 1 Sub-catchment \nand the NCNX Offset Site) together with technical staff of the Company who will work alongside \nthe Service Provider. \n \n20.  The Service Provider will work under the day to day supervision and instruction of the \nNNP1PC Site Manager and will act on behalf of NNP1PC on matters related to the implementation \nof the Nam Ngiep 1 Biodiversity Impact Mitigation and Offset Framework. \n \n21.  The role of the Service Provider is to support and assist the assigned government partners \nand NNP1PC on biodiversity conservation management to achieve the conservation objectives \nof the Nam Ngiep 1 Biodiversity Impact Mitigation and Offset Framework. It is therefore crucial \nthat work plans are developed and implemented through close collaboration and cooperation with \nNNP1PC and stakeholders. The Service Provider will be required to have regular communications \nand meetings with the various GOL partners and NNP1PC. \n \n22.  On the government side, for the work in Nam Ngiep 1 sub-catchment the main counterpart \nis the Watershed and Reservoir Protection Office and the officers of various government agencies \nassigned to support the implementation of the Framework. With respect to the work in Nam \nChouane-Nam Xang Offset Site, the main government counterpart is the Biodiversity Offset \nManagement Committee. \n \n \n \n ", "Facilitating Effective Biodiversity Offsets in Private Sector Operations-Subproject 1: NNP1 \nHydropower Project REG 52231-002 \n  3 \nF.  IMPLEMENTATION PERIOD \n \n23.  The Service Provider shall plan and execute the Scope of Work over a period of 10 years \nfrom January 2019 to end of December 2028. The aim is to gradually reduce the intensity and \nscope of services commensurate with the simultaneous build-up of capacity among the involved \nagencies and other stakeholders to effectively implement the necessary biodiversity conservation \nmeasures. \n \nG.  SCOPE OF WORK \n \n24.  The Scope of work of the Service Provider is divided into two components: \n \n1.  NNP1 Sub-catchment \n2.  NCNX Offset Site \n \n25.  The  scope  of  work for  these two  areas  are quite similar,  and  although  substantial \ninteraction between the two is expected and promoted, they will be implemented separately due \nto different government partners. \n \n1.
