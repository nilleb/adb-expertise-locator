I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan of up to B780 million or its equivalent in US dollars and (ii) the proposed administration of a \nloan to be provided by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Clean Technology Fund (CTF) of up \nto $15 million or the equivalent of 10% of project costs, whichever is less, both to Bangchak \nSolar Energy Company Limited for the Provincial Solar Power Project in Thailand. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n \n1.  Project Identification \n \n2.  The project is part of the corporate strategy of Bangchak Petroleum Public Company \nLimited (BCP) to expand its operations into renewable energy through limited-recourse project \nfinancing to become carbon neutral.  ADB provided financial assistance to BCP\u2019s first, 38-\nmegawatt (MW) solar power project in 2010 on a corporate finance basis.1 The first project is \nexpected to become fully operational by July 2012 and play an important demonstration role as \none of the first utility-scale solar power plants in Thailand.2 BCP plans to develop an additional \n80 MW of solar power capacity under its subsidiary, the Bangchak Solar Energy Company \n \nLimited (BSE), to become the largest solar power company in Thailand.  \n \n3.  If approved, the project will be the first time ADB mobilizes CTF cofinancing for a private \nsector project.3 The CTF provides scaled-up financing to demonstrate, deploy, and transfer low-\ncarbon technologies with significant potential to avoid greenhouse gas emissions over the long \nterm. It is channeled and administered through multilateral development banks, including ADB, \nand is one of the largest funds available to help developing countries fill gaps in financing \nclimate change mitigation.  \n \n4.  ADB will build on its recent experience to play a crucial role in helping BCP achieve its \nfirst limited-recourse project financing for renewable energy. Project finance is a logical next \nstep as it is the most appropriate form of financing for renewable power projects, despite its \ncomplexity. Project finance can strengthen the financial viability of clean energy projects and \noptimize their cash flow through longer tenors and advantageous debt sizing. The project will be \nmade  possible  by  the  confluence  of  three  main  factors:  (i)  BCP\u2019s  strategic  focus  and \ncommitment to renewable energy; (ii) the Government of Thailand\u2019s support through a strong \npublic\u2013private  partnership  regulatory  and  legal  framework  combined  with  a  sufficient  tariff \nregime;  and  (iii)  ADB\u2019s  long-term, fixed-rate financing  in  local  currency  combined  with  the \nexpected  CTF  cofinancing,  which  reduces  the  additional  costs  and  risks  associated  with \ninvestments in solar power. \n \n5.  As of January 2012, Thailand\u2019s installed power generation capacity was 31,447 MW. \nGeneration depends heavily on conventional fuels, with 64% produced by natural gas and 22% \nproduced by coal and lignite. Natural gas has traditionally been Thailand\u2019s reliable and low-cost \nsource of energy, but growing demand and dwindling reserves in the Gulf of Thailand mean the \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2010. Report and Recommendation to the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loans and \nTechnical Assistance for the Bangchak Solar Power Project. Manila (Loan 2628-THA and EI 7311-THA). \n2  The project consists of two plants with a capacity of 8 MW and 30 MW. The commercial operations date was \ndelayed by heavy flooding in 2011. \n3  For  information  on  the  CTF,  the  Climate  Investment  Funds  website  can  be  accessed  at \nhttp://www.climateinvestmentfunds.org. ", "2   \ncountry must begin the transition toward secure alternative sources. Fortunately, Thailand has \nabundant renewable energy sources: biomass, biogas, mini-hydro, solar, and wind. Using these \ndomestic sources of renewable energy can boost Thailand\u2019s energy security, save foreign \nexchange, and protect the country from global price fluctuations. As part of its strategy to \ndiversify  the  energy  mix  and  promote  renewable  energy,  the  government  prepared  the \nAlternative  Energy  Development  Plan,  2012\u20132021,  which  the  cabinet  approved  on  30 \nDecember 2011, and set a new target of generating 25% of primary commercial energy from \nrenewable energy sources by 2021. This would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 76 million \ntons per year. This target includes 9,201 MW of renewable energy capacity by 2021, of which \n2,000 MW is solar. As of 2011, only 169 MWof solar power capacity had reached commercial \n \noperation. To reach the target, the plan will encourage private sector development and the \npromotion of new technologies. \n \n6.  To complement its renewable energy strategy, the Ministry of Energy decentralizes \npower generation mainly by supporting the country\u2019s small power producer (SPP) and very \nsmall  power  producer  (VSPP)  programs,  which  are  public\u2013private  partnerships  that  buy \nrenewable energy from power plants to provide clean electricity to the grid. The SPP program \nallows private developers to build, own, and operate 10\u201390 MW power projects and enter into \npower purchase agreements (PPAs) with the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand. Under \nthe VSPP program, producers of up to 10 MW may sell power to the Metropolitan Electricity \nAuthority or the Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA). Renewable energy SPPs and VSPPs are \neligible for a feed-in tariff (or \u201cadder\u201d) in addition to the wholesale electricity price.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n2.  The Borrower and Sponsor \n \n7.  The  project  will  be  developed  and  operated  by  BSE,  a  special-purpose  company \nincorporated in Thailand that is 100% owned by BCP. BCP is a leading integrated oil refining \nand distribution company in Thailand with a long track record of adhering to principles of good \ncorporate governance and strong commitment to the environment and social responsibility. BCP \nowns and operates an oil refinery in Bangkok with a capacity of 120,000 barrels per day. BCP\u2019s \nretail business consists of a network of over 1,000 service stations, making BCP the third-\nlargest gasoline distribution company in Thailand and the leader in green fuels such as gasohol \nand biodiesel. BCP has become a role model in Thailand for its success in developing internal \nmechanisms that enhance transparency and accountability, including comprehensive reporting \non environmental and social indicators.4 BCP has initiated a proactive zero-carbon strategy that \ntracks  and  monitors  its  carbon  footprint  companywide  and  implements  strategies  to  offset \ncarbon emissions with the objective of reaching zero emissions. \n \n8.  BCP\u2019s major shareholder is the national oil company, PTT Public Company Limited, \nwhich owns 27%. Other shareholders are the Ministry of Finance (10%) and the public (63%) \ninvesting through the Stock Exchange of Thailand. In 2011, BCP generated B158.6 billion in \nrevenue and net income of B5.6 billion. Shareholders\u2019 funds are B29.9 billion and total assets \nB61.6 billion. BCP has a corporate rating from TRIS Rating Company Limited of A\u2013/stable.5 \n                                                \n4  BCP\u2019s corporate social responsibility reporting comprises full disclosure of its resource use and environmental \nfootprint, as well as the annual publication of environmental management accounting, which counts carbon dioxide \nemissions and other factors as costs to BCP. It publicizes its emissions and accident rates to the public on \nbillboards and at information centers. BCP  has won numerous awards for its high standards of corporate \ngovernance and corporate social responsibility. \n5  See  Implementation  Arrangements  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked  documents  in  Appendix  2)  for  more \ninformation on BCP. ", "  3 \n \n10.  ADB\u2019s review of BSE, a wholly owned subsidiary of BCP incorporated in Thailand to \noperate solar projects, did not give cause to believe that it was established or is being used to \nevade taxes across borders, launder money, or finance terrorism in the jurisdictions involved. \n \n \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n1.  Impact \n \n11.  The project's impact will be the diversification of Thailand's energy mix through the \naddition of renewable energy capacity6, helping the country progress towards its clean energy \ntargets.7 To achieve sustainable long-term economic growth, Thailand is promoting alternative \nsources of energy for power generation such as solar, and is beginning the transition to a low-\ncarbon economy. Solar is a secure, reliable, and sustainable source of electricity that diversifies \nthe country\u2019s energy mix, strengthening energy security and reducing reliance on fossil fuel. \n \n13.  The  project  also  contributes  to  the  acceleration  and  expansion  of  private  sector \ninvestment  in  clean  energy  infrastructure  in  Thailand.  It  is  expected  that  the  successful \nimplementation of the project and viable returns will attract other private sector investors in solar \nenergy projects. \n \n2.  Outcome \n \n14.  The project's outcome is the demonstrated viability and sustainability of a large solar \nproject in the private sector. The amount of carbon dioxide emissions avoided is an indicator for \nthe outcome, in addition to the usual financial and operational indicators. \n \n3.  Output \n \n15.  The output is the installation and operation of 32 MW of solar power generation.8 \n \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 \n \n16.  ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020 supports development that is environmentally sustainable and \nsupported by the private sector to meet growing energy demand in the region, capitalizing on \nADB\u2019s  operating  strengths  in  infrastructure  development,  finance,  and  other  areas.9 The \nstrategy supports the expansion of environment-friendly technologies for clean and efficient \nenergy generation and use, as well as a larger role for the private sector in infrastructure \nfinancing through public\u2013private partnerships. \n \n2.  Consistency with the Country Strategy \n                                                \n6  With this project of 32 MW, ADB will have contributed to 125 MW of solar energy capacity in Thailand. Earlier \nprojects are Natural Energy Development Limited (55 MW) and Bangchak (38 MW).  \n7  The government has established clean energy targets of 2,000 MW of solar power by 2021 and 25% of primary \ncommercial energy from renewable sources by 2021. \n8  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n9  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n ", "4   \n \n17.  ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Thailand, 2007\u20132011 has three core strategic \nareas:  infrastructure,  environmental  sustainability,  and  capital  markets.10The  government\u2019s \nAlternative Energy Development Plan, approved by the cabinet on 30 December 2011, notes \nthe immense energy potential of solar radiation in Thailand and the energy imports that can be \navoided through its use, with private sector investment. The project supports the government\u2019s \nlong-term objective for the Thailand Clean Technology Fund Investment Plan to utilize CTF \nresources to support renewable energy projects in the private sector.11 \n \n3.  Consistency with the Energy Policy \n \n18.  The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Energy Policy, which emphasizes investments in \nenergy efficiency, renewable energy projects, and wider access to energy.12 In 2013, ADB will \nraise its clean energy investment target to $2 billion per year from the present $1 billion to \naccelerate  low-carbon  growth  and  reduce  regional  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  The  policy \nunderscores ADB\u2019s continued financial and technical support for projects that qualify for carbon \ncredits under the Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol. Further, under the Asia \nSolar Energy Initiative, ADB is committed to achieving 3,000 MW of new solar power projects by \n2013, providing up to $2.25 billion in financing and leveraging an additional $6.75 billion. \n \n4.  Lessons from Previous Operations \n \n19.  In 2010, ADB approved financing for two solar power projects in Thailand; the Natural \nEnergy Development Solar Power Project13 and the Bangchak Solar Power Project (footnote 1). \nBoth projects will play important demonstration roles in Thailand\u2019s nascent solar power industry. \nThe  first  Bangchak  Solar  Power  Project  was  affected  by  floods  in  2011,  illustrating  the \nimportance of climate-proofing projects. The project\u2019s civil works will ensure that physical and \nhydrological  design  assumptions  take  into  account  the  changes  predicted  for  precipitation \npatterns and the severity and frequency of floods due to climate change. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n \nD.
