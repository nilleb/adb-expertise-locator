THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogrammatic  approach  for  the  Improving  Public  Expenditure  Quality  Program,  and  \n(ii) proposed policy-based loans to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for subprogram 1 of the \nImproving  Public  Expenditure  Quality  Program.  The  report  also  describes  the  proposed \ntechnical assistance (TA) for Support for Improving Public Expenditure Quality Program, and if \nthe Board approves the proposed loans, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the \nBoard, approve the TA.1 \n \n2.  The  program  supports  the  government\u2019s  commitment  to  improve  the  provision  of \ninfrastructure and service delivery to lift living standards and reduce poverty, and represents a \nmedium-  to  long-term  partnership  between  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  the \ngovernment. The government\u2019s priority areas to improve service delivery include (i) efficiently \nallocating public financial resources; (ii) strengthening the identification and management of \nfiscal risks; and (iii) improving the monitoring, evaluation, and oversight of budget expenditure. \nThe program is aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2016\u20132020 for Viet Nam2 and \nis included in the country operations business plan, 2017\u20132019 for Viet Nam.3 \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n3.  The development problem. Sustained high economic growth, averaging 6.5% during \n2005\u20132015, has supported one of the highest levels of public expenditure on infrastructure and \nservices in Southeast Asia. For example, Viet Nam spent an average of 11% of gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) per year on public infrastructure during 2010\u20132015 and plans to spend $20.2 \nbillion  on  infrastructure  in  2016,  a  50%  increase  in  real  terms  since  2014.  Similarly,  the \ncombined nominal recurrent expenditure on health and education grew 98% during 2011\u20132015, \nincreasing  its  share  of  the  total  state  budget  from  18%  to  24%.  Yet  higher  government \nexpenditure has not always been directly associated with improved outcomes. Despite nearly \nhalf of the state budget capital expenditure being allocated to infrastructure during 2011\u20132015, \nViet Nam ranked 85th out of 138 countries in the 2016 Global Competitiveness Index for the \nquality of its infrastructure, well behind its regional competitors (Figure 1). Similarly, results from \na Public Administration Performance Index survey revealed that in 2015, user satisfaction with \npublic hospitals had fallen to their lowest level since the survey began in 2011.4 \n \n4.  The disconnect between high levels of investment and the quality of infrastructure and \npublic services highlights the government\u2019s challenges in efficiently allocating and implementing \nscarce budgetary resources due to weaknesses in public expenditure and fiscal management \n(PEFM)  systems.5 For  instance,  Viet  Nam\u2019s  incremental  capital\u2013output  ratio,  a  common \nmeasure of investment efficiency, was 5.2 in 2014, meaning that $5.20 spent on investment \nproduces only $1 of income (Figure 2). The incremental capital-output ratio in neighboring \ncountries is 3\u20134. Viet Nam\u2019s inefficient investment erodes economic growth and undercuts \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2016.

With  Viet  Nam\u2019s  fiscal  space  declining  and  public  debt  levels \napproaching their legislated limit of 65% of GDP, enhancing PEFM will be vital for improving \ninfrastructure and service delivery and sustaining long-term poverty reduction. \n \n   \nFigure 1: Infrastructure Quality Ranking  Figure 2: Incremental Capital\u2013Output \n  Ratio, 2014 \n \n   \n   \nLegend: 1 = best, 140 = worst.

Geneva   Indicators 2016. Washington, DC. \n \n5.  Binding constraints. Sound PEFM can be defined as a system through which public \nfinancial resources are planned, directed, and controlled to enable the efficient (cost per unit of \noutput)  and  effective  (benefits  relative  to  costs)  delivery  of  public  service  goals.  Recent \ndiagnostics  highlight  four  binding  constraints  to  effective  PEFM  in  Viet  Nam.6 These  are  \n(i) inefficient public resource allocation, including a lack of longer-term expenditure planning and \nconsideration of costs associated with maintaining public assets; (ii) poor identification and \nmanagement of fiscal risks, which lead to unplanned fiscal costs and challenges in tracking and \nmitigating risks; (iii) weak oversight and evaluation of expenditure, which erode accountability \nfor results; and (iv) inadequate domestic resource mobilization, which limits funds available for \npublic expenditure (footnote 6). These constraints are discussed in in paras. 6\u20139.  \n \n6.  Inefficient public resource allocation. While the Ministry of Finance (MOF) continues \nto strengthen its PEFM system, weaknesses remain in budget planning and execution. First, \nthere is no medium-term expenditure framework so budgets are developed and approved to \ncover 1 year at a time. As a result, multiyear projects are often started without any assurance \nthat funds will be available to complete them. This hampers strategic investment planning and \nlimits advance project preparation. Second, there are more than 30 off-budget funds, each \nestablished under a different law and government decision. While off-budget expenditure is \napproved by the National Assembly, under the supervision of the MOF, there is no consolidated \nreporting  on  how  the  funds  are  used  and  expenditure  is  not  coordinated  with  national \ninvestment planning. In addition, limited information on government assets makes it difficult to \nmanage assets and allocate budget for maintenance expenditure, which undermines the quality \nof public infrastructure investment. While the government has introduced the concept of gender-\nresponsive budgeting into the national budget, the extent to which this is translated into better \nplanning and resource allocation has been limited. Gender analysis is rarely a part of policy \nanalysis, and there is a lack of sex-disaggregated data and evidence-based research to guide \n                                                \n6  Government of Viet Nam. 2013. Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) Assessment. Ha Noi. \n ", "3 \nplanning decisions. As a result, consideration of how public expenditure impacts gender has not \nbeen mainstreamed into the budget process.7 \n \n7.  Poor identification and management of fiscal risks. There are significant deviations \nbetween  approved  budgets  and  expenditure  outturns  arising  from  limitations  in  fiscal  risk \nmanagement.  Capital  expenditure  exceeded  budget  plans  by  an  average  of  29.2%  during \n2011\u20132015, while recurrent spending on health fell below budget targets by an average of \n13.3% during the same period. Further, limited controls over the use of government guarantees \nsignificantly erode budget reliability. Government guarantees accounted for over 18.0% of public \ndebt, or 11.4% of GDP, at the end of 2015. State policy banks are a major user of government \nguarantees, but a lack of information on these banks\u2019 financial status makes it difficult to assess \nhow this risk affects public debt management.8 Projects guaranteed by the government are risky, \nparticularly those issued to state enterprises with opaque balance sheets and untested debt \nservice  capacity.  Nevertheless,  guarantees  are  often  issued  without  any  charge  to  the \nborrowing entity. Finally, Viet Nam has progressively devolved fiscal responsibilities so that \nmore  than  half  of  the  state  budget  is  now  spent  by  subnational  governments.  Yet  most \nprovinces continue to rely on central government transfers and have limited accountability for \nrepaying  debt  mobilized  by  the  central  government  on  their  behalf,  including  official \ndevelopment assistance (ODA). Combined with unclear responsibilities over the provision of \ncounterpart funding, this limits incentives for well-disciplined and accountable fund utilization. \n \n8.  Weak  oversight  and  evaluation  of  expenditures.  The  government\u2019s  public \nexpenditure monitoring and evaluation systems require strengthening to lift spending quality. \nFormal appraisal mechanisms are often not independent, with responsible agencies subordinate \nto  authorities  who  are  the  ultimate  project  owners.  The  National  Assembly  is  often  given \ninsufficient time to thoroughly review budget proposals. Reporting standards for evaluating \npublic investment projects are not consistent, and information systems to monitor progress \nagainst targets are underdeveloped. Due to current resource limitations, the State Audit Office \nof Vietnam (SAV) can only audit 50%\u201360% of government reporting units. Moreover, audit \nresults  are  not  consistently  released  publicly,  particularly  for  enterprises  with  large  state \nholdings. Ongoing decentralization of project appraisal also presents challenges. Provincial \ngovernments, despite being in a better position to judge the success of a project, often lack the \nhuman capacity and systems to effectively undertake review and reporting functions. \n \n9.  Inadequate  domestic  resource  mobilization.  Weaknesses  in  mobilizing  domestic \nresources are creating pressures for fiscal consolidation. While Viet Nam\u2019s tax administration \nperforms well compared with its peers, there has been a significant downward trend in revenue \nas a share of GDP since 2010.9 Viet Nam has reduced its tax base with tax and tariff reductions, \nexemptions  for  favored  firms,  and  incentives  to  encourage  new  foreign  direct  investment. \nReversing the decline in the revenue-to-GDP ratio will be vital to stem a build-up in public debt \nand restore fiscal policy to a more sustainable path.10 To address this, significant new tax \nmeasures will be required. Administrative measures will also be needed to reduce tax evasion \nand arrears, disclose incidents of tax fraud, and streamline value-added tax refund procedures. \n                                                \n7  United  Nations  Entity  for  Gender  Equality  and  the  Empowerment  of Women  (UN  Women).  2015.

The government public financial management strategy. The government\u2019s Finance \nDevelopment  Strategy  (FDS),  2011\u20132020  and  its  rolling  3-year  medium-term  action  plan,  \n2015\u20132017 lay out a comprehensive reform plan to improve the impact of public expenditure on \npoverty reduction and sustainable growth.11 The FDS aims to reduce financial waste, enhance \nthe  accountability  and  transparency  of  budget  operations,  and  empower  subnational \ngovernments  to  provide  services  more  directly  to  the  public.  In  line  with  the  FDS,  the \ngovernment has approved PEFM reforms, including passing the Public Investment Law in 2014 \nand  the  State  Budget  Law  in  2015.  However,  the  government  now  faces  significant \nimplementation challenges because numerous decrees are needed to clarify how the principles \nof the laws will be implemented. Significant capacity development is required to ensure officials \ncan implement enhanced PEFM requirements. While reforms are focused on PEFM processes, \nthey are expected to catalyze incremental institutional reforms over the medium-term. To ensure \nreforms are sustainable, support for these planned institutional changes is needed.12 \n \n11.  ADB\u2019s experience. The program will build on ADB\u2019s long engagement in Viet Nam\u2019s \nPEFM reform through policy dialogue, loan programs, TA, and knowledge support (Figure 3).13 \nIn 2008, ADB began supporting civil service reform, developing a standardized system for job \nanalysis, job descriptions, and qualification standards in government agencies. Following this, \nADB supported the preparation of the government\u2019s Socio-Economic Development Plan, 2011\u2013\n2015 and followed this up with capacity building and TA activities aimed at (i) enhancing the \nefficiency of externally financed public investments, (ii) further improving civil service capacity \nand performance management, and (iii) strengthening monitoring and evaluation systems and \ntheir  links  to  national  strategies.  During  this  time,  ADB  also  supported  revisions  to  the \nProcurement Law, and related reforms that regulate investment through private sector models. \nSince 2014 ADB has stepped up its support for PEFM in Viet Nam, providing targeted support \nto the government for enhancing public asset management systems, strengthening public debt \nmanagement,  reducing  risks  associated  with  government  guarantees,  and  working  across \ncentral agencies and the National Assembly to strengthen oversight of budget implementation. \n \n12.  Lessons  and  program  synergies.  ADB\u2019s past engagement has demonstrated that \naddressing  Viet  Nam\u2019s  PEFM  weaknesses  will  require  a  sequential  long-term  approach. \nRequests for support have often been dealt with in an ad hoc manner, leading to a wide array of \nactivities with few synergies between them. The program will address this by developing a \nsequenced long-term plan for policy reform and institutional change addressing expenditure and \ninvestment quality. This approach will facilitate ADB\u2019s deep engagement in policy reforms and \ngenerate synergies for ADB operations, particularly infrastructure, with direct links to road, rail, \nand  metro  asset  management  systems  as  well  as  to  secondary  education  reform.  The \nprogram\u2019s support for enhanced public debt and ODA management and strengthened project \nevaluation will create synergies across ADB\u2019s portfolio. The program will also complement \noperations in state-owned enterprise reform and the financial sector. For instance, reforms to \nstrengthen subnational capital mobilization will allow more direct lending from commercial banks \nto provincial governments, contributing to financial sector deepening. Likewise, reforms will \nsupport ADB efforts to commercialize state-owned enterprises by tightening controls over the \nissuance of government guarantees to these entities, and strengthening their audit standards \n(footnote 2). \n                                                \n11 Decision No. 450/QD-TTg of 18 April 2012 of the Prime Minister approving the Financial Strategy until 2020, and \nDecision No. 224/QD-BTC of 30 January 2013 of the Ministry of Finance approving the Action Plan of the Financial \nSector to Implement the Finance Development Strategy until 2020.

ADB\u2019s  added  value  to  the  program  design  and  implementation. ADB provided \ntechnical support for the preparation of the government\u2019s first 5-year public debt and borrowing \nplan and supported the introduction of new procedures to more comprehensively register public \ndebts  and  liabilities  for  national  and  subnational  governments.  ADB  also  conducted  a  risk \nassessment of provincial government debt mobilization through commercial banks to guide the \nimplementation of the revised State Budget Law. TA was provided to support the development \nof a risk management system for government guarantees and to tighten their use. In addition, \nADB supported the development of life cycle management systems for rail and metro assets, \nand established improved public asset management information systems. Finally, ADB helped \ncomplete a National Assembly user guide for the State Budget Law, to enhance scrutiny of the \nstate budget, prepared a manual to govern the financial management of ODA projects, and \ntrained 250 government officials to support its implementation. \n \n14.  Development partner coordination. The program was developed in close collaboration \nwith other development partners and led to the establishment of a development partner PEFM \nworking group in 2015 to ensure support is provided in a coordinated manner.14 Understanding \nthe  urgent  need  to  reverse  the  decline  in  Viet  Nam\u2019s  revenue-to-GDP  ratio,  various \ndevelopment  partners  (European  Union,  International  Monetary  Fund,  Japan  International \nCooperation Agency, World Bank) have been supporting the government in taxation reform, \nwhich consequently will not form part of the program. ADB\u2019s added value through the program \nwill be maximized by its deep, long-term engagement on issues related to expenditure and \ninvestment quality, particularly those that have strong synergies with ADB operations (para. 12). \nADB will also actively foster new partnerships to leverage expertise, such as with the United \nNations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women) to assist in \noperationalizing a gender-responsive budgeting action plan for the transport sector.15 \n \n                                                \n14 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n15 This partnership will directly assist Viet Nam in achieving Sustainable Development Goal 5.c.1 \u201cProportion of \ncountries with systems to track and make public allocations for gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment.\u201d Inter-\nAgency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators. 2016.

A programmatic approach through \npolicy-based loans was chosen because it is most effective in: (i) enabling ADB to provide \nmedium-term support for the implementation of policies necessary to achieve FDS, 2011\u20132020 \ntargets; (ii) leveraging PEFM reforms to make nation-wide improvements to the quality of public \nexpenditure; and (iii) contributing to filling the gap in government\u2019s financing to meet funding \nneeds in education, health, social protection and infrastructure. Subprogram 1 will focus on \nnational legislative and regulatory upgrades in PEFM, while subprogram 2 will center on the \nimplementation of legislation introduced under subprogram 1. This approach uses policy-based \nlending and extensive policy dialogue to address the long-term horizon required for PEFM \nupgrades and to ensure reforms are properly sequenced. To further deepen reforms, a third \nsubprogram may be considered subject to the successful implementation of subprograms 1 and \n2. It is envisioned that subprogram 3 would deepen the program\u2019s impact by addressing fiscal \ndecentralization issues in more detail, building on the more disciplined provincial borrowing \nrules and tighter subnational expenditure controls introduced under subprograms 1 and 2. \n \n16.  Economic impact of the program. The program is expected to enhance the quality of \npublic expenditure. Potential economic gains will be achieved by (i) improving project quality \nthrough  stronger  monitoring  and  evaluation;  (ii)  implementing  more  proficient  investment \nplanning, budget management, and life cycle asset management; and (iii) strengthening control \nover and reducing government-guaranteed loans (para. 29). \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n17.  The impact will be the improved provision of infrastructure and service delivery to lift \nliving  standards  and  reduce  poverty.  The  outcome  will  be  enhanced  public  financial \nmanagement  systems.  The  program  is  structured  around  three  policy  outputs:  (i)  a  more \nproductive allocation of public resources, (ii) strengthened identification and management of \nfiscal  risks,  and  (iii)  improved  oversight  and  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  budget \nimplementation.16 Subprogram 1 has 14 policy actions, which the government completed during \nNovember 2014\u2013September 2016. Subprogram 2 contains 14 policy actions, of which 10 are \nprior expected actions (triggers). \n \nC.  Outputs \n18.  Output 1: Public financial resources more productively allocated. This output will \nstrengthen systems that guide the allocation and disbursement of public funds and improve the \nmanagement of assets created by this expenditure. Achievements included under subprogram 1 \ninclude  the  introduction  of  5-year  medium-term  expenditure  frameworks  and  \n5-year public investment plans that allow for more strategic and disciplined expenditure planning. \nBy requiring additional public revenues and expenditures to be recorded in annual budget \ndocumentation, wasteful off-budget spending will be reduced. Subprogram 1 also supported the \nintroduction  of  gender-responsive  and  performance-based  budgeting  as  principles  of  state \nbudget management. To ensure that investments are sustainable, subprogram 1 introduced \nmore  stringent  life  cycle  public  asset  management  focusing  on  establishing  transparent \ninformation systems for improved metro, rail, and road asset management. \n \n19.  Under subprogram 2, the government will roll out measures to provide detailed guidance \non  performance-based  budget  management.  The  government  will  complete  its  first  \n                                                \n16 Future  support  beyond  the  program  period  may  target  the  implementation  of  PEFM  reforms  in  provincial \ngovernments, subject to the successful implementation of national reforms and agreement of relevant authorities. \n ", "7 \n5-year expenditure plans and release them publicly. It will also realize direct budgetary savings \nby reducing off-budget expenditure and curtailing use of state budget contingency funds. User \nfees will be introduced to fund maintenance and operational costs of major infrastructure assets. \n \n20.  Output 2: Identification and management of fiscal risks strengthened. This output \nstrengthened  the  government\u2019s  management  of  fiscal  risks,  improved  transparency,  and \ntransferred responsibility for repaying liabilities to fund users. Achievements under subprogram \n1 include the government strengthening its control over the provision and management of \ngovernment guarantees, reducing the maximum guarantee from 100% of investment capital to \nbelow  80%.  The  government  is  now  holding  parent  companies  directly  responsible  for \nguaranteed debts in the event of subsidiary default.17 The government completed a detailed risk \nassessment of the implications of allowing provincial governments to mobilize capital from \ncommercial  banks  and  introduced  onlending  procedures  for  provinces  that  increased  their \nresponsibility for loan repayment based on their own-source revenue raising ability. In addition, \nthe government enhanced transparency and accountability by requiring state policy banks to \npublicly disclose the total capital mobilized by issuing government-guaranteed bonds and to \ndisclose their financial status at the time the bonds are issued. \n \n21.  Under subprogram 2, the government will prioritize adhering to sustainable public debt \nlimits and will ensure that the overall stock of government guarantees declines. To further \nincrease transparency, the government will prepare a consolidated annual public debt report \ndisclosing  all  types  of  central  government  debt,  including  government  guarantees.  Under \nsubprogram 2, the government will encourage discipline in the use of government guarantees \nby developing a methodology for calculating risk-based user fees to offset fiscal costs created \nby the guarantees. The government will ensure provincial governments comply with onlending \npolicies to increase their accountability for borrowing, and will issue guidelines to define ODA \nand concessional borrowing financial management mechanisms in more detail. \n \n22.  Output  3:  Oversight  and  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  budget  implementation \nimproved. This output strengthened systems for evaluating public investment and enhanced \nthe legal framework for preventing the misuse of public funds. Achievements under subprogram \n1  include  the  government  upgrading  the  State  Audit  Law  to  require  a  state  audit  of  all \nenterprises in which the state holds more than 50% of charter capital. This reform requires (i) a \nstate audit of agencies that mobilize and manage public debts, and (ii) the public disclosure of \naudit reports along with the government\u2019s annual report of consolidated audit results. The \ngovernment strengthened the supervision of public investment by mandating the preparation of, \nand  compulsory  funding  allocations  for,  annual  project  evaluation  reports.  It  established \nevaluation criteria to systematically assess the efficiency and effectiveness of public investment \nand  introduced  a  uniform  data  management  framework  for  results-based  monitoring.  The \ngovernment also strengthened budget oversight by the National Assembly. The reforms provide \nfor  a  review  of  5-year  financial  and  public  debt  repayment  plans  and  any  supplementary \nappropriations using over-realized revenues. To allow for a more comprehensive review of \nbudget  submissions,  the  government  increased  the  amount  of  time  that  budget  screening \ncommittees may take to review budget documentation from 45 days to 55 days. \n \n23.  Under subprogram 2, the government will upgrade information management systems to \nprovide results-based monitoring data for public investment nationally and provincially. It will \nfurther strengthen supervision and evaluation by introducing minimum quality standards to all \nproject  evaluation  reports.  To  increase  transparency,  the  government  will  publish  SAV\u2019s \n                                                \n17 In 2015, domestically guaranteed debt by the central government was equal to $9.2 billion, or 4.9% of GDP. \n ", "8 \nconsolidated audit results for 2015 and 2016, as well as all complete state audits for enterprises. \nIt will also publish monitoring and evaluation reports for at least 50% of capital expenditure on \nthe public investment information portal of the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI). \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n24.  To finance subprogram 1, the government has requested a loan of $200 million, with an \nequivalent amount programmed for subprogram 2. The loans for subprogram 1 will include one \nof $117.3 million equivalent financed from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (Asian Development \nFund) and another of $82.7 million financed from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources. The Asian \nDevelopment Fund loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years; an \ninterest rate of 2% per annum during the grace period and thereafter; and such other terms and \nconditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The ordinary capital resources loan will have a \n15-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  3  years;  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan  agreement.  Policy-based  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  following  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time to time). \n \n25.  In 2016, the government plans to borrow approximately $20.9 billion to cover a budget \ndeficit of 5% of GDP, with an estimated $4.9 billion to be mobilized from ODA to fill the financing \ngap. The size of the loan reflects the government\u2019s financing needs and the weight of the \nprogram as highlighted by the net economic benefits and the costs of implementation calculated \nin the program impact assessment.18  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n26.  MOF will be the executing agency. The MPI, the National Assembly Committee for \nFinancial  and  Budgetary  Affairs,  and  SAV  will  be  the  implementing  agencies.  A  steering \ncommittee, chaired by MOF and with implementing agencies as members, will oversee the \nprogram.  The  implementation  period  is  from  November  2014  to  September  2016  for \nsubprogram 1, and from October 2016 to July 2018 for subprogram 2. \n \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n27.  The government has requested TA to support the implementation of reforms under \nsubprogram 2. 19 The TA is estimated to cost $650,000, of which $575,000 equivalent will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). MOF and \nMPI will provide counterpart support in the form of office space, counterpart staff, and other \nfacilities. The scope of the TA parallels the three program outputs and provides (i) technical \nsupport to enhance infrastructure asset management, (ii) an analysis of risk-sharing mechanisms \nbetween the central and provincial governments, (iii) upgrades of public debt management toward \ninternational standards, (iv) support to implement the Public Investment Law (2014) and the \nDecree  on  Supervision  and  Evaluation  of  Public  Investment,  and  (v)  capacity  building  to \nimplement gender-responsive budgeting practices in targeted line agencies. \n \n28.  MOF will be the executing agency for the TA. MOF and MPI will be the implementing \nagencies. The TA will begin in January 2017 and will be implemented over 15 months ending \n                                                \n18 Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19 Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nMarch 2018. The TA will provide 8 person-months of international consulting services and  \n22 person-months of national consulting services. The consultants will work on an intermittent \nbasis and will be engaged following ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as \namended  from  time  to  time).  Disbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  made  following  ADB's \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial \n29.  A growing body of empirical research demonstrates the strong link between  quality \npublic financial management systems and economic growth and poverty reduction.20 A program \nimpact assessment was prepared to estimate the potential benefits and costs of subprogram 1 \nusing a cost\u2013benefit analysis framework. Once fully implemented, the net benefits are expected \nto approximate $1.04 billion per annum. The benefits will come from budget efficiencies and \nsavings generated through (i) better government planning and asset management, (ii) a transfer \nof extra-budgetary accounts into the consolidated budget, (iii) a reduction in the amount and risk \nfrom government guarantees, and (iv) efficiencies derived from enhanced project evaluation and \nmonitoring systems.  \n \nB.  Governance \n30.  A governance risk assessment was conducted21 and the government undertook and \npublished its first public expenditure financial accountability assessment in July 2013 (footnote \n6). While there have been improvements in the quality of budget operations, the government \ncontinues to face challenges in the transparency and accountability of public fund usage. To \naddress these challenges, the government is pursuing a progressive reform agenda. ADB has \nsupported these efforts since 2008 with initiatives to improve planning, strengthen PEFM, and \nincrease legal transparency and accessibility. These efforts are being further expanded and \ndeepened under the planned program (footnote 13). Consistent with commitments to good \ngovernance,  program  implementation  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Revised  Staff  Guidelines  for \nImplementing the Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan.22 \n \n31.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and the MOF. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n32.  The program will have positive impacts on poverty and social issues. The program will \nsupport higher economic growth from better quality infrastructure and services as a result of \nmore efficient state budget expenditure. At the same time, economic growth will become more \nsustainable by alleviating fiscal pressures and putting in place a more disciplined system of \npublic debt management. Under subprogram 1, the program will be classified some gender \nelements because of its support for introducing gender equity and performance measurement \nprinciples into state budget systems. This will allow for a more targeted allocation of public \nresources to the poor and other vulnerable groups such as women.  \n                                                \n20 Peterson. S. 2015.

Safeguards \n33.  The program does not trigger ADB\u2019s safeguard policies and is classified category C for \nthe environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n34.  Major risks and mitigating measures are described in detail in the risk assessment and \nrisk management plan (footnote 21). The expected net benefits and impacts of the program are \nexpected to outweigh the risks. At the macroeconomic level, medium risks include public debt \nconstraints which could disrupt investment plans and weak institutional coordination that limits \nthe ability of the authorities to fully implement reforms. Development partners are providing \ncoordinated policy dialogue and support to the government to improve public debt management \nand rebuild economic buffers. At the microeconomic level, medium risks include reforms that \nmay  make  it  more  challenging for  provincial  governments to raise  capital,  and  insufficient \nhuman capacity that might hamper the achievement of targeted reforms, particularly if vested \ninterests resist  new  accountability  and  transparency  measures.  ADB will  work  with  central \ngovernment ministries and the National Assembly to mitigate these risks. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n35.  The government and MOF have assured ADB that implementation of the program shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the loan document. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n36.  I am satisfied that the proposed programmatic approach and policy-based loans would \ncomply with the Articles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend \nthat the Board approve \n(i)  the  programmatic  approach  for  the  Improving  Public  Expenditure  Quality \nProgram; \n(ii)  the loan of $82,700,000 to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for subprogram 1 of \nthe Improving Public Expenditure Quality Program, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources,  with  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of 15 years, \nincluding a grace period of 3 years; and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement \npresented to the Board; and \n(iii)  the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR85,483,000  to  the  Socialist \nRepublic of Viet Nam for subprogram 1 of the Improving Public Expenditure \nQuality  Program,  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  (Asian  Development \nFund), with an interest charge at the rate of 2% per annum during the grace \nperiod and thereafter; for a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years; \nand such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with \nthose set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board. \n \n  Takehiko Nakao \nPresident \n21 November 2016 \n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nImpact the Program is Aligned with \nProvision of infrastructure and service delivery improved (Finance Development Strategy, 2011\u20132020)a \n  Performance Indicators with  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome  By 2018:     \nPublic financial  a.
