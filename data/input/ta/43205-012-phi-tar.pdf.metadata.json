INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of the Philippines, through the Bureau of Local Government Finance \n(BLGF), asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide capacity development technical \nassistance (TA) to support local government revenue generation and land administration and \nmanagement  reforms.  These  are  to  strengthen  social  and  economic  development, \nenvironmental management, and governance of local government units (LGUs). The TA is \nincluded in ADB\u201fs 2010\u20132012 country operations business plan for the Philippines.1 During the \n15\u201329 September fact-finding mission, the government and ADB reached an understanding on \nthe TA impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, \nand terms of reference. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Land titles are important assets that can be traded or used as collateral for loans, which \nin turn can be transformed into capital for economic activities. Land information management \nhas been neglected in the Philippines. As a result, about half of the estimated 24 million land \nparcels  remain  untitled,  of  which  7  million  to  8  million  are  estimated  to  be  residential.               \nThe country\u201fs record of land ownership weakens security of tenure, opens the system to abuse, \nand denies government and citizens a complete view of land ownership. This results in disputes, \nand inefficient social and economic services and environmental management. The lack of land \ntenure security ultimately inhibits the ability to invest and hampers the country\u201fs economic \ngrowth. Recent attempts to establish a unified system for property registration and public land \nmanagement have led to drafting of the Land Administration Reform Act, which is one of the 17 \npriority bills submitted to Congress in 2011. Oversight of the management of land information \nand  responsibility  for  land  classification,  surveys,  and  mapping  is  highly  fragmented.  The \nDepartment of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) is the primary agency involved in \nland titling issuing about 100,000 patents a year. Other key national government agencies \n(NGAs) involved include the Registry of Deeds of the Land Registration Authority (LRA) and the \nDepartment of Finance (DOF), in particular BLGF.3 \n \n3.  Lack of national standards and methods for valuation and limited training of valuation \nstaff have led to the use of conflicting valuation methodologies, distorted real property values, \npoliticized application of real property tax rates and assessments, limited access to public \nrecords, and limited use of information technology in appraisals. Outdated real property values \nbecause of irregular updating of schedules of market values (SMVs) by LGUs, combined with \npoor collection efficiency, have resulted in low revenue collections from the real property tax.      \nIn many LGUs, SMVs substantially lag true market values, often as much as 200%\u2013500%.        \nIn 2007, collection efficiency was only 27% in provinces and 68% in cities. Thus the ability of \nLGUs to raise revenue from real property taxes is severely hampered, and their corresponding \nexpenditure for constituency welfare is much constrained.  \n \n4.  TA funded by the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID) for the \nLand Administration and Management Project 2 (LAMP2), specifically the Innovation Support \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2009. Country Operations Business Plan: Philippines, 2010\u20132012. Manila. The TA is included under the title \nSupport to Policy Development on Decentralization and Local Governance. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u201fs website on 18 October 2010. \n3  DENR is responsible for titling, surveying, and sharing land information. The Registry of Deeds is responsible for \nregistration and sharing of title information; and BLGF coordinates matters relating to property tax, i.e., valuation. \n ", "2   \nFund (ISF),4 shows that a demand-driven reform program focusing on the reform of processes \nfor land administration and management (LAM) in policy, technical, and institutional areas can \ngain significant momentum within LGUs, even in a difficult policy environment. The TA worked \nsimultaneously on these three aspects with new processes and technology developed under the \nexisting legal framework, while changes to laws5 were pursued in parallel. Reforms were made \nto both the fiscal (property valuation and tax policy), and technical (surveying, mapping, land \ndisposition, and land registration) property systems.  \n \n5.  The current government states that tax administration reforms are a priority. LAMP2 \nprepared a land sector development plan for submission by DENR and DOF partners to the \nNational  Economic  and  Development  Authority  (NEDA)  for  inclusion  in  the  2011\u20132016            \nPhilippine Development Plan. In an August 2010 memorandum, the Department of Interior and \nLocal  Government  (DILG)  states  that  it  recognizes  the  successful  implementation  and \ninnovations  of  LAM  reforms,  and  supports  the  expansion  of  LGU-managed  LAM  reforms \nthrough LGU\u2013NGA partnerships. It sees these as consistent with the thrusts of this government. \nTherefore, the revenue generation and land administration reforms initiated by LAMP2 will likely \nbe included in the 2010\u20132016 plan. Particular emphasis will be placed on SMV-related reforms.  \n \n6.  The self-assessment activity completion report and independent completion report both \nrate LAMP2 \u201csuccessful.\u201d Despite this, AusAID has informed the government that it will \u201cpause\u201d \nits assistance while awaiting formulation of its new country strategy paper expected to be \nfinalized in 2011. The World Bank\u201fs major financial commitment to LAMP2 was for land titling \nand land services, but it increased its interest in the DOF valuation and taxation reforms as the \nproject progressed. At the same time, the World Bank implemented the Local Government \nFinance Development Project within DOF\u201fs Municipal Development Fund Office.  \n \n7.  Since 2004, ADB has supported the government's decentralization efforts through the \nLocal Government Finance and Budget Reform Program, which was designed as a program \ncluster with provision for program lending and TA.6 Various TA projects have helped continue \nthe policy dialogue, address gaps and constraints in the five core program areas, as well as \ndevelop capacity.7 Lessons from the program include (i) persist with long-term commitment; (ii) \nensure the government drives the program; (iii) engage intensively over time especially  to \ndevelop capacity (as broadly defined) at all levels; and (iv) support coordination efforts between \ncentral agencies and LGUs. ADB has been coordinating with the development partners through \nthe  Working  Group  for  Decentralization  and  Local  Government  under  the  Philippines \nDevelopment Forum.  \n                                                \n4  The ISF ran from February 2006 to June 2010 and initially reached 16 LGUs across the country. LGUs received \nsmall grants to be used for procurement of equipment, training, and operations. In parallel, the ISF helped with \naccess to national government data, updates, and training. \n5  Congress has passed two laws developed by LAMP2: the Real Estate Service Act (Republic Act No. 9646,           \n16 July 2009) and the Free Patent Law (Republic Act No. 0023, otherwise known as the Act Authorizing the \nIssuance of Free Patents to Residential Lands, 22 March 2010).  \n6  Subprogram 1 covered 2006\u20132007 and provided a comprehensive policy framework and matrix that, while helping \nfinalize  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework,  sought  to  broaden  policy  reforms  in  five  core  areas:  (i) \nintergovernmental fiscal relations; (ii) fiscal management, planning, and public expenditure management; (iii) LGU \nperformance  measurement  and  service  delivery;  (iv)  credit  financing;  and  (v)  local  own  source  revenues. \nSubprogram 2 covered 2008\u20132009 and continued the work in the five target areas, with intensification of effort and \nfinalization of a number of key actions commenced in subprogram 1. \n7  The most relevant for this TA is: ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance to the Republic of the Philippines for Local \nGovernance and Fiscal Management. Manila (TA 4778-PHI, for $1.8 million).  \n \n \n ", "  3 \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The TA will expand the delivery of economic and social services in participating LGUs. \nIts outcome will be participating LGUs use improved land management and administration \nsystems, including property valuation and taxation innovations, to generate increased local \ngovernment revenues.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  Drawing on careful deliberation based on the experiences of the ISF program, a pilot \napproach8 will be adopted comprising the following four components. \n \n10.  Institutionalization of LAM good practice models. At least two LGUs will be selected \nbased on their demonstrated capacity, leadership, and proven track record in specific systems \nor technologies. These LGUs will be provided with technical assistance and capability building \nto ensure their development as good practice models in the LAM training network. The LGUs \nwill link with the Center for LAM at the Land Management Bureau and serve as the center\u201fs \ntraining hubs. This component will also involve strengthening the LGUs\u201f front desks, information \noffices, and/or the LGU land services office to provide a business one-stop shop. Beyond \nsupport to the core revenue and land information functions, these LGUs will be supported in \nrevising their SMVs, and land management and investment plans to complete reform of local \nmajor land and finance-related systems. This will be achieved using a \u201cwhole of government\u201d \napproach. \n \n11.  Extension of LAM activities. The activities will focus on two of the five LGUs9 that have \nreceived ISF support since September 2009. To date, support has focused on the establishment \nof the spatial land system and/or geographic information system (GIS), or the electronic tax \nrevenue and collection system. Further support is required to ensure the full operation of these \nbasic unified land information and revenue systems and their adoption of reforms on valuation, \nland  management,  and  investment  planning.  Selection  will  be  based  on  assessment  of \nperformance, likelihood of success, and readiness to expand existing small grants. Parallel \nassistance will be provided to the LGU LAM agency partners. \n \n12.  Provision of small LAM grants to three new LGUs. This will entail the competitive \nselection of new LGUs through the Leagues of Provinces, Cities, and Municipalities, and the \ninteragency  grant  awards  committee.  Criteria  include  leadership, track  record  in  managing \ninteragency cooperation, project preparedness, and commitment of the LGU and its partners to \nLAM  reform.  LGUs  will  commit  to  set  up  the  appropriate  organization  structures  and \nmechanisms, and to provide at least a 25% counterpart fund to the grant. Coverage may be \nexpanded to include progressive and deserving fourth to fifth class LGUs.10  \n \n                                                \n8  Four groups of LGUs are to receive grants for a total of eight cities and municipalities and one province. The \ndemand-driven nature of the project means that the number of LGUs expected to take up each of the five possible \noutput types cannot be estimated at this stage. \n9  Dipolog, Iriga, Laoag, Oroquieta, and Tayabas. \n10 This refers to the government\u201fs classification system for LGUs as specified in the DoF Order No. 23-08 effective 29 \nJuly 2008. According to this, fourth class municipalities have an average annual income of P25 million\u2013P35 million \nwhile fifth class municipalities have an average annual income of P15 million\u2013P25 million during the last 3 calendar \nyears. Fourth class cities have an average annual income of P160 million\u2013P240 million while fifth class cities have \nan average annual income of P80 million\u2013P160 million during the past 3 years.  \n ", "4   \n13.  Provision of support to one provincial and one municipal LGU. The objective is to \nstrengthen the role of the province in rolling out LAM initiatives. A provincial LGU will be \nselected where an ISF-supported LGU is located that has demonstrated capacity for replication \nof LAM technologies, and good leadership and a track record in interagency cooperation and \ncollaboration. This provincial LGU will have committed to partnerships between the LGUs and \ntheir LAM agency partners. A counterpart fund of at least 25% is required. A municipality within \nthe province will also be assisted to serve as a pilot for a provincial ISF LGU model. \n \n14.  Through the pilots, the TA will achieve five outputs. \n \n15.  Output 1. Participating LGUs and partner national LAM agencies collaborate actively, \neffectively, and efficiently in the delivery of improved LAM services to the public. This entails the \nselection of LGUs, the setting up of an interagency LAM steering committee to provide policy \nand  program  directions  and  implementation  oversight  (to  ensure  complementation  across \nagencies  and  information  sharing),  human  resources  development  and  management,  LAM \npolicy development and advocacy, advocacy on governance of LAM revenues and expenditures, \nand the establishment of a LAM services office (one-stop shop) to improve delivery of services \nto the various stakeholders.   \n \n16.  Output  2.  Unified  land  information  systems  are  established  and  operating  in \nparticipating LGUs and partner LAM agencies. This includes the development of a unified land \ninformation system; TA and capability building; the provision of systems and facilities enabling \naccess by the stakeholders to cross-referenced, accurate, and up-to-date parcel-based land \nand related information; the installation of a valuation database and information system; and the \nrevision of the SMVs and revenue information system.  \n \n17.  Output 3. Property valuation policies and practices are updated in participating mature \nLGUs. This includes TA, technology transfer and adoption of valuation systems developed by \nBLGF, revision of the SMVs, and use of a state-of-the-art GIS for a parcel-based revenue \ninformation system. This is expected to broaden the local revenue and tax base, and establish a \nmore efficient and transparent revenue collection system. \n \n18.  Output 4. Zoning plans and comprehensive land use plans are revised (only for mature \nparticipating  LGUs)  with  stakeholder  participation.  This  will  link  components  (systems  and \ndatabase development to generate spatial information and local revenue) to land management \nand investment planning to be collectively used to improve social and economic development \nand environmental management. TA and training will be provided for the management and \nutilization of revenues generated for social and economic development.   \n \n19.  Output 5. Land tenure status of participating LGUs is assessed and appropriate land \ntenure improvement, and financing strategies and plans are prepared. This may entail surveying \nand  tax  mapping  in  rural  and  urban  areas  designed  to  improve  tenure  security  thereby \nexpanding real property tax and business tax collection.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n20.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,600,000.00 equivalent, $1,500,000.00 of \nwhich  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction,  and \nadministered by ADB. LGUs involved in the pilot projects, will finance $85,000.00 equivalent as \ncounterpart funds (in kind) while the national government will contribute $15,000.00. The cost \nestimates and financing plan is provided in Appendix 2.  \n ", "  5 \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n21.  As the executing agency, BLGF will oversee the TA project and provide leadership, as \nwell  as  policy  and  program  direction  to  ensure  efficient  implementation.  BLGF  will  be \nresponsible for the adoption of appropriate arrangements to operationalize the project including \nthe establishment of an interagency governing board and coordination with the ADB project \nofficer, the consulting team, and the project LGUs. An interagency governing board chaired \nalternately by DENR, DILG, and DOF, and comprising officials from BLGF; DENR; DILG; LRA; \nNEDA; the leagues of provinces, cities, and municipalities; nongovernment organizations; and \nthe private sector will be established.11 The implementing agencies will include BLGF, DENR, \nand LRA\u201fs Registry of Deeds.12 Arrangements for LGU grantees are provided in Appendix 4.  \n22.  Based on track record, a consultant firm13 will be responsible for overall management of \nimplementation  to  ensure  compliance  with  all  policy  actions,  program  administration, \ndisbursements, and maintenance of all project records. ADB will engage the consultant using \nthe single-source selection method in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2010, as amended from time to time). The outline terms of reference for 4 person-months of \ninternational consulting and 162 person-months of national consulting are in Appendix 3. The \nconsultant will design, procure, and install the pilot facilities under the TA in accordance with \nADB\u201fs Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). Disbursements under the \nTA  will  be  done  in  accordance  with  ADB\u201fs  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook          \n(2010, as amended from time to time).14  \n \n23.  The TA will be implemented from July 2011 to June 2013. The expected outputs and \noutcome evaluation, and key experiences gained and methodologies developed under the TA \nwill be disseminated through websites, an LGU forum, and the Center for LAM at the Land \nManagement Bureau at DENR. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n24.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $1,500,000.00  to  the \nGovernment of the Republic of the Philippines to be financed on a grant basis by the Japan \nFund for Poverty Reduction for Support to Local Government Revenue Generation and Land \nAdministration Reforms, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n11  This board will be responsible for the selection of beneficiary LGUs and for coordinating implementation across \nstakeholder agencies. It will meet at least twice a year to monitor progress and oversee implementation. ADB will \nparticipate in the meetings as an observer. Depending on the agreements, other development partners such as \nAusAID and the Japan International Cooperation Agency may be invited as observers. Participating LGUs, through \ntheir local steering committees, will be responsible for program implementation and report progress to the \nconsultant firm.  \n12  Each implementing agency will be responsible for coordinating implementation of project operations relating to its \nspecific functions. DENR will be responsible for titling, surveying, and sharing land information. LRA\u201fs Registry of \nDeeds will be responsible for registration and sharing of title information, and BLGF will coordinate on matters \nrelating to property tax, i.e., valuation. \n13  Land Equity International, a consultant firm previously engaged by AusAID on a competitive basis (LAMP2 was \ncontracted after public tendering in 2005) and with a track record in implementing LAMP2 will be engaged under \nthe TA using single source selection. BLGF has given the consultant firm a positive assessment. \n14 Upon TA completion, the consultant will turn over equipment to the LGUs. The consultant will submit a certificate of \nturnover or disposal to ADB in line with ADB procedures.  \n ", "6    Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n \nDesign  Performance Targets and  Data Sources and   \nSummary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms   Assumptions and Risks \nImpact       \nExpanded delivery of  Half of the increased LGU  LGU budget  Assumption \neconomic and social  revenues from additional    Increased local revenues \nservices in participating  property tax generation  Local government  will translate into improved \nLGUs  translate into increased LGU  performance monitoring  service delivery in \nspending for social and  system   participating LGUs \neconomic development in the   \nparticipating LGU beginning   Risks \n5 years after the start of the  Weak plan and budget \nproject or earlier   management \nLow efficiency of \ngovernment service \ndelivery \nOutcome       \nParticipating LGUs  use  Real property tax collection  Real property tax  Assumptions \nimproved land  and business revenue  collection data  Functional partnerships \nmanagement and  collection increase by at least    established between \nadministration systems,  5% in participating LGUs   Business revenue  participating LGUs and \nincluding property  by the end of the project   collection data  LAM agency partners by \nvaluation and taxation  2012 \ninnovations, to generate  LGUs commit to the \nincreased local  principles of participation, \ngovernment revenues  equality, transparency, \nand accountability \n \nRisk \nInterference of politically \ninfluential taxpayers result \nin under collection of \nproperty taxes and \nbusiness revenue \ncollection despite \nimproved capacity and \ncapability \nOutputs       \n1.
