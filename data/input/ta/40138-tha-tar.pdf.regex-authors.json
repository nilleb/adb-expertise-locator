The Government of Thailand (the Government) has requested technical assistance (TA) \nfrom the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to support implementation of plans for expanding and \nintegrating the rail mass rapid transit (MRT) system in central Bangkok. A TA grant in the \namount of $450,000 has been included in ADB\u2019s 2006 TA program for Thailand, and the draft \ncountry partnership strategy identifies infrastructure development as a core area of cooperation \nbetween the Government and ADB. The TA aims to build on the analytical framework and \nconceptual approaches outlined under a previous ADB TA, which addressed key institutional, \nfinancial, and regulatory issues associated with large-scale investments in rail MRT systems.1 A \nfact-finding mission from 10 to 14 November 2006 consulted with the Government and other key \nstakeholders on the desired focus and expected results of the TA. This report reflects the \nfindings of the mission and the understandings reached with the Government on the objectives, \nscope,  outputs,  cost,  and  implementation  arrangements  for  the  TA.2 The  TA  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Rising levels of car ownership, lack of investment in public transit, and the absence of a \ncomprehensive traffic management system have all contributed to increased traffic congestion \nin central Bangkok. The resulting high logistics costs of conducting business in Bangkok curtail \nthe city\u2019s productivity and competitiveness, and pose a serious constraint to future economic \ngrowth. Given that the greater metropolitan area accounts for more than 45% of Thailand\u2019s \ngross  domestic  product,  reducing  traffic  congestion  in  Bangkok  has  become  a  national \neconomic priority. The environmental and health implications of increased car traffic and the \nassociated  need  to  reduce  fuel  consumption  and  imports  further  point  to  the  urgency  of \nencouraging greater use of public transit. \n \n3.  Expanding the Bangkok rail MRT system is an integral component of the Government\u2019s \nefforts to promote sustainable urban transit. The existing rail MRT system consists of two \nseparate lines that are operated by different private concessionaires. The 24 kilometer (km) \nelevated  skytrain  has  been  in  operation  since  1999  and  the  20  km  subway  commenced \noperations in 2004. The Government\u2019s master plan for the rail MRT system includes both \nunderground and elevated schemes totaling nearly 300 km at a cost exceeding $14 billion. In \naddition  to  the  massive  investment  requirements,  the  core  challenges  associated  with \nexpansion include: (i) developing a strategic plan for implementation that reflects a phased \napproach  to  investing  in  priority  lines;  (ii)  integrating  operations,  fare  levels,  and  ticketing \nsystems  of  the  skytrain  with  the  subway,  and  with  new  lines;  (iii)  structuring  concession \nagreements  that  attract  private  sector  participation  in  operations;  and  (iv)  creating  the \ninstitutional framework to regulate different rail operators and additional modes of public transit.  \n \n4.  To assist the Government in addressing many of these complex issues concerning \nexpansion of the rail MRT system, ADB provided TA (phase I) to the Public Debt Management \nOffice (PDMO) in the Ministry of Finance, and the Office of Transport and Traffic Policy and \nPlanning (OTP) in the Ministry of Transport (footnote 1). The phase I TA (i) proposed different \ninstitutional frameworks for a more integrated approach to the regulation of transit systems in \n                                                \n1 ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Thailand for Infrastructure  Investment Advisory Assistance to \nthe Public Debt Management Office in Thailand \u2013 Major Change in Scope, Increase in Technical Assistance \nBudget, and Extension of Completion Date. Manila (TA 4676-THA, approved on 31 October, for $281,000). \n2 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 10 November 2006. \n ", "2   \nthe Bangkok metropolitan area, (ii) identified key fare setting and revenue sharing implications \nof integrating the two existing MRT rail lines under a single ticketing system, (iii) examined the \nbenefits of a gross-cost concession approach for contracting responsibilities for operation and \nmaintenance (O&M) of rail MRT lines to the private sector, and (iv) developed an interactive \nfinancial model to assess the impact of different fare structures and ridership levels on the \noperating revenues for different proposed line extensions. \n \n5.  The  Government\u2019s  strategic  approach  for  expanding  the  rail  MRT  system  has \nsubsequently been refined from the original master plan of June 2005. The revised plans \nincorporate a number of the findings and recommendations of the phase I TA, including the \nfollowing: (i) the prioritization and phasing of investments should be based on the financial \nviability of proposed lines, (ii) greater consideration should be given to gross-cost rather than \nnet-cost concessions for O&M, and (iii) a single automated ticketing system should be pursued \nto facilitate network integration and increase ridership. As a result, the Government has reduced \nthe number of new lines to five, down from 10 in the original master plan. The construction of \nthree lines totaling 118 km and costing approximately $4.5 billion will be open for bidding in \nearly 2007. Adoption of a single automated ticketing system to integrate existing skytrain and \nsubway operations, as well as new lines and possibly other transit modes (e.g., buses and \nferries), will be pursued. Concession contracts will be applied to encourage private O&M of the \nnew lines, and possibly investment in the rolling stock and signaling systems.  \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The TA is designed to provide analytical and advisory support to PDMO and OTP in \napplying specific techniques and procedures to structure private concessions for the O&M of \nnew rail lines, and to integrate the rail MRT network through the introduction of a single ticketing \nsystem.  These  activities  contribute  to  the  longer-term  objectives  of  improved  integration, \noperational efficiency, financial viability, and patronage of an expanded rail MRT system in \nBangkok. The TA outcomes are twofold: (i) specifications and procedures for tendering and \nstructuring O&M concessions on individual rail lines to the private sector; and (ii) an action plan \nfor the tendering, financing, implementation, and O&M of an integrated ticketing system for the \nrail MRT system.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n7.  The TA will consist of four components, each of which encompasses analytical and \nadvisory activities linked to specific outputs that contribute to the achievement of the desired \noutcomes. As indicated above, the TA outcomes are aligned toward attaining the Government\u2019s \nlonger-term objectives of infrastructure investments in the rail MRT sector. \n \n8.  Preparing Concession Contracts for Private Sector O&M of New Rail MRT Lines. \nDrawing on the analysis of different concession models under the phase I TA, this component \nwill support the Government\u2019s plans to award O&M concessions for the new rail MRT lines to \nthe private sector. For selected lines earmarked for construction, the TA will develop a financial \nmodel that indicates the relationship between projected ridership levels based on alternative \nfares, ticket product types, and fare implementation methods (e.g., distance, zonal, etc.). The \nanalyses will also take into consideration the integration of individual lines into the existing and \nplanned rail MRT network. This model will simulate gross operating revenues under different \n ", "  3\nfare and ridership scenarios. These calculations will be combined with operating cost estimates \n(along with potential capital and start-up costs to be assumed by the operator) to define an \nappropriate service fee and payment structure for an operating concession contract.  \n \n9.  To evaluate the applicability of net-cost or gross-cost concession arrangements for O&M, \nthe financial analysis will be combined with different assumptions of whether the public sector or \nthe private operator would invest in the rolling stock and other equipment. The TA will develop a \nstrategic  approach  for  structuring  and  restructuring concession  contracts that  accounts  for \nexpansion  of  the  rail  MRT  system,  achieves  value  for  money  for  the  Government,  and \nmaximizes the net social benefits of an integrated transit network. Specifications for net-cost \nand gross-cost concession contracts will be prepared that define the terms and conditions for \nO&M,  including  performance-based  criteria,  maintenance  responsibilities,  and  causes  for \ncontract termination. The TA will map out a tendering strategy that complies with the procedural \nrequirements of the Act on Private Participation in State Undertakings, 1992. To facilitate the \nbidding process, the TA will prepare model tender documents with the technical specifications \nfor proposals, the criteria for their evaluation, and an indicative schedule for the tendering \nprocess. The schedule will indicate the time frame required to comply with the 1992 Act to \nensure that an O&M concessionaire is selected prior to the completion of civil works. \n \n10.  Assessing the Functional, Technological, and Operational Requirements of an \nIntegrated Ticketing System. The desired functional capabilities of integrated transit ticketing \nsystems have a direct bearing on their technical and operational characteristics. The ticketing \nplatform under consideration for Bangkok is an automated fare collection system that integrates \nmultiple  rail  MRT  operators,  and  potentially  additional  transit  modes  (e.g.,  bus  and ferry), \nthrough a single payment media. Given recent advances in smart card technology, there is also \ninterest in expanding ticket capabilities to include e-commerce applications. The TA will conduct \na detailed assessment of the functional requirements of an integrated ticketing system for \nBangkok  that  takes  into  account  key  factors  such  as  fare  policies,  revenue  sharing \narrangements, plans to encompass new operators and different transit modes, the need to \nimprove physical connections between rail stations (as well as bus depots and ferry landings), \nand potential e-commerce linkages.  \n \n11.  A well-defined fare policy is a necessary precondition for the adoption of an integrated \nticketing  system.  To  enable  the  Government  to  make  informed  decisions,  advice  will  be \nprovided on how alternative fare policies could impact existing and future rail MRT operators, \nthe operators of other transit modes, and the Government\u2019s budget. Efficient, transparent, and \nsecure ticketing operations require an automated clearinghouse system for credit and debit \nprocessing, reconciling revenues among transit operators (as well as participating financial \ninstitutions and retail establishments), processing settlements, and generating financial reports. \nThe TA will outline specifications for an open architecture platform to allow the system to \naccommodate additional operators, transit modes, and new applications over time. It will also \ndetail further operational aspects of an integrated ticketing system such as card production and \ndistribution, customer services, and equipment maintenance.   \n \n12.  Evaluating  Procurement  Options  for  an  Integrated  Ticketing  System.  The \nGovernment has expressed an interest in implementing a new integrated ticketing system as a \npublic-private partnership (PPP). The TA will analyze the merits of such an approach compared \nwith traditional procurement, taking into account (i) the need to secure the participation of all rail \nMRT operators (with eventual expansion to operators of other transit modes); (ii) the desired \nfunctional characteristics of the system (including potential e-commerce applications); (iii) the \npotential institutional responsibilities for O&M (as  well  as the associated risk management \n ", "4   \nrequirements); (iv) experiences and lessons from other integrated urban MRT systems; and \n(v) the option that maximizes the Government\u2019s value for money based on life-cycle costing. \nGiven the potential for the system to include e-commerce applications, the TA will also explore \nthe prospect for equity financing from private sources and how this could influence the approach \nto procurement. \n \n13.  The  assessment  of  procurement  options  will  take  into  account the two  interrelated \nelements  of  integrated  ticketing  systems:  (i)  the  ticketing  equipment,  centralized  computer \nsystems, and associated infrastructure; and (ii) services to operate and maintain the system. \nBecause of the cost, complexity, and risk of managing these new, state-of-the-art systems, \ntransit  authorities  are  increasingly  outsourcing  their  system  support  and  operational \nrequirements.  Given  these  considerations,  the  TA  will  evaluate  the  advantages  and \ndisadvantages  of  a  design-build-operate-maintain  (DBOM)  approach  to  procurement  as \ncompared with a design-build (DB) option. Analysis of the DB option will also assess different \npossible  institutional  arrangements  for  system  O&M,  including  account  management,  cash \ncollection, customer relations, marketing support, technical help, etc. The TA will recommend an \ninstitutional design and structure for the management of an integrated ticketing contract.  \n \n14.  Preparing an Action Plan for Tendering and Implementing an Integrated Ticketing \nSystem. Based on the analysis of system requirements and institutional arrangements for O&M, \nthe TA will prepare the technical components of tender documents for an integrated ticketing \nsystem that encompasses existing and future rail MRT operators. In an effort to ensure system \ncompatibility with current and planned rail MRT lines, the TA will also coordinate with existing \noperators to define its technical specifications. This analysis will explicitly consider the interface \nof integrated ticketing with existing and future concession arrangements (i.e., net-cost and \ngross-cost)  and  fare  sharing  provisions.  Considering  the  desirability  of  outsourcing  the \nresponsibilities  (and  risks)  for  system  O&M,  the  tender  documents  will  reflect  the  most \nappropriate approach to procurement (i.e., DBOM, DB, or some variation thereof). In outlining \nbidding procedures and proposal evaluation criteria, the TA will draw on best practices and \nlessons from other cities, and prepare indicative estimates of the capital and O&M costs of a \nnew system. \n \n15.  To assist the Government in determining the necessary procedural steps, institutional \nresponsibilities, legal requirements, and requisite time frame for moving forward, the TA will \nprepare a comprehensive action plan for the tendering process and eventual implementation of \nan integrated ticketing system. The action plan will also outline proactive measures for the \nGovernment to define a fare policy that ensures the full participation of rail MRT operators, \nencompasses and integrates other transit modes and operators, and minimizes the need for \nbudgetary support. Input will be solicited from the Bank of Thailand to determine the licensing, \nfinancial,  reporting,  and  security  requirements  that  would  apply  to  the  fare  collection  and \nclearinghouse system operator. The action plan will also be underpinned by recommendations \nfor a phased approach to integrated ticketing, starting with the rail MRT system, progressing to \nother transit modes, and possibly including e-commerce applications.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $645,000 equivalent, of which $450,000 will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government will finance the \nremaining $195,000 equivalent by providing counterpart staff and other support facilities. The \ncost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \n ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The Ministry of Finance will be the Executing Agency (EA) for the TA, with PDMO and \nOTP  serving  as  implementing  agencies  (IAs).  PDMO\u2019s  principal  area  of  responsibility  will \ninclude  financial  policy  issues  whereas  OTP  will  oversee  matters  pertaining  to  transport \nplanning and operations. Similar to the implementation arrangements under the phase I TA, a \nworking group jointly chaired by the deputy directors general of PDMO and OTP will provide \ncomments,  suggestions,  and  guidance  at  different  stages  of  TA  implementation.  Tripartite \nreviews will involve the working group, consultants, and ADB. Inception, interim, draft final, and \nfinal reports will be submitted to ADB, PDMO and OTP directors general, and heads of other \nrelevant offices and agencies for guidance and necessary action. PDMO and OTP will each \nappoint a project director to assist with daily implementation of the TA, as well as counterpart \nstaff and other support services required by the consultants. \n \n18.  The TA will require a total of 12 person-months of international consultant inputs over a \nperiod of 9 months, starting in February 2007 and finishing in October 2007. Consulting services \nwill be provided by a team of five individual international consultants: (i) an urban transport \nplanner/team  leader  (3.0  person-months),  (ii)  a  transport  economist/policy  specialist \n(2.5 person-months), (iii) a financial specialist on PPPs (2.5 person-months), (iv)  a legal expert \non  concession  agreements  (2.0  person-months),  and  (v)  a  transit  ticketing  specialist \n(2.0 person-months). Because of the highly specialized skills and experience required of each \nconsultant, the number of qualified experts is limited. To ensure that experts are of high caliber \nand meet the Government\u2019s expectations, consultants will be recruited on an individual basis \nrather than through a firm. The consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with its \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2006, as amended from time to time). Outline terms of \nreference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n19.  The consultants will prepare an inception report within 2 weeks of mobilization, which will \ninclude a detailed work plan and schedule of deliverables agreed upon with ADB and the IAs. \nInterim reports will be submitted within the deadlines specified in the work plan. The draft final \nreport will incorporate feedback from the EA, IAs, other relevant offices and agencies, and ADB. \nThe team leader is responsible for submitting all required reports on behalf of the team. To \nfacilitate the dissemination of TA findings and to solicit input from other stakeholders, including \nADB\u2019s development partners, a series of forums will be conducted at selected intervals over the \nimplementation  period.  Two  workshops,  one  on  operating  concessions  and  another  on \nintegrated ticketing systems, will be conducted for the purpose of drawing on international \nexperience  and  expertise.  To  further  facilitate  dissemination  of  the  TA  findings  and \nrecommendations, the final report will be provided in both hard copy and electronic format. An \nindicative outline for the final report is in Appendix 4. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $450,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Thailand for Infrastructure Investment Advisory Assistance (Phase II), and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \nImproved integration,  O&M responsibilities for  Official statistics and  \u2022  Investment program to \noperational efficiency,  individual lines are  reports from relevant  expand the rail MRT \nfinancial viability, and  awarded to private  transit authorities and  system moves forward \npatronage of an  operators through  regulatory agencies  \u2022  Political will and \nexpanded rail MRT  viable concessions    commitment to pursue \nsystem in Bangkok    Annual reports and data  reforms and \nGreater physical and  from operators of  recommendations under \noperational integration  individual rail lines and the  the TA \nthrough a functioning  integrated ticketing system \nRisks \nsingle ticketing system   \n\u2022  Resistance to reforms \n  TA consultants\u2019 reports \nand implementation \nIncreased ridership  and ADB review missions \nmeasures from vested \nlevels on existing and   \ninterests \nnew rail MRT lines   \n\u2022  Insufficient institutional \ncapacity to structure and \ntender viable \nconcessions \nOutcomes      Assumptions \n1.
