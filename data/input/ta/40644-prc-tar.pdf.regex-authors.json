During country programming for the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) in November\u2013\nDecember 2006, the technical assistance (TA) Shanxi Development Strategy for Technical and \nVocational Education and Training was included in the 2007 nonlending program at the request \nof the Government. 1 In May 2007, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) fielded the Fact-Finding \nMission for the TA. The Shanxi provincial government emphasized the importance of technical \nand vocational education and training (TVET) and developing the skills of its workers as a key \ncomponent  of  its  strategy  for  adjusting  the  province\u2019s  economic  and  industrial  structures, \ntransforming its economic development pattern, ensuring its sustainability in terms of resources, \nenergy, and environment. Accordingly, the Mission and the Government agreed that the TA \nshould develop a strategy for TVET, which will be based on and serve the broader strategy for \nsocial  and  economic  development  of  the  province  in  the  next  5\u201310  years  and  beyond. \nUnderstanding was reached between the Mission and the Government on the impact, outcome, \noutput, costs and financing, implementation arrangements, and outline terms of reference for \nconsulting services of the TA. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The provincial government of Shanxi unveiled its 11th Five-Year Program (FYP) in 2006 \nwith the overall objective to improve the quality of people\u2019s life and build a harmonious society. \nCentral to reaching this objective are the acceleration of industrialization and building of a new \nsocialist countryside through continued economic and industrial restructuring, and coordinated \nrural and urban development.   \n \n3.  The restructuring aims at transforming Shanxi\u2019s economy into PRC\u2019s new energy and \nindustrial base. Specifically, it will (i) modernize the traditional priority industries of coal mining, \ncoke, electricity, and metallurgy; (ii) develop high value-added and high-technology industries of \nprocessing, materials, and equipment manufacturing; and (iii) strengthen the development of \ntourism and other service industries. Restructuring will contribute significantly to diversifying \nShanxi\u2019s industrial structure and fundamentally transforming its economic growth pattern into \none based on environment-friendly and sustainable development. Shanxi\u2019s per capita gross \ndomestic product (GDP) remains lower than the national average, and 52 of the province\u2019s 119 \ncounties are classified as poor, including 35 ranked as national poor counties. A key policy of \nthe 11th FYP is raising the livelihood of the rural population, facilitating coordinated urbanization, \nand transferring surplus rural labor to nonagricultural sectors.  \n \n4.  New  and  Emerging  Skill  Needs.  The  ongoing  economic  structural  change  and \ndevelopment of new industries will generate increasing demands for new skills and skilled \nworkers. There is an urgent need to assess this future demand in terms of different skills, their \nsectoral distribution, and their potential magnitudes. In particular, demand for skills that stem \nfrom  implementing  the  11th  FYP  should  be  assessed,  including  (i)  modernizing  the  four \ntraditional industries of coal mining, coke, electricity, and metallurgy; and (ii) developing new \nindustries of coal chemical industry, industrial equipment manufacturing, industrial materials, \nand tourism. Over 80% of TVET students come from rural areas, and rural areas are expected \nto continue to be the main source of students and job seekers in the future. It is important to \nassess how to further enhance TVET\u2019s role in facilitating coordinated rural to urban migration, \nincluding  providing  training  to  migrant  workers.  At  the  same  time,  TVET  schools  in  the \ncounty/city centers not only serve educational purposes, but are also part of the larger social, \ncultural,  and  economic  fabric  of  the  county/city.  TVET\u2019s  role  in  building  the  new  socialist \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 21 April 2007. \n ", "2   \ncountryside  also  requires  review.  A  comprehensive  understanding  of  these  factors  is \nfundamental to developing a TVET strategy.  \n \n5.  TVET in Shanxi province has seen significant improvement in recent years. However, \nthere  is  still  much  to  be  desired  for  the  existing  TVET  system  to  meet  market  demand, \nespecially in anticipation of rapid changes in demand for skills stemming from the economic \ntransformation in the coming decade. The TVET system will need to produce both more and \nbetter graduates, and strengthen its efficiency with continuing reform. TVET development is \nuneven, with almost all quality TVET institutions located in cities and urban centers. A number \nof underlying factors contribute to TVET\u2019s weak impact and uneven development. They are \ndiscussed below. \n \n6.  Weak Labor Market Links. Ensuring that graduates have the skills needed by the labor \nmarket is  key to the success of any TVET system, and responsiveness  to the labor market \nincluding the flexibility to adjust quickly to changes in market demand is particularly important to \nShanxi, given the anticipated significant changes in skills requirements in the coming years. \nMany  schools  continue  to  focus  on  academic  achievements  of  their  students,  rather  than \nimparting skills and practical experience. Labor market information flow is segmented, and \nexisting networks need to be integrated for more effective use. As elsewhere in the PRC, there \nare  examples  of  good  practices  in  Shanxi,  including  \u201chalf-time  study,  half-time  work\u201d  and \n\u201ctraining by order\u201d, which enable close cooperation between schools and enterprises. However, \nit is unclear whether these arrangements are viable only in specific industries or are due to \nspecific school/firm relationships. It is important to (i) assess key constraints on labor market \nlinkages; (ii) evaluate existing good practices to identify successful methods and mechanisms; \n(iii) review and consider approaches and practices of other countries; and (iv) review the role of \nprivate sector participation in TVET, and means and mechanisms to strengthen public private \npartnerships. Drawing on best practices in the PRC and abroad can yield valuable lessons to \nenhance the overall quality and relevance of TVET. \n \n7.  Insufficient Capacity and Teaching and Learning Conditions. According to recent \nstatistics, the average area of a TVET school in Shanxi is 9,450 square meters (m2), which is far \nless than the national standard of 15,000 m2; and laboratory and practice equipment per TVET \nschool averages less than half of the national average in terms of value. These conditions are \nsignificantly worse in TVET schools in rural areas and remote regions. Overcrowding and lack of \nequipment have affected the quality of learning and teaching, and are among the top constraints \non schools to increase enrollment. \n \n8.  The quality of teachers is a key determinant of the overall quality of TVET. Unlike their \ncounterparts  in  general  educational  institutions,  teachers  in  TVET  need  to  have  working \nexperience  in  their  respective  sectors  as  well  as  academic  credentials.  While  there  are \ninstitutions  where  a  high  percentage  of  teachers  have  both  academic  credentials  and \nprofessional  experience,  in  most  institutions  in  Shanxi  this  percentage  is  much  below  the \nindicative target of 30% set nationally. Many teachers lack practical knowledge of their sectors \nand actual practice in enterprises. There are also administrative obstacles to directly recruiting \nteachers  with  special  industry  experience  and  expertise  from  enterprises.  Without  close \ncooperation with enterprises, it is often difficult for TVET teachers to improve teaching through \npractical training in enterprises. Adequate incentives to qualified teachers is also an area to be \nreviewed. \n \n9.  A priority of Shanxi province as well as of the central Government is to establish well-\nequipped training and practice centers, to be shared among TVET institutions, as an effective \nmeans to improve teaching and learning in TVET. There is a need to develop (i) mechanisms \n ", "  3\nfor the effective sharing of these centers in Shanxi both technically and administratively among \nschools dispersed geographically, and (ii) mechanisms that support the financial sustainability of \nthese centers.  \n \n10.  Need  to  Deepen  TVET  Sector  Reform.  The  key  to  further  sector  reform  is  the \ncontinued transformation of a TVET system that focuses on classroom teaching and theoretical \nknowledge to one that imparts practical knowledge and hands-on experience to students. At \npresent,  many  schools  continue  to  use  outdated  teaching  materials.  To  be  labor-market-\noriented will require schools to overcome rigid models of teaching and learning, and to flexibly \nadjust their curriculum, course setting, teaching contents and methods according to changing \nlabor market demand. All that, in turn, will call for strengthened coordination and cooperation \nbetween schools and employers.  \n \n11.  Innovative mechanisms currently practiced in Shanxi include (i) allowing students to \nalternate between working and studying by semester; and (ii) giving students more flexibility to \nplan work/study through a credit system. It is important to assess the impacts of those and other \nmechanisms on enhancing the focus of teaching and learning on imparting practical knowledge \nand hands-on experience to students. Wider application of proven mechanisms will contribute \nsignificantly to raising the overall effectiveness of the sector in meeting market needs for skills. \nSchool management is also an area in need of strengthening. Modern education management \nskills  will  be  particularly  important  for  school  directors  in  the  context  of  rapid  economic \nrestructuring  and  development  in  Shanxi.  Systematically  developing  the  managerial  and \nfinancial skills of school directors will be an important component of sector reform. \n \n12.  Need  to  Strengthen  TVET  Financing.  Although  both  the  central  and  provincial \ngovernments have been allocating increasing resources for TVET, underfunding remains a key \nconstraint on the TVET system to expand its capacity and improve teaching and learning \nconditions. Tuition rates are determined and capped by the government price bureau, and \nschools face difficulties in borrowing from banks. As land and school buildings cannot legally be \nused as collateral (even for privately owned TVET schools), schools\u2019 creditworthiness suffers \nand banks consider lending to schools as too risky. A small number of schools have taken bank \nloans but on unattractive terms that often involve nonstandard, market-distorting practices and \nconditions. There is a need for a comprehensive assessment of policies and practices for \nimproving schools\u2019 access to the capital market as a means for resource mobilization. \n \n13.  Given  decentralized  financing  arrangements  and  due  to  uneven  regional  economic \ndevelopment, actual resources available for TVET schools from local governments differ widely \nacross prefectures and counties in Shanxi. With this fiscal arrangement, it is important to assess \nand  develop  effective  mechanisms  for  enhancing  provincial  fiscal  transfers  to  balance  the \nuneven resources actually reaching TVET. More recently, the provincial government decided \nthat at least 30% of urban education tax revenue and a part of enterprise training funds can be \nused for TVET (the tax was originally designed to support financing for compulsory education). \nGiven TVET\u2019s increasing social  and  economic significance,  additional sources  of financing \nshould be actively explored.  \n \n14.  Given decentralized TVET administration and financing, ADB has focused on supporting \nTVET sector reform and development at the provincial level in the PRC.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n15.  The impact of the TA is the transformation of the TVET system in Shanxi into a demand- \nand employment-driven and competence-based system in support of Shanxi\u2019s medium- and \nlong-term social and economic development. The outcome of the TA is the consideration by \nhigher authorities of the provincial and central governments of key TA policy recommendations \nfor improving the TVET system in Shanxi.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n16.  The output of the TA will be a main TA report, which will be supported by five sub-\nreports, namely, (i) New and Emerging Skills Needs for Social and Economic Development in \nShanxi, which will address issues raised in para. 4; (ii) Strengthening TVET\u2019s Labor Market \nLinkages which will address issues raised in para. 6; (iii) Strengthening TVET Capacity and \nQuality, which will address issues raised in paras. 7\u20139; (iv) Deepening TVET Reform and \nInnovation, which will address issues raised in paras. 10\u201311; and (v) Strengthening TVET \nFinancing, which will address issues raised in paras. 12\u201313. The main TA report will be based \non the analysis and recommendations of the five subreports, and integrate them into one \ncoherent report. Measures and mechanisms identified for implementation will be costed and \nprioritized. Shanxi\u2019s experiences and lessons learned may be useful to other provinces in the \nPRC, which are undergoing similar social and economic changes. Key TA recommendations will \nbe developed further into knowledge products for wider dissemination to the general public as \nwell as to stakeholders, through a variety of media including websites, printed materials, and at \nconferences.  \n \n17.  Five workshops and one conference will be held during TA implementation to share TA \nfindings and build consensus on key issues and recommendations among major stakeholders. \nThe workshops are tentatively planned to be held at regular intervals beginning with the TA \ninception workshop. A conference with national and international participants will be held toward \nthe end of TA implementation to disseminate findings, exchange experiences and information \non TVET development, and provide inputs for finalizing theTA outputs.  \n \n18.  The TA will combine desk research with fieldwork and surveys. The study on future \nprovincial needs for skilled workers may also require modeling and forecasting. Fieldwork will be \nimportant for most subreports. An external study visit will be conducted. Participants will include \nkey officials from relevant provincial government agencies and other stakeholders. The study \nvisit will offer an opportunity for (i) learning from international best practices first-hand, and (ii) \nexchanging experiences and lessons learned from other countries.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n2   ADB. 2006.

The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,200,000 equivalent, of which $600,000 will be \nfinanced  on  a  grant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program.  The  Government\u2019s  contribution, \nestimated at $600,000 equivalent, will cover remuneration of counterpart staff, and part of the \ncost of workshops and conference, fieldwork and surveying, related travel, the external study \nvisit, office space, meeting venues, and administrative and logistical support. The cost estimates \nand financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n20.  The TA will be implemented over 12 months from October 2007 to September 2008. The \nprovincial Bureau of Finance (BOF) and Bureau of Education (BOE) will be the Executing \nAgency (EA) and Implementing Agency (IA) of the TA, respectively. BOF and BOE will be \nresponsible for coordination and providing information and other conditions necessary for the \nconsultants to complete their tasks successfully. The Director of the International Division of \nBOF will be the provincial government\u2019s focal point for communication and coordination of TA \nimplementation. A provincial leading group for the TA will be established by end-June 2007, to \nprovide overall guidance and interagency coordination, and ensure effective and timely TA \nimplementation. The leading group will be chaired by a member of the provincial government, \nand members will include directors general or deputy directors general of BOF, BOE, and \nBureau of Labor and Social Security.  \n \n21.  A team of international and national consultants will be engaged for a total of 56 person-\nmonths of consulting services in the fields of sector planning and strategy, economic analysis \nand labor market forecasting, labor market linkages and mechanisms, TVET sector reform and \ndevelopment, private sector participation, TVET financing and resource mobilization, and rural \nto urban migration and TVET. The international consultants will have field and other working \nexperience in multilateral or bilateral financed projects on TVET reform and development in the \nPRC.  ADB will engage the consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). A firm will be selected based on the quality- \nand cost-based selection method (80% on quality and 20% on cost), using a simplified technical \nproposal. Consultant reports will be prepared in English and Chinese. Outline terms of reference \nfor the consultants are in Appendix 3. In addition to preparing reports and other responsibilities \noutlined  therein,  the  consultants  will  support  planning  and,  as  needed,  implementation  of \nfieldwork and the study visit, which will be organized by BOF and BOE, subject to ADB approval. \nOffice  equipment  financed  under  the  TA  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). The equipment will be turned \nover to BOF after TA implementation. ADB will establish an advance payment facility with BOF \nto  facilitate  implementation  of  the  TA  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Disbursement  of \nTechnical Assistance Grants.  \n \nIV.
