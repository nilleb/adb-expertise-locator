A summary environmental impact assessment was \nAssessment  prepared and circulated to the Board on 20 May 2005. \n   \nSector Investment  Power  and  energy  are  essential  for  economic  and  social \nProgram Description  development  in  Uttaranchal.  The  government  of  Uttaranchal \n(GOU) has a long-term roadmap to strengthen the power sector. \nBesides  capital  investments  to  increase  power  generation  and \nimprove transmission and distribution, the roadmap also includes \ninstitutional change and capacity building for policy reform and \nimproved financial management. Private sector participation in all \nparts of the power sector is an objective, as well as tariff regime \nimprovements and the establishment of sound regulatory, legal, \nand governance frameworks. The roadmap is centered on clean \nenergy  development  and  energy  efficiency,  which  are  fast \nbecoming  priority  themes  in  India,  with  particular  relevance  to \nstates with the resources and physical conditions to broaden the \ngeneration base. A key feature of the roadmap is that it blends, \nphases,  and  sequences  a  diverse  range  of  investment  and \nnoninvestment interventions over time. The overall objective is to \nraise output and efficiency while ensuring fully inclusive power \nservices  for  all  types  of  consumers:  residential,  industrial, \ncommercial, and public administrations.  \n \nThe capital investment program (the program) itself will require \nabout $12 billion over 2006\u20132018. This includes new assets and \nthe rehabilitation of existing assets in generation, transmission, \nand distribution. Given the relatively large size of the program, \nand  in  view  of  the  state\u2019s  limited  financial  resources  and \ninstitutional  capabilities,  the  investments  will  be  phased  and \ndistributed among public and private sponsors. Planned capital \ninvestments from 2006\u20132012 are estimated at about $5 billion.  \n \nThe  financing  plan  involves  central  and  state  government \nauthorities  (through  budget  allocations),  local  banks,  private \nsponsors, national utility companies, capital market operators, and \ninternational financial institutions including the Asian Development \nBank (ADB). International loan syndications and bond issues are \npossible, the latter of which may be enhanced through guarantee \nproducts available from multilateral financing institutions and the \n ", "ii \ninternational  insurance  market.  These  enhancements  can \nincrease maturities and bring down the total cost of funds to the \nissuer.  \n \nThe roadmap and the program (investment and noninvestment) \nare fully consistent with the government of India (GOI) \u201cPower For \nAll by 2012\u201d policy objective, and fits well with ADB\u2019s existing \nstrategy for the sector.  \n \nGeneration \n \nAt year-end 2005, Uttaranchal had generating capacity of 1,160 \nmegawatts (MW), entirely from hydropower plants. Total theoretical \npotential is estimated at 20,000 MW. Capacity expansions planned \nthrough to 2018 total about 10,000 MW. There are 14 projects \nunder construction, totaling 5,525 MW in new capacity by 2010. \nAn  additional  4,791  MW  are  in  the  development  stage,  with \ncommissioning due soon after 2010, and an additional 9,090 MW \nis  planned  beyond  that.  Approximately  $4  billion  in  new \ninvestment  is  required  for  new  generating  capacity  to  be \ncommissioned by 2012, most of which will be provided by central \npublic  sector  utilities  (CSPUs),  Uttaranchal  Jal  Vidyut  Nigam, \nLimited (UJVNL), the state generating utility, and private sector \ndevelopers. \n \nThe generation expansion program is dominated by clean energy \ndevelopment in the form of low-carbon generation operations, and \nenergy  efficiency  improvements  in  the  form  of  renovation  and \nsystem  loss  reduction.  While  most  of  the  new  hydropower \ncapacity during the first phase will come from large (more than \n100 MW) and medium (25\u2013100 MW) plants, the program includes \nsmall  run  of  river  hydropower  plants  (3\u201325  MW).  Numerous \ncandidate sites have been identified, with a cumulative capacity of \naround  1,000  MW,  about  10%  of  which  is  now  operating. \nIndependent power producers are expected to develop about half \nof the small hydropower plants (SHPPs).  SHPPs provide power \ndirectly  to  local  grids  (at  33  kilovolts  [kV]),  and  therefore  are \nintegral to meeting rural electrification objectives. SHPPs can be \nconstructed much faster than medium- and larger-sized ones, are \nenvironmentally friendly, and are expected to generate tradable \ncarbon  credits,  with  substantial  financial  upside  to  the  project \nsponsors. ADB is providing assistance to GOU to develop carbon \ncredit opportunities. \n \nTransmission \n \nThe  state-level  transmission  network  needs  to  be  expanded \nquickly to accommodate a four fold increase in generation and \nenergy transfers by 2012. Transmission expansion is integrated \nwith generation expansion activities, and calls for 785 kilometers \n(km) of 400 kV lines, 180 km of 220 kV lines, 665 km of 132 kV ", "iii \nlines, 8 substations, and auxiliary equipment. Power Transmission \nCorporation of Uttaranchal, Limited (PTCUL) is the lead project \nsponsor, and will require around $550 million to support these \ninvestments. \n \nDistribution \n \nThe sector roadmap targets 100% village electrification by 2008 \nand  100%  household  electrification  by  2012,  which  requires \nextending the 33 kV and 11 kV distribution networks. The state \ndistribution  company,  Uttaranchal  Power  Corporation  Limited \n(UPCL),  is  implementing  a  comprehensive  system  overhaul \nincluding energy audits, physical upgrades, expansion of service \nareas,  and  improvements  in  metering,  billing,  and  collection.  \nUPCL\u2019s  business  plan  calls  for  about  $370  million  in  new \ninvestment  through  2012,  which  is  being  met  through  central \nGovernment  incentive  programs,  state  budget  transfers,  and \nrevenue  collection  from  ongoing  operations.  The  company  is \nmoving  toward  fully  commercial  operations,  and  further \nrestructuring  covering  operational,  financial,  and  management \nmatters  is  being  considered  by  GOU,  the  Uttaranchal  Energy \nDepartment (UED), and UPCL management. External financing \nmay be required after the expiration of funds available under the \nAccelerated Power Development and Reform Program. \n \nPolicy Framework and Capacity  \n \nUttaranchal\u2019s power sector was unbundled beginning in 2001, and \noperations  have  been  rapidly  evolving  from  a  system  run  by \nregulated monopolies to one incorporating several private groups \nand more competitive market conditions. A number of reforms \nhave been implemented, and others will be phased in between \nnow  and  2012.  The  Uttaranchal  Electricity  Regulatory \nCommission (UERC) actively monitors and promotes reforms to \nsustain commercial operations. Generation is the most open of \nthe three subsectors, with central public sector utilities and private \ncompanies developing several major projects. The transmission \nsector has some current limitations to private sector involvement, \nbut the policy framework caters for public and/or private initiatives, \nincluding  joint  ventures  and  wholly  owned  private  sector \noperations, some of which may come on stream in the short to \nmedium  term.  As  noted  above,  the  distribution  subsector  is \nundergoing a system-wide overhaul.  Further restructuring will be \nimplemented  subject  to  careful  planning  and  extensive \nstakeholder  consultations.  In  the  meantime,  some  design, \nconstruction, and maintenance operations will be outsourced to \nthe private sector.  \n \nCapacity to implement the sector roadmap remains a constraint. \nAt  the  central  government  level  the  capacity  to  formulate  and \nexecute policy reforms is sound, and to a large extent already \n ", "iv \ntested, since this is done mainly by the Ministry of Power and the \nCentral Electricity Authority.  \n \nAt the state level, GOU, UED, UERC, and the utilities have strong \nplanning capability. Financial management and fiduciary oversight \nsystems are in place, but can benefit from additional assistance \nand  training.  Policy  formulation,  project  definition,  project \nmanagement, and project monitoring will be strengthened over the \nnear term, and ADB intervention includes support for capacity \nbuilding in these areas.  The utilities have the capacity to plan and \nissue tenders for civil works contracts, the purchase of plant and \nequipment, and the issuance of concessions, joint ventures, and \nmanagement  contracts.  ADB  is  providing  ongoing  technical \nassistance to improve capacity to comply with all relevant ADB \npolicies and procedures, including governance, procurement, and \nsafeguards. Additional support for these activities, including long-\nterm  human  resource  is  included  in  the  proposed  ADB \nintervention.  \n \nProposed ADB Intervention \n \nThe Government of India (GOI) and GOU have requested ADB to \nprovide $300 million to partly fund a subset of the investment \nprogram covering generation, transmission, and capacity building. \nThis represents a relatively small share of the total funding needs \nand financing plan. Having ADB as a partner (i) brings down the \ntotal  cost  of  funds,  (ii)  sets  out  standards  in  various  thematic \nareas, and (iii) helps to entice other long-term financiers to the \nsector. GOI and GOU have requested ADB to extend this finance \nin the form of a multitranche financing facility (MFF).  \n   \nMultitranche Financing  Up to $300 million to help fund the investment program during its \nFacility  first  phase.  The  Multitranche  Financing  Facility  (MFF)  will  be \nconverted  into  individual  loans  in  line  with  individual  project \nreadiness, as well as policy, safeguards, financial management, \nfiduciary  oversight,  and  capacity  building  action  plans.  These \nloans will be made from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources. The \nutilization period of the facility will be 7 years.  \n   \nRationale  Uttaranchal is one of India\u2019s poorest states. Clean energy and \ntourism are two important economic growth and poverty reduction \ndrivers.  The  state  has  undeveloped  hydropower  potential \nestimated at 20,000 MW. Harnessing this hydropower capacity is \nvital to meet all in-state demand and export power to surrounding \nstates,  and  support  investment  in  rural  and  other  productive \nsectors. ", "v \n  Uttaranchal\u2019s  power  sector  road  map  is  based  on  (i)  a \nmemorandum of understanding with the Government of India for \nunbundling the former State Electricity Board; (ii) the subsequent \nunbundling into three state-owned utilities; (iii) the implementation \nof  the  Accelerated  Power  Development  and  Reform  Program, \nwhich supports local grid strengthening and reduction of system \nlosses; (iv) a tripartite agreement between the state, the central \nGovernment, and the Reserve Bank of India for settling accounts \nbetween  the  former  State  Electricity  Board  and  its  unbundled \nsuccessors;  (v)  the  state\u2019s  new  industrial  policy  for  economic \ngrowth through the development of clean (no- and low-pollution) \nenterprises,  which  includes  provisions  for  private  sector \nparticipation  in  the  power  sector;  (vi)  the  creation  of  an \nindependent electricity regulator; (vii) the Accelerated Generation \nand Supply Program, which provides incentives for the renovation, \nmodernization, and upgrade (RMU) of existing power plants; and \n(viii)  a  series  of  tariff  orders  for  generation,  transmission,  and \ndistribution that support the commercialization of the state-owned \nutilities. \n \nImpact and Outcome  The  program  will  support  poverty  reduction  in  Uttaranchal.  It \nsupports  investments  and  enabling  conditions  conducive  to \neconomic growth and prosperity. Power remains a bottleneck to \neconomic  growth,  affecting  resident  and  industrial  consumers \nalike. The program will generate exports to neighboring states and \nimprove efficiency and cut energy leaks, operating and financial \nlosses in the system.  \n \nThe program will encourage reform, promote clean energy and \nenergy efficiency improvements, and build capacity to effectively \nmanage  the  ongoing  multi-billion  dollar  expansion  program. \nCapacity  building  activities  will  initially  concentrate  on \nimplementation  of  investments  funded  by  ADB,  and  will  be \nexpanded  to  support  the  broader  sector  reform  agenda  under \nGOU leadership.  \n \nThe ADB-supported investments will increase power supplies by a \nsignificant amount by 2012, from large and small plants, by adding \nnew  assets,  and  rehabilitating  existing  ones.  Transmission \nexpansion will enable a more efficient transfer of power within the \nstate, and the sale of excess power to the Northern Region grid. \nBy 2012, the exportable surplus will be sufficient to supply 12 \nmillion residential customers. Expanded and improved quality in \nthe service will cut costs, reduce the \u201ccost plus\u201d pressure on the \ntariff structure and benefit consumers. The SHPPs investments \nare expected to generate carbon credits, with significant financial \nupside to sponsors and consumers. ADB is providing ongoing \nassistance to expand expertise in Uttaranchal for carbon credit \nidentification and trading.  \n   \n ", "vi \nCost Estimates and  Investment Program 2006\u20132012                                  $ Million  \nFinancing Plan   Generation     \n    UJVNL Large Hydropower  700 \n    UJVNL Small Hydropower  335 \n    Central Public Sector Utility and/or Independent Power  \n    Companies  3,200 \nTransmission  550 \nDistribution  370 \nTotal  5,155 \nFinancing Plan \nDomestic   \n  UJVNL  440 \n  PTCUL  100 \n  UPCL  40 \n  GOU  580 \n  Central Power Sector Utilities  1,600 \n  Private Sector  750 \n  Power Finance Corporation   300 \n  Local Banks, Private Equity, and Capital Markets  245 \n International   \n   ADB  300 \n  Bilaterals   300 \n  International Financial Institutions  500 \n Total  5,155 \n   \nFacility Amount and  The  facility  will  provide  up  to  $300  million,  secured  from  the \nTerms  Ordinary  Capital  Resources  of  ADB,  with  final  terms  and \nconditions  to  be  established  under  individual  loan  agreements \nbased  on  prevailing  ADB  policies.

Advanced procurement action \nwill  be  allowed  to  facilitate  timely  implementation  of  the \ninvestments. \n   \nConsulting Services  All consultants financed under each ADB loan will be selected and \nengaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  for  the  recruitment  of \ndomestic consultants acceptable to ADB. \n \nConsulting  services  will  initially  focus  on  implementation  and \nproject  management  activities  including  subproject  design, \nsafeguards  evaluations,  procurement,  financial  management, \nreporting,  and  staff  training.  Additional  tasks  which  may  be \ncovered  are  assistance  with  planning  and  policy  formulation; \ncarbon credit identification, certification and marketing; corporate \ndevelopment, including human resource development, information \ntechnology upgrades, and creation of a state-level power trading \ncompany.   \n   \nInvestment Program  The program covers investment and noninvestment interventions \nBenefits and  benefiting  all  consumers  in  rural  and  urban  areas,  including \nBeneficiaries  residential,  industrial,  public  administrations,  and  commercial \nestablishments. It will deliver on both quantitative and qualitative \ntargets  envisaged  under  the  Power  For  All  by  2012  policy \nobjective. Besides generating more power supplies for users in \nthe  state  itself  (now  in  deficit),  the  program  will  also  provide \nsubstantial surplus power for exports, which is expected to be a \nmajor source of revenue for the state.  \n \nThe program is founded on clean energy development, a field \nwhere Uttaranchal has a clear comparative advantage vis-\u00e0-vis \nother states. Expanding clean energy capacity will generate local, \nregional,  and  global  environmental  benefits.  Local  air  quality, \nparticularly indoor air quality, will improve with the substitution of \nelectricity for biomass (animal dung and wood) and kerosene. \nRegional air quality will be preserved by offsetting the expansion \nof thermal generating capacity. Carbon credit trading is expected \nto create significant dividends, with projected upside up to 15% of \ntotal  capital  outlays.  Energy  efficiency  will  be  improved  with \nsubstantial  reductions  in  transmission  and  distribution  system \nlosses. Transmission investments are necessary to make other \n ", "viii \ninvestments  in  generation  and  distribution  possible.  The \ninvestment  program  will  obviously  create  employment,  tax \nrevenues, and royalties to the state.  \n \nRisks and Assumptions  The  program  is  accompanied  by  some  risks,  in  particular  cost \n  overruns, commissioning delays, and lack of reforms necessary for \n  sector sustainability.  \n   \n  Given the \u201ccost plus\u201d commercial or tariff regime prevalent in the \n  industry in India today, cost overruns can be partially passed on to \n  consumers, with negative financial and economic effects, especially \n  on residential customers.  This risk is small. The cost projections \n  are  based  on  conservative  assumptions,  and  many  of  these \n  investments fall within the jurisdiction of the central power utilities\u2014\n  experienced groups in terms of project preparation and execution.  \n  Implementation is being conducted more and more frequently on \n  the basis of tendered engineering, procurement and construction \n  turnkey  contracts  (EPCs),  which  are  subject  to  considerable \n  penalties  on  budget  and  time  overruns,  and  come  with  project \n  completion and commissioning guarantees.  \n   \n  Commissioning delays would put at risk not only in-state supplies \n  but also exports to neighboring areas. Such risk is contained and \n  managed through the \u201cconcession\u201d contracts awarded to the short-\n  listed sponsors. About 14 projects are already under way and most \n  of the remaining ones are at an advanced stage of development \n  and/or planning.  \n   \n  Capacity building and public policy reform are essential to the long-\n  term  growth  and  sustainability  of  the  sector.  The  risk  of  a \n  turnaround  (or  a  material  slowdown)  in  the  reform  process  is \n  possible but unlikely. GOI and GOU are publicly committed to the \n  reform process, because reliable high quality power service is a key \n  driver for growth and poverty reduction. The sector is also crucial \n  for  other  investments  to  materialize,  which  in  turn  creates \n  employment, better public goods and services and incomes. High-\n  quality and reliable power supply benefits people and industry in \n  rural and urban areas, and many critical public services, ranging \n  from water and wastewater to education to health services. The \n  reform process is well underway, and needs to be further nurtured.  \n \n ", "ix \nWarranties and  Uttaranchal has a well-defined power sector roadmap, a clear \nRepresentations  investment  and  noninvestment  program,  and  the  people  and \ninstitutions to deliver on objectives and targets. The provision of \nADB finance through a multitranche facility requires an agreement \non  key  warranties  and  representations  which  are  intended  to \nensure program success. A framework financing agreement (FFA) \nhas been negotiated, which captures critical provisions for ADB \nfinancing including:   \n \n(i)  subproject eligibility criteria, selection, and implementation, \n(ii)  capacity building,  \n(iii)  safeguards framework,  \n(iv)  procurement and disbursement procedures,  \n(v)  financial management and fiduciary oversight, \n(vi)  monitoring, administration, and reporting.  \n \nADB will provide direct support to GOU and the executing and \nimplementing  agencies  responsible  for  program  implementation, \nfrom  headquarters  and  through  the  India  Resident  Mission.  A \nprogram support office has been established, which will coordinate \nspecific implementation tasks, including  procurement, subproject \nmanagement,  monitoring,  and  supervision.  It  will  comprise \nprofessional,  experienced  staff  especially  in  the  areas  of \nsafeguards,  financial  management,  administration  and  reporting. \nAn MFF can be a flexible instrument for the authorities, but its \nviability  requires  a  strong  local  presence  and  quality  resources \nallocated to implementation.   \n \nADB management and staff will report regularly to ADB\u2019s Board of \nDirectors  on  the  implementation  of  the  program  and  the  MFF. \nBoard Information Reports will be submitted on an annual basis or \nmore frequently if necessary. Each new financing request to be \nconverted  into  a  new  loan  will  require  evaluation  on  the \nperformance of the previous one.  ADB will conduct periodic review \nmissions,  which  will  include  due  diligence  on  warranties  and \nrepresentations made to ADB. In addition, staff will report on any \nissues  or  problems  faced  by  the  authorities  and  the  execution \nagencies under the program, and the remedial actions suggested to \novercome them. \n

THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche  financing  facility  (MFF)  to  India  for  the  Uttaranchal  Power  Sector  Investment \nProgram (Investment Program).1 \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  The Government of India has confirmed its intent to provide universal power service at \nan affordable price by 2012, which will require an estimated 100,000 megawatts (MW) of new \ncapacity. The Government also intends to shift the ratio of thermal to hydropower generation \nfrom the current 75:25 to 60:40. Hydropower2 is targeted for 30% of new generating capacity \nduring the next two 5-year plans, of which 10,000 MW is proposed for development in the state \nof Uttaranchal between 2005 and 2018. Power sector analysis is presented in Appendix 2.  \n \n3.  The 2003 Electricity Act is intended to improve governance in the power sector through \ncontinued institutional restructuring and improved management of sector entities to ensure long-\nterm sustainability. Compulsory metering, open access to transmission systems, facilitation of \npower trading, lifeline tariffs for the poor and rural consumers, and rationalization of tariffs have \nbeen initiated. Generation, transmission, and distribution have been separated. The Central \nElectricity  Regulatory  Commission  has  prescribed  detailed  rules  for  cost  accounting  and \nallowable  tariffs.  Wholesale  electricity  sales  are  priced  at  the  cost  of  transmission  and \nproduction, including an allowed rate of return on equity investment of 14%. The costs of \nhydropower generation are estimated to be as low as $0.013 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) averaged \nover a plant\u2019s lifetime, with initial costs ranging from $0.04 to $0.05 per kWh. In Uttaranchal, \nconsumer tariffs range from $0.03 per kWh to $0.078 per kWh, and in 2003, the average retail \ntariff across all consumer categories was $0.047 per kWh. \n \n4.  Uttaranchal was created on 9 November 2000 by splitting the state of Uttar Pradesh.3 Per \ncapita electricity utilization in the state is below the national average (about 284 kWh per capita \nper year compared with the national average of 606 kWh per capita per year), and economic \ndevelopment has been constrained by the lack of an available and affordable power supply. In \n2003, statewide demand exceeded in-state supply by 10.2%. In 2004, this gap between demand \nand supply decreased to less than 5%. Electricity utilization has increased by 10 to 16% per year \nsince 2000 and is expected to continue increasing at comparable rates through 2012. The state \nhas little or no fossil fuel resources, and has therefore focused on developing hydropower and the \nassociated transmission system for meeting local demand within the state and for exports of \nsurplus power.  \n \n5.  The former State Electricity Board (SEB) has been transformed into three state-owned \nutility companies: Uttaranchal Power Corporation, Limited (UPCL) is responsible for distribution \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2 India is heavily dependent on fossil fuel imports (coal, crude oil, and natural gas). Hydropower has a distinct \ncomparative advantage for the provision of electric power.  \n3 Uttaranchal was created as a separate state to accelerate economic development, which depends on two key \nresources: tourism and hydropower.   \n ", "2 \nat 33 kilovolts (kV) and lower, rural electrification, and power trading;4 the Power Transmission \nCorporation of Uttaranchal, Limited (PTCUL) is responsible for high-voltage transmission lines \nand substations from 132 kV to 400 kV;5 and Uttaranchal Jal Vidyut Nigam Limited (UJVNL) \ntakes a lead role in developing hydropower projects greater than 1 MW and manages private \nsector participation.6 Private sector participation is open for more than 40 hydropower plants \n(HPPs) of less than 25 MW capacity and 13 projects ranging from 25 MW to 100 MW. The \nUttaranchal Electric Regulatory Commission (UERC) was established as the independent state \nregulator in 2002.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n6.  Energy services, especially reliable electric power, are essential for economic and social \ndevelopment  in  Uttaranchal.  The  government  of  Uttaranchal  (GOU)  has  developed  a \ncomprehensive roadmap to strengthen the sector over the long run. Besides capital investments \nto increase power generation and improve transmission and distribution, the roadmap includes \ninstitutional change and capacity building for policy reform and improved financial performance. \nPrivate sector participation in all parts of the power sector is an objective, as well as tariff regime \nimprovements and the establishment of sound regulatory, legal, and governance frameworks. \nThe  roadmap  emphasizes  clean  energy  development  in  the  form  of  low-carbon  power \ngeneration, and energy efficiency via renovation, modernization, and upgrade (RMU) of existing \npower plants, which are critical pieces of a sustainable energy strategy. A key feature of the \nroadmap  is  that  it  blends,  phases,  and  sequences  a  diverse  range  of  investment  and \nnoninvestment interventions over time. The overall objective is to raise output and efficiency \nwhile ensuring fully inclusive power services for all types of consumers: residential, industrial, \ncommercial,  and  public  administration.  Planned  capital  investments  from  2006\u20132012  are \nestimated at about $5 billion. The Government has requested external financial and technical \nassistance (TA) for implementing critical parts of this investment program. \n \n1.  Generation \n \n7.  The Northern Region grid has a power deficit that will persist for several years, but that \ncan be cost-effectively ameliorated by developing hydropower in the mountainous states of \nJammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, and Uttaranchal (Appendix 2). Uttaranchal has the \ngreatest  undeveloped  hydropower  capacity  in  the  Northern  Region  grid,  with  20,000  MW \nestimated to be commercially viable, but only 1,160 MW operating at year-end 2005. The GOU \nroad map comprises an Investment Program centered on hydropower generation,7 upgrade of \nexisting transmission system, new high-voltage transmission lines and substations, distribution \nsystem  upgrades  and  expansion,  including  rural  electrification,  and  capacity  building  for \nimproved sector efficiency.8  \n \n8.  The state is currently a net importer of electric power, but generates a seasonal surplus \nand plans to become a net exporter of power by 2010 by expanding hydropower and high-voltage \n                                                 \n4  Power generation units are also allowed to engage in power trading according to provisions in the 2003 Electricity \nAct. Uttaranchal policy currently allows power trading to be managed by UPCL, with the intention of creating a \npower trading company in the near future.  \n5  The Power Grid Corporation India, Limited will operate 765 kV lines.  \n6  The Uttaranchal Renewable Energy Development Agency takes a lead role for projects of less than 1 MW. It also \nmanages renewable energy projects, including off-grid development, with some support from bilateral donors and \nnon-government organizations. \n7  The HPPs associated with the proposed transmission lines to be funded by ADB are all run-of-river designs.  \n8  UPCL and the Uttaranchal Renewable Energy Development Agency are responsible for grid-connected and off-\ngrid rural electrification, respectively. ", "3 \ntransmission capacity. Currently 14 projects totaling 5,525 MW are under construction9 and will \nbe commissioned between now and 2010. An additional 4,791 MW are under development, with \nexpected commissioning dates after 2010, and another 9,090 MW are planned (see Maps 1 and \n2, and Appendix 2). The key developers are UJVNL, the state generating utility; central public \nsector utilities, including the National Thermal Power Corporation, the National Hydropower \nDevelopment  Corporation,  and  the  Tehri  Hydropower  Development  Corporation;  and \nindependent power producers (IPPs).10 The existing HPPs were constructed in the 1970s and \n1980s  in  association  with  irrigation  systems  and  require  major  overhauls.  A  program  for \nrenovation, modernization, and upgrade (RMU) of existing HPPs has been defined with an \nestimated cost of about $150.0 million.  \n \n9.  The generation expansion program is dominated by clean energy development in the \nform of low-carbon generation operations, and energy efficiency improvements in the form of \nrenovation and system loss reduction. While most of the new hydropower capacity during the \nfirst phase will come from large (more than 100 MW) and medium (25\u2013100 MW) plants, the \nprogram includes small run of river hydropower plants (3\u201325 MW). Numerous candidate sites \nhave been identified, with a cumulative capacity of around 1,000 MW, about 10% of which is \nnow operating. Independent power producers are expected to develop about half of the small \nhydropower plants (SHPPs). SHPPs provide power directly to local grids (at 33 kilovolts [kV]), \nand therefore are integral to meeting rural electrification objectives. SHPPs can be constructed \nmuch  faster  than  medium-  and  larger-sized  ones,  are  environmentally  friendly,  and  are \nexpected to generate tradable carbon credits, with substantial financial upside to the project \nsponsors. ADB is providing assistance to GOU to develop carbon credit opportunities. \n \n  2.  Transmission \n \n10.  The state-level transmission network needs to be expanded quickly to accommodate a \nfour fold increase in generation and energy transfers by 2012. Transmission expansion is \nintegrated with generation expansion activities, and calls for 785 kilometers (km) of 400 kV \nlines, 180 km of 220 kV lines, 665 km of 132 kV lines, 8 substations, and auxiliary equipment. \nPower Transmission Corporation of Uttaranchal, Limited (PTCUL) is the lead project sponsor, \nand will require around $550 million to support these investments. \n \n  3.  Distribution \n \n11.  The sector roadmap targets 100% village electrification by 2008 and 100% household \nelectrification by 2012, which requires extending the 33 kV and 11 kV distribution networks. The \nstate distribution company, Uttaranchal Power Corporation Limited (UPCL), is implementing a \ncomprehensive  system  overhaul  including  energy  audits,  physical  upgrades,  expansion  of \nservice areas, and improvements in metering, billing, and collection. UPCL\u2019s business plan calls \nfor about $370 million in new investment through 2012, which is being met through central \nGovernment incentive programs, state budget transfers, and revenue collection from ongoing \noperations. External financing may be required after the expiration of funds available under the \nAccelerated Power Development and Reform Program. The company is moving toward fully \ncommercial operations (see Appendix 2), and further restructuring is being considered by GOU, \nthe Uttaranchal Energy Department (UED), and UPCL management.  \n                                                 \n9  This figure includes the Tehri and Koteshwar projects, totaling 2,400 MW, which will transmit power directly to the \n     Northern Region grid in Uttar Pradesh. These HPPs are not connected physically to and are not included in the \n     proposed Project. \n10  Central public sector utilities and IPPs are required to give 12% of their generation output to the state as a royalty \n     for the use of the rivers. \n ", "4 \n  4.  Policy Framework and Capacity  \n \n12.  Uttaranchal\u2019s power sector was unbundled beginning in 2001, and operations have been \nrapidly evolving from a system run by regulated monopolies to one incorporating several private \ngroups and more competitive market conditions. A number of reforms have been implemented, \nand others will be phased in between now and 2012. The Uttaranchal Electricity Regulatory \nCommission (UERC) actively monitors and promotes reforms to sustain commercial operations. \nGeneration is the most open of the three subsectors, with central public sector utilities and \nprivate companies developing several major projects. The transmission sector has some current \nlimitations  to  private  sector  involvement,  but the  policy  framework  caters  for  public  and/or \nprivate initiatives, including joint ventures and wholly owned private sector operations, some of \nwhich may come on stream in the short to medium term. As noted above, the distribution \nsubsector is undergoing a system-wide overhaul.  Further restructuring will be implemented \nsubject to careful planning and extensive stakeholder consultations. In the meantime, some \ndesign, construction, and maintenance operations will be outsourced to the private sector.  \n \n13.  Capacity  to  implement  the  sector  roadmap  remains  a  constraint.  At  the  central \ngovernment level the capacity to formulate and execute policy reforms is sound, and to a large \nextent already tested, since this is done mainly by the Ministry of Power (MOP) and the Central \nElectricity Authority (CEA).  \n \n14.  At the state level, GOU, UED, UERC, and the utilities have strong planning capability. \nPolicy  formulation,  project  definition,  project  management,  and  project  monitoring  will  be \nstrengthened over the near term, and ADB intervention includes support for capacity building in \nthese areas. The utilities have the capacity to plan and issue tenders for civil works contracts, \nthe purchase of plant and equipment, and the issuance of concessions, joint ventures, and \nmanagement contracts. ADB is providing ongoing technical assistance to improve capacity to \ncomply with all relevant ADB policies and procedures.  \n \n5.  The Asian Development Bank\u2019s Strategy in the Power Sector \n15.  The Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) assistance for the energy sector as outlined in \nthe 2004 and 2005 country strategy and program updates11 has six main priorities: (i) reforming \nthe power sector; (ii) promoting higher efficiency and low-carbon power sources, for example, \nrun-of-river  hydropower  projects  and  renewable  energy;  (iii)  expanding  and  optimizing \ntransmission  and  distribution  systems;  (iv)  strengthening  institutions  to  implement  reforms \nrequired by the 2003 Electricity Act, including the development of more flexible power delivery \nand trading systems; (v) promoting private sector participation; and (vi) encouraging energy \nconservation  and  ensuring  environmental  and  social  sustainability.  To  support  the \nGovernment\u2019s goal of Power For All by 2012, ADB\u2019s future strategy for the power sector will be \nin  synergy  with  the  10th  and  11th  Development  Plans.  ADB  will  continue  to  expand  its \npromotion of state-level power sector reforms by including more states, such as West Bengal \nand the northeastern states, and by deepening its efforts in the states in which it is currently \nactive, such as Assam, Kerala, and Madhya Pradesh. The proposed intervention in Uttaranchal \nis consistent with the strategy of supporting state-level sector reforms, in this case with the \nemphasis on the generation and transmission subsectors that complement ongoing reforms in \nthe distribution subsector. ADB intervention will promote knowledge transfer in relation to best \npractices  in  the  international  power  sector,  improve  corporate  governance  in  state-owned \n                                                 \n11  ADB. 2004.

In the past, ADB extended assistance to discrete power projects in various states as well \nas to the central public sector utilities. This strategy enabled ADB to support many projects, but \nspread ADB\u2019s resources too thinly, with the result that desired policy reforms were not achieved. \nSince 2000, ADB has focused on states committed to reforming and restructuring the power \nsector to achieve holistic change in macroeconomic management. With the implementation of \nthe 2003 Electricity Act, ADB\u2019s focus has shifted toward strengthening system expansion and \npromoting commercial operations with sector and investment loan support. At the national level, \nprojects supporting the development of interstate transmission systems have been fundamental \nto ADB\u2019s overall energy sector program. ADB\u2019s intervention in the transmission subsector has \nimproved commercialization and overall operating efficiencies.  \n \n17.  The evaluation of two projects12 provides additional key findings, namely: (i) ADB\u2019s \nenergy policy to promote cleaner energy sources and reduce reliance on coal-fired generating \ncapacity is reconfirmed given overall environmental and cost implications, (ii) tariffs can be \nraised without reducing net project benefits to the poor,13 (iii) sector restructuring should be \nimplemented gradually rather than in the form of \u201cshock therapy,\u201d and (iv) turnkey contracts are \npreferable to multiple supply and construction contracts in relation to enhancing the efficiency of \nproject implementation. \n \n18.  These  lessons  have  been  incorporated  into  the  proposed  investment  design.  The \ninvestments specifically target clean energy development. Tariff reforms have been initiated, \nand further tariff changes will be based on commercial principles. Further sector restructuring is \nbased  on  the  current  institutional  arrangements  (new  utilities,  independent  regulatory \ncommission). Procurement packages have been formulated to optimize implementation. \n \n7.  External Assistance \n \n19.  A major portion of external assistance to India\u2019s power sector has come from ADB, the \nCanadian International Development Agency, the Department for International Development of \nthe  United  Kingdom,  the  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation,  Kreditanstalt  f\u00fcr \nWiederaufbau of the Government of Germany, the US Agency for International Development \n(Appendix 3), and World Bank. Uttaranchal has received power sector assistance from the \nJapan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  for  the  280  MW  Dauliganga  hydropower  project \n(through  the  National  Hydropower  Development  Corporation)  and  from  the  Canadian \nInternational Development Agency and the Canadian Commercial Corporation for RMU at the \n144 MW Chilla HPP.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n12 ADB. 1986.

Policy Context and Dialogue \na.   Uttaranchal Power Development Policy, Strategy, and Reforms \n \n20.  GOU is committed to sector reforms in conformity with the 2003 Electricity Act and the \nnational electricity policy of February 2005. The latter is intended to promote implementation of \nthe Electricity Act, calling for power for all by 2012 (including rural electrification), reduced T&D \nand aggregate technical and commercial losses, better cost recovery and targeting of subsidies, \ngreater  private  sector  participation,  full  development  of  hydropower,  use  of  information \ntechnology for greater operational efficiencies, and protection of consumers\u2019 interests (Appendix \n2). \n \n21.  Uttaranchal  has  adopted  these  policy  objectives  through  (i)  a  memorandum  of \nunderstanding  with  the  Government  of  India  for  unbundling  the  former  SEB;  (ii)  the \nimplementation of the Accelerated Power Development and Reform Program, which supports \nlocal grid strengthening and reduction of system losses; (iii) a tripartite agreement between the \nstate, the central Government, and the Reserve Bank of India for settling accounts between the \nSEB and its unbundled successors; (iv) the Uttaranchal new industrial policy for economic \ngrowth through the development of clean (no- and low-pollution) enterprises, which includes \nprovisions for private sector participation in the power sector; (v) the creation of an independent \nelectricity  regulator;  (vi)  the  Accelerated  Generation  and  Supply  Program,  which  provides \nincentives for RMU of existing power plants; and (vii) a series of tariff orders for generation, \ntransmission, and distribution that support the commercialization of state-owned utilities. The \nstate is implementing the nationwide scheme for accelerating rural and village electrification, the \nRajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana,14 which provides supplemental financing to states \nto meet the Power For All By 2012 objective.  \n \n22.  The  legislative  and  policy  framework  in  Uttaranchal  is  conducive  to  the \ncommercialization  of  the  power  sector  in  an  economically  efficient  manner.  The  state  is \ndeveloping  hydropower  on  a  least-cost  basis  to  provide  improved  electric  service  to  all \nconsumers  at  fair  prices  and  develop  an  exportable  surplus  to  support  economic  growth. \nRestructuring, including the separation of Uttaranchal\u2019s grid operations from those of Uttar \nPradesh,  has  improved  operational  and  service  efficiency  (Appendix  2).  Private  sector \nparticipation is encouraged, but actual investment has been limited to the generation subsector. \nADB\u2019s intervention will promote economic efficiency and commercial operations.  \n \n23.  The state power sector has made a transition from the former SEB monopoly to a \nmonopsony,15 with full regulation of transmission and distribution and limited competition in \ngeneration.  Further  evolution  to  wholesale  competition  is  being  fostered  by  power  trading \nbetween generating plants and distribution units. Uttaranchal has power banking and trading \narrangements with Delhi, Haryana, and Punjab that take advantage of complementary seasonal \nsurpluses. Currently 15% of generation capacity can be made available to the open market \n(after fulfilling in-state demand) and dispatch is on a merit order basis (lowest cost of generation \ngets preferential dispatch).16 UPCL currently manages the power trading activity. GOU plans to \n                                                 \n14 The Government of India, GOU, and the Rural Electrification Corporation signed a memorandum of Understanding \n    on 23 June 2005 for implementation of this program. \n15  ADB.  2004.

", "7 \nincorporate a state-level power trading company in the next few years that will be supported by \nthe ADB intervention.17 \n \nb.  Regulatory System \n24.  Further to the 2003 Electricity Act, UERC was created as an independent, state-level \nregulatory  agency,  legally  empowered  to  operate  as  an  honest  broker  between  the  state \ngovernment, utilities, IPPs, and consumers. Utilities and IPPs (licensees) are required to petition \nUERC  for  tariffs,  and  after  consideration  of  stakeholders\u2019  inputs,  UERC  rules  on  tariff \napplications.  The  resulting  tariff  orders  are  the  key  instrument  of  regulation  and  sector \ngovernance.  Licensees  are  allowed  to  appeal  the  tariff  orders,  which  may  eventually  be \nresolved by court rulings. Transmission and distribution systems are currently operated by \nlicensed  monopolies  (PTCUL  and  UPCL,  respectively).  PTCUL  acts  as  a  common  carrier \nproviding open access to all generating plants. The generation subsector is competitive, with \nUJVNL,  the  central  public  sector  utilities,  and  several  IPP  companies  actively  operating, \nconstructing, and developing new power plants.  \n \n25.  UERC has aggressively implemented the tariff order system, which has been the key \ndriver of restructuring and commercialization, especially in the distribution subsector. UERC has \nlimited professional staff and a single chairperson. It plans to add more officers in the near \nfuture, which will improve its professional capabilities. UERC can avail itself of capacity building \nsupported by ADB\u2019s intervention (Appendix 4).18  \n \nc.  Tariffs \n26.  The tariff orders support the rationalization of operating costs and the commercialization \nof overall system operations. Most important in the Indian context, the tariff orders reflect the \nofficial viewpoint that electric power will be provided on a cost of supply basis and that all \nconsumers  will  pay  for  electric  service.  Tariffs  include  consideration  of  good  governance, \nfinancial sustainability, distributive justice, economic efficiency, and fair pricing. The tariff-setting \nprocess  is  consistent  with  ADB  guidance.19  The  tariff  orders  address  inadequate  financial \nmanagement,  weak  corporate  governance,  inefficient  operation,  and  obsolete  operational \nprocedures, especially in the distribution subsector (Appendix 2). \n \n27.  The tariff orders are periodically updated to accommodate adjustments based on the \nutilities\u2019 investment programs, provide a framework for rational pricing structure, and allow a \n14%  return  on  equity.  Distribution  tariffs  include  lifeline  tariffs  for  poor  households  and \ngraduated increases in tariffs (25% every 3 months) for unmetered connections. T&D losses are \nto be reduced by 20% between 2003 and 2008 from 28% to 23%. Universal metering is \nrequired.20 A pricing incentive in the form of a rebate is provided for high-tension industrial \ncustomers (connected at 11 kV and above), which account for about 20% of power sales. Time \n                                                 \n17 GOU has commissioned an independent analysis of power sector development at the state level that includes a \nreview  of  opportunities  for  power  trading  as  well  as  of  distribution  reforms.  GOU  plans  to  incorporate  an \nindependent power trading company after a daily, year-round power surplus has been established.   \n18 UERC plans to expand from its current one officer to three officers in the next year, and additional professional staff \nare anticipated as well. ADB has included the addition of two officers as an assurance (see para. 77). \n19 ADB. 2003. Setting User Charges for Public Services: Policies and Practice at the Asian Development Bank.

Manila. \n20 Installation of advanced electronic metering has resulted in a 10% reduction in T&D losses in some areas. \n ", "8 \nof day pricing is also extended to these customers (25% surcharge over the base tariff). A \nrebate is now available for residential consumers who install solar water heating systems. \n \n28.  The implementation of new tariff orders has been driving commercialization, but not \nwithout resistance from the utilities. UERC has aggressively interpreted the utilities\u2019 financial \ncondition and fiscal structure in a manner that has reduced both wholesale and retail tariffs. This \nhas been beneficial to end users and to UPCL, which has realized an increase in its gross \nmargin: in recent years it has been purchasing power at an average price of Rs1.0 per kWh and \nselling to end users at an average price of Rs2.5 per kWh. UJVNL, which believes that the \ncurrent tariffs are insufficient to create retained earnings for new investment, has challenged the \nreduction of the wholesale generating tariffs. UERC believes that the reduced generating tariffs \naccurately reflect the fact that UJVNL inherited fully amortized and depreciated assets from the \nformer Uttar Pradesh SEB. The uncertainties related to UERC\u2019s interpretation of utility financial \nstatements versus cost of supply principles are expected to disappear as new investments \nbegin to dominate utility operations and as UERC and the utilities gain more experience through \nsuccessive tariff petitions and orders. ADB\u2019s intervention will promote reconciliation of tariff \nissues  and  rationalization  of  tariffs,  with  assurances  for  cost  recovery  for  ADB-supported \ninvestments.  \n \nd.  Governance \n29.  The SEB has been unbundled into three limited liability corporations, 100% owned by \nGOU.  UJVNL  and  PTCUL  are  relatively  new  organizations  with  strong  capital  structures \nconsisting of low debt and healthy liquidity. UPCL continues to experience large nontechnical \nlosses  and  has  been  directed  via  tariff  orders  to  enact  a  comprehensive  loss  reduction \nprogram.21 The utilities\u2019 financial and operational performance is expected to improve in the \nnear term.  \n \n30.  ADB\u2019s intervention will support the transition of the generation and transmission utilities \nfrom the traditional public utility organizational model, with a large staff handling all business \noperations, toward an asset management type of structure, with minimum full-time staff and \nextensive  outsourcing  of  certain  functions.  An  initial  step  in  this  transition  process  is  the \nadoption of turnkey types of contracts for engineering, procurement, and construction of new \npower system infrastructure. The ADB-supported investments will be the first use of these types \nof contracts in the state.  \n \n31.  Corporate management is shifting toward a performance-oriented system with open \nrecruitment  for  management  positions  and  independent  board  members.  International \naccounting standards are being practiced or adopted.22 Billing and collection systems are being \nupgraded, especially for the distribution company.23 ADB has sought appropriate assurances to \nimprove overall corporate governance, with capacity building included to support the corporate \ngovernance improvements.  \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n21  UERC has noted that universal metering in the state\u2019s three major urban load centers would be the best near-term \nstep for reducing nontechnical losses. UPCL is in the process of installing modern electronic meters and is \nconsidering using prepaid metering systems. \n22  Internal audit committees are to be given full autonomy. \n23  UPCL is planning to implement online billing and collection by the end of 2006. ", "9 \ne.  Public-Private Sector Development Strategy \n \n32.  GOU  is  cognizant  of  the  need  for  private  investment  to  meet  the  sector\u2019s  overall \nfinancing requirements, and has proceeded to use private capital methodically as a complement \nto government-led investments in a broad public-private partnership, beginning with private \nparticipation in generation. UJVNL manages an IPP participation program, with more than 50 \nout of 99 projects slated for private participation.24 The response from IPPs has been positive, \nalthough  limited  mainly  to  domestic  firms.  The  IPP  share  of  new  hydropower  projects  is \nexpected to grow gradually in the near term. UERC has encouraged IPP participation and \ndisputes about tariffs have not emerged.  \n \n33.  UPCL must improve its overall operating efficiency and financial health before it can \ncommence ownership diversification. PTCUL plans to open selected transmission segments to \na competitive bidding process while retaining the role of asset manager. PTCUL may be opened \nup  to  private  investment  pending  successful  private  participation  in  interstate  transmission \nprojects. Recognizing the enormous capital requirements for hydropower development, UJVNL \nhas proposed raising equity in domestic capital markets via a limited public offering, but no \ntimetable for such an offering has been set.  \n \nIII.  INVESTMENT PROPOSAL \n34.  The Government of India (GOI) and GOU have requested ADB to provide $300 million to \npartly fund a subset of the investment program covering generation, transmission, and capacity \nbuilding. This represents a relatively small share of the total funding needs and financing plan. \nHaving ADB as a partner (i) brings down the total cost of funds, (ii) sets out standards in various \nthematic areas, and (iii) helps to attract other long-term financiers to the sector. GOI and GOU \nhave requested ADB to extend this finance in the form of a multitranche financing facility (MFF). \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n35.  ADB will finance part of the Investment Program from 2006 through 2012, resulting in \nsufficient power capacity to meet all in-state demand and achieve a year-round exportable \nsurplus by 2010.25 The generation and transmission parts of the Investment Program through \n2012, with candidate subprojects highlighted, are presented in Appendix 2. New SHPP capacity \nwill provide additional power to local grids in rural areas and is expected to meet about one third \nof the projected in-state, nonindustrial power demand at the time of commissioning. Additional \npower output from the RMU of existing HPPs will be sufficient to meet small- and medium-scale \nindustrial  demand  at  the  time  of  commissioning.  The  expansion  of  PTCUL\u2019s  state-level \ntransmission grid will (i) improve system reliability; (ii) facilitate in-state and interregional power \ntransfers; (iii) facilitate a reduction in overall system losses; (iv) improve the utilization of existing \nand planned power plants; and (v) promote further development of a national electricity market \nby connecting to the northern region grid. The total power delivery attributable to the Investment \nProgram will serve more than 12.0 million people in Uttaranchal and the northern region grid \n                                                 \n24 Projects are allocated based on potential risks and financial viability, with more commercially attractive projects \ndesignated for IPPs. A two-stage tender process is employed. Following technical prequalification, IPPs submit \nfinancial offers, with a specific bid above a predetermined floor price (cost per MW installed). The best financial \noffer is awarded the project development rights. The IPP then has an incentive to construct and commission the \nHPP as soon as possible to recover its initial investment. \n25  Interstate power sales will use the lines of the Power Grid Corporation of India, Limited, with actual trading \nmanaged by UPCL. Some augmentation of Northern Grid systems may be required to prevent bottlenecks.  \n ", "10 \nservice  area.  Parallel  efforts  by  UPCL  in  relation  to  rural  electrification  and  local  grid \nimprovements will complement ADB\u2019s intervention. \n \n36.  The 2003 Electricity Act has created an enabling environment to improve efficiency, \nsupport commercialization, and promote private sector participation. The proposed executing \nagency and implementing agencies have developed a rational sector expansion plan formulated \non a least-cost basis. PTCUL and UJVNL, both relatively new companies, have some capacity \nconstraints with respect to donor-funded project implementation (Appendix 4), therefore the \nproposed interventions include financial support for sector capacity building activities including \nGOU, UED, the state utilities, and other agencies. Related advisory TA26 will provide project \nmanagement support and build capacity in the project management office (PMO) and the \nproject implementation units (PIUs) during the first year of implementation. Additional capacity \nbuilding activities will be defined in 2006, pursuant to completion of an independent policy \nanalysis being prepared for GOU and UED. \n  \n37.  The proposed SHPP and RMU investments can be implemented independently of the \nproposed transmission subprojects, which depend on associated HPPs not financed by ADB. \nThe transmission lines, which require about 3 years to construct, must be ready for initial \noperation 6 months prior to the commissioning of the associated large HPPs, which require \nabout 5 years to construct. Based on the projected HPP commissioning schedule, the critical \ntransmission system investments will require phased construction of three groups of subprojects \nand associated HPPs. The first group of subprojects is expected to be completed within 5 years, \nthe second group is expected to be completed within 7 years, and the third group is currently \nbeing defined and also is expected to be completed with 7 years. Based on due diligence \nconducted  to  date,  the  capacity  of  UED  and  the  implementing  agencies  to  use  external \nfinancing is estimated to be on the order of $40.0 million to $60.0 million per year. This capacity, \ncombined  with  the  associated  HPP  commissioning  schedule,  indicates  that  the  proposed \nInvestment Program to be supported by ADB will require 5 to 7 years for full implementation and \nwill require flexibility in subproject selection to achieve the Program\u2019s objectives and mitigate the \noverall investment risk. The MFF modality is ideally suited to this type of investment program.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n38.  The ADB-supported subset of the Investment Program will cover the following three \nareas: \n \n  (i)   Clean  Energy  Development.  Generating  capacity  will  be  expanded  by  the \nconstruction of new SHPPs and by energy efficiency improvements at existing \ngrid-connected HPPs. Funding will also be provided for design, construction, and \ncommissioning of a hydrometeorological monitoring system to support statewide \nhydropower system operations and the planning and design of future hydropower \nexpansion.  \n  (ii)   Transmission System Expansion. Time-critical transmission lines, substations, \nand  auxiliary  equipment  will  be  constructed  to  evacuate  power  from  new \nassociated HPPs.  \n  (iii)   Capacity Building. This activity will support capacity building and strengthening \nof the institutional framework within GOU, UED, and the implementing agencies \n                                                 \n26  The TA for capacity building of the Project Management Office (ADB. 2005.

Manila), originally proposed as a TA attached to the loan, has \nbeen processed separately to accelerate project readiness. The TA was approved on 17 August 2005. ", "11 \nto undertake power system expansion activities in a cost-effective manner. It will \nfocus initially on implementation through the PMO and will include (a) training of \nUED and implementing agency staff to transfer and implement international best \npractices in transmission, generation, maintenance, and rehabilitation design and \noperations; (b) consulting services for design and construction management; (c) \nacquisition of computer hardware and software for the PMO and the PIUs; (d) \nfield supervision, including compliance with safeguards and external monitoring; \nand  (e)  corporate  development,  including  advisory  services  for  restructuring, \ninitial design of an independent power trading company, and other activities to be \ndefined in consultation between GOU, UED, and ADB. Appendix 4 presents an \ninitial summary scope of work.  \n \nC.   Technical Justification and Selection Criteria \n39.  The long-term generation and transmission expansion program for Uttaranchal has been \ndesigned based on national, regional, and state-level least-cost expansion planning led by the \nMinistry of Power, the Central Electric Authority, UED, UJVNL, PTCUL, and UPCL. The overall \nexpansion program is technically, financially, and economically viable and can be implemented \nin an environmentally friendly and socially acceptable manner. State-of-the-art technologies and \ninternational best practices will be applied to all investments, for example, upgrading from \nanalog to digital control systems, including the System Control and Automated Data Acquisition \nsystem for operations; applying global positioning and geographic information systems in route \nsurveys, planning, and design; using tunnels instead of open channel for SHPPs; and upgrading \ntechnology during RMU activities. The following are the criteria for selecting each subproject: \n \n(i)  Subprojects will be consistent with the overall least-cost expansion plan and will \nbe formulated on a least-cost basis. Subprojects will be technically feasible and \nwill  use  advanced  but  proven  technologies,  with  performance-based  design \nconsistent with international benchmarks for system efficiency and operational \nrisks. All subprojects will be economically viable and financially sustainable.  \n(ii)  Hydropower subprojects will be part of UJVNL\u2019s expansion plans, and scheduling \nfor  connection  to  the  transmission  system  will  be  coordinated  with  PTCUL. \nTransmission  subprojects  will  be  part  of  PTCUL\u2019s  expansion  plans,  and \nscheduling will be consistent with the commissioning of new generating capacity. \n(iii)  Subproject designs will be consistent with the Environmental Management Plan \n(EMP), the resettlement framework, and the indigenous peoples development \nframework  (IPDF).  Land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plans  and  indigenous \npeoples development plans based on the agreed IPDF and the resettlement \nframework will be prepared as necessary for additional subprojects prior to ADB \napproval for funding. \n(iv)  All subprojects require environmental assessments in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy 2002.27 Category A and B subprojects will require a summary \nenvironmental impact assessment (SEIA) and a summary initial environmental \nexamination  (IEE),  respectively,  to  be  prepared  and  made  available  to  the \ngeneral public 120 days before approval. EMPs with budgets will be prepared for \neach subproject. \n \n \n                                                 \n27  ADB. 2002. Environment Policy. Manila. \n ", "12 \nD.      Special Features \n1.  Carbon Emissions Trading \n \n40.  The clean energy investments may qualify for greenhouse gas emission reductions, or \ncarbon credit, trading under the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). The \nCDM is one of three flexible mechanisms28 established by the Kyoto Protocol aimed at cost-\neffectively  reducing  global  emissions  of  greenhouse  gases.  The  CDM  is  a  market-based \nfinancial instrument with the dual purpose of assisting developing nations to achieve sustainable \ndevelopment and industrial countries to meet their emission reduction targets. The CDM allows \nindustrial countries to invest in \u201cclean\u201d projects in developing countries, for example, renewable \nenergy such as hydropower, energy efficiency, and waste management, and to acquire certified \nemission reductions29\u2014generically referred to as \u201ccarbon credits\u201d\u2014that can be used to comply \nwith  the  Kyoto  Protocol.  ADB  has  provided  base  financing  for  three  CDM  projects30  with \npending carbon credit transactions, and is currently developing several more projects with CDM \npotential. ADB\u2019s CDM facility provides parallel assistance to projects that can qualify for CDM \nand to facilitate agreements between sellers, or project owners, and buyers of carbon credits.31  \n \n41.  ADB has been providing active assistance with further definition and qualification of the \npotential CDM opportunities since early 2005.32 Based on experience in neighboring Himachal \nPradesh, the SHPP subprojects are highly likely to qualify for the CDM. Based on previous \nprojects supported by ADB, the CDM-related revenue is expected to generate undiscounted \nfinancial returns of at least 10 to 15% of project costs. The CDM facility recently solicited carbon \ncredit bids for a subcomponent of the Liaoning Environment Improvement Project (see footnote \n30) of more than $10 per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent, compared with typical offers of \naround $5 per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent being offered by the World Bank\u2019s CDM funds.  \nGiven the potential financial upside, ADB is continuing to explore other opportunities for carbon \ncredit revenue in the investment program.  \n \n2.  Renewable Energy Services  \n \n42.  The Uttaranchal Renewal Energy Development Agency has requested ADB support for \na  broad  range  of  renewable  energy  development  activities,  including  commercialization  of \nbiofuel  production,  after-market  solar  energy  services,  and  mini-  and  micro-hydropower \nexpansion for rural and off-grid applications. The Global Environment Facility has responded \n                                                 \n28 The other two mechanisms are Emissions Trading and Joint Implementation. \n29 Certified emission reductions are the official commodity generated by CDM projects. One certified emission \nreduction equals 1 ton of carbon dioxide equivalent.  \n30 ADB. 2003.

The \nfirst PFR is presented to the Board, together with the FFA. The loans under the MFF will finance \ncivil works, equipment supply and erection, consulting services, and other capacity building \nactivities. The minimum amount of a loan request will be $25.0 million. All of the provisions of \nthe ordinary operations loan regulations applicable to London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased loans36 will apply to each loan, subject to any modifications that may be included under \nany loan agreement.

Summary appraisal reports will be submitted to ADB subsequent to \nUED approval and required Government clearances. The PMO will prepare progress reports \nand submit them to ADB on a quarterly basis and will submit other required performance and \nmonitoring reports twice a year.37  \n \n50.  Overall  progress  and  compliance  with  conditions  of  the  FFA  and  individual  loan \nagreements will be monitored on a regular basis with periodic reports to ADB, consistent with \nexisting  project  implementation  requirements.  Reports  will  include  evaluation  of  issues  or \nproblems  faced  by  the  executing  agencies  and  recommended  remedial  actions.  Overall \ninvestment  progress  will  be  considered  as  new  financing  requests  are  submitted.  ADB \nmanagement and staff will report regularly to ADB\u2019s Board of Directors on the implementation of \nthe MFF funded activities. Board Information Reports will be submitted on an annual basis or \nmore frequently if necessary. \n \n3.  Implementation Period \n51.  The Investment Program will be implemented over 7 years, inclusive of procurement and \nconstruction  activities,  and  will  be  completed  by  January  2013.  Each  loan  agreement  is \nexpected to have a utilization period of 5 years. The indicative implementation schedule for the \nappraised subprojects is presented in Appendix 7. \n \n4.  Procurement and Consulting Services \n52.  Equipment and materials to be financed under the loan will be procured in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. International competitive bidding will be used for civil \nworks contracts with an estimated value equivalent to or more than $10.0 million, for turnkey \ncontracts,38 and for supply contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of or more than $1.0 \nmillion. International shopping or local competitive bidding will be used for contracts estimated \nat $100,000 to $1.0 million and direct purchase will be used for contracts worth less than \n$100,000.  Contract  packages  will  be  prepared  to  ensure  maximum  competition  under \ninternational competitive bidding. Similar contractual arrangements and specifications will be \napplied to other subprojects. Indicative procurement packages are presented in Appendix 8. \nWeb-based procurement will be used to the maximum extent possible following procedures \nacceptable  to  ADB.39  Consulting  services  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants by Asian Development Bank and Its Borrowers. Services \nwill be provided through a firm or firms recruited and engaged under international competitive \nbidding procedures using the quality- and cost-based selection method and simplified technical \nproposals. For specialized tasks with a contract value less than $100,000, individual experts \nmay be recruited based on biodata submitted in response to specific terms of reference for the \nassignment. \n \n                                                 \n37 In accordance with ADB\u2019s policy on public communications (2005), project reports will be made available to the \npublic. \n38 Most proposed subprojects will utilize turnkey types of contracts. This will be the first time that PTCUL and UJVNL \nwill use turnkey procurement for SHPP, RMU, and transmission investments. \n39  UJVNL has implemented a web-based procurement system. Project Coordination and Procurement Division of the \nCentral Operations Services Office will be consulted on further e-procurement. \n ", "16 \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n53.  The  individual  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook and ADB\u2019s Interim Guidelines for Disbursement Operations, LIBOR-\nBased Loan Products, both as amended from time to time.  \n \n6.  Advanced Procurement and Retroactive Financing \n54.  Advanced procurement was approved in July 2005. Draft prequalification and bidding \ndocuments have been prepared for contract packages covering 2 clean energy subprojects and \n5 transmission subprojects. The Government has requested that retroactive financing be made \navailable for time-critical expenditures necessary to expedite subprojects implementation. ADB \nhas advised that retroactive financing of expenditures incurred from 12 months prior to signing \nthe corresponding loan agreement, with a ceiling up to 20% of the loan amount, may be \navailable for individual loans under the proposed MFF. The Government and GOU have been \ninformed that approval of advanced procurement action and retroactive financing does not \ncommit ADB to finance any of the proposed subprojects. \n \n7.  Anticorruption Policy \n55.  ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy was explained to and discussed with the Government, GOU, \nand  the  implementing  agencies.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to projects under \nthe  MFF.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy  are \nincluded in the loan regulations and the bidding documents for the Investment Program. In \nparticular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with projects under the MFF will include \nprovisions specifying ADB\u2019s right to audit and examine the records and accounts of UED and all \ncontractors, suppliers, and consultants and other service providers as they relate to the projects \nunder the MFF.  \n \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n56.  Quarterly progress reports will be prepared for the individual loans and subprojects for \nsubmittal to ADB. The reports will include a description of physical progress, problems, and \ndifficulties  encountered  and  a  summary  of  financial  accounts  that  will  consist  of  loan \nexpenditures during the period, year to date, and total to date. A project completion report will \nbe  submitted  within  3  months  following  completion  of  each  loan.  PTCUL  and  UJVNL  will \nmaintain separate accounts for each loan. Within 6 months of the close of the financial year, \nUED,  PTCUL,  and  UJVNL  will  submit  annual  pro  forma  project  accounts  and  un-audited \nfinancial statements for UED and the implementing agencies, and will submit audited accounts \nand financial statements within 9 months of the close of the financial year. PTCUL and UJVNL \nwill continue the practice of hiring independent auditors to audit their annual financial statements \nand annual project accounts on a schedule to be agreed by the Government and ADB. The \nauditors will submit their report together with the respective annual financial statements and \nannual project accounts reports.  \n \n9.  Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n57.  The PMO, with inputs from PTCUL, UJVNL, and UED, will prepare quarterly progress \nreports and submit these to ADB within 45 days of the end of each quarter. These reports will ", "17 \nprovide (i) a narrative description of progress made during the period, (ii) changes in the \nimplementation schedule, (iii) problems or difficulties encountered, and (iv) work to be carried \nout in the next period. The progress reports will also include a summary financial account for \nthe project components, including subprojects, consisting of project expenditures during the \nperiod, total expenditure to date, and benefit monitoring in accordance with procedures and \ndetails acceptable to ADB. Performance will be evaluated on the basis of indicators and \ntargets stipulated in the design and monitoring framework. The ADB project team will prepare \nperiodic reports to inform the ADB Board of Directors of overall progress.  A Board information \nreport will be submitted annually, and supplemental progress reports will be submitted prior to \nmanagement approval of individual loan agreements. \n \n10.  Review \n58.  ADB will field an inception mission within 3 months of the first loan approval. ADB will \nreview the implementation and operations based on quarterly progress reports and meet with \nUED and the Government semiannually to discuss implementation progress. A midterm review \nto be carried out 2 years after loan effectiveness will focus on the engineering, resettlement, and \nenvironmental aspects of the ADB-supported investments and review the financial status of \nPTCUL and UJVNL. Representatives of ADB, UED, and the implementing agencies will take \npart in the review. The review will allow for any necessary midcourse corrections to ensure \nsuccessful implementation and achievement of objectives. A project completion report will be \nsubmitted within 3 months following completion of the individual loans. A facility completion \nreport will be prepared after the completion of all ADB-supported activities and subprojects. \n \nIV.  BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n59.  Candidate subprojects that have been appraised by ADB and GOU include new SHPPs, \nRMU  of  existing  HPPs,  a  hydrometeorological  monitoring  system  to  support  generation \noperations, and new transmission lines and substations to evacuate power from five new HPPs. \nThe candidate generation and transmission subprojects are presented in Appendix 2, Table \nA2.4. Indicative cost estimates for the appraised subprojects are presented in Appendix 5. \n \n60.  Capacity  building  activities  will  be  implemented  as  separate  subprojects.  The  initial \nsubproject will cover consulting services for design, procurement, construction management, \nand  implementation  of  environmental  and  social  safeguards  (see  Appendix  4).  Additional \nsubprojects for corporate development, incorporation of a power trading company, and other \nsector reforms will be defined in consultation between ADB, GOU, and UED.   \n \n61.  The financial analyses were carried out on an individual subproject basis, whereas \neconomic  analysis  was  conducted  using  an  integrated,  macro  time-slice  approach.  The \nproposed investment is based on a least-cost expansion plan for generation and transmission.  \n \nA.  Financial Analysis \n \n62.  The  institutional  and  subproject  financial  evaluations  have  been  carried  out  in \naccordance with the Guidelines for the Financial Governance and Management of Investment \nProjects  Financed  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank.  The  analyses  cover  the  period  from \nFY2005\u20132006 to FY2025\u20132026. Financial viability was examined by comparing the incremental \ncosts and benefits under with and without investment scenarios in real terms using constant \nFY2004\u20132005 prices. In calculating the forecast energy tariffs and wheeling charges for the \n ", "18 \ndifferent project components, UERC regulations40 on tariff determination for energy generation \nand transmission services were applied as appropriate. UERC\u2019s regulations are modeled on the \nCentral  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission\u2019s  regulations,  which  allow  for  full  cost  recovery, \nincluding capital costs (at a debt to equity ratio of up to 70:30), depreciation, 14% return on \nequity, and interest at actual cost. Operating costs are fully recoverable for prudent levels of \nexpenditures  and  are  generally  based  on  accepted  benchmark  allowances  or  historical \nperformance. There is also potential for higher returns from generation under Ministry of Power \nrules that permit 15% or more of UJVNL\u2019s production to be sold on the open market, where \npeak supplies command a premium. The financial internal rates of return (FIRRs) for clean \nenergy and transmission investments were calculated on an after tax basis and indicate that the \ncore  subprojects  are  financially  viable.  The  resulting  FIRRs  compare  favorably  with  the \nweighted average cost of capital of 4.36%. The FIRR for clean energy subprojects is 4.8%, and \nfor transmission subprojects is 7.4%. The detailed projected financial performance for each \ncompany is presented in Appendix 9. A summary of financial analyses, including sensitivity \nanalyses and risk assessment, is presented in Appendix 10 and Supplementary Appendix B.  \n \nB.  Economic Analysis \n \n63.  The economic analysis reviews power sector policies, demand and supply forecasts, \nand least-cost system planning methodologies and includes a cost-benefit study. The demand \nand supply review shows that India in general, and the Northern Region in particular, suffer from \nchronic  supply  shortages  and  that  the  project  investments  are  justified  based  on  forecast \ndemand and supply considerations. The Investment Program will partly generate benefits in the \nform of resource cost saving by displacing investments in coal-fired and gas-fired power plants \nand will partly meet incremental demands for electric power. Cost-benefit analysis shows that \nhydropower  is  cheaper  than  the  displaced  thermal  power  and  that  the  advantage  is \nstrengthened when the environmental benefits of avoided carbon dioxide emissions are taken \ninto account. The benefits of the incremental consumption were estimated by developing a \ndemand function for the household sector that calculates domestic consumers\u2019 willingness to \npay for incremental supply and by assuming that for other consumer categories, the tariff is a \nconservative proxy for their willingness to pay. The economic cost-benefit analysis results in an \neconomic internal rate of return of 21% for the base case, and when environmental benefits are \nadded increases to 28%. The sensitivity analyses show that the Investment Program remains \njustified should various risks materialize, but is sensitive to reductions in demand. However, low \ndemand is considered a relatively small risk given India\u2019s long history of unmet demand. The \ndetailed analysis is provided in Appendix 11. \n \nC.  Social Aspects \n \n64.  Based on the findings of an initial poverty reduction and social assessment, a summary \npoverty  reduction  and  social  strategy  was  developed.  During  Investment  Program  design, \nparticipatory  approaches  were  undertaken,  including  consultations  with  representatives  of \ncommunities, local governments, and other stakeholders. A summary poverty reduction and \nsocial strategy is presented in Appendix 12. \n \n65.  Appraised Subprojects. A full Resettlement Plan was prepared for the first and second \ngroups  of  subprojects  appraised  by  ADB  and  GOU  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on \nInvoluntary Resettlement. Entitlements in the Resettlement Plan are consistent with those in the \n                                                 \n40 Uttaranchal Electricity Regulatory Commission Regulations. 2004. Terms and Conditions for Determination of \nHydro Generation Tariff and Terms and Conditions for Determination of Transmission Tariff.  India. ", "19 \nentitlement matrix of the summary resettlement framework (Appendix 13). According to the \nResettlement Plan, the expansion of transmission systems will require 8.03 hectares (ha) of \npermanent land acquisition and 179.21 ha of temporary acquisition from private owners.41 In \naddition, 16.03 ha of public land will also be acquired. SHPPs will require 3.12 ha of permanent \nacquisition from private owners and no temporary acquisition plus 10.87 ha of public land. RMU \nand  institutional  strengthening  will  not  involve  land  acquisition  and  resettlement.  Land \nacquisition and resettlement resulting from core subprojects will affect 25 households on a \npermanent basis and 229 on a temporary basis. None of the components will involve any loss of \nstructures. \n \n66.  The Resettlement Plan provides details on the impacts of appraised subprojects. All \naffected people will be provided with compensation and resettlement assistance if their land is \npermanently or temporarily acquired;42 their income sources are adversely affected; and their \ncrops, trees, and other facilities or access to properties are damaged or reduced because of the \nSubprojects. A lack of legal documents pertaining to their customary rights of occupancy or of \ntitles does not affect affected people\u2019s eligibility for compensation. In addition to compensation \npayments in accordance with the Land Acquisition Act, those affected will receive additional \nassistance to match replacement costs for lost land; the transaction costs, including stamps and \nregistration  costs,  for  the  purchase  of  replacement  land;  and  other  forms  of  resettlement \nassistance,  such  as  transition  allowances  and  agricultural  inputs  for  reestablishing  crops. \nLosses  of  profits  and  income  because  of  property  losses  or  loss  of  access  to  property, \nregardless of whether or not the affected person has title to the land, will be compensated. To \nrestore income losses, compensation for lost workdays and/or income and training will be \nprovided to affected people. Short-term training will be provided by engaging non-government \nagencies where feasible. \n \n67.  Detailed field work to assess the socioeconomic profile of affected people did not find \nscheduled tribes or indigenous people in the subproject areas, thus the Investment Program is \nnot  expected  to  affect  indigenous  people  negatively  or  differentially.  Socioeconomic  data \nindicate the presence of vulnerable groups, and provisions to address impacts on these groups \nhave been made in the Resettlement Plan and resettlement framework. Special assistance to \nvulnerable  groups  includes  prioritization  in  land-for-land  compensation  schemes;  additional \nallowances for house reconstruction, relocation, and income losses; specialized training; and \npriority for employment in subproject activities. \n \n68.  Other Subprojects. A resettlement framework and an IPDF were prepared and will \nserve  as  a  basis  for  preparing  subsequent  resettlement  plans  and  IPDFs  for  additional \nsubprojects as required. All plans will be prepared in full consultation with affected people and \nwill be disclosed to them in draft form. The resettlement framework and IPDF will be placed on \nADBs web site. \n \nD.  Poverty Analysis \n \n69.  Uttaranchal is one of India\u2019s poorest states. In 2002, the per capita net state domestic \nproduct was Rs13,000, compared with the national average of Rs18,000. A recent survey found \n                                                 \n41 Of 179 ha temporarily acquired, owners will be compensated for lost agricultural income for an estimated 115 ha of \nagricultural land. \n42  Temporary acquisition for the storage of construction materials and equipment for substations, SHPPs, and RMU \nin relation to core subprojects will involve government land. For temporary acquisition of private agricultural land, \naffected persons will be provided compensation for lost agricultural income. \n ", "20 \nthat  36%  of  rural  families  in  Uttaranchal  are  below  the  poverty  line.  Poverty  is  unevenly \ndistributed throughout the state, with pockets of extreme poverty located in interior rural areas. \n \n70.  The Investment Program is expected to result in more efficient and reliable delivery of \nelectric services. Poor and vulnerable consumers, including hospitals, schools, and other social \nutilities, which are often hardest hit by inadequate power supply, load shedding, and poor power \nquality, will benefit directly from the investments. Direct positive economic and social benefits \nwill result from the subprojects. Power generated by SHPPs will be connected to the local grid \nat 33 kV, increasing local grid capacity and bringing the benefits of electricity, which include \nbetter health care, sanitation, education, greater income-earning opportunities, and higher living \nstandards,  to  remote  communities.  RMU  activities  will  provide  more  reliable  power  to  the \nexisting grid.  \n \n71.  The Investment Program is expected to create new full-time employment opportunities. \nFor civil works in relation to SHPP and RMU investments, 160 and 240 unskilled workers, \nrespectively, will be hired for a period of 3 years. For the civil works related to transmission \nlines, about 650 unskilled local workers will be hired for a period of 18 months. Improved power \nsupplies will induce light industrial and commercial activity, creating employment opportunities \nand improving productivity and the quality of outputs in the  manufacturing and agriculture \nsectors. Indirect positive impacts will result from exports of power to the northern region grid, \nallowing GOU to generate income that can be targeted specifically for social development in the \nstate, particularly for the poor. \n \nE.  Environmental Assessment \n \n72.  The SHPPs are classified as Category A,43 the transmission subprojects are classified \nas  Category  B,  and  the  RMU  and  hydrology  subprojects  are  classified  as  Category  C. \nConsidering  the  potential  cumulative  impacts  of  the  overall  generation  and  transmission \nexpansion program, including associated HPPs not financed by ADB, the Investment Program \nhas  been  assigned  Category  A  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  2002  (see \nfootnote 27). Environmental impact assessments were prepared for the SHPPs and an IEE was \nprepared  for  the  transmission  lines  and  substations.  An  SEIA,  including  an  environmental \nassessment and review framework, and an EMP (with budget) were prepared based on the \nenvironmental impact assessments and IEE. Two rounds of public consultation were conducted \nthat indicated broad support for the Project based on expected economic and social benefits. \nThe SEIA was circulated to ADB\u2019s Board on 20 May 2005 and was translated and made \navailable to affected people in the project area. An environmental sector assessment was \nsubmitted to ADB on 17 June 2005. The findings and conclusions of the sector assessment are \nconsistent with the SEIA, namely, the investment benefits far outweigh negative impacts and the \nnegative impacts can be mitigated in a cost-effective manner. Four broad alternatives have \nbeen  considered:  (i)  no  action,  that  is,  importing  power  from  the  northern  region  grid;  (ii) \nexpansion  of  coal-fired  power  in  the  eastern  region,  coupled  with  interstate  transmission \nexpansion to wheel power to the northern region grid; (iii) construction of a relatively small \nnumber of large storage dams in Uttaranchal; and (iv) relatively smaller run-of-river plants as in \nthe proposed integrated generation and transmission expansion program. Alternative (iv) is \npreferred on the basis of national policy, economic analysis, environmental and social costs, \nand gestation period.44   \n                                                 \n43 Taken in isolation, the individual SHPPs could be assigned environment Category B.  \n44 Given the 25-year gestation period of the Tehri dam project, GOU adopted an informal policy of avoiding large \nstorage dams in favor of run-of-river designs.  ", "21 \n73.  Based on the environmental assessments and reconnaissance surveys, most of the \nimpacts will occur during construction. The SHPPs use trench weirs instead of dams, a design \nfeature that ensures the maintenance of minimum river flow. The rivers are non-navigable, no \ncommercial or subsistence fisheries are located in the investment program area, and rural and \nvillage  water  use  will  not  be  affected.  The  principal  impacts  are  clearance  of  vegetation, \nmanagement of excavation soil and rock, and reduction in water flow in short sections of small \nrivers. These impacts will be mitigated by appropriate erosion control measures, re-use of \nexcavation wastes wherever possible, controlled disposal of residual excavation wastes, and \nprovision of compensation for reforestation at a ratio of 2 ha of forest land for each hectare \ntaken by the subprojects. No endangered, rare, or threatened species of flora or fauna have \nbeen  reported  at  any  subproject  sites.  Adequate  provisions  have  been  made  for  the \nenvironmental  mitigation  and  monitoring  requirements  and  their  associated  costs.  The \nInvestment Program will have a small \u201cfootprint\u201d: the maximum amount of land directly affected \nby all subproject components is less than 12 square kilometers out of a total program area \nlarger than 51,000 square kilometers. The subproject sites are located mostly on land owned by \nGOU. The land acquired for new substations is mostly uninhabited and unused land located \noutside towns and villages. Mitigation measures related to construction and specified in the \nEMP  will  be  incorporated  into  civil  works  contracts.  Implementation  of  mitigation  during \nconstruction will be primarily a responsibility of the contractors, but the implementing agencies \nwill be responsible for overall implementation of site-specific EMPs. \n \n74.  The overall objective of expanding clean energy capacity will generate local, regional, \nand global environmental benefits. Local air quality, particularly indoor air quality, will improve \nbecause of the substitution of electricity for biomass (animal dung and wood) and kerosene. \nRegional air quality will be preserved by offsetting the expansion of thermal generating capacity. \nGlobal greenhouse gas reductions will also accrue by offsetting increases in thermal power \ncapacity.45 \n \nF.  Potential Risks \n \n75.  Risks include (i) tariffs set below cost-recovery levels, rendering the subprojects and the \nInvestment  Program  financially  nonviable;  (ii)  delays  in  power  sector  reforms;  (iii)  delays  in \nregulatory approvals for transmission line rights-of-way; (iv) delays in construction of associated \nHPPs not financed by ADB; (v) increases in the prices of cement, steel, and other raw materials \nthat would render the investments financially nonviable; (vi) failure to mobilize the necessary \ncounterpart funds; and (vii) delays in procurement and contract awards. All these risks are low or \nhave  been  minimized  to  the  extent  possible  in  that  tariff  setting  on  new  plants  employs  a \ntransparent formula based on cost of supply principles, GOU is committed to ongoing sector \nreforms,  regulatory  approval  for  rights-of-way  is  in  progress,  approximately  half  of  the  key \nassociated HPPs are at an advanced design stage or are under construction, raw material prices \nare expected to stabilize or decrease during the implementation period, and GOU has confirmed \nthat counterpart funds will be available.   \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n76.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  GOU  have  given  the \nfollowing  assurances,  which  have  largely  been  incorporated  in  the  Framework  Financing \nAgreement, and will be incorporated in the individual loan agreement and project agreement(s) \n                                                 \n45  As noted in para. 41 the SHPPs are expected to qualify for emissions trading under the CDM. \n ", "22 \nas applicable and mutually agreed between the Government and ADB for each Project under \nthe MFF.  \n \n77.  Sector  Reforms.  GOU  will  ensure  that  its  three  power  utility  companies\u2014UJVNL, \nPTCUL and UPCL\u2014will conform to the tariff orders issued from time to time by UERC to ensure \nreduced T&D losses, rational power pricing, and graduated increase in tariffs as determined by \nUERC. PTCUL and UJVNL will file tariff applications with UERC in a timely manner. The \nGovernment and GOU will continue to emphasize and support the autonomy of PTCUL, UJVNL, \nand UPCL with respect to commercial, administrative, and operational activities. As required by \nthe Government, GOU will enact fiscal responsibility and budget management legislation to \neliminate its revenue deficit by FY2008. GOU will appoint two additional members to UERC as \nplanned by the end of 2006. PTCUL will appoint at least two independent directors by the end of \n2007. \n \n78.  Management  and  Implementation.  PTCUL  and  UJVNL  will  be  responsible  for \nplanning,  design,  and  procurement.  The  PMO  will  have  primary  responsibility  for  program \ncoordination.  UED,  PTCUL,  and  UJVNL  will  ensure  timely  and  adequate  provision  of \ncounterpart funds.  \n \n79.  Financial Governance. In accordance with tariff orders issued by UERC, GOU through \nUED  shall  ensure  that  PTCUL  and  UJVNL  maintain  the  following  financial  management \nobjectives from FY2006\u20132007:  \n \n(i)  debt-service coverage ratio of not less than 1.2, and \n(ii)  accounts receivable of no more than 2 months of billing. \n \n80.  Financial Management. Internal controls will be strengthened to be consistent with \ninternational standards by setting up and maintaining independent and autonomous internal \naudit  departments  in  the  implementing  agencies.  The  implementing  agencies  will  adopt \ncomputerized accounting and management information systems, including online billing and \ncollection systems, where appropriate and practical, by the end of 2007. \n \n81.  Environmental. GOU through UED will ensure that PTCUL and UJVNL will ensure that \nthe proposed investments under the MFF are undertaken and that all subproject facilities are \noperated and maintained in accordance with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations of the \nGovernment and ADB\u2019s Environment Policy 2002 (footnote 27), as amended from time to time. \nFor  each  subproject,  PTCUL  and  UJVNL  will  prepare  and  implement  the  necessary  IEE, \nenvironmental  impact  assessment,  and  EMP  (with  budget)  in  accordance  with  the \nenvironmental assessment and review framework. For subprojects not defined prior to approval \nof  the  MFF,  the  environmental  categorization  and  assessment  procedures  defined  in  the \nenvironmental  assessment  and  review  framework  will  be  followed  as  part  of  subproject \nappraisal. For any category A or B subprojects, an SEIA or IEE will be prepared and made \navailable  to  the  public  120  days  in  advance  of  subproject  approval  following  ADB \nimplementation procedures for sector loans. PTCUL and UJVNL will monitor, audit, and report \nto ADB twice a year on the implementation of the EMPs for each subproject.

Northern Region Supply and Demand Scenario \n \n1.  The persistent power shortage in the northern region can theoretically be made up with \nimports from the eastern and northeastern regions (Table A2.1). However, several constraints \nand issues impede such imports, namely: (i) the eastern region surplus depends on coal-fired \ngeneration, which is not favored by current national policy; (ii) the projected northeastern region \nsurplus  depends  on large  hydropower  plants (HPPs)  that  have  yet  to  be  constructed;  (iii) \ninterstate transmission capacity must be expanded to eliminate bottlenecks at the \u201cchicken\u2019s \nneck\u201d in West Bengal; and (iv) overall transmission capacity must be constructed to wheel the \nexpected surpluses between regions.1 Given these constraints, the projected northern region \ndeficit can readily be met by expanding Uttaranchal\u2019s hydropower capacity. \n \nTable A2.1: Load Generation Scenario, Early 11th Plan (2008\u20132009)  \n(megawatts) \n    Peak  Peak  Surplus/ \nRegion  Installed Capacity  Demand  Availability  (Deficit) \nNorthern  44,300  41,200  33,200   (8,000) \nWestern  44,500  41,000  33,000  (8,000) \nSouthern  37,000  35,000  31,000  (4,000) \nEastern  27,000  13,500  24,000  10,500 \nNortheastern  6,300  1,500  4,500  3,000 \n   Total  158,100  132,200  124,700  (7,500) \n        Source:  Power Grid Corporation of India, Limited. \n \nB.  Performance of the Power Sector in Uttaranchal State \n2.  The Uttaranchal power sector has shown strengths in terms of reducing cross-subsidies \nacross customer categories, implementing merit order dispatch principles, rationalizing tariff \nslabs, and completing interface metering, weaknesses have overshadowed strengths especially \nin terms of (i) high aggregate technical and commercial losses (44% in 2003-04); and (ii) no \nsignificant capacity additions to date. The government of Uttaranchal is obligated to formulate a \nfinancial restructuring plan for securing financial restructuring support that is based on meeting \nloss reduction targets across the state.  \n \n3.  Uttaranchal\u2019s separation from Uttar Pradesh provided some immediate benefits to the \nstate, for example, segregating the state\u2019s grid operations translated into lower overall demand \non the Uttaranchal grid, and thus annual aggregate power availability effectively increased \n(though seasonal shortages still occur). A key positive operational parameter has been the \nrecent performance of Uttaranchal Jal Vidyut Nigam, Limited\u2019s HPPs, with a high availability \nfactor and the ability to keep auxiliary consumption within normative levels. The financial risk of \nthe utilities was rated low: Uttaranchal Power Corporation, Limited (UPCL) has been regular in \nits debt servicing to lenders and earned cash profits in fiscal year (FY) 2001 and FY2002. For \nFY2003, the coverage of cash costs was high at 85%. However, collection efficiency is an area \nwith scope for improvement.2  \n                                                 \n1 The Asian Development Bank is supporting the expansion of interstate transmission capacity via loans to the \nPowergrid Corporation of India, Limited. \n2  The Uttaranchal Electricity Regulatory Commission has identified universal metering in the three principal urban \nload centers as a priority for meeting revenue targets. \n ", "30  Appendix 2 \nC.  Generation Potential and Expansion Plans in Uttaranchal \n \n4.  Uttaranchal is currently a net importer of electric power, but generates a seasonal surplus \nand plans to become a net exporter of power by 2010 by expanding its hydropower and high-\nvoltage transmission capacity. Total capacity expansion of 10,000 megawatts (MW) is planned \nthrough 2018. Currently 14 projects totaling 5,525 MW are under construction3 and expected to \nbe commissioned by 2010. An additional 4,791 MW are under development, with expected \ncommissioning dates after 2010, and another 9,090 MW are planned. Figure A2.1 shows the \nprojected annual and cumulative capacity additions from 2005 through 2018. \n \nFigure A2.1: Planned Hydropower Capacity Additions Through 2018 \n12,000\n10,000\n8,000\nt\nat\nw\na 6,000\ng\ne\nm\n4,000\n2,000\nAnnual Capacity \nCumulative 0\nCapacity\n5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n \n       \n       Source: Uttaranchal Jal Vidyut Nigam, Limited  \n \n \nD.  Transmission System Expansion \n5.  The  transmission  system  within  Uttaranchal  is  the  responsibility  of  the  Power \nTransmission Corporation of Uttaranchal, Limited (PTCUL), which provides open access to its \nfacilities on terms that are subject to tariff orders issued by the Uttaranchal Electricity Regulatory \nCommission. PTCUL was formed by separating UPCL\u2019s transmission assets and undertakings \nand commenced operations on 1 June 2004. The major challenges facing PTCUL are building \nand operating a network to cope with a fourfold increase in energy transfers within its first 10 \nyears of operation and building the human resource capacity to sustain corporate operations. \nThe proposed investment support from the Asian Development Bank will be critical to this goal. \n \n6.  The  integrated  transmission  system  for  Uttaranchal  is  intended  to  provide  for  the \nevacuation of new HPP capacity in the state\u2019s four major river basins. The load flow studies \n                                                 \n3  This figure includes the Tehri and Koteshwar projects, totaling 2,400 MW, which will transmit power directly to the \nnorthern region grid in Uttar Pradesh. These HPPs are not included in the proposed Investment Program. ", "  Appendix 2  31 \nused to develop PTCUL\u2019s transmission system have been prepared by the Central Electricity \nAuthority and assume that the beneficiary of the state\u2019s generation will be the northern region. \nThe studies have estimated requirements needed to meet peak conditions in the northern \nregion and therefore allow for the evacuation of electric power from the planned new generation \ncapacities.  \n \nE.  Distribution Operations \n \n7.  UPCL is the sole distribution licensee in Uttaranchal. A key challenge is the high level of \naggregate technical and commercial losses, which increased during the first 3 years of its \noperations. However, the trend has been reversing in FY2005. Commercial losses increased \nfrom  Rs981.1  million  in  FY2002  to  Rs2,049.5  million  in  FY2003  with  transmission  and \ndistribution losses estimated at 35%. Nevertheless, UPCL\u2019s overall financial position during the \n3-year period ending FY2004 has been reasonably robust because of its high financial margins: \nUPCL has been able to generate and/or purchase power an average rate of about Re1 per \nkilowatt-hour while charging consumers at an average rate of Rs2.50 per kilowatt-hour. At the \nsame time, since the creation of the state and the establishment of state-level grid operations, \noverall  end-user  tariffs  have  decreased  (Table  A2.2),  load  shedding  has  decreased,  and \nconsumer  satisfaction  has  improved.  Pursuant  to  tariff  orders  issued  by  the  Uttaranchal \nElectricity Regulatory Commission, UPCL has initiated systematic efforts to reduce losses, \naddressing both technical and nontechnical losses.  \n \nTable A2.2: Uttaranchal Tariffs by Consumer Category  \n(Rs/kilowatt-hour) \n  Before the Creation of the  After the Creation of the \n  State Electric Regulatory  State Electric Regulatory \nCategory  Commission, FY2002    Commission, FY2005  \nDomestic  2.05  1.93 \nNondomestic (commercial)  4.96  3.21 \nPrivate Tube Wells   0.80  1.52 \nIndustry  4.44  3.03 \n           Source: Uttaranchal Electricity Regulatory Commission \n \nF.  Sector Sustainability and Road Map \n \n8.  Uttaranchal is at a fairly advanced stage of sector reforms and is now in a period of \ngestation, absorbing the impacts of a newly regulated market. At least two factors bode well for \nfuture sustainability: (i) the state has a low proportion of agricultural consumers (which account \nfor less than 10% of overall electricity consumption), and (ii) the government of Uttaranchal has \nacknowledged that electricity is not a free good. The state-level policies and sector development \nplans are well defined and the utilities are initiating new management and human resources \ndevelopment strategies. Given the large capital requirements for the sector expansion, external \nfinancing is appropriate. The state-level road map for the power sector is presented in Table \nA2.3. The generation and transmission Investment Program is presented in Table A2.4, with \nsubprojects proposed for ADB support highlighted. \n \n ", "  3\n2\n \n \nA\nTable A2.3:  Power Sector Road Map  p\np\ne\nPreparatory Phase: 1998\u20132004  Intermediate Phase: 2004\u20132012  n\nd\nLegislation and Regulation  Anticipated Regulatory Changes   ix\n 2\n1995: Grid code established and notified.

The  government  of  Uttaranchal  (GOU)  has  taken  a  strong  leadership  position  on \neconomic development, with power system expansion and tourism development identified as \nthe pillars of economic growth. Subsequent to policy and legislative reforms, the Uttaranchal \npower sector is rapidly evolving from a system of regulated monopolies toward a competitive \nmarket.  Achieving  the  policy  and  sector  objectives  by  2012  requires  a  rapid  upgrade  in \ninstitutional capability to manage change as well as simultaneously manage construction of \nseveral large-scale power infrastructure projects. GOU and the state-owned utilities recognize \nthe need to (i) expand its knowledge and human resource base to accelerate power sector \ndevelopment,  (ii)  continue  corporate  restructuring  of  utility  companies,  (iii)  broaden  its \nprocurement  and  contracting  modalities,  and  (iv)  effectively  manage  externally  funded \ninvestments. The implementing agencies have a substantial endowment of human capital in the \nform of senior technical staff in the UED (UED) and the implementing agencies, but at the same \ntime, the capacity to implement donor-funded investments is limited. The state has had little \nfinancial  support  from  external  donors,  which  has  been  limited  primarily  to  grant-funded \ntechnical  assistance.  UED  had  some  experience  with  donor-funded  projects  prior  to \nUttaranchal\u2019s separation from Uttar Pradesh, but has no experience with implementing Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  loans.  Likewise,  two  of  the  implementing  agencies  (Power \nTransmission Corporation of Uttaranchal, Limited [PTCUL] and Uttaranchal Jal Vidyut Nigam, \nLimited [UJVNL]) are relatively new companies and have no experience with implementing ADB \nor other donor loans. The state has limited recent experience with large infrastructure projects, \nand therefore limited adoption of state-of-the-art technologies in design and execution. Many \nsenior technical staff are nearing retirement age, giving rise to an urgent need to develop the \nnext generation of managerial and technical staff, especially in the implementing agencies. On \nbalance, capacity building is needed in UED and the implementing agencies to sustain its power \nsector investment program, as well as to implement the proposed ADB-supported investments. \n \n2.  PTCUL and UJVNL are at an early stage of familiarization with ADB\u2019s policies and \nprocedures.  Therefore  relevant  staff  need  to  be  designated  for  training  and  additional \nexperienced and qualified staff need to be recruited for implementation. The lack of capacity to \nabsorb and appropriately manage the large amount of funds must also be addressed for both \ncompanies. The appropriate mechanism for efficient implementation is a well-functioning Project \nManagement  Office  (PMO).  The  structure  and  functions  of  the  proposed  PMO  are  at  an \nadvanced stage of definition and development and encompass the duties, responsibilities, lines \nof supervision, and limits of authority for all officers, managers, and other staff. Limits on staff \nrotation will ultimately be established to discourage excessive turnover and a deterioration of the \nPMO\u2019s effectiveness. Complementing the investment subprojects, capacity building will initially \ncover  program  implementation  support  and  corporate  development.1  Preliminary  indicative \nbudgets are shown in Appendix 5.  \n \nA.  Implementation Support \n3.  Implementation support includes (i) the consulting services required for the design and \nconstruction  of  transmission  lines,  substations,  small  hydropower  plants,  and  renovation, \nmonitoring, and upgrade; (ii) the preparation of subproject appraisal reports for the candidate \n(noncore) subprojects; (iii) the implementation of management plans for environmental and \nsocial  safeguards,  including  the  preparation  of  environmental  and  social  assessments  for \n                                                 \n1  Additional capacity building activities will be defined after completion of a policy analysis study, expected by March \n2006.  ", "  Appendix 4  39 \nsubprojects introduced after the approval of the multitranche financing facility (MFF); and (iv) the \nacquisition and installation of project-related information technology. The consultants will also \ncoordinate training programs and provide appropriate on-the-job training. The total estimated \ntime for international consulting services is about 110 person-months over 4 years. The total \nestimated time for all consulting services is about 220 person-months. \n \n1.

Financial Management Issues \n \n1.  The financial management of Uttaranchal Jal Vidyut Nigam, Limited (UJVNL) and the \nPower Transmission Corporation of Uttaranchal, Limited (PTCUL) was reviewed and found to \nbe adequate. Progress on strengthening corporate governance and financial management is \nunder  way:  an  independent  audit  committee,  external  directors,  and  open  recruitment  of \nmanagers and other staff and other human resources policies are being actively undertaken. As \nthe newer organization, PTCUL is still in the early stages of establishing its human resource \nprocesses and management systems. Both companies are excessively reliant on deputed1 staff \nand need to strengthen their human resource programs and finalize their long-term staffing \nplans. Another issue common to both entities is the need to identify and value the assets that \nwere  allocated  to  the companies  during  the unbundling process.  PTCUL  in  particular  was \nallocated  a  large  inventory  of  spare  parts  and  materials  and  accounts  receivable  of \nindeterminate value. The companies\u2019 sponsors need to accept some write-off of obsolete stock \nand uncollectible receivables so that financial reports can be finalized. \n \n2.  The 1956 Companies Act, the Income Tax Act, and the 2003 Electricity Act govern \naccounting and reporting requirements for both companies. Financial reporting is conducted on \nan accrual basis, with financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting standards \nissued each year by the Institute of Chartered Accountant of India. Proper accounting policies \nand procedures are in place for UJVNL and PTCUL, but reporting is slow and needs to be \nimproved,  for  example,  UJVNL\u2019s  latest  audited  financial  statements  are  for  FY2002.  Both \ncompanies  have  failed  to  meet  deadlines  for  regulatory  submissions.  The  adoption  of \ncomputerized accounting and management information systems under the MFF would help \novercome the current slow and inefficient flow of information.  \n \n3.  Internal auditors for both UJVNL and PTCUL  report to their respective directors of \nfinance, which reduces the internal auditors\u2019 independence and threatens the integrity and \ncreditability of their functions. A more independent and autonomous internal audit department is \nrecommended, with auditors reporting directly to their respective boards of directors rather than \nto the managers of the firms\u2019 finances. \n \n4.  UJVNL  is  able  to  obtain  some  funding  from  various  state  and  central  government \nschemes, for example, financing under the Accelerated Generation and Supply Program and \nequity infusions from the state government. Given its large capital expenditure plan and the \ncurrent interest in hydropower, UJVNL could conceivably tap private sources of funds to help \nfinance its investment program. However, vigilance is required to ensure that the company\u2019s \ncapital investments are technically sound and commercially viable. In some cases, technical \nand financial evaluations are outsourced to external agencies to ensure high standards of \ninvestment evaluation. To strengthen its future corporate strategy and vision, UJVNL is in the \nprocess of finalizing the selection of external consultants to help develop a comprehensive \nbusiness plan and sound financial risk management policies and practices. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1 Deputed staff are those employees \u201con loan\u201d from other organizations, but whose salaries are paid by the  \n\u201cborrowing\u201d company. ", "  Appendix 9  47 \nB.  Uttaranchal Jal Vidyut Nigam Limited  \n \n  1.   Financial Performance \n \n5.  UJVNL was formed in 2001, shortly after the creation of the state of Uttaranchal. UJVNL \nwas created by separating the assets of Uttar Pradesh Jal Vidyut Nigam, Limited based on \nlocation.  As  a  result,  UJVNL  received  9  large  and  medium  hydropower  plants,  9  small \nhydropower plants, and 23 microhydro stations with total capacity of 1,130.00 megawatts (MW), \nof which 1,005MW are operated by UJVNL, 5MW by an independent power producer, and the \nbalance of 120MW by the National Hydroelectric Power Corporation, Limited. \n  \n6.  UJVNL is in the process of initiating a range of new projects that complement the \ninvestments of the central public sector utilities by increasing its supply capacity from 1,130 MW \nto more than 3,000 MW. The new projects will enable UJVNL to meet local demand in the near \nterm and are expected to allow it to sell power outside the state and thereby improve returns, \nparticularly through the sale of peaking power capacity.2 The largest of the major projects (Pala \nManeri) is now in the early stages of implementation and will provide 480 MW from 2011. \nManeri Bhali-II (304 MW), which is due to be completed in 2006, will generate significant \nadditional income for the company. The other large hydroelectric power plants in the program \nare scheduled to start construction over the next 2 to 3 years.  \n \n7.  Large capital investments will catalyze and sustain long-term economic growth in the \nstate. The financial analysis indicates that the overall program is financially viable provided that \nUJVNL secures sufficient long-term funds to carry out the slated capital expansion program over \na short time span. However, UJVNL will need to carefully manage its expenditures and finances \nto avoid commitments that unduly stretch its debt-service capacity and/or test the regulator\u2019s \nwillingness to raise generation tariffs to a level that covers capital costs. The analysis assumes \nthat the Uttaranchal Electricity Regulatory Commission (UERC) will increase tariffs to cost-\ncovering  levels  in  accordance  with  UERC  and  Central  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission \nguidelines; that the overall investment program will be staggered; and that UJVNL will maintain \na minimum capability for projected debt service, that is, a debt-service coverage ratio of 1.2. \nFigures for FY2001\u2013FY2004 are based on actual figures provided by UJVNL, whereas the \nprojections for FY2005\u2013FY2012 are based on assumptions described in the next subsection. \nUJVNL\u2019s financial projections and past financial data are shown in Table A9.1.  \n \n  2.  Assumptions \n \n8.  Domestic inflation is projected using domestic cost escalation factors for 2005\u201320093 \npublished  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  and  at  4.8%  per  year  from  2010  onward. \nInternational  inflation  forecasts  use  the  international  cost  escalation  factors  2005\u201320094 \npublished by the World Bank, and thereafter are assumed to increase at 2% per year.  \n \n9.  The growth of electricity sales is positively correlated with the availability of an integrated \ntransmission network connected to hydropower stations and an electricity deficit from unmet \ndemand. The projected sale of power is derived from energy to be generated from UJVNL\u2019s \nplanned capital investments. Additional energy to be generated as a result of the proposed \nInvestment Program consists of the outputs of four small hydropower plants (SHPPs) and the \n                                                 \n2  The Ministry of Power allows 15% of generation capacity to be sold outside long-term power purchase agreements. \n3  India\u2019s Consumer Price Index is estimated at 4.2% for 2005, 3.0% for 2006, 3.5% for 2007, 4.7% for 2008, and \n6.4% for 2009. \n4  The Manufacturer\u2019s Unit Value index is 3.0% for 2005, 2.8% for 2006, 1.9% for 2007, 1.9% for 2008, and 1.9% for \n2009. \n ", "48  Appendix 9 \noutput following the renovation, monitoring, and upgrade of two existing SHPPs (Table A9.1). \nGeneration tariff calculations were based on current UERC norms. The generation tariff for the \nprojected years for new projects were adjusted to cover capital costs (depreciation, interest, and \nreturn on equity), with an allowable return on equity of 14% according to UERC regulations. \nUJVNL has three different tariff schemes for existing plants, new large hydropower plants, and \nnew SHPPs. Existing large and small hydropower plants have a flat tariff scheme of Rs0.37 per \nkilowatt-hour (kWh) and Rs1.7 per kWh, respectively, as stipulated in UERC\u2019s FY2004 tariff \norder, which UJVNL is currently challenging which will be resolved by a high court decision. For \nthe purpose of assessing UJVNL\u2019s financial viability, weighted average generation tariffs were \ncalculated based on UERC regulations and were assumed to increase at a measurable rate. \nInterstate surplus energy is expected to generate export income starting in FY2010 following the \ncommissioning of high-voltage transmission lines.  \n \n10.  Operating expenses consist of repairs and maintenance, fuel costs, salaries and wages, \nadministrative costs, and depreciation. Starting from current levels of around 4% of gross fixed \nassets, costs for the repairs and maintenance of generation assets were assumed to decline \nover time as new plants come into operation. Depreciation was calculated on a straight-line \nbasis at 2%5 in line with the Companies Act. Supplementary Appendix B provides more detailed \nassumptions and projections.  \n \nC.  Power Transmission Corporation of Uttaranchal, Limited  \n  1.   Financial Performance \n \n11.  PTCUL is a company owned by the government of Uttaranchal that was formed to take \nover and operate the state\u2019s transmission and dispatch system. The company\u2019s provisional \nfinancial statements for FY2004 which cover its first 9 months of operation, are currently being \nfinalized and audited. The main outstanding tasks are to complete the segregation of accounts \nand finalize the value of inventory and receivables. The company is conservatively set up with \nan initial debt to equity ratio of 31:69. During the start-up period, PTCUL has been able to \nachieve a 22% operating margin, generate a profit of Rs51 million, and maintain ample liquidity \nwith a current ratio of 55. As PTCUL owns and operates Uttaranchal\u2019s high-voltage transmission \nnetwork and is also the key provider of wheeling services for the burgeoning hydropower \ngeneration industry, its financial risks are relatively low. The major risks are inadequate cost \nrecovery from investment in transmission lines that may not be fully utilized and the potential \nadverse impact of unfavorable tariff decisions by the regulator.  \n \n12.  PTCUL\u2019s financial projections are presented in Table A9.2. The major assumptions are \ndetailed in the following subsection. The company\u2019s profitability is expected to grow in line with \nimprovements in the efficiency and effectiveness of its operational performance and to approach \nclose to the 14% return on equity ceiling allowed for under current regulations over time. The \ndevelopment of wheeling for the interstate transfers that will result from the Investment Program \nprovides an opportunity for the state regulator to allow PTCUL to pass on costs to customers \nelsewhere in the northern region. Funding for the Investment Program is significant and will \nenable PTCUL to undertake its planned investment and spread its debt-service obligations over \nthe medium to long term, consistent with the high capital costs and extended economic life of \nthe transmission network. As a result, projected financial performance indicators are favorable \nand show that PTCUL will have adequate debt-service coverage for the duration of the MFF. \n \n                                                 \n5  In line with UERC regulations, UJVNL uses accelerated depreciation over the repayment period for a loan and \nspreads the life of capital assets over the remaining years. ", "  Appendix 9  49 \n  2.  Assumptions \n \n13.  The  projected  transmission  revenue  stream  is  derived  from  projected  energy  to be \nwheeled by PTCUL. The tariff is a one-part uniform (\u201cpostage stamp\u201d) charge based on full \nrecovery  of  costs  incurred  in  delivering  energy  to  distributors.  The  \u201callowable\u201d  costs  are \nassumed to include the costs of transmission losses at up to 2.8% of gross energy entering the \ntransmission grid and the full capital costs of the investment program funded by the Asian \nDevelopment Bank, consisting of returns of capital (depreciation) and on capital (interest and \nreturn on equity) (Table A9.2). In line with UERC regulations, tariff realization is on a full cost-\nrecovery basis; however, the latest tariff order by UERC for FY2005\u20132006 did not allow recovery \nof the full cost of supply based on the inherited nature of the company\u2019s assets and liabilities. A \nwheeling charge of Rs0.10 per kWh was incorporated into the analysis, with a tariff level set on \nan ad hoc basis for the 9 months of operation in FY2004\u20132005. The latest wheeling charge \napproved by UERC for FY2005\u20132006 is Rs0.06 per kWh, which is reflected in the financial \nprojections. The wheeling charges for the projected years were adjusted upward over 5 years to \nmeet the allowable return on equity of 14% according to UERC regulations pertaining to new \ninvestments. The projections assume that surplus electricity after meeting in-state demand is \nexported to the northern and other regions. As such, interstate surplus energy is expected to \ngenerate export income starting in FY2010\u20132011. Prudent levels of operating costs can be \npassed through at actual costs in the tariff and include allowances for repairs and maintenance, \nsalaries and wages, administrative costs (including the transmission license fee) based on \nactual  costs  in  FY2004\u20142005,  and  taxes  and  depreciation.  Repair  and  maintenance  of \ntransmission assets are estimated at 1.8% of gross fixed assets, while administrative costs and \nsalaries and wages increase in line with domestic inflation.  \n  \n14.  PTCUL  is  in  the  process  of  finalizing  the  segregation  of  accounts  following  the \nunbundling of transmission from distribution. This process is due to be completed as UERC\u2019s \ntariff  order  of  2005\u20132006  becomes  effective.

Introduction \n \n1.  The financial analysis of the proposed investments has been carried out in accordance \nwith  the  Guidelines  for  the  Financial  Governance  and  Management  of  Investment  Project \nFinanced  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank.1  The  financial  evaluation  includes  appraised \ninvestment subprojects, mainly for clean energy development, by supporting the expansion of \nhydropower generating capacity through four new small hydropower plants (SHPPs) and the \nrenovation, monitoring, and upgrade of two existing SHPPs, and Part B, transmission system \nexpansion,  by  assisting  with  the  expansion  of  high-voltage  transmission  lines,  associated \nsubstations, and auxiliary equipment.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Major Assumptions \n2.  Capital costs were estimated in Indian rupees using prices prevailing in FY2004\u20132005, \nexpressed  in  constant  prices  over  the  construction  period  of  5  years.  The  analysis  was \nconducted over the period from FY2005\u20132006 to FY2025\u20132026. Capital costs were derived \nfrom  local  sources,  which  include  physical  contingencies.  Price  contingencies  and  interest \nduring construction were excluded in the estimation of capital costs. The investments were \nevaluated over a 20-year period to match the loan repayment cycle of 20 years. The salvage \nvalue of the proposed investments was calculated using a 2% straight-line depreciation method \nin line with Uttaranchal Electricity Regulatory Commission regulations during 2004. \n \n3.  Financial viability was examined by comparing the incremental costs and benefits of with \nand without investment scenarios. The incremental costs and benefits of each subproject were \nderived by assessing the financial position of the relevant company, that is, operation and \nmaintenance (O&M) costs and proposed wholesale generation and transmission tariffs. Capital \ninvestments and O&M costs were identified as incremental financial costs for the proposed \nInvestment Program. Incremental financial benefits were conservatively limited to additional \nelectricity  to  be  generated  and  transmitted  as  a  result  of  the  Investment  Program.  Tariff \ncalculations for generation and transmission were based on Uttaranchal Electricity Regulatory \nCommission  regulations  for  2004  on  terms  and  conditions  for  determining  generation  and \ntransmission tariffs, which permit the pass-through of full cost recovery of loan capital at a debt \nto equity ratio of 70:30; depreciation; 14% return on equity; O&M expenses; and interest on \nworking  capital  for  new  subprojects.  The  assumed  wholesale  generation  tariff used  in  the \nfinancial analysis was Rs1.7 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) and the tariff for transmission was Rs0.14 \nper kWh.2 It was assumed that RMU investments would apply the same tariff principles as new \nprojects in relation to being allowed to recover costs. \n \nC.  Weighted Average Cost of Capital \n \n4.  For estimating the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), it is assumed that the \nfinancing sources consist of the UED\u2019s equity contribution financed through retained earnings, \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2002. Guidelines for the Financial Governance and Management of Investment Projects Financed by the \nAsian Development Bank. Manila. \n2 The tariff order for 2004\u20132005 stipulates that SHPPs and microhydro projects would continue to charge the \nwholesale tariff of Rs1.7Rs per kWh as prevailed in the past for existing plants. However, for new projects, UERC \nallows both generation and transmission companies to recover annual revenue requirements consisting of (i) \ninterest on loan capital, (ii) depreciation, (iii) return on equity, (iv) O&M expenses, and (v) interest on working \ncapital.  ", "  Appendix 10  53 \ngovernment funding, and a combination of foreign and local currency loans. It is also assumed \nthat the foreign exchange premium exactly offsets the prevailing foreign inflation rate. These \nloans are expected to bear different nominal interest rates as provided below in Table A10.1. \nThe debt to equity ratio of 70:30 is maintained in calculating the WACC. The breakdown of the \ngovernment contribution and internally generated funds is assumed to be 70:30. The cost of \nequity  is  calculated  at 10%,  which  reflects  a 10-year  Indian  Government  bond  yield  as  a \nbenchmark, risk-free interest rate with a risk premium of 2.5%. The other assumptions include a \ndomestic inflation rate of 5.5% and a tax rate of 12%. The WACC for the Investment Program is \n4.36% (Table A10.1). \n \nTable A10.1: Weighted Average Cost of Capital \nItem  ADB Loan  Government  Internally  Total \n    Funding  Generated Fund   \nAmount ($\u2019000)  300,000 95,900 41,100  437,000\nWeighting (%)  69 22 9  100\nNominal cost (%)  5.0 10.0 10.0 \nTax rate (%)  12.0 0.0 0.0 \nTax-adjusted nominal cost (%)  4.4 10.0 10.0 \nInflation rate (%)  0.0 5.5 5.5 \nReal cost (%)  4.4 4.3 4.3 \nWeighted component of WACC  3.0 0.9 0.4  4.36\nADB = Asian Development Bank, WACC = Weighted Average Cost of Capital. \nNotes: 1. The equity composition of Government contribution and internally generated funds from PTCUL and UJVNL  \n                is based on 70:30. \n            2. Ten percent nominal cost for government contribution and internally generated fund consists of a ten-year  \n                 India Government bond plus spread. \n            3. Effective tax rate of 15% reflects a ten-year tax holiday for new projects. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nD.  Financial Internal Rate of Return \n \n5.  The  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  is  calculated  at  4.8%  for  clean  energy \nsubprojects  (Table  A10.2)  and  7.4%  for  transmission  subprojects  (Table  A10.3).  This  rate \ncompares favorably with the estimated value of the WACC of 4.36%, substantiating the financial \nviability of both core subprojects. Although not included in the FIRR calculation, the Investment \nProgram is expected to generate additional benefits from optimizing operational efficiency and \nfuel savings. The FIRR for clean energy investments is conservative, because the proposed \ntariff of Rs1.70/kwh is a \u201cfloor\u201d: when in-state demand is met, the power output can be traded in \nthe Northern Region grid at a premium tariff, typically Rs2.5/kwh or higher. As a year-round \ndaily power surplus is expected by the year 2012, the subprojects should be able to take \nadvantage of the higher open market tariff for most of the operating lifetime. Additional income \nfrom selling Clean Development Mechanism credits is estimated to increase the FIRR to 5.8%.  \n \n ", "54  Appendix 10 \nTable A10.2: Clean Energy Development \nFinancial Internal Rate of Return \n(Rs million) \nIncremental Cost    Incremental Benefit \nYear  Capital  O&M  Total    Generation (MWh)  Sales  Total  Net \n  Cost  Cost  Cost    SHP  RMU    SHP  RMU  Benefit  Benefit \n2006\u20132007  435  0  435    0  0  0  0  0  0  (435) \n2007\u20132008  1,016  0  1,016    0  0  0  0  0  0  (1,016) \n2008\u20132009  1,161  0  1,161    0  0  0  0  0  0  (1,161) \n2009\u20132010  290  23  313    0  39,669  39,669  0  57  67  (246) \n2010\u20132011  0  116  116    125,115  56,500  181,614  213  96  309  193 \n2011\u20132012  0  116  116    125,115  56,500  181,614  213  96  309  193 \n2012\u20132013  0  116  116    125,115  56,500  181,614  213  96  309  193 \n2013\u20132014  0  116  116    125,115  56,500  181,614  213  96  309  193 \n2014\u20132015  0  116  116    125,115  56,500  181,614  213  96  309  193 \n2015\u20132016  0  116  116    125,115  56,500  181,614  213  96  309  193 \n2016\u20132017  0  116  116    125,115  56,500  181,614  213  96  309  193 \n2017\u20132018  0  116  116    125,115  56,500  181,614  213  96  309  193 \n2018\u20132019  0  116  116    125,115  56,500  181,614  213  96  309  193 \n2019\u20132020  0  116  116    125,115  56,500  181,614  213  96  309  193 \n2020-2021  0  116  116    125,115  56,500  181,614  213  96  309  193 \n2021\u20132022  0  116  116    125,115  56,500  181,614  213  96  309  193 \n2022\u20132023  0  116  116    125,115  56,500  181,614  213  96  309  193 \n2023\u20132024  0  116  116    125,115  56,500  181,614  213  96  309  193 \n2024\u20132025  0  116  116    125,115  56,500  181,614  213  96  309  193 \n2025\u20132026  (2,032)  116  (1,916)    125,115  56,500  181,614  213  96  309  2,224 \nTotal  871  1,881  2,751              5,007  2,256 \n                       \n                    NPV  130 \n                    FIRR  4.8% \nFIRR = Financial Internal Rate of Return, MWh = megawatt-hour, NPV = net present value, O&M = operation and \nmaintenance, RMU = renovation, modernization, and upgrade, SHP = small hydropower plant \nNote: 1.

The  three  major  risks  pertaining  to  the  transmission  component  of  the  Investment \nProgram are (i) the timing of the commissioning of the associated large hydropower plants1 with \nrespect to timing of new transmission lines, which are all planned to be commissioned in 2010\u2013\n11; (ii) the identification of buyers through interstate power trading once in-state demand has \nbeen met in 2010; and (iii) the regulatory risks related to tariff setting. All the risks have a \nnoticeable impact on the revenue stream of the Power Transmission Corporation of Uttaranchal, \nLimited. The risks associated with (ii) and (iii) are also relevant to UJVNL. However, in UJVNL\u2019s \ncase, the risks are somewhat higher given that 26 large, medium, and small hydropower are to \nbe commissioned within 10 years, including four SHPPs funded by the Asian Development \nBank.  The  total  capacity  is  expected  to  be  2,597  MW,  with  an  investment  amount  of \napproximately  Rs136  billion  ($3  billion)  in  UJVNL\u2019s  pipeline.

Introduction \n1.  The proposed investments to be funded by ADB are part of an integrated generation and \ntransmission expansion program within Uttaranchal, and an integral component of the National \nElectricity Plan prepared by the Central Electricity Authority using least-cost planning principles. \nThe  economic  analysis  confirms  that  the  Investment  Program  will  ease  chronic  supply \nshortages in the northern region and help meet projected growth in demand for electric power. \nDemand forecasts and cost-benefit projections were prepared and analyzed, which indicate that \nthe Investment Program is economically viable.  \n \nB.   Demand Forecasts \n2.  The Central Electricity Authority prepares national electricity demand forecasts. The \nlatest available national forecast, the 16th electricity power survey, was carried out in 1999 and \ncovered energy demand and peak load requirements up to 2016\u20132017, using both short-term \n(2006\u20132007)  and  long-term  (2016\u20132017)  forecasting  methods.  The  survey  was  based  on \nhistorical  data  from  1992/93  to  1997/98.  The  short-term  forecast  ranged  from  1998/99  to \n2006/07, and was extended to 2011/12 for the long\u2013term forecast. However, actual electricity \nconsumption for the past 6 years demonstrates the following:  \n \n(i)  Overall electricity consumption overall was far below forecast levels.  \n(ii)  Growth  in  demand  for  1998\u20131999  to  2001\u20132002  was  extremely  low, \nrecovering somewhat in the next 2 years. \n(iii)  Consumption in almost every sector, including the domestic, agriculture, \n  industrial, and commercial sectors, was below projections.  \n \n3.  The National Electricity Plan and the survey load forecasts indicate that in 2006-2007, \nthe northern region\u2019s aggregate demand for and supply of energy will be in balance, but that a \n6.3%  capacity  deficit  will  occur  seasonally.  Furthermore,  by  the  time  the  transmission \nsubprojects have been completed (2011\u20132012), there will be a slight capacity surplus (0.8%). \nThese projections were reviewed in light of the unexpectedly low growth in demand during 2000 \nto 2005. Time series and regression analyses were used to analyze the results of the survey \nbased on gross domestic product (GDP) and electricity consumption from 1980\u20131981 to 2003\u2013\n2004. A forecast up to 2011\u20132012 was then prepared using the Asian Development Bank\u2019s \n(ADB\u2019s) forecast of real GDP growth. The revised forecasts based on projected GDP indicate \nthat the demand forecasts underlying the National Electricity Plan are sound and that the \nproposed investments are justified on demand and supply considerations.  \n \n4.  The base case, \u201cwith project,\u201d demand and supply balance is illustrated in Figure A11.1. \nIn the with project scenario, the northern region develops its hydropower resources. Thermal \npithead power supply capacity of 3,130 megawatts from the eastern region helps meet demand.  \n \n \n ", "58  Appendix 11 \n \nFigure A11.1: Inter-Regional Power Flows (MW): 2011-12 \u201cWith Project\u201d \n \nAP = Andra Pradesh, Chttis = Chattisgarh, H.P = Himachal Pradesh, J & K = Jammu and Kashmir, \nMAH = Maharashtra, MP = Madhya Pradesh, MW = megawatt, NHPC = National Hydropower \nDevelopment Corporation, NEEPCO = Northeast Power Company, TN = Tamil Nadu, U.A. = \nUttaranchal \n             Source: Draft National Electricity Plan 2005 Figure 9.2 \n \n5.  In the \u201cwithout project\u201d scenario, intensive hydropower development would not occur. In \nthis case, the grid extension would not be required, because the purpose of the proposed \ninvestment is to provide transmission from the new hydropower generating plants to the existing \ngrid. In the event of low hydropower development, the shortfall would be made up by increased \ncapacity from thermal power plants located in the Eastern and Western regions, supplemented \nby peaking capacity from gas turbines located at the load centers.

", "  Appendix 11  59 \nC.   Economic Analysis Calculations \n \n1.   Least-Cost Study \n \n6.  The  approach  taken  to  establish  the  least-cost  nature  of  the  proposed  Investment \nProgram is based on information extracted from the draft National Electricity Plan presented by \nthe Central Electricity Authority in March 2005. The planning approach and methodologies are \nas described in the draft plan. The material from the Central Electric Authority covers the overall \nsystem  planning  approach  for  India  and  is  supplemented  by  conclusions  from  ADB\u2019s \nindependent cost-benefit analysis.  \n \n2.   Least-Cost Review \n \n7.  Generation Options. The cost-benefit analysis includes a comparison of the delivered \ncosts of hydropower from Uttaranchal to the northern region\u2019s load centers with the delivered \ncost of thermal power supply from a mix of coal-fired power stations (base load) and gas-fired \npeaking  plants.  The  cost-benefit  analysis  indicates  that  hydropower  is  cheaper  than  the \nalternative thermal power option. \n \n8.  Transmission Options. Although in theory the various hydropower developers could \nbuild their own dedicated power evacuation facilities, few, if any, options for developing different \nlines and routes are available because of topographical and environmental constraints. The \nintegrated Transmission Network Plan is therefore the only realistic routing option.  \n \n3.  Cost-Benefit Analysis \n \n9.  Resource Cost Saving. Comparison of the with and without project scenarios indicates \nthat the delivery of hydropower will partly displace more expensive thermal power and will partly \nserve induced demand for incremental electricity. The resource cost savings are estimated as \nthe difference in cost between hydropower electricity, priced at $0.053 per kilowatt-hour and \nthermal power electricity priced at $0.064 per kilowatt-hour for bulk deliveries at the load centers \nof the northern region.  \n \n10.  Willingness to Pay. The willingness of domestic consumers within the northern region \nto  pay  for  additional  energy  (incremental  consumption)  was  calculated  by  developing  a \nconsumer demand function. The form of the demand function follows ADB\u2019s ERD Technical \nNote No. 3.1 For other categories of consumption, the average tariff for each category of \nconsumer was taken as a proxy of consumers\u2019 willingness to pay. This approach is considered \nconservative given that tariffs, particularly for agriculture, are subsidized and priced well below \nalternative forms of energy supply. \n \nD.  Results \n \n11.  Excluding a consideration of environmental benefits, the projected economic internal \nrate of return (EIRR) is 21%, which is above the economic cost of capital criterion of 12%. A \npresent value of $136.0 million for the net benefit of the Investment Program was identified as \nwell. The economic viability was justified accordingly. When environmental benefits (global \ngreenhouse gas reductions) are taken into account, the EIRR is 28%, with a present value of \n$283.0 million. \n                                                 \n1  Asian Development Bank. 2002. Economics and Research Department Technical Note No. 3. Manila. \n ", "60  Appendix 11 \n12.  A series of sensitivity studies was carried out by taking into consideration various key \nfactors that could have significant adverse impacts on the Investment Program. The studies \nincluded a capital cost overrun of 10%, a reduction in energy sales of 5%, a 1-year delay in \nbenefits,  and  all  impacts  together.  The  results  showed  that  the  EIRRs  for  these  negative \nchanges were in the range of 10 to 19%, excluding the environmental benefits. The only factor \nthat brought the EIRR below the 12% criterion was a reduction in energy sales, which appears \nto be the least likely possibility given the unmet demand that exists in the Northern Region and \nmost of India. When the environmental benefits were included, the EIRR was at least 21%. \nThus the economic viability of the Investment Program is considered robust.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis  \nSector identified as a National Priority in    Sector identified as a National Priority in country  N/A  \nCountry Poverty Analysis?    Yes  poverty Partnership Agreement?  \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in India:  \nMajor interventions in the energy sector are designed to achieve economic progress through infrastructure development. \nBoth physical investment support and sector reform are necessary so that the benefits from economic growth will accrue \nto the poor. Improved transmission and cleaner and renewable hydropower will specifically benefit the poor because they \nare the most adversely affected by pollution and environmental degradation. \n \nThe Investment Program will reduce system losses and improve frequency and voltage levels, leading to more efficient \nenergy use and making more power available to support economic growth. By expanding generation capacity and the \ntransmission grid, the Investment Program is expected to result in efficient and more reliable delivery of services to \nconsumers, particularly benefiting commercial, residential, and agricultural customers in the region. The integrated \ngeneration and transmission expansion program will fulfill all in-state demand and will eventually provide surplus power \nfor export. This will generate new income for the state government that will be devoted to economic and social \ndevelopment. \n \nPoor and vulnerable consumers, including hospitals, schools, and other social utilities, who are often the hardest hit by \ninadequate power supply, load shedding, and poor power quality, will benefit directly from the subprojects. Direct positive \neconomic and social benefits will result from the Investment Program. Power generated by small hydropower plants will \nbe connected to the local grid at 33 kilovolts, which will contribute to the Government\u2019s goal of providing affordable, \nuniversal electric service by 2012. Increasing power supplies to local grids will bring the benefits of electricity to remote \ncommunities, including better health care, sanitation, and education; greater income-earning opportunities; and higher \nliving standards. The renovation, modernization, and of existing hydropower plants will provide more reliable power to the \nexisting grid.  \n \nA positive, direct impact on local labor is expected during implementation and an indirect impact will be due to the \nincreased income-earning opportunities generated by increased access to electricity. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                         Proposed Classification: General intervention \nTechnical assistance consultants have prepared a social impact assessment and a poverty impact assessment. A \nsocioeconomic survey was undertaken to provide a basis for the assessments.  \n \nUttaranchal is one of India\u2019s poorest states. The per capita net state domestic product was Rs13,000 in 2002, compared \nwith the national average of Rs18,000. A recent survey noted that 36% of rural families in Uttaranchal are below the \npoverty line. Poverty is unevenly distributed throughout the state, with pockets of extreme poverty in the interior rural \nareas. A third of the population in Uttaranchal does not own land and lives in rented accommodations. Sharp differences \nare apparent between districts. Dehradun and Nainital have higher than average per capita income, while Bageshwar, \nChamoli, Pithoragarh, and Uttarkashi have lower than average per capita income and are considered to be extremely \npoor. The incidence of poverty ranges from 18% of the population living below the poverty line in Haridwar to 69% in \nUttarkashi. The average below the poverty line population in rural areas of Garhwal division (seven districts), where most \nof the transmission subproject investments are located, is 46%, skewed upward by high figures in Uttarkashi, Tehri (57%), \nand Chamoli (52%). About one third of the population in rural areas in the other hill districts is below the poverty line. \nAccording to the government of Uttaranchal, about 416,018 people were identified as living below the poverty line in \n2002. Based on a total population of 8,489,349 according to the 2001 census and the percentage of people living below \nthe poverty line noted by the Planning Commission, the total number of people living below the poverty line is estimated \nat 292,800, which in lower than the figures estimated by the Uttaranchal government (and is higher than in the \nneighboring state of Himachal Pradesh).  \n \nEmployment in Uttaranchal is mostly agriculture and forest based. According to statistical data, around 37% of the total \npopulation works, of which 27% have regular employment and 10% are part-time workers.  \n \nThe Investment Program is expected to create new full-time employment opportunities. For civil  works on small \nhydropower plant and renovation, monitoring, and upgrade investments, UJVNL expects to hire 160 and 240 unskilled \nworkers, respectively, for a period of 3 years. For the civil works on transmission lines, about 650 unskilled local workers \nwill be hired for a period of 18 months. Improved power supplies will induce light industrial and commercial activity, \ncreating employment opportunities and improving the productivity and quality of outputs in the manufacturing and \nagriculture sectors.

All stakeholders have been actively involved to reduce the likelihood of \ngrievances and to ensure that benefits are distributed fairly. In addition, for the selection of unskilled labor in the project \narea, the contractors will consult with local township labor officials and local village leaders and will also ensure that labor \nis hired on a nondiscriminatory basis.  \n \nD.

Core Subproject Description and Area \n \n1.  The core subprojects1 are (i) small hydropower plants, namely, Kaliganga-I (Jaltlala and \nKhunnu Kotimasheswari villages, Rudraprayag district), Kaliganga-II (Khunnu Kotimasheswari \nand Kobilta villages, Rudraprayag district); Madhyamaheswar (Girriyagon and Chuni villages, \nRudraprayag district), and Kaldigad (Sangam Chatti village, Uttarkashi district); and renovation, \nmodernization,  and  upgrade;  (ii)  expansion  of  the  Alakananda  basin  and  Bhagirati  basin \ntransmission systems, including Kuwari Pass (Ravigram village, Chamoli district) and Srinagar \n(Khandukhal village, Pauri district) substations; and (iii) capacity building.  \n \nB.  Scope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n \n2.  The  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts  of  the  core  subprojects  have  been \nassessed and documented in a Resettlement Plan. Based on the Resettlement Plan, core \nsubprojects for clean energy development will require 24.06 hectares (ha) of permanent land \nacquisition (both private and public) and 179.21 ha of temporary land acquisition.2 Transmission \nexpansion  will  require  13.99  ha  of  permanent  land  acquisition  and  no  temporary  land \nacquisition.  Capacity  building  will  not  involve  any  land  acquisition  or  resettlement.  Land \nacquisition and resettlement resulting from the core subprojects will affect 25 households on a \npermanent basis and 229 on a temporary basis. None of the components will cause any loss of \nstructures. \n \nC.  Scope of the Resettlement Framework \n \n3.  The resettlement framework was prepared for the noncore subprojects as required by \nADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy3  for  sector  lending.  The  resettlement  framework \nidentifies the broad scope of the Investment Program and outlines the policy, procedures, and \ninstitutional requirements for preparing subsequent subprojects under the sector loan. The \nexecuting agency will be the UED (UED). The implementing agencies will be the PTCUL and \nUJVNL. The project management office (PMO), through project implementation units (PIUs), will \nbe responsible for preparing social analysis and resettlement plans for subprojects as outlined \nin the resettlement framework. The draft resettlement plans will be submitted to the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) for review and approval prior to contract award, and compensation \nwill be paid to all affected persons prior to displacement, or in any case, no later than the \ncommencement of civil works. \n \nD.  Resettlement Policy and Framework \n \n4.  The 1894 Land Acquisition Act (LAA), as amended in 1984, and the National Policy on \nResettlement and Rehabilitation for Project Affected Persons provides the legal framework for \nland acquisition for public purposes in India. They enable state governments to acquire private \nland for public purposes and ensure that no one is deprived of land except as provided for under \nthe act and the policy. The resettlement framework is based on both Government and ADB \npolicy. The resettlement framework and resettlement procedural guidelines will apply to all \n                                                 \n1  During project implementation, additional subprojects will be appraised by the Uttaranchal Energy Department and will \nbe reviewed and approved by the Asian Development Bank in accordance with established project administration \nprocedures. \n2  Of the 179 ha temporarily acquired, lost agricultural income from an estimated 115 ha of agricultural land will be \ncompensated. The average household size in Uttaranchal is 5.29 people and the average land tenure is 0.5 ha. No \nland acquisition is expected for the renovation, monitoring, and upgrade. \n3   ADB. 1995.

Procedure for Resettlement Plan Preparation \n \n6.  Resettlement plans for non-core subprojects will be prepared in the following manner: (i) \nthe PIU, guided by the PMO, will undertake social impact assessment surveys for identified \nsubprojects  based  on  preliminary  technical  designs;  (ii)  if  impacts  are  significant,5  full \nresettlement plans will be prepared for each subproject; (iii) if impacts are not significant, short \nResettlement Plans will be required for project preparation; and iv) resettlement plans will \ninclude measures to ensure that women\u2019s socioeconomic conditions, needs, and priorities are \nidentified and that the process of land acquisition and resettlement does not disadvantage \nwomen.6 The PIU, PMO, and consultants for project preparation and implementation will include \nsocial specialists familiar with ADB policy and procedures for the preparation of subproject \nresettlement  plans.  The  resettlement  plans  must  comply  with  this  agreed  resettlement \nframework. The resettlement plans for core subprojects will be used as a model for preparing \nand implementing noncore subprojects. The draft resettlement plans will be submitted to ADB \nfor review and approval prior to contract award, and compensation will be paid to all affected \npersons prior to displacement, or in any case, no later than the commencement of civil works.7  \n \nD.  Institutional Arrangements and Budget \n \n7.  For subproject resettlement plans, the PMO will have overall coordination, planning, \nimplementation, and financing responsibilities. The PMO will set up an environment and social \ndepartment. The department will have a full-time resettlement specialist for the duration of the \nprojects under the MFF to head the department\u2019s Resettlement Unit who will ensure timely and \n                                                 \n5  Resettlement is significant when 200 or more people experience major impacts. Major impacts are defined as \npeople being physically displaced from housing and/or losing 10% or more of their productive, income-generating \nassets. \n6 UED and the implementing agencies, through the PMO and PIUs, will ensure that this agreed on resettlement \nframework is closely followed during the preparation of resettlement plans.
