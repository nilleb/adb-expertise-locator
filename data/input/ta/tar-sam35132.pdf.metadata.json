During  the  2002  country  programming  mission,  the  Government  of  Samoa  (the \nGovernment) confirmed its request for technical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) to prepare the feasibility study for the proposed Savai\u2019i renewable energy project.1 \nA proposed loan of $10.0 million for the project is included in the Samoa country strategy and \nprogram for 2005. In August 2002, the fact-finding mission was fielded. An understanding was \nreached on the TA purpose, key activities, consultants\u2019 terms of reference, cost estimates and \nfinancing, and implementation arrangements. The TA framework is given in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Local  renewable  energy  development  is  an  important  element  underpinning  the \ngovernment strategy for economic growth and social development in Samoa. ADB has provided \nassistance for power sector development since 1971. Starting with the first TA in 1971, when \nADB assisted the corporatization of the power supply service and the creation of the Electric \nPower Corporation (EPC), ADB has provided 13 TAs and 8 loans to the power sector. In \nparticular, ADB has provided advisory assistance for the commercialization of EPC\u2014including \ninstitutional strengthening and policy reforms, tariff and revenue studies, and improvement of \nfinancial management\u2014and lending assistance for the development of the hydropower potential \nof the capital island of Upolu. EPC has dramatically improved its financial viability2 and degree \nof social responsibility,3 while providing a significant share of power supply from local renewable \nresources, including a hydropower capacity equal to 75% of the demand during the wet season \nand 37% during the dry season. \n \n3.  The Government intends to improve its peoples\u2019 living standards and enable private \nsector development on the island of Savai\u2019i which lags behind the capital island of Upolu in \nhardship and poverty. On the basis of the 1997 household income and expenditure survey,4 the \nshare of households under the basic needs poverty line is 55% in Savai\u2019I island and 48% \nnationwide. More recently, the share of households under the food poverty line has been \nestimated at 41% in Savai\u2019i island and 35% nationally.5 The Government has requested ADB to \nconsider  assisting  the  power  sector  to  provide  an  adequate,  reliable,  and  environmentally \nsustainable power supply at least cost to the island of Savai\u2019i by developing the hydropower \npotential of the Sili River basin.  \n \n4.  In June 1996, EPC commissioned a feasibility study of the Sili River hydro potential.6 In \nAugust 1996, the survey group carried out field investigations on land and from the air and \ngathered the necessary data.7 The study concluded that it is possible to develop electric power \nfrom the Sili River at its midstream valley. The proposed Sili no. 1 hydropower project consists \nof taking in water from six streams and gathering the water in a comparatively flat tableland area \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet version) on 15 February 2002. \n2  In 2002, EPC will have a profit for the first time in its 31-year history. \n3  EPC has completed a broad rural development program and has recently adopted a lifeline tariff for low-income \nconsumers. EPC was recently commended for providing reliable power to the poor (ADB. 2002. Participatory \nAssessment of Hardship. Manila). \n4 United Nations Development Programme-Secretariat of the Pacific Community. 1997. Food and Basic Needs \nExpenditure Report. Apia. \n5  ADB. 2002.

After being stored in an offstream regulating pond, the water can be \nconducted to a powerhouse site via a head tank and penstock. The maximum output of the \npowerhouse is 3,600 kilowatts (kW),8 which can be obtained by a maximum discharge of 3.0 \ncubic meters per second, using a total head9 of 162 meters.  \n \n5.  The study suggested dividing the construction into two stages of 1,800 kW each. The \nfirst stage (2 units of 900 kW) will produce 5,137 megawatt-hours (MWh) annually to supply a \npeak load of 1,763 kW (March 1995). The addition of the second stage (another 2 units of 900 \nkW)  will  supply  an  additional  8,758  MWh  for  a  total  annual  supply  of  13,715  MWh.  The \nconstruction cost was estimated at $16.0 million for the first stage and at $10.1 million for the \nsecond stage, for a total project cost of $26.1 million.   \n  \n6.  In October 1997, the ADB-financed Power Development Plan10 estimated for the Sili \nRiver an optimum run-of-the-river hydro installed capacity of 4,500 kW (1,100 kW during the dry \nseason) for a long-term average annual output of 13,160 MWh. However, it concluded that there \nwas insufficient demand at that time for this amount of energy in Savai\u2019i. \n \n7.  Since then, the energy demand on Savai\u2019i island has increased dramatically. In 1991, \nthe system peak demand was only 800 kW. In April 2002, a record peak demand of 2,688 kW \nwas reported. In the last decade, Savai\u2019i system peak demand has achieved a compound \nannual growth rate of 11.65%. In December 2001, two new diesel generators totaling 1,600 kW \nwere installed, increasing the total generation capacity of Savai\u2019i island to 2,060 kW. A new \ntown and cannery factories are proposed for Savai\u2019i island. Hence, there is an urgent need for \nEPC to increase the firm generation capacity in the Savai\u2019i system.    \n \n8.  The expected impact of the proposal is minimal. Water is to be drawn at intake dams \nand returned to the river after power generation. No private houses are near the project site. \nThe project area is generally a mix of secondary dense vegetation and scattered plantations of \ncoconut trees typically found on Savai\u2019i island. The summary initial poverty and social analysis \nis reported in Appendix 2. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n9.  The TA will establish a least-cost power development plan for the island of Savai\u2019i. The \nplan will consider the development of local renewable resources, including water resources of \nthe Sili River basin, for providing adequate power generation on the island. The TA will assess \nthe social, institutional, and environmental aspects of the sector, recommend development \nstrategies,  and,  in  coordination  with  the  assistance  on  the  implementation  of  state-owned \nenterprise reform11 and of private sector development,12 explore the possibility of private sector \nparticipation in the sector. It will also identify and carry out a feasibility study and develop a \nsmall-scale hydro project suitable for financing by ADB or other external funding agencies, and \nassess its long-term sustainability. \n                                                 \n8  The total hydro capacity was estimated at 5.9 MW: 3.6MW Sili hydropower no. 1 and 2.3 MW Sili hydropower no. 2. \n9  Head is the vertical distance by which water drops. The amount of energy that can be captured is a function of both \nthe head and the volume of water. \n10 ADB. 1999.

The project will reduce the need \nto run diesel power stations in Savai\u2019i, with considerable savings to EPC in imported fuel costs \nand reduced emission of greenhouse gases. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The  assistance  will  be  implemented  in  two  stages:  (i)  assessment  of  the  social, \ninstitutional,  and  environmental  aspects  of  the  proposed  power  supply  in  Savai\u2019i;  and  (ii) \ndevelopment of a hydropower project suitable for financing by ADB or other external funding \nagencies and assessment of its long-term sustainability. \n \n12.  Phase 1 will (i) review relevant studies with regard to power demand and supply in \nSavai\u2019i; (ii) forecast power demand; (iii) formulate a long-term power development strategy and \nleast-cost option to meet the assessed demand that will maximize economic, social, and poverty \nreduction impacts; (iv) in close consultation with stakeholders, formulate a realistic 10-year \ninvestment plan for power supply development, including new generation renewable energy \nsupply; and (v) explore the possibility of private sector participation. \n \n13.  Based on the results of phase 1, Phase 2 will develop a hydropower supply project \nsuitable for external financing. Phase 2 will (i) identify the highest priority components of the \nproject for ADB financing in terms of poverty reduction impact; (ii) prepare a feasibility level \ndesign  for  the  project,  including  scope,  components,  cost  estimates,  implementation \narrangements,  and  operation  and  maintenance  procedures;  (iii)  undertake  a  detailed \nsocioeconomic  survey,  initial  environmental  examination,13  and  financial  and  economic \nevaluation of the project; (iv) assess the implementation capacity and future operation and \nmaintenance  capacity;  (v)  propose  institutional  improvements  suitable  to  ensure  efficient \nimplementation  of  the  project,  including  possible  private  sector  participation;  and  (vi) \nrecommend sustainable measures to be adopted to ensure that the poor can benefit from the \nproject. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $400,000 equivalent, with a foreign exchange cost of \n$273,000 and a local currency cost of $127,000 equivalent (Appendix 3). ADB will provide \n$300,000 equivalent to finance all of the foreign exchange cost and $27,000 equivalent of the \nlocal currency cost. The TA will be financed by ADB on a grant basis by the Japan Special \nFund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government will contribute $100,000 equivalent \nto finance the remaining local currency cost. The Government has been advised that approval \nof the TA does not commit ADB to financing any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  EPC will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The Government will provide all available \nrelevant information and facilitate the collection of socioeconomic data. The Government will \nalso help ensure adequate cooperation from local government bodies and nongovernment \norganizations active in the project area. \n                                                 \n13 Although the project is likely to be rated by ADB as an environmental category B project, the Government will \nrequire a full environmental impact assessment. ", "4 \n \n16.  ADB will engage the services of international and domestic consultants, with relevant \nexperience in all aspects of the specified scope of work. The consultants will be selected \nthrough the quality and cost-based selection method as well as simplified TA submission in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. The international consultants \nwill have expertise in (i) power system planning and power economics, (ii) hydropower station \ndesign, (iii) economic and financial analysis, (iv) environmental assessment, (v) social and \npoverty  impact  assessment,  and  (vi)  resettlement  planning  (if  required).  The  domestic \nconsultants will have expertise in social and community development and participation. An \nestimated total of 12 person-months of consulting services will be required: 9 for international \nand 3 for domestic consulting services. The outline terms of reference for the consultants are \ngiven in Appendix 4.  \n \n17.  EPC/Government will recruit/appoint a project manager with qualifications acceptable to \nADB. Some of the office equipment will be financed under the TA and will be procured by the \ninternational consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.14 \n \n18.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  a  period  of  about  9  months.  It  is  expected  to \ncommence in January 2003 and be completed by September 2003. Within 3 weeks after \ncommencement of the TA, the consultants will submit a brief inception report summarizing their \ninitial findings, identifying specific issues, and suggesting changes to the methodology and \nprogram, if any. Within 6 months after TA commencement, the consultants will submit a draft \nfinal report for ADB and EPC comments. A tripartite meeting among EPC, ADB, and the \nconsultants will discuss the draft final report and any changes to be made. Subsequently, the \nconsultants will make all the recommended changes and submit the final report within 1 month \nof the tripartite meeting. The TA will produce design and analytical results that fully comply with \nall relevant ADB policies. The consultants will submit three copies of all reports to ADB and six \ncopies to EPC. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Samoa for preparing the Savai\u2019i Renewable Energy Project, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n14  The computer equipment will be transferred to EPC upon TA completion.
