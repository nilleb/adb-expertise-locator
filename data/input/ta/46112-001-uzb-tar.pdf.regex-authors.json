INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  Government  of  Uzbekistan  has  requested  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to \nprovide technical assistance (TA) to further develop the insurance sector. This is in line with the \ngovernment\u2019s priorities for reforms and sustainable improvement of Uzbekistan\u2019s finance and \nbanking system, and measures to develop the microfinance and nonbank financial subsectors \nthrough comprehensive activities set out in the government\u2019s action plan for 2011\u20132015. The TA \nis  in  line  with  the  country  partnership  strategy,  2012\u201320161 and  included  in  the  county \noperations business plan, 2012-2014.2 A reconnaissance mission was fielded on 28 November\u2013\n2 December 2011,3 at which time an understanding was reached with the government on the TA \nimpact, outcome, outputs, cost estimates, financing plan, implementation arrangements, and \nconsultants\u2019 terms of reference. The design of the TA was discussed in particular with the State \nInsurance  Supervisory  Board  (SISB),  the  insurance  market  regulator.  The  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.4  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  As of December 2011, Uzbekistan had 30 commercial banks with 822 branches and \nabout  1,800  minibank  offices,  34  microcredit  organizations,  48  pawnshops,  46  leasing \ncompanies, and 37 insurance companies (34 general insurance companies, 2 life insurance \ncompanies, and 1 reinsurance company). There is also one stock exchange. Total assets of \ncommercial banks were $15.3 billion or the equivalent of 35.3% of gross domestic product (GDP) \nin 2011. The securities market is shallow\u2014government and corporate bonds, and corporate \nstocks are the only three financial instruments.  \n \n3.  The insurance market penetration5 of 0.4% of GDP in 2010 is low compared with the \nglobal average of 6.9% of GDP and emerging markets average of 3.0% of GDP. Insurance \nspending per capita is also low\u2014the insurance density rate equaled $4.506 per capita in 2010 \ncompared with the global average of $627.00.7  \n \n4.  The market is dominated by state-owned insurers\u2014Uzbekinvest, Uzagrosugurta, and \nKafolat. Uzbekinvest is the largest insurer in terms of investments (45.0% of the total held by the \nsubsector) followed by Uzagrosugurta (7.0% of the total held by the subsector). Underwriting \npremiums in 2011 equaled $129 million, an increase of 36.6% over 2010, while claims equaled \n$25.1 million, an increase of 65.7%. This resulted in a low loss ratio (claims paid to premiums \nearned) of 19.5% and allowed the industry to continue to earn large underwriting profits (the \ndifference between premiums earned and claims paid). Of total earnings held by insurance firms, \n45.1% was held in banks as deposits, 41.2% was invested in securities and corporate bonds, \n6.5% was invested in real estate, and 5.6% in equity capital. \n \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2012. Country Partnership Strategy: Uzbekistan, 2012\u20132016. Manila \n2  ADB. 2012. Country Operations Business Plan: Uzbekistan, 2012-2014. Manila. \n3  In connection with the Tashkent International Insurance and Reinsurance Conference in April 2011, the design of \nthe TA was further discussed with the State Insurance Supervisory Board, the Association of Professional \nParticipants of the Uzbekistan Insurance Market, as well as other relevant stakeholders. \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 23 November 2012. \n5  Insurance penetration, calculated as the ratio of total insurance premiums to GDP, indicates the growth of \ninsurance consumption. Insurance density, calculated as the ratio of total insurance premiums to total population, \nindicates how much each inhabitant of a country spends each year for insurance services. \n6  To calculate the insurance density ratio, ADB used the National Statistics and Ministry of Finance data on \ninsurance premium amounts collected, population, and GDP. \n7  World Insurance in 2010. Sigma No 2/2011, Swiss Re. \n ", "2   \n \n \n5.  Major insurance products include compulsory motor insurance, compulsory employer's \nliability, contractor's all-risk insurance, property insurance (against pledges and all types of \ncatastrophes), and export credit insurance. The introduction of mandatory motor third-party \nliability insurance in 2008 helped the insurance market expand. Companies are the major \ninsurance  buyers.  In  2011,  their  contribution  to  total  premiums  was  73.7%  ($94.1  million) \ncompared  with  26.3%  collected  from  individuals.  Insurance  penetration  is  concentrated  in \nTashkent City with about 60% of collected insurance premiums. The remaining 40% come from \nthe 13 regions where about 90% of the population resides. \n \n6.  ADB provided TA for the Development of the Insurance Industry,8 approved on 11 May \n2000 for $0.30 million. That TA supported the initial development of Uzbekistan\u2019s insurance \nmarket by (i) supporting background work for the development of a medium-term insurance sector \nreform strategy, (ii) bringing insurance regulations broadly in line with international standards with \ncertain  transitional  measures,  (iii)  revising  the  insurance  law,9 and  (iv)  strengthening  the \ninstitutional capacity of SISB to ensure adequate supervision of insurance companies. SISB \nviews the strengthening of capacity for insurance market supervision as a key area of focus.  \n \n7.  The slow penetration of general insurance and negligible growth of life insurance can be \nattributed to regulatory, social, human development, and cultural factors, as well as the state-\ndominated market structure. Some of the major impediments include (i) weak competition in the \ninsurance market, where premium discounting is a common practice; (ii) insurance agents\u2019 poor \nknowledge about the products they sell; (iii) an unbalanced relationship between the insured \nand  the  insurer,  which  favors  industry  profitability  but  undermines  the  development  of  the \nmarket;  (iv)  difficulty  in  regulating  solvency  requirements  of  private  insurers;  (v)  lack  of \nseparation between shareholder funds and policyholder funds; and (vi) low per capita income. \n \n8.  Finance sector regulators and policymakers can play an important role in overcoming \nthese obstacles. They can promote policies that enable the market to develop while helping \nbuild and retain consumer confidence and trust. This can be achieved through regulations and \nsupervision  that  promote  a  safe,  sound,  competitive,  and  accessible  insurance  sector. \nPromotion of information sharing with consumers, both firms and individuals, can also help \ndeepen the insurance market. \n \n9.  The key development issues to be addressed by the TA are the regulatory frameworks, \nand  the  capacity  of  SISB  and  other  relevant  authorities.  Greater  penetration  of  insurance \nservices can play an important role in diversifying the finance sector, which is dominated by \nbanks, and in boosting the ability of the financial system to manage financial shocks and periods \nof uncertainty. This will contribute to the stability of economic processes through better risk \nmanagement, bolster social welfare through greater financial security, and stimulate economic \ngrowth by encouraging the flow of long-term private capital for infrastructure investment. \n \n10.  The TA will reinforce the active steps that the government and market participants have \nalready taken to create more favorable conditions for the expansion of a functional and efficient \ninsurance sector in Uzbekistan. This is needed to help mitigate insurable risks for small and \nmedium-sized enterprises and individuals, and increase the accumulation of contractual savings \nused for investment in the country. In particular, the TA will help improve the efficiency of \nsupervision of the insurance system, and deepen insurance penetration through better product \ndesign and use of alternative distribution channels.
