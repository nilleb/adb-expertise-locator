INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will facilitate the rapid adoption of \nadvanced technologies to improve the productivity and profitability of the agriculture sector in \nPunjab province, Pakistan. It will help increase farmers\u2019 access to such technologies to strengthen \nagriculture value chains in rural Punjab. It will also enable further development and adoption of \nadvanced technologies to benefit the agriculture sector. The TA will contribute to farmers\u2019 higher \nincome, improved livelihood in rural communities, increased food security, and sustainable \nagriculture growth of the province. \n \n2.  The  Punjab  Agriculture  Department  (PAD)  requested  assistance  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to improve the overall performance of the agriculture sector through \nstrengthened value chains supported by advanced technologies. The TA is in line with ADB\u2019s \nStrategy  2030,  which  prioritizes  rural  development  and  food  security,  and  the  adoption  of \nadvanced technologies in ADB operations.1 The country partnership strategy for Pakistan, 2015\u2013\n2019  supports  inclusive  growth  and  knowledge  solutions.2 The  Government  of  Punjab\u2019s \nagriculture policy emphasizes modernized agriculture management and improved value chain \ndevelopment.3 The TA is not included in the country operations business plan for Pakistan, 2019\u2013\n2021.4  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.   Agriculture is central to Pakistan\u2019s economy and food security. The agriculture sector \ncontributes 20% to the country\u2019s gross domestic product, employs 42% of its labor force, \ncontributes 65% of export earnings, and provides livelihood to 62% of the rural population. Punjab \nis the country\u2019s largest province in terms of population and economy. Its population totals 110 \nmillion, of which 65% reside in rural areas. The province covers nearly 73% of the national \ncropped area and 78% of the country\u2019s irrigated area. It contributes about 57% to the production \nvalue of the country\u2019s agriculture, which accounts for more than 26% of Punjab\u2019s gross domestic \nproduct and employs over 40% of the provincial labor force. The province provides a large share \nof the country\u2019s main crops: maize (78%), wheat (77%), cotton (73%), sugarcane (63%), and rice \n(52%).5 \n \n4.   Pakistan\u2019s average annual agriculture growth rate  has declined from 3.7% during 2001\u2013\n2009  to  2.1%  during  2010\u20132017  because  of a  number  of  challenges.6 These  include  the \ninadequate availability of high-yielding cultivars and lack of diversification in cultivation, inefficient \non-farm water management, poor infrastructure for value chain development, weak research and \nextension services that are largely disconnected from market demands, and lack of advanced \nagriculture management supported by new technologies and innovations. In addition, some policy \nand regulatory issues such as an enormous public wheat procurement program, excess subsidies \nin production, a weak seed management system, and poor access by farmers to capital and \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2018.

The country\u2019s agriculture \ngrowth rate has been below 3% during 2010-2017, whereas it was over 5% in the 1980s and over 4% in 1990s. \n \n ", "2 \nfinancial resources have contributed to the sector\u2019s underperformance. \n \n5.   These challenges are further aggravated by, among others, (i) the country\u2019s projected \npopulation growth rate, combined with improving living standards and lifestyle changes, especially \nin cities, and consequent changes in food demand in terms of quantity and quality; (ii) increasing \ncompetition for essential inputs such as land, labor, and water from other sectors in the economy; \nand (iii) increasing international competition for export commodities, especially for high-value \nproduce. All of these factors have contributed to the provincial agriculture growth not benefiting \nthe rural poor in Punjab relative to its potential. This situation is further exacerbated by the \ncountry\u2019s exposure to projected climate change impacts.7 \n \n6.   The Punjab Agriculture Policy 2018 approved by the provincial government in November \n2018, has identified a critical need for the rapid adoption of advanced technologies to revitalize \nthe province\u2019s agriculture sector. Many new types of advanced technologies for agriculture have \nbeen introduced and have now become available for use in Asian countries including in India, the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, and Thailand. These include high-efficiency irrigation systems, \nmechanized farming technologies, and farming and marketing management systems based on \ninformation  and  communication  technology  (ICT).  The  use  of  these  technologies  has \ndemonstrated sound efficiency in farming activities in terms of productivity and profitability.8 In \nPunjab, such technologies have been introduced and piloted by large and progressive farmers. \nHowever, the use of these technologies by small farmers, representing more than 90% of the total \nfarms in the province, is still very limited because of the lack of resources and opportunities for \ntheir access.9 This has resulted in small farmers being continuously marginalized in the value \nchain economy, eventually contributing to the sector\u2019s underperformance. \n \n7.   The ADB-financed Punjab Basmati Rice Value Chain knowledge and support TA, which \nwas implemented from 2014 to 2018, supported small farmers\u2019 use of advanced technologies in \ntheir farming practices for basmati rice, a premium commodity for export.10 The Basmati TA \nsuccessfully demonstrated to farmers the technologies of direct seeding for rice with laser land \nleveling, mechanized transplanting, and combine harvesting. The demonstration activities were \nconducted by private service providers, with the technical support of public and private research \ncenters  in  Punjab.11 Knowledge  of  the  demonstrated  technologies  and  results  were  also \nsuccessfully disseminated through an ICT tool to farmers and private service providers who \nparticipated in the TA activities.12 The Basmati TA set the stage for ADB private sector support to \nthe basmati rice producers. Based on the achievements of the Basmati TA, the PAD intends to \nfurther support Punjab\u2019s small farmers in using and adopting advanced technologies with a focus \non harvest, postharvest, and marketing activities for three grain crops\u2014rice, wheat, and maize\u2014\nthat are the main income source of many small farmers in Punjab. This further support will include \n                                                \n7  Government of Punjab, Planning and Development Board. 2015.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.   The TA is aligned with the following impact: Punjab\u2019s agriculture growth, rural livelihood, \nand food security improved.13 The TA will have the following outcome: farmers\u2019 adoption of \nadvanced technologies increased in TA pilot sites.14 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n9.  The TA will have four outputs: (i) demonstration of advanced harvest and postharvest \ntechnologies conducted; (ii) ICT-based direct marketing platform developed and installed; (iii) \ncapacity of stakeholders in developing and adopting advanced technologies increased; and (iv) \ninvestment opportunities to scale up the adoption of technologies formulated. Outputs 1 and 2 will \nbe delivered through the pilot testing and demonstration activities in which small farmers and \nprivate service providers will be invited to participate.15 TA testing and demonstration pilot sites \nwill be in areas where farmers produce the three major crops. The TA will incorporate public and \nprivate research centers\u2019 technical support for testing and demonstrating technologies through \nboth on-farm and laboratory-based research and development activities. \n \n10.  Output  1:  Demonstration  of  advanced  harvest  and  postharvest  technologies \nconducted. The output will support small farmers in accessing advanced technologies for \nimproved harvest and postharvest handling. Private service providers will demonstrate such \ntechnologies to small farmers. Good harvest and postharvest practices will improve the quality \nand quantity of select commodities by reducing their moisture content to prevent microorganism \ndevelopment and production of aflatoxins causing food safety hazards, thereby resulting in higher \nmarket prices. It will require timely and seamless handling of harvest, drying, and storage of \nfarmers\u2019 produce. Using mechanized technologies can largely help small farmers address such \nchallenges. \n \n11.  Output  2:  Information  and  communication  technology-based  direct  marketing \nplatform developed and installed. The output will support small farmers\u2019 participation in direct \nmarketing, using a web-based electronic platform supported by ICT.16 This platform is a new \nmarketing channel proposed by the PAD and approved by the provincial government in 2018. In \nPunjab, agriculture commodities are, in principle, brought to and auctioned at agricultural markets, \nthe majority of which are regulated by the provincial government.17 Small farmers, however, have \nnot benefited from the current marketing practices  because of the lack of transparency in \nauctioning, and the overwhelming presence and role of middlemen who control small farmers\u2019 \n                                                \n13 Government of Punjab, Punjab Agriculture Department. 2018. Punjab Agriculture Policy 2018. Lahore. \n14 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n15 The project will work with a group of small farmers who live in selected pilot sites; it will not use a cooperative \napproach, as this is not a practice in rural Punjab. \n16 A new direct marketing platform will be built, installed, and accessed through a website provided by an independent \nweb service provider. The platform will be owned and managed by the TA during its implementation. Its ownership \nand administration will be handed over to the PAD at the end of the TA implementation. \n17 M.A. Rana. 2018. Commissions and Omissions: Agricultural Produce Markets in Pakistan.

There are 262 agricultural markets in Punjab. \n \n ", "4 \nmarketing.18 The proposed farmers\u2019 direct marketing will address such issues by allowing farmers \nto sell their produce directly to any buyer outside of the existing agricultural markets.19 It will give \nfarmers an opportunity to sell their produce at better prices if innovative technologies such as an \nICT-based online trading application and its operating system are available for farmers to use and \ndirectly connect them to buyers.20 \n  \n12.  Output  3:  Capacity  of  stakeholders  in  developing  and  adopting  advanced \ntechnologies increased. The TA will assist in the capacity building of key stakeholders through \nworkshops, seminars, and training programs to develop and adopt appropriate technologies for \nthe achievements of outputs 1 and 2.21 The stakeholders include government agencies, farmers, \nprivate service providers and machine manufacturers, and researchers. Output 3 will also support \ninternational  and  national  short  training  courses  for  the  researchers  and  experts  who  will \nexclusively conduct research and development on the rapid adoption of technologies for Punjab\u2019s \nagriculture value chain improvement. Such training courses will be held at or organized by the \nInternational Rice Research Institute, the International Food and Policy Research Institute, and/or \nother suitable international research centers. The TA will prepare various knowledge products to \ndisseminate the results achieved under the TA and publish them for internal as well as external \nstakeholders. \n \n13.  Output  4:  Investment  opportunities  to  scale  up  the  adoption  of  technologies \nformulated. The successful results of pilot testing carried out in outputs 1 and 2 need to be scaled \nup through both public and private sector investments for a further improved agriculture value \nchain with promising business opportunities for private entrepreneurs in Punjab. Output 4 will \nsupport the PAD in preparing short-, medium-, and long-term investment plans, and priority \nprogram and/or project concept notes. The TA will carry out a socioeconomic survey for baseline \nand end-line information of the TA pilot and demonstration component. In addition, studies on \nsustainable agriculture management and improved value chains will be conducted to identify \npotential  investment  opportunities  in  the  province\u2019s  agriculture  sector.22 The  results  of  the \nsocioeconomic survey and the studies will be used to formulate an investment plan and to design \nconcepts for priority programs and/or projects. \n \n14.  Innovation,  lessons,  and  ADB\u2019s  value  addition.  The  TA  will  promote  innovative \nsolutions to mainstream the use of advanced technologies to support the improved livelihood of \nsmall farmers in the rural communities of Punjab. To achieve its objectives, the TA will build upon \nthe results and lessons from the Basmati TA, which was successfully implemented to promote \nadvanced technologies for Punjab\u2019s basmati rice value chain, and from other ADB-financed \n                                                \n18 It would be beneficial to conduct a study to identify feasible approaches and models to provide small farmers with \nsustainable financial support, which is a root cause of the issue. The TA may carry out such a study under output 4. \n19 Government of Punjab. 2018. The Punjab Agricultural Marketing Regulatory Authority Act 2018 (Act XXIX of 2018). \nLahore. \n20 Many ICT-based agriculture information applications have been developed and operated in Pakistan. However, none \nof them are intended for farmers\u2019 direct marketing, as this innovative approach was very recently introduced by the \nGovernment of Punjab. \n21 Women in landholding farming families in the TA pilot areas are encouraged to participate in various training activities \nunder the TA, although they traditionally do not work in the fields and are mainly involved in livestock and/or \nhousehold work. The empowerment of women from landless farming families in rural communities will be included \nin capacity building activities. \n22 These will include the following studies: investment in agriculture value chain research and development in Punjab, \ninvestment in services industries for the agriculture value chain, and technology-based agriculture and its impact on \nthe livelihood of the most vulnerable rural communities in Punjab. In addition, a study on enhancement of climate-\nresilient agriculture for climate change adaptation and/or mitigation investment will be conducted, if required.  \n \n ", "5 \nprojects.23 The TA will offer integrated solutions to address a mixed range of challenges through \na \u201cOne ADB\u201d approach that applies sharing of cross-cutting knowledge and innovations. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.   The TA is estimated to cost $2,750,000, of which (i) $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-6) and (ii) $2,000,000 will be financed \non a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) and administered by ADB. The \nkey expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. \n \n16.   ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  will  support  various  activities  including \nconsulting services and pilot testing (Appendix 2). Knowledge sharing and capacity development \nactivities under output 3 will be solely financed by ADB. Such activities will include international \nand national short training programs to strengthen the agriculture sector\u2019s capabilities to develop \nand adopt advanced technologies, and the preparation of knowledge products to disseminate the \nadvanced technologies piloted in the TA. The JFPR will support activities related to outputs 1, 2, \nand 4 that will be implemented by TA consultants, including workshops and training for farmers. \n \n17.   The  government  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  staff,  office \naccommodation,24 data and information access, secretarial assistance, domestic transportation \nfor counterpart staff, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.   ADB will administer the TA, and will select, supervise, and evaluate consultants. The PAD \nwill be the executing agency for the TA.25 Its Agriculture Delivery Unit will be the focal point, \ncoordinating relevant directorates of the PAD. At the TA inception stage, a TA advisory committee \nwill be established among the directorates of the PAD for effective coordination to enable \nimproved information and knowledge sharing related to TA activities and achievements. The TA \nadvisory committee will be led by the PAD\u2019s Monitoring and Evaluation Cell and the Agriculture \nDelivery Unit and will meet during every ADB TA review mission on behalf of the PAD to provide \noverall guidance to the TA implementation. \n \n19.   The implementation arrangements are summarized in the table. \n                                                \n23 ADB.

Regional: Improving Poor \nFamers\u2019 Livelihood through Post-Harvest Technologies. \n24 The government will provide main office accommodation in the premises of the PAD, Lahore.  \n25 The PAD has experience in implementing investment projects financed by key development partners (ADB, the \nJapan International Cooperation Agency, the United States Agency for International Development, and the World \nBank). The PAD successfully supervised the Basmati TA through its substitute agency, the Punjab Agricultural \nResearch Board, wherein pilot testing and demonstration activities of advanced technologies and innovation in seed \ndevelopment and farming practices were undertaken. During implementation of the Basmati TA, the PAD, through \nthe Punjab Agricultural Research Board, demonstrated good ownership, and coordinated with relevant stakeholders, \nincluding the private sector. Thus, the PAD has adequate financial and human resources capacity to administer the \nTA during its implementation, and to deal with the proposed advanced technologies beyond its completion.
