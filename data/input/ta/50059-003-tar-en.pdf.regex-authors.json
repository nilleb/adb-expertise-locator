The proposed project will complete the reinforcement and modernization of supply in and \naround  Kathmandu  in  Bagmati  Province.  The  project  will  also  strengthen  evacuation  and \ntransmission of hydropower generation to the main load center in Kathmandu and to other load \ncenters, with excess power traded with neighboring countries. Further, the project will begin \nstrengthening distribution systems outside of Kathmandu in a systematic and phased manner \nstarting with the Bharatpur Metropolitan area of Chitwan district in Bagmati Province and Pokhara \nof Kaski district in Gandaki Province, where supply interruptions are frequent and prolonged. The \nproject will also support Province 2 where the quality of electricity supply is poor and about 20% \nof households are still without access to the national grid. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n2.  The transaction technical assistance (TA) will provide wide-ranging support to Nepal\u2019s \nenergy sector. It will assist the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) to (i) implement large-scale \nelectricity  supply  projects,  prepare  regulatory  submissions,  manage  projects,  and  improve \nfinancial  management  practices;  (ii)  implement  and  comply  with  environmental  and  social \nsafeguards; and (iii) institutionalize gender equality and social inclusion (GESI). The TA will also \nsupport  the  Electricity Regulatory  Commission  (ERC);  NEA; the Ministry  of  Energy, Water \nResources and Irrigation; and Department of Electricity Development implement sector reforms.1             \n \n3.  The TA aims to ensure that the energy resources and services to be provided under the \nproposed loan will effectively reach and benefit poor and vulnerable households, including poor \nwomen of different social groups. The TA will help implement the approved GESI implementation \nstrategy, guidelines, and manuals, and strengthen the technical capacity of NEA and its staff to \naddress these aspects within NEA. It will also support identification of poor and disadvantaged \nhouseholds having difficulties to get electricity connection and identify modality to support them. \nIt will also help enhance the skills of women and the disadvantaged in Province 2 to access new \nemployment and business opportunities in new and existing energy-based enterprises including \npossible shift toward electric vehicle and charging infrastructure for public and private use. The \nsupport to strengthen ERC and NEA to create enabling regulatory environment is crucial for the \nsector development.  NEA has many capacity building needs, and the TA will focus on building a \nsustainable skills development framework within NEA in addition to addressing urgent training \nneeds, including construction supervision and monitoring. Capacity building support for relevant \nstaff of the Ministry of Energy, Water Resources and Irrigation and Department of Electricity \nDevelopment will also be provided.  \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n4.  Output 1: Capacity of Nepal Electricity Authority to implement environmental and \nsocial safeguards strengthened. Key activities will include the following: \n \n(i)  provide training for NEA staff on Asian Development Bank (ADB) safeguard \nrequirements,  including  comparative  analysis  of  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009) and Nepalese safeguard frameworks and country systems; and \n \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of the website of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) on \n8 October 2019. \n ", "2 \n(ii)  provide  support  for  project  preparation  of  safeguards  documents  and \nimplementation of safeguard commitments. \n \n5.

Output 3: Capacity of women, the poor, and the marginalized to efficiently and \nproductively use electricity increased. Key activities will include the following:  \n \n(i)  conduct surveys to identify opportunities for energy-based enterprises, identify \ncapacity needs through target group and family and community gatekeepers, and \ndevelop skills for employment in electricity-based businesses; \n(ii)  conduct business orientation training for at least 100 women and disadvantaged \ngroups, and provide skills training on electricity-based enterprises for at least 200 \nwomen and members of other disadvantaged groups; \n(iii)  develop project performance monitoring system to track project performance, \nincluding output and outcome indicators; and \n(iv)  promote  use  of  induction  cooking  in  at  least  three  community  rural  electric \ncooperatives of Province 2, and raise awareness about how to reduce electricity \nleakage, implement safety measures, and use efficient equipment. \n \n7.  Output  4:  Capacity  of  Nepal  Electricity  Authority  to  sustainably  execute  its \nfunctions as transmitter and distributor of electricity strengthened. There is an urgent need \nfor NEA to develop the skills, experience, and capabilities of all staff, encompassing construction \nsupervision  and  monitoring,  investment  planning  and  implementation,  asset  management, \nnetwork operations, new technologies, finance, accounting, and utility management. In addition, \nthe TA will also develop NEA\u2019s capacity to comply with ERC requirements. To support the \nsustainability of this capacity building, NEA\u2019s training center is the preferred vehicle through which \ntraining courses will be developed and delivered to staff, possibly through an association with an \ninternational training organization. The TA will also assist NEA and the government to develop an \nelectric vehicle charging infrastructure strategy. Key activities will include the following: \n \n(i)  conduct capacity building and training needs assessment for NEA, help develop \nannual training plans and training courses in areas including technical, finance and \naccounting, management and commercial (regulatory); and  \n(ii)  develop at least two distribution centers in Province 2 as model distribution centers \nfor planning, information collection and dissemination, and customer care.  \n \n8.  Output 5: Capacity of the Ministry of Energy, Water Resources and Irrigation, \nElectricity Regulatory Commission, Nepal Electricity Authority, and the Department of \nElectricity Development to perform regulatory functions strengthened. The key activities \nwould include the following: \n \n(i)  establish regulatory cell within NEA; \n ", "3 \n(ii)  collaborate with and support ERC in its role as the independent electricity regulator, \nresponsible for setting technical standards, determining tariffs, promoting and \nprotecting  competition,  monitoring  and  enforcing  compliance  with  laws  and \nregulations,  resolving  disputes  between  licensees,  protecting  the  interests  of \nconsumers, and ensuring the safety of workers and the public; and \n(iii)  provide support for training and capacity building of the relevant staff of Ministry of \nEnergy,  Water  Resources  and  Irrigation  and  Department  of  Electricity \nDevelopment.  \n \nC.
