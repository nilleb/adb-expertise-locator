The Government of Pakistan requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in early \n2004  to  provide  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  the  purpose  of  streamlining  procedures  to \nminimize delays at the start-up stage of development projects, improve project implementation, \nand facilitate the realization of expected outcomes and results of projects. It was agreed with the \nGovernment that the focus of this TA would be on addressing delays between the stages of \napproval  and  effectiveness  of  ADB  projects,  and  from  effectiveness  to  award  of  the  first \nsubstantive contract.  It was recognized, however, that measures introduced to address start-up \ndelays in ADB projects under this TA would also have broader relevance in addressing such \ndelays generally across all development projects. The concept paper for the TA was approved \non 9 September 2004.1  From 22 to 30 November 2004, an ADB Fact-Finding Mission held \ndiscussions  with  key  Government  counterparts  and  reached  an  understanding  with  the \nGovernment  on  the  TA  objectives,  scope,  components,  implementation,  financing \narrangements, and outline terms of reference.  \n \nII.   ISSUES \n2.  The economic performance of Pakistan has steadily improved during the past few years. \nGDP growth increased from 3.4% in the fiscal year (FY) 2002, to 5.4% in FY 2003 and 6.4% in \nFY2004. External debt liabilities decreased and foreign exchange reserves increased. With the \nimproved macroeconomic situation and increased fiscal space, the Government has a renewed \nemphasis on enhancing the scope of its development program and effective implementation of \ndevelopment projects in the various sectors of the economy \u2013 infrastructure, agriculture and \nrural development, social sectors, and others \u2013 to reduce the incidence of poverty. \n \n3.  ADB is one of Pakistan\u2019s largest development partners and has an ongoing portfolio of \n54 loans (42 projects) for a total of $4.6 billion in the country.  Under the Country Strategy and \nProgram Update (2005\u20132006), ADB has committed to provide close to $2 billion of development \nassistance for 23 loans to Pakistan.  The Government has agreed that there is a need to ensure \ntimely and effective implementation of ADB-assisted development projects for maximum returns \nand accrual of desired benefits from such projects. \n \n4.  The Government has placed heightened emphasis on improving the implementation of \ndevelopment projects and utilization of the Public Sector Development Program (PSDP).  The \nPlanning Commission has recently undertaken a series of measures to improve utilization of \nPSDP and strengthen monitoring and evaluation of development projects.  In this regard, ADB \nis providing assistance to the Planning Commission through a TA to develop a more effective \nmonitoring and evaluation system for development projects.2  ADB is also providing a separate \nTA  to  build  the  capacity  of  project  management  units  (PMUs)  for  improved  financial \nmanagement of development projects.3 \n \n5.  Significant  start-up  delays  in  development  projects  adversely  affect  achievement  of \nproject  goals,  contribute  to  cost-overruns,  increase  the  cost  of  borrowing  by  Government \n(commitment charges need to be paid on undisbursed amounts of Ordinary Capital Resources \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 29 September 2004. \n2  ADB. 2002.

With regard to approval of a loan \nand its effectiveness date, this phase can be split up into two sub-phases, that is, from loan \napproval to loan signing, and from loan signing to loan effectiveness. In a recent study, that \nestimated time taken for loan signing and effectivity for 10 selected ADB projects, it was found \nthat loan signing took place, on average, 8 months after approval, while loan effectiveness, on \naverage, was achieved in over 6 months after loan signing.4  Further substantial delays are \nencountered in the next phase, that is, between the loan effectiveness and start of actual \nimplementation, with the award of the first contract. The time taken for projects in Pakistan to \npass through these two stages has, in the past, averaged as much as 24 months. This TA is \nprimarily  concerned  with  investigating  causes  for  such  start-up  delays  and  proposing \nrecommendations and initiating measures to reduce such delays. \n \n6.   The time taken between loan approval and signing is significantly longer than what it \nshould be for such a routine operational procedure \u2013 which should normally be completed \nwithout delay.  The main cause of the delay is the delay in the authorization to sign the loan \nagreement by the federal Government, and project agreements by the concerned provincial \ngovernments for provincial loans. \n7.  Second, while the agreed upon period between loan signing and effectiveness is 90 \ndays, in practice, effectiveness occurs much later, in some cases as much as up to 12 months \nor more. Delays in this regard are caused by two factors.  First, there are delays in provision of \nthe standard legal opinions by the federal and provincial governments.  Further, the legal \nopinions that are provided are at times found unacceptable to ADB and have to be revised, \ncausing  further  delays.    The  second  cause  for  delayed  effectiveness  is  the  delay  in  the \nGovernment\u2019s compliance with other effectiveness conditions, such as those that relate to \nestablishment of project management units, appointment of project directors and other staff, as \nwell as other related conditions.  Among others, a main reason for this delay is the lack of funds \nto undertake recurrent expenditure relating to payment of salaries, etc. of staff appointed in the \nPMUs before loan effectiveness.  In this regard, there is need to ensure that loan effectiveness \nconditions are fully agreed between Government and ADB and are practical and achievable \nwithin the stipulated period for loan effectiveness. \n8.  Third, there are significant delays between loan effectiveness and award of first contract \nfor start of actual implementation.  One reason is that participation of executing agencies (EAs) \nin the planning and design phase of projects is often not adequate, as a result of which they do \nnot have full understanding of, and commitment to projects, and pay insufficient attention to \nadvance procurement actions in the processing stage and subsequent project implementation.  \nTo ensure full engagement of EAs throughout the project cycle, starting from loan processing, \nthe Government and ADB agreed in the Memorandum of Understanding of the 2003 Country \nPortfolio Review Mission (CPRM) to establish core project management units (CPMUs) at the \nloan fact-finding stage. It was agreed that staff of CPMUs would be responsible for participating \nat all stages of loan preparation including participating in loan fact-finding missions; preparation \nand approval of PC-Is prior to loan negotiations so that the current delays in the approval of \nthese documents is minimized; and preparation of draft invitation documents for recruitment of \nconsultants as well as draft prequalification and tender documents to minimize subsequent \ncommon  delays  in  consultant  recruitment  and  procurement.    The  CPMU  would  then  be \nconverted to a PMU following loan approval.  It was also agreed that the CPMUs would be \n                                                 \n4  ADB.  2004.

Another reason for the delay between loan effectiveness and award of first contract is \nthe lengthy procurement and consultant recruitment procedures of Government and ADB and \nthe need for EAs to obtain frequent Government and ADB approvals at different stages of the \nproject implementation cycle.  The often-complex procurement procedures are also not well \nunderstood by EAs and PMUs, especially in case of newly posted project staff. In this regard, \nthere is a need for a review of existing Government and ADB procurement and consultant \nrecruitment procedures.   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n10.  The goal of the TA is to reduce the current excessive delays in the start-up phase of \ndevelopment projects. The purpose of the TA is to assist the federal and provincial governments \nand  ADB  in  streamlining  procedures  and  operational  modalities  during  the  start-up  phase \nbetween loan approval and actual implementation of development projects.  \n \n \n11.  The outputs of the TA include (i) recommendations and an implementation plan for \nreducing start-up delays in projects from a diagnostic study on comprehensive identification \nreasons for such delays; (ii) systemic improvements in the Economic Affairs Division (EAD) and \nForeign Aid sections of provincial planning and development departments (P&DDs) to increase \ntheir effectiveness in addressing start-up delays in projects; and (iii) capacity building for EAD \nand the Foreign Aid Sections of the P&DDs to enable them to effectively monitor, facilitate, and \nfollow up with EAs and PMUs to reduce start-up delays in projects. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.  The TA will be implemented over 18 months, from March 2005 to August 2006, in two \nphases. In phase 1 (March\u2013June 2005 (4 months)) a comprehensive diagnostic study will be \ncarried out.  The study will identify key issues and factors causing delays in the start-up stage, \nand provide recommendations along with an implementation plan to reduce such delays.  The \nstudy will include a review of existing Government procedures for preparing and approving PC-I \nand  PC-II,  and  ADB\u2019s  procurement  and  consultant  recruitment  procedures  \u2013  as  well  as \noperational  procedures  of  other  development  partners,  particularly  the  World  Bank.    A \nworkshop will be conducted to share the results of the diagnostic study with all stakeholders.  \nSimultaneous to the diagnostic study, and in an effort to better understand issues related to \nstart-up delays, and to recommend appropriate changes and improvements in operational \npolicies and procedures in the implementation plan, a pilot activity will be carried out.  This will \ninvolve provision of support to EAD and provincial P&DDs to follow up and facilitate the start-up \nof loans approved in 2004 to minimize the time taken from loan approval to effectiveness and \naward of first contracts.  The pilot will also support EAD and provincial P&DDs to ensure the \nearliest award of first contracts for loans approved in 2002\u20132003 for which such contracts have \nnot yet been awarded. \n                                                 \n5  With regard to the establishment of the CPMUs, the Government has agreed to urgently resolve the outstanding  \nissue of the establishment of revolving funds that would finance the CPMUs before loan approval.   ", "4 \n13.  In phase II (July 2005 to August 2006 (14 months)), the recommendations for systemic \nimprovements and capacity building for EAD and the Foreign Aid sections of P&DDs coming out \nof the diagnostic study (and early lessons from the pilot activity) will be implemented.  This will \ninclude:  (i)  operationalizing  a  management  information  system  (MIS)  to  enable  EAD  and \nprovincial P&DDs to effectively monitor and follow up on start-up activities for projects;6 (ii) \nsupporting operationalizing and strengthening of CPMUs; (iii) producing a set of model project \nadministration manuals (PAMs) which are simple and user friendly; (iv) assisting ADB project \npreparation teams on project processing and advance procurement actions; and (v) conducting \nof  training  workshops  for  staff  of  EAD,  P&DD,  and  relevant  EAs  and  PMUs.      The  TA \nFramework is in Appendix 1. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $570,000 equivalent, comprising $95,000 in \nforeign exchange and $475,000 in local currency equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. ADB will provide $450,000 equivalent, which will cover the \nentire  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $355,000  equivalent  of  the  local  currency  cost.  The \nGovernment will finance the remaining local currency cost of $120,000 equivalent in kind. \nDetails of cost estimates are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  The Executing Agency for the TA will be EAD which will be responsible for undertaking \nproject activities at the federal level and coordinating with the concerned federal and provincial \ngovernment departments and other stakeholders as required. EAD will appoint an officer of the \nlevel of Joint Secretary as TA manager supported by two staff members from EAD (ADB unit), \nand notify a TA Steering Committee headed by Secretary EAD with members from the Planning \nCommission, Ministry of Law and Justice, and provincial P&DDs.  The TA manager will act as \nthe secretary of the TA Steering Committee. The respective provincial P&DDs will be the \nimplementing agencies for the TA and will be responsible for undertaking and coordinating TA \nactivities at the provincial level. The Chiefs of Foreign Aid sections in the provincial P&DDs will \nbe the focal points for the TA at the provincial level, and will be assisted by two staff members of \nthe respective sections. Counterpart staff associated with the TA will perform their functions side \nby side with their routine official responsibilities. \n \n16.  The consulting services for the TA total 54 person-months: 51 for domestic consultants \nand 3 for international consultant.  The domestic consultancy component will comprise 18 \nperson-months for the team leader, 28 person-months for short-term specialists, and 5 person-\nmonths  for  a  MIS/software  specialist.  The  team  leader  will  have  experience  in  project \nmanagement,  public  sector  planning  and  developmental  management  as  well  as  capacity \nbuilding and procurement.  There will be 4 short-term specialists, one in each province.  The \nspecialists will have experience in project management, institutional development and capacity \nbuilding, and procurement. The MIS/software specialist will have experience in developing and \noperationalizing project management software systems.  The international consultant will have \nexperience  in  project  management,  institutional  development  and  capacity  building,  and \nprocurement.  ADB will engage individual consultants in accordance with its Guidelines on the \n                                                 \n6  To the extent possible, it will be ensured that the proposed MIS is an extension of the system established under TA \n3982 (footnote 2), and not a new system in itself.  The system to be operationalized will not be specific to ADB \nprojects only, but could be used for monitoring start-up activities in all development projects.  Furthermore, to \nensure that sufficient capacity exists in the executing and implementing agencies in the use of the MIS, a specific \ntask of the MIS expert to be recruited under the TA would be to provide thorough training on the MIS to relevant \nEAD and P&DDs.   ", "5 \nuse of Consultants by ADB and its Borrowers and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for \nengaging domestic consultants.  Recruiting individual consultants is proposed to ensure that \nneeded flexibility is available to ADB to recruit the best available and experienced consultants. \nThe outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n17.  The consultants will prepare (i) an inception report 3 weeks after the start of the TA for \ndiscussion  by  the  TA  Steering  Committee;  (ii)  prepare  quarterly  progress  reports  to  be \nsubmitted to the TA Steering Committee; and (iii) a final report after the conclusion of consulting \nservices.  Copies of all reports will also be submitted to ADB. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $450,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government
