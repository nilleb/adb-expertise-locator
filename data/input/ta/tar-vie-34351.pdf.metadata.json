During the 2002 Country Programming Mission, the Government confirmed its request to \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Agriculture  Sector \nDevelopment Support.1 The TA Fact-Finding Mission visited Viet Nam in June 2002 and held \ndiscussions with stakeholders, including officials of relevant government and aid agencies, \nnongovernment  organizations,  and  potential  beneficiaries.  The  Mission  reached  an \nunderstanding with the Government on the objectives, scope, cost estimates, financing plan, \nimplementation arrangements, and terms of reference for consulting services. The TA is in line \nwith ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program for Viet Nam. It is included in ADB\u2019s 2003 TA \nprogram for Viet Nam. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Sustainable growth of the agriculture sector is a prerequisite for economic growth and \npoverty reduction in Viet Nam. The sector plays a dominant role in the country\u2019s economy, since \nit accounts for about 24% of gross domestic product, 70% of employment, and 23% of export \nvalue. Although these shares will decline over the coming years, as they have done over the \npast decade, agriculture will remain at the core of the Vietnamese economy for the next decade. \nThe agriculture sector in Viet Nam has grown rapidly by any measure. During 1990-2000, the \nvalue of agricultural output grew by an average of 4.2% per annum, considerably higher than \nthe average for other Asian countries except the People\u2019s Republic of China. From a net \nimporter of rice in the late 1980s, Viet Nam has become the second largest rice exporter in the \nworld. Viet Nam also exports large quantities of coffee, rubber, tea, black pepper, groundnut, \nand cashew. The value of agricultural exports grew at over 13% per year from 1990 to 1998. \n \n3.  Despite  the  progress  made  in  agricultural  production  and  export  growth,  and  in \nliberalizing commodity, land, and credit markets in recent years, rural poverty remains high \n(estimated at 45%), and the role of the private sector in marketing remains small. Growth in the \npast was the result of (i) reliance on higher input use (labor, land, fertilizer, tractors, and \nirrigation); (ii) policy reforms in land, markets, and trade; and (iii) high public investment, mainly \nin the forms of irrigation and roads. It is unlikely, however, that this strategy will be able to \nsustain growth in the future because (i) the potential for expansion of the rural labor force and \nland under cultivation is limited; (ii) new investment in irrigation exhibits decreasing marginal \nreturns, as the stock of irrigation capital is already very high and requires increased operation \nand maintenance expenditure rather than new expansion; and (iii) rice export revenues are \ndeclining. Future agricultural growth will have to come from the increasing demand for high-\nvalue  and  value-added  products.  This  will  require  a  new  policy  environment  with  greater \ndiversification of crops and value addition through processing, and shifting the focus from \nproduction volume to value. Policy reforms that promote competition, diversification, and more \neffective use of science and technology are required. Some of the major factors contributing to \nlow agricultural diversification include (i) low investment in and poor effectiveness of research \nand extension, (ii) limited access to high quality genetic material, and (iii) limited access to \nfinancial services and market information. \n \n4.  Recently, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) has approved a \nstrategy for a 10-year development plan in the agriculture and rural development sector (2001-\n2010).  The  strategy  aims  at  achieving  a  sustainable,  highly  efficient,  diversified,  and \ninternationally competitive agriculture sector. It involves a vigorous push to diversify agricultural \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet Version) in July 2002. ", "2  \nproduction based on the comparative advantages of different regions involving the participation \nof all sectors, including the state, cooperatives, households, and the private sector. It will make \nuse of new and high technologies. Under the plan, a key role is assigned to scientific research, \nthe application of new technology in rural development, and promotion of small- and medium-\nsized enterprises (SMEs) in the agroindustry subsector. \n \n5.  Under  the  ADB-funded  Agriculture  Sector  Development  Program  (ASDP),2  the \nGovernment has agreed to carry out policy and institutional reforms in the agriculture sector in \nline with its new strategy in the agriculture and rural development sector. The reforms include (i) \nstreamlining, consolidating, restructuring, and strengthening of agricultural research institutes \nand  centers  under  MARD;  (ii)  reorienting,  restructuring,  and  strengthening  of  agricultural \nextension in the public sector; (iii) promotion of agroindustry development through institutional \nand policy reforms in the Vietnam Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (VBARD), and \nprovision of credit to SMEs in the agroindustry sector; (iv) provision of agricultural market \ninformation and forecasting to farmers, SMEs, market agents, and policy makers; and (v) \nphase-out of hybrid seed subsidies. \n \n6.  Agricultural research is characterized by fragmentation of effort. Research institutes, \ncenters, and universities are concentrated in the Red River and Mekong River deltas, with \ninsufficient representation in other agroecological zones. There is poor coordination among \nresearch  institutions,  weak  linkages  with  extension,  a  shortage  of  sufficiently  qualified \nresearchers and extension agents, poorly maintained research infrastructure and equipment, \nand insufficient involvement of stakeholders. Research institutions have not yet reacted flexibly \nto market needs. Current government policy has not provided enough incentives to researchers, \nand they have major financing needs. The importance of research is mentioned in several \nplaces in the MARD Master Plan for Agricultural Research in Viet Nam,3 and examples of \nsuccess and failure are cited in the appendix. The elements that are important to success \ninclude  careful  allocation  of  funds  and  regular  impartial  review  of  results.  This  subject  is \nespecially important when a wide range of institutions are to be brought together to work \ntowards a common goal while retaining a high degree of autonomy and independence. \n \n7.  The Government has requested TA to help MARD and VBARD in strengthening their \ncapacity to carry out policy and institutional reforms under the ASDP. Although the Government \nhas had considerable experience in implementing policy and institutional reforms under the \ncompleted  Agriculture  Sector  Program,4  there  are  a  number  of  reasons  why  a  significant \nadditional input of expertise in the structure of national research systems is needed at this time. \nForemost are the sweeping structural changes proposed. Options include phasing out a number \nof existing institutions, adding several new ones, converting existing institutions into regional \ncenters to deal with farming systems of different agroclimatic zones, and defining functions and \nresponsibilities of each of the institutes and centers. At the same time, there is a need to \nprioritize agricultural research, establish performance-based evaluation procedures for research \nstaff, and develop appropriate systems of governance that will permit considerable autonomy to \nthe institutes, yet assure that all work to realize national goals. Changes in extension are less \nsweeping but include developing strategies and priorities in extension; strengthening linkages \nwith  agricultural  research;  redirecting  training  of  staff  towards  participatory  methodology; \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2002.

Promotion of \nagroindustry SMEs will include measures to develop and expand MARD\u2019s market information \nsystem and VBARD\u2019s loan program for SMEs. The scope and magnitude of the subjects to be \ndealt with under the ASDP is such that the TA requested by MARD and VBARD could be critical \nto success. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n8.  The goals of the TA are to increase agricultural productivity and competitiveness. The \nimmediate purpose is to increase the capacity of MARD and VBARD to implement, sequence, \nand monitor policy reform actions under the ASDP (see TA Framework in Appendix 1). \n \n9.  The outputs of the TA include the following: \n \n(i)  Strengthening of agricultural research. The TA will increase the capacity of \nMARD  to  streamline,  consolidate,  restructure,  and  strengthen  the  existing \nagricultural research institutes and centers as outlined in the ASDP. This will \ninclude  defining  functions  and  responsibilities  of  the  research  institutes \naccording  to  the  second-tranche  requirements,  establishing  standards  and \nperformance-based  evaluation  procedures  for  institute  staff,  and  prioritizing \nagricultural research. Specifically, the consultants will produce a draft plan for \nthe  restructuring  of  agricultural  research,  based  on  lessons  learned  from \nsuccessful research restructuring in  other countries, that prioritizes research \nusing more adaptive, on-farm, and participatory methods. A draft staff training \nplan will also be prepared. \n \n(ii)  Strengthening of agricultural extension. The TA will increase the capacity of \nMARD to reorient, restructure, and strengthen the extension system at the \ncentral, provincial, district, and commune levels through institutional and policy \nreforms. They will help MARD (i) develop extension strategies and priorities; (ii) \ndevelop procedures to strengthen links between research and extension; (iii) \nredirect training as regards methodology, marketing, and postharvest activities; \nand (iv) expand provision of extension services at the district and commune \nlevels,  as  included  in  the  second-tranche  provisions.  Specifically,  the \nconsultants will produce a draft plan to restructure agricultural extension that \nadopts participatory and group-based approaches to benefit farmers, SMEs, and \nother clients more effectively. \n \n(iii)  Strengthening of agricultural market information. The TA will increase the \ncapacities of MARD to provide agricultural market information and forecasting to \nfarmers, SMEs, market agents, traders, and policy makers. \n \n(iv)  Strengthening VBARD\u2019s credit delivery to agroindustry SMEs. The TA will \nincrease the capacity of VBARD to lend to private sector agroindustry SMEs. \nThe consultants will work with ongoing projects that provide technical support to \nSMEs in Viet Nam, including (a) the ADB-financed Rural Enterprise Finance ", "4  \nProject,5 which includes a rural  business center support component; (b) the \nWorld  Bank-supported  Second  Rural  Credit  Project;  and  (c)  the  German \nTechnical Agency-supported Promotion of Investment for SMEs. \n \n(v)  Program planning and coordination. The TA will assist MARD and VBARD to \nmonitor and coordinate the implementation of the first-tranche conditions of \nASDP and complete the second-tranche conditions in close coordination with \nthe Program and Project Directors for the program or policy loan and the project \ninvestment loan of the ASDP. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The activities under the TA will be focused on (i) assisting MARD to successfully \nimplement the policy reform measures specified in the agreements for the ASDP, with a focus \non the second-tranche conditions; and (ii) assisting VBARD to implement its policy to increase \nthe provision of financial services to private sector agro-industry SMEs. Regarding agricultural \nresearch, the TA consultants will (i) prepare a draft plan for further restructuring of research; (ii) \nassist MARD in identifying research priorities for the next 5 and 10 years, phase out commercial \nactivities, and increase the autonomy of research institutes and centers; and (iii) assist MARD in \npreparing a human resource plan and research budget for 2004. In the area of agricultural \nextension, the TA will assist MARD and the provincial governments in  (i) establishing provincial \nextension  advisory  councils;  and  (ii)  restructuring  extension  to  adopt  a  group-based and \nparticipatory methodology, expanding services to new communes, and improving the targeting \nof women and ethnic minorities. \n \n11.  Important activities to promote market information include assisting MARD to establish \nagricultural price and market information systems in at least 10 provinces. The TA will help \nMARD and the provincial governments phase out hybrid rice seed subsidies for commercial sale \nin the market. MARD will also be assisted in (i) planning, coordinating, and monitoring policy \nreform measures; (ii) identifying implementation problems; and (iii) proposing solutions. \n \n12.  VBARD will be assisted in (i) expanding its lending and other financial services to agro-\nindustry SMEs, analyzing loan applications, and assessing projects and business plans; and (ii) \nmonitoring and evaluating lending and loan recovery operations for SMEs. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $750,000 equivalent, comprising $430,000 in \nforeign  exchange  and  $320,000  equivalent  in  local  currency  costs  (Appendix  2).  The \nGovernment has requested ADB to finance $600,000 equivalent, including the entire foreign \nexchange cost and $170,000 equivalent of the local currency costs. The TA will be financed on \na grant basis from the Government of Denmark. The Government of Viet Nam will finance the \nbalance  of  $150,000  equivalent  in  local  currency  costs  to  cover  staff  salaries,  office \naccommodation, and local transport. \n \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2000.

Implementation Arrangements \n14.  There will be two Executing Agencies for the TA: (i) MARD for the outputs relating to \nagricultural research, extension, market information, and program planning; and (ii) VBARD for \nthe output relating to agroindustry SMEs. MARD will coordinate with the Ministry of Finance, the \nMinistry of Planning and Investment, and the State Bank of Vietnam on the implementation of \nthe TA. The existing Program Implementation Unit in MARD and the Project Implementation \nUnit in VBARD created under the ASDP will be responsible for day-to-day implementation of the \nTA. These implementation units will submit quarterly reports to ADB, MARD, and VBARD on the \nprogress and issues relating to TA implementation. \n \n15.  The TA will be implemented over a period of about 12 months commencing in June \n2003, with completion expected in June 2004. It will be implemented in two packages: (i) \nsupport for policy advice, agricultural research and extension, market information, and training; \nand (ii) agribusiness credit support. The consulting services for the first package will comprise \n14  person-months  of  international  and  19  person-months  of  domestic  consultants.  The \nconsulting services for the second package (2 person-months  international  and  7  person-\nmonths domestic) will be selected through individual recruitment. The estimated cost of the first \npackage is $528,000, and of the second package, $72,000. Consultant selection will be in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements on the \nengagement of domestic consultants satisfactory to ADB. The terms of reference are provided \nin Appendix 3. \n \n16.  All equipment will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. It \nis planned that a study tour will be conducted to allow key Government staff to observe \nsuccessful  implementation  of  agricultural  research  restructuring  in  a  nearby  country.  The \nfollowing reports will be produced by the consultants for the first package: (i) an inception report \nby the end of the first month, (ii) an interim progress report 3 months after the submission of the \ninception report, (iii) a draft final report by the end of the 8th month, and (iv) a final report upon \ncompletion of the TA. The consultants for the second package will produce individual reports 1 \nmonth after starting work and at the end of their assignments. ADB will set up a TA project team \n(including staff of the Viet Nam Resident Mission) to support and monitor the implementation of \nthe TA. The ADB project team will monitor TA progress through review missions. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance to the Government of Viet Nam in an amount not exceeding \nthe equivalent of $600,000 to be financed by the Government of Denmark on a grant basis for \nAgriculture Sector Development Support, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign Summary  Performance Targets  Monitoring  Assumptions and \nMechanism  Risks \nGoals/Sector Impacts       \nIncreased agricultural productivity  \u2022 Contribute, through  \u2022 Program  \u2022 Effective \nand profitability  technology advances, to the  monitoring  implementation of \n  Government\u2019s annual sector  system at  policy and institutional \n  growth rate of 4.5%.
