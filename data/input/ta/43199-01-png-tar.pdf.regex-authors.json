INTRODUCTION \n1.  In  early  2010,  the  Government  of  Papua  New  Guinea  (PNG)  requested  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) technical assistance (TA) to complete the implementation of the \nNational Public\u2013Private Partnership (PPP) Policy approved by the National Executive Council in \nDecember 2008. The policy calls for the enactment of a PPP law and establishment of a center \nto  facilitate  the  preparation,  evaluation,  transaction,  and  implementation  of  PPP  projects. \nGreater private investment in the provision of infrastructure services, through direct investment \nas well as through PPPs, is an integral part of the government\u2019s Development Strategic Plan, \n2010\u20132030 and Medium Term Development Plan, 2011\u20132015. It is also a central feature of the \napproach to supporting private sector development in ADB\u2019s PNG country partnership strategy, \n2011\u20132015.1  \n \n2.  A fact-finding mission in May 2010 resulted in a memorandum of understanding outlining \nthe  agreed  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  implementation  arrangements,  cost,  financing \narrangements, and terms of reference for the TA to be provided by ADB to the government's \nPPP program. The TA will build upon the work already supported by ADB in 2008\u20132010 to \ndevelop the PPP Policy, the legal and institutional framework for the future PPP program, and to \nprepare  the  state-owned  enterprise  (SOE)  sector  for  increased  competition.2 This  ongoing \nsupport has been instrumental in maintaining reform momentum. The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Despite  a  rich  resource  base  and  high  levels  of  external  assistance,  PNG  social \nindicators lie below those of other countries with similar income per capita levels, and the \ncountry is not expected to meet any of the Millennium Development Goals by 2015. SOEs \ncontinue to dominate the provision of power, water, sewerage, seaports, and airports, crowding \nout private sector investment and not achieving targets. Massive infrastructure investment is \nrequired to pave the way for sustained economic growth, and these requirements far outstrip \nPNG\u2019s fiscal resources, even with the advent of the Exxon Mobil-led PNG-Liquefied Natural Gas \n(LNG)  project.4 Even  if  all  the  additional  government  revenue  from  the  LNG  project  were \nallocated to infrastructure, this would not be enough to finance the country\u2019s investment needs.5 \nMoreover, it would not be prudent for the government of PNG to seek to finance all of its \ninfrastructure investments from internal resources, given the leverage, innovation, and efficiency \ngains that can be secured from PPP arrangements, where properly structured.   \n \n4.  The  government  recognizes  that  private  investment  is  critical  to  accelerating \ninfrastructure modernization, and has been working to open up selected sectors to increased \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2010. Papua New Guinea: Country Partnership Strategy, 2011\u20132015. Manila. \n2  ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to Papua New Guinea for Policies for Private Sector Development. Manila (TA \n4722-PNG, closed in December 2009); ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance for Private Sector Development Initiative. \nManila (TA 6353-REG); and ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance for Private Sector Development Initiative Phase II. \nManila (TA 7430-REG). \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB's website on 2 July 2010. \n4  This project is forecast to add 15%\u201320% to GDP during its 30-year life span, or to increase the annual gross \nnational income by about 9% after accounting for anticipated income outflows. Over the project lifespan, PNG is \nexpected to receive $5.6\u2013$7.5 billion in royalties, development taxes and equity dividends, in addition to corporate \ntax revenue. This would represent close to $200 million per year, or approximately 30% of PNG\u2019s average annual \ndevelopment expenditure budget. \n5  The LNG project has a construction period of 5 years, from 2010/11 to 2014/15. Production and exports are \nexpected to begin in the second half of 2014, with the first tax revenues and dividend flows falling in 2017.  \n ", "2  \ncompetition  and  to  establish  a  framework  to  facilitate  PPP  transactions.  The  government \nconsiders PPP transactions to be an important way of leveraging private capital and expertise \nand in some cases an alternative to full-scale privatization. While there is currently no legal \nobstacle to executing PPP transactions in PNG, the absence of a formal, transparent and \npredictable process for evaluating and processing PPP projects increases the risks and costs to \nprivate companies in what is already a high-cost business environment. A formal PPP process \nand program will reduce the risks of undue interference in the procurement process, facilitate \nthe effective allocation of risks, and demonstrate that the government is actively seeking private \ninvestment in the provision of infrastructure services.  \n \n5.  Important progress has been made to date on the PPP framework. This work, which was \nled by an interdepartmental task force and supported by ADB TA, resulted in a K1.5 million \nbudget allocation for the new PPP center in 2011 and the finalization of a PPP bill. It is \nanticipated that this bill will be considered by parliament in the second quarter of 2011. Once the \nlaw is adopted, the PPP center will become a legal entity and can lead the development of a \nPPP program. Its first year of operations will be critical in establishing the credibility of the PPP \nprogram. The center will require very active collaboration with line agencies preparing PPP \nconcepts, the Department of National Planning and Monitoring, and the Department of Treasury \nin building up its PPP financing and fiscal risk management capabilities. For the PPP program to \nbe a success, future private sector partners will need to see that the government has the \ncapacity to (i) identify and prepare bankable PPP projects, (ii) finance these projects, and (iii) \nserve as a viable PPP partner. \n \n6.  Previous efforts by the government to structure PPPs have had mixed results, largely \nbecause the allocation of risks has been poor. It is unclear whether this was a result of vested \ninterests or simply a lack of technical capacity in structuring PPPs, but it has underscored the \nimportance of establishing a robust project preparation and assessment process, integrating \nPPPs  into  the  government\u2019s  fiscal  risk  management  considerations,  and  structuring  a \nmechanism to support long-term financing commitments.   \n \n7.  The TA will facilitate private sector investment in infrastructure service provision in PNG \nthrough the development and implementation of a PPP program. To achieve this goal, the TA \nwill strengthen the capacity of the government to prepare, transact, and implement PPP projects.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The expected impact of the TA is greater private investment in infrastructure services in \nPNG. This will be measured by the increased private sector share of total PNG investment in \ninfrastructure.  \n \n9.  The TA outcome will be improved capacity of the government to prepare and transact \nPPPs,  which  will  lend  credibility  to  the  PPP  program  and  create  opportunities  for  private \ninvestment  in  infrastructure.  By  the  end  of  the  TA,  the  PPP  center  will  have  conducted \nprefeasibility assessments of at least three proposed PPP projects, and the PPP steering group \nwill have endorsed recommendations received from the PPP center. \n \n ", "  3\nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will build on a previous TA that supported the preparation of a PPP law, design \nof the proposed PPP process, institutional arrangements and development of a preliminary PPP \npipeline.6 The TA will also build on an ongoing regional TA, which is developing a framework for \nthe  transparent  identification,  costing,  contracting  and  financing  of  community  service \nobligations (CSOs) delivered by SOEs.7 The TA will be implemented through the Department of \nTreasury, which will oversee the operations of the future PPP center.  \n \n11.  The  TA  will  have  four  interrelated  components:  (i)  support  for  the  PPP  center  in \npreparing a first set of pilot PPP transactions and establishing momentum and credibility in the \nPPP  program;  (ii)  support  for  the  development  of  financing  mechanisms  for  PPP  project \npreparation, through a project development facility (PDF); (iii) support for the development of \nmechanisms to secure long-term funding for the implementation of PPPs; and (iv) support for a \nCSO framework for PNG, allowing the private sector to compete for CSO contracts, and freeing \nup SOEs to adopt commercial practices, making them more viable partners for the private \nsector in future PPP transactions. \n \n12.  The government\u2019s 2011 budget allocation for the PPP center will finance its operations, \nincluding core staff and intermittent inputs from external consultants who will support the center \nin its first 18\u201324 months of operations. As the PPP center will be formally established once the \nPPP law is enacted by parliament, it is expected that the first year of operations will be 2011. \nThe  TA  will  assist  the  government  in  establishing  the  center  and  in  recruiting  technical \nspecialists, and will then focus on working alongside center staff and line agencies to raise \nawareness of how PPPs can be used to deliver sector outcomes. The TA will support the \npreparation of concept notes, the structuring of project teams, and the conduct of assessments. \nAs PPPs are relatively new to PNG, the TA will support a series of training courses for line \nagencies to illustrate how they can be used in their respective sectors, and work with them to \nidentify potential opportunities in their investment programs.   \n \n13.  Once PPP project concept notes have been approved for development, the sponsoring \nline agencies will need transaction advisors to prepare the business case, financing plans, and \ntransaction structures for the projects. The input of these transaction advisors is critical to the \ndevelopment of bankable PPP projects. In order to facilitate the recruitment and financing of \nthese transaction advisors, it is proposed that a PDF be created.8  Appendix 2 outlines the \nPDF\u2019s institutional framework and operational mechanisms. The PDF would be funded by the \ngovernment, and a budget allocation of K0.5 million has been made for 2011. The government \nintends to allocate a further K1.0 million per year for the PDF in 2012\u20132015. It is proposed that \nthe PDF be structured as a revolving fund, with the public sector's costs associated with project \npreparation and tendering reimbursed by the winning bidder upon transaction closure. This \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to Papua New Guinea for Policies for Private Sector Development. Manila (TA \n4722-PNG, closed in December 2009). \n7  ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance for Pacific Private Sector Development Initiative Phase II. Manila (TA 7430-\nREG).  \n8  The key benefits of structuring a PDF to finance PPP project preparation rather than using existing government \nprocesses in PNG are that the PDF will (i) increase transparency and efficiency in the procurement of advisors; \nand (ii) ensure that a sustainable funding source is available for PPP project preparation, as the PDF is to be \nstructured as a revolving fund. Transparency would be supported through the disclosure of technical evaluations of \nconsultant proposals (which is not currently the case through existing PNG procurement processes), while \nefficiency would be supported through the establishment of a prequalified panel of consultants. These consultants \nwould be selected on a competitive tender basis, and would then be mobilized as needed by the PPP center to \nsupport PPP project preparation. \n ", "4  \nrevolving  structure  would  make  the  PDF  financially  sustainable.  The  TA  would  assist  the \ngovernment  in  structuring  the  PDF  and  its  associated  management  processes.  Particular \nattention will be paid to applying the lessons learnt from the establishment of similar PDFs in \nIndonesia and India, with ADB support.   \n \n14.  The TA will also support the government in assessing options for developing secure \nsources of financing for PPP projects, including through the use of sovereign wealth funds. \nCurrently, project financing in PNG is dependent on the annual budget cycle, which allocates \nfunding to both development and recurrent expenditure. No mechanism exists to budget for or \nto secure longer-term payment obligations within the existing fiscal management framework.9 \nThe establishment of a long-term funding mechanism will be essential for reducing payment risk \nand therefore the cost of future PPP agreements. The TA will work with the government to \nassess options for developing secure sources of financing for PPP projects, in both the medium \nand longer terms.  \n \n15.  The fourth component of the TA will strengthen the capacity of SOEs to enter into PPP \narrangements  and  create  new  opportunities  for  the  private  sector  to  provide  infrastructure \nservices  previously  reserved  for  SOEs.  The  government  is  currently  developing  a  CSO \nframework for SOEs. The TA will support the implementation of this framework into the SOEs \nthat are most likely to become future PPP partners.  \n \n16.  Capacity-building efforts will be built into the TA to support the sustainability of the PPP \nprogram and the CSO framework, with close collaboration with line agencies, the PPP center, \nand SOEs piloting the CSO framework. At least three training courses will be conducted on PPP \nproject identification and preparation, as well as training for the PPP center on the PPP process \nand management of the PDF.  \n \n17.  The success of the TA will be contingent on the passage of the PPP bill in 2011 and \ncontinued government support and funding for the implementation of the PPP program. The \nmain risk is that the government\u2019s current reform commitment in support of increased private \nsector  participation  in  the  economy  and  reform  of  SOEs  will  lessen  in  the  context  of  the \nanticipated revenue flows from the LNG project. The ministers for treasury and finance, national \nplanning,  and  public  enterprises  have  publicly  stated  their  commitment  to  using  PPPs  to \naccelerate private investment in infrastructure, and it is expected that they will actively support \nthe proposed PPP legislation in Parliament. The key challenge in the TA will be to ensure that \nthe spirit of transparency and accountability that has been built into the PPP policy, bill and \ninstitutional arrangements is upheld by the PPP center and associated government departments.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1.6 million equivalent, of which $800,000 will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, funded by the Government \nof Japan. The Government of Papua New Guinea will provide support equivalent to $800,000.10 \nDetailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3. \n \n                                                 \n9   It should be noted that trust funds, which have been widely used in PNG to save windfall revenue for specific future \nexpenditure  needs,  have  to  date  been  managed  outside  the  government's  budgeting  framework,  thereby \nweakening fiscal policy control.  \n10  The government contribution will be a budget allocation to finance the operations of the PPP center and the PDF.  \n ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  The TA will be executed by ADB through the Pacific Liaison and Coordination Office in \ncoordination  with  the  Department  of  Treasury  of  Papua  New  Guinea,  which  will  be  the \nimplementing agency. The Department of Treasury will play an important role in establishing the \nPPP center and PDF and will serve as a co-chair of the CSO working group. In line with \ngovernment processes, the executing agency for the TA will be the Department of National \nPlanning and Monitoring. It is expected that the TA will begin in May 2011 and be implemented \nover a 24-month period. \n \n20.  Once the PPP law is enacted, the PPP center can be legally established. It is therefore \nanticipated that the first 8 months of the TA will be focused on supporting the establishment of \nthe PPP center, working closely with its chief executive officer and steering group to launch the \nPPP program. This work will include outreach efforts, refining the PPP process and developing \nthe architecture of the PDF. In subsequent phases of the TA, it is expected that the focus will be \non supporting the preparation of PPP projects.  In addition to direct work with the PPP program \nin the first 8 months of the TA, support will also be provided to pilot the CSO framework in \nselected SOEs. This work, which will be conducted in close collaboration with the PNG CSO \nworking group, will begin once the new CSO framework has been agreed by the National \nExecutive Council. It is currently anticipated that this approval will be secured in the third quarter \nof 2011.  \n \n21.  The TA team will be composed of technical specialists with expertise in PPP transaction \nstructuring,  program  development  and  financing,  fiscal  risk  management,  public  financial \nmanagement and CSO framework development and implementation. The sector expertise of \nthe consultants will be determined by the potential PPP transactions being prepared by the \ngovernment.  Detailed  terms  of  reference  for  the  consultants  will  be  developed  in  close \ncoordination  with  ADB\u2019s  Central  Operations  Services  Office.  Individual  consultants  will  be \nengaged  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  its  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2010,  as \namended from time to time). For the CSO component of the TA (i.e., the piloting of the CSO \nframework), which will require significant local knowledge and field presence, it is proposed that \nADB engage a PNG-based professional services firm. The firm will be hired based on quality-\nbased selection. It is anticipated that 1.5 person-months of international consultant time and 6 \nperson-months of national consultant time will be required for the CSO component of the TA.  It \nis estimated that the TA as a whole will require a total of 19.5 person-months of international \nconsultant time and 10 person-months of national consultant time. Disbursements under the TA \nwill be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as \namended from time to time). The outline terms of reference for consultants is in Appendix 4. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 to the Government \nof Papua New Guinea to be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction \nfor Facilitating Public\u2013Private Partnerships, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions and Risks  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms    \nImpact      Assumptions \n       \nIncreased private sector  Value of public\u2212private  PPP center annual report   Government commitment to \ninvestment in  partnerships in  as required by PPP law  implementing the public\u2013private \ninfrastructure services  infrastructure sector  partnership (PPP) program will \nincreases by at least $20  be maintained, with passage of \nmillion by end 2013    PPP bill in 2011. \n   \n  If properly structured, PPP \ntransactions in PNG will attract \nprivate investment. \n \nRisks \n \nPPP bill is not passed by \nParliament. \n \nPPP projects prepared by the \nPPP center are not bankable.  \n \nOutcome      Risks \n       \nImproved capacity of the   PPP center conducts  PPP center annual  PPP center will not be able to \ngovernment to prepare  prefeasibility  reports, as required by  attract skilled staff. \nand transact PPPs  assessments of at least  PPP law   \nthree proposed PPP    The government may try to \nprojects    circumvent PPP center \n    processes in selected \nPPP center advice    procurement scenarios. \nendorsed by PPP   \nsteering group \nOutputs       Assumptions \n       \n1.

Rationale.  Public\u2013private  partnership  (PPP)  transactions  are  complex,  and  their \npreparation requires specialized expertise. The proposed project development facility (PDF) \nwould provide funding for the engagement of transaction advisors to prepare and transact PPP \narrangements on behalf of the government. Many countries that have developed successful \nPPP programs have done so with support from PDF facilities, notably Brazil, India, Pakistan, \nand  South  Africa.  Where  these  facilities  have  not  been  available,  or  where  inadequate \nresources have been allocated for PPP project preparation, PPP programs have faltered, and, \nin some cases, projects have been transacted with insufficient risk transfer to the private sector, \nresulting in high costs to the public sector.  \n \n2.  By structuring a PDF to finance PPP project preparation rather than using existing \ngovernment processes, it is anticipated that (i) the recruitment of the advisors will be conducted \nmore efficiently and transparently,1 and (ii) the funds expended on project preparation will be \nmore easily recouped by the PPP center through a success fee upon transaction completion. In \nthis way, the project preparation funds can become sustainable.  \n \n3.  Proposed  structure.  The  detailed  structure  of  the  PDF  will  be  developed  by  the \ntechnical  assistance  (TA).  It  is  anticipated  that  the  TA  will  draw  from  the  experience  of \nsuccessful PDFs, most notably those in India and South Africa, in structuring the PDF for Papua \nNew Guinea (PNG). The broad operational principles of these PDFs are illustrated in the figure \nbelow. \n \nFigure A2: Illustrative Operational Arrangements for Project Development \nFacilities \n \nPPP = public\u2013private partnership. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n                                                 \n1  Transparency will be supported through the disclosure of technical evaluations of consultant proposals (which is \nnot currently the case through existing PNG procurement processes). \n ", "  Appendix 2  9 \n4.  The proposed PDF is to be structured as a separate fund managed by the PPP center \nand created in accordance with the Public Finances (Management) Act. PDF resources are to \nbe used exclusively to finance transaction advisors to work with PPP project teams to develop \nPPP projects. The role of the PPP center in this process would be: (i) to determine which \nprojects are eligible for PDF funding, (ii) to facilitate the contracting of transaction advisors \nfunded through the PDF, and (iii) to manage the recovery of PDF money expended once \nprojects are successfully transacted. Once contracted, transaction advisors would be managed \nby the PPP project teams and their sponsoring PNG government agency.  \n \n5.  While the PDF would be under the management control of the PPP center, it is proposed \nthat a financial management company be contracted by the PPP center to manage the PDF. \nThis will ensure robust financial management and administration of the PDF, as the mandate of \nthe  financial  management  company  will  be  to  create  an  environment  of  transparency, \naccountability, and efficiency in the use of PDF funds. The management company will prepare \nbiannual accounts for the Department of Treasury and quarterly reports for the PPP center.  \n \n6.  Accessing PDF funding. To facilitate the contracting of transaction advisors to prepare \nPPP  projects,  it  is  proposed  that  a  competitive  and  open  prequalification  process  be \nimplemented by the government, in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  This \nprequalification process will result in a shortlist of advisors that can then be engaged by the \ncenter on a project-by-project basis, with agreed terms of reference for each project.   \n \n7.  The PPP process, as described in the 2008 National PPP Policy and the draft PPP bill, \nhas specific project assessment and approval milestones which would trigger funding from the \nPDF for further project development. The first milestone would be the endorsement of a project \nconcept note by the PPP steering group and minister for treasury. This approval would qualify a \nproject to move to the next stage of project development, i.e., the business case stage, and to \naccess  PDF  funding  to  engage  transaction  advisors  to  prepare  the  business  case.  Once \ncompleted, the business case is presented to the PPP center for review and submission to the \nNational Executive Council, as a second milestone in securing PDF funding. If approved by the \nNational Executive Council, the project is then ready to be prepared for tender, and additional \nadvisors can be recruited to prepare the transaction, which will also be funded through the PDF.    \n \n8.  Replenishing the PDF fund. To ensure the sustainability of the PDF, funds expended \nin preparing PPP projects will be capitalized upon project transaction closure.  This can be done \nby adding the project preparation costs to the value of the project offered to the private sector \npartner. Upon transaction closure, the project preparation costs would then be refunded to the \nPDF, so that they can then be used to prepare the next set of projects.  All project preparation \naccounting would be the responsibility of the financial management company contracted to \noversee the PDF accounts.   \n \n9.  Size and funding.  The government has allocated $0.2 million to fund the PDF in its first \nyear, 2011. Subsequent allocations of $0.4 million will be sought in each of the following four \nyears 2012\u20132015, for a total allocation of $1.8 million.2 It is expected that this funding should be \nsufficient to prepare at least two PPP projects with a minimum value of $20.0 million each. \nDuring  the  first  two  years  of  the  PDF,  additional  funding  of  $0.2  million  for  PPP  project \npreparation will be provided through the TA. These funds will be managed by ADB, rather than \n                                                 \n2  The government\u2019s intention to seek funding for the PDF in 2012\u22122015 is confirmed in the PNG National Budget \n2011 document, Volume 3: Public Investment Program (2011\u20132015). \n ", "10  Appendix 2 \nthrough  the  PDF,  but  will  be  focused  on  supporting  PPP  transaction  preparation  in  close \ncollaboration  with  PDF-funded  advisors.  It  is  expected  that  the  initial  PPP  transactions \nsupported by the PDF will close within 36 months of the project concept approval, allowing the \nPDF to have a 36-month recovery cycle.  \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 3  11 \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($'000) \n \n  Total \nItem  Cost \nA.

The outline terms of reference for consultants describe the main tasks in each of the four \noutput categories of the proposed technical assistance (TA): (i) preparation of public\u2013private \npartnership (PPP) projects to the business case stage, (ii) training courses on PPP project \nidentification and preparation, (iii) establishment of a project development facility (PDF), and  \n(iv) piloting the new community service obligation (CSO) framework in selected state-owned \nenterprises (SOEs). The Pacific Liaison and Coordination Office of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) will coordinate the TA. The required areas of expertise for international and national \nexperts include PPP transaction structuring, institutional change, SOE reform, output-based aid, \nCSOs, and public financial management.  An outline of the broad terms of reference for each \noutput is presented below.  \n \nA.  Output 1:  Preparation of PPP Projects to the Business Case Stage (international, \n15.5 person-months; national, 2 person-months) \n2.  The PPP center is expected to be established by law and operational by the fourth \nquarter of 2011. One of its core activities in the first 12\u201318 months of its establishment will be to \nassess the first set of PPP project concept notes that will be submitted to it for review. The ADB \nTA will support this activity with consultants experienced in structuring PPPs in the sectors \nrelevant to the first proposals. They will work alongside PPP center staff and line agencies to \nhelp structure PPP project teams, organize the analysis, conduct the assessments, and draft \nrecommendations.  The  consultants  will  be  strong  team  players  and  have  excellent \ncommunication skills. Sector expertise will be required and will depend on the nature of the \ntransactions under preparation, which are likely to be in key infrastructure sectors such as \ntransport, power, water, and health.   \n \n3.  PPPs are relatively new to Papua New Guinea (PNG), and staff in line agencies, who \nwill originate PPP proposals, will need to be trained to deliver sector outcomes and to identify \npotential opportunities in their investment programs. The consultants will also support the line \nagencies to prepare PPP project concept notes and register their prospective projects with the \nPPP center.  International consultants will have graduate degrees in the areas of focus and at \nleast 15 years\u2019 professional experience in the selected sectors and areas of technical focus. \nExperience in PNG will be an advantage. National consultants will have at least 5 years\u2019 \nexperience working with government counterparts in PNG in the planning, structuring, and \nfinancing of public investment.  \n \nB.  Output 2:  Establishment of a PPP Project Development Facility (international, 1.5 \nperson-months; national, 1 person-month) \n4.  The TA will support the establishment of a PDF to finance transaction advisors to \nprepare PPP projects, under the management of the PPP center. It is anticipated that the PDF \nwill be modeled on those in a number of other countries, which are used to finance technical \nspecialists, or the variable costs associated with project preparation and tendering. The PDF is \nexpected to function as a revolving fund, with the public sector's costs associated with project \npreparation and tendering reimbursed by the winning bidder upon contract award. The TA will \nsupport  the  design  of  the  PDF,  including  the  development  of  policies  and  procedures  for \nprocuring consultants using the fund, and its initial operations. Consultants will have expertise \nand international experience in the design and use of PDF funds. International consultants will \nhave graduate degrees in the areas of focus and at least 10 years\u2019 professional experience in \nthe planning and implementation of PPP programs. National consultants will have at least 5 \n ", "Appendix 4  13 \nyears\u2019 experience working with government counterparts in PNG in public procurement and/or \nthe planning, structuring and financing of TA programs. \n \nC.  Output 3:  Development of Options for Long-Term Financing of PPP Projects \n(international, 1 person-month; national, 1 person-month) \n5.  The TA will support the government's efforts to structure financing mechanisms for future \nPPP  projects.  This  may  include  TA  to  the  Sovereign  Wealth  Fund  Working  Group,  the \nIndependent Public Business Corporation, the Department of Treasury, and other public bodies \ntasked with ensuring that future PPP projects can have access to secure, long-term sources of \nfunding for capital and operational costs. Consultants will review PNG\u2019s experience of using \ntrust funds and other mechanisms to set aside funding for specific sector needs, as well as the \nexperience  of  other  countries  in  establishing  infrastructure  funds  which  can  support  PPP \nprojects. Particular attention will be placed on developing fully transparent funding mechanisms \nthat are integrated into PNG's overall budgeting and fiscal framework. Consultants will have \nstrong public financial management expertise and international experience in the design and \nuse of PPP funds.  International consultants should have graduate degrees in the areas of focus \nand at least 10 years\u2019 professional experience in the planning and implementation of PPP and \npublic investment programs. Experience with structuring and management of sovereign wealth \nfunds will be an advantage. National consultants should have at least 5 years\u2019 experience \nworking with government counterparts in PNG in the planning, structuring and financing of \npublic investment. \n \nD.  Output 4:  Piloting the New Community Service Obligation Framework in Selected \nSOEs (international, 1.5 person-months; national, 6 person-months) \n6.  Many  SOEs  perform  community  services  for  which  they  may  or  may  not  receive \ncompensation from the government. In some cases, subsidies are given to compensate for \nservices  that  may  be  poorly  defined  and  rarely  measured.  Introducing  clarity  into  the \nidentification, costing and compensation of CSOs will be essential to improve the performance \nof SOEs and expand private sector participation. The consultants will provide support to the \ngovernment to implement the CSO policy and guidelines which are currently under development \nin PNG. These guidelines will provide for the identification, costing, contracting, financing and \nmonitoring of CSO delivery. The consultants will support the development of simple contracting \ntemplates for CSOs as well as monitoring mechanisms to ensure their implementation, and will \nsupport the departments of treasury, public enterprise, planning, and the Independent Public \nBusiness Corporation in their implementation. It is anticipated that a PNG-based professional \nfirm will be engaged to support the piloting of the CSO framework.  The firm should have a full-\ntime presence in PNG. Direct experience of working with SOEs will be an advantage.   \n \n \n \n \n "], "metadata": {"Author": "Asian Development Bank", "CreationDate": "D:20110224105356+11'00'", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2.2", "Keywords": "papua new guinea, png, adb project 43199, adb technical assistance, public-private partnerships, capacity developments, jfpr, japan fund for poverty reduction, public sector management, private sector development\r\n", "ModDate": "D:20110407163631+08'00'", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 7.0 (Windows)", "Subject": "Decision document for Facilitating Public-Private Partnerships in Papua New Guinea, presented to ADB\u2019s Board of Directors or Management for approval.", "Title": "Technical Assistance Report: Papua New Guinea: Facilitating Public-Private Partnerships"}, "author_page": " \nCURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of  17 February 2011) \nCurrency Unit \u2013  Kina (K) \nK1.00 =  $0.3859 \n$1.00 =  K2.5906 \n \nABBREVIATIONS \n \n  ADB  \u2013  Asian Development Bank \n  CSO  \u2013  community service obligation \n  LNG  \u2013  liquefied natural gas \n  PDF  \u2013  project development facility \n  PNG  \u2013  Papua New Guinea \n  PPP  \u2013  public\u2013private partnership \n  SOE  \u2013  state-owned enterprise \n  TA  \u2013  technical assistance \n \n \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CLASSIFICATION \n \nType  \u2013  Capacity development technical assistance (CDTA) \nTargeting classification  \u2013  General intervention  \nSector (subsector)  \u2013  Public sector management (economic  and  public affairs \nmanagement) \nThemes (subthemes)  \u2013  Private sector development (public\u2013private partnerships), \ngovernance (economic and financial governance), capacity \ndevelopment (institutional development) \nLocation (impact)  \u2013  National (high), regional (low), urban (medium), rural (medium) \nPartnership  \u2013  Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction \n \nNOTE \n \nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n \nVice-President  C.
