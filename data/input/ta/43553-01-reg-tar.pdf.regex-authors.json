INTRODUCTION \n1.  The impacts of disasters due to natural hazards are intensified by the vulnerability in  \ndeveloping countries, leading to patterns of impact that are often more frequent and more \nextensive than those experienced by developed nations.1 Meteorological variations and extreme \nweather events brought on by climate change seem destined to add to the adverse impacts of \nthese natural calamities in Asia and the Pacific. Geophysical catastrophes, while less frequent, \nare especially destructive in terms of lives lost and economic dislocation. The fact that natural \nhazards  pose  a  particularly  great  threat  to  urban  areas  raises  the  need  for  special  risk \nassessment techniques and tools. To be effective, disaster risk management (DRM) must shift \nfrom its current focus on post-disaster recovery and reconstruction toward an approach that \nbalances  proactive  risk  management  and  disaster  risk  finance  (DRF)  with  traditional  post-\ndisaster aid.  \n \n2.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) was the first multilateral development bank (MDB) \nto have a dedicated disaster policy.2 ADB\u2019s long commitment to DRM is reinforced in Strategy \n2020 with DRM, climate change adaptation (CCA), and risk financing identified as core areas of \noperations.3 Between 1987 and 2009, ADB contributed $9.69 billion to DRM activities through \n412 projects. ADB has also been studying opportunities for DRF within the region since 2005 \nand co-sponsored, with Japan\u2019s Ministry of Finance, the 2008 Tokyo Conference on Natural \nCatastrophe Risk Insurance Mechanisms for Asia and the Pacific.4 \n \n3.  DRF employs financial instruments to anticipate and plan for disasters and reduce and \ntransfer disaster risks. As developed by ADB and other MDBs, DRF includes insurance, disaster \nbudgeting and reserving, credit products, and capital market instruments to transfer disaster risk. \nThe importance of DRF is reflected in ADB\u2019s strategic climate change priorities.5  These call for \na focus on risk management through DRF and disaster risk reduction (DRR) investments as \npart of new solutions to reduce the impact of total climate risk due to both existing climate \nvulnerability and climate change.  \n \n4.  ADB is preparing to launch an integrated disaster risk management (IDRM) effort based \non three pillars: (i) DRF, (ii) DRR, and (iii) CCA. This TA supports initiatives in these areas to \ndevelop capacity in Indonesia and the Philippines to manage disaster risks at the national and \ncity levels more systematically, thereby expanding DRM capacity, reducing potential disaster \nimpacts, and enhancing climate resilience6 (Appendix 1). \n \nII.  ISSUES \n5.  Between 1975 and 2007, 37% of the world's recorded disasters due to natural hazards \noccurred in Asia, accounting for 57% of overall deaths, 89% of the population affected, and 45% \nof property and infrastructure damage.7 More recent data show that this concentration was also \npronounced in 2009, when 43% of the disasters worldwide happened in Asia, which was also \n                                                 \n1  World Bank. 2009.

Kobe (p. 2). \n ", "2   \nhome to 62% of all disaster victims globally.8 The fact that 77% of all disasters in Asia during \n1975\u20132007 were weather-related suggests that the onset of climate change will make the \ndevelopment of comprehensive climate risk management strategies even more important. 9 The \nPhilippines,  ranking  8th  worldwide  in  terms  of  disaster  incidence  and  human  impact,  and \nIndonesia, ranking 12th, are particularly disaster prone.10  \n \n6.  Several factors favor an urban focus for IDRM. Asia\u2019s cities are particularly vulnerable to \nboth  geophysical  and  weather-related  natural  hazards  and  have  distinct  DRM  issues  and \nchallenges. Given Asia\u2019s large and growing urban population and the extent to which economic \nactivity is increasingly urban-based, urban disaster management has become more urgent. \nMDBs and international aid organizations have so far focused largely on rural and national \ndisaster management, creating the need to consider the unique vulnerabilities, hazards, and \nexposures that Asia\u2019s cities manifest.  \n \n7.  Like the rest of the region, Indonesia and the Philippines have traditionally relied on \npost-disaster  assistance.  This  approach  carries  substantial  risks  in  timing,  targeting,  and \nopportunity costs.11 Low insurance penetration has raised the financial cost of past natural \ndisasters in Asia because disaster losses have been internalized by the economy and not \nspread to those better able to absorb them.12 The World Bank has estimated that the use of \nDRM tools and mechanisms, including insurance, can reduce the economic impacts of a natural \ndisaster by $7 for every $1 spent.13 \n \n8.  Widespread efforts by the international community to encourage the mainstreaming of \nDRM in development policy and programs were reflected in the Hyogo Framework for Action \n(HFA)14 in 2005. The HFA\u2019s main aim is to integrate DRM into development initiatives and \nemphasize proactive measures like DRR and DRF. The HFA\u2019s 10-year plan recognized that \npost-disaster funding is often poorly targeted, untimely, and unpredictable. Development of \ncommercial markets to help manage, insure, and underwrite catastrophe risk has enhanced the \neffectiveness of DRM and DRF instruments and mechanisms. Private sector participants in this \nmarket have developed new approaches to financing and spreading these risks, including \nreinsurance  products  and  capital  market  solutions  supported  by  insurance-linked  security \ntrading platforms.15 Commercial market participants, such as the Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance \nGroup, Munich Re, and Swiss Re have made clear they are prepared to partner with ADB to \ndevelop DRF solutions to disaster risk in the Asia and Pacific region. A vital part of ADB\u2019s IDRM \nefforts  will  be  to  develop  effective  public\u2013private  partnerships  (PPPs)  to  create  innovative \ndisaster risk financing solutions for developing member countries (DMCs).  \n \n9.  The World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) have been developing \nDRF expertise and resources for a number of years, the World Bank since the late 1990s and \nIDB since 2004. They have reoriented member country disaster programs away from post-event \nfunding and made risk financing a central pillar.

The World Bank is also developing \na Pacific region disaster reserve fund17 that will provide a reserve structure, fund management, \npreliminary funding of reserves, and support for reinsurance protection. Work on this fund has \napplied  lessons  learned  about  the  importance  of  consensus  building  and  stakeholder \nconsultation. ADB has supported this effort by providing risk exposure data for 15 Pacific region \nDMCs.18 \n \n10.  The IDB has taken a different course, stressing the creation of systematic, multifaceted \nrisk management programs at the national level that are tailored to each country. To link DRM \ninvestments  to  a  national  DRM  strategy,  the  IDB  model  has  integrated  a  variety  of  DRR \ninvestments (e.g., disaster awareness programs, assistance with building code compliance, and \nstrengthened national regulatory environments) with the DRF efforts.  \n \n11.  ADB has chosen to develop a disaster management strategy closely associated with this \nIDB model. Building on the three pillars of DRF, DRR, and CCA, ADB\u2019s IDRM approach will \nseek to develop systematic DRM programs at national and city levels in DMCs to significantly \nenhance their capacity to manage disaster risk. The IDRM framework will involve an element of \nconditionality that will provide incentives to DMCs to adopt a holistic approach to DRM to reduce \nthe impacts of disasters and enhance climate resilience. \n \n12.  Climate risk is a vital component of the IDRM framework due to the strong relationship \nbetween CCA and DRM. An increase in extreme meteorological events, resulting in disastrous \nconsequences, is an important manifestation of climate change. Drought, flooding, landslides, \nand coastal erosion are among the risks raised by climate change and these hazards must be \nincorporated in any comprehensive IDRM framework. This is particularly true for major urban \nareas in Indonesia and the Philippines that face serious threats from both climate change and \nother natural hazards.  \n \n13.  This TA will be complemented by additional activities under a climate change cluster TA \nthat will focus on risk profiling and testing of DRF solutions in a third project in urban areas in \nViet Nam that face primarily hydrometeorological risks. While that project will be managed as a \nseparate component within a broader climate change cluster TA and will explore risk factors and \nrisk financing obstacles that may be encountered in addressing climate change scenarios, it will \nalso feed into this TA for Indonesia and Philippines.  \n \n14.  Demand by DMCs for more DRM tools and programs is partially offset by their concern \nthat  spending  on  DRM  measures  before  a  disaster  could  jeopardize  assistance  for \nreconstruction and rehabilitation after one occurs. This concern shows that a DMC focus on \npost-disaster funding continues and highlights the difficulty of winning DMC acceptance of \nupfront investment in risk management even though this can reduce the economic impacts of a \nnatural disaster by $7 for every $1 spent (footnote 13). To help DMC governments realize the \npotential gains from better DRM, ADB will gradually incorporate IDRM programs that (i) increase \nDMC awareness of the benefits of IDRM policies, (ii) illustrate the impact of IDRM via DRF \nprojects, (iii) demonstrate the utility of risk models to support DRF, and (iv) develop DMC \ncapacity to build their own DRM institutions and programs. \n \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n                                                 \n17 World Bank. 2010.

THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n15.  The impact of the TA will be greater DRM capacity, reduced disaster impacts over time, \nand enhanced climate resilience. The outcome will be strengthened national and urban capacity \nin DRF in the context of IDRM in Indonesia and Philippines. \n  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n16.  The TA aims to establish an IDRM framework building on three areas simultaneously: \nDRF, DRR, and CCA. These key areas will be supported by the development of projects, each \nof which will advance the use of finance instruments, link the financing to investments in risk \nreduction, and promote climate change adaptation. The project activities will be organized \naround four outputs to achieve the outcome outlined above: (i) risk profiling and risk modeling, \n(ii)  product  design  and  implementation  of  DRF  projects,  (iii)  awareness  raising    through \nconsultation, training, and dissemination and (iv) establishment of a project management unit to \nimplement the TA.  \n \n17.  Risk profiling and risk modeling. The TA will fund the development of disaster risk \nprofiles based on available hazard, exposure, and loss data. Two project cities each will be \nselected in Indonesia and the Philippines based on the risk profiling and consultations with the \ngovernments  on  DRM  priorities.  The  risk  profiling  data  will  also  be  important  for  the \ndevelopment  of  disaster  risk  models  to  define  the  hazards,  locations,  and  the  severity  of \ndisaster events that will trigger financing under the DRF program. Quality models are essential \nto structure successful DRF projects and to build disaster databases to support further DMC \nand regional disaster research. \n \n18.  Product design and implementation of DRF projects. Based on this risk analysis, the \nTA will support the exploration of opportunities and the technical feasibility of developing DRF \nsolutions for major urban areas in Indonesia and the Philippines. The feasibility study will narrow \navailable DRF options to those that reflect DMC demand, are technically feasible, and can be \nsupported in commercial markets, if needed. Assistance will be provided to fully develop, design, \nand implement DRF projects in each project city. Stakeholder workshops will be held to solicit \ninput and cities will be identified based on demand, feasibility, availability of hazard data, and \ncommercial  market  acceptance,  if  needed.  Design  options  will  then  be  considered  and \nimplemented  in  response  to  DMC  requirements  and  technical  considerations.  Preliminary \nscoping activities have suggested options for potential DRF products: (i) insurance programs; (ii) \nsovereign  disaster  liquidity  insurance;  (iii)  standby  emergency  credit  programs;  (iv)  a \ncatastrophe bond program; or (v) an innovative combination of these approaches (e.g., using a \nshort-term  emergency  loan  that  would  be  repaid  under  indemnity  insurance  coverage). \nUltimately, ADB\u2019s aim is to build on the TA results to support national and local governments to \napply the IDRM framework throughout urban areas in Indonesia, the Philippines, and other \nDMCs. \n \n19.  Significant  opportunities  will  exist  for  governments  and  ADB  to  collaborate  with \ncommercial market participants during the design and implementation of the DRF projects and \nunder the IDRM framework afterwards. Building on lessons from this collaboration, the TA will \nalso support development of effective PPP models for DRF that leverage resources and skills to \ndeliver innovative financial solutions to DMCs that neither governments nor the commercial \nmarket  could  produce  entirely  on  their  own.  Examples  include  risk  modeling,  insurance \nstructuring and placement, reinsurance, and ongoing capital market support. \n \n20.  Awareness raising through consultation, training, and dissemination. Throughout \nthe inception and implementation of the TA, planning workshops and training courses will be \n ", "  5\nheld to engage a wide range of stakeholders coming from national and local government \nagencies, civil society organizations, academic institutions, and the private sector. The results of \nthe TA will also be disseminated widely to stakeholders in Indonesia and the Philippines as well \nas elsewhere in Asia and the Pacific through ADB reports, regional conferences, and other fora \nto keep the public informed and to mobilize support for improved disaster risk management \n \n18.  Establishment of a project management unit to implement the TA. To oversee the \ndesign and implementation of TA activities, project teams will be established that bring together \nkey staff from all related agencies within the national and local governments. Engagement of \ncivil society organizations and the private sector will also be encouraged through consultation \nand partnering activities. \n \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n22.  The regional policy and advisory TA is estimated to cost $2,000,000. The TA will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n23.  The proposed TA will be implemented over a period of 36 months. ADB, through the \nPublic  Management,  Governance,  and  Participation  Division  within  the  Regional  and \nSustainable Development Department, will be the executing agency. The Public Management, \nGovernance, and Participation Division will manage the TA in close coordination with ADB\u2019s \nSoutheast  Asia  Department  and  the  Regional  and  Sustainable  Development  Department\u2019s \nClimate Change Program Coordination Unit, the Environment and Safeguards Division, and the \nSustainable Infrastructure Division. The National Agency for Disaster Management in Indonesia \nand  the  National  Disaster  Risk  Reduction  and  Management  Council  of  the  Office  of  Civil \nDefense in the Philippines will act as the implementing agencies. Working in their respective \ncountries, they will lead engagement with relevant government agencies, follow the progress of \nthe TA, identify opportunities to expand IDRM activities within the context of ongoing urban \ndevelopment, promote lessons and insights from the project to other urban areas, provide \nassistance and inputs to support project requirements, and coordinate local logistics. \n \n24.  The  TA  will  utilize  115  person-months  of  consultancy  inputs  to  be  provided  by  7 \ninternational consultants (47 person-months) and 8 national consultants (68 person-months). All \nbut one of the consultants will be engaged through a firm, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Given the importance, \ncomplexity, and impact of the project, the quality- and cost-based selection method, based on a \nquality-to-cost ratio of 80:20, and simplified technical proposals will be used. ADB will directly \nengage an international consultant as project coordinator on an individual basis for 15 person-\nmonths in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Disbursements under \nthe TA will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook \n(2010, as amended from time to time). The outline terms of reference for consultants is in \nAppendix 3. Activities funded by this TA are subject to the formal review and approval of the \ngovernments and ADB. The TA is expected to be implemented from May 2011 to May 2014.  \n \nIV.

Acting under the \nprimary direction of RSDD and coordinated by a lead project coordinator consultant, a specialist \nconsultant firm(s) will design and execute an entry strategy for ADB into disaster risk finance \n(DRF), leading to the design and implementation of two DRF projects. The entry strategy will \nidentify  opportunities  for  the  application  of  DRF  solutions  in  developing  member  countries \n(DMCs) throughout the region and for potential synergies from ADB involvement. The strategy \nwill also link new financing techniques relating to natural disasters closely to climate change \nadaptation (CCA) initiatives that seek to reduce the risks of natural disasters from climate \nchange.  \n \nA.
