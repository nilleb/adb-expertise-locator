INTRODUCTION \n1.  Asia and the Pacific is highly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change. It \ncontains more people at risk than any other region of the world. This places the need to address \nclimate  change  firmly  on  the  region's  economic  development  agenda.  Continued  poverty \nreduction in Asia and the Pacific will not be possible without proactive efforts to mitigate the \ncauses of global warming and help the region to adapt to the impacts of climate change, \nespecially as they affect the most vulnerable; the poor, women, children and the elderly.  \n \n2.  The great diversity of conditions across Asia and the Pacific will require differentiated \nresponses based on the degree and type of each country\u2019s vulnerability, its energy sector, and \nthe carbon intensity of its economy. There will be an enormous need to finance mitigation and \nadaptation measures as well as knowledge products in a range of sectors and thematic areas.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  ADB identified environmentally sustainable growth and especially climate change as a \ncore area for ADB operations in its Strategy 2020.1 In April 2010, Management approved a \npaper that identified five strategic priorities for climate change in the region and described how \nADB will support its developing member countries (DMCs) in addressing these five priorities.2 \nThe paper provides a coherent direction for ADB's climate change program. The strategic \ndirections outlined in the paper now need to be implemented.  \n \n4.  The major issues identified in the paper are as follows. \n \n(i)  Virtually all of ADB's DMCs have prepared national climate change action plans \nand related documents, a clear sign of the importance they assign to climate \nchange in national economic development. However, a daunting array of policy, \ngovernance and capacity development challenges face these countries as they \nproceed to mainstream climate change programs. These challenges cut across \nall aspects of climate change action, and must be addressed as overarching \ncomponents of support to DMCs. \n(ii)  If current patterns continue, Asia is projected to account for about 45% of global \nenergy-related emissions by 2030. A massive shift toward clean energy will be \nneeded, and ADB should be ready to scale up its already substantial support in \nthis area. The main challenge to scaling up clean energy in the region is linking \nthe  strong  pipeline  of  clean  energy  projects  and  programs  with  sources  of \nadequate funding. Recent reports by the Secretary General of the United Nations \nindicate  that,  for  energy  efficiency  alone,  annual  investments  of  $30 billion\u2013\n$35 billion are needed for low-income countries and $140 billion\u2013$170 billion for \nmiddle-income countries.3  \n(iii)  Asia's cities are the world\u2019s single largest contributor of new greenhouse gas \nemissions, with associated adverse health, traffic congestion, water supply and \nother problems. Transport is the fastest growing source of these emissions. More \nsustainable  transport  and  urban  development  are  needed  to  avoid  further \n                                                \n1 ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n2  ADB. 2010. Addressing Climate Change in Asia and the Pacific: Priorities for Action.

The Secretary General's Advisory Group on Energy and Climate Change. \nhttp://www.un.org/wcm/webdav/site/climatechange/shared/Documents/AGECC%20summary%20report%5B1%5D.\npdf (accessed 30 April 2010). \n ", "2     \n \nmassive environmental and economic costs and to bring about clean air, safer \nroads and generally more livable cities. \n(iv)  A recent ADB report4 indicated that up to 75% of Southeast Asia's greenhouse \ngas emissions are caused by land use change, especially deforestation. This is \ntrue of other countries in the region, particularly several Pacific DMCs. ADB \nacknowledges  the  need  to  take  focused  remedial  action  together  with \ndevelopment partners. \n(v)  Asia and the Pacific is home to the largest population at risk from climate change, \nso a vast expansion of adaptation measures is urgently needed. As the effects \non water supply, staple crops, health, livelihoods and quality of life generally \nbecome more intense and widespread, it will be the poor, women and other \nvulnerable  segments  of  society  that  are  hit  the  hardest.  Promoting  climate \nresilience is an integral part of development for all countries in the region.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n5.  This will be an interdepartmental cluster technical assistance (TA) with subprojects at \ninterregional,  regional,  national  and  subnational  levels  to  be  implemented  by  various \ndepartments in ADB. It will help DMCs to build climate change and disaster risk reduction in \nvulnerable sectors and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions of highly polluting sectors through \ncapacity building, knowledge sharing and the generation of project concepts for adaptation and \nmitigation interventions. It will facilitate investment by the private sector and involvement by civil \nsociety.  \n \n6.  The cluster approach is proposed because it will (i) ensure that ADB's climate change \nactivities are cohesive and coordinated and in line with Addressing Climate Change in Asia and \nthe Pacific: Priorities for Action, and (ii) serve as a vehicle to attract broad as well as issue-\nspecific co-financing from bilateral, multilateral and private funding sources. All of the TA's \nproposed and future sub-projects will respond to the five priority areas identified in Addressing \nClimate Change in Asia and the Pacific: Priorities for Action. Below, each of the currently \nproposed subprojects are listed alongside the corresponding strategic priority. The outcomes of \nindividual subprojects are explained in brief here, and the outputs are outlined in paragraph 10. \n \n(i)  Strengthening  policies,  governance  and  capacities.  Two  cross-cutting \nsubprojects are being designed: (i) Capacity Development to Address Climate \nChange by the Climate Change Program Coordination Unit in the Regional and \nSustainable Development Department (RSDD-CC), to strengthen participating \nDMCs' and development practitioners' capacity to apply best available climate \nchange knowledge to development planning (para. 10), and (ii) Developing and \nApplying Low-Carbon Development Policy Analysis Tools by the Economics and \nResearch Department (ERD) to enhance the low-carbon planning capacity of \nnational agencies and institutions through models and road maps for low-carbon \ngrowth. A third subproject, which will provide support for civil society involvement \nin climate change action, will be designed later for implementation in this priority \narea. \n(ii)  Expanding the use of clean energy. A subproject is being prepared by RSDD-\nCC for approval in the third quarter of 2010 to develop mechanisms that can \nleverage large-scale private sector investment in clean energy in DMCs.  \n                                                \n4 ADB. 2009. Economics of Climate Change in Southeast Asia: A Regional Review. Manila. \n ", "    3 \n(iii)  Encouraging sustainable transport and urban development. Subprojects will \nbe led by the Sustainable Infrastructure Division in RSDD (RSID). They will begin \nin 2011 or 2012 when the results of ongoing work and the requirements for \nfollow-on support become known. \n(iv)  Managing land use and forests for carbon sequestration. Subprojects will \nbuild  on  existing  projects,  supporting  payment  for  ecosystem  services  and \nbuilding capacity to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. \nIt is expected that a subproject will be proposed in 2011 by RSDD-CC. \n(v)  Promoting  climate-resilient  development.  Three  subprojects  are  currently \nbeing prepared: (i) Build Resilience to Disaster and Climate Change Impacts by \nthe Environment and Safeguards Division in RSDD (para. 10), (ii) Supporting \nInvestments in Water and Climate Change, and (iii) a subproject to create an \nintegrated disaster risk management model incorporating disaster risk financing, \ndisaster  risk  management,  and  climate  change  adaptation  by  the  Public \nManagement, Governance and Participation Division of RSDD (RSGP) for the \nthird quarter of 2010.  \n \n7.  The cluster TA will be coordinated with other TA projects and investment projects related \nto  climate  change,5 including  those  financed  by  the  Climate  Investment  Funds,  Global \nEnvironment Facility and other international climate programs. \n \nA.   Impact and Outcome  \n \n8.   The TA impact will be that participating governments will increase appropriate responses \nto climate change and disasters with support from civil society and the private sector. The \noutcome will be that participating governments are able to integrate climate change and disaster \nresponses with social and economic development goals. The overall design and monitoring \nframework for the TA is in Appendix 1.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n9.   The  cluster  TA  will  build  on  a  range  of  ADB  experience,  particularly  that  of  the \noperations departments, in supporting capacity development for climate change responses at \nregional, national and subnational levels in ADB\u2019s five strategic priority areas. ADB will support \nscientific,  economic  and  social  impact  assessments  of  climate  and  disaster  risk  to  guide \npolicymakers and regulators in responding to climate change. Through this TA, ADB will provide \ngovernments with better scientific and economic data at national and subnational levels to assist \ndecision-making. The TA will provide support for community, social and physical-science-based \nimpact  maps,  geographic  information  system  (GIS)  data,  climate  modeling  and  economic \nanalysis on comparative costs of climate responses. Participating governments will be able to \nidentify strategies for climate change and disaster risk reduction response and build related \ninstitutional capacity. A methodology will be developed to ensure government and civil society \norganization approaches are combined. This will enable participating countries to make more \nuse of civil society to implement community-based mitigation and adaptation initiatives and to \nassess social impacts of climate change. The TA will stimulate greater private sector financing \nfor climate change mitigation and adaptation activities. \n                                                \n5 For example, ADB. 2009.

Described below are the three subprojects submitted at this time for approval under the \nTA cluster. 6 Subsequent subprojects of the TA will be determined by ADB, adopting a demand-\ndriven approach within the five priority areas. \n. \n(i)   Capacity  Development  to  Address  Climate  Change.  This  subproject  will \nstrengthen participating DMCs' and development practitioners' capacity to apply \nthe best available climate change knowledge to development planning. It will \nhave four components: (i) achieving development and climate change results, \nwhich will develop a set of indicators to provide a consistent assessment of \nclimate-related investments and a plan for their application; (ii) climate change \ncapacity  development  for  policymakers,  regulators  and  development \nprofessionals  covering  both  government  and  civil  society  approaches;  (iii)  a \nclimate atlas, which will summarize data from ongoing analyses by ADB and \npartners using an online platform; and (iv) applying development communications \nto improve climate responses, which will support climate change operational \ncommunications and knowledge management.  \n(ii)   Build Resilience to Disaster and Climate Change Impacts. This subproject \nwill  (i)  integrate  climate  resilience  considerations  into  national  and  sector \nplanning  processes;  (ii)  address  policy,  research  and  knowledge  gaps  to \nenhance climate resilience at sector and project levels; (iii) help DMCs build \nclimate resilience through  investment planning  which reduces climate risk to \nprojects;  and  (iv)  strengthen  DMC  and  ADB  capacity  to  build  and  promote \nclimate resilience. It will provide resources for pilot interventions that will help \nintegrate climate resilience into country partnership strategies, sector road maps \nand projects at risk from climate change. These pilot interventions will include \npreparation of climate impact studies and vulnerability assessments, economic \nanalyses of climate impacts and responses, development of tools and methods \nfor climate proofing vulnerable infrastructure and investments and provision of \ntechnical assistance to DMC agencies.  \n(iii)   Supporting Investments in Water and Climate Change. This subproject will \nimprove  climate  change  projections  for  water  management,  and  impact \nassessments and adaptation strategies for selected river basins and projects in \nthese basins, with guidelines and advice to policy and decision makers. It will \ninclude close engagement with project and river basin managers, scientists and \nknowledge  managers.  Knowledge  will  be  disseminated  to  leaders  through  a \nsteering group of select policymakers, regulators and civil society representatives.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The estimated total cost of the initial three subprojects is $3.25 million, of which $2.25 \nmillion  will  be  financed  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-Others)  for \nsubprojects one and two and $1 million will be financed by the Multi-Donor Trust Fund under the \nWater  Financing  Partnership  Facility  for  subproject  three,  administered  by  the  ADB.  The \ncontributors to the Multi-Donor Trust Fund are the governments of Australia, Austria, Norway, \nand Spain. The estimated overall TA cost over 4 years is $10 million for the activities outlined \n                                                \n6 Subproject outputs are defined here according to ADB Operations Manual paragraph 25 for Technical Assistance \nCluster. Detailed outputs and key activities, budget, implementation arrangements and schedule for existing \nsubprojects are provided in the Appendix and will be completed within the overall time frame and amount of the TA \ncluster; paragraph 25 suggests that all outputs and key activities be included in the TA report, however, these will \nbe identified and detailed during the course of the cluster consistent with the specified priority areas. \n ", "    5 \nabove, which supplement ongoing and planned responses in ADB DMCs. Additional funds may \nbe mobilized from TASF or from bilateral, multilateral or private sources and may be used either \nto  top-up  the  first  three  subprojects  or  to  start  new  subprojects.  The  cost  estimates  and \nfinancing plans for the first three subprojects are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.   Implementation Arrangements \n12.  ADB  will  coordinate  the  TA  cluster  through  RSDD.  The  executing  agency  and \nimplementing agency for each subproject will be determined at the time of subproject approval \nunder the TA cluster. For  any  interregional  subproject, ADB will be the  executing  agency \nthrough RSDD or ERD. For subprojects in a particular region, ADB will be the executing agency, \nthrough the regional department or RSDD. For national subprojects, ADB through the regional \ndepartment, the Private Sector Operations Department, or the DMC government will be the \nexecuting  agency.  Additional  subprojects  may  be  submitted  by  any  operational  or  central \ndepartment  wishing  to  implement  related  work.  No-objection  letters  will  be  obtained  from \nparticipating country governments in accordance with ADB guidelines. The TA is expected to be \nimplemented from September 2010 to August 2014.  \n \n13.  The cluster TA will be administered through existing ADB institutional arrangements for the \nclimate  change  program.  These  structures  primarily  comprise:  the  RSDD  Climate  Change \nProgram Coordination Unit (RSDD-CC); the Adaptation and Land-Use Working Group, which \nwill  coordinate  all  adaptation  and  resilience  subprojects  as  well  as  land-use  and  forest \nmanagement subprojects; and the Clean Energy Working Group, which will coordinate all clean \nenergy subprojects. Both working groups include representatives from operational departments \nand ERD. Both are also under the Climate Change Steering Committee, which is comprised of \nthe directors  general  of  the  operational departments  and ERD,  and is chaired  by director \ngeneral, RSDD. Strategic oversight for the TA cluster will be provided by the Climate Change \nSteering  Committee,  with  the  supervision  of  Vice  President,  Knowledge  Management  and \nSustainable Development.  \n \n14.  The consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time). A biodata-based selection method will be \nadopted. Outline terms of reference for the consulting services for the first three subprojects are \nin Appendix 3. Given that this is a TA cluster, other methods of consultant selection may be \nproposed.  In  such  cases,  a  memo  for  a  change  in  implementation  arrangements  will  be \naccomplished. Equipment will be procured by the consultants following ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2010, as amended from time to time) and turned over to relevant governments \nfollowing completion of the TA. Disbursements under the TA will be done in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). A \ntotal of about 81 and 142 person-months are required for international and national consultants, \nrespectively. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION AND DECISION  \n15.   The President recommends that the Board approve the provision of technical assistance \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $2,250,000 on a grant basis for Enabling Climate Change \nResponses  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific.  If  the  Board  approves  ADB  providing  the  technical \nassistance, the President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, will approve ADB \nadministering  the  balance  of  the  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of \n$1,000,000 to be financed on grant basis by the Multi-Donor Trust Fund under the Water \nFinancing Partnership Facility for Enabling Climate Change Responses in Asia and the Pacific. \n ", "6   Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions and \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \nParticipating  Within 5 years of TA  DMC and ADB investment  Climate change will \ngovernments increase  approval, at least 50% of  portfolios  continue to occur and \nappropriate responses  participating  its effects can be \nto climate change and  governments will have  measured and \ndisasters with support  adopted policy  presented \nfrom civil society and  frameworks, investment   \nthe private sector  programs, projects  Risks \nand/or other actions that  Governments do not \nincrease appropriate  officially endorse the \nresponses to climate  plans, policies, and/or \nchange and disasters  other actions proposed \nwith support from civil  through the TA. \nsociety and the private  Changes in \nsector  governments or \ngovernment policies \nderail adaptation or \nmitigation efforts in \nparticipating DMCs \nOutcome       Assumption \nParticipating  At least 50% of  Government investment  A general consensus \ngovernments are able  participating  portfolios, national  is reached by selected \nto integrate climate  governments will have  communications to  DMCs and relevant \nchange and disaster  adopted policy  UNFCCC, low-carbon  institutions on the best \nresponses with social  frameworks and  growth, adaptation and/or  approaches to respond \nand economic  developed investment  disaster risk management  to climate and \ndevelopment goals  programs that integrate    development needs \n   climate change and   \ndisaster responses with  Risks \nsocial and economic  The results of the TA \ndevelopment goals   do not attract \n  investment or policy \n  support \n   \n  The policies and \n  investments identified \ndo not adequately \naddress climate \nchange and economic \nand social \ndevelopment needs  \nOutput      Assumptions \n1.
