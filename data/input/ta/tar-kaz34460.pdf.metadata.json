Human development is one of the priorities for ADB\u2019s support to Kazakshtan. A technical \nassistance (TA) Fact-Finding Mission visited Kazakhstan during 25 September\u201315 October \n2001 and met with key officials of central and province (oblast) governments, international \norganizations, and other stakeholders (teachers, principals, academicians) to discuss continued \nADB  assistance  to  the  education  sector  including  preparation  of  a  comprehensive  sector \nupdate. ADB and the Government agreed during the country programming mission in May 2002 \nto implement an advisory TA to take a fresh look at the overall needs of the education sector. \nThe  objectives,  scope,  and  institutional  arrangements  for  the  TA1  are  based  on  the \nunderstanding reached with the Government. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Kazakhstan achieved a high level of social development under the former Soviet Union \nand at independence in 1991 inherited universal access to basic education, almost universal \nliteracy, and high female participation in all levels of education. Such achievements, made \npossible with high commitment and sustained high investment in education for several decades, \ncompared  favorably  with  middle  or  higher  income  countries  globally.  However,  the  severe \neconomic downturn following independence squeezed public financing for education, which \ndropped from over 6 percent of gross domestic product in 1991 to about 3 percent in 1994 \nbefore rising to around 4 percent in 1999. Until 1997, available resources for operations were \nlargely limited to personnel salaries, with many schools having to manage without adequate \nbooks, supplies, and maintenance. Many teachers moved to other jobs. Many urban schools are \ncrowded and have had to cope with high enrollment by operating in shifts. The number of \npreschool and technical and vocational education and training (TVET) institutions has been \nreduced significantly, partly due to deliberate rationalization efforts, but also due to budget \nconstraints. There is a wide concern that resource constraints have eroded the hard-earned \nquality of education. Additional challenges are associated with Kazakhstan\u2019s move to a market \neconomy, as it struggles to retain its past achievements.  \n \n3.  As a priority of the country operational strategy prepared in 1996, ADB supported the \neducation sector with two projects,2 which mitigated the adverse impact of financial constraints \nduring the crisis and laid the foundation for reform in the education sector. Two advisory TAs3 \nhave supported policy dialogue and wider policy reform. Lessons learned from a recent TA \nperformance report4 concluded that (i) for the success and sustainability of TA outcomes, it is \ncrucial to establish linkages with other ministries, particularly ministries of finance; (ii) effective \npolicy dialogue with Governments and stakeholders on the formulation of education policies that \nrespond to the changing needs and aspirations of the people should continue to be supported; \nand (iii) there is a need to enhance analytical skills of ministries of education related to the \neducation management information system.  \n                                                           \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 12 November 2001 as project preparatory TA for the \nThird Education Project.  \n2  ADB. 1996.

The Technical Assistance Performance Audit Report reviewed six advisory TAs in the education sector \nin Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic and Uzbekistan. Two TAs were rated highly satisfactory, three satisfactory \n(including two in Kazakhstan), and one partially satisfactory. \n ", "2   \n \n4.  ADB has been the major external funding agency in the education sector in Kazakhstan. \nExternal assistance is also provided by the European Union; Germany; Japan; United Nations \nChildren\u2019s Fund; United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization; and United \nStates Agency for International Development; among others. A formal mechanism/framework to \nfacilitate coordination has not yet been established.  \n \n5.  The education system is the responsibility of the Ministry of Education and Science \n(MOES) and is administered through a network of departments of education in the country\u2019s 14 \noblasts and two major cities (Almaty and Astana), and education officers at the district (raion) \nlevel.  Basic  education  (or  general  secondary  education)  is  11  years  (grades  1\u201311)  and \ncompulsory, consisting of 4 years of primary, 5 years of lower secondary, and 2 years of upper \nsecondary education. TVET is available at the upper secondary and tertiary levels. Tertiary \nsecondary education is provided by public and private institutions.  \n \n6.  Financing. Allocation of financial resources by level of education has improved in favor \nof  basic  education,  with  attempts  to  diversify  resources  for  TVET  and  tertiary  education. \nHowever,  wide  variations  exist  in  per  student  allocation  to  education  across  oblasts  with \npotential for disparity in service delivery. Low salaries of teachers (although increased recently), \nlimited  allocations  to  teacher  training,  more  dropouts,  inadequate  supplies  of  essential \ninstructional materials and equipment, deteriorating physical infrastructure due to lack of regular \nrepair and maintenance, and inadequate funding to schools in general and rural schools in \nparticular point to the need to increase resources. A major direction for reform is to improve the \nquality of education through more equitable distribution of educational inputs targeted to rural \nareas,5  more  balanced  resource  allocation  to  education  institutions,  and  greater  focus  on \ndevelopment and capital needs. The Government is considering moving to a 12-year basic \neducation system from the current 11-year system, but the financial implications of such a \ntransition have not been fully assessed.  \n \n7.  Management.  Limited  flexibility  at  schools  in  the  use  of  available  resources,  and \ninadequate authority and mechanisms to apply locally suitable decisions on instruction, and \npedagogical and school management indicate a continued centralized approach. The basis of \ndecentralization has been established, but the roles of agencies at different levels need to be \nclarified and capacities strengthened significantly. The role of MOES to coordinate and lead the \nsystem  is  particularly  critical.  A  comprehensive  and  effective  education  management \ninformation system, although evolving, requires substantial support to generate reliable and \ninternationally comparable statistics, and to support participation of a range of stakeholders in \ndecentralized management, decision making, and monitoring. Management of schools and key \ninstitutions (raion, oblast, training institutions) needs to be improved. \n \n8.  Quality. Although the stated objective of the Government and MOES is to make the \ncurriculum more process focused\u2014to make it more modern and learner centered with a focus \non differentiated learning and functional literacy\u2014the actual implementation has been slow. A \nfocus on improving critical and creative thinking, and analytical and problem solving skills of \nstudents is also needed. This means greater emphasis should be placed on staff retraining and \nmaintaining  close  coordination  between  curriculum  revision,  teacher  training,  classroom \npractices, and student assessment. Inadequate quality of rural schools is a major concern, since \nnumerous rural schools lack science and language laboratories and subject teachers. Education \nassessment must be improved and applied to ensure higher outcomes for all students. \n                                                           \n5  ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance to Kazakhstan for Comprehensive Medium-Term Poverty Reduction Strategy. \nManila. ", "    3\n \n9.  The  challenge  for  Kazakhstan  is  to  maintain  the  strengths  of  its  education  system \n(generally high standards, high literacy rates, generally qualified and motivated teachers, and \nhistorically  high  commitment  to  education),  while  significantly  improving  funding  (increased \nallocation, improved funding mechanisms), quality (child-centered learning, curriculum renewal, \nprovision of new generation textbooks, retraining of teachers), and management (strengthening \nrural  schools,  improving  the  educational  management  information  system,  more  effective \nmonitoring and evaluation).  \n \n10.  The Government has taken a number of important steps since independence to reform \nthe education sector. The first stage of reform was initiated in 1992 with the adoption of the Law \non Education, which was revised in 1999 to provide a framework to guide the education system. \nUnder the new Law, for example, the Government intends to provide one-year compulsory \npreschool  education.  The  second  stage  of  reform  started  in  1995  involved  broad-scale \nrestructuring of basic (general secondary) education. The third stage of reform was initiated in \n1999 with the preparation of a broad strategy of development to 2030. In 2000 the Government \napproved the State Program for Education for the medium term and in 2001 developed the \neducation strategy for 2001-2010. Since independence, the Government has issued several \ndecrees and resolutions to address different constraints, challenges, and reforms. In the last two \nyears, the trend has been to strengthen basic education through legislative reforms and by \nproviding more resources.  \n \n11.  Decentralization is an important policy; MOES has been reorganized several times and \nits staff reduced since independence. Oblasts and raions now finance almost 100 percent of the \nbudget for preschool and basic education. MOES maintains authority over policy, strategy, \nnorms  and  standard  regulations,  and  mobilization  of  state  resources  for  stabilization  and \ndevelopment. The Government has tried to reinforce its national educational model to provide \nbroad access to high quality education with the establishment of unified national testing and \nprovision of credits and grants to tertiary students on a competitive basis, and resolution on \nsocial assistance to vulnerable groups. Computerization, diversification of funding, participation \nof the private sector, drafting of norms and standards, a shift of focus to rural schools, and \ndiversification of TVET are other initiatives. These experiences gained must now be used to \ndeepen the reform process with much greater focus on effective implementation through wider \nparticipation. \n \n12.  The Government\u2019s major priorities, reflected in policies and implementation, include (i) \nproviding one year of compulsory preschool education to prepare students better for formal \nschooling, in particular disadvantaged students; (ii) extending school education from the 11-year \nto a 12-year system; (iii) developing information and communication technology (ICT) to support \nthe education system; (iv) modernizing education management; and (v) rationalizing the TVET \nsystem to cater to the needs of small and medium businesses through partnerships with the \nprivate sector. The Government has already made considerable efforts to increase the role of \nthe  private  sector  in  tertiary  education  with  a  significant  increase  in  the  level  of  private \nparticipation  and  cost.  Opportunities  exist  to  improve  governance  of  tertiary  education \ninstitutions, financing, the accreditation system and its application, and involvement of tertiary \ninstitutions to support priority programs (staff development, information, ICT, research, etc.).  \n \n13.  The Government\u2019s State Program for Education recognizes the need to develop flexible \nstrategies and action plans in order to adapt to changing circumstances. The priorities include \nnew  general  secondary  education  curricula,  improvements  in  textbooks  and  methodology, \nsupport to rural schools, implementation of the Law on Education, modernization of education \n ", "4   \nmanagement, introduction of a new financing system, and upgrading of education statistics and \nmonitoring systems. The Government expects its state program to provide a policy foundation \nfor implementing education sector programs. This will require wider dissemination of rules and \nregulations, serious effort to seek feedback from practitioners to support implementation, and \nmuch greater coordination among national and international agencies involved in education. \n \n14.  In summary, the Government was drawn into addressing short-term problems caused by \nfinancial shocks and transitional challenges during the initial years since independence. Building \non the stabilization measures, the Government has introduced longer-term goals, objectives, \nand  strategies.  Several  elements  of  reform  have  been  introduced  with  positive  results\u2014\ndiversification  of  financing,  private  sector  involvement,  social  assistance  strategy,  and \nstrengthening of basic (general secondary) education. Areas requiring substantial improvement \ninclude quality of rural schools, sustainable application of ICT in education, clarification of \ndecentralization, overall coordination, and evaluation of different interventions. Lessons learned \nover the past 10 years can help determine what has worked, and identify and prioritize what still \nneeds to be done. The combined effect of improvements in the economy, the Government\u2019s \npriorities articulated in its State Program for Education and Development Strategy 2001\u20132010, \nand  lessons  learned  from  developments  in  the  education  sector,  including  ADB-supported \nprojects  and  sector  work,  offer  new  opportunities  to  move  to  the  next  level  of  education \ndevelopment and cooperation.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n15.  The main objective of the TA is to update the comprehensive education and training \nsector review completed in 1995/1996 (footnote 3) to identify key sector issues and priorities \nand to contribute to strengthening the Government\u2019s education sector development strategy. \nThe update will incorporate developments and lessons from recent interventions, firm up the \nreform framework of the Government up to 2010 for sustainable development of the education \nsector, and build on the sector work and projects supported by ADB and reform initiatives of the \nGovernment. \n  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n16.  The TA will update the 1995\u20131996 sector review covering preschool, basic education \n(general secondary), tertiary education, and TVET. Since the sector analyses and reviews \nunder the two ADB TAs were comprehensive, a major objective of the update is to capture the \ncurrent status and political economy of education reform in Kazakhstan. The TA will assist the \nGovernment in diagnosing the weaknesses in the education system and preparing a strategy \nthat includes a sector reform program, an organization plan and a financing plan. The TA will \nalso assist the Government in developing a policy framework and a prioritized sector strategy to \nhelp articulate its priorities and strategies for the education sector for the medium and long term, \nbuilding on earlier recommendations and actual reform already under way. The sector update \nwill  combine  (i)  management  systems  analysis  and  rationalization  within  the  framework  of \ndecentralization, (ii) economic and financial analyses, (iii) needs assessment to target the most \nneedy  population  and  regions,  (iv)  identification  of  pedagogical  renewal  priorities,  and  (v) \napplication of relevant lessons from within and outside Kazakhstan. The TA outputs will include \n(i) an agreed process for policy reform; and (ii) an agreed financial planning, management, and \nmonitoring system for the reform, in the context of decentralization, including the role of the \nMinistry of Finance and MOES in setting resource envelopes informed by the public expenditure ", "    5\nreview.  The TA will also provide a framework for aid coordination based on an analysis of \neffectiveness of external assistance in enabling policy-led reform, and an analysis of future \noptions  for  external  assistance.  It  will  also  identify  the  comprehensive  external  support \nrequirements, including the relative comparative advantages, of the Government to meet its \nmedium-term objectives in developing the education sector.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n17.  The cost of the TA is estimated at $857,200 equivalent, of which $403,000 is the foreign \nexchange cost and $454,200 equivalent is the local currency cost. ADB will finance $600,000 \nequivalent, which includes the entire foreign exchange cost and $197,000 equivalent of the local \ncurrency cost. The remaining local currency cost of $257,200 equivalent will be financed by the \nGovernment in kind. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, \nfunded by the Government of Japan. The detailed cost estimates and proposed financing \narrangements for the TA are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements  \n \n18.  The  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA  will  be  MOES.  MOES  will  establish  a  steering \ncommittee, chaired by the first vice minister of education, to provide policy guidance to the \nconsultants. The director of general secondary, primary, and vocational education will be the \nsecretary.  The  members  will  include  representatives  from  Ministry  of  Finance,  Ministry  of \nEconomy and Budget Planning, Division of Social and Cultural Development of the Prime \nMinister\u2019s Office, and two representatives each of oblast department of education (from among \nthose selected for school mapping/surveys) and the technical working group. The steering \ncommittee will meet three times (at the beginning, middle, and end of TA). The technical \nworking group, to be formed by the steering committee, will be chaired by the director of general \nsecondary, primary and vocational education, and include representatives/specialists from the \nkey  departments  of  MOES,  the  director  of  the  Republican  Institute  for  Improvement  of \nQualification of Employees of Education, the director of the Kazakh Academy for Education, and \ntwo prominent educators nominated by the steering committee. The technical working group will \nalso set up a number of groups as appropriate to work on specific issues such as personnel, \npay, decentralization, etc. The technical working group will provide technical inputs and help to \norganize workshops in partnership with interested agencies and consultation meetings with \nprominent experts, professionals, implementers, and beneficiaries as appropriate. \n \n19.  The TA is planned to be completed over 12 months (January 2003\u2013January 2004). ADB \nwill  select  and  engage  an  international  firm  following  the  quality-and-cost-based  selection \nmethod in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. A simplified technical \nproposal format will be used. The firm will provide 12 person-months of international, and 40 \nperson-months of domestic consulting services with expertise in financing, economic analysis, \nmanagement, pedagogy, and sector review. Office equipment will be procured through direct \npurchase procedures acceptable to ADB. Outline terms of reference including tasks, expertise, \nand reporting and consultation requirements are included in Appendix 3. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Kazakhstan for the Education Sector Development Strategy, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n ", "       \n  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK   \nDesign Summary  Performance Targets  Monitoring Mechanisms  Assumptions \nGoal       \nConfirm strategies and develop  \u2022  Mechanisms to increase education  \u2022  National statistics  The Government continues to  \nmechanisms to modernize the  participation and attainment  \u2022  Education survey  regard education reform as a \neducation system to meet the  \u2022  Mechanisms to improve external  \u2022  Labor market survey  priority for socioeconomic  \nneeds of an emerging market  efficiency of education with more  development \neconomy and international  educated and competitive labor force \neducation standards   \nPurpose       \n1.

Introduction \n1.  Under  the  guidance  of  the  steering  committee  and  in  close  collaboration  with  the \ntechnical working group, the technical assistance (TA) will be implemented by an international \nconsulting  firm.  The  consultant  team  will  work  closely  with  the  Government  officials  and \ncounterpart staff concerned with policy planning and program implementation in the education \nand training sector to ensure to the extent possible the transfer of skills in the areas of sector \nreview, issue analysis, sector planning, education management, and financial and economic \nanalysis.  Significant  analyses  and  recommendations  are  available  from  different  initiatives \n(Government reform documents, projects and TAs supported by the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB), World Bank\u2019s Public Expenditure Review, innovations and reforms supported by different \nagencies, etc.) over the past few years. The consultant team will liaise with different agencies \nworking in the field of education and training, and build on and add value to existing knowledge \nand analysis, and avoid duplication. To the extent possible, the consultant team will draw from \ninternational good practices and standards relevant to Kazakhstan. \n \n2.  ADB will select and engage an international firm following the quality-and-cost-based \nselection (QCBS) method in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. A \nsimplified technical proposal format will be used. The consulting firm will provide 12 person-\nmonths of international and 40 person-months of domestic consulting services. The TA will be \nimplemented over 12 months under the overall leadership and coordination of the education \nplanner,  economist,  and  team  leader,  who  will  also  be  responsible  for  TA  organization, \nmanagement, reporting, and completion. The TA will devote the first 6 months to undertaking \nthe sector review and the second 6 months to disseminating sector findings. The TA will adopt a \nflexible  approach  to  ensure  participation  of  key  stakeholders,  and  to  make  necessary \nadjustments depending on the availability of information and the need for different analyses. \nThe consultants will be guided by ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects, \nFinancial Analysis of Projects, and Handbook for Poverty and Social Analysis. \n \nB.  Tasks \n \n3.  The sector analyses and reviews conducted under the ADB-financed advisory TAs1 are \nconsidered comprehensive and will be the basis for the sector update through the proposed TA. \nIssues  in  the  education  system  relating  to  education  finance,  planning  and  management, \naccess, and employment were highlighted in the sector analyses. Under the sector update, the \nconsultant in consultation with key stakeholders and beneficiaries and after seeking feedback in \na national workshop will \n \n(i)  review  the  education  and  training  sector2  with  focus  on  reform  priorities, \nachievements and failures, innovations, opportunities and constraints, and reform \nprocess and transition (change) management; \n(ii)  review and incorporate important work already done, and develop an integrated \nand concise sector update report focusing on policy options;  \n                                                           \n1  ADB. 1994.
