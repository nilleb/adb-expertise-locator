Independent evaluation at the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has evolved over time. In \nresponse to a broader mandate for systematic and impartial assessments on the development \neffectiveness  of  ADB  operations,  the  Operations  Evaluation  Department  (OED)  has  made \nefforts to ensure that its evaluation program is strategic and integrated.1 It has (i) focused its 3-\nyear  rolling  work  program  on  priority  areas,  and  (ii)  moved  to  capture  synergies  with  the \noperations  departments  of  ADB.  OED\u2019s  3-year  work  programs  are  developed  based  on \ndiscussions with the Development Effectiveness Committee (DEC) of ADB\u2019s Board of Directors, \nADB Management, and operations and central departments, and take into account the issues of \nrelevance to developing member countries (DMCs) and the current institutional priorities. The \nDEC, which provides overall guidance to OED, endorsed OED\u2019s work program for 2008\u20132010 \non 18 October 2007. The work program was approved by the Board of Directors on 7 December \n2007.2 \n \n2.  For  2008\u20132010,  OED  will  continue  to  ensure  that  topics  in  its  work  program  are \nstrategically  relevant  to  ADB  and  its  DMCs  and  sequenced  properly  so  that  feedback  is \nprovided in a timely manner. It will undertake more broad evaluations of groups of sector or \ncountry operations and institutional development issues, themes, approaches, and policies. \nOED  will  also  seek  to  consolidate  its  evaluation  methods  including  (i)  strengthening  the \nvalidation process of all project/program completion reports and country partnership strategy \n(CPS) completion reports, (ii) enhancing the evaluative content of its annual reports, and (iii) \npreparing or strengthening its evaluation guidelines. Lastly, it will carry on promoting knowledge \ndevelopment  and  management  through  the  dissemination  of  evaluation  findings  and \nrecommendations in accessible and digestible ways. \n \n3.  OED\u2019s work program is presented in Appendix 1. The 2008 work program comprises 49 \nmajor evaluation reports and studies (including 11 studies carried over from previous year\u2019s \nprogram). Of these, forty are deliverables in 2008: 3 annual evaluation reports, 1 regional \ncooperation program evaluation, 2 country assistance program evaluations, 1 CPS completion \nreport validation, 4 sector assistance program evaluations (SAPEs), 9 special evaluation studies \n(SESs),  3  evaluation  updates/briefs,  and  project/program/technical  assistance  performance \nevaluations in the public sector (11) and the private sector (6). \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  Evaluation in ADB has evolved in response to the institution\u2019s changing focus. Over the \nyears, this has evolved to cover the entire results chain of inputs, outputs, outcomes, impacts \nand their sustainability. The focus of evaluation studies has shifted from the project to the \ncountry or regional level while drawing from purposeful sector and thematic assessments and \nevaluations of ADB\u2019s business processes. The full mix of lending and non-lending services that \nmake up country assistance programs has become the dominant preoccupation of broader \nevaluations (i.e., corporate evaluations, country and sector assistance evaluations, thematic \n                                                 \n1  OED\u2019s functions are to (i) assess the performance of completed projects and programs; (ii) review and validate self-\nevaluation activities of operations departments; (iii) provide feedback for the design and review of strategies, \npolicies, and operations; (iv) monitor and report on responses of ADB departments and executing agencies to \nevaluation findings and recommendations; (v) build evaluation capacity in DMCs; and (vi) harmonize evaluation \npractices and share evaluation experience with other multilateral development banks through the Evaluation \nCooperation Group. See also ADB Operations Manual K1: Operations Evaluation (Date of Issue: 26 March 2008). \n2  OED\u2019s work program is available at http://www.adb.org/oed/workprograms.asp.  \n ", "                   \n2     \nevaluations, and rigorous impact evaluations), with priority attention to relevance, efficiency, \neffectiveness, and sustainability.3 \n \n5.  The OED work program is being structured to emphasize organizational learning in a \nmore clearly defined results architecture and framework. Evaluations will be user-centric and \nsituationally  responsive.  OED  will  also  seek  a  deeper  understanding  of  the  users  of \nrecommendations and audiences since evaluations address a variety of information needs, \nwhether  operational  or  developmental.  New  knowledge  products  and  services  are  being \ndesigned, tailored to specific audiences.4  \n \n6.  Since 1997, broader evaluations, promotion and dissemination of evaluation products, \nand OED participation in the activities of the Evaluation Cooperation Group, have been financed \nthrough technical assistance (TA).5 Broader evaluations, which are multi-activity, multi-country, \nmulti-sector in nature, are more complex and have benefited from this responsive approach in \nproviding consulting and other services. Other components of OED\u2019s work program, in particular \npreparation of traditional project or program performance evaluation reports, have been funded \nfrom ADB\u2019s internal administrative expense budget. This pattern of resource use will continue in \n2008. An allocation of about $1.4 million for a regional TA is included in the indicative planning \nfigures for 2008.6 Selected evaluation studies to be financed under this TA will cover the 2008 \nand 2009 work programs of OED. 7 \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The impact of the TA is to help ADB, as a learning institution, to continuously improve \nthe development effectiveness of its operations and be accountable to its stakeholders. The \noutcome will be timely and practical findings and recommendations to support the formulation \nand  implementation  of  new  policies  and  procedures,  country  partnership  strategies,  and \noperations  and  business  plans,  and  projects.  The  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in \nAppendix 2. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n8.  An evaluation approach paper outlining the scope, methodology, resource requirements, \nand  terms  of  reference  (TOR)  will  be  prepared  for  each  of  the  broad  evaluations  before \nconsultants  are  engaged  and  the  studies  begun.  The  views  of  relevant  ADB  staff  and \nGovernment entities will be sought and reflected, as appropriate, in the final version of the \n                                                 \n3  To improve consistency and quality, guidelines for the evaluation of public sector projects, program loans, technical \nassistance  (February  2006),  country  assistance  programs  (February  2006),  and  private  sector  operations \n(February 2007) have been issued. \n4  The Knowledge Management Unit of OED was established in 2007. \n5 From 1997 to 2007, a total of 13 umbrella TA grants have been administered by OED. Of the thirteen, eight TAs \nhave been closed and another two substantially completed. These financed preparation of 64 broader evaluations \n(or at least 60% of major evaluations completed from 1997 to 2007) comprising 16 impact evaluations, 34 special \nevaluation studies, 11 country assistance program evaluations, and 3 sector assistance program evaluations. \nMeanwhile, two of three ongoing TAs also provide support to evaluation studies under the 2008 work program. \n6  Kuroda, H. 2008. Memorandum: Operational Resource Parameters 2008. Manila: ADB. In addition to OED\u2019s \noriginal 2008 TA resource allocation, a further $93,000 will be available through TA savings (Head, A. 2008.  \nMemorandum: Arrangements on TA Savings and Cancellations in 2008 and Reallocation of TA Savings to 2008 \nPlanning Figure. Manila: ADB). \n7  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 3 December 2007. ", "3 \nstudy. The scope and focus of the studies and other activities, as currently envisaged, are \ndescribed below. \n \n9.  Country Assistance Program Evaluation. OED is set to undertake a second country \nassistance program evaluation (CAPE) for several countries including Cambodia, Indonesia, \nNepal,  and  Viet  Nam.  The  CAPEs  will  assess  the  development  effectiveness  of  ADB\u2019s \ncompleted and continuing program and operations in light of economic, sector, institutional, and \npolitical changes that have taken place since the last CAPE.8 It will also give attention to ADB \noperations  effectiveness  in  complementing  other  development  partners.  Based  on  these \nfindings, it will derive lessons and good practices to provide ADB and the country with a basis \nfor deciding on changes in the future CPS. \n \n10.  Decentralization  in  Indonesia.  The  study  will  evaluate  the  performance  of  ADB \nassistance in relation to decentralization, keeping in mind the institutional and policy changes \nthat have taken place in Indonesia since the last CAPE, which was prepared in 2005. It will \nassess (i) the impact of decentralization on ADB country assistance strategies and programs, \nand its response; (ii) institutional issues affecting implementation; (iii) critical factors affecting \nexecuting agency capacity and performance at each government level, and related capacity \ndevelopment  efforts;  and  (iv)  the  development  effectiveness  of  ADB  assistance  for \nstrengthening  public  sector  management  capacity.  It  will  also  recommend  how  to  improve \nsupport for decentralization in Indonesia. The evaluation findings will feed into the preparation of \nthe CAPE and the next CPS. \n \n11.  Agriculture  and  Natural  Resources  SAPE  in  Nepal.  The  SAPE  will  assess  the \nperformance of ADB\u2019s assistance strategies and programs, and derive implications for future \nstrategies to support the agriculture and natural resources (ANR) sector. It will also (i) assess \nADB contributions to rural livelihoods and poverty reduction; (ii) examine how ADB support is \ninterlinked for synergy across linked sectors (e.g., rural roads in terms of access to markets); \n(iii) assess the linkages across regional TA support for ANR research to country operations; and \n(iv)  identify  lessons  and  recommendations  for  ADB\u2019s  future  operations  in  the  sector.  The \nfindings will feed into the second CAPE on Nepal, which will provide inputs to the next CPS. \n \n12.  SAPEs on the Energy and Transport Sectors in Viet Nam. ADB assistance to the \nenergy and transport sectors of Viet Nam accounts for about half of cumulative lending at the \nend of 2007 and comprises about two thirds of the firm lending pipeline for 2008\u20132010. These \nSAPEs will assess the performance of ADB\u2019s assistance strategies and programs to the energy \nand transport sectors. Particular attention will be given to (i) value addition and the development \neffectiveness of the energy and transport sectors from ADB operations in Viet Nam in view of its \nrapid growth, and (ii) ADB\u2019s management of its relationship with the Government in these \nsectors. It will examine performance of completed and ongoing assistance operations, and \nderive lessons and good practices to guide ADB\u2019s future strategy and implementation in Viet \nNam. The findings and recommendations will provide key inputs to the CAPE and the next CPS. \n \n13.  Urban Sector SAPE in Viet Nam. The SAPE aims to (i) provide a comprehensive and \nindependent assessment of the impact of ADB assistance on the sector\u2019s development and \nfinancial performance, as well as on its wider impacts on economic development and poverty \nreduction; (ii) identify lessons from the past 12 years of ADB assistance in the sector; and \n(iii) identify key challenges facing the sector, and strategies to move forward for ADB\u2019s program. \n                                                 \n8 Every CAPE study would include as appropriate: (i) a desk review of country programming and project files, reports, \nand documents; (ii) data collection and analysis; (iii) key informant interviews; (iv) focus group discussions; (v) field \nvisits; (vi) benefit monitoring and evaluation and project performance management report review, (vii) counterfactual \nevidence collection; and (viii) gathering of photographic evidence. ", "                   \n4     \nThe study will include, among others,  (i) a desk review of project files, reports, and documents; \n(ii)  data  collection  and  analysis,  in  particular  of  health  and  socioeconomic  data;  (iii)  key \ninformant  interviews;  (iv)  field  visits  and  focus  group  discussions;  and  (v)  counterfactual \nevidence collection. \n \n14.  SES  on  Effectiveness  of  ADB  Assistance  to  Rural  Connectivity  and  Inclusive \nDevelopment. Past OED evaluation findings suggest that rural roads are necessary but not \nsufficient condition for reducing poverty. On the other hand, there is a need to analyze and \nreport backward and forward development linkages caused by improved rural connectivity. This \nstudy will assess the relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability, and likely impacts of \nADB assistance in improving rural connectivity (i.e., rural roads and market infrastructure) and \ninclusive development. It will be based on a case study approach, and a value chain analysis \nframework will be adopted to assess backward and forward linkages to both economic and \nsocial services. It is expected to contribute to parallel CAPE studies as well as stimulate policy \ndebate within ADB. \n \n15.  SES on ADB Support for Public-Private Partnerships for Infrastructure and Non-\nInfrastructure Services. This SES will follow up on an ongoing public-private partnership \n(PPP) study on the infrastructure sectors to evaluate ADB\u2019s experiences and lessons. It will help \nidentify ways to enhance ADB\u2019s contribution to support private sector development through the \nuse  of  PPP  instruments.  The  phase  2  SES  will  encompass  both  infrastructure  and  non-\ninfrastructure  sectors,  including  health  and  education  among  others.  The  final  report  will \ncomprise  a  synthesis  of  issues,  lessons,  and  recommendations  drawn  from  intermediate \nevaluations on ADB\u2019s public and private sector PPP operations. The detailed scope and timing \nof this SES will be determined after completion of the ongoing PPP study (phase 1). \n \n16.  SES on Effectiveness of TA Support in Environmental Management. The SES will \nassess  ADB  support  to  capacity  development  in  environmental  management.  The  meta-\nevaluation  will  essentially  build  on  past  studies  in  environment  management  by  OED,  in \nparticular from TA performance evaluation and SES reports. \n \n17.  SES on the Effectiveness of Selected Knowledge Products. The SES will examine \nthe relevance, efficiency, and impact of selected ADB knowledge products. It will undertake \ncase studies of 4\u20135 key knowledge products produced by ADB to identify underlying systemic \nchallenges and opportunities.  \n \n18.  Rigorous Impact Evaluation. OED completed its first rigorous impact evaluation in \n2007. Bearing in mind that rigorous impact evaluations are demanding in terms of time and \nresources, OED is committed to conducting one rigorous impact evaluation annually. For the \n2008 work program, it has identified the Punjab Rural/Community Water Supply and Sanitation \nSector Project in Pakistan. The study will (i) contribute to a better understanding of project level \nimpacts (e.g., health, income, and girls\u2019 education) resulting from ADB assistance in water and \nsanitation for use in future project/sector intervention in DMCs; and (ii) build in-house capacity in \nconducting rigorous impact evaluation for subsequent studies in 2009 and onwards. \n \n19.  Knowledge Management. The experience and knowledge that ADB has gained are its \nmost important organizational assets. In 2008, following the audit of the lessons architecture \nconducted  in  2007,  OED  will  accentuate  knowledge  sharing  and  learning  with  other \ndepartments,  DMCs,  and  the  international  evaluation  community.  It  will  disseminate  the \nknowledge products developed, e.g., Learning Curves and Success Rates series (2007) and \nSector  Summation  series  (2008).  OED  will  engage  consulting  services  to  strengthen \ninternational networking, knowledge capture and storage, and other related work. ", "5 \n20.  Joint Evaluations. OED will carry out two joint evaluations under this regional TA (out \nof the three programmed for 2008 with partner development agencies \u2212 Appendix 3). \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n21.  The cost of the TA is estimated at $1.493 million. It will be financed on a grant basis from \nADB\u2019s TA funding program. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 4. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n22.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA, which will be implemented and supervised \nby OED. Based on experience with similar studies in the past, about 40 person-months of \ninternational  and  about  70  person-months  of  national  consulting  services  will  be  required. \nOutline terms of reference are in Appendix 5. Detailed terms of reference will be developed in \nthe  evaluation  approach  papers  before  action  is  taken  to  engage  consultants.  Except  as \nspecified  in  paragraph  23  below,  consultants  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \n23.  ADB will provide an amount not exceeding $50,000 for a Joint Agency Evaluation of \nAnticorruption Efforts, which is funded jointly by five other agencies, including the Norwegian \nAgency for Development Cooperation (Norad) (para. 20). ADB will enter into an agreement with \nNorad, the lead implementing agency. Consultants for this joint evaluation will be recruited and \nadministered by Norad following its procedures but acceptable to all participating development \nagencies. As this evaluation will be global in scope and the contributions of all participants are \nmade  on  a  joint  basis,  it  is  possible  that  the  successful  consulting  firm  and  some  of  the \nindividual  consultants  may  not  be  from  an  ADB  member  country.  Accordingly,  it  is \nrecommended in paragraph 26 below that the Board of Directors approve an exception to the \nprocurement  restrictions  provided  under  Article  14  (ix)  of  the  Charter  for  the  joint  agency \nevaluation of anti-corruption efforts.  \n \n24.  The TA will start in July 2008 and will be completed in December 2010. Implementation \narrangements will be flexible enough to allow changes should OED\u2019s work program be altered, \nincluding as needed to respond to priorities under the long-term strategic framework, 2008\u2013\n2020 (Strategy 2020)9 and the Asian Development Fund X. \n \nIV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n25.  It is recommended that the Board approve the provision of technical assistance not \nexceeding the equivalent of $1,493,000 on a grant basis for Selected Evaluation Studies for \n2008. \n \n26.  To facilitate ADB cooperation with Norad during the phase 2 country assessments of the \njoint evaluation on anti-corruption efforts, it is recommended that the Board approve: (i) the \nselection and recruitment of consultants for the Joint Agency Evaluation of Anticorruption Efforts \nreferred to in paragraph 23 above in accordance with the rules and procedures of Norad; and (ii) \nby a vote of the Directors representing not less than two thirds of the total voting power of the \nmembers,  the  procurement  of  consulting  services  for  the  Joint  Agency  Evaluation  of \nAnticorruption Efforts referred to in paragraph 23 above in ADB member and non-member \ncountries. \n                                                 \n9 ADB. 2008.

Implementation arrangements will \nbe flexible enough to allow changes should OED\u2019s work be altered. \n \n2.  Joint Agency Evaluation of Anticorruption Efforts. In 2007, in the context of Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB) membership of the Development Assistance Committee\u2019s Network \nof  Development  Evaluation,  OED  agreed  to  participate  in  a  joint  agency  evaluation  of \nanticorruption efforts proposed by the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad). \nIn addition to ADB, four development partners have joined Norad in this evaluation: Danish \nInternational  Development  Agency,  Swedish  Agency  for  Development  Evaluation,  Swedish \nInternational  Development  Agency,  and  United  Kingdom  Department  for  International \nDevelopment.  The  main  purpose  of  this  joint  evaluation  is  to  identify  good  practice \nanticorruption efforts by analyzing what interventions work, under what conditions. \n \n3.  The  study  is  being  conducted  in  two  phases.  Phase  1  is  a  pre-study  assessment \nincluding  a  literature  review,  mapping  of  development  partners\u2019  anticorruption  efforts,  and \ndevelopment of an evaluation framework. Based on the findings of the pre-study, phase II \ncountry assessments will be undertaken. It is expected that at least two countries in the Asia \nand Pacific region will be selected along with countries in Africa, Europe, and Latin America. \nThe study would complement a special evaluation study (SES) on the implementation of ADB\u2019s \ngovernance and anticorruption policies (included in OED\u2019s 2009 work program) by providing \nglobal comparator information against ADB\u2019s Asia-Pacific regional focus.  \n \n4.  For this particular study, ADB will enter into a separate agreement with Norad which is \nthe  lead  implementing  agency  of  this  joint  evaluation  for  all  the  participating  development \nagencies. The six partner agencies have established a management group that is mandated to \nmanage the joint evaluation, with Norad responsible for administration\u2014including contracting \ninternational consultant firms for each phase, following its procurement procedures. The work \nwill be cofinanced equally by the participating development agencies on a joint basis. ADB is \nexpected to contribute up to $50,000 during the phase 2 country assessments. Consultant \nrecruitment  will  be  administered  by  Norad  following  its  procedures  but  acceptable  to  all \nparticipating development agencies. As phase 2 will be global in scope, it is possible that the \nsuccessful firm and some of its nominated consultants will not be from ADB member countries.  \n \n5.  Second Phase Evaluation of Implementation of the Paris Declaration at ADB. The \nfirst phase conducted an evaluation of the actions that ADB has taken to align to the Paris \nDeclaration commitments to contribute to the joint Organisation for Economic Co-operation and \nDevelopment \u2013 Development Assistance Committee first phase evaluation of progress made in \nthe implementation of the Paris Declaration. The second phase will be conducted to assess the \nlinkages between aid effectiveness and development results, whether the intended long-term \neffects of the Paris agenda are being achieved. The second phase evaluation is expected to \nstart from the time of the forthcoming Third High level Forum in Accra, Ghana in 2008 and will \n                                                 \n1 As an example, OED contributes to the work of the Evaluation Cooperation Group (ECG). It (i) takes part in \nbenchmarking studies, e.g., for public sector investments and other modalities for which good practices standards \nare available; (ii) develops good-practice standards to promote harmonization; (iii) helps build the ECG database; \nand (iv) undertakes joint papers that draw together the evaluation functions of ECG members.
