During the 2006 Country Programming Mission, the Government of the People\u2019s Republic \nof China (PRC) requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide assistance for preparing \nthe Integrated Renewable Biomass Energy Development Project in five participating provinces of \nHeilongjiang, Henan, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, and Shanxi. The project preparatory technical assistance \n(PPTA) will prepare a project to meet PRC\u2019s goals of improving ecological agriculture, promoting \nrenewable  energy,  and  addressing  ADB\u2019s  overarching  goals  of  poverty  reduction  and \nenvironmental sustainability. The concept paper was approved by the Vice President and included \nin the country strategy and program update.1 \n \n2.  At the request of the Government, ADB fielded a fact-finding mission in January 2007. The \nMission  held  discussions  with  representatives  of  the  Government  and  the  five  provinces. \nUnderstanding  was  reached  on  the  TA  impact,  outcome,  implementation  arrangements,  cost \nestimates, and consultant\u2019s terms of reference. The TA design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1.2  \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  PRC is still largely rural, with abundant biomass resources including agricultural (crop and \nagro-processing) residues, and animal wastes amounting to about 2.5 billion tons per annum, of \nwhich 70% is livestock waste. These resources have enormous potential for sustainable production \nof bio-energy but are presently underutilized or used in ways that severely pollute the environment. \nThe National Strategy for Renewable Rural Biomass Energy Development3 is due for completion in \nNovember 2007. The strategy will provide a framework to sustainably utilize these resources as \nwell as develop additional resources for renewable energy production as part of the Government\u2019s \nobjective of constructing a new countryside, reducing reliance on fossil fuels, and significantly \nreducing environmental pollution.    \n4.  Regarding livestock wastes, the Government has taken steps to strengthen regulation on \nemissions from medium- and large-scale production enterprises, which are the main polluters. To \ncomply with these regulations, under current economic and regulatory conditions, the least-cost \nresponse for most enterprises will be the installation of conventional, \u201cend of pipe\u201d waste treatment \nfacilities (anaerobic lagoons).4 This will achieve the objectives of the pollution control regulation but \nwill also: (i) increase greenhouse gas emissions, thus exacerbating global climate change; and \n(ii) significantly reduce the availability of resources to generate renewable energy consistent with \nthe National Strategy for Renewable Rural Biomass Energy Development. \n5.  Rural medium- and large-sized biogas digester establishment integrated with eco-agriculture \nsystems is a sensible and cost-effective way to address both rural energy gaps and the rural \nnonpoint source pollution problem. Biogas is generated from animal wastes (the end result of the \ncarbohydrate animal feed, which is produced from solar energy through photosynthesis) in an \nanaerobic condition. Integrated biogas technology has been used to encourage efficient use of \nnutrients, production of clean energy, lowering of farming costs, and opportunities for organic \nfarming. The Government has provided exceptionally strong impetus to rural biogas renewable \nenergy development in the 11th Five-Year Plan passed by the People\u2019s Congress in February 2006. \nAdditionally, the Government promulgated its Number 1 Policy Document on 21 February 2006 \nentitled Decision on New Countryside Development, emphasizing that biogas system development in \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006. Country Strategy and Program Update 2007\u20132008. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 21 March 2007. \n3  This activity is now supported by ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Preparing the \nNational Strategy for Rural Biomass Renewable Energy Development Project. Manila (TA 4810-PRC, approved on \n26 June 2006). \n4  Anaerobic lagoons are major sources of methane.\n  \n ", "2   \nrural areas as an important element. The results of the New Countryside Development are expected \nto be (i) advanced production methods, (ii) improved livelihoods, (iii) a civilized social atmosphere, \n(iv) clean and tidy villages, and (v) democratic management. The first, second, and fourth areas will \nbenefit from the rural biogas system development. \n \n6.  PRC is in the process of developing and strengthening regulations to reduce the negative \nenvironmental  impact  of  intensive  livestock  production,  and  intends  to  use  a  combination  of \nregulations and economic instruments. In 1996, the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) introduced a \nregulation requiring all new large-scale livestock farms to establish manure storage facilities. In \n1998, the State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) began to evaluate pollution from \nlivestock  production,  and  in  1999,  a  new  division  focusing  on  environmental  pollution  from \nagriculture was established. In May 2001, the Government established environmental management \nregulations  for  the  livestock  industry,  and  in  January  2002,  it  established  pollutant  emission \nstandards with regard to the breeding industry.5 A new regulation by SEPA on \u201cPollution Material \nEmission  Standard  for  Animal  and  Poultry  Industry\u201d  became  effective  on  1  January  2003. \nAdditionally, the Government\u2019s program on renewable energy promotes the formulation of biogas \nfrom livestock waste.  \n \n7.  ADB\u2019s  ongoing  project,  Efficient  Utilization  of  Agricultural  Wastes  Project6  in  the  four \nprovinces of Henan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Shanxi, is supporting the construction of over 19,000 \nsmall household biogas digesters and 16 medium- and large-sized livestock biogas plants. A pilot \nclean development mechanism (CDM) project has also been implemented in Henan province for \n12 pig farms. In addition to the physical implementation of various types of technologies, this \nproject has played a catalytic role in rural household biogas system development. Since technical \nassistance (TA) development in 2000, awareness of household biogas system development has \nexpanded  at  both  the  national  and  provincial  levels.  Project  activities,  ongoing  consultations, \npromotion and communication strategies, and ongoing government engagement have supported \nincreased understanding of the multiple benefits of the household biogas system. In the areas \nwhere the project has operated, adoption and engagement by farmers have been dramatic.  \n \n8.  The experiences learned from the implementation of Efficient Utilization of Agricultural \nWastes Project show the need for: (i) the continuous promotion of local and national awareness of \nthe advantages of the household biogas system development; (ii) extensive technical support and \ntraining  provided  to  establish  adequate  technical  services  to  ensure  the  sustainability  of \nestablished household biogas systems; and (iii) an energy and environmental monitoring plan \nimplemented to monitor the impacts on air, water, and soil quality.  \n \n9.  Having supported the successful development of rural household biogas systems in PRC, \nthrough the implementation of Efficient Utilization of Agricultural Wastes Project, it is evident that \nsignificant barriers exist for the development of medium-sized biogas digester systems for livestock \nfarms. These barriers include the following: \n \n(i)  No  specific  policy  instruments  exist  to  promote  commercial  implementation  of \nanaerobic digester system for intensive livestock wastes treatment. The medium-\nsized  biogas  system  is  capital-intensive  and  not  economically  viable  under  the \ncurrent conditions; it would require additional financing through mechanisms such \nas CDM. The Renewable Energy Law favors the establishment of large-scale power \n                                                 \n5  Specific laws and regulations are: Law of Environmental Protection, 1989; Decree on Control and Management of \nPollution by Livestock Production (SEPA Decree 9 \u2013 May 2001); and Standards for Waste Discharge from Livestock \nProduction (GB18596-2001). \n6  ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China for the Efficient Utilization of Agricultural Wastes Project. Manila. (Loan 1924-PRC, for \n$33.1 million, approved on 22 October 2002). ", "  3\ngenerators, only allowing the generators beyond 500 kilowatts to connect with grid, \nbut most medium-sized biogas digesters can just generate 50\u2013150 kilowatts of \nelectricity.  \n(ii)  Current national and provincial financial sources, and rural energy support services \nhave  been  heavily  preoccupied  by  household  biogas  digesters,  and  insufficient \nattention has been paid to medium- and large-sized biogas systems although the \nlatter is widely recognized as the future direction of rural energy development. \n(iii)  There  are  inadequate  technical  support  services  for  medium  and  large  biogas \nsystems,  which  lead  to  poor  maintenance  and  a  shortened  life.  As  a  result, \nestablished biogas systems in some provinces have stopped operating. In addition, \nthere is a shortage of capable design engineers because most of the engineers \ninvolved  with  medium-scale  digester  design  used  to  work  on  the  industrial \nwastewater treatment process, and do not have enough experience to deal with the \ncomplicated  physical  and  chemical  features  of  animal  manures.  This  limited \ntechnical capacity creates a bottleneck, limiting the rapid development of medium- \nand large-sized biogas digesters. \n(iv)  There  are  insufficient  technical  standards  and  procedures  to  ensure  effective \nengineering design, construction, and operation of medium- and large-sized biogas \nsystems.  It  is  necessary  to  establish  the  guidelines  for  technical  support  and \nservices  for  quality  control  of  these  systems,  including,  for  example,  design, \nengineering, operation and maintenance, and project implementation management. \nGuidelines  and  specifications  for  the  economic  characteristics,  diversity,  and \nsuitability  of  existing  technology  options  to  local  situations  will  ensure  the \neffectiveness of the operation of medium- and large-scale biogas systems. \n(v)  Lack of enforcement of environmental laws at the local level because of economic \npressure from the livestock operations has led many provinces to assume that direct \ndischarge to anaerobic lagoons is the only solution.  \n(vi)  Lack  of  cooperation  between  responsible  agencies  and  lack  of  coordinated \ninstitutional  arrangements  result  in  different  agencies  promoting  different \ntechnologies through different financial sources. \n(vii)  An appropriate mechanism or agroecological system to dispose of all the liquid and \nsolid effluents from the biogas digester onto farmers\u2019 fields should be tested and \npiloted. Otherwise, a high risk of secondary pollution from biogas establishment will \noccur.  \n10.  Promoting environmental improvement and clean energy is one of the strategic areas in the \n2007\u20132008 country strategy and program update for ADB\u2019s operations in PRC. The proposed \nProject will aim at removing the above barriers by increasing rural renewable energy services, \nreducing pollution from animal wastes, and developing the practice of utilizing biogas energy and \nsludge by-products. \n  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact of the TA is reduced pollution from animal wastes through the sustainable use \nof biogas energy and fertilizer by-products. The outcome of the TA will be a project design for a \nloan, which responds to clients\u2019 needs and fulfills ADB requirements and safeguard policies. The \nTA will assist the Government in preparing an investment project based on the Government\u2019s initial \nproposal to address the technical, financial, and institutional barriers. The Project is expected to \n ", "4   \ntransform the market for waste treatment at intensive livestock and poultry farms through the \nsustainable implementation of anaerobic digester (biogas) systems by integrating the ecological \nagricultural  practices,  technology  service  systems,  and  demonstrating  replicable  economic \nincentives based on carbon finance.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will be implemented in two phases using a fully participatory approach. During the \nfirst  phase,  the  consultant  team  will  (i)  conduct  assessments  of  sector  policy,  institutions, \nstrategies, and plans; (ii) appraise the project proposals from the Government; (iii) assess the wide \nrange  of  problems  constraining  eco-agricultural  development,  including  analysis  of  biogas \ntechnology options; (iv) undertake wider stakeholder consultations and conduct social, poverty, \ninstitutional,  environmental,  and  other  necessary  assessments  and  surveys;  (v)  evaluate  the \nimpact of the ongoing program in eco-agricultural development, including lessons learned; and (vi) \nbased on assessments and surveys, in consultation with the stakeholders, confirm the project \nrationale, scope, and approach, which should be reflected in the project design and monitoring \nframework.  Phase one reviews and assessments need to clearly demonstrate the economic \nrationale for the proposed investment as a public sector operation, in terms of addressing failures \nor limitation of markets. \n13.  During the second phase, in consultation with the stakeholders, the consultant team will \nprepare a comprehensive feasibility report. The report will cover in detail project impact, outcome, \noutputs,  and  activities\u2014including  financial,  economic,  social,  and  environmental  safeguards; \nrelevant  sector  analysis;  the  role  and  institutional  capacity  of  key  participating  agencies; \nprocurement; implementation arrangements; and crosscutting issues of poverty reduction, gender, \ngood governance, and private sector development. Consultants will also be engaged to assist in \ndeveloping CDM projects for all eligible subprojects among estimated 300 subprojects in five \nprovinces. Key activities for each output are included in the TA design and monitoring framework \n(Appendix 1). \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $990,000 equivalent, of which the Government \nrequested ADB to finance $650,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from \nADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government will contribute $340,000 in kind for office space, \ncounterpart staff, site transportation, and other services. Details of the cost estimates for the TA \nare provided in Appendix 2. The Government has been informed that approval of the TA does not \ncommit ADB to finance any ensuing project.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  MOA, which has extensive experience in administering externally assisted projects, will be \nthe Executing Agency (EA) for the TA. A steering committee will be established and chaired by the \nvice minister of MOA, comprising senior officials from the Department of Development Planning; \nDepartment  of  Research,  Education  and  Rural  Environment;  and  the  Foreign  Economic \nCooperation Center (FECC). The steering committee will meet monthly to guide and support the \nTA team in the project preparation. \n \n16.  A TA management office (TMO) will be established in the FECC to carry out day-to-day TA \noperations. The director of the Rural Energy Division at Department of Research, Education and \nRural Environment of MOA will serve as the head of the TMO and function as the overall TA \ncoordinator. The FECC, through TMO, will execute the TA implementation; and be responsible for \nday-to-day  communications  and  operational  matters  among  ADB,  consultants,  and  related ", "  5\ngovernment agencies. The director of the Agriculture Division for FECC of MOA will serve as the \nexecutive director of the TMO, and lead a task force in FECC to be responsible for the preparation \nof proposals, feasibility studies, and safeguard documents (environment and social) for the whole \nProject under the close guidance of the Rural Energy Division and the steering committee.  \n \n17.  Five TA implementation offices will be established in the respective agriculture departments \nof  Heilongjiang,  Henan,  Jiangsu,  Jiangxi,  and  Shanxi.  These  implementation  offices  will  be \nadequately equipped with qualified staff and financial resources. They will be responsible for \nsubproject identification; provincial data collection; and preparation of provincial project proposals, \nfeasibility studies, and safeguard documentation.  \n \n18.  A  national  project  coordination  committee  will  be  established  in  Beijing  and  include \nrepresentatives  from  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  MOA,  National  Development  and  Reform \nCommission, SEPA, and other agencies concerned to strengthen interagency coordination. \n \n19.  At  the  provincial  level,  the  provincial  project  steering  committee,  consisting  of \nrepresentatives from the Agriculture Bureau, Provincial Financial Bureau, Provincial Development \nand Reform Committee, Provincial Environmental Protection Bureau, and other relevant groups will \nbe established. It will be led by a vice-governor, who is in charge of agriculture development.  \n \n20.  The TMO, in consultation with the national and provincial steering committees and TA \nimplementation  offices,  will  provide  the  necessary  guidance,  and  mobilize  the  appropriate \nconsultants to review provincial and national project design documents (subprojects, environment, \nCDM, etc.) developed by the local provinces and the National Design Institute. \n \n21.  Implementation of the TA will take 6 months, which will be structured in two phases. The \nfirst phase is expected to be implemented from August to October 2007, while the second phase \nwill be carried out from November 2007 to January 2008. \n \n22.  A total of 14 person-months of international and 40 person-months of national consulting \nservices are required. The draft outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. A \nconsulting firm will be engaged for all services including CDM related services according to ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2006,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB. ADB will select and engage consultants on the basis of the \nquality of their proposals and the cost of the services to be provided (with quality cost ratio of \n80:20),  following  simplified  technical  proposal  procedures.  The  consultants  will  submit  (i)  an \ninception report 4 weeks after commencement of their services, (ii) an interim progress report \nwithin 12 weeks of TA implementation, (iii) draft final report within 20 weeks, and (iv) a final report \nwithin 24 weeks, after incorporating EA\u2019s and ADB's comments.7 Equipment for the TA will be \nprocured by the consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2006, as amended \nfrom time to time), and will be handed over to the EA upon completion of the TA.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n23.  The  President,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  by  the  Board,  has  approved  the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $650,000 on a grant basis to the \nGovernment of the People\u2019s Republic of China for preparing the Integrated Renewable Biomass \nEnergy Development Project, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n7  All reports must be submitted in English and Chinese.  \n ", " 6  Appendix 1       \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumption \n       \nReduced pollution from  Annual production of  Provincial statistics  \u2022  Government policies \nanimal wastes and  biogas (million cubic    continue to promote rural \nsustainable use of biogas  meters) is increased  Project monitoring reports  renewable energy \nenergy and fertilizer      \nby-products    Risk \n\u2022  Inadequate financial \nincentives for the private \nsector to invest in \nsustainable livestock waste \nmanagement \n \nOutcome      Assumption \n       \nProject design for a loan  Agreement reached  MOU signed by the  \u2022  Effective collaboration and \nthat responds to the  between the Government  Government of PRC, EA, and  communication among the \nclients\u2019 needs, and fulfills  of PRC and ADB on the  ADB  key government agencies \nADB requirements and  final loan project design   \nsafeguard policies  by January 2008  Risk \n    \u2022  Provincial project pre-\nfeasibility studies are not \ncompleted to an adequate \nlevel of quality and detail \nbefore mobilization of the \nPPTA consultants \nOutputs      Assumption \n       \nSituation analysis and  Inception report (week 4)  Project reports  \u2022  PPTA consulting team \ntechnical assessments    MOU/aide-memoire and  given access to required \ncompleted    back-to-office report from TA  data.  \n  EA, ADB, and proposed  review missions   \n  IAs agree with strategy     \nProject rationale,  proposed by PPTA  MOU \napproach, and strategy  consulting team (week 10)   \nagreed on  Interim report (week 12)   \n     \n     \nDetailed feasibility study  Draft final report  Project reports \naccomplished  (week 20)  MOU/aide-memoire and \n    back-to-office reports from TA \nFinal report (week 24)  \n  review missions \nActivities with Milestones   Inputs  \n   \n1.1  Analyze relevant baseline surveys and reports, current situation in livestock waste  \u2022  ADB: $650,000 \nmanagement, and growth potential in livestock industry development in the project   \nareas (by week 2).
