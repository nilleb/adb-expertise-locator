The rapid pace of infrastructure development in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) is \nconducive to increased mobility of goods and people among the six countries that make up the \nGMS, namely, Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Thailand, Viet Nam, \nand Yunnan province of the People's Republic of China. The region\u2019s road and bridge networks \nhave created significant opportunities for increased trade and investment in the context of the \nindividual  countries\u2019  progressive  transition  from  centrally  planned  to  market  economies. \nMechanisms to facilitate cross-border trade and investment have emerged as an important area \nfor regional cooperation, in order to attract GMS-wide foreign direct investment (FDI) flows and \nthus facilitate international market access by the region\u2019s private sector.1 The modalities for \npolicy coordination and cooperation on scope of reform are key to addressing the ongoing \nimpediments to trade and investment. Examples of such impediments in relation to trade are (i) \na fragmented trade logistics network characterized by high transport costs and unreliable \ndelivery schedules due to cumbersome procedures, high import and export clearance charges \nat customs control points, and the absence of regional freight forwarding; and (ii) the existence \nof bilateral border trade agreements whose provisions are not consistently applied across all the \nGMS  economies.  In  relation  to  investment,  the  impediments  include  (i)  the  absence  of \nconsolidated  information  on  the  region\u2019s  investment  rules  and  regulations,  and  (ii)  weak \nsubregional private sector organizations that could facilitate exchanges of information on trade \nand investment opportunities. The advisory technical assistance (TA) seeks to address some of \nthese constraints.2 The TA is included in ADB\u2019s GMS Regional Cooperation Strategy and \nProgram (2004-2008).3 GMS Governments have indicated their concurrence with the goals of \nthe TA. \n  \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The sustained economic growth of the GMS requires a consistent improvement in the \ntrade and investment environment to increase the dynamism of the private sector. Even though \nindividual GMS economies have introduced measures to reform their trade and investment \npolicy regimes in recent years,4 the size of their domestic markets and of related production \ncapacities have constrained efforts to develop a competitive manufacturing base. In order to \nenhance the competitiveness of the subregion in global markets, the GMS economies have \nrecognized the need to maximize the advantage offered by their contiguous location and \nconnectivity so as to facilitate regional contractual linkages and entry into large-scale export \nactivities.  \n \n                                                 \n1  GMS policymakers have asked the Asian Development Bank to review the constraints and opportunities that \nregional cooperation can address in the endeavor to enhance participation by each country in cross-border and \nglobal value chains.  \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities internet edition on 6 September 2004. \n3  Formerly listed in the Regional Cooperation Strategy Program (2004-2008) as the GMS Trade and Investment \nFacilitation. \n4  The rate of reduction of tariff and nontariff barriers is subject to commitments made under regional (Association of \nSoutheast Asian Nations or ASEAN) or multilateral (World Trade Organization) trading arrangements. The \nCommon Effective Preferential Tariff (Agreement for the ASEAN Free Trade Area) requires the harmonization of \nthe tariff nomenclatures of all ASEAN member countries. This was achieved on 1 July 2003.  ", "2  \n3.  The emerging feature of international production, trade, and investment activities is the \nlevel of specialization and decentralization among firms and coordination among policymakers.5 \nInternational production networks are becoming geographically decentralized value chains6 that \ncoordinate production among or within firms.7 The integrating mechanisms whereby these \ninternational production networks establish linkages between intermediaries are increasingly \nbased on contract manufacturing, marketing contracts, as well as licensing and involve common \ntechnical standards and shared product-or process-related standards. To facilitate cross-border \ninvestment in the GMS and create opportunities for GMS enterprises to, for example, produce \nfor component exports, policymakers will need to consider the potential positive externalities \narising from collective action in creating consistent national enabling environments. Among the \nissues for policymakers to consider in relation to making the GMS an attractive destination for \nFDI, the following are key: (i) policy and regulatory frameworks related to FDI promotion, i.e., \ninvestment laws, double taxation agreements, standards, and dispute settlement mechanisms; \n(ii) trade facilitation, including customs clearance, import and export documentary procedures, \nstandards,  logistics  systems,  preshipment  finance,  and  insurance;  and  (iii)  institutional \nmechanisms that enable information flows and feedback between domestic and international \ninvestors and GMS policymakers, industry associations, and enterprises to streamline policy.  \n  \n4.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has provided assistance in the area of cross-border \ntrade and investment facilitation in the context of its GMS Economic Cooperation Program.8 \nADB has also provided policy and analytical support to GMS investment promotion and trade \nfacilitation experts through the GMS Subregional Investment Working Group and the GMS \nTrade  Facilitation  Working  Group.  In  the  area  of  capacity  building  for  the  institutional \ndevelopment of the GMS Business Forum,9 ADB has  been coordinating assistance with the \nUnited Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP). In the \nnear future, the GMS Business Forum can play an important role in (i) benchmarking legal and \nregulatory regimes across the GMS and identifying institutional gaps, (ii) achieving economies \nof scale in the provision of value-added business services on a cost-recovery basis, and (iii) \nserving  as  a  central  location  for  policy  and  project  feedback  from  potential  international \ninvestors on the investment climate in the GMS. \n \n5.  The GMS Business Forum is an independent, nonprofit association that consists of \nrepresentatives of national chambers of commerce and industry or their equivalents from the six \nGMS economies as core members and members of the board of directors, along with associate \nand corporate members. The GMS Business Forum was established in October 2000 with \nfinancial and technical assistance from ADB and UNESCAP in response to the growing need to \nsupport  the  GMS  Economic  Cooperation  Program  and  to  engage  the  private  sector  in \nimplementing  subregional  initiatives.10  Appendix  1  present  the  GMS  Business  Forum\u2019s \ncorporate strategy and business plan. \n                                                 \n5  In response to heightened competition and related pressures to lower costs, increase quality, reduce delivery \ntimes, and continue to innovate, firms are reorganizing activities around their core competencies, which involves \nsplitting activities and moving production segments, marketing, and distribution systems according to geographical \nadvantage. \n6  A value chain refers to the full range of value-added activities required to bring a product from its conception, \nthough design, sourcing of raw materials and intermediate inputs, marketing, distribution, and support to the final \nconsumer.  \n7  In sectors such as electronics, computers, automobiles, garments, shoes, and agro-industrial products. \n8  See the GMS Development Matrix Projects at http://www.adb.org/GMS/Projects/default.asp. \n9  The  creation  of  this  platform  for  ongoing  private-public  dialogue,  has  the  potential  to  facilitate  continuous \ninstitutional change toward greater cross-border trade and investment in the GMS. \n10 Previous ADB TA has supported the GMS Business Forum (ADB. 2002.  Technical Assistance for Facilitating \nCross-Border Trade and Investment for Small and Medium Enterprise Development in the Greater Mekong ", "  3\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n6.  The primary purpose of the TA is to promote the competitiveness of GMS enterprises by \n(i) supporting a revitalized organizational model of the GMS Business Forum to facilitate a \nmainstreamed, institutionalized, and systematic policy dialogue between governments and the \nprivate sector on ways to promote trade and investment in the GMS; (ii) undertaking a study of \nthe trade logistics network along selected economic corridors for review by the GMS Business \nForum and the GMS working groups; and (iii) strengthening the development of sustainable, \npro-business services in the GMS Business Forum. Appendix 2 sets out the TA framework.  \n \n7.  This purpose will be addressed through three components.11 The first component will \nsupport the development of the GMS Business Forum into a sustainable organization by helping \nit become (i) a legally registered organization with a corporate governance framework that \nmeets international good practice so as to facilitate participation by international corporations \nand external funding agencies, (ii) a sustainable organization that provides trade and investment \nservices to its client base on a full or partial cost-recovery basis, and (iii) a forum to coordinate \nthe analysis of cross-border policy and regulatory mechanisms. This component will assist the \nGMS Business Forum to implement a credible and sustainable pro-business corporate strategy \nand business plan. \n \n8.  The second component will implement the findings of the  trade logistics study12 and \nidentify policy constraints for review with governments and the private sector. This component \nincludes a review of the trade logistics network along the east-west economic corridor and the \nnorth-south economic corridor to identify the constraints and costs of delays in the logistics \nchain and identify mechanisms for improving financial returns to investments. The study will be \nundertaken under the aegis of the GMS Business Forum, and a road map of policy reforms and \nimplementation actions will be reviewed with policymakers and the private sector in the GMS \nworking groups, as well as at conferences organized by the GMS Business Forum. The study \nwill also identify development projects to facilitate the movement of goods and services along \nthe economic corridors. \n \n9.  The  third  component  will  support  activities  that  will  promote  the  credibility  and \nsustainability of the GMS Business Forum. Eligible activities will take various forms and TA \nsupport will be contingent upon the assurance that cost recovery can be reasonably assumed \nex ante.  The various business service activities undertaken in support of the GMS Business \nForum\u2019s clients may include (i) developing a web-based Yellow Pages of enterprises in the \nGMS; (ii) implementing a web-based trade hub on supply chain linkages, (iii) developing one-\nstop counseling services and trade facilitation services for small and medium enterprises, (iv) \norganizing conferences on such topics as improving the intra-GMS flow of goods and services, \n(v) developing a web-based foreign direct investment handbook (GMS at a Glance), and (vi) \n                                                                                                                                                             \nSubregion. Manila [RETA 6020, $600,000 approved in 21 December 2002]). TA support included the initial \ndevelopment of products and services for assisting small and medium enterprises, hands-on training for the GMS \nBusiness Forum Secretariat staff to build capacity, potential matching of business opportunities at the industry or \nenterprise level, and a conference.  \n11 The three components were based on project proposals endorsed at the Third Meeting of the Trade Facilitation \nWorking Group in December 2003, the Fourth Meeting of the Subregional Investment Working Group in July 2004, \nthe Public-Private Sector Consultation Meeting in September 2004, and the First Meeting of the GMS Business \nForum\u2019s board of directors on 30 April 2004. \n12 In 2001, ADB undertook an analysis of the region\u2019s freight forwarding industry as part of the pre-investment study \nfor the eastern part of the east-west economic corridor. \n ", "4  \nengaging in customized research to meet private sector clients\u2019 needs. The GMS Business \nForum Secretariat will manage the design and implementation of the many subcomponents of \nclient services under the direction of its board of directors (See Appendix 1 on GMS-BF \ncorporate governance framework). \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The  scope  of  policy  discussions  to  be  implemented  in  the  GMS  Business  Forum \nincludes  the  following:  (i)  reviewing  cross-border  supply  chain  competencies  and \ncomplementarities by major sectors, (ii) streamlining and upgrading GMS logistics systems, (iii) \nintroducing  reciprocal  recognition  of  licensing  and  standards  frameworks,  (iv)  streamlining \ncross-border customs procedures, (v) initiating reciprocal dispute settlement mechanisms, and \n(vi) developing double taxation treaties. The GMS Business Forum will act as a forum to provide \nfeedback to GMS policymakers and industry associations on the requirements for facilitating \ninvestment  and  improving  market  access.  These  issues  will  be  developed  into  topics  for \nconferences13 organized by the GMS Business Forum on a cost-recovery basis for regional and \ninternational investors.  \n \n11.  Core members of the GMS Business Forum, UNESCAP, and ADB reviewed and agreed \nto the forum\u2019s revitalized institutional, financial, and corporate governance framework on 30 \nApril 2004. The activities approved to support the development of the GMS Business Forum into \na sustainable organization include (i) the legal registration of the GMS Business Forum as an \nindependent, nonprofit organization, including the adoption of its articles of association by the \nboard of directors, ADB, and UNESCAP; (ii) the implementation of GMS Business Forum \nservices on a cost-recovery basis and supported by funding from the national chambers of \ncommerce and industry, external funding agencies, and new members of the GMS Business \nForum; (iii) the staffing and capacity building of the GMS Business Forum Secretariat; and (iv) \nthe certification of the corporate governance framework of 30 April 2004 by an internationally \nrecognized body. The TA will also cover the operational expenses of the GMS Business Forum \nSecretariat, including staff salaries, rentals, communications, and travel expenses, during the 30 \nmonths of the TA up to $195,000 or $6,500 per month. As the GMS Business Forum generates \nviable activities from its services to clients, expands its membership, and moves towards self-\nsustainability, expectations are that the fee-based services will cover its expenses. \n \n12.   The trade logistics study, conducted in coordination with the GMS Business Forum \nSecretariat, will permit identification of the major constraints along the supply chains of the \neconomic corridors and allow a review of the scope of policy reforms that will address the high \ncosts of trade. Areas to be reviewed include transport, handling, border crossing, transit time, \nstorage, capital carrying costs in transit and storage, availability of pre-shipment finance and \ninsurance, and development of multimodal transport.  \n \n13.  Another activity that may be eligible to receive support from the proposed TA is the FDI \nweb-based handbook\u2014GMS at a Glance\u2014to be posted on the GMS Business Forum\u2019s web \nsite. The handbook would provide international and regional investors with a tool for assessing \nthe cross-border investment environment on a sector-specific basis in the GMS. The GMS \n                                                 \n13 Among the topics for development are: (i) East-West Economic Corridor and Improving the Intra-GMS Flow of \nGoods and Services, (ii) Foreign Direct Investment Environment in the GMS, (iii) Role of Pre-Shipment Export \nFinance in Improving the Intra-GMS Flow of Goods and Services, (iv) Developing Specialized Risk Underwriting, \nInsuring and Reinsuring in the GMS, (v) Achieving Internationally Accepted Technical Standards in the GMS, (vi) \nStrengthening Linkages between Securities Markets in the GMS, (vii) Developing Asset-Backed Securitization in \nthe GMS, and (viii) Labour Mobility in the GMS. ", "  5\nBusiness Forum will act as a policy forum to provide GMS investment agencies, foreign direct \ninvestors, and regional chambers of commerce and industry with feedback on the similarities \nand differences in investment laws and regulations and available risk mitigation mechanisms. \nThe web-based handbook will be linked to the web sites of regional investment agencies.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $700,000 equivalent. ADB will finance the cost of $600,000 \non  a  grant  basis  from  the  Japan  Special  Fund,  funded  by  the  Government  of  Japan. \nParticipating governments will finance the remaining $100,000 equivalent on a pro-rata basis, in \nkind, for amounts equal to imputed value of staff time and use of government facilities. The cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3.  \n \nD.   Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  ADB  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  TA.  The  implementing  agency  is  the  GMS \nBusiness Forum, supported administratively by the GMS Business Forum Secretariat and under \nthe strategic direction and guidance of its core members and the external funding agencies. The \nTA will be implemented over a period of 30 months from January 2005 to June 2007. The TA \nwill engage 13 person-months of international consulting services to help implement the first \ncomponent of the TA. The domestic consultants, that is, the secretariat staff, will be engaged for \na period of 30 months each for a total of 120 months. Other fixed overhead costs will include the \ncosts of equipment, rentals, communications, and travel. The second component of the TA, the \ntrade logistics study, will require 6 person-months of an international trade logistics expert. The \nindividual international consultants will be selected in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic \nconsultants. All procurement under the TA will be in accordance with ADB's  Guidelines for \nProcurement. The terms of reference of the consultants are in Appendix 4.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis for \nFacilitating Cross-Border Trade and Investment in the Greater Mekong Subregion, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board.  \n ", "6 Appendix 1 \nGREATER MEKONG SUBREGION BUSINESS FORUM \nCORPORATE STRATEGY AND BUSINESS PLAN \nA.  Rationale \n1.  The Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Business Forum was established, in principle, \nwith the approval of terms of reference (TOR) in April 1997 by the Seventh GMS Ministerial \nConference within the framework of the GMS Economic Cooperation Program. The TOR define \nthe role of the GMS Business Forum, including its reporting requirements to the GMS Ministerial \nConference. The GMS Business Forum was formally established in October 2000 with financial \nand technical assistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the United Nations \nEconomic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP). Following the Ninth \nGMS Ministerial Conference and the Inception Meeting of the GMS Business Forum in October \n2000, the TOR have been expanded to increase the emphasis on the GMS Business Forum\u2019s \nrole in strengthening the capacity of the GMS\u2019s private sector in the context of supporting \nsubregional development. \n \n2.  The GMS Business Forum is an organization that brings its members together in a \nsubregional network to facilitate implementation of the GMS Economic Cooperation Program \nand to support subregional development through more extensive and effective involvement of \nthe private sector in subregional initiatives. It relies on a network of business associations and \nexternal funding agency partners to carry out its activities. \n \nB.  Organizational Overview \n \n3.  The GMS Business Forum consists of the six chambers of commerce and industry \n(CCIs) of Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Thailand, Viet Nam, and \nYunnan  province  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China.  These  CCIs  constitute  the  board  of \ndirectors.  The  board  chairmanship  is  rotated  among  the  CCIs,  the  six  core  members. \nMembership in the GMS Business Forum is open to international and multinational corporations \nand large, medium, and small business enterprises. The forum is financially supported by \nmembership fees and technical and financial assistance by external funding agencies and \ninternational business organizations. \n \n4.  A GMS Business Forum Secretariat is responsible for providing administrative, logistical, \nand coordinating supports. The secretariat is led by a Managing Director, and staffed by the \nConference Organizing Specialist, the Business Development Specialist and Administrative staff \nmember.   \n \n5.  As mandated by its TOR, the GMS Business Forum needs to report on a regular basis to \nthe  GMS  Ministerial  Conference  and  maintain  ongoing  linkages  with  relevant  forums  and \nworking groups of the GMS Economic Cooperation Program.  \n \nC.   Corporate Strategy \n \n6.  A first corporate strategy and business plan for the GMS Business Forum was jointly \ndeveloped by UNESCAP, ADB, and the GMS Business Forum Secretariat and adopted at the \nforum\u2019s Third Annual Meeting in December 2002.1 This strategy was further refined on 30 April \n                                                 \n1 GMS Business Forum. 2002.  Corporate Strategy/Business Plan for the Greater Mekong Subregion Business \nForum. Vientiane. ", "  Appendix 1  7\n2004. The role of the GMS Business Forum is defined as providing private sector-related \nproducts and services to facilitate the implementation of the GMS Economic Cooperation \nProgram  and  related  initiatives,  and  more  generally,  to  support  subregional  development \nthrough the activities and resources of the private sector. The forum\u2019s products and services are \naimed at both domestic and foreign private sectors; GMS governments; and external funding \nagencies supporting subregional cooperation, such as ADB and UNESCAP.  \n \n7.  The forum has a dual strategic focus and scope, consistent with the role defined in the \nTOR and approved by GMS ministers, as follows: \n \n(i)  To contribute in tangible ways to effective implementation of the GMS Economic \nCooperation Program by involving the private sector in selected subregional \ninitiatives  and  by  mobilizing  the  private  sector  to  undertake  complementary \ninvestment in subregional projects.  \n(ii)  To  facilitate  activities  broadly  supportive  of  the  private  sector\u2019s  role  in  the \nsubregion\u2019s development. This is a longer-term aim that builds on the GMS \nBusiness Forum\u2019s role in the GMS Economic Cooperation Program. \n \n8.  Increasingly there is a growing international consensus that corporate governance  \u2013 \ninvolving  but  not  limited  to  decision-making  transparency,  consistency,  documentation, \naccountability and review  \u2013 is central to organizational sustainability and renewal.  The GMS \nBusiness Forum undertook the development of a corporate governance framework in order to \nsupport facilitate the transparency and review of decision-making of the Board of Directors as \nwell as the monitoring of service development by the Secretariat. The Corporate Governance \nFramework defined the role and responsibility of the Board of Directors, and the reporting \nstructure  between  the  Secretariat  and  the  Board  of  Directors.  The  corporate  governance \nframework was approved by all core members, the six regional chambers of commerce and \nindustry, as  well  as  UNESCAP  and  ADB,  on  30  April  2004.  The  corporate  governance \nhandbook was reviewed and approved by core members during the 5th Annual Meeting of the \nGMS-BF in Sihanoukville, Cambodia. The corporate governance handbook was published in \nDecember 2004. \n \n9.  The forum\u2019s activities are guided by the following principles: (i) achieve GMS Economic \nCooperation Program development consensus and build intra- and inter-regional partnerships, \n(ii)  add  value  to  national  CCI  programs,  strengthen  ties  with  national  CCIs and thereby \ncomplement existing institutional services, (iii) provide a subregional perspective and scope in \ncoordinating supporting activities, (iv) address gaps in trade and investment facilitation services, \n(v) offer services on a cost-recovery basis, (vi) build credibility with its client base, and (vii) \ndocument activities and decision-making.  These principles are linked to the medium-term \nobjective of self-sustainability. The provision of credible, valued services will translate to a \ngrowing private sector client base willing to pay for such services, which will support the \nmedium-term viability of the GMS Business Forum. \n \n10.  The administrative support activities provided by the Secretariat include: (i) carrying out \nadministrative functions and network management, including coordinating relationships among \nthe  core  members  and  between  the  GMS  Business  Forum  and  the  GMS  Economic \nCoordination Program; (ii) preparing and delivering services to clients, that is, undertaking \nbusiness development by designing and executing efficient and demand-driven services for \nclients; and (iii) mobilizing resources from new and traditional sources of external funding.  \n \n   \n ", "8 Appendix 2 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign Summary  Performance Indicators  Monitoring Mechanisms  Assumptions/Risks \nand Targets \nGoal       \n     \nTo facilitate increased  \u00a7 More FDI.
