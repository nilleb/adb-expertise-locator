The United Nations (UN) System of National Accounts (SNA) constitutes the most widely \nused framework for the comprehensive presentation of macroeconomic statistical data. It was \ndesigned for economic analysis, policymaking, decision making, and evaluating countries\u2019 level \nof  development.  The  SNA  adopts  internationally  accepted  concepts,  definitions,  and \nclassifications,  and  it  allows  for  cross-country  comparisons.  In  February  1993,  the  United \nNations Statistical Commission (UNSC) adopted the 1993 SNA, the third version of the SNA, \nfollowing the second in 1968. The 1993 SNA accommodates the evolution of economies since \nthe 1968 SNA and takes into account advances in methodological research and the expanded \nneeds of users.  \n \n2.  Fifteen years since the introduction of the 1993 SNA, developing member countries \n(DMCs) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) are still a long way from implementing it. \nAvailable  statistics  indicate  the  DMCs  lag  behind  not  only  developed  countries  but  also \ncountries in transition. This technical assistance is part of a continuous effort on the part of ADB \nto further facilitate the implementation of the 1993 SNA. This is imperative if DMCs are to catch \nup and position themselves to deal with the additional issues arising from the ongoing revision \nof the 1993 SNA (1993 SNA revision 1), which is expected to be implemented in 2009. While \npast technical assistance on national accounts has largely been for individual countries, the \nproposed technical assistance is regional. The recently concluded regional technical assistance \n(RETA) 6088, Strengthening and Collection of Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) Data in Selected \nDeveloping Member Countries, included 21 developing member economies and showcased the \nsuccess that projects implemented as regional initiatives can enjoy. The proposed RETA is \nrecommended to be implemented along similar lines, to bring together participating countries \ninto satisfactory conceptual compliance and expand the scope of implementation of the 1993 \nSNA. Data inadequacy is reportedly the main impediment to implementing the 1993 SNA. \nSupply and use tables (SUTs) provide the most appropriate and comprehensive way to identify \ndata gaps, assess data quality, and in the process assist in strengthening the data systems of \nDMCs. While the regular conduct of statistical activities such as establishment surveys is still \nthe best way to meet the data needs for national account compilation, these activities require \nextensive resources. They are often low priorities for governments of DMCs, whose primary \nconcerns  are  understandably  the  provision  of  basic  social  services  such  as  health  and \neducation. Hence, alternative data sources will be investigated and explored such as, but not \nlimited to, administrative data. The RETA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The  UNSC  monitors  1993  SNA  implementation  in  accordance  with  an  assessment \nframework using compliance with 1993 SNA concepts and scope of accounts. Conceptual \ncompliance covers the inclusion of items affecting levels of gross domestic product (GDP) and \ngross national income. Recent information from the UNSC on these indicators is summarized in \nthe following tables. Table 1 shows the conceptual implementation of the 1993 SNA. Out of 38 \ncountries  in  Asia,  only  17,  or  45%,  have  achieved  conceptual  compliance.  The  recent \nexperience of ADB in the 2005 International Comparison Program for Asia and the Pacific (ICP \nAsia  Pacific)  further  highlighted  the  need  to  assist  countries  in  their  efforts  to  meet  the \nrequirements of the 1993 SNA. Of the 21 participating DMCs in ICP Asia Pacific, only four, or \n19%, reported full 1993 SNA implementation, while the others were at various stages and/or \nlevels of adoption.  \n \n \n                                                 \n1 The technical assistance first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 10 July 2008. \n ", "2   \nTable 1: Conceptual Implementation of 1993  SNA \n \n  No. of countries which  % of countries which \nFiscal Years 2002 - 2005   No. of  have achieved  have achieved \n(Assessment 2006)  countries  conceptual compliance  conceptual compliance \nwith 1993 SNA  with 1993 SNA \nUN Member Countries    192     101    53  \n  Developeda     28    26    93  \n  Transition Economies     28    28    100  \n  Developing     136    47    35  \n    Africa   53    9    17  \n    Caribbean and Latin America    33    19    58  \n    Western Asia   15    7    47  \n    Eastern, Southeastern, Southern Asia   23    10    43  \n    Oceania   12    2    17  \n      ESCAP Member Statesb     49     25     51   \nESCAP = Economic and Social Commission for Asian and the Pacific, No. = number, SNA = System of National Accounts, UN = United \nNations. \na Includes Western Europe, Northern America, Australia, Japan, and New Zealand. \nb Includes all member states of ESCAP, excluding France, the Netherlands, United Kingdom, and United States. \nSource: Information provided by the United Nations Statistics Division, August 2006. \n \n4.  The scope of implementation is measured by what is termed the \"minimum requirement \ndataset,\" which comprises seven tables recommended by the UN Statistical Division (UNSD) \nand indicates progress toward adopting the 1993 SNA. It is a prerequisite that countries compile \nthe minimum set of tables before the 1993 SNA is considered to have been implemented. \nBased on this criterion, only 50% of countries in Asia have compiled six or more tables, and \n18%  more  than  seven  tables.  These  compliance  rates  are  substantially  lower  than  in  the \ndeveloped and transition economies, which stand at 73% for six or more tables and 57% for \nseven or more tables. \n \nTable 2: Scope of Accounts (Minimum Requirement) \n \nFiscal Years 2002 - 2005  Number of  Six or More  %   Seven   % \n(Assessment 2006)  Countries  Tables    Tables   \n(1)  (2)  (3)  (4) = (3)/(2)  (5)  (6) = (5)/(2) \nUN Member Countries   192    94    49    58    30   \n  Developed a    28    24    86    15    54   \n  Transition Economies    28    17    61    17    61   \n  Developing    136    53    39    26    19   \n    Africa  53    12    23    7    13   \n    Caribbean and Latin America  33    20    61    11    33   \n    Western Asia  15    8    53    2    13   \n    Eastern, Southern, Southern Asia  23    11    48    5    22   \n    Oceania  12    2    17    1    8   \n      ESCAP Member Statesb    49     20     41     13     27    \nESCAP = Economic and Social Commission for Asian and the Pacific, UN = United Nations. \na Includes Western Europe, Northern America, Australia, Japan, and New Zealand. \nb Includes all member states of ESCAP, excluding France, the Netherlands, United King, and United States. \nSource: Information provided by the United Nations Statistics Division, August 2006. \n \n5.  A UNSD survey of 1993 SNA non-implementers showed that data inadequacy is the \nmain impediment to compiling national accounts, followed by, in order of importance, the lack of \nknowledge,  inadequate  number,  and  turnover,  of  staff.  While  numerous  initiatives  by \ninternational agencies have aimed to remedy these shortcomings, they have been undertaken \nmainly by area of expertise or mandate, such as agriculture, industry, services, prices, labor, \nhousehold income and expenditure statistics, and international trade. These initiatives have had \nthe desired outcome because they have been partial responses encompassing only a subset of \nbasic economic statistics. \n ", "3 \n   \n6.   UNSC has seen it necessary to update the 1993 SNA to maintain the relevance of the \nsystem in a rapidly changing world. Globalization, developments and innovations in financial \nmarkets,  and  the  growing  importance  of  non-financial  assets  (such  as  research  and \ndevelopment and databases) were among the motivations for the update. UNSC commissioned \nthe project to update the 1993 SNA in March 2003 and, in February 2008, formally adopted the \n1993 SNA revision 1 as the new international standard for compiling national accounts and as \nthe unifying framework for the integration of economic and related statistics. While the update \ndoes not recommend fundamental changes to the 1993 SNA, a list of 44 issues has been \nrecommended for inclusion. It is expected that the 1993 SNA revision 1 will be finalized in 2009. \nLest  DMCs  become  laggards  a  second  time  around,  assisting  them  to  enhance  their \nimplementation of the 1993 SNA warrants consideration. \n  \n7.  ADB is actively involved in monitoring poverty incidence and severity in the region and \naccessing  performance  against  the  first  Millennium  Development  Goal  (MDG)  of  halving \nabsolute poverty by 2015. The last 2 decades have seen measures of poverty that use $1 per \nday or $2 per day as a guiding principle increasingly adopted by international organizations and \npolicymakers. The use of $1 per day and $2 per day international poverty lines was initiated by \nthe World Bank for compiling national, regional and global poverty estimates. The current \npractice is to convert the international poverty line into local currency using purchasing power \nparity  (PPP)  for  the  consumption  aggregate  of  the  national  accounts.  If  the  consumption \naggregate is flawed, this carries into PPP computation, causing under- or overestimation of PPP \nand levels of poverty. It is extremely desirable that national account estimates be sufficiently \nreliable to assist in sound decision making.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.   Impact and Outcome \n8.  At the onset, the RETA is expected to increase the implementation of international \nstandards in macroeconomic statistics, with particular focus on national accounts, by improving \ncompliance with the 1993 SNA. This will allow more reliable GDP estimates for informed policy \nand decision making. The RETA seeks to help participating DMCs adopt the SUT framework \ntoward implementing the 1993 SNA, with particular focus on achieving minimum compliance \nand scope requirements. Specifically, the RETA is intended to (i) establish the supply and use \nframework for data gap assessment and GDP estimation based on the 1993 SNA, (ii) identify \nappropriate administrative data sources in addition to survey data for the construction of a SUT, \n(iii) develop a framework to derive sufficiently detailed expenditure weights such as those \nrequired for PPP compilation, (iv) increase the compliance of participating DMCs with 1993 SNA \nrecommendations, and (v) improve technical expertise and expose national accountants in the \nDMCs to alternative approaches for compiling consistent GDP aggregates based on the 1993 \nSNA. The delivery of these outputs will ensure that participating DMCs acquire more reliable \nand  accurate  data  for  both  monitoring  the  achievement  of  MDGs  related  to  poverty  and \nmeasuring economic output. Upon the successful completion of the RETA, selected DMCs will \nbe in a better position to take on the additional challenges of the 1993 SNA revision 1.  \n \nB.   Methodology and Key Activities \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \n9m. emberTso, B  aoacrhdi eovf eD irtehcet ordse, sMiraenda goeumtceontm, oer,  sttahfef,  aRnEd TmAa yw biell  pirdeelimntiinfya ryc oinu nnatrtuierse .  for  participation, \nc onstruct the supply use framework to identify data gaps, identify data sources and undertake of \ndata collection, and build capacity in statistics and knowledge management. \n   ", "4   \n10.  The identification of DMCs to participate in the RETA will be based on the reports of \ncountries that participated in the 2005 ICP Asia Pacific2. Bearing in mind the detailed data \nrequirements  for  implementing  the  RETA,  it  is  recommended  that  participating  DMCs  be \ngrouped  by  level  of  compliance  and  scope  of  implementation  of  the  1993  SNA,  which  is \nbasically measured in terms of satisfying the minimum requirement datasets. Assessment of \ncountries based on these two criteria will help determine data availability and the level of \nstatistical capacity. Initial institutional capacity assessment is proposed, to be conducted by the \nADB Economics and Research Department\u2019s Development Indicators and Policy Research \nDivision,  in  consultation  with  the  countries.  An  invitation  letter  to  determine  interest  in \nparticipating in the RETA will be sent to DMCs.  \n \n11.  The construction of the supply and use framework will involve the review of concepts \nand methodologies related to the 1993 SNA compilation, as well as industrial, establishment, \nand household expenditure surveys; investment surveys; and foreign trade statistics, among \nother things. Economies\u2019 sources of products (domestic production plus imports) will then be \nidentified and classified in the supply table. Likewise, the uses of the products (intermediate \nconsumption, final consumption, and export) and other primary factors, as well as the derivation \nof  gross  value  added  (the  difference  between  gross  output  and  intermediate \nconsumption/intermediate inputs of goods and services in production) will then be developed to \nmake up the use tables. The two tables will then be linked to form a matrix table such that the \ntotal supply of a product will always be equal to the total use of that product. \n \n12.  Data availability is significant for 1993 SNA implementation. As mentioned above, the \nUNSD survey to investigate underlying factors that impede the implementation of 1993 SNA \nshows that data availability, both in scope and frequency, is the main obstacle. The survey \nindicated that most developing countries currently adopt a recommended data collection cycle \nof economic censuses as benchmarks, followed by annual and more frequent surveys. In \ncontrast,  most  developed  countries  (75%)  and  transition  economies  (93%)  have  adopted \nalternative approaches that rely on annual and more frequent surveys in combination with \nadministrative data. This latter approach will be recommended to participating DMCs, as it \nmaximizes the use of administrative sources, minimizes the response burden, and cuts costs, \nwhile providing information of near-census quality.  \n \n13.  Training course(s) and/or workshops for national statistical offices (NSOs) and relevant \nagencies will be conducted on the compilation of national accounts, with particular focus on the \nminimum requirement datasets. These will include assessing the reasons for low compliance, \nidentifying  data  gaps  and  possible  solutions  to  address  data  gap  issues  and  improve \ncompliance. A model similar to the 2005 ICP experience will be used to ensure output delivery: \nan initial workshop to identify data gaps and possible data sources, with follow-up workshops \nwhere problems and solutions are discussed. The DMCs will then adopt the proposed solutions \nand report at a final workshop. Technical assistance shall be provided as needed, depending on \nindividual country requirements. \n \n14.  At the Development Indicators and Policy Research Division, staff will have acquired \ntechnical know-how in SUT construction and understanding of the requirements of the 1993 \nSNA and its updates in SNA revision 1. This will be very useful in data analysis and the \npreparation of the key indicators. \n \n                                                 \n2 Economies that participated in the 2005 ICP Asia Pacific include: Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brunei Darussalam,  Cambodia, People\u2019s Republic \nof China, Hong Kong, Fiji, India, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Maldives, Mongolia,  Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka, \nTaipei, Thailand, Viet Nam  \n ", "5 \n15.  Upon the successful completion of the RETA, participating DMCs will have satisfied \nminimum  requirements  for  1993  SNA  compliance  and  acquired  the  know-how  to  analyze \nrevisions in GDP levels resulting from 1993 SNA compliance and estimate reliable expenditure \nweights for future PPP calculations. A concluding regional workshop will be conducted to share \nthe lessons of the project \n \n16.  Towards the end of the RETA, a publication of the SUTs and the minimum requirement \ndatasets for the participating DMCs will be produced. The publication will include data sources \nand collection strategies, data assessment reports and other relevant reports. The publication \nwill be circulated among NSOs and other relevant agencies in the region. To disseminate the \nimportant output of this RETA, it is proposed that the resulting tables be published on the ADB \nwebsite under the economic and statistics webpage, as well as on the websites of participating \nNSOs. A concluding workshop will be held before RETA completion, at which participating \nDMCs will present their results and their future courses of action to ensure the sustainability of \nSUT compilation; address the low compliance rate and data gaps, should any still exist; and \ntake on the challenges that will arise from the revisions of the 1993 SNA.  \n \nC.   Cost and Financing \n17.  The total cost of the RETA is estimated to be $800,000. It will be financed as a grant by \nADB\u2019s  technical  assistance  funding  program  and  cover  consulting  services;  training  and \nworkshops;  data  collection,  assessment,  and  analysis;  equipment;  and  administrative  and \nsupport costs. The detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for the RETA, with national statistical offices or \nagencies in charge of the compilation of national accounts as Implementing Agencies. The \nadministration  of  the RETA  will  be  handled  by  the  Economics  and  Research  Department. \nConfirmation of no-objection will be obtained from the government of each participating DMC \nprior  to  starting  RETA  activities  in  each  such  DMC,  in  coordination  with  their  regional \ndepartments3.   \n \n19.  The RETA will be implemented from September 2008 to December 2010 and finance 30 \nperson-months of consulting services: 5 international and 25 national. The consultants will be \nselected and engaged individually by ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The terms of reference of the consultants \nare in Appendix 3.   \n \n20.  ADB will procure computer hardware and software in accordance with its Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time), and this equipment will be disposed of in \naccordance with instructions on administering grant-financed technical assistance.4 \n \nIV.
