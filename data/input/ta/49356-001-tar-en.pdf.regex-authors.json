INTRODUCTION \n1.  The National Energy Policy and Energy Action Plan of the Republic of the Marshall \nIslands (RMI) established a renewable energy generation target of 20% for electric power by \n2020.1 While targets in the energy action plan are not legally binding, the energy action plan \nidentified the need for numerous resource assessments and feasibility studies, including on the \nexpansion of renewable energy (solar). Some of these assessments and feasibility studies have \nbeen completed and have contributed to the design of the proposed capacity development \ntechnical assistance (TA). \n \n2.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  received  a  request  from  Marshalls  Energy \nCompany (MEC) in July 2015 to assist with identifying investment needs in Majuro\u2019s power \nsystem to allow for an expansion of intermittent renewable power generation. The country \noperations business plan, 2017\u20132019 for the Marshall Islands includes the proposed TA, and \nsupports the government\u2019s policy objectives for renewable energy (Appendix 1).2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Peak demand on Majuro (the RMI\u2019s most populous and economically active atoll with \nover  50%  of  its  population)  is  approximately  7.5  megawatts,  and  is  supplied  by  diesel \ngeneration with a combined maximum capacity of 11.7 megawatts located at a central power \nstation  supplying  three  feeders  at  13.8  kilovolts.  A  209-kilowatt-peak  grid-connected  solar \nphotovoltaic  system  is  installed  at  the  Majuro  Hospital,  along  with  a  51-kilowatt-peak \nphotovoltaic system at the College of the Marshall Islands. A 600-kilowatt-peak photovoltaic \ninvestment was completed in May 2016 at Majuro\u2019s airport (financed by a grant from the Abu \nDhabi Fund for Development). \n \n4.  Majuro\u2019s distribution network is over 30 years old, is in need of significant reinvestment \nand modernization, and\u2014crucially\u2014was not designed to accommodate significant distributed \ngeneration from intermittent renewable resources (i.e., solar or wind). MEC\u2019s fleet of diesel \ngenerators and control system was designed to serve this network and is similarly incapable of \naccommodating high levels of intermittent renewable energy penetration. \n \n5.  Analysis conducted by the Japan International Cooperation Agency under its hybrid \nislands program reveals that the current system can accommodate no more than approximately \n890 kilowatts of photovoltaics without investments in the Majuro power plant and in Majuro\u2019s \ndistribution network.3 This represents less than 8% renewable energy penetration\u2014far short of \nthe national energy policy\u2019s 20% target. With the completion of the photovoltaic investment in \nMajuro\u2019s airport, Majuro\u2019s system has reached its maximum technically feasible grid-connected \nphotovoltaic generation capacity. \n \n   \n                                                \n1 Government of the Marshall Islands. 2009.

Impacts and Outcome \n6.  The  impacts  will  be  an  increased  share  of  renewable  power  generation,  improved \nservice reliability, reduced reliance on imported fossil fuels, and a reduction in the cost of \nelectricity generation for the RMI. The outcome will be the adoption by MEC of an investment \nplan to support renewable energy in Majuro. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n7.  This  TA  will  build  on  the  previous  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency-funded \nanalysis  of  MEC\u2019s  renewable  energy  potential  and  existing  generation  and  network \ninfrastructure  to  prepare  investments  that  will  enable  MEC  to  increase  renewable  energy \npenetration on Majuro to at least 20%, with concomitant improvements in network efficiency \n(e.g.,  reduction  in  distribution  losses,  reactive  power  requirements).  In  preparation  for  the \nproposed investments, the skills and capacity of staff from MEC as well as from government \nenergy planning offices will also be enhanced through their involvement throughout the process \nand structured training workshops (thus contributing to sustainability of the outcome). \n \n8.  The TA will assist MEC in developing an investment program to increase its network\u2019s \nabsorption capacity to accept more renewable generation, in line with the RMI National Energy \nPolicy and Energy Action Plan targets (footnote 1). This will allow MEC to increase its share of \nelectricity generated from renewable resources and, commensurately, reduce its consumption \nof diesel fuel for power generation to provide increased access to clean, reliable, and affordable \npower without negatively affecting grid stability. The current lack of such an actionable plan \nresults  in  investment  resources  from  individual  internal  and  external  sources  (e.g.,  from \ndevelopment partners) being (i) programmed on an ad hoc and opportunistic basis without \nconsideration  for  concurrent  or  planned  activities  from  a  different  source,  or  (ii)  foregone \nbecause of the absence of an established investment framework. The intended outcome will \nallow MEC to devote capital resources to increasing its network\u2019s capacity to accept more \nrenewable energy generation and deliver improved service to the RMI economy. \n \n9.  The TA will (i) prepare a thorough inventory and condition assessment of the Majuro \npower  system,  (ii)  model  the  existing  system\u2019s  capacity  to  absorb  additional  intermittent \ngeneration (primarily solar), (iii) prepare an optimization analysis to identify incremental and \nappropriately  sequenced  capital  investments  to  allow  increased  renewable  generation  and \nreduce network losses, and (iv) produce technical, economic, and financial feasibility studies for \nidentified prioritized investments. The optimization analysis will take into account renewable \nresource availability and technology costs to assess the economic and technical feasibility of \ninvestment options. Based on the optimization analysis, the consultants engaged under the TA \nwill prepare a sequenced investment plan for the Majuro system. Consultants will engage \ndirectly with MEC staff and the Ministry of Resources and Development\u2019s energy planning \ndepartment to build their capacity to perform such analysis in the future, including by providing \ntraining on the use of selected modeling software and methods. \n \n10.  The TA will review  MEC\u2019s financial management and accounting practices and will \nrecommend  improvements  in  (i)  its  accounting  practices,  (ii)  the  identification  of  its  cost \nstructures and revenue requirements, and (iii) its corresponding revisions to its tariff structures. \nThe TA will also analyze the macroeconomic impact of (i) the RMI\u2019s exposure to global oil price \n ", "  3 \nvolatility, (ii) MEC\u2019s distortionary embedded cross-subsidies and transfer pricing among MEC\u2019s \nareas of operation (e.g. between fuel delivery services and electricity), and (iii) the drain on \npublic resources from MEC\u2019s recurrent subsidy requirements. \n \n11.  It is assumed that (i) MEC and Ministry of Resources and Development personnel will \nmake all necessary data available to consultants to perform their assigned tasks, and (ii) these \npersonnel  will  be  available  and  able  to  collaborate  with  consultants  for  capacity-building \npurposes. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $700,000, of which $690,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Clean Energy Fund4 under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility and \nadministered by ADB.  \n \n13.  The  government,  through  MEC,  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of \ncounterpart  staff,  facilities  hosting  for  consultations  and  meetings,  information  access, \nsecretarial assistance for arranging site visits, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  ADB will implement this TA. MEC will serve as the direct working counterpart and \nprimary beneficiary of the TA and will support consultants by providing access to necessary \ninformation and facilities, and as described in para. 13. \n  \n15.  ADB will engage a consulting firm for this TA. The TA will require 22 person-months of \ninternational consultant inputs over approximately 11 months. ADB will engage consultants in \naccordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). \nDisbursements will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n16.  Outputs  will  be  delivered  in  the  form  of  reports  prepared  by  the  consultants  and \ndelivered to the Government of the RMI, MEC, and ADB. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION  \n \n17.   The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $690,000 to the Republic of \nthe Marshall Islands to be financed on a grant basis by the Clean Energy Fund under the Clean \nEnergy Financing Partnership Facility for Majuro Power Network Strengthening, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                \n4 Financing partners: the governments of Australia, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. \n ", "4  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nImpacts the TA is Aligned with \nAn increased share of renewable power generation, improved service reliability, reduced reliance on \nimported fossil fuels, and a reduction in cost of electricity generation (National Energy Policy and Energy \nAction Plan)a  \n  Performance Indicators  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  with Targets and Baselines  Reporting  Risks \nOutcome  By December 2017     \n   \na.
