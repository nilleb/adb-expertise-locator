THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Kingdom of Tonga for the Cyclone Gita Recovery Project. \n \n2.  The project will support the efforts of the Government of Tonga to reconstruct and climate- \nand disaster-proof the Nuku\u2019alofa electricity network that was damaged by Tropical Cyclone Gita \nin February 2018. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The Kingdom of Tonga consists of 172 islands, 36 of which are inhabited. The total \npopulation is about 107,000 people, of which almost two-thirds live on the main island of \nTongatapu, home to the country\u2019s capital of Nuku\u2019alofa. Based on its exposure, susceptibility, and \ncoping and adaptive capacities, Tonga has been ranked second only to Vanuatu among the \ncountries in the world most at risk of disasters caused by natural hazards.1 In any given year, it is \nlikely that Tonga is either hit by a major natural disaster or is recovering from a previous one.  \n \n4.  The country is already experiencing the effects of climate change. Increasing variability in \nrainfall patterns is causing flooding and droughts in some locations. Increasing ocean temperature \nhas led to coral bleaching and destruction of natural coastal barriers, and sea level rise is \ncontributing to coastal erosion.2 These changes have heightened Tonga\u2019s exposure to disasters \nbrought about by tropical cyclones and storm surges, which have inflicted significant losses on \nthe economy. For example, a cyclone in 2002 resulted in losses of $60 million,3 and losses from \nanother one in 2010 reached $22 million.4 Tropical Cyclone Ian in 2014 resulted in total damage \nand losses of about $50 million.5 Tonga is also located within the Pacific \u201cring of fire,\u201d which is \nassociated with extreme seismic activity.  \n \n5.  Tonga is expected to incur, on average, $15.5 million per year in losses from earthquakes \nand tropical cyclones. In the next 50 years, Tonga has a 50% chance of experiencing a loss \nexceeding $175 million and casualties higher than 440 people, and a 10% chance of experiencing \na loss exceeding $430 million and casualties higher than 1,700 people.6  These figures could \nincrease if the impacts of climate change are considered.  \n \n6.  The emergency. Tropical Cyclone Gita hit Tonga on 12 and 13 February 2018. It caused \nwidespread destruction on Tongatapu, including Nuku\u2019alofa, and the neighboring island of \u2018Eua. \nWith average wind speeds of 130 kilometers per hour, and gusts of up to 195 kilometers per hour, \nit was the strongest cyclone to directly hit Tongatapu and \u2018Eua since severe Cyclone Isaac in \nMarch 1982. An accompanying storm surge reached 1 meter above normal high-tide levels, and \n200 millimeters of rain fell within 24 hours, resulting in localized flooding. It is estimated that more \nthan 80,000 people (or about 80% of the population of Tonga) were directly affected. The \ndestructive winds, storm surges, and flooding brought down power lines; damaged and destroyed \n                                                \n1  Alliance Development Works. 2017.

", "2 \nschools, resulting in closures; destroyed crops and fruit trees; and damaged public buildings, \nincluding the domestic airport, the Parliament building, and Tonga meteorological services. Nearly \n5,000 houses were either destroyed or damaged. The government declared a state of emergency \nfor the whole of Tonga on 12 February 2018. \n \n7.  Energy  sector  damage  and  needs.  The  government  led  a  post-disaster  rapid \nassessment  (PDRA)  with  assistance  from  development  partners,  including  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB).7 The PDRA estimated the total value of effects caused by the cyclone \nto be about $164.3 million, equivalent to nearly 38% of the nominal 2017 gross domestic product \nin Tonga. The estimation of recovery needs incorporated the principle of \u201cbuilding back better.\u201d \nThe total recovery and reconstruction cost is estimated at $148.7 million, of which $45.9 million \nis for the energy sector, including the cost of reconstruction of the power grid infrastructure assets \non Tongatapu to a higher standard of disaster resilience.  \n \n8.  Grid  upgrades  improve  disaster  resilience  of  electricity  network.  The  cyclone \ndisrupted the power supply on the islands of \u2018Eua and Tongatapu, disconnecting all Tonga Power \nLimited (TPL) customers. However, the service lines that had already been upgraded under the \nongoing Outer Islands Renewable Energy Project (OIREP)8 in \u2018Eua, and under the Tonga Village \nNetwork Upgrade Project (TVNUP) in Tongatapu funded by the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign \nAffairs and Trade (MFAT), experienced significantly less damage than the grids that had not yet \nbeen upgraded. On Tongatapu, TVNUP had already upgraded 54% of TPL\u2019s grid prior to the \nlandfall of the cyclone. Of the grids that had not yet been upgraded, 45.9% were damaged, \ncompared with a damage of only 4.7% to the upgraded grids. The experience from OIREP and \nthe TVNUP clearly demonstrates the resilience benefits of updating inefficient and aging power \nnetwork infrastructure and building back better. \n \n9.  Over  the  first  6  weeks,  during  which  businesses  and  schools  were  closed,  TPL \nreconnected the 17,782 customers in Tongatapu through temporary emergency repairs, awaiting \nthe final reconstruction and disaster-proofing. However, in the current condition, the network \nwould not be able to withstand another storm. The old service lines are now connected with \nseveral joints, making them more susceptible to faults.9 The final reconstruction and upgrade \nshould be done as soon as possible, to minimize secondary impacts on the economy and to \nrestore reliable power supply in priority areas and for essential services.10 \n \n10.  Status of donor coordination. The Government of Tonga is leading the response efforts \nwith  the  assistance  of  nine  humanitarian  clusters  and  support  from  bilateral  partners, \nnongovernment organizations, and other development partners. The government implemented a \nrange of social protection programs to support households, including provision of additional funds \nto the elderly and people with disabilities. In the immediate aftermath of the cyclone, donor \ncontributions and insurance payouts to the government\u2019s emergency fund were used to finance \nmany  of  the  most  urgent  recovery  needs,  and  several  government  ministries  reallocated \nresources to cyclone recovery activities.11 \n                                                \n7  Government of Tonga.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Grant to the Kingdom \nof Tonga for the Outer Island Renewable Energy Project. Manila.  \n9  During the first full month of operations with temporary connections (April 2018), the network was experiencing more \nthan double the average number of faults in 2017. TPL predicts that power outages will increase as the temporary \nconnections deteriorate and fail. \n10 The project area also includes essential services such as the main hospital and the main water supply bore field. \n11 The government\u2019s emergency fund receives annual appropriations for natural hazards and other emergencies. The \nfund played an important role in the government\u2019s immediate response and early recovery efforts, and disaster \ncontingent financing and catastrophe risk insurance payments were channeled through its structures. \n ", "3 \n11.  The  energy  sector  reconstruction  costs  are  estimated  at  $45.9  million,  and  after \ncontributions from the government\u2019s emergency fund (about $3.3 million) and New Zealand MFAT \n($2.1 million for immediate repairs, and $7.7 million for reconstruction), $34.5 million remains \nunmet. The World Bank and other development partners will focus on other sectors, such as \nhousing and education. \n \n12.  ADB response to Cyclone Gita. On 15 February 2018, the government requested to \nwithdraw $6.0 million in disaster contingent financing (a $3.1 million loan and $2.9 million grant) \nunder ADB\u2019s Pacific Disaster Resilience Program, which was established in December 2017 to \nhelp strengthen the disaster resilience of Samoa, Tonga, and Tuvalu.12 ADB released the \n$6 million budget support within 24 hours from the request. On 22 February, ADB provided an \nadditional $1 million under the Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund for humanitarian relief efforts. \nThese funds were deposited in the government\u2019s emergency fund and were an essential part of \nits immediate response and early recovery efforts.  \n \n13.  On 12 April 2018, the government requested further ADB support to access $8.8 million \nunder the Asian Development Fund 12 Disaster Response Facility for the (i) reconstruction and \nupgrade of electricity network infrastructure damaged by the cyclone ($6.8 million), noting ADB\u2019s \ncomparative advantage and ongoing projects in the sector that would allow rapid implementation \nof the project; and (ii) setup of a new disaster contingent financing facility ($2.0 million) to replace \nprevious disaster contingent financing under ADB\u2019s Pacific Disaster Resilience Program, which \nwas drawn down in full in response to Cyclone Gita.13 \n \n14.  Value added by ADB assistance. In response to the government\u2019s request, ADB\u2019s \nemergency assistance will finance the reconstruction and \u201cbuilding back better\u201d of priority areas \nof the Nuku\u2019alofa electricity network, identified as the most affected by the cyclone. The project \nwill restore access to reliable electricity supply, reduce losses, and upgrade the network to a \nhigher standard of disaster resilience.  \n \n15.  ADB  has  sufficient  presence  and  expertise  in  the  country  and  offers  comparative \nadvantage for energy sector infrastructure reconstruction. TPL is an implementing agency for two \nongoing ADB projects in Tonga: (i) OIREP, to install solar power generation and expand the \nelectricity network in Ha\u2019apai, \u2018Eua, and Va\u2019vau Islands (footnote 8); and (ii) Cyclone Ian Recovery \nProject, to rehabilitate and climate- and disaster-proof the electricity network on Ha\u2019apai Islands.14  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n12 ADB. 2017.

Manila. \n13 As provided in the Concessional Assistance Policy, in the event of a disaster, an Asian Development Fund-only \ncountry can access up to 100% of its annual performance-based allocation from the Disaster Response Facility. \nTonga\u2019s request of $8.8 million corresponds to 100% of the 2018 performance-based allocation for Tonga. A new \ndisaster contingent financing facility ($2 million) will be processed through regular procedures for policy-based \nlending, targeting approval in early 2019. \n14 ADB. 2014.

The project is aligned with the following impacts: more reliable and safe energy services; \nand more reliable and safe buildings and structures to improve services and maintenance, save \non energy usage, and increase resilience to disasters.15 The project will have the following \noutcome: reliable electricity supply in Nuku\u2019alofa priority areas restored.16 \n \nC.  Output \n \n17.  Priority sections of Nuku\u2019alofa electricity network rehabilitated and upgraded. The \nproject will restore reliable access to the electricity supply network and make it more resilient to \nextreme weather and disasters by repairing the utilities and upgrading them to a higher standard \nof disaster resilience. The \u201cbuilding back better\u201d activities will follow the overall plans for the \nupgrade of the Nuku\u2019alofa network, as described in the Nuku\u2019alofa Network Upgrade Project \n(NNUP) due diligence report.17 The proposed NNUP includes five contiguous subproject areas \nand 56 villages in Nuku'alofa. MFAT has committed NZ$11 million (about $7.74 million) for the \nNNUP under a separate project. MFAT and ADB funds will address the immediate priority areas \nunder the NNUP that were identified during the PDRA preparation as those most affected by \nCyclone Gita.18 \n \n18.  The project will rehabilitate the existing high-voltage and low-voltage overhead network \nusing disaster-resilience measures such as modern aerial-bundled conductors, and install new \n11/0.4-kilovolt  distribution  transformers  and  new  underground  service  cables  to  customer \npremises with new smart meters.19 The project will be viewed as part of a rolling program to \neventually reconstruct all of Nuku\u2019alofa, resulting in better access to reliable power supply, \nreduction in losses, and less damage during cyclones. \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n19.  The project is estimated to cost $9.42 million (Table 1). Detailed cost estimates by \nexpenditure category and by financier are in the project administration manual (PAM).20 The major \nexpenditure items include works and equipment.  \n \nTable 1: Summary Cost Estimates \n($ million) \nItem  Amounta \nA.

The government has requested a grant not exceeding $6.8 million from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources (Asian Development Fund) to help finance the project.  \n \n21.  The summary financing plan is in Table 2. ADB will finance the expenditures in relation to \nequipment, civil works, and labor, and the government will provide the equivalent of $1.14 million \nas in-kind contribution in the form of exemption on taxes, duties, and environment levy. TPL will \nprovide the equivalent of $1.48 million as in-kind contribution in the form of staff time for design, \nsupervision,  installation  of  works,  and  management  and  administration  of  the  project.

The Ministry of Finance and National Planning (MFNP) will be the executing agency, and \nTPL will be the implementing agency. The Project Coordination Committee for the NNUP will \nprovide oversight;21 it is co-chaired by the MFNP and the Ministry of Meteorology, Energy, \nInformation, Disaster Management, Environment, Climate Change and Communications; and \nincludes the Ministry of Public Enterprises, TPL, MFAT, and ADB as members.  \n \n24.  TPL will carry out the engineering design, bidding process, supervision, and installation \nwork. It will disburse the grant proceeds in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2017, as amended from time to time) and will follow ADB\u2019s financial management guidelines. \nProcurement will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and \nProcurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time).  \n \n25.  ADB will finance some of the incremental labor costs that TPL incurs in carrying out the \nproject civil works, using force account. It is expected that direct contracting of goods will be based \non the results of parallel competitive procurement actions conducted by TPL for the MFAT-funded \nproject under NNUP, provided that such results are consistent with ADB\u2019s Procurement Policy \nand  Procurement  Regulations.  ADB  will  undertake  due  diligence  on  such  MFAT-funded \nprocurement activities prior to authorizing the use of direct contracting to the selected suppliers. \n \n \n                                                \n21 Both ADB and New Zealand investments in energy sector reconstruction will be carried out under the NNUP \nstructure. \n ", "6 \n26.

The project supports critical post-Cyclone Gita reconstruction priorities, and Tonga\u2019s \nClimate Change Adaptation and Disaster Risk Management priorities. The investment activities \nhave been screened and found appropriate. Implementing the project activities will allow for \nlearning through monitoring and evaluation and for replication elsewhere in Tonga. The project is \ncoordinated with and supported by other development partners, and the approach will further \nimprove development coordination. The government\u2019s PDRA is the basis for selection of project \noutputs  (footnote  7).  Alternative  technical  configurations  were  considered.  The  proposed \nconfiguration is considered technically optimal under the local conditions to climate- and disaster \nproof the electricity network. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n28.  In accordance with ADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy (2004), economic \nand financial analysis may be finalized before project implementation.22 The economic and \nfinancial analysis carried out for the NNUP will be used as the basis to finalize the analysis for the \nproject. ADB will allocate sufficient resources to undertake the economic and financial due \ndiligence. \n \n29.  An economic analysis will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the \nEconomic Analysis of Projects.23 It will cover the macroeconomic and sector context and include \na discussion of rationale for public investment, demand analysis, alternatives and least-cost \nanalysis, cost\u2013benefit analysis, sustainability analysis, distribution analysis, and sensitivity and \nrisk analyses, and it will include a clear discussion of the without- and with-project scenarios.  \n \n30.  A financial analysis will be prepared in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Financial \nManagement and Analysis of Projects.24 Financial viability will be assessed by comparing the \nincremental costs and revenues over the life of the project. In the event of insufficient cost \nrecovery, an assessment of the financial sustainability will be conducted, to assess (i) the \ncoverage of incremental recurrent costs required to ensure sustainability of the project benefits, \nand (ii) the capacity of the executing and implementing agency to fund these costs. \n \nC.

A financial management assessment was conducted for the project in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Financial Management Guidelines and Financial Due Diligence: A Methodology Note.25  \nThe assessment considered the MFNP as the executing agency and TPL as the implementing \nagency.  The  MFNP  and  TPL  have  satisfactory  experience  with  implementing  ADB-funded \nprojects. \n \n \n                                                \n22  ADB. 2004.

The  overall  inherent  and  project  risk  is  considered  moderate,  given  that  a  project \nmanagement unit (PMU) will be set up and the new staff will be trained on ADB\u2019s disbursements, \nfinancial reporting, and auditing requirements. A key risk mitigating measure will be to ensure that \na dedicated full-time qualified project accountant forms part of the PMU in TPL.  \n \n33.  TPL has a functioning procurement unit and has successfully undertaken procurement of \nsimilar goods for other ADB-funded projects. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to \ndate) was explained to and discussed with the government, MFNP, and TPL. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 20). \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n34.  The reconstruction and \u201cbuilding back better\u201d of the immediate priority areas of Nuku\u2019alofa \nelectricity network will help provide a more reliable and disaster-resilient power supply in the \ncommunity. This greatly benefits the households that are dependent on reliable energy supply for \nthe continuation of their income-generating and productive activities. Women especially will be \nable to continue performing their multiple roles, including household care, more efficiently.  \n \n35.  The project is proposed as some gender elements. Gender activities and targets during \nproject implementation include (i) at least 30% women\u2019s participation and involvement in all \nproject consultations during implementation, to determine specific issues affecting women and to \npropose effective mitigating measures; (ii) the implementation of HIV/AIDS and gender-sensitivity \nawareness sessions to prevent sexual harassment and gender-based violence at work among all \nTPL ground staff and contractors; and (iii) at least 30% women\u2019s participation in training programs \nrelated to maintenance and operation. The women will be prioritized for work opportunities and \nkey positions. Particularly, the model of employing women as line workers will be replicated in the \nproject for additional TPL workers.26 The proposed PMU within TPL will be responsible for the \nproject\u2019s gender and social activities, with capacity-building support provided by the project.  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n36.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.27 TPL PMU will be responsible for safeguard compliance of the project \nduring implementation. \n \n37.  Environment (category B). An environmental assessment and review framework has \nbeen  prepared  with  the  environmental  safeguard  requirements  applicable  to  the  proposed \nproject.28 The  disaster-response  nature  of  this  project  entails  that  the  site-specific  initial \nenvironmental examination will be conducted at the early stage of project implementation and \nbefore the physical execution of the subprojects. Most of the project activities will be limited to \nupgrades of existing facilities, and the project is not expected to have any significant and \nirreversible  impacts.  The  adverse  impacts  are  likely  temporary  and  localized,  and  can  be \nmanaged with the proposed mitigation measures and the Code of Environmental Practice, which \nare included in the environmental assessment and review framework and the initial environment \nexaminations. \n \n                                                \n26 The Outer Island Renewable Energy Project (footnote 8) engaged a total of 12-line workers, of whom 10 are women, \nto expand the electricity network in Ha\u2019apai, Eua, and Va\u2019vau Islands. TPL worked with technical and vocational \ncolleges in targeting women applicants. This is a successful engagement model adopted by TPL. \n27  ADB.

Involuntary  resettlement  (category  C).  The  project  will  not  involve  involuntary \nresettlement or land acquisition. All reconstruction work will take place entirely within state-owned \nland. The power poles and lines are situated along dedicated road reserves. The underground \nservice  cables  will  be  confined  to  the  customers\u2019  premises.  The  installation  of  distribution \ntransformers will take place on existing, TPL-owned land.  \n \n39.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The project will not impact distinct and vulnerable \ngroups of indigenous peoples as defined under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The \nbeneficiaries in the project sites are part of mainstream Polynesian society.  \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n40.
