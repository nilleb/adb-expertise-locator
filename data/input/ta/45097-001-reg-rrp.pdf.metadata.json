I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nequity contribution in the ASEAN1 Infrastructure Fund (AIF) of $50,000,000 annually for 3 years, \ncommencing from 2011, and ADB\u2019s administration of the AIF. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n2.       ASEAN\u2019s infrastructure deficit. The estimated infrastructure needs in the Asia and \nPacific region are large, about $750 billion/year during 2010\u20132020. Out of this, the ASEAN \nregion accounts for over $60 billion per year.2 While the ASEAN region has grown rapidly since \nthe 1997/98 Asian financial crisis and withstood the impact of the recent global economic crisis, \nthis sustained growth has also created huge pressure on the infrastructure coverage of the \nASEAN region. Table 1 compares basic infrastructure data for ASEAN, Asia, and other regions.  \n \nTable 1: Global Comparison in Infrastructure Coverage (2008) \nItem  Roads (km)  Rail   Phones  Electrification  Clean Water \n(km)  (number) \n  Per 1,000 people  Percentage \nASEAN  10.51  0.27  3.53  71.69  86.39 \nAsia  12.83  0.53  3.47  77.71  87.72 \nOECD  211.68  5.21  13.87  99.80  99.63 \nLatin  America  14.32  2.48  6.11  92.70  91.37 \nAfrica  n.a.  0.95  1.42  28.50  58.36 \nASEAN = Association of Southeast Asian Nations, km = kilometer, OECD = Organisation for Economic \nCo-operation and Development.  \nSource: ADB, UNDP, and UNESCAP.2010. Paths to 2015: MDG Priorities in Asia and the Pacific. \n \n3.       ASEAN  members  have  been  concerned  about  the  critical  need  to  address  the \ninadequacies of its infrastructure based on a clear recognition that infrastructure development is \nessential  to the  realization  of  ASEAN\u2019s  goal  of  economic  integration and  indispensable  to \nestablish an ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) by 2015.  \n \n4.       As  a  response,  in  2010,  the  ASEAN  leaders  issued  their  Master  Plan  on  ASEAN \nConnectivity (MPAC). This reflected the vision of ASEAN leaders that building an AEC by 2015 \ncalled for a well-connected ASEAN that would be more competitive and resilient, as it would \nbring capital, peoples, goods, and services closer. As the priority projects of the MPAC will \nrequire a significant level of financing support, a large pool of financing sources is needed.  \n \n5.       ASEAN\u2019s paradox on infrastructure financing. The substantial resources needed to \nreduce the significant gaps in infrastructure as shown above, and to effectively implement the \nMPAC, cannot be met by the countries on their own. At the same time, both domestic and \ninternational project financiers are constrained by the market perception of the high degree of \nrisk involved in long-tenor infrastructure transactions. While multilateral institutions such as ADB \n                                                \n1  ASEAN has the following members: Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam.  \n2  ADB and ADB Institute. 2009. Infrastructure for a Seamless Asia. Manila. \n ", "2 \nor bilateral institutions may meet a part of the requirements, the resource requirements far \nexceed their lending capacity.  \n \n6.       More  importantly,  the  region  continues  to  face  a  paradox:  it  has  large  unfunded \ninfrastructure  requirements  despite  having  significant  regional  private  savings  and  foreign \nexchange reserves. The ASEAN region currently holds more than $700 billion in reserves.3 The \nsolution to the paradox lies in matching the resources with the needs by (i) designing funding \nmodalities and establishing their track record to translate regional savings into investments; and \n(ii) structuring viable infrastructure projects\u2013including those involving private sector participation \nand public\u2013private partnership (PPP) modality. \n \n7.       Innovative financing initiative.  The proposed AIF represents an innovative regional \ncooperation and integration initiative that seeks to address this paradox. Through this initiative, \nand with ADB\u2019s investment, technical and operational support, ASEAN\u2019s investments will be \ncatalyzed, representing an important effort at south-south cooperation.4 This initiative will start \nproviding effective infrastructure project lending at the country and subregional levels in ASEAN. \nThe AIF model thus holds the promise of leveraging future potential equity contributions and \ncofinancing, and subsequently demonstrating a means of unlocking a portion of the region\u2019s \nown resources (such as domestic savings and foreign reserves) for its needs through future \ndebt issuance.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n8.       The AIF\u2019s impact will be enhanced access to key infrastructure services within ASEAN. \nThe outcome will be greater connectivity within ASEAN, including pooling of resources through \nenhanced infrastructure, to support the goals of the AEC. Specifically, the AIF will promote \nsustainable  and  inclusive  economic  development  by  financing  the  building  of  high-quality \nphysical infrastructure in the region, especially in subregions where development gaps persist. \nWhile the overall financing gap remains huge, the AIF will play a critical role as an innovative \nsource of financing for priority projects, based on a catalytic partnership with ADB. \n \n9.  Furthermore, during the initial period, the AIF aims to finance the public portion of PPP \nprojects; the AIF can also undertake financing the private portion after it develops a good track \nrecord. At the same time, the AIF is financing infrastructure hardware to help anchor and \ncomplement the continued work by ASEAN and ADB to promote \u2015software\u2016 development for \nconnectivity  -  including  the  cross-border  transport  agreements,  and  customs  reform,  as \nstipulated in the MPAC.    \n \nC.  Outputs \n10.      The AIF will have three main development outputs: (i) additional financing for improved \ninfrastructure; (ii) enhanced private sector participation in infrastructure development through \nPPPs; and, (iii) support for MPAC implementation for the region. These outputs will lead to \nincreased financing for priority ASEAN infrastructure projects, maximized development impact \nby combining the resources of ASEAN and ADB, and catalyzed private sector investments via \nthe AIF's support for the public portions of PPP projects initially, and direct engagement in \nprivate sector projects after a strong track record has been developed. The primary targets are \noutlined below: \n                                                \n3  As of January 2011.  \n4  The AIF further aims to maximize synergy with other ASEAN initiatives, including the Asian Bond Market Initiative. \n \n ", "3 \n \n(i)  Annual lending. Projected lending approval of around $300 million (starting 2012) \nwith lending approval growth of 10% reaching to $440 million annually by 2016. \n \n(ii)  Number of projects (2012\u20132013). About six projects per year. \n \n(iii)  Share of regional projects.5  At least 30%. \n \n(iv)  Leverage. The AIF\u2019s total lending commitment until 2020 is estimated at about $3.6 \nbillion. Assuming 70% cofinancing by ADB, the AIF, contributing around 30%, can \nlead to a total commitment of more than $12 billion by 2020. In addition, further \ncofinancing can be attained from other development partners, including from private \ninstitutions in case of nonsovereign operations. \n \nD.  Proposed AIF Design \n \n11.      The AIF business model. The AIF's capital structure will comprise equity by the ASEAN \nshareholders and ADB, and debt which is expected to be held by various investors including the \nASEAN central banks. The AIF will lend for long-tenor sovereign or sovereign guaranteed \ninfrastructure  projects,  including  public  portions  of  PPP projects,  beginning  in  2012.  Every \nsovereign or sovereign-guaranteed project financed by the AIF will also be cofinanced by ADB. \nThe loan proceeds will be provided through ADB as the lender of record for the AIF.   \n \n12.      The AIF will begin its operations with the equity contributions provided by nine ASEAN \nshareholders and ADB.  This is expected to be augmented by hybrid capital,6 which is issued \nafter  about  4-5  years  of  operations.  The  ASEAN  shareholders  will  participate  directly  by \nproviding equity capital. The source of equity contributions may vary across the countries, \nsubject to country-specific circumstances. Once the AIF establishes a track record (after about 5 \nyears of operations), it will issue debt. Debt issuance is an important feature of the AIF\u2019s \nbusiness model\u2014since it is designed to target the use of the region\u2019s foreign exchange reserves \n(while maintaining their reserve eligibility) based on high investment grade credit rating and \nsufficient liquidity.7 ADB has sought the advice of rating advisory services to guide the process \nof obtaining a credit rating, which would be required when the AIF issues debt. Specifically, for \ncentral banks, the purchase is expected eventually to attain eligibility as foreign exchange \nreserves as the AIF securities issued in freely usable foreign currency attains a clear track \nrecord and sufficient lending volume (important for liquidity and/or marketability of the AIF \nbonds).8 Additional debt investments are also possible through pension funds, sovereign wealth \n                                                \n5  The AIF will use ADB\u2019s definition of regional projects \u2013 including cross-border projects and national projects with \nsignificant regional impact.  \n6  Hybrid capital refers to a financial instrument that has some characteristics of both debt and shareholder's equity. A \nportion of the proceeds are considered equity capital by regulators and rating agencies. Hybrid instruments are \nincluded  as  eligible  Tier-I capital  in  the  Basel-III  framework  depending  on  the  design  characteristic of  the \ninstrument.  Like the regulators, rating agencies view hybrid as a positive factor and are comfortable with providing \nequity credit.  \n7  High investment grade long-term credit rating is considered as \u2015A/A2\u2016 to \u2015AA/Aa2\u2016.   \n8  The International Monetary Fund\u2019s (IMF) International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity-Guidelines has \nprovided guidance on how national authorities might apply the reserve guidelines to the determination of whether \nparticular assets should be treated  as international reserves. IMF has clarified that: (i) the requirement for reserve \nassets to be external means that they should be claims on non-residents rather than residents; (ii) to be \u2015readily \navailable\u2016 the assets should be denominated in a convertible or freely usable foreign currency and should also be \nhighly liquid; and (iii) it is desirable that reserve assets be of \u2015high\u2016 credit quality (investment grade and above). \n ", "4 \nfunds, commercial banks and other forms of the region\u2019s savings.

Equity structure. The AIF will be established with a total equity contribution of $485.2 \nmillion. Nine ASEAN members have agreed to contribute $335.2 million in equity, while ADB \nhas been requested to provide $150 million.9 The equity contributions will be divided into three \nannual  tranches.    In  addition,  about  $162  million  will  later  be  added  from  hybrid  capital, \naugmenting the equity resources. Table 3 presents the equity contribution for the AIF.10 \n \n14.      Debt. The AIF plans to issue debt around 5 years after it commences operations. To \nensure that the AIF is an effective financial intermediary, the AIF should ensure its ability to \naccess capital markets at terms suitable for development purposes. For this, the stand-alone \nfinancial strength of an entity is extremely important. Such financial strength, which will be \nassessed by rating agencies, will be based on (i) strong shareholder support; (ii) prudent \nfinancial policies (including adequacy of capital, credit quality of the loan portfolio, and liquidity \nmanagement); and (iii) ADB\u2019s operational experience (including project lending, cofinancing,  \ncorporate governance and institutionalization of the new entity). Most importantly, with ADB as \ncofinancier and lender of record, the AIF loans will derive comfort from cross-default with ADB \nloans. These considerations and an initial leverage target based on a good track record are \nexpected to enable the AIF to achieve in due course a high, investment-grade rating from major \ninternational rating agencies. \n                                                                                                                                                       \nADB and the AIF will continue to monitor any major changes in the investment guidelines of the ASEAN central \nbanks.  \n9  ASEAN members recognize the long-term requirements for the AIF to fulfill its development objectives. However, \nthe shareholders also agreed that there should be a comprehensive review of the AIF operations around 2014, \nprior to hybrid capital and bond issuance and before commencement of any nonsovereign operations. Another \nsuch review is anticipated in 2016, at which time options on changes to the capital structure of the AIF will be \nconsidered, in light of the performance of the AIF and the equity investment climate at that time. \n10  It  should  be  noted  that  other  sovereigns  (including  those  outside  ASEAN)  may  provide  additional  equity \ncontributions to the AIF at a later time. \n \n ", "5 \n \n \nTable 3: Equity Contributions for the ASEAN Infrastructure Fund \n($ million) \nItem  Tranche 1  Tranche 2  Tranche 3  Subtotal \nASEAN  111.8  111.6  111.6  335.2 \n- Brunei Darussalam  3.4  3.3  3.3  10.0 \n- Cambodia  Unit  0.1 \n- Indonesia  40.0  40.0  40.0  120.0 \n- Lao PDR  Unit  0.1 \n- Malaysia  50.0  50.0  50.0  150.0 \n- Philippines  5.0  5.0  5.0  15.0 \n- Singapore  5.0  5.0  5.0  15.0 \n- Thailand  5.0  5.0  5.0  15.0 \n- Viet Nam  3.4  3.3  3.3  10.0 \nADB  50.0  50.0  50.0  150.0 \nSubtotal  161.8  161.6  161.6  485.2 \nHybrid Capital        162.0 \nTotal  161.8  161.6  161.6  647.2 \nNote: Cambodia and Lao PDR will purchase a set of equity units for around \n$100,000 each.  \nSource: ADB estimates. \n   \n15.      Pricing and return. The development-oriented approach of the AIF with loans based on \ncost-pass-through pricing policy will limit the AIF\u2019s risk. Delegation of the AIF administration to \nADB without incurring the AIF staffing costs will help minimize the AIF\u2019s costs for its borrowers. \nIt would be possible for the AIF to increase its returns to make itself more attractive to private \ninvestors, but this would imply a sharp increase in its pricing. Table 4 summarizes the overall \nfeatures.  \n \n16.      Current project pipeline. ADB has prepared a preliminary project pipeline for 2012\u2013\n2013, based on initial country consultations. The pipeline emphasizes project diversification \nthrough 3-year rolling exposure limits for individual countries, sectors, and projects to strengthen \nthe  AIF\u2019s  portfolio  credit  quality.  Accordingly,  the  following  exposure  limits  have  been \nconsidered for business planning: (i) 30% per country, (ii) 40% per sector, and (iii) a single-\nproject limit of $75 million. The preliminary list of projects requires confirmation from borrowing \ngovernments. The AIF board will actively review and approve the project pipeline prior to the \nstart of the AIF\u2019s operational lending program. Further adjustments will be needed to fully \nadhere to the exposure limits as described above. \n \n17.      Projects will be from the larger pipeline of potential requirements identified by individual \nASEAN members jointly with ADB during regular country partnership strategy process and \nconsultations  or  as  part  of  regional  cooperation  initiatives  such  as  the  Greater  Mekong \nSubregion  program,  the  Brunei-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines  East  ASEAN  Growth  Area \nprogram or the Indonesia-Malaysia-Thailand Growth Triangle program. ADB may examine any \nviable sovereign or sovereign-guaranteed project proposal for the AIF financing based on the \nprinciples endorsed by participating ASEAN members.11 \n                                                \n11 In addition, the AIF will support the implementation of the MPAC, which has identified a number of key projects to \nfacilitate physical and policy connectivity among the member countries. \n ", "6 \n \n \n \nTable 4: Administration and Financing of the ASEAN Infrastructure Fund \nParameters  Key Features \nPricing  Sovereign and sovereign-guaranteed projects: Cost of borrowing plus the AIF\u2019s \nlending spread (ADB's current lending spread is 40 basis points).  \nNonsovereign projects: market determined \nReturns  Equity holders: The average return on equity is projected to follow the 6-month \nLIBOR rate. \nDebt holders: Equivalent to the credit spread of high investment-grade bonds \nfrom corporate/quasi-sovereign entity. \nHybrid capital holders: Similar to the bonds, the return for the hybrid capital \nholders will be equivalent to the credit spread of high investment-grade rating.   \nAdministrative fee  An annual fee of 40 basis points on the AIF assets to help cover the costs \nincurred by ADB in administering the AIF.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n18.      Nonsovereign projects. While the AIF will engage only in sovereign operations during \nits initial operations, once a strong track record has been developed, the AIF board may decide \nto expand to nonsovereign (private) operations.  This phased approach is considered to be a \nprudent way to ensure that the AIF receives a high investment-grade rating, as nonsovereign \noperations without full sovereign guarantees are considered to be inherently more risky than \nsovereign operations.   \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.      ADB's role. The participating ASEAN members have requested ADB to provide the full \nrange  of  services  relating  to  project  sourcing,  design,  execution,  implementation,  and \nevaluation, as well as the management of the AIF funds.12 ADB has been requested to act as \nthe lender of record for all AIF loans to maximize benefits associated with processing and \nadministration by ADB. ADB will provide these services to the AIF under an express delegation \nof powers from and other terms and conditions agreed with the AIF board. The mobilization of \nresources from within ASEAN will supplement and complement the resource pool of ADB, while \ntapping  ADB\u2019s  experience  in  infrastructure  development.  This  model  of  pooling  resources, \nknowledge, and experience will significantly reduce transaction cost and provide a significant \ncomfort level to the credit rating agencies \n \n20.      For ASEAN, ADB will submit a project pipeline and a detailed annual report on the AIF, \nincluding financial statements and relevant financial and operational projections, for discussion \nat the AIF board meetings.13 The specific details of the AIF\u2019s governance structure are provided \nbelow (paras. 23-24).14 ADB's accountability to its Board of Directors will be through the regular \nproject approval and reporting processes. \n                                                \n12  The administration of the AIF will be undertaken by an interdepartmental working group. \n13The  AIF  legal  documents  will  clearly state  the  specific  functions  and  scope  (including  information  sharing, \nindemnification of ADB as administrator, except in case of gross negligence) of each role that ADB will undertake. \nDetailed discussions of this delegation of power have been held among the ASEAN shareholders and ADB. \n14 In addition, it should be noted that all ASEAN members are represented on the ADB Board, which will facilitate the \ncommunication among ADB and the ASEAN members.    \n \n ", "7 \n \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial \n21.      Demand  assessment.  Total  infrastructure  investment  requirements  in  ASEAN  are \nformidable, at over $60 billion per year for the next 10 years. On average, the public sector \n(national and subnational governments, and state-owned enterprises) should meet about 35%\u2013\n40% of these requirements. Multilateral and bilateral institutions may contribute about 10-12%, \nand the rest should be mobilized from the private sector, including national and foreign financial \ninstitutions. At present, the public sector is unable to exceed about 20% because of fiscal \nconstraints, and the private sector also invests only the same amount or less in the absence of \nrobust risk-sharing  arrangements.  As  a  result,  a  solid  pipeline  of  projects  will  need  to  be \nfinanced by new mechanisms such as the AIF.  \n \n22.      Financial assessment. The retained earnings operating under a targeted debt-to-equity \nratio of 1.5:1 will result in an increase of the value of equity; assuming each share has a face \nvalue of $10,000, the book value of these equity shares is projected to become $16,642 by \n2026 at a compounded annual growth rate of 3.7%.15 The AIF will begin issuing long-term debt \nin around 2016 with a moving 5-year average funding plan of about $275 million to be raised to \nan average of $450 million to $500 million from 2021.16 The speed of leverage is gradual with \nan incremental increase in the debt\u2013equity ratio.  \n \nB.  Governance \n23.      Board of Directors. The AIF\u2019s board of directors is the ultimate decision making body. \nIts main functions include the consideration and approval of the selection criteria for projects to \nbe financed by the AIF and a rolling 3-year project pipeline that will be a part of the overall AIF \nannual report, in a form of project concept paper, to be prepared by ADB.17 Each of the \nshareholders will be represented on the AIF board. It will meet at least once a year and from \ntime to time, as appropriate. All decisions taken at a duly constituted Board meeting, except with \nrespect to the fundamental issues18 shall be decided by the shareholders who hold more than \n50% of the voting power in the AIF and at least 50% of the number of shareholders.  \n \n24.      AIF domicile. As agreed among the participating ASEAN members, the AIF will be \ndomiciled in Malaysia as a limited liability company, and thus its operations will be consistent \nwith Malaysia's legal framework. The Government of Malaysia has indicated that it will seek to \nenact special legislation for the AIF\u2019s benefit generally, including exemption of the AIF from \nforeign exchange controls and from all Malaysian taxation.  \n \n \n                                                \n15  The projections for key financial parameters and operations over the next 15 years, and additional explanation on \nthe AIF cash flow projections are in Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16 This is assuming a recapitalization of the AIF by around 2018. For ADB, this is subject to the ADB Board approval; \nthe ASEAN members (or any other future shareholders of the AIF) will also need to support the recapitalization. It \nhas been emphasized that the AIF establishment does not commit any shareholder on recapitalization. \n17  If there is a significant and material change in the scope of any project or it is not processed after the pipeline \napproval, the administrator (ADB) will report this to the AIF board.  \n18 The AIF board\u2019s approval of fundamental issues will require a super-majority of 67% of the votes and 67% of the \nnumber of shareholders.  \n ", "8 \nC.  Poverty and Social Impacts \n25.      Major poverty and social impacts of the AIF will include (i) promotion of economic growth \nand employment generation; (ii) expansion of basic infrastructure, especially for the poor; and \n(iii) facilitation of trade and investments through more efficient infrastructure.  It will help to \nprovide people with greater access to energy, power, clean water and sanitation, and improve \ntheir mobility through better forms of transportation. In addition, the AIF can also support rural \ndevelopment and cross-border projects.   \n \nD.  Safeguards \n26.      ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) will apply to all AIF projects.   \n \nE.  Investment Limitations \n27.      ADB\u2019s proposed equity contribution of $150 million in aggregate will exceed the single \nexposure limit of $75 million and 25% of the total equity.19 The proposed amount is, however, \nconsidered to be appropriate given the commitments of  the ASEAN shareholders and the \nimportant role that the AIF will play in financing of infrastructure development in ASEAN. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n28.      The main issues related to risks and mitigation measures on the AIF capital structure are \npresented below. The development impact and innovative nature of this project are deemed to \noutweigh the risks.   \n \nTable 5: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nEquity: Delay in  The country commitment and payment schedule was confirmed by ASEAN shareholders in \nequity contributions  July 2011. The AIF will not start operations unless and until at least 80% of the first tranche \npaid-in capital has been contributed. \nDebt: Difficulties in  A high, investment-grade rating is preferred to ensure that the central banks can invest their \nattaining a high  foreign reserves. If the AIF does not attain such a rating, it will need to adjust its projected \ninvestment grade  lending rate, lending volume, and return on equity. However, credit rating agencies and \ncredit rating   advisors have indicated that the following are key mitigating factors:  \n(i)  Shareholders\u2019 Support: The AIF is owned by ASEAN sovereigns and ADB and will \nlend to the same ASEAN sovereigns on infrastructure \u2013 thus, a perception of default is \nminimized. The AIF board, representing the ASEAN sovereigns and ADB, will provide \nadditional assurance of strong ownership support. Malaysia will issue special legislation \nfor the AIF\u2019s benefit generally. \n(ii)  Sovereign Borrowers\u2019 and ADB\u2019s Role: ADB will provide a cross-default arrangement \nthrough  the  complementary  financing  scheme;  ADB  will  cofinance,  process,  and \nimplement all AIF projects; ADB will administer the AIF on relevant aspects, including \nfinancial management. A set of exposure limits by sector and country and per project is \nin place to ensure the diversification of the project portfolio.  \n(iii)  Region\u2019s History and Dynamics: While the individual sovereign ratings tend to be \nlow, collectively the region has a good history of low defaults. ASEAN has been an \nestablished group for many years and interacts with partner countries outside ASEAN \n(e.g., the +3 process). Credit rating agencies have recognized this by introducing a \n                                                \n19 The maximum amount of ADB\u2019s direct equity contribution shall be the lower of (i) $75 million or (ii) an amount equal \nto 25% of the net worth of the investee (inclusive of ADB\u2019s investment).

For the debt issuance around 2016, the AIF will have a regular \nreview process of the financial framework, further scrutiny on the AIF track record, \nshareholders  support,  credit  quality  of  portfolio  (its  concentration),  financial \nmanagement (leverage ratio, capital adequacy, liquidity), comparator institutions and \nalternatives, to enable a high rating.  \nHybrid Capital:  The AIF plans to structure its hybrid capital within the approval norms of rating agencies and \nChallenges in  as per the Basel-III criteria requiring stringent loss absorbing features. Based on the \nattracting buyers  expected rating of the hybrid capital, current market size, and initial discussions with the \nregion\u2019s pension funds and sovereign wealth funds, identifying the market for the hybrid \ncapital is not deemed to be overly challenging.  \nSource: ADB.  \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n29.      All AIF shareholders have agreed that all projects financed by the AIF shall conform to \nall  of  ADB's  mandatory  policies  on  anticorruption,  procurement,  consulting  services, \ndisbursement, accountability mechanism, and others as appropriate. In addition, each ASEAN \nshareholder has agreed to appoint ADB to administer the AIF, including the management and \ndisbursement of the AIF funds according to agreed terms and conditions. Accordingly, it is \nconsidered that a project administration manual would not be needed.  \n \n30.      All the AIF shareholders have agreed that the AIF will commence operations only after at \nleast 80% of the first tranche equity contributions have been contributed. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n31.      I am satisfied that the proposed equity contribution in the ASEAN Infrastructure Fund \n(AIF) would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and \nrecommend that the Board approve the following: \n \n(i)  the contribution in the AIF from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources of $50,000,000 \nannually for 3 years, commencing from 2011, on terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in this report, and as may be \nreported to the Board;  \n \n(ii)  the administration of the AIF by ADB, as described more fully in paragraphs 19\u2013\n20 of this report; and \n \n(iii)  the  waiver  of  the  single  exposure  limit  in  terms  of  contribution  amount  and \npercentage of equity, as described more fully in paragraph 27 of this report. \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n \n25 August 2011 \n ", "10  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nPerformance Targets \nand/or Indicators with  Data Sources and/or  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Baseline  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact  The effective use of the  Various reports and  Assumptions \ndomestic savings and  findings from the AIF  Continued economic \nEnhanced access to \nforeign exchange reserves  and political stability in \nkey infrastructure  Various sector reports \nfor infrastructure financing  ASEAN \nservices in ASEAN to  by ADB and other \npromote inclusive  Increased investments in  development partners  Continued economic \neconomic growth and  infrastructure from both  growth in ASEAN \nVarious reports by the \ntrade and investment  public and private sources \ngovernments and the  Conducive policy \nactivities. \nReduced costs and  ASEAN Secretariat  environment to channel \nfinancing gaps associated  the savings and \nADB estimates \nwith infrastructure within  reserves for \nASEAN   development purposes \nRisks \nGovernments and \nprivate sector reduce \ntheir investments due to \nexogenous factors \nOutcome  About $25 billion of  Asian Development  Assumptions \ninvestments generated  Outlook \nGreater connectivity  Effective operations of \nduring 2012\u20132020 in \nto achieve the  Various reports on  the AIF \ninfrastructure within \nobjectives of the  infrastructure issued by \nASEAN leading to  Continued partnership \nASEAN Economic  international agencies, \nincreased trade and  between ADB and the \nCommunity (2015),  the governments and the \ninvestments    governments \nincluding pooling of  ASEAN Secretariat \nthe resources through    The AIF\u2019s ability to \nData on private \nenhanced  catalyze additional \ninvestments  \ninfrastructure.  investments from other \nADB estimates  development partners \nand private sector   \nRisks \nDelay in equity \ncontributions \nRequired credit rating \nfor the AIF  \nChallenges in attracting \nbuyers for hybrid capital \nOutputs  About six infrastructure  Agreements among  Assumptions \nprojects financed every  ASEAN and ADB on the  Commitment from \n1.
