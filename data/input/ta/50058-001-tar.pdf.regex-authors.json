INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  midterm review of the long term strategic framework,1 and the Operational Plan for \nAgriculture  and  Natural  Resources,  2015\u20132020  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nemphasized on  investing more in the agriculture and natural resources (ANR) sector. More \ninvestment is required to revitalize the ANR sector as a key driver of inclusive growth and to \npromote food security in the region. Other challenges that affect agricultural growth and food \nsecurity include climate change and shrinking natural resources. This implies that investment \nhas  to  be  supported  by  high-level  technology  (HLT)2  for  climate  resiliency,  productivity \nenhancement, and better supply chain management to promote food security. The proposed \nresearch and development technical assistance (TA) will  identify the priority actions to be \nundertaken by ADB and developing member countries (DMCs) to mobilize investment and \npromote use of HLT in the ANR sector to produce more food in the region.    \n \n2.  The  TA  builds  on  two  previous  TA  projects3  that  developed  the  high-yielding  rice \nvarieties and site-specific crop management packages for cultivation in water-short areas; and \nexamined value chain financing for selected crops. The proposed TA will complement the \naccomplishments of those TA projects by identifying priority actions to mobilize investments and \nby promoting the use of HLT in agricultural production, distribution, and the value addition, \nwhich will also complement the ongoing TA on Building Sustainable Food and Nutrition Security \nin Asia and the Pacific.4 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.5  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  About 490 million people in Asia and the Pacific still suffer from chronic hunger.6 The \nnumber is down from 552 million in 2013.7 The complexity of food insecurity is exacerbated by \nthe growth of middle-income consumers and rapid urbanization, aging populations and youth \nout-migration, climate change, and natural resource degradation. More investment, appropriate \nHLT, and new infrastructure are the key requirements to address this tall order and promote \nfood security. The Food Security Forum, held at ADB headquarters 22\u201324 June 2016, also \nhighlighted these issues for policy support and actions.   \n \n4.   Firstly,  mobilizing  new  investments  in  the  ANR  sector  is  part  of  government \ndevelopment plans in most DMCs, albeit with varying importance and focus. The need for \ninvestments  also  varies  across  agriculture  subsectors  within  a  country,  which  makes  the \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2014.

Thus, \nincreased efficiency of existing technology and/or the introduction of information and communication technology, e-\ncommerce, and drip irrigation can be identified as HLT.  \n3 ADB. 2011.

The proposed TA will \nconduct an analysis to (i) estimate the total investments required in the ANR sector by taking \naccount of changing climate and ongoing economic and demographic transitions to produce \nadequate food to meet the demand in the region by 2030, (ii) prioritize areas for investment in \nselected DMCs, and (iii) suggest actions to be taken by governments and other stakeholders to \nmobilize new investments in the prioritized areas. \n \n5.  Secondly,  climate  change  will  affect  every  area  of  agricultural  production  and  food \nsecurity in almost all DMCs. Difficult choices for many DMCs are already looming about the \ncompeting use of water between agriculture and other sectors.8 The majority of the nearly 500 \nmillion of the rural poor in Asia and the Pacific are subsistence farmers who depend mainly on \nrain-fed agriculture,9 climate change causing less rainfall will seriously affect them. Application \nof HLT will be able to help farmers address these new challenges. Therefore farmers\u2019 access to \naffordable HLT for climate change adaptation and mitigation will continue to play an important \nrole in enhancing agricultural yield and promoting food security. The proposed TA will identify \nsuccessful technologies that are currently available in the ANR sector and the actions required \nto promote their wider use by the farmers from all strata. It will also analyze how HLT can be \neffectively disseminated among the farmers and how DMCs can apply it in their ANR operations \nto produce more food in an era of climate change. \n \n6.  Thirdly, the current agricultural distribution channels in most DMCs are unable to support \nreliable supply of fresh and safe food to growing urban consumers.  These channels are mostly \ndominated by thousands of unregulated intermediaries who collect products from millions of \nfarmers.10 Due to the dispersed nature of farming activities and the lack of coordination with \nlogistics providers, reliable supply of safe and fresh food becomes difficult. If these suppliers are \nlinked to larger distribution channels and market infrastructure, the supply of fresh food will \nimprove. It will also make it easier for the respective regulatory authorities to monitor, detect, \nand promote safe and fresh food.    \n \n7.  One of the major elements of the food distribution channel is a fresh food wholesale \nmarket.11 For emerging economies in Asia, where urbanization is happening at a rapid pace, \nwholesale markets are envisaged to play a major role in food security and  the growth of \nagribusiness. The proposed TA will develop custom-tailored models of wholesale markets for \nselected DMCs. It will also train government officials on the awareness and implementation of \nthese models.   \n \n8.  While the analysis of investment (output 1) will identify the priority actions to mobilize \nmore investments in ANR, the review of HLT (output 2) will help to sequence them, and the \npromotion of wholesale markets (output 3) will also help to increase investments in distribution \nand market infrastructure. Thus, the TA will help to increase investment in the farming and agri-\nlogistic sectors.  \n                                                \n8 Asia and the Pacific has the world\u2019s lowest available water on a per capita basis\u20145,224 cubic meters compared \nwith the world average of 8,349 cubic meters.

However, the \noperators in these markets are private wholesalers and producer cooperatives.   \n ", "3 \nIII.  THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact of the proposed TA will be increased investments in farming and agri-\nlogistics. The outcome will be increased knowledge of governments and ADB about identifying \nappropriate ANR projects.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The  TA  will  support  analytical  works,  pilot  frontier  technologies,  and  knowledge \ndissemination in DMCs.12 It will support (i) estimating the total investments required in the ANR \nsector to achieve food security in Asia and the Pacific by 2030 by taking account of climate \nchange and economic and demographic transitions, (ii) analyzing to identify priority areas for \ninvestments  in  the  ANR  sector  in  selected  DMCs,  (iii)  stocktaking  of  existing  successful \ntechnologies and identifying actions required to scale them up, (iv) piloting HLTs, (v) preparing \nan integrated supply model (wholesale market) for fresh and safe food, and (vi) disseminating \nknowledge. The three outputs shown in paras. 11\u201313 will lead to the accomplishment of the TA \noutcome, which will eventually help  to increase investments in farming activities and agri-\nlogistics. \n \n11.  Output 1: Overall agricultural investment requirement and prioritized areas for \ninvestment identified in developing member countries. A comprehensive review of trends \nand patterns of investment in ANR sectors in Asia and the Pacific since 2010 will be carried out \nto identify the main obstacles. The review will identify the institutional and policy barriers to \ninvestment.  A  group  of  IFPRI  experts  will  estimate  the  total  investment  requirement  in \nagricultural production related infrastructure to promote food security in the region by using an \nexisting economic model. The analysis will be done by taking account of climate change and \neconomic and demographic transitions in the region. The investment situation in up to three \nDMCs will be analyzed to prioritize actions and subsectors within agricultural sectors to promote \nprivate  and  public  investments  to  promote  food  security.  These  studies  will  be  internally \nreviewed and evaluated for quality control before presenting at knowledge dissemination events \nthat ADB staff and DMC officials will attend. \n \n12.  Output 2: Climate-resilient agricultural technology promoted and disseminated in \nselected  developing  member  countries.  A  comprehensive  review  of  the  current  use  of \ndifferent high-level technologies, such as reduced or zero tillage (ZT), machine seeding or \ntransplanting, water-efficient alternate wetting and drying (AWD), crop residue retention, crop \nrotation, and information and communication technology in rice and non-rice crops will be \nconducted. The review will analyze the affordability, development impacts, and sustainability of \nthese technologies and recommend policy and institutional support, appropriate logistics, and \nfinancing to scale them up. Climate-resilient technologies will be selected for piloting in at least \ntwo  countries  based  on  prior  trials  and  experiments,13  and  technical  and  environmental \n                                                \n12 In prioritizing the DMCs for this TA, three factors will be used: (i) active ANR loans and grants (in 2016), (ii) \nresources earmarked for ANR in country operations business plans, 2016\u20132018, and (ii) the country\u2019s food security \nranking in 2016. In addition to these factors, the rate of urbanization and growth of middle-income consumers will \nbe considered for output 3. At least one of the countries to be included in this TA will be selected from the Pacific \nDMCs. Prior to commencing or financing of any proposed activities under the TA, a no-objection in writing will be \nobtained from each selected DMC. \n13 Under the TA: \u201cDevelopment and Dissemination of Climate-Resilient Rice Varieties for Water-Short Areas of South \nAsia and Southeast Asia (footnote 3)\u201d, ADB supported dissemination of new rice technology in Bangladesh, \nCambodia, India, Lao PDR, and Nepal. \n ", "4   \nfeasibility, including adaptability to the situation of smallholders and female farmers. In addition \nto rice, the pilot projects will also focus on other crops such as vegetables produced after rice \nharvest.  The  implementation  arrangements  for  these  pilot  projects  will  be  finalized  in \nconsultation with the operational departments and concerned DMCs. Each pilot project will be \nmonitored and evaluated, and a report summarizing the outcomes and experiences will be \nprepared by the TA team for discussion. The findings of this output coupled with other outputs \nwill also be used for the capacity building of DMCs by promoting South\u2013South cooperation \nthrough a workshop. Target DMCs will be selected in consultation with regional departments.14 \n \n13.  Output 3: Knowledge on customized wholesale markets improved. The potential of \nwholesale markets in selected DMCs will be analyzed by the TA team by taking full cognizance \nof projected economic growth and urbanization\u2014the two main determinants of demand for safe \nand quality food. The legal and institutional environment will be assessed to recommend actions \nrequired to support the wholesale markets. Depending on the country context, custom-tailored \nmodels of wholesale markets for selected DMCs will be developed. Instead of carrying out an \nassessment of the wholesale market system, these models will focus on the mobilization of \ninvestment in this new market and distribution facilities and the use of HLT in their operation and \nmanagement. DMC government officials will be trained in the development and management of \nwholesale markets. \n   \n14.  For the outcome, the major risk is the lack of government interest in modernizing the \nagricultural  sector  and  agricultural  supply  chain.  Another  risk  arises  from  the  bias  of \ngovernments toward subsidizing agricultural inputs such as water, fertilizer, and pesticides. This \nbias may result in government apathy that prevents them from taking serious interest in the \nfindings of this TA. For the outputs, the main risks involve high turn-over of government officials \ntrained on wholesale markets, lack of an effective agricultural investment policy and guidelines \nfor climate-resilient growth, and limited interest in agri-logistics and fresh and safe food.  \n \n 15.  To minimize these risks, the TA team will work closely with the government, establish \ninter-ministerial committees, and facilitate dialogue among government agencies. \n  \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,500,000, which will be financed on a grant basis from \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The cost estimates and financing plan is in \nAppendix 2.  \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.    The TA will be implemented over 3 years, from October 2016 to October 2019.15 ADB \nwill execute the TA through the Agriculture, Rural Development, and Food Security Unit of the \nSustainable  Development  and  Climate  Change  Department.  The  secretariat  of  the  Rural \nDevelopment and Food Security (Agriculture) Thematic Group will be responsible for the overall \nsupervision of the implementation. The secretariat will report to the thematic group committee \non  the  progress  and  consult  with  the  Climate-Smart  Agriculture  Working  Group  and \nAgribusiness Value Chain Working Group during the implementation of the TA. The secretariat \nwill also work closely with the other concerned operational departments and focal points to \ncoordinate the work of the consultants and ensure effective dissemination of the TA findings. \n                                                \n14 Initial criterion is discussed in concept paper.  \n15 Depending on the need to ensure the success of the planned pilot activities, the duration may be extended and the \namount of the TA budget may be increased.  \n ", "5 \n18.  For output 1, ADB will carry out analytical work with assistance from organizations with \nknowledge  and  expertise  in  investment  in  ANR  sectors  involving  12  person-months  of \ninternational consultants and 15 person-months of national consultants. The International Food \nPolicy Research Institute (IFPRI) will be engaged on a single-source selection basis to render \nthese consultancy services in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2013,  as  amended from  time to  time).16  IFPRI,  a  member  of the  Consultative  Group for \nInternational  Agricultural  Research,  is  an  international  center  of  excellence.  Single-source \nselection is justified because IFPRI has (i) multiple expertise in agriculture, rural development, \nand food security necessary for output 1; (ii) significant teams of technical and policy experts in \nthe field who can provide information and insights on ANR investment; and (iii) extensive \nexperience  working  collaboratively  in  the  sector  with  DMC  governments  and  ADB.  In \nimplementing the output, IFPRI will collaborate with other international, regional, and national \ncenters of excellence, as necessary.  \n \n19.  The  International  Rice  Research  Institute  (IRRI)  will  be  a  knowledge  partner  for \ndelivering output 2 under the knowledge partnership agreement signed with ADB on 23 June \n2016. IRRI is a well-established knowledge center that has expertise in agriculture and food \nsecurity, and is well placed to ensure collaboration among the governments of DMCs, ADB, and \nother agricultural centers of excellence. IRRI has the expertise and experiment centers for \nundertaking cutting edge research to address climate change and technology dissemination.      \n \n20.  For  output  3,  ADB  will  carry  out  relevant  works  with  the  help  of  firms  and/or \norganizations experienced in wholesale market development. The TA will engage consultants in \naccordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to \ntime). It will recruit international (6 person-months) and national consultants (6 person-months) \nthrough  firms.  For  the  recruitment,  the  fixed  budget  selection  method  will  be  adopted  for \nengaging firms and institutions.   \n \n21.  In  addition,  ADB  will  recruit  international  consultants  (8  person-months,  shown  as \nunallocated)  on  an  individual  basis  to  assist  in  coordinating  and  monitoring  the  overall \nimplementation of the TA and undertake other activities, as necessary. All disbursements under \nthe TA will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook \n(2010, as amended from time to time).  \n \n22.  The TA findings will be disseminated through project reports, conferences, workshops, \nknowledge events, and development networks. The TA team will produce a working paper for \nelectronic dissemination by ADB and its resident missions. This working paper will also be \nposted on the ADB website.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,500,000 on a grant basis \nfor Investment Assessment and Application of High-Level Technology for Food Security in Asia \nand the Pacific, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n16 ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time) will be followed in case of purchase of \nservices, equipment, or payments to conference venues.   \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the Technical Assistance is Aligned with \nInvestment in farming and agri-logistics increaseda \n \n  Performance Indicators  Data Sources and   \nResults Chain  with Targets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome       \n \nGovernments\u2019 and  a.
