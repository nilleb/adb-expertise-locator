THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed project \nreadiness  financing  (PRF)  loan  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  the  Transport \nConnectivity Improvement Preparatory Facility. \n \n2.  Bangladesh  requires  further  development  of  an  optimized  transport  network  with \nstrengthened intermodal connections to meet its rapidly growing transport demand. The objective \nof the facility is to support the Government of Bangladesh in advancing the preparation of road \nand railway projects by financing feasibility studies, detailed design, and other preparatory works. \nThese projects will improve transport connectivity and facilitate multimodal transport in the country \nand South Asia. \n \nII.  PROJECT READINESS FINANCING \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Bangladesh  economy.  Bangladesh,  with  a  population  of  165  million,  has  been \nexperiencing robust annual economic growth of 5% or higher since fiscal year (FY) 2004. \nBangladesh\u2019s annual economic growth of 7.9% in FY 2018 was the highest among Asian \ncountries, and it is forecasted to further grow by 8.1% in FY2019 and 8.0 % in FY2020.1 The \nproportion of population living below the national poverty line decreased from 31.5% in 2010 to \n24.3% in 2016, although this was still the highest proportion among South Asian countries.2 \nForeign trade is a vital engine of the country\u2019s economic growth. Foreign merchandise trade in \nBangladesh recorded a 480% increase in value from 2000 to 2017.3 This indicates that the \ncountry has the potential to grow further as a major exporter of labor-intensive products, including \ngarments.  Expansion  of  exports  is  expected  to  bring  about  economic  growth,  resulting  in \nincreased  incomes  that  will  contribute  to  boosting  domestic  consumption.  In  addition,  the \nproximity of Bangladesh to neighboring Southeast Asia provides the country with good prospects \nof becoming a regional trading hub. \n \n4.  Transport network in Bangladesh. Bangladesh\u2019s transport network consists of roads, \nrailways, inland waterways, seaports, and civil aviation. Among these, road is the predominant \nsubsector with a modal share of over 70% for passenger traffic and 60% for freight.4 The \ngovernment estimates that national road traffic volume is growing at an average rate of above \n10% per year.5 Rail is considered a safer, more reliable, and environmentally friendly transport \nmode in the country. Rail transport is also steadily increasing in traffic volume for passenger and \ncargo. Chattogram Port, formerly called Chittagong Port, is the national gateway port handling \nmore than 90% of the country\u2019s international cargo, and is the busiest container port in the Bay of \nBengal. It is expected that international container cargo volume will increase to 10.2 million \ntwenty-foot equivalent units in 2040.6  \n \n \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2019.

Manila. Twenty-foot equivalent units are used to count \ncontainer volume; a 40-foot container box is counted as two twenty-foot equivalent units. \n ", "2 \n5.  Transport connectivity for an optimized network. Bangladesh\u2019s transport network is a \nfundamental and critical infrastructure that supports the country\u2019s economic activities, including \ninternational trade. Insufficient transport infrastructure results in increased costs and transport \ntime,  reduced  competitiveness  and  efficiency  of  the  economy,  and  impeded  economic \nopportunities. Transport demand is expanding rapidly nationwide because of Bangladesh\u2019s young \nand growing population, and steady economic development. Thus, the government has been \nsubstantially investing in all subsectors to strengthen Bangladesh\u2019s transport network and support \nthe efficient, safe and sustainable movement of people and goods in the country and across the \nregion.  \n \n6.  Improvements in transport connectivity that will link subsectors are necessary towards an \nintegrated  transport  network. Insufficient transport  connectivity  in  the country  has  led to  a \ndisproportionate reliance on roads, causing congestion and inconvenience to users. Promoting \nmultimodal transport and optimized modal share will alleviate unbalanced transport demands in \nthe country. For example, utilizing freight trains and inland waterways for long-haul freight \ntransport between Dhaka and Chattogram Port is a potential solution to alleviate the congestion. \nHowever, this requires adequate transport connectivity with the road network at intermodal \ntransshipment facilities such as inland container depots and inland waterway terminals.  \n \n7.  Arterial transport corridors. Because of rapidly growing demand, the main road and rail \ncorridors  in  Bangladesh  face  severe  capacity  shortages.  Given  that  road  and  railway  are \nfundamental components of an integrated transport network, the alleviation of congestion along \narterial transport corridors is urgently needed. In tandem with the improvement of transport \nconnectivity, arterial transport corridors need to be strengthened through upgrades as well as \nthrough the construction of bypass roads and connecting roads. \n \n8.  Transport connectivity and intra-subregional trade. Intra-subregional trade in South \nAsia is less active compared with that in other subregions such as the Association of Southeast \nAsian Nations and the European Union.7 The relatively low volume of intra-subregional trade \namong South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) countries is partly attributed to \ninsufficient  transport  connectivity,  and  incomplete  transport  network.  Subregional  transport \ncorridors, including the SASEC road corridors and the Trans-Asian Railway network, will link \nBangladesh with neighboring countries through border crossing points and land ports. The \ncorridors will provide access to international markets and economic opportunities not only for \nBangladesh, but also for neighboring countries through Bangladesh. However, international road \nand rail corridors are still being developed, and border crossing points and land ports are still \nphysically constrained because of insufficient road and rail connectivity, although the government \nhas declared 23 land ports. \n \n9.  Government  strategy.  The  government\u2019s  Seventh  Five-Year  Plan  prioritizes  the \nimprovement of the multimodal transport network, utilization of rail in long-haul freight traffic, \npromotion of regional connectivity, and reduction of urban traffic congestion, among others \n(footnote  4).  The  use of  a  long-haul freight  train  between  Dhaka  and  Chattogram  Port  is \nparticularly promoted by the government. Bangladesh Railway has established a container freight \ncompany and plans to expand the container freight yard next to Chattogram Port. Pilot operation \nof an international container train between Bangladesh and India was also conducted in 2018. \nThe Bangladesh Land Port Authority has declared 23 land ports as of March 2019, including six \n \n7  Intraregional trade as a share of total trade is 63.9% for the European Union and 22.8% for the Association of \nSoutheast Asian Nations, compared to an intra-subregional trade share of 5.0% for South Asia Subregional \nEconomic Cooperation (SASEC) countries. \n ", "3 \nland ports operated by the private sector. ADB is currently discussing with relevant government \nagencies about the ensuing support for land port and border management as another project. \n \n10.  Facility to support project preparation. The preparation of such projects to facilitate \ntransport connectivity among different subsectors has lagged behind actual development needs, \nand financial support is needed to advance this. In parallel with the government\u2019s plan to optimize \nthe country\u2019s transport network and to strengthen competitiveness of the economy, the PRF will \nsupport project preparation in the following areas: (i) road and rail connectivity of ports, land ports, \nand border crossing points; (ii) road and rail connectivity of intermodal transshipment facilities, \nincluding inland container depots and inland container terminals; (iii) strengthening of corridors, \nincluding bypasses, connected roads, and alternate routes; and (iv) sector-wide improvements, \nincluding safety, traffic management, and maintenance. Projects will be  selected in line with the \nproject  selection  criteria,  including  urgency  of the  needs, viability  for future financing,  and \ndevelopment  coordination.8 The  PRF  will  advance  the  preparation  of  ensuing  projects  by \nfinancing feasibility studies, detailed design, and other preparatory works. \n \n11.  ADB strategy and value addition. The PRF was newly institutionalized as an innovative \nfinancing modality in 2018  to ensure a high level of implementation readiness. The proposed \nfacility meets the strategic objectives of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country partnership \nstrategy  for  Bangladesh,  2016\u20132020,  particularly  by  (i)  easing  infrastructure  constraints  in \ntransport and urban development, (ii) creating conditions for greater private sector participation \nto attract investment, and (iii) helping Bangladesh take advantage of its location as a regional \ntransport and trade hub.9 ADB\u2019s engagement will complement strategies of other development \npartners by exploring the use of a sector-wide approach and pursuing comprehensive policy \ndialogues with the government. The facility will also expedite the preparation of projects for \nregional cooperation and integration in line with the SASEC Operational Plan, 2016\u20132025.10 In \naddition, the facility is aligned with the operational priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 as it will \ncontribute to the: (i) development of green and inclusive infrastructure as well as the reduction of \ngreenhouse gas emissions in transport; (ii) reducing inequality access to opportunities and \npromoting women\u2019s economic empowerment; and (iii) regional cooperation and integration.11 The \nfacility is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for Bangladesh, 2020\u20132022.12  \n \nB.  Output and Activities \n \n12.   Output:  Feasibility  studies,  detailed  design,  and  other  preparatory  works  for \nensuing projects completed. All preparatory works will be done to satisfy ADB\u2019s due diligence \nrequirements. The facility will assess risks of ensuing projects related to gender, labor, and other \nsocial issues during the preparation of the feasibility study and detailed design in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and other guidelines, as well as government guidelines \nand regulations. Participation of private sector in ensuing projects will be preliminarily assessed.  \n \n13.  Environmental impact assessments or initial environmental examinations, as applicable, \nwill  be  prepared  along  with  climate  risk  and  vulnerability  assessments  and  environmental \nmanagement plans for ensuing projects.

The government has requested a concessional loan of $42,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance project preparation and design activities. The loan will have a \n25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years; an interest rate of 2.0% per year during the \ngrace  period  and  thereafter  (the  interest  and  other  charges  during  implementation  to  be \ncapitalized in the loan); and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. \n \n18.

The project readiness loan will be repaid according to the loan agreement. However, \nduring implementation, a borrower may opt to refinance the project readiness loan under an \nensuing or ongoing loan with savings, in consideration of financial market conditions. Refinancing \nof the project readiness loan must take place before the first principal repayment date indicated \nin the amortization schedule of the loan agreement. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n20.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe PRF PAM (footnote 15). Procurement will follow the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as \namended from time to time), its associated staff instructions, and Procurement Regulations for \nADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements for Project Readiness Financing \nAspects  Arrangements \nPRF implementation period  18 February 2020\u201331 December 2024 \nEstimated PRF completion date  31 December 2024 \nEstimated loan closing date  30 June 2025 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight bodies  Ministry of Road Transport and Bridges, and Ministry of Railways \n(ii)  Executing agencies  Roads and Highways Department, and Bangladesh Railway \n(iii) Implementation unit  Dhaka, 10 staff (each executing agency will establish a project \nimplementation unit with 5 staff, led by a project director) \nConsulting services  QCBS (90:10):   3,200 person-months  $37,800,000 \n3 packages \nIndividual consultants  200 person-months  $2,000,000 \nAdvance contracting  Advance contracting will be applied to consultant recruitment. \nDisbursement  Disbursements under the PRF will follow ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed \narrangements agreed between the government and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, PRF = project readiness financing, QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n21.  Implementation  arrangements  were  designed  to  be  similar  to  previous  technical \nassistance loans that effectively advanced project readiness and processing in the country, prior \nto the introduction of the PRF as a new ADB modality.16 The technical assistance loans led to \nensuing loans for two road projects and two railway projects under ADB financing.  \n \n16 ADB. 2010.

The list of necessary investments which the PRF will support was prepared according to \nthe agreed project selection criteria (footnote 8). Ensuing projects will be selected from the list to \nimprove transport connectivity and facilitate multimodal transport. These investments are in line \nwith recent government priorities, including subregional cooperation and integration, intermodal \nconnection, and strengthening of industries. Most of the required investments (candidate projects) \nare identified in the Seventh Five-Year Plan (footnote 4) or the Railway Sector Master Plan toward \n2030.17 The detailed design will consider climate change impact, gender, environment, and other \nrequirements. The application of high-level technology will be explored during implementation. \nIndividual consultants will be mobilized to support the executing agencies in reviewing detailed \ndesign and other preparatory works by consulting firms to assure the quality of outputs, especially \non high-level and new technology. Consulting services are packaged to bundle multiple candidate \nprojects of the same subsector for consistency in preparation of projects and to determine priority \namong them. Such procurement packaging, combined with a selection method that places greater \nweight on the quality of proposals, will aim to achieve value for money. \n \nB.  Governance \n \n23.  The  Roads  and  Highways  Department  (RHD)  and  Bangladesh  Railway  will  be  the \nexecuting agencies of the facility. Both the RHD and Bangladesh Railway have implemented \nADB-funded projects and are familiar with ADB\u2019s project financial accounting and disbursement \nprocedures. One finance (account) official will be designated in each project implementation unit. \nIn addition, the RHD and Bangladesh Railway have participated in workshops to learn good \npractices  of  financial  management  systems.  The  overall  financial  management  capacity  is \nadequate, but given the country risk rating, the project risk is considered moderate. The main \nfinancial management risks are related to external audit, internal audit, and staffing. If ensuing \nprojects prepared under the facility will be implemented by another agency, the agency will \nundergo financial management assessment as well as other due diligence during appraisal of the \nensuing loans. \n \n24.  The procurement risk of the RHD and Bangladesh Railway is rated moderate, as only the \nconsultant recruitment is to be financed under the facility. Procurement of consulting services will \nbe conducted in line with the ADB Procurement Policy and the Procurement Regulations for ADB \nBorrowers. Disbursement will follow ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended \nfrom time to time). The advance fund and the statement of expenditure procedures will be applied \nto disbursements for national individual consultants. \n \n25.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government, the RHD, and Bangladesh Railway. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 15). \n \nC.  Safeguards \n \n26.  Since the proposed activities consist of consulting services only, the facility has not been \ncategorized  per  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  The  facility  will  support  the \n \n17 Government of Bangladesh, Ministry of Railways. 2013. Railway Sector Master Plan (to June 2030).

The  government,  the  RHD,  and  Bangladesh  Railway  have  assured  ADB  that  PRF \nimplementation  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning \nanticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and \ndisbursement as described in detail in the PAM and loan documents. \n \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n28.  I am satisfied that the proposed project readiness financing loan would comply with the \nArticles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board \napprove the loan of $42,000,000 to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Transport \nConnectivity  Improvement  Preparatory  Facility,  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  in \nconcessional terms, with an interest charge at the rate of 2% per year during the grace period \nand thereafter; for a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms \nand conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement \npresented to the Board. \n \n \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n \n \n14 January  2020 \n \n18  ADB.
