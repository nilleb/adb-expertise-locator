A review of its environmental implications indicates that \nseveral policy actions covered by the subprogram are likely to have a \npositive environmental impact. Enhancement measures have been \ndeveloped to optimize these positive impacts. No action has been \nidentified as likely to have an adverse environmental impact. \n   \nSubprogram  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved SIPRP V, a program \nDescription  cluster  consisting  of  three  subprograms,  and  a  loan  for  its \nsubprogram 1 in December 2008. SIPRP V is intended to help the \nGovernment of Viet Nam carry out policy reforms that are needed for \nthe successful implementation of its Socioeconomic Development \nPlan (SEDP) 2006\u20132010. To this end, SIPRP V is to provide parallel \nfinancing with the World Bank\u2019s poverty reduction support credits \n(PRSCs)  7\u20139  within  the  framework  of  the  PRSC  process. \nSubprogram 1 provided parallel financing with PRSC 7. \n \nSubprogram 2 will provide parallel financing with PRSC 8, covering a \nsubset of actions included in the policy matrix for PRSC 8. Like the \npolicy  actions  covered  by  subprogram  1,  the  actions  under \nsubprogram  2  fall  into  the  four  broad  reform  areas:  business \ndevelopment, social inclusion, natural resource management, and \ngovernance. They complement actions supported by ADB's other \nprogram  loans to  Viet Nam  or  are  otherwise  important to  ADB's \noperations in the country. Most of them were on the combined list of \ntentative actions under subprograms 2 and 3 in the original policy \n ", "ii   \nmatrix of SIPRP V. ADB staff took part in the consultations on these \nactions,  which  the  Government  and  the  development  agencies \nparticipating in the PRSC process held between December 2008 and \nMay 2009. All of the actions have been completed, although two of \nthem have not been carried out exactly as envisaged. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The impact and the outcome of the proposed subprogram are the \nsame as those of SIPRP V. The intended impact of SIPRP V is a \ncontinued  reduction  in  poverty  in  Viet  Nam  in  2008\u20132010  and \nbeyond. Its expected outcome is the successful implementation of \nthe  Government\u2019s  SEDP  2006\u20132010,  which  will  not  only  reduce \npoverty  in  2006\u20132010  but  also  improve  Viet  Nam\u2019s  economic \ncompetitiveness and strengthen the foundations for inclusive and \nsustainable  growth  and  a  continued  reduction  in  poverty  beyond \n2010. \n   \nCost Estimates  Some of the policy actions covered by subprogram 2 of SIPRP V \nentail substantial costs to Viet Nam\u2019s state budget. The total cost to \nthe state budget in 2009\u20132011 of the actions included in the policy \nmatrix for PRSC 8 is estimated at $680 million.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  The  World  Bank  has  already  approved  PRSC  8  amounting  to \n$350 million from the International Development Association. Other \ndevelopment agencies participating in the PRSC process (including \nADB) are expected to provide grants or concessional loans totaling \nabout $250 million in cofinancing or parallel financing with PRSC 8. \nThe remaining costs to the budget of the actions included in the \npolicy matrix for PRSC 8 will be covered by the Government. \n   \nLoan Amount and  It  is  proposed  that  a  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nTerms  SDR64,036,000 be provided for subprogram 2 from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources. The loan will have a term of 24 years, including a \ngrace period of 8 years; an annual interest rate of 1.0% during the \ngrace period and 1.5% during the amortization period; and other \nterms and conditions set forth in the Loan Agreement. The loan \nproceeds may be used to finance eligible imports incurred within \n180 days before the date of loan effectiveness.  \n   \nExecuting Agency  The State Bank of Viet Nam (SBV) is the Executing Agency for \nSIPRP V. As such, it will be the Executing Agency for the proposed \nsubprogram. \n   \nDisbursement  The proposed loan will be disbursed in a single tranche upon the \ndeclaration of loan effectiveness.  \n \nThe loan proceeds will be disbursed to the Socialist Republic of \nViet Nam  as  the  Borrower  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of \nADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related \nRequirements for Program Loans (1998).  \n   \n ", "  iii \nProcurement  The loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange \ncosts  (excluding  local  duties  and  taxes)  of  items  produced  and \nprocured in ADB member countries, excluding ineligible items and \nimports financed from other bilateral and multilateral sources. No \nsupporting import documentation will be required provided that the \nvalue of Viet Nam\u2019s total imports minus imports from nonmember \ncountries, ineligible imports, and imports financed under other official \ndevelopment assistance is at least equal to the amount of the loan to \nbe disbursed. The Government will certify its compliance with this \nformula with its withdrawal request. Otherwise, import documentation \nunder existing procedures will be required. ADB will have the right to \naudit the use of loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the \nBorrower\u2019s certification. \n \nPeriod of Utilization  The loan will be fully utilized by 31 May 2010. \n   \nSubprogram Benefits  The policy reforms that SIPRP V and, in particular, its subprogram 2 \nand Beneficiaries  are intended to advance will yield considerable economic benefits to \nViet Nam and substantial financial benefits to the Government. They \nwill raise the living standards of the Vietnamese people by fostering \nsocially inclusive and environmentally sustainable economic growth. \nThe reforms will also increase budget revenue by expanding the tax \nbase, and reduce budget expenditure by improving public financial \nmanagement. Over the medium term, the financial benefits of these \nreforms to the Government are likely to exceed their costs (including \ninterest  to  be  paid  on  loans  received  from  various  development \nagencies within the framework of the PRSC process). \n   \nAssumptions and  SIPRP V and, in particular, its subprogram 2 are to support policy \nRisks  actions that are critical steps in the policy reforms needed for the \nsuccessful implementation of SEDP 2006\u20132010 and are important to \nADB\u2019s operations in Viet Nam. However, the reforms need to be fully \ncarried out if SEDP 2006\u20132010 is to be successfully implemented. \nTherefore, it is assumed that, after completing the policy actions \ncovered by SIPRP V and the other actions included in the policy \nmatrices  for  the  World  Bank\u2019s  PRSCs  7\u20139,  the  Government  will \nfollow  through  with  the  policy  reforms  needed for  the  successful \nimplementation of SEDP 2006\u20132010 on its own or with the support of \ndevelopment agencies under other projects. It is further assumed \nthat the investment projects that are included in SEDP 2006\u20132010 \nand necessary for attaining its targets and goals will be implemented \non schedule.  \n \nThese assumptions are based on the Government\u2019s commitment to \ncarry out the policy reforms and implement the investment projects \nthat are needed to achieve the targets and goals of SEDP 2006\u2013\n2010. Furthermore, policy reforms that are needed for the successful \nimplementation of SEDP 2006\u20132010 are now or will be supported by \nADB through other policy-based loans to Viet Nam, and by other \ndevelopment  agencies  within  and  outside  the  framework  of  the \nPRSC process. \n ", "iv   \nThe slowdown of growth caused by the global economic crisis could \nbe so prolonged that it will preclude the successful implementation of \nSEDP 2006\u20132010 and, in particular, the achievement of its target \nrelated to the poverty rate. However, this risk is small. The fiscal \nstimulus  measures  adopted  by  the  Government  in  January\u2013May \n2009 are expected to spur growth in the second half of 2009 and in \n2010. Moreover, the external environment is expected to improve \nsignificantly in 2010. Accordingly, growth is likely to rebound in the \nsecond half of 2009 and accelerate further in 2010. \n \nAs economic growth accelerates and world commodity prices rise, \ninflation  could  surge  again.  High  inflation  could  push  many \nhouseholds into poverty and preclude the successful implementation \nof  SEDP  2006\u20132010.  To  mitigate  this  risk,  the  SBV  has  started \ntaking  measures  to  keep  inflation  in  check.  In  particular,  it  has \ncommitted to limit growth of money supply to 30% in 2009; asked \nstate-owned commercial banks to limit loan growth to 25% in 2009; \nand  urged  all  commercial  banks  to  tighten  credit  for  consumer \nspending  and  purchases  of  real  estate  and  stocks.  The  SBV  is \nexpected to start tightening monetary policy toward the end of 2009 \nand pursue moderately tight monetary policy in 2010. \n \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for subprogram 2 of the Support for the Implementation of \nthe Poverty Reduction Program (SIPRP) V. The updated design and monitoring framework for \nSIPRP V is in Appendix 1. \nII.  THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n2.  Viet Nam's economy expanded rapidly in the past 2 decades. Real gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) grew at the average annual rate of 7.4% in 1988\u20132007. Following a modest \nslowdown in 1998\u20131999 caused by the Asian financial crisis, growth of real GDP accelerated \nalmost steadily during 2000\u20132007, from 4.8% in 1999 to 8.5% in 2007.  \n \n3.  However, the country has been experiencing severe macroeconomic difficulties since \n2008.  Inflation  and  the  trade  deficit  surged  in  the  first  half  of  2008.  The  macroeconomic \nimbalances, which built up for several years and manifested themselves in inflation pressures \nand persistent trade deficits, were exacerbated by domestic supply-side shocks (such as poultry \nepidemics).  The  rise  in  world  commodity  prices  contributed  to  the  surge  in  inflation.  The \nGovernment responded by tightening monetary and fiscal policies and adopting other measures \nto stabilize the macroeconomic situation.  \n \n4.  In the second half of 2008, inflation fell sharply and the trade deficit narrowed, in part \nbecause of the stabilization measures of the Government in the first half of the year. The drop in \nworld commodity prices helped bring inflation down. At the same time, economic activity slowed \nmarkedly, as external demand weakened substantially. In response, the Government started \nloosening monetary and fiscal policies. Still, growth of real GDP decelerated to 6.2% in 2008 \nfrom more than 8.0% in the preceding 3 years (Table 1). \n \n5.  In  2008,  the  global  economic  crisis  slowed  the  growth  of  Viet  Nam's  exports  and \ncontributed to the decrease in portfolio investment inflows. It has had additional adverse impacts \non Viet Nam in 2009. In particular, the crisis has further crimped exports. It has also reduced \nrevenue  from  international  tourism  and  inflows  of  foreign  direct  investment  (FDI).  Exports \ndecreased by 10.2%, the number of international tourist arrivals fell by 22.1%, and gross FDI \ninflows declined by 22.5% in January\u2013June 2009 compared with the same period a year earlier. \nAccordingly, year-on-year growth of real GDP slowed to 3.9% in the first half of 2009, from 6.5% \nin the first half of 2008. With GDP most likely falling below its potential level, year-on-year \ninflation eased to 2.0% in August 2009 from 28.3% in August 2008. \n \n6.  The Government has adopted a range of measures to mitigate the adverse impact of the \nglobal economic crisis on growth and poverty in Viet Nam. These measures include one-off \nadditional financial assistance to poor households, housing support for the poor, and provision \nof interest-free short-term loans to firms that have had to shed at least 30% of their staff and are \nexperiencing difficulties in paying wages of the remaining staff. Furthermore, the Government \nhas increased the budgetary allocation for the existing social assistance programs, such as the \nprogram for poverty reduction in ethnic minority and mountainous areas (so-called Program 135) \nand  the  health  insurance  program  for  the  poor  and  near-poor.  It  has  also  expedited  the \nformulation and approval of the program for accelerated poverty reduction in the 61 poorest \ndistricts. In the central Government budget for 2009, $935 million has been allocated to social \nsafety nets, compared with $518 million spent on social safety nets from this budget in 2008. \n ", "2 \nTable 1: Country Economic Indicators  \n \nItem  2004  2005  2006  2007  2008  2009 \nA.

THE SECTOR \nA.  Sector Description and Performance  \n1.  Recent Progress in Poverty Reduction \n7.  Viet Nam reduced poverty dramatically in the past 15\u201320 years (Appendix 2). According \nto the most recent available household survey data, the poverty rate (based on the cost of a \nconsumption basket allowing for a daily intake of 2,100 calories per person and some nonfood \nexpenditure) dropped from 58.1% in 1993 to 16.0% in 2006.1 The food poverty rate fell from \n24.9% to 6.7% over the same period, while the poverty gap narrowed from 18.5% to 3.8%.2  \n \n8.  Measures of poverty not based on household survey data point to declines of similar \nmagnitudes in poverty, although they give different levels of poverty. In particular, the proportion \nof people living on less than $1.0 per day based on purchasing power parity (PPP) dropped \nfrom 50.8% of the population in 1990 to 4.0% in 2007, and the proportion living on less than \n$2.0  per  day  based  on  PPP  fell  from  87.0%  to  32.9%.3 The  poverty  rate  based  on  the \nmethodology of the Ministry of Labor, Invalids and Social Affairs (MOLISA) fell from 20.2% in \n2005 to an estimated 13.1% in 2008.4  \n \n9.  A combination of strong economic growth and more efficient social protection enabled \nViet Nam to make such great strides in poverty reduction.5 Economic growth created new jobs, \nraised incomes, and lifted millions of people out of poverty. However, growth alone would not \nhave enabled Viet Nam to reduce poverty as much as it has done. Many of those who did not \nbenefit directly from economic growth (often for reasons beyond their control) were lifted out of \npoverty or prevented from falling into poverty because more resources became available for \nsocial  protection  (thanks  to  the  strong  economic  growth)  and  social  protection  became \nsignificantly more efficient.  \n2.  Poverty Reduction Support Credit Process \n10.  The main reason why Viet Nam was able to sustain rapid economic growth for a long \ntime and to improve the efficiency of social protection significantly is that, since 1986, the \ncountry has carried out a broad range of policy reforms fostering sustainable and inclusive \neconomic growth and making social protection more targeted. In particular, Viet Nam has been \nundertaking a gradual transition from a command to a market economy, and from a social \nprotection  system  that  relies  heavily  on  price  subsidies  to  a  system  based  on  targeted \nprograms. It has also continually strengthened natural resource management and improved \ngovernance. Since 2002, more and more multilateral and bilateral development agencies have \nsupported these reforms through the poverty reduction support credit (PRSC) process led by \nthe World Bank.  \n                                                \n1  World Bank. 2007. Vietnam Development Report 2008: Social Protection. Joint donor report to the Vietnam \nConsultative Group Meeting, Hanoi, 6\u20137 December 2007. \n2  The food poverty rate is the proportion of people whose total expenditure would not be enough for a daily intake of \n2,100 calories even if it were entirely allocated to food. The poverty gap is the difference between the poverty line \nand the average expenditure of the poor expressed as a percentage of the former. \n3   World Bank. 2008. East Asia: Testing Times Ahead. Washington, DC. \n4  The poverty rate based on the methodology of MOLISA measures the proportion of people living below the official \npoverty line, which is D260,000 per person in urban areas and D200,000 per person in rural areas. Households \nbelow  the  poverty line  are identified  by local  officials  of  MOLISA  through  a  combination  of  their  personal \nknowledge, survey techniques, and village discussions.  \n5   Although economic growth slowed in 2008, it was still faster than that in many other countries around the world. \n ", "4 \n \n11.  The PRSC process comprises several closely related activities jointly undertaken each \nyear by participating development agencies to help the Government carry out the policy reforms \nneeded  for  the  successful  implementation  of  its  poverty  reduction  strategy.  The  process \ninvolves  the  preparation  of  Viet  Nam  development  reports  by  participating  agencies, \nconsultations on the policy matrices for the World Bank\u2019s PRSCs among participating agencies \nand between these agencies and the Government, and general budget support (in the form of \ngrants and concessional loans) to Viet Nam by participating agencies to cover some of the \nadjustment costs of the policy reforms to the budget. The World Bank coordinates PRSC \nactivities for the participating development agencies. \n  \n12.  While the Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy largely determines its reform agenda, \nthe  Viet  Nam  development  reports  translate  this  agenda  into  policy  actions.  Because  a \nsustained reduction in poverty requires continued and balanced progress on a wide range of \npolicy reforms, the Government has an extensive reform agenda and the Viet Nam development \nreports specify numerous policy actions in many different areas.  \n \n13.  Some of these actions are included in the policy matrices for PRSCs. During the year \nbefore the World Bank is expected to approve a particular PRSC, the participating development \nagencies agree among themselves and with the Government on the initial policy matrix for the \nPRSC. At the start of the year in which the World Bank is to approve the PRSC, the agencies \nhold joint consultations with the Government on individual policy actions included in the initial \nmatrix. When the World Bank undertakes the appraisal and the negotiations for the PRSC \n(usually in May of the year when the PRSC is expected to be approved), the agencies and the \nGovernment agree on the final policy matrix for that PRSC. Some actions that were included in \nthe  initial  policy  matrix  are  modified  or  dropped  at  this  stage,  based  on  their  status  and \nlikelihood of being completed before the World Bank\u2019s executive board deliberates on the PRSC.  \n \n14.  Actions in all key reform areas are usually included in the policy matrices for PRSCs to \nhelp the Government make balanced progress in reforms across various areas and fully carry \nout its reform agenda. Therefore, the policy matrices for PRSCs tend to be broad in scope and \nto closely match the Government\u2019s reform agenda. This makes the PRSC process attractive to \nmany development agencies (focusing on different areas of policy reforms) and contributes to \nthe strong government ownership of the actions included in the policy matrices for PRSCs.  \n \n15.  At the same time, the good-practice principle of criticality in development policy lending \nguides the selection of policy actions within a particular reform area. According to this principle, \nonly those actions that are critical to the achievement of results should be made conditions for \ndisbursement.6 Therefore, the policy matrices for PRSCs include only those actions that the \nparticipating development agencies and the Government consider to be critical steps in the \nreform process in the area concerned, and for which the Government needs the combined \nsupport  of  many  development  agencies.  The  Government  follows  through  with  the  reform \nprocess on its own or with the support of development agencies under other projects. This \napproach helps keep the policy matrices for PRSCs manageable despite their broad scope. \nHowever, it also limits the continuity of actions included in the policy matrices for various PRSCs. \n \n16.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) joined the PRSC process in 2003 and has taken \npart in most PRSC activities since then. In 2004, ADB approved SIPRP I, a single-tranche \nstandard program loan of $6.4 million. SIPRP I provided parallel financing with the World Bank\u2019s \n                                                \n6  World Bank. 2005.

Socioeconomic Development Plan 2006\u20132010 \n17.  The Government adopted the Socioeconomic Development Plan (SEDP) 2006\u20132010 in \n2006. Unlike previous SEDPs, SEDP 2006\u20132010 was prepared in an open and participatory \nmanner  involving  extensive  consultations  with  civil  society,  businesses,  and  development \nagencies.  It  is  oriented  more  toward  attaining  development  outcomes  (including  poverty \nreduction) and less toward achieving production targets. One of its main targets is to reduce the \npoverty rate (based on MOLISA\u2019s methodology) from 20.2% in 2005 to 10%\u201311% in 2010. \nSEDP 2006\u20132010 also aspires to strengthen the foundations for environmentally sustainable \nand socially inclusive economic growth, and a continued reduction in poverty beyond 2010. It \nprovides for a broad range of policy reforms and a large number of investment projects aimed at \nachieving its targets and goals. The joint International Development Association\u2013International \nMonetary  Fund  staff  advisory  note  of  5 December 2006  on  Viet  Nam\u2019s  poverty  reduction \nstrategy concluded that SEDP 2006\u20132010 has the key features of a poverty reduction strategy \nand is likely to lead to economic growth and poverty reduction.9 \n \n18.  Since late 2006, the PRSC process has supported the policy reforms needed for the \nsuccessful  implementation  of  SEDP  2006\u20132010.  In  2007,  about  a  dozen  multilateral  and \nbilateral development agencies, including ADB, provided general budget support to Viet Nam \nwithin the framework of the PRSC process to help the Government keep these reforms on track \nin  2007.  ADB  approved  SIPRP  IV  (another  single-tranche  standard  program  loan  for  $15 \nmillion) for this purpose in October 2007.  \n                                                \n7  SIPRP I\u2013III are all rated as successful in the respective program completion reports (ADB. 2006.

Issues and Opportunities \n1.  Challenges in Poverty Reduction \n19.  Despite the tremendous strides Viet Nam has made in reducing poverty over the past \n15\u201320 years, much remains to be done. First, the absolute number of poor people is still large, \nalthough their share in the total population has dropped drastically. According to the household \nsurvey data, 13.5 million people lived in poverty and 5.7 million people suffered from hunger in \n2006. The poverty rate based on MOLISA's methodology suggests that 11.3 million people lived \nbelow the official poverty line in 2008. \n \n20.  Second, the incidence of poverty is still high in rural areas and among ethnic minorities, \nalthough it has been decreasing faster than in urban areas and among the ethnic majority. In \n2006, the poverty rate was 20.4% in rural areas (compared with 3.9% in urban areas) and \n52.2% among ethnic minorities (compared with 10.2% among the Kinh and Chinese majority) \n(footnote 1). Rural areas accounted for 73.3% of the total population but 93.6% of the poor. \nEthnic minorities made up 13.5% of the total population but 44.4% of the poor.10 \n \n21.  Third, the rural poor and poor ethnic minority people not only account for relatively large \nproportions of their respective population groups, but also have significantly lower average \nincomes than the urban poor and poor ethnic majority people, respectively. In 2006, the poverty \ngap was 4.9% in the rural areas and 15.4% among ethnic minorities, compared with 3.2% in the \nurban areas and 2.0% among the Kinh and Chinese majority (footnote 1). \n \n22.  Fourth,  the  incidence  of poverty  varies significantly  across regions. It  is  low  in  the \nSoutheast, Red River Delta, Mekong Delta, and South Central Coast, but high in the Northern \nMountains (especially the Northwest Mountains), North Central Coast, and Central Highlands. In \n2006,  the  poverty  rate  was  30.2%  in  the  Northern  Mountains  (49.0%  in  the  Northwest \nMountains), 29.1% in the North Central Coast, and 28.6% in the Central Highlands, compared \nwith 5.8% in the Southeast and 8.8% in the Red River Delta (footnote 1). \n \n23.  Fifth, the vulnerability of the population to poverty is rather high. The large difference \nbetween the proportion of the population living on less than $2.0 per day based on PPP (32.9% \nin 2007) and the share of those living on less than $1.0 per day based on PPP (4.0% in 2007) \nsuggests that the near-poor account for a substantial proportion of the population. A small \nexternal or internal shock and a moderate deterioration in the economic situation can push \nmany of these people into poverty. \n \n24.  Finally, some negative trends in poverty have emerged recently. The household survey \ndata show that urban poverty increased between 2004 and 2006. The poverty rate rose from \n3.6% in 2004 to 3.9% in 2006, while the food poverty rate increased from 0.8% to 1.2% \n(footnote 1). Anecdotal evidence suggests that high inflation and, in particular, the steep rise of \nfood prices pushed many low-income households, especially in urban areas, into poverty in \n2008. As economic activity slowed sharply, unemployment and underemployment increased \nand more households, particularly in rural areas, fell into poverty in the first several months of \n2009. Many people from rural areas who were employed in urban areas of Viet Nam or abroad \n                                                \n10 World Bank. 2008.

Some of them returned to \ntheir villages, even though they have few alternative sources of income there.11 \n2.  Opportunities Afforded by the Poverty Reduction Support Credit Process \n25.  To meet the remaining challenges of poverty reduction, Viet Nam needs, among other \nthings, to press ahead with the policy reforms that increase the efficiency of social protection, \nand foster environmentally sustainable and socially inclusive economic growth. These reforms \nwill help Viet Nam limit the adverse impact of the global economic crisis on growth, employment, \nand poverty and quickly resume rapid economic growth and poverty reduction.  \n \n26.  However, some of these reforms, such as restructuring state-owned enterprises (SOEs) \nand reforming the health care and education systems, are complex. Moreover, their costs to the \neconomy as a whole and to the state budget in particular are likely to exceed their benefits in \nthe short term. Therefore, they are likely to put a considerable burden on the state budget in the \nshort  term  and  result  in  net  losses  for  some  economic  actors  even  over  the  long  term. \nConsequently, potential losers are likely to resist some of these reforms.  \n \n27.  Strong support from development partners, through the PRSC process, can help the \nGovernment  carry  out  these  reforms.  In  2006,  under  the  auspices  of  the  Network  on \nDevelopment Evaluation of the Development Assistance Committee of the Organization for \nEconomic Co-operation and Development, several development agencies and governments \ncommissioned an evaluation study of partnership general budget support (PGBS) operations in \nseven developing countries, including Viet Nam. The study looked into the relevance, efficiency, \nand effectiveness of PGBS (involving several development agencies and the government). It \nfound that the PRSC process in Viet Nam is an efficient, effective, and sustainable way of \nsupporting national poverty reduction strategies. PGBS can significantly affect policies and \npolicy processes through financial empowerment, stronger incentives within government, and \nbetter coherence and coordination among international partners. In the countries covered by the \nstudy, PGBS has reinforced collaboration between governments and development agencies, \nand has improved harmonization of official development assistance. It has helped make public \nfinance  management  more  comprehensive  and  transparent,  increased  pro-poor  public \nexpenditures, and resulted in large savings to the government in transaction costs. The PRSC \nprocess in Viet Nam has had a strong positive impact on policy reforms. It is an example of \nsuccessful  government\u2013donor  collaboration,  of  learning  from  experience,  and  of  objectives \nmet.12  \n \n28.  Indeed, the PRSC process has been a driving force of policy reforms in Viet Nam in \nrecent years. The Government has used the involvement of a large number of development \nagencies (including ADB) in the process to overcome domestic resistance to policy reforms. To \n                                                \n11 Reliable statistical evidence on the impact on poverty of high inflation in 2008 and economic slowdown in the first \nhalf of 2009 is not available yet. The most recent Viet Nam Household Living Standards Survey was conducted in \n2008, and the data it has generated are being processed. \n12 The study also points out several shortcomings of the PRSC process in Viet Nam (some of which were fully or \npartly eliminated after the study was conducted). Among them are inadequate attention to cross-cutting issues, \nsuch as gender; weaknesses of the monitoring and evaluation framework; limited ex-post impact analysis; and the \nlarge number of the participating development agencies, which makes the coordination of the process more difficult \nand hinders its cohesion (International Development Department and Associates. 2006. Evaluation of General \nBudget Support: Synthesis Report. Birmingham: University of Birmingham.  \nhttp://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/25/43/37426676.pdf) \n ", "8 \ndeal  with  such  resistance,  government  agencies  advocating  certain  reforms  have  often \nproposed the inclusion of these measures in the policy matrices for the PRSCs.  \n \n29.  According to the World Bank\u2019s report on the implementation and results of PRSCs 1\u20135, \nthe first phase of the PRSC process in Viet Nam (which supported the implementation of \nCPRGS 2002\u20132006) contributed to the significant achievements by the country in its transition \nto a market economy, social inclusion, and the building of modern governance. The PRSC \nprocess had a direct influence on the adoption of policy actions that were conducive to faster \neconomic growth and poverty reduction, and helped spread market mechanisms, create wage \nemployment, and improve the delivery of public services. The annual PRSC cycle with tight \ndeadlines increased incentives to complete key policy actions on time. In addition, the PRSC \nprocess helped the Government strengthen its capacity to conduct cross-sector policy dialogue \nand deliver results on time. Consultations with a large number of development agencies within \nthe framework of the PRSC process showed the Government the benefits of an open dialogue \non key issues, and made it more receptive to sharing its draft documents at an early stage and \neliciting feedback from the stakeholders.13 \n \n30.  Stakeholder consultations that were held in 2006 as part of an independent evaluation of \nthe first phase of the PRSC process found that the process was beneficial to policy reforms in \nViet Nam. Both the Government and the participating development agencies emphasized that \nthe policy dialogue within the framework of the PRSC process was a major benefit of the \nprocess. The Government valued the ideas offered by the development agencies on the design \nand  implementation  of  policy  reforms,  while  the  development  agencies  gained  a  broader \nunderstanding of the direction of the reform process and government thinking. Other PRSC \nbenefits stemmed not only from improving the quality of policies, but also from locking in the \nGovernment\u2019s commitment to specific reforms and speeding up their implementation.14 \nIV.  SUPPORT FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE POVERTY REDUCTION \nPROGRAM V \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n31.  ADB approved SIPRP V, a program cluster consisting of three subprograms, and a \nsingle-tranche loan (about $25 million) for its subprogram 1 in December 2008.15 The intended \nimpact of SIPRP V is a continued reduction in poverty in Viet Nam in 2008\u20132010 and beyond. \nIts expected outcome is the successful implementation of the Government\u2019s SEDP 2006\u20132010, \nwhich  will  not  only reduce  poverty  in  2006\u20132010,  but  also  enhance  Viet  Nam's  economic \ncompetitiveness and strengthen the foundations for inclusive and sustainable growth and a \ncontinued reduction in poverty beyond 2010. To achieve this outcome, SIPRP V is to help the \nGovernment carry out policy reforms that are needed for the successful implementation of \nSEDP 2006\u20132010. Specifically, SIPRP V is to support\u2014through the PRSC process\u2014policy \nactions that are critical steps in carrying out the reforms and are important to ADB\u2019s operations \nin Viet Nam. \n                                                \n13 World Bank. 2007.

Manila. \n ", "  9 \n \n32.  The policy actions supported by SIPRP V fall into the following four broad reform areas: \n \n(i)  Business  development.  Improving  financial  management  and  corporate \ngovernance of SOEs, developing the financial and private sectors, and improving \nthe quality of infrastructure services. \n(ii)  Social inclusion. Improving the quality of health care and education, and access \nto these services.  \n(iii)  Natural  resource  management.  Strengthening  the  management  of  water \nresources and the protection of the environment.  \n(iv)  Governance.  Improving  planning  processes,  strengthening  public  financial \nmanagement and pubic administration, and reducing corruption.16  \n \n33.  These  reforms closely  match  the  priorities  of ADB's  country  strategy  and  program, \n2007\u20132010  for  Viet  Nam.  The  primary  focus  of  the  country  strategy  and  program  is  on \npromoting business-led, pro-poor economic growth by developing infrastructure, improving the \nbusiness environment, strengthening financial and related market institutions, and building up \nhuman capital. The country strategy and program also aims to foster social inclusiveness, \nenhance management of the environment, and improve governance.17  \nB.  Important Features \n34.  SIPRP V follows the program-based approach and is, in some respects, a continuation \nof SIPRPs I\u2013IV. It is to provide parallel financing with the World Bank\u2019s PRSCs within the \nframework of the PRSC process. Like SIPRP IV, it is intended to help the Government carry out \npolicy reforms needed for the successful implementation of SEDP 2006\u20132010.  \n \n35.  Unlike SIPRPs I\u2013IV, SIPRP V takes the program cluster approach. It consists of three \nchronologically ordered subprograms. Subprogram 1 provided parallel financing with PRSC 7, \nsubprogram 2 is to provide parallel financing with PRSC 8, and subprogram 3 is to provide \nparallel financing with PRSC 9. The outputs, outcome, impact, and performance indicators and \ntargets of SIPRP V are the same for all its subprograms. \n \n36.  Individual  subprograms  of  SIPRP  V  can  only  cover  actions  included  in  the  policy \nmatrices of the corresponding PRSCs. Moreover, they are to focus on those actions in the \npolicy matrices for PRSCs 7\u20139 that complement actions supported by ADB\u2019s other program \nloans to Viet Nam or are otherwise important to ADB\u2019s operations in the country.  \n \n37.  Nevertheless, SIPRP V has a broad scope because the policy matrices for PRSCs \ninclude actions in many reform areas. Further, ADB is active in many sectors in Viet Nam, and \npolicy reforms in these sectors often have significant implications for its operations. At the same \ntime,  only  limited  continuity  can  be  expected  in  the  policy  actions  supported  by  various \nsubprograms of SIPRP V because of the limited continuity in the policy matrices for different \nPRSCs.  \n \n38.  SIPRP V is a general intervention aiming to help Viet Nam reduce poverty, but its impact \non poverty will largely be indirect. The policy reforms supported by SIPRP V will improve \n                                                \n16 Figure A3.1 in Appendix 3 shows graphically how the policy reforms supported by SIPRP V will contribute to its \noutcome. \n17 ADB. 2006. Country Strategy and Program (2007\u20132010): Viet Nam. Manila. \n ", "10 \ngovernance, develop businesses, and stimulate economic growth. Business development and \neconomic growth will create news jobs, raise incomes, and make more resources available for \nsocial protection. Poor and vulnerable people in both rural and urban areas, ethnic minorities, \nand poor regions will benefit from more jobs, higher incomes, and increased availability of \nresources for social protection. The reforms supported by SIPRP V will also make economic \ngrowth more socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable by improving the quality of \nhealth care and education and access to these services, and by strengthening the management \nof  natural  resources.  Hence,  SIPRP  V  complements  ADB's  targeted  poverty-reducing \ninterventions in Viet Nam, which seek to reduce poverty in a particular region within the country \nor among ethnic minorities.  \nC.  Subprogram 1 and Lessons \n39.  Subprogram 1 of SIPRP V covered 12 of 35 actions included in the policy matrix for \nPRSC 7. All of these actions were completed before ADB approved the loan for the subprogram. \nTherefore, loan effectiveness was the only condition for loan disbursement. The loan became \neffective in April 2009 and was disbursed in May 2009. \n \n40.  Two notable lessons emerged from the formulation and implementation of subprogram \n1.  First, the  policy  reform  process slows  when  Viet  Nam faces macroeconomic  difficulties \nbecause the Government focuses its efforts on overcoming these difficulties and cannot devote \nenough staff resources to reforms. The reform process slowed in the first half of 2008, when \ninflation and the trade deficit surged, and the Government's top policy priority became stabilizing \nthe macroeconomic situation. Second, a fall in stock prices causes delays in equitization of \nSOEs  and  state-owned  commercial  banks  (SOCBs). While  recognizing  that  equitization  of \nSOEs is essential to improving their corporate governance and efficiency, the Government does \nnot  want  to  sell  their  shares  when  stock  prices  are  low.  These  lessons  were  taken  into \nconsideration when the proposed subprogram was formulated (paras. 52 and 54). \nD.  Progress towards Performance Targets \n41.  Despite the macroeconomic turbulence and the slowdown in economic growth, Viet Nam \nmade good overall progress towards the performance targets of SIPRP V in 2008. Due mainly \nto the Government's targeted interventions, the poverty rate based on MOLISA's methodology \nfell from 14.7% in 2007 to an estimated 13.1% in 2008 (Appendix 4). Hence, Viet Nam is on \ntrack to reduce the poverty rate to 10%\u201311% by 2010, which is one of the main targets of SEDP \n2006\u20132010 and one of the two outcome targets of SIPRP V.  \n \n42.  At the  same  time,  the progress  towards  the  other  outcome  target  of SIPRP  V\u2014to \nincrease Viet Nam's Global Competitiveness Index score from 4.04 in 2007\u20132008 to 4.60 in \n2010\u20132011\u2014was relatively slow. The score increased to 4.10 in 2008\u20132009. Increases in the \nsubscores for goods market efficiency, financial markets sophistication, infrastructure, health, \neducation, institutions, and innovation were partly offset by a sharp decrease in the subscore for \nmacroeconomic stability.  \n \n43.  As for the SIPRP V output targets pertaining to business development, Viet Nam has \nachieved the target related to the share of FDI in total investment, and is on track to attain the \ntarget concerning the share of nonperforming loans (NPLs) in the loan portfolio of commercial \nbanks (often referred to as the NPL ratio). Despite tight global financial conditions, FDI inflows \nto Viet Nam surged in 2008. As a result, the share of FDI in total investment jumped from 16.0% \n ", "  11 \nin 2007 to 29.8% in 2008, compared with the SIPRP V target of 20% in 2010. FDI inflows are \nlikely to be smaller in 2009 than in 2008 because of the global economic crisis and heightened \nrisk aversion of foreign investors. However, they are expected to rebound in 2010, as the global \nfinancial conditions and investor sentiment improve. Consequently, the share of FDI in total \ninvestment is likely to be higher than 20% in 2010.  \n \n44.  The SIPRP V output target for the NPL ratio is that the ratio will not exceed 5% by 2010. \nThe ratio increased from 1.5% at the end of 2007 to 2.1% at the end of 2008 because of the \ndrop in stock prices, cooling of the real estate market, and slowdown in growth. The ratio is \nlikely  to  increase  further  in  2009  because  of  the  anticipated  further  slowdown  of  growth. \nHowever, it is unlikely to exceed 5% by 2010 in part because growth is expected to rebound in \n2010. \n \n45.  Viet Nam completed the equitization of one SOCB\u2014Vietcombank\u2014in 2008, as part of \nan action included in the policy matrix of PRSC 7 and covered by subprogram 1 of SIPRP V. \nFurthermore,  the  Government  approved  equitization  plans  for  two  more  SOCBs\u2014Mekong \nHousing Bank and Vietinbank\u2014in 2008. Vietinbank had an initial public offering in December \n2008  and  the  first  general  meeting  of  shareholders  in  June  2009.  As  with  Vietcombank, \nVietinbank's legal status has been changed from a fully state-owned company into a partially \nstate-owned joint-stock company. The initial public offering of Mekong Housing Bank has been \ndelayed because of unfavorable market conditions. The equitization of many SOEs has been \ndelayed for the same reason. Accordingly, the progress towards the SIPRP V output targets \npertaining to the number of SOCBs and the share of the private sector in total investment was \nslow in 2008 and the first half of 2009.  \n \n46.  Viet Nam has achieved the social inclusion target related to the mortality rate for children \nunder 5 years old. It is on track to attain the targets concerning the proportion of poor and ethnic \nminority people with health insurance, the number of provinces with universal completed lower \nsecondary education, and the proportion of trained workers. However, the maternal mortality \nrate decreased only slightly and the net primary education enrollment rate remained stagnant \nbetween 2007 and 2008.   \n \n47.  Viet  Nam  has  achieved  the  natural  resource  management  target  concerning  the \nproportion of the rural population with access to clean water, and is on track to attain the targets \nrelating to the proportion of urban wastes that are collected. However, progress towards the \ntarget pertaining to the proportion of urban households with access to clean water was slow in \n2008, and the proportion of hospital waste that was treated decreased between 2007 and 2008.      \n \n48.  Little progress was made towards the governance target in 2008. The non-weighted \naverage  score  of  the  World  Bank's  governance  indicators  for  government  effectiveness, \nregulatory quality, rule of law, and control of corruption in Viet Nam was essentially unchanged \nbetween 2007 and 2008. Higher scores for government effectiveness, rule of law, and control of \ncorruption were offset by a lower score for regulatory quality.  \nV.  THE PROPOSED SUBPROGRAM \nA.  Policy Framework and Actions \n49.  A combined list of tentative actions under subprograms 2 and 3 was included in the \ndesign  and  monitoring  framework  and  the  policy  matrix  of  SIPRP  V  in  the  report  and \n ", "12 \nrecommendation of the President on the program cluster and its subprogram 1. These actions \nwere drawn from the tentative list of policy actions for PRSCs 8\u201310. The report stated that, after \nthe development agencies participating in the PRSC process and the Government agreed on \nthe final policy matrix for PRSC 8, the actions to be covered by subprogram 2 of SIPRP V would \nbe separated from those to be covered by subprogram 3. If necessary, the actions under \nsubprogram 2 would be adjusted to make them fully consistent with the policy matrix for PRSC \n8.18 \n \n50.  In late 2008, the development agencies participating in the PRSC process (including \nADB) and the Government agreed on the initial policy matrix for PRSC 8.  The policy actions \nincluded in that matrix can be divided into the following three categories: \n \n(i)  actions that were included in the original policy matrix of SIPRP V as tentative \nactions under subprograms 2 and 3; \n(ii)  actions that were not in the original policy matrix of SIPRP V but within ADB's \nfocus areas in Viet Nam; and \n(iii)  actions that were outside ADB's focus areas in Viet Nam.  \n \n51.  Between  December  2008  and  May  2009,  the  development  agencies  and  the \nGovernment held several rounds of consultations on the actions included in the initial policy \nmatrix for PRSC 8. ADB staff took part in the consultations on the actions in the first two of the \nthree categories.  \n \n52.  In May 2009, the development agencies and the Government agreed on the final policy \nmatrix for PRSC 8. Some of the actions included in the initial matrix were modified or dropped in \nview of their status and likelihood of being completed before the World Bank's Executive Board \nconsidered PRSC 8 in June 2009. The final matrix includes seven actions in the first category \nand 11 actions in the second category.19 It is arguably less ambitious than the policy matrices of \nprevious PRSCs. The reason is that, in the second half of 2008 and the first half of 2009, the \nGovernment focused on countering the adverse impacts of the global economic crisis on Viet \nNam and could not devote enough staff resources to medium-term policy reforms. Therefore, \ndevelopment agencies anticipated the overall process of policy reforms to be relatively slow in \n2009. \n \n53.  The proposed subprogram covers all seven actions in the first category and five of the \n11 actions in the second category in the final policy matrix of PRSC 8. The actions in the second \ncategory have been selected in consultation with the Government and various units within ADB, \ntaking into account how much progress the Government made in carrying them out and how \nimportant they are to ADB's operations in Viet Nam. The purpose is to recognize the substantive \nreforms that the Government implemented between June 2008 and May 2009 in consultation \nwith ADB and other development agencies participating in the PRSC process. These reforms \nare within ADB's focus areas in Viet Nam, were not covered by subprogram 1 of SIPRP V, and \nare not supported by ADB's other program loans to Viet Nam.  \n \n54.  The subprogram does not include a policy action on equitization of SOCBs or SOEs, \nalthough Viet Nam made slow progress towards the SIPRP V targets on the equitization of \n                                                \n18 ADB. 2008. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on the Proposed Program \nCluster and Loan for Subprogram 1 to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Support for the Implementation of \nthe Poverty Reduction Program V. Manila (p. 21). \n19 A full list of actions included in the final policy matrix of PRSC 8 is in Appendix 5. \n \n ", "  13 \nSOCBs and the share of the domestic private sector in total investment in 2008. The reason is \nthat stock prices fell sharply in 2008 and are expected to stay low in 2009. The Government \ndoes not want to sell shares of SOCBs and SOEs when stock prices are down. It wants to focus \non restructuring of SOEs with the aim of improving their efficiency and selling their shares at \nhigher prices when market conditions improve. Accordingly, the final policy matrix for PRSC 8 \nincludes an action on financial management of SOEs but no action on equitization of SOCBs or \nSOEs. \n \n55.  Most of the tentative actions under subprograms 2 and 3 in the original policy matrix of \nSIPRP V that have not been included in the policy matrix of PRSC 8 and are therefore not \ncovered  by  subprogram  2  of  SIPRP  V  have  been  retained  as  tentative  actions  under  its \nsubprogram 3. In the second half of 2008 and the first half of 2009, the Government made some \nprogress in carrying out several of these actions (e.g., transferring state ownership rights in \nSOEs to the State Capital Investment Corporation, equitizing SOCBs, and certifying internal \ncredit  rating  systems  of  commercial  banks).  However,  the  progress  was  not  sufficient  to \nconsider  the  actions  completed.  The  Government  and  development  agencies  are  likely  to \ncontinue dialogue on these actions in conjunction with PRSC 9. Therefore, they have been \nretained as tentative actions under subprogram 3 of SIPRP V. Figure A3.2 in Appendix 3 is the \nupdated policy matrix of SIPRP V. \n \n56.  Some of the tentative actions under subprograms 2 and 3 in the original policy matrix of \nSIPRP V have been dropped or replaced with other actions in the same reform area. Notably, \nthe  actions  concerning  the  establishment  of  a  national  business  registry  and  the  legal \nframework for the development of small and medium-sized enterprises have been dropped. The \nGovernment made some progress in carrying out these actions in the second half of 2008 and \nthe first half of 2009, but it was not sufficient to regard the actions as completed. They will be \ncovered by the Small and Medium Enterprise Development Program Loan II (included in ADB's \n2009 indicative pipeline for Viet Nam). Table A3.1 in Appendix 3 shows the status of each \ntentative action under subprograms 2 and 3 in the original policy matrix of SIPRP V and \nindicates why some of them have been dropped or replaced.  \n \n57.  The changes in the policy matrix of SIPRP V are not expected to have a major impact on \nits outcome. They slightly increase the likelihood that the SIPRP V output targets for natural \nresource management and governance will be achieved. At the same time, they slightly reduce \nthe chances that the SIPRP V output targets related to the number of SOCBs and health will be \nattained. In terms of overall business development, the measures aimed at restructuring SOEs \nwill compensate for the relatively slow progress in their equitization.  \n \n58.  All actions covered by the proposed subprogram have been completed, although two of \nthem\u2014action 1.2 (prepare a revised law on the central bank focusing its mandate on, and \nenhancing its autonomy in regard to, monetary policy and financial sector stability) and action \n4.2 (formulate a public debt management law consolidating the management of domestic and \nexternal  debt)\u2014have  not  been  carried  out  exactly  as  envisaged.  The  Government's \nDevelopment Policy Letter is in Appendix 6.  \n1.  Business Development \n59.  Action 1.1: Strengthen financial management of SOEs, limiting their investments \nin other entities, defining the level of such investments.20 Many SOEs invested extensively \n                                                \n20 The action is one of the tentative actions under subprograms 2 and 3 in the original policy matrix of SIPRP V. \n ", "14 \nin non-core businesses, including financial and real estate companies, in recent years. Their \naggressive  investment  expansion  contributed  to  the  stock  market  bubble  in  2007  and  the \nmacroeconomic turbulence in 2008. Close links between some SOEs and commercial banks \ncreated the risk that the banks' lending decisions would not be guided solely by commercial \nconsiderations. As a result, the allocation of credit could be distorted, the quality of banks' loan \nportfolio could worsen, and the vulnerability of the banking system could increase.  \n \n60.  To  address  these  issues,  the  Government  has  adopted\u2014through  Decree  No. \n09/2009/ND-CP dated 5 February 2009\u2014a new regulation on financial management of SOEs. \nThe regulation limits SOEs' investments in non-core businesses, especially in the financial \nsector. It stipulates that an SOE must invest at least 70% of its capital and borrowed funds in \ncore businesses. Total investments of an SOE in other companies should not exceed its charter \ncapital.  An  SOE  can  only  invest  in  one  company  operating  in  the  banking,  insurance,  or \nsecurities subsectors, and its investment cannot exceed 20% of that company's charter capital. \nIf an SOE and its subsidiary invest in the same company, their combined investment cannot \nexceed  30%  of  that  company's  charter  capital.  An  SOE  is  prohibited  from  investing  in  a \ncompany whose senior staff member or major shareholder is related to a senior staff member of \nthe SOE.   \n \n61.  This action under subprogram 2 builds on action 1.1 under subprogram 1 (assess the \nscope and nature of lending and other transactions among affiliated parties within economic \ngroups and general corporations). It provides an impetus to restructure SOEs and complements \nthe reforms that the SOE Reform and Corporate Governance Facility, a program loan in ADB\u2019s \n2009 indicative pipeline for Viet Nam, is intended to support.  \n \n62.  Action 1.2: Prepare a revised law on the central bank focusing its mandate on, and \nenhancing  its  autonomy  in  regard  to,  monetary  policy  and  financial  sector  stability \n(footnote 20). The current Law on the State Bank of Viet Nam (SBV), the country's central bank, \nassigns the SBV numerous tasks, including those not usually performed by a central bank (such \nas  regulating  the  gold  market).  At  the  same  time,  it  gives  the  SBV  limited  autonomy  in \nformulating monetary policy. The law assigns an important role in monetary policy formulation to \nthe Advisory Board on National Monetary Policy, chaired by one of the deputy prime ministers. \nFurthermore, the law sets multiple (potentially conflicting) goals for monetary policy without \nprioritization. These goals include stabilizing the value of the currency, controlling inflation, \nfacilitating socioeconomic development, ensuring national defense and security, and improving \nliving standards.   \n \n63.  In consultation with development agencies, the Government is preparing a revised law \non  the  SBV.  The  latest  draft  of  the  law  incorporates  many  of  the  comments  made  by \ndevelopment  agencies  on  its  earlier  draft.  It  makes  the  SBV's  mandate  more  focused  on \nmonetary  policy  and  financial  sector  stability,  and  increases  its  autonomy  in  formulating \nmonetary policy. In particular, the draft law does not provide for the Advisory Board on the \nNational Monetary Policy. Instead, it gives the SBV governor the power to establish a committee \non monetary policy within the SBV. It also sets one objective for monetary policy\u2014ensuring the \nstability of the value of the currency, which encompasses controlling inflation and preventing \nsharp fluctuations of the exchange rate. However, for a number of country-specific reasons, the \nGovernment has decided that the National Assembly (parliament) should retain the authority to \napprove  inflation  targets  (proposed  by  the  SBV),  and  the  SBV  governor  should  continue \nreporting to the Prime Minister rather than directly to the National Assembly. The draft law is \nexpected to be presented to the National Assembly for discussion in the fourth quarter of 2009 \nand for approval in the second quarter of 2010. \n ", "  15 \n \n64.  Action  1.2  under  the  proposed  subprogram  will  help  strengthen  monetary  policy \nmanagement,  control  inflation,  and  enhance  financial  sector  stability.  It  complements \nimprovements  in  the  monetary  policy  framework  that  the  technical  assistance  (TA)  for \nstrengthening monetary policy management (included in the indicative pipeline for 2010) is \nintended to bring about. It also complements policy actions and reforms under subprogram 1 of \nthe Third Financial Sector Program Loan (approved in November 2007)21 and activities of the \nTA for Support for Developing Capital Markets and Building Capacity in the Financial Sector \n(approved in June 2008).22 \n \n65.  Action 1.3: Make commercial-scale infringements of patents, trademark rights, \nand rights of design a crime.23 Although Viet Nam has a Law on Intellectual Property Rights, \nthe protection of intellectual property rights is weak, which stifles innovation and business \ndevelopment.  Companies  that  participated  in  the  business  environment  sentiment  survey \nconducted by the Vietnam Business Forum in October 2008 ranked the weak protection of \nintellectual property rights as the second-worst aspect of the business environment in Viet Nam \nafter infrastructure.24  \n \n66.  One reason violations of intellectual property rights are common in Viet Nam is that such \nviolations are not considered a crime in the country's Criminal Code. To rectify this situation, the \nGovernment has prepared\u2014in consultations with development agencies\u2014amendments to the \nCriminal Code that make commercial-scale infringement of patents, trademark rights, and rights \nof design a crime. The amendments were approved by the National Assembly in June 2009 and \nwill become effective on 1 January 2010. \n \n67.  This  action  under  the  proposed  subprogram  complements  policy  actions  that  are \nsupported by subprogram 2 of the Small and Medium Enterprise Development Program Loan \n(approved  in  December  2006)25 as  well  as  actions that the  Small  and Medium  Enterprise \nDevelopment Program Loan II (included in the indicative pipeline for 2009) is intended to \nsupport. It will contribute to business development and the successful implementation of SEDP \n2006\u20132010 by promoting private sector development. \n \n68.  Action  1.4:  Adopt  a  pricing  system  for  electricity  from  renewable  energy  and \nprovide incentives for government procurement of energy-efficient equipment (footnote \n20). To meet rapidly growing demand for electricity while protecting the environment, Viet Nam \nneeds to increase power generation from renewable energy and stimulate the production of \nenergy-efficient machinery and equipment. However, the cost of generating electricity from \nrenewable energy is often higher than the cost of generating it from non-renewable resources \n(such as coal and gas). Therefore, prices for electricity generated from renewable energy must \nbe higher than those for electricity generated from non-renewable resources to make power \ngeneration from renewable energy financially viable.  \n                                                \n21 ADB. 2008.

Manila. \n ", "16 \n \n69.  In  July  2008,  the  Ministry  of  Industry  and  Trade  approved\u2014through  Decision  No. \n18/2008/QD-BCT\u2014the  Regulations  on  Avoided  Cost  and  Standardized  Power  Purchase \nAgreement for Small Power Producers of Renewable Energy. The regulations stipulate that the \nwholsale price of electricity from renewable energy should be based on the weighted average \ncost of electricity produced by combined-cycle gas turbines, which are the most costly thermal \nunits in Viet Nam's electricity supply system. This pricing system, which became effective on 1 \nJanuary 2009, has made the production of electricity from renewable energy commercially more \nattractive. It has significantly improved the chances that ADB's Renewable Energy Development \nand Network Expansion and Rehabilitation for Remote Communes Sector Project (approved in \nMarch 2009)26 will be successful.  \n \n70.  In March 2009, the Government decided to take additional measures aimed at ensuring \nthe full and timely implementation of the national program on energy efficiency (adopted in \n2008). One of these measures is to provide incentives for government procurement of energy-\nefficient  equipment  (e.g.,  by  providing  government  agencies  with  additional  funds  for \nprocurement of energy-efficient equipment and allowing them to retain savings on electricity bills \narising from the use of such equipment).  \n \n71.  Action 1.4 under the proposed subprogram will provide an impetus to develop renewable \nenergy and use energy-efficient equipment in Viet Nam. In so doing, it will help improve the \nquality of infrastructure, protect the environment, and help reduce poverty indirectly by fostering \nenvironmentally sustainable economic growth.  \n \n72.  The action will also contribute to poverty reduction directly. Some of the areas with high \nincidence of poverty (e.g., mountainous areas inhabited by ethnic minorities) have significant \nuntapped renewable energy resources. The new pricing system for electricity from renewable \nenergy will help expand the production of such electricity in these areas. Producers of electricity \nfrom renewable energy will be able to compensate for the relatively high cost of production and \nthe low purchasing power of the local population by supplying surplus electricity to the national \ngrid at higher prices. The expansion of electricity production will improve remote communes' \naccess to  electricity, foster  business  development,  create  jobs,  raise  living  standards,  and \nreduce poverty in these communes.27 \n2.  Social Inclusion \n73.  Action 2.1: Formulate an education development strategy for the period up to 2020, \nfocusing on the equity of learning outcomes and the relevance of contents (footnote 20). \nAlthough Viet Nam's education sector improved substantially in the last 10\u201315 years, many \nissues remain. In particular, the primary education enrollment rate remained stagnant between \n2007 and 2008 (Appendix 4). Furthermore, learning outcomes and completion rates in primary \neducation differ significantly among various groups of children. Children from poor households \ntend to do less well than children from non-poor households; children in remote areas tend to do \nless well than children in other areas; and ethnic minority children tend to do less well than \nethnic majority children. The completion rates for children from the poorest income quintile and \nethnic minority children are about 20 percentage points lower than those for children from the \n                                                \n26 ADB. 2009.

To address these issues in a holistic manner, the Government has prepared\u2014through \nextensive consultations within the Government, as well as with the civil society, development \nagencies, and other stakeholders\u2014an education development strategy for the period up to \n2020. Unlike previous education strategies, which focused on certain levels of education, the \nnew strategy takes a comprehensive approach to education development. It covers all levels of \neducation from early childhood to higher education, and attaches particular importance to the \nequity of leaning outcomes and the relevance of contents. It is expected to be adopted together \nwith SEDP 2011\u20132020 in 2010.  \n \n75.  The  strategy  will  provide  a  medium-term framework for the  Secondary  Education \nSector Development Program (included in the indicative pipeline for 2009) and the Higher \nEducation  Sector  Development  Program  (included  in  the  indicative  pipeline  for  2010). \nUltimately, it will help improve access to and the quality of education, enhance Viet Nam's \ncompetitiveness, eliminate the remaining gender disparities in education, and foster socially \ninclusive economic growth. \n3.  Natural Resource Management \n76.  Action  3.1:  Issue  regulations  to  ensure  financial  sustainability  of  irrigation \nservices and provide financial relief for poor farmers (footnote 23). The incidence of poverty \namong farmers, especially rice-growing farmers, is significantly higher than among non-farmers. \nThe household survey data show that the poverty rate was 20.4% among farmers and 23.4% \namong rice-growing farmers in 2006, compared with 3.8% for the urban population and 5.0% for \nnon-farmers living in the rural areas.29 Because of their low incomes, many poor farmers are \nunable to pay for the water they use in crop production.   \n \n77.  In October 2007, the Government issued Decree No. 154/2007/ND-CP, which called for \nthe abolition of irrigation service fees with the aim of providing financial relief to poor farmers. \nHowever,  the  irrigation  service  fee  waiver  envisaged  in  the  decree  was  poorly  targeted. \nFurthermore, the decree raised concerns about the financial viability of irrigation services, the \nsustainability  of  investment  in  irrigation  infrastructure,  and  the  lack  of  incentives  for  water \nconservation.  \n \n78.  To address these concerns, the Government issued Decree No. 115/2008/ND-CP dated \n14  November  2008,  which  clarifies  the  application  of  the  irrigation  service  fee  waver  and \nassigns responsibilities for financing operation and maintenance of irrigation infrastructure. The \ndecree stipulates that the irrigation service fee waiver applies only to services provided by \nirrigation management companies (which are SOEs) and only to water used for agricultural \n                                                \n28 World Bank. 2009.

The decree also requires the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and local \ngovernments  to  provide  adequate  financial  support  from  the  central  and  local  budgets  to \nirrigation management companies to enable them to properly operate and maintain irrigation \ninfrastructure. The MOF issued Circular No. 36/2009/TT-BTC dated 26 February 2009 on the \nimplementation of the decree and increased the budget allocation for irrigation subsidies from \nD1.0 trillion in 2008 to D3.5 trillion in 2009.  \n \n79.  Action 3.1 under subprogram 2 addresses an important policy issue affecting ADB's \nseveral ongoing and planned projects in Viet Nam, including the Second Red River Basin \nSector Project (approved in October 2001),31 Phuoc Hoa Water Resources Project (approved in \nNovember 2003),32 Central Region Water Resources Project (approved in November 2005,)33 \nand  the  Strengthening  Water  Management  and  Irrigation  Systems  Rehabilitation  Project \n(included  in  the  2010  indicative  pipeline  for  lending  products).  It  will  contribute  to  poverty \nreduction directly by providing financial relief to poor farmers and indirectly by improving the \nmanagement of water resources and fostering environmentally sustainable economic growth. \nTentative action 3.1 under subprogram 3 (issue guidelines for efficient use of water resources to \naccompany the irrigation service fee waiver policy) will build on action 3.1 under subprogram 2 \nto address the issue of inadequate incentives for water conservation, another important policy \nissue affecting ADB's operations in Viet Nam.  \n \n80.  Action 3.2: Approve a national targeted program for adapting to climate change \nand  allocate  institutional  responsibilities  for  its  implementation (footnote 20). Climate \nchange is expected to have significant adverse impacts on Viet Nam. A study on potential \nconsequences of rising sea levels resulting from climate change for 84 developing countries \nfound that Viet Nam is one of the five countries that would be most severely affected.34 A sea \nlevel rise of 1 meter would affect more than 5% of Viet Nam's land area and almost 11% of its \npopulation. An analysis of the potential impact of climate change on human development in Viet \nNam concluded that climate  change  is  \"a  very  real threat  to  Viet  Nam's  continued  socio-\neconomic development.\"35  \n \n81.  To meet  the  challenges  posed  by  climate change,  the  Government has  adopted\u2014\nthrough  Decision  No.  158/2008/QD-TTg  dated  2  December  2008\u2014the  National  Targeted \nProgram  for  Responding  to  the  Climate  Change.  The  objectives  of  the  program  include \nassessing  the  impacts  of  climate  change  on  specific  sectors  and  localities  in  Viet  Nam; \nincreasing public awareness of the challenges posed by climate change; and developing and \nimplementing national, sector-specific, and local action plans to respond to climate change. \n                                                \n30 Farmers are still to pay fees for irrigation services provided by water user associations, for water provided by \nirrigation management companies and used for non-agricultural purposes, and for water provided by irrigation \nmanagement companies for agricultural purposes beyond the limits set by the Government.   \n31 ADB. 2001.

A  national  steering  committee  for  the \nimplementation of the program, chaired by the Prime Minister, has been set up.  \n \n82.  The implementation of the program is underway. The TA projects for Assessing Impacts \nof  the  Climate  Change  on  the  Mekong  Delta  and  for  the  Implementation  of  the  National \nTargeted Program for Responding to the Climate Change (included in the indicative pipeline for \n2009) are intended to help the Government implement the Program.   \n \n83.  Action 3.3: Enhance treatment of medical waste discharged by hospitals at both \ncentral and local levels (footnote 23). The proportion of hospital wastes that were treated \ndeclined between 2007 and 2008. Therefore, the treatment of hospital wastes was one of the \nsubjects  covered  during  the  consultations  between  the  Government  and  the  development \nagencies on the policy matrix for PRSC 8.    \n \n84.  In October 2008, the Ministry of Health issued Directive No. 7164/BYT-KCB, instructing \nall hospitals to set up a system for treatment of medical wastes. In January 2009, a steering \ncommittee on the treatment of medical wastes, chaired by minister of health, was established. \nThe Ministry of Health is now preparing an action plan for improving the treatment of hospital \nwastes, including solid and liquid wastes. The action plan will cover public and private hospitals. \n \n85.  This action under the proposed subprogram complements the Health Care in the South \nCentral  Coast  Region  Project  (approved  in  October  2008),  which  aims  to  improve  health \nfacilities and hospital waste management in the south central coast region of Viet Nam.36 It will \nhelp protect the environment and eliminate the risk to public safety posed by medical wastes.   \n4.  Governance \n86.  Action 4.1: Conduct a midterm review of SEDP 2006\u20132010 and strengthen the \nresults-based  approach  in  the  monitoring  and  evaluation  framework  for  planning \n(footnote 23). As part of the modernization of planning processes in Viet Nam, the Government \nadopted a results-based monitoring and evaluation framework for SEDP 2006\u20132010 in 2007.37 \nADB assisted the Government in developing the framework through the TA for Results-Based \nMonitoring of Poverty Reduction and Growth (approved in July 2005).38 Although SEDP 2006\u2013\n2010 calls for improvements in many aspects of governance, only a few indicators and targets \nfor monitoring and evaluating progress in this area were included in the framework because of \nthe lack of suitable indicators. \n \n87.  In 2008, the Government prepared a midterm review of SEDP 2006\u20132010, using the \nresults-based monitoring and evaluation framework adopted in 2007. Unlike the Government's \nprevious reports on the implementation of SEDPs, the midterm review of SEDP 2006\u20132010 \nfocused on progress towards development outcomes rather than production targets. The review \nwas  presented  to  the  National  Assembly  in  October  2008  and  to  the  Consultative  Group \nMeeting for Viet Nam in December 2008. It was useful in assessing the progress towards \nperformance targets of SIPRP V (which are aligned with those of SEDP 2006\u20132010) and \n                                                \n36 ADB. 2008.

Manila. \n ", "20 \npreparing the midterm review of ADB's country strategy and program (2007\u20132010) for Viet Nam \n(which has a result-based monitoring and evaluation framework). \n \n88.  Furthermore, the Government conducted a pilot survey on governance in conjunction \nwith the Viet Nam household living standards survey 2008. The survey results, which are being \nanalyzed, will be used in developing governance indicators for monitoring and evaluation of the \nimplementation of future SEDPs and in designing a governance module for future household \nliving standards surveys.  \n \n89.  Action  4.2:  Formulate  a  public  debt  management  law  consolidating  the \nmanagement of domestic and external debt (footnote 20). Viet Nam has made considerable \nprogress in modernizing its tax system and improving public expenditure management over the \npast several years. However, progress in strengthening the management of public assets and \nliabilities has been slow. In particular, the legal framework for public debt management has \nremained  weak.  The  responsibility  for  managing  public  debt  is  divided  among  several \ngovernment agencies (including the MOF) and among several units within the MOF. Information \nsharing  among  the  government  agencies  responsible  for  managing  public  debt  is  not \nsatisfactory.  \n \n90.  In an important step towards sound public debt management, the Government has \nformulated\u2014in  consultation  with  development  agencies\u2014a  law  on  public  debt.  The  law \nconsolidates to a large degree the management of domestic and external public debt in one \ndepartment  within  the  MOF  and  improves  information  sharing  among  the  MOF  and  other \ngovernment agencies that will, for historical reasons, continue playing a role in public debt \nmanagement.39  The law was passed by the National Assembly in June 2009 and will become \neffective on 1 January 2010.  \n \n91.  Action 4.2 under subprogram 2 will help strengthen public financial management and \nimprove  governance  in  Viet  Nam.  It  complements  activities  of  the  TA  for  the  Support  for \nDeveloping Capital Markets and Building Capacity in the Financial Sector (footnote 22) and the \nTA for Supporting Financial Management Decentralization (approved in December 2007).40  \n \n92.  Action 4.3: Adopt principles of competition, merit-orientation, and transparency in \nthe recruitment, appointment, promotion, and dismissal of civil servants (footnote 23). \nThe recruitment and promotion of civil servants are not always competitive, merit-based, and \ntransparent. It is one of the main reasons why public administration is weak and corruption is a \nserious problem. \n \n93.  In November 2008, the National Assembly passed the Law on Civil Servants, which will \nbecome effective on 1 January 2010. The law introduces the principles of competition, merit-\norientation, and transparency in the recruitment, appointment, promotion, and dismissal of civil \nservants. ADB assisted the Government in drafting the law through the TA for Supporting Civil \nService Reform (approved in August 2008).41 \n \n                                                \n39 In particular, the Ministry of Planning and Investment will continue coordinating all public investment projects, \nincluding those financed through external borrowing, and SBV will remain the Government's focal point for its \ninteractions with international financial institutions.  \n40 ADB. 2008.

Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Supporting Civil Service Reform. Manila. \n ", "  21 \n94.  The Ministry of Home Affairs has adopted an action plan for the implementation of the \nlaw. The plan includes drafting the necessary implementing regulations and conducting pilot civil \nservice projects, which ADB will support through the TA on civil service reform (para. 93). These \nactivities have been included in the updated policy matrix of SIPRP V as tentative action 4.5 \nunder subprogram 3.      \n \n95.  Action 4.4: Issue a comprehensive anticorruption strategy, setting out preventive, \ndemand-side,  and  sector-specific  solutions,  and  monitoring  mechanisms. 42  The \nGovernment  recognizes  that  corruption  is  a  major  hindrance  to  the  country's  economic \ndevelopment. As part of its effort to reduce corruption, the Government has adopted\u2014through \nResolution No. 21/NQ-CP dated 12 May 2009\u2014a national anticorruption strategy for the period \nup to 2020 and an action plan for the implementation of the strategy. The strategy provides for a \nwide  range  of  measures  to  combat  corruption,  including  preventive  measures  (such  as \nenhancing the transparency of policy making and creating equal opportunities for all businesses) \nand demand-side measures (such as adopting a law on access to information and narrowing \nthe range of information that is considered to be a state secret). The strategy also calls for the \ndevelopment of sector-specific and provincial plans for its implementation. The action plan \nincludes developing indicators for assessing progress in fighting corruption, conducting annual \nhousehold  and  enterprise  surveys  on  unofficial  payments  to  government  agencies,  and \ndisclosing survey results.  \nB.  Financing Plan \n96.  Some of the policy actions covered by subprogram 2 of SIPRP V entail substantial costs \nto Viet Nam\u2019s state budget. Some of the actions included in the policy matrix for PRSC 8 but not \ncovered by subprogram 2 of SIPRP V also have significant costs. For example, ensuring \nfinancial sustainability of irrigation services, while providing financial relief to poor farmers, will \ncost the state budget about $170 million in 2008, $190 million in 2009, $210 million in 2011. The \nimplementation  of  the  National  Targeted  Program  for  Adapting  to  the  Climate  Change \n(excluding the national, sector-specific, and local actions plans) will cost more than $100 million, \nhalf of which is to be provided from the state budget. The implementation of the national, sector-\nspecfic, and local action plans is likely to cost the state budget billions of dollars. The total cost \nto the state budget in 2009\u20132011 of the actions included in the policy matrix for PRSC 8 is \nestimated at $680 million.  \n \n97.  The  Government  has  requested  development  agencies  participating  in  the  PRSC \nprocess to finance a greater share of the cost of policy reforms in 2009 than in the previous \nyears.  The  reason  is  that  the  Government  is  facing  difficulties  in  financing  its  increased \nexpenditure on social safety nets. Budgetary revenue is expected to decline considerably in \n2009 compared with 2008 mostly because of lower world oil prices, lower foreign trade turnover, \nand tax reductions and deferrals aimed at stimulating growth. At the same time, the cost of \nborrowing in financial markets has increased substantially because of the global economic crisis \nand investors' heightened aversion to risk.  \n \n98.  It is proposed that a loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR64,036,000 be provided \nfor subprogram 2 of SIPRP V from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. The loan will have a term of \n24 years, including a grace period of 8 years; an annual interest rate of 1.0% during the grace \n                                                \n42 This is a more specific version of the tentative action under subprograms 2 and 3 in the original policy matrix of \nSIPRP V (adopt a comprehensive anticorruption strategy).  \n ", "22 \nperiod and 1.5% during the amortization period; and other terms and conditions set forth in the \nLoan Agreement.  \n \n99.  The  World  Bank  has  approved  PRSC  8  in  the  amount  of  $350  million  from  the \nInternational Development Association.43 More than a dozen other development agencies are \nexpected to provide grants or concessional loans totaling about $150 million as cofinancing or \nparallel financing with PRSC 8 (Appendix 7). The Government will cover the remaining cost to \nthe budget of the actions included in the policy matrix for PRSC 8. \nC.  Implementation Arrangements44 \n1.  Executing Agency \n100.  The SBV is the Executing Agency for SIPRP V. As such, it will be the Executing Agency \nfor the proposed subprogram.  \n \n101.  The SBV hosts the PRSC coordination unit, which facilitates interactions between the \nGovernment and development agencies within the framework of the PRSC process. The SBV \nwas also the Executing Agency for SIPRPs I\u2013IV.  \n2.  Disbursement and Procurement \n102.  The proposed loan will be disbursed in a single tranche upon the declaration of loan \neffectiveness.  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign  exchange  costs \n(excluding local duties and taxes) of items produced and procured in ADB member countries, \nexcluding the ineligible items listed in Appendix 8 and imports financed from other bilateral and \nmultilateral sources. \n \n103.  As provided in ADB\u2019s simplified disbursement procedures and requirements for program \nloans,45 the proceeds of the loan will be disbursed to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam as the \nBorrower. No supporting import documentation will be required, provided that the value of \nViet Nam\u2019s  total  imports  minus  imports  from  nonmember  countries,  ineligible  imports,  and \nimports financed under other official development assistance is at least equal to the amount of \nthe loan to be disbursed. The Government will certify its compliance with this formula with its \nwithdrawal  request.  Otherwise,  import  documentation  under  existing  procedures  will  be \nrequired. ADB will have the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy \nof the Borrower\u2019s certification. The Borrower's procedures for procurement and disbursement of \nfunds, and the use of counterpart funds, are considered satisfactory. \n3.  Period of Utilization \n104.  The loan will be fully utilized by 31 May 2010. \n                                                \n43 By comparison, the amount of PRSC 7 (also provided from the International Development Association) was about \n$150 million.  \n44 The implementation arrangements for SIPRP V (including its subprogram 2) are described in greater detail in ADB. \n2008. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on the Proposed Program Cluster \nand Loan for Subprogram 1 to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Support for the Implementation of the \nPoverty Reduction Program V. Manila. (pp. 20\u201322). \n45 ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila. \n ", "  23 \n4.  Anticorruption Policy \n105.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to subprogram 2 of SIPRP V. To \nsupport these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the draft \nLoan Agreement. \nVI.  SUBPROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACT, AND RISKS \nA.  Economic and Financial Benefits \n106.  The policy reforms supported by SIPRP V and, in particular, its subprogram 2 will yield \nconsiderable  economic  benefits  to  Viet  Nam  and  substantial  financial  benefits  to  the \nGovernment. They will raise the living standards of the Vietnamese people by fostering socially \ninclusive and environmentally sustainable economic growth. The reforms will also increase \nbudget revenue by expanding the tax base, and reduce budget expenditure by improving public \nfinancial management. Over the medium term, the financial benefits of these reforms to the \nGovernment are likely to exceed their costs (including interest to be paid on loans received from \ndevelopment agencies within the framework of the PRSC process). \nB.  Social Impact \n107.  A detailed poverty and social impact assessment of subprogram 2 of SIPRP V has been \nprepared.  In  particular,  the  social  implications  of  the  actions  covered  by  the  subprogram \n(including  their  indigenous  people  and  involuntary  resettlement  implications)  have  been \nreviewed. A summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 9. \n \n108.  The policy actions covered by the subprogram will have significant social effects. In \nparticular, they will help reduce poverty indirectly by improving governance and the quality of \neducation, developing businesses, and spurring economic growth. Business development and \neconomic growth will create news jobs, raise incomes, and make more resources available for \nsocial protection. The poor will benefit from new jobs, higher incomes, and increased availability \nof resources for social protection.  \n \n109.  Some of the actions under the subprogram will also make a direct contribution to poverty \nreduction. For example, action 1.4 (adopt a pricing system for electricity from renewable energy \nand provide incentives for government procurement of energy-efficient equipment) will help \nreduce poverty in areas with untapped renewable energy resources and high incidence of \npoverty (e.g., mountainous areas inhabited by ethnic minorities) by making the production of \nelectricity  from  renewable  energy  commercially  more  attractive.  Action  2.1  (formulate  an \neducation development strategy for the period up to 2020, focusing on the equity of learning \noutcomes and the relevance of contents) will help improve access of the poor, ethnic minorities \nand other disadvantaged groups of the population to education and ensure that there are no \nsignificant  differences  in  learning  outcomes  among  children  of  different  backgrounds  (i.e., \nchildren from poor households do as well as children from rich households, children in remote \nareas do as well as children in other areas, and ethnic minority children do as well as ethnic \nmajority  children).  This  action  will  also  help  eliminate  the  remaining  gender  disparities  in \neducation. Action 3.1 (issue regulations aimed to ensure financial sustainability of irrigation \nservices  and  provide  financial  relief  for  poor  farmers)  will  make  irrigation  services  more \n ", "24 \naffordable for poor farmers. Farm households headed by women will benefit more from this \naction than farm households headed by men, because the incidence of poverty among the \nformer is higher than among the latter. Action 4.1 (conduct a midterm review of SEDP 2006\u2013\n2010 and strengthen the result-based approach in the monitoring and evaluation framework for \nplanning) will help make future SEDPs more effective in reducing poverty and addressing \ngender issues.  \n \n110.  Ethnic minorities will benefit more from the policy actions covered by the subprogram \nthan the ethnic majority. However, none of the actions is centered on ethnic minorities or has an \nadverse  impact  on  ethnic  minorities.  Therefore,  the  subprogram  has  been  assigned  to \nindigenous people category C. \n \n111.  SIPRP V does not have an investment component, and the policy actions covered by its \nsubprogram 2 will not cause any involuntary resettlement. Hence, the subprogram has been \nassigned to involuntary resettlement category C. \nC.  Environmental Impact \n112.  Subprogram  2  of  SIPRP  V  has  been  assigned  to  environmental  category  C.  Its \nenvironmental implications have been reviewed and a matrix of potential environmental impacts \nhas been prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002). The matrix is in \nAppendix 10. \n \n113.  The review of the environmental implications of subprogram 2 concluded that several of \nthe actions included in the policy framework for this subprogram are likely to have at least minor \npositive environmental impact. For example, the adoption of the National Targeted Program on \nAdapting to the Climate Change is likely to have a major positive impact, while the actions \nrelated to renewable energy, irrigation services, and medical wastes are likely to have minor \npositive  impact.  Enhancement  measures  have  been  developed  to  optimize  the  expected \npositive impact. No action has been identified as likely to have an adverse environmental impact. \nD.  Assumptions and Risks \n114.  SIPRP V and, in particular, its subprogram 2 are to support policy actions that constitute \ncritical steps in the policy reforms needed for the successful implementation of SEDP 2006\u2013\n2010 and are important to ADB\u2019s operations in Viet Nam. However, the reforms need to be fully \ncarried out if SEDP 2006\u20132010 is to be successfully implemented. Therefore, it is assumed that, \nafter completing the policy actions covered by SIPRP V and the other actions included in the \npolicy matrices for the World Bank\u2019s PRSCs 7\u20139, the Government will follow through with the \npolicy reforms needed for the successful implementation of SEDP 2006\u20132010 on its own or with \nthe  support  of  development  agencies  under  other  projects.  It  is  further  assumed  that  the \ninvestment projects that are included in SEDP 2006\u20132010 and necessary for attaining its targets \nand goals will be implemented on schedule.  \n \n115.  These assumptions are based on the Government\u2019s commitment to carry out the policy \nreforms and implement the investment projects that are needed to achieve the targets and goals \nof  SEDP  2006\u20132010.  Furthermore,  policy  reforms  that  are  needed  for  the  successful \nimplementation  of  SEDP  2006\u20132010  are  now  or  will  be  supported  by  ADB  through  other \npolicy-based loans to Viet Nam (such as the financial sector program loans and the small and \nmedium-sized enterprise development loans) and by other development agencies both within \nand outside the framework of the PRSC process. \n ", "  25 \n \n116.  The slowdown of growth caused by the global economic crisis could be so prolonged \nthat it will preclude the successful implementation of SEDP 2006\u20132010 and, in particular, the \nachievement of its poverty target. However, this risk is small. The fiscal stimulus measures \nadopted by the Government in January\u2013May 2009 will spur growth in the second half of 2009 \nand in 2010. Moreover, the external environment is expected to improve significantly in 2010. \nAccordingly, economic growth is likely to rebound in the second half of 2009 and accelerate \nfurther in 2010.  \n \n117.  As economic growth accelerates and world commodity prices rise, inflation could surge \nagain. High inflation could push many households into poverty and preclude the successful \nimplementation of SEDP 2006-2010. To mitigate this risk, the SBV has started taking measures \nto keep inflation in check. In particular, it has committed to limit growth of money supply to 30% \nin 2009; asked state-owned commercial banks to limit loan growth to 25% in 2009; and urged all \ncommercial banks to tighten credit for consumer spending and purchases of real estate and \nstocks. The SBV is expected to start tightening monetary policy toward the end of 2009 and \npursue moderately tight monetary policy in 2010.46 \nVII.  ASSURANCES \n118.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the draft loan agreement: \n \n(i)  The  actions  covered  by  subprogram  2  of  SIPRP  V  and  specified  in  the \nDevelopment Policy Letter will continue to be in effect during the implementation \nof SEDP 2006\u20132010 and thereafter; and \n(ii)  Adequate and timely counterpart funds for carrying out these actions will be \nmade available. \nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n119.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various \ncurrencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 64,036,000 to the Socialist Republic of Viet \nNam for subprogram 2 of the Support for the Implementation of the Poverty Reduction Program \nV from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum \nduring the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 24 years, including a grace \nperiod of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with \nthose set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board. \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n22 September 2009 \n \n \n                                                \n46 ADB. 2009.

Recent Progress in Poverty Reduction in Viet Nam \n1.  Viet Nam made remarkable progress in poverty reduction in the past 15\u201320 years. The \nmost recent available household survey data show that the poverty rate (based on the cost of a \nconsumption basket allowing for a daily intake of 2,100 calories per person and some nonfood \nexpenditure)  dropped  from  58.1%  in  1993  to  16.0%  in  2006.  The  food  poverty  rate  (the \nproportion of people whose total expenditure would not suffice for a daily intake of 2,100 \ncalories even if it was entirely allocated to food) fell from 24.9% to 6.7% between 1993 and \n2006. The poverty gap (the difference between the poverty line and the average expenditure of \nthe poor expressed as a percentage of the former) narrowed from 18.5% to 3.8% over the same \nperiod (Table A2.1). \n \nTable A2.1: Selected Poverty Indicators for Viet Nam, 1993\u20132006 \n \nIndicator  1993  1998  2002  2004  2006 \nPoverty rate (%)  58.1   37.4   28.9   19.5   16.0 \n  Urban areas  25.1   9.2   6.6   3.6   3.9 \n  Rural areas  66.4   45.5   35.6   25.0   20.4 \n  Kinh and Chinese   53.9   31.1   23.1   13.5   10.3 \n  Ethnic minorities   86.4   75.2   69.3   60.7   52.2 \nFood poverty rate (%)  24.9   15.0   10.9   7.4   6.7 \n  Urban areas  7.9   2.5   1.9   0.8   1.2 \n  Rural areas  29.1   18.6   13.6   9.7   8.7 \n  Kinh and Chinese   20.8   10.6   6.5   3.5   3.2 \n  Ethnic minorities   52.0   41.8   41.5   34.2   29.2 \nPoverty gap (%)  18.5   9.5   6.9   4.7   3.8 \n  Urban areas  6.4   1.7   1.3   0.7   3.2 \n  Rural areas  21.5   11.8   8.7   6.1   4.9 \n  Kinh and Chinese   16.0   7.1   4.7   2.6   2.0 \n  Ethnic minorities  34.7   24.2   22.8   19.2   15.4 \nSource: World Bank. 2007.

Measures of poverty not based on household survey data point to declines of similar \nmagnitudes in poverty, although they give different levels of poverty. The proportion of people \nliving on less than $1.0 a day based on purchasing power parity (PPP) dropped from 50.8% of \nthe population in 1990 to 4.0% in 2007, and the proportion of those living on less than $2.0 per \nday based on PPP fell from 87.0% to 32.9% (Table A2.2).

It has achieved three MDG targets and is likely to attain another four ahead of \ntime. In addition to the targets for extreme poverty and hunger, Viet Nam has achieved the \ntarget concerning the incidence of malaria and other diseases. The country is likely to achieve \nthe  targets  for  the  completion  of  primary  schooling  by  boys  and  girls,  gender  equality  in \neducation, under-5 mortality, and maternal mortality (Table A2.3). \nB.  Challenges in Poverty Reduction \n4.  Despite the tremendous strides Viet Nam has made in eradicating poverty over the past \n15\u201320 years, much remains to be done. First, the absolute number of poor people is still large, \nalthough their share in the total population has been drastically reduced. The household survey \ndata show that 13.5 million people lived in poverty and 5.7 million people suffered from hunger \nin 2006. The poverty rate based on MOLISA's methodology suggests that 11.3 million people \nlived below the official poverty line in 2008. According to the World Bank, 3.4 million people \nsurvived on less than $1.0 per day (based on PPP) and 28.1 million people lived on less than \n$2.0 per day (based on PPP) in 2007 (Table A2.2). \n \n5.  Second, the incidence of poverty is still high in rural areas and among ethnic minorities, \neven though it has been decreasing faster than in urban areas and among the ethnic majority. \nIn 2006, the poverty rate was 20.4% in rural areas (compared with 3.9% in urban areas), and \n52.2% among ethnic minorities (compared with 10.2% among the Kinh and Chinese majority) \n(Table A2.1). Rural areas accounted for 73.3% of the total population but 93.6% of the poor. \nEthnic minorities made up only 13.5% of the total population but 44.4% of the poor (Table A2.4). \n \n ", "34  Appendix 2   \nTable A2.3: Viet Nam's Progress toward the Millennium Development Goals \n \nGoal 1  Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger  Progress  Status \nTarget 1.1  Halve, between 1990 and 2015, the  Poverty reduced by more two-thirds  Already \nproportion of people living in poverty  between 1993 and 2006  achieved \nTarget 1.3  Halve, between 1990 and 2015, the  Proportion reduced by more than two-  Already \nproportion who suffer from hunger  thirds between 1993 and 2006  achieved \nGoal 2  Achieve universal primary education  Progress  Status \nTarget 2.1  Ensure that, by 2015, children everywhere,  Primary education completion rate was  Likely to be \nboys and girls alike, will be able to complete a  85.6% in 2007  achieved \nfull course of primary schooling \nGoal 3  Promote gender equality  Progress  Status \nTarget 3.1  Eliminate gender disparity in primary and  There are only small gender  Likely to be \nsecondary education, preferably by 2005, and  disparities in education, with a higher  achieved \nin all levels of education no later than 2015  proportion of boys in primary and \nsecondary education and a higher \nproportion of girls in vocational and \nuniversity education \nGoal 4  Reduce child mortality  Progress  Status \nTarget 4.1  Reduce by two thirds, between 1990 and  The under-5 mortality rate fell from 58  Likely to be \n2015, the under-5 mortality rate  (per 1,000 live births) in 1990 to 25  achieved \n(per 1,000 live births) in 2008 \nGoal 5  Improve maternal health  Progress  Status \nTarget 5.1  Reduce by three quarters, between 1990 and  The maternal mortality ratio fell from  Likely to be \n2015, the maternal mortality ratio  233 (per 100,000 live births) in 1990 to  achieved \n75 (per 100,000 live births) in 2008 \nGoal 6  Combat HIV/AIDS and other diseases  Progress  Status \nTarget 6.1  By 2015 have halted and begun to  The number of detected HIV/AIDS  Uncertain to \nreverse the spread of HIV/AIDS  cases rose from about 1,500 a year in  be achieved \n1990\u20131993 to more than 20,000 a year \nin 2005\u20132007 \nTarget 6.3  By 2015 halted and reverse the  The number of malaria cases dropped  Already \nincidence of malaria and other diseases  significantly in recent years, with only  achieved \n20 malaria-related deaths in 2007 \nGoal 7  Ensure environmental sustainability  Progress  Status \nTarget 7.1  Embrace sustainability and reverse the  Forest cover up, but losses in closed  Uncertain to \nloss of environmental resources  canopy forest and biodiversity  be achieved \nTarget 7.3  Halve, by 2015 the share of people  Rapid progress on drinking water, but  Uncertain to \nwithout drinking water and sanitation  much slower progress on sanitation  be achieved \nSource: Government of Viet Nam, United Nations Development Programme, World Bank, and Asian Development \nBank staff assessment. \n \n6.  Third, the rural poor and poor ethnic minority people not only account for relatively large \nproportions of their respective population groups, but also have significantly lower average \nincomes than the urban poor and poor ethnic majority people, respectively. In 2006, the poverty \ngap was 4.9% in the rural areas and 15.4% among ethnic minorities, compared with 3.2% in the \nurban areas and 2.0% among the Kinh and Chinese majority (Table A2.4). \n ", "  Appendix 2  35  \nTable A2.4: Distribution of Poverty in Viet Nam, 2006 \n(%) \nShare of  Poverty  Poverty  Contribution to \nPopulation group  Population  Rate  Gap  Total Poverty \nTotal population  100.0  16.0  3.8  100.0 \n  Rural   73.3   20.4   4.9   93.6 \n  Urban   26.7   3.9   0.8   6.4 \nKinh and Hoa   86.5   10.2   2.0   55.6 \nEthnic minorities   13.5   52.2   15.4   44.4 \nSource: World Bank. 2008.

In \n2006,  the  poverty  rate  was  30.2%  in  the  Northern  Mountains  (49.0%  in  the  Northwest \nMountains), 29.1% in the North Central Coast, and 28.6% in the Central Highlands, compared \nwith 5.8% in the Southeast and 8.8% in the Red River Delta (Table A2.5).  \n \nTable A2.5: Poverty Rate in Viet Nam by Region, 1993\u20132006 \n(%) \nRegion  1993  1998  2002  2004  2006 \nNorthern Mountains   81.5   64.2   43.9   35.4   30.2 \nNortheast       38.4   29.4   25.0 \nNorthwest      68.0   58.6   49.0 \nRed River Delta   62.7   29.3   22.4   12.1   8.8 \nNorth Central Coast   74.5   48.1   43.9   31.9   29.1 \nSouth Central Coast   47.2   34.5   25.2   19.0   12.6 \nCentral Highlands   70.0   52.4   51.8   33.1   28.6 \nSoutheast   37.0   12.2   10.6   5.4   5.8 \nMekong Delta   47.1   36.9   23.4   15.9   10.3 \nViet Nam   58.1   37.4   28.9   19.5   16.0 \nSource: World Bank. 2007.

Fifth, the vulnerability of the population to poverty is rather high. The large difference \nbetween the proportion of the population living on less than $2.0 a day based on PPP (32.9% in \n2007) and the share of those living on less than $1.0 a day based on PPP (4.0% in 2007) \nsuggests that the near-poor account for a substantial proportion of the population. A small \nexternal or internal shock and a moderate deterioration in the economic situation could push \nmany of these people into poverty. \n \n ", "36  Appendix 2   \n9.  Finally, some negative trends in poverty have emerged recently. The household survey \ndata show that urban poverty increased between 2004 and 2006, with the poverty rate rising \nfrom 3.6% in 2004 to 3.9% in 2006, and the food poverty rate increasing from 0.8% to 1.2%. \nAnecdotal evidence suggests that high inflation and, in particular, the steep rise of food prices \npushed many low-income households, especially in urban areas, into poverty in 2008. As \neconomic activity slowed sharply, unemployment increased and more households, particularly \nin rural areas, fell into poverty in the first several months of 2009. Many people from rural areas \nwho were employed in urban areas of Viet Nam or abroad lost their jobs and stopped sending \nremittances to their households. Some of them returned to their villages, even though they had \nfew alternative sources of income there.    \nC.  Policy Framework for Poverty Reduction  \n10.  Robust economic growth has been the key driver of poverty reduction in Viet Nam, but \ngovernment policies and targeted programs have played a major role in making that growth \npro-poor.  The  Government\u2019s  current  poverty  reduction  strategy  is  embedded  in  the \nSocioeconomic Development Plan (SEDP) 2006\u20132010.  \n \n1.  Socioeconomic Development Plan 2006\u20132010.  \n \n11.  The Government adopted SEDP 2006\u20132010 in 2006. Unlike previous SEDPs, it was \nprepared  in  an  open  and  participatory  manner  involving  extensive  consultations  with  civil \nsociety,  businesses,  and  development  agencies,  and  is  oriented  more  toward  attaining \ndevelopment  outcomes  (including  poverty  reduction)  and  less  toward  achieving  production \ntargets. Its targets include a reduction in the poverty rate (based on MOLISA\u2019s methodology) \nfrom 22% in 2005 to 10%\u201311% in 2010. SEDP 2006\u20132010 also aspires to strengthen the \nfoundations  for  environmentally  sustainable  and  socially  inclusive  economic  growth  and  a \ncontinued reduction in poverty beyond 2010. It provides for a broad range of policy reforms and \na large number of investment projects aimed at achieving its targets and goals. The joint \nInternational  Development  Association\u2013International  Monetary  Fund  staff  advisory  note  of \n5 December 2006 on Viet Nam\u2019s poverty reduction strategy concluded that SEDP 2006\u20132010 \nhas the key features of a poverty reduction strategy and is likely to lead to economic growth and \npoverty reduction.2 \n2.  Social Protection and Targeted Programs for Poverty Reduction \n12.  SEDP 2006\u20132010 recognizes that social protection and targeted programs for poverty \nreduction are required for inclusive growth. Social protection expands opportunities, enhances \nequity,  and  protects  against  risks  and  shocks.  Targeted  programs  focus  on  particularly \ndisadvantaged groups and geographic areas. \n \n13.  Viet Nam fares reasonably well in comparison with the 30 other countries in Asia and the \nPacific, according to ADB\u2019s social protection index (SPI).3 The SPI values range from a low of \n0.01 (Papua New Guinea) to a high of 0.96 (Japan). Viet Nam\u2019s SPI of 0.38 ranks the country \n13 of 31, just below Nauru but above Malaysia. The SPI is a composite index based on four \nsocial protection summary indicators. Expenditure measures total expenditure on all social \n                                                \n2  International Monetary Fund and International Development Association. 2006.

Coverage \nmeasures the beneficiaries of targeted social protection as a share of the reference population \ngroup, i.e., the elderly, the disabled, the unemployed, etc. (0.40). Distribution calculates the \nnumber of beneficiaries who are poor as a share of the poor population, or efficiency of poverty \ntargeting (0.71). Impact is the average social protection expenditure for each poor person as a \nshare of the national poverty line (0.17). Viet Nam falls into the group of countries with an \naverage SPI ranking (the average for Asia is 0.36). The policy priority for countries with average \nSPIs is likely to be improving the efficiency, functioning, and targeting of current programs. The \nsocial protection summary indicator for impact, at 17%, is lower than the average of 23% for \nAsia. \n \n14.  Social  Safety  Nets.  Social  safety  net  programs  (e.g.,  social  assistance  and  child \nprotection) account for about 30% of Viet Nam\u2019s total social protection expenditure. The target \ngroup coverage ratios are 65% of the poor, 100% of the disabled, and 62% of targeted children. \nViet Nam\u2019s overall social protection summary indicator for coverage, at 0.40, is high; only eight \nother countries have values higher. In a decentralized country like Viet Nam, the amount of \nbudgetary resources at the local level has a major influence on the ability to implement social \npolicy, deliver social services, and provide safety nets. According to the Vietnam Development \nReport 2008, powerful allocation norms have been set up to transfer resources from richer to \npoorer provinces (on a scale much larger than similar efforts in richer countries). However, there \nhas been less progress in the allocation of provincial resources to districts, communes, and \nbelow. In general, the quality of programs targeted at specific households is mixed. Some have \nconsiderable impact, but others are less effective. \n \n15.  Labor  Market  Programs.  The  SPI  assessment  of social  protection  expenditure  by \ncategory of program shows that only 7.7% of the total goes toward labor market programs \n(direct  employment  generation,  labor  exchanges  and  other  employment  services,  skills \ndevelopment and training, and the development of labor legislation). \n \n16.  Each of the country\u2019s 63 provinces has a vocational training center under the local \ndepartment  of  labor,  invalids,  and  social  affairs.  The  Government  implements  a  National \nTargeted Program on Job Generation and provides credit through the National Fund for Job \nCreation and the Social Policy Bank. The vocational training system is being strengthened and \ndiversified  to  meet  the  demands  of  the  labor  market.  The  Government  does  not  provide \nunemployment insurance, but it does give (i) allowances for early retirement, (ii) access to credit \nfor opening new business after retirement, and (iii) free vocational training for the poor in \ngovernment-run vocational training centers. In the ADB SPI analysis of target group coverage \nratios, only 9.4% of the unemployed and underemployed are covered by social protection \nprograms. \n \n17.  Viet Nam introduced a minimum wage for foreign-invested companies in 1990 and for \ndomestic enterprises in 1993. The former varies by region; the latter is uniform throughout the \ncountry. The ratio between minimum and average wages in domestic enterprises has increased \nmoderately,  from  25%  in  1998  to  32%  in  2006,  but  minimum  wages  applying  to  foreign \ncompanies remain substantially higher. The margin varies from more than 50% to more than \n90% depending on the region. This is incompatible with the national treatment principle of the \nWorld Trade Organization. Thus, Viet Nam needs to unify the minimum wage, which will mean \nincreasing the domestic enterprise minimum wage. This may affect employment creation and \nformalization.  \n \n ", "38  Appendix 2   \n18.  Old-Age Pensions. Until 1993, Viet Nam only had an old-age pension program for civil \nservants  and  workers  in  state-owned  enterprises. The  coverage  was extended  in  1993  to \ndomestic and foreign private enterprises on a contributory basis. Viet Nam Social Security \nadministers these programs. There is also a noncontributory scheme (administered by MOLISA) \nfor people over 85 who lack resources. The system is now undergoing major and rapid reform. \nThe first Social Insurance Law was passed in 2006, with various elements being implemented \nover 2007\u20132009. The aim is to expand coverage and ensure financial sustainability. Along with \na voluntary pension program for informal sector workers, the compulsory program applies to all \nVietnamese working in any enterprise provided they have at least a 3-month contract. To \nreceive a pension, participants must contribute for 20 years. The minimum pension is set equal \nto the minimum wage; the maximum is 75% of the average salary. Retirement age is low at 55 \nfor women and 60 for men. The main difference between the voluntary and the compulsory \nprograms is that the voluntary scheme does not have a ceiling on contributions and or a \nminimum pension. \n \n19.  Participation in the compulsory scheme is growing steadily from its low base, with about \n8  million  active  contributors  in  2007  (18%  of  the  labor  force  and  54%  of  employment  in \nstate-owned enterprises, foreign companies, and private domestic firms). In 2007, there were \nabout 1.9 million pensioners, about 25% of the population 60 years old and above. However, \nalmost half of pension spending went to the richest two quintiles, with only 2% to the poorest. \nThus, the pension system is not pro-poor. Whether the national voluntary pension program for \nthe informal sector will attract many members is not yet clear. The largest voluntary pension \nscheme in Viet Nam operates in the province of Nghe An, with about 85,000 participants in \n2007. \n \n20.  Targeted Programs for Poverty Reduction.4 Viet Nam implements a host of targeted \nprograms to reach the most disadvantaged. Some provide cash support to particular vulnerable \ngroups; others deliver other forms of targeted assistance to disadvantaged groups or regions. \nThe pricing of utilities such as water can also be based on different groups\u2019 ability to pay. Cash \ntransfers  are  paid  out  by  social  guarantee  funds,  which  provide  regular  relief  to  defined \nvulnerable groups and to war veterans and war invalids. Subsidies are provided through the \nNational Targeted Program for Poverty Reduction (NTPPR) 2006\u20132010, formerly the Hunger \nEradication and Poverty Reduction Program. Development assistance to poor communes is \nmanaged through Program 135 (program for socioeconomic development in communes facing \nextreme hardship in ethnic minority and mountainous areas); Program 132 and Program 134, \nwhich seek to provide ethnic minorities with agricultural and residential land, housing, and water \nsupply; and the Support Program for Fast and Sustainable Poverty Reduction in 61 Poor \nDistricts. These initiatives differ in the nature of the benefits they provide, as well as in the \ntargeting techniques they apply to identify beneficiaries. \n \n21.  The NTPPR targets households that have been identified as poor using the MOLISA \nmethodology.  Activities  under  NTPPR  fall  into  three  areas:  (i)  development  of  productive \nactivities of the poor, (ii) provision of access to basic services, and (iii) capacity development \nand  monitoring.  The  first  area  includes  the  largest  single  component  of  the  NTPPR,  the \nprovision of preferential credit. The second area focuses on health care, education, housing, \nwater supply, and legal aid. A total of D43.5 trillion has been allocated to this program over a 5 \nyears, with 60% going to the provision of preferential credit. The central budget covers 29% of \n                                                \n4  This discussion is summarized from World Bank. 2007.

Program 135 is geographically targeted. The first phase of the program allocated D700 \nmillion per year to identified communes. Poverty maps show that the communes targeted by the \nprogram were generally those with higher poverty rates. Targeting issues arise at lower levels, \nas resource allocation may favor wealthier villages within a commune, and not everyone in a \nvillage is necessarily poor. The second phase of Program 135 (to be implemented during 2006\u2013\n2010) is tackling these issues by requiring the inclusion of both poorer villages within the \npoorest \u201czone III\u201d communes and the poorest villages in the less-poor \u201czone II\u201d communes. \n \n23.  The Support Program for Fast and Sustainable Poverty Reduction in 61 Poor Districts \nwas  approved  in  December  2008.  It  targets  61  districts  where  the  poverty  rate  based  on \nMOLISA's methodology was more than 50% in 2006. The program aims to reduce the poverty \nrate in the target districts to less than 40% by 2010, to the corresponding provincial average \npoverty rate by 2015, and to the corresponding regional average poverty rate by 2020. The \nactivities  under  the  program  include  providing  free  rice  to  poor  households;  supporting \nagriculture, forestry, fishery, and food processing businesses (especially those being set up or \nrun by poor households); improving the quality of and access to vocational training; developing \ntransport and irrigation infrastructure; and providing incentives to businesses for investing and \ncreating jobs in the target districts. The total cost of the program for 2009\u20132020 is estimated at \nD160 trillion, of which D10.5 trillion was transferred from the central to local budgets in early \n2009.  \n ", " \n4\n0\nSUPPORT

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.   Links to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \n \nViet Nam\u2019s poverty reduction strategy is embedded in the Socioeconomic Development Plan (SEDP) 2006\u20132010. SEDP \n2006\u20132010 provides for a broad range of policy reforms and a large number of investment projects aimed at reducing poverty. \nOne of its targets is to reduce the poverty rate (based on the methodology of the Ministry of Labor, Invalids, and Social \nAffairs) from 20.2% in 2005 to 10%\u201311% in 2010. SEDP 2006\u20132010 also aspires to strengthen the foundations for \nenvironmentally sustainable and socially inclusive economic growth and a continued reduction in poverty beyond 2010. The \njoint International Development Association\u2013International Monetary Fund staff advisory note of 5 December 2006 on Viet \nNam\u2019s poverty reduction strategy concluded that SEDP 2006\u20132010 has the key features of a poverty reduction strategy and is \nlikely to lead to economic growth and poverty reduction.a \n \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) country strategy and program (2007\u20132010) for Viet Nam is aligned with SEDP 2006\u2013\n2010. It provides for assistance to the Government in both carrying out the policy reforms and implementing the investment \nprojects that are needed for the successful implementation of SEDP 2006\u20132010. Its primary focus is on promoting business-\nled, pro-poor economic growth by developing infrastructure, improving the business environment, strengthening financial and \nrelated market institutions, and building up human capital. The country strategy and program also aims to foster social \ninclusiveness, enhance management of the environment, and improve governance.b \n \nIn 2008, ADB approved the Support for the Implementation of the Poverty Reduction Program (SIPRP) V, a program cluster \nwith three chronologically ordered subprograms, and a loan for its subprogram 1.c  SIPRP V is intended to help\u2014through the \npoverty reduction support credit (PRSC) process led by the World Bank\u2014the Government carry out policy reforms needed for \nthe successful implementation of SEDP 2006\u20132010. Subprogram 1 of SIPRP V provided parallel financing with the World \nBank's PRSC 7, and subprogram 2 will provide parallel financing with PRSC 8 within the framework of the PRSC process.  \n \nThe policy reforms supported by SIPRP V and, in particular by its subprogram 2, closely match the priorities of ADB's country \nstrategy and program (2007\u20132010) for Viet Nam. They fall into the following four broad reform areas: \n \n(i)  Business development. Improving financial management and corporate governance of state-owned enterprises \n(SOEs), developing the financial and private sectors, and improving the quality of infrastructure services. \n(ii)  Social inclusion. Improving the quality of health care and education and access to these services.  \n(iii)  Natural resource management. Strengthening the management of water resources and the protection of the \nenvironment. \n(iv)  Governance. Improving planning processes, strengthening public financial management and pubic administration, \nand reducing corruption. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nAlthough Viet Nam made remarkable progress in poverty reduction in the past 15\u201320 years, much remains to be done. The \nabsolute number of people living in poverty is still large. The incidence of poverty varies significantly across regions and is \nrelatively high in the rural areas and among ethnic minorities. Since the number of near-poor people is large, the vulnerability \nof the population to poverty is high. A high inflation rate and, in particular, the steep rise in food prices pushed many low-\nincome households, especially in urban areas, into poverty in 2008. As economic activity slowed sharply, unemployment \nincreased and more households, particularly in rural areas, fell into poverty in the first several months of 2009.  \n \n2.  Design Features  \n \nSubprogram 2 of SIPRP V will help Viet Nam resolve the remaining issues in poverty reduction by helping the Government \ncarry out a broad range of policy reforms needed for the successful implementation of SEDP 2006\u20132010. These reforms will \nimprove governance, develop businesses, and stimulate economic growth. Business development and economic growth will \ncreate news jobs, raise incomes, and make more resources available for social protection. Poor regions, ethnic minorities, \n ", "    Appendix 9  61 \nand poor and near-poor people in rural and urban areas are likely to benefit from new jobs, higher incomes, and increased \navailability of resources for social protection. The reforms supported by subprogram 2 of SIPRP V will also make growth more \nsocially inclusive by improving the quality of health care and education as well as access to these services. \n \nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending \nThe main positive impact on poverty of the policy reforms supported by subprogram 2 of SIPRP V will be indirect. These \nreforms will help reduce poverty in Viet Nam primarily by improving the allocation of scarce resources and fostering socially \ninclusive economic growth.  \n \nSome of the policy actions under the subprogram will also make a direct contribution to poverty reduction. In particular, action \n1.4 (adopt a pricing system for electricity from renewable energy and provide incentives for government procurement of \nenergy-efficient equipment) will help reduce poverty in areas with untapped renewable energy resources and high incidence \nof poverty (e.g., mountainous areas inhabited by ethnic minorities) by making the production of electricity from renewable \nenergy commercially more attractive. Action 2.1 (formulate an education development strategy for the period up to 2020 \nfocusing on the equity of learning outcomes and the relevance of contents) will help improve access of the poor, ethnic \nminorities, and other disadvantaged groups of the population to education and ensure that there are no significant differences \nin learning outcomes among children of different backgrounds (i.e., children from poor households do as well as children from \nrich households, children from remote areas do as well as children from other areas, and ethnic minority children do as well \nas ethnic majority children). Action 3.1 (issue regulations aimed to ensure financial sustainability of irrigation services and \nprovide financial relief for poor farmers) will make irrigation services more affordable for poor farmers. Millions of Vietnamese \npeople (including the poor) who are expected to be adversely affected by the climate change will benefit from action 3.2 \n(approve  a  national  target  program  for  adapting  to  climate  change  and  allocate  institutional  responsibilities  for  its \nimplementation). Action 4.1 (conduct a midterm review of SEDP 2006\u20132010 and strengthen the result-based approach in the \nmonitoring and evaluation framework for planning) will help make future SEDPs more effective in reducing poverty. \n \nThe policy reforms supported by subprogram 2 of SIPRP will help Viet Nam make further progress on the targets of the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDG) concerning extreme poverty, hunger, and the incidence of malaria and other diseases, \nwhich Viet Nam has already achieved. The reforms will also help Viet Nam attain the MDG targets pertaining to primary \nschool completion, gender equality in education, and environmental sustainability. \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis \n \nWhile the policy actions under subprogram 2 of SIPRP V are likely to affect all population groups in Viet Nam, they are likely \nto have a relatively larger impact on the poor, ethnic minorities, rural population, and people who can be adversely affected by \nclimate  change.  The  reason  is  that  the  actions  are  aimed  at  reducing  poverty  by  fostering  socially  inclusive  and \nenvironmentally sustainable economic growth, and the incidence of poverty is high among ethnic minorities and in the rural \nareas.    \n \nThe poverty rate based on the methodology of the Ministry of Labor, Invalids, and Social Affairs suggests that 11.3 million \npeople lived below the official poverty line in 2008. According to the household survey data, 13.5 million people lived in \npoverty and 5.7 million people suffered from hunger in 2006. Rural areas accounted for 73.3% of the total population but \n93.6% of the poor. Ethnic minorities made up 13.5% of the total population but 44.4% of the poor.d \n \nClimate change is expected to affect millions of people in Viet Nam. According to one study, a sea level rise of 1 meter would \naffect 11% of Viet Nam's population. The proportion of people adversely affected by the sea level rise would be particularly \nhigh in the Mekong River and Sun Red River deltas.e \n \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Provide a summary of consultations and participation during the project preparation. \n \nThe Viet Nam Development Report 2007 provides analytical underpinnings for SIPRP V and, in particular, it subprogram 2. \nThe report was jointly prepared by 16 development agencies (including ADB) in 2006. The report analyzes medium-term \ndevelopment challenges facing Viet Nam and reviews the Government\u2019s strategy for overcoming these challenges (as set out \nin SEDP 2006\u20132010). It also proposes a set of policy actions aimed at successful implementation of SEDP 2006\u20132010. Some \nof these actions were covered by subprogram 1 of SIPRP V. \n \nSubprogram 2 of SIPRP V is to support actions included in the policy matrix for PRSC 8, focusing on those actions that \ncomplement actions supported by ADB\u2019s other program loans to Viet Nam or are otherwise important to ADB\u2019s operations in \n ", "62  Appendix 9 \nthe country. In late 2008, the development agencies participating in the PRSC process (including ADB) agreed among \nthemselves as well as with the Government, civil society, and private sector on the initial policy matrix for PRSC 8. Between \nDecember 2008 and May 2009, the development agencies and the Government held several rounds of consultations on the \ninitial policy matrix for PRSC 8. In May 2009, they agreed on the final policy matrix for PRSC 8. The actions to be covered by \nsubprogram 2 of SIPRP were selected\u2014in consultation with the Government and various units within ADB\u2014from the actions \nincluded in the final policy matrix of PRSC 8. \n \n2.

If no, explain why. \n \nC.  Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues. \n \nViet Nam has made good progress in eliminating gender disparities in recent years and is on track to achieve the MDG target \nfor gender equality in education. However, some gender disparities remain. Notably, only 10.9% of land use certificates for \nagricultural land and 31.3% of land use certificates for forest land bore the name of both husband and wife in 2006. More boys \nthan girls were enrolled in primary and secondary education, whereas more girls than boys were enrolled in vocational and \nuniversity education in the 2006\u20132007 school year.f While children from poor households have less education and health care \nopportunities than children from rich households, girls from poor households have even less opportunities than boys from \npoor households. Living conditions in mountainous and other remote areas are particularly harsh for girls and women.   \n \nSome policy actions under subprogram 2 of SIPRP V will help eliminate remaining gender gaps. For example, action 1.4 \n(adopt a pricing system for electricity from renewable energy and provide incentives for government procurement of energy-\nefficient equipment) will raise living standards of girls and women in mountainous and other remote areas by stimulating the \nproduction of electricity from renewable energy in those areas and improving girls and women's access to modern education \nand health facilities and equipment (such as computers and the internet). Action 2.1 (formulate an education development \nstrategy for the period up to 2020 focusing on the equity of learning outcomes and the relevance of contents) will help \neliminate the remaining disparities in education. Farm households headed by women will benefit more from action 3.1 (issue \nregulations to ensure financial sustainability of irrigation services and provide financial relief for poor farmers) than farm \nhouseholds headed by men because the incidence of poverty among the former is higher than among the latter. Action 4.1. \n(conduct a midterm review of SEDP 2006\u20132010 and strengthen the resulted-based approach in the monitoring and evaluation \nframework for planning) helps make future SEDPs more effective in addressing gender issues. \n \n2.
