The  regional  knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  increase  the \nknowledge and capacity of Asian Development Bank (ADB) stakeholders in preventing and \ndetecting integrity violations in public services.1 This will be achieved through training via e-\nlearning modules, workshops, and conferences for ADB\u2019s stakeholders in developing member \ncountries (DMCs). \n \n2.  This TA is included in the approved work plan for 2018 of ADB\u2019s Office of Anticorruption \nand Integrity (OAI).2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Corruption, fraud, and money laundering harm economic development and hinder efforts \nto reduce poverty. Corruption serves as a tax that disproportionately targets the poor, is a \ndeterrent to inclusive growth, and is intrinsically linked to money laundering. Bribery or the theft \nof  public  funds  is  a  form  of  corrupt  activity  that  is  generally  committed  for  private  gain. \nCorruption and bribery damage economies by diverting resources that are intended to serve the \npublic good. \n  \n4.  To achieve its goal of a prosperous, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable Asia and the \nPacific, ADB must expand activities that seek to improve governance and rule of law, and that \ndirectly reduce opportunities for corruption and integrity violations. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy \n(1998, as amended to date) requires ADB to support efficient, effective, accountable, and \ntransparent  public  administration  and  to  improve  the  governance  capacity  of  DMCs\u2014 \nspecifically with regard to anticorruption\u2014to ensure the efficient use of ADB resources. \n \n5.  Many of ADB\u2019s stakeholders lack the institutional capacity to address corruption, or to \nprevent and detect fraud. Most have poor access to information about ADB\u2019s Anticorruption \nPolicy requirements and effective mechanisms to prevent and address corruption, fraud, and \nother integrity violations. Few of ADB\u2019s stakeholders have the appropriate capacity and skills to \nidentify, prevent, and minimize integrity violations in ADB-funded projects. \n \n6.  ADB has been providing training to improve anticorruption and anti-money laundering \nskills and knowledge to project stakeholders, representatives of anticorruption agencies, and \nsupreme audit institutions. Since 2013, about 2,260 persons from 24 DMCs have received \nshort-term training (lasting 1\u20132 days). This training has been effective to the extent that the \nparticipants stated that the training provided the required knowledge, skills, and attitudes to \neffectively address integrity issues in project management.3 The training is complemented by \nproject procurement-related reviews (PPRRs) that aim to identify integrity risks in procurement, \nfinancial management, and asset management, and how these can be mitigated.4 \n \n                                                \n1  ADB stakeholders include all parties that can affect or be affected by ADB\u2019s actions, objectives and policies, such \nas executing and implementing agencies of ADB-funded projects; project beneficiaries; government agencies; civil \nsociety organizations; and existing and potential project contractors, suppliers, consultants, and auditors.  \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on {day Month year}. \n3  Exit  questioners  from  ADB  TA  projects  (ADB.  Enhancing  Integrity  and  Anticorruption  Awareness  in  Asian \nDevelopment Bank Projects, and ADB. Prevention and Detection of Fraud and Corruption) indicated 70% of \nparticipants were completely satisfied and the remaining 30% partially satisfied with the knowledge and skills \nprovided (many requested longer and more frequent workshops). \n4  Since 2003, OAI has conducted 80 project procurement-related reviews, covering 121 loans and grants. \n ", "2 \n7.  While the direct results of this increased capacity are not measurable (e.g., as reduced \nintegrity  violations),  the  confirmation  by  participants\u2014and statements by  close  to  100%  of \nparticipants that they will recommend similar training to their colleagues\u2014shows there is a large \ndemand for continuation and expansion of the training program. This demand is increased by \nthe expanding volume of ADB\u2019s committed operations and natural, ongoing staff turnover. \n \n8.  Participants\u2019 responses to exit questionnaires highlighted three issues that should be \naddressed in future training: (i) allocate additional time (3\u20134 days) for training to allow for \ndetailed  discussion  of  subject  matter;  (ii)  target  training  to  specific  stakeholders  (e.g., \nanticorruption agencies and audit firms on procurement; and project management units on \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy and due diligence); and (iii) include more practical applications of \ntechniques and case studies. \n \n9.  In 1999, ADB and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development set up \nthe Anticorruption Initiative for Asia and the Pacific.5 The Anticorruption Initiative established a \nregional  network  of  government  anticorruption  agencies  to  promote  anticorruption  through \npractical capacity development activities, including anticorruption thematic and country reviews, \nregional meetings, and conferences. \n \n10.  In 2018, members of the Anticorruption Initiative requested that ADB, the Organisation \nfor  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development,  and  other  development  partners  continue \nsupporting the regional anticorruption network as a platform to share effective anticorruption \nactivities to enhance the policy and technical expertise of countries in fighting corruption and \npromoting good governance.6 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impacts and Outcome \n \n11.  The TA supports the key operational priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 by strengthening \ngovernance  and  institutional  capacity,  and  implementing  anticorruption  measures  in  ADB \nprojects and programs. It will strengthen subregional initiatives and facilitate knowledge sharing \nand collaboration.7 \n \n12.  The TA  is  aligned  with  the following  impacts:  (i)  competitive  markets  and  efficient, \neffective, accountable, and transparent public administration increased; (ii) anticorruption efforts \nincreased on a case-by-case basis and the quality of dialogue on governance issues improved; \nand (iii) adherence to the highest ethical standards of ADB projects and staff ensured.8 \n \n13.  The TA will have the following outcome: capacity of ADB stakeholders to prevent and \ndetect integrity violations increased.9 \n \n                                                \n5  ADB/OECD. Anti-Corruption Initiative for Asia-Pacific.  \n6  The 31 members of the Anticorruption Initiative are Afghanistan; Australia; Bangladesh; Bhutan; Cambodia; the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China; the Cook Islands; Fiji; Hong Kong, China; India; Indonesia; Japan; Kazakhstan; the \nRepublic of Korea; Kyrgyz Republic; Macao, China; Malaysia; Mongolia; Nepal; Pakistan; Palau; Papua New \nGuinea; the Philippines; Samoa; Singapore; Solomon Islands; Sri Lanka; Thailand; Timor-Leste; Vanuatu; and Viet \nNam. \n7  ADB. 2018.

OAI leads ADB\u2019s outreach program on integrity initiatives through training, workshops, \nawareness campaigns, and knowledge products. This TA will increase the awareness and \nimprove the skills of ADB\u2019s stakeholders in identifying and preventing corruption, fraud, and \nother  integrity  violations.  Specifically,  they  will  understand  the  requirements  of  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption  Policy  and  guidelines,  and  how  this  is  applied  to  project  preparation, \nimplementation, and administration. The TA will assist DMCs in promoting good governance \nand improving anticorruption mechanisms. \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n15.  The TA will support the following outputs:10 \n \na.  Capacity of the public sector in resolving integrity issues increased. To ensure \nthe widest possible impact, training will be provided online through e-learning. Online \ntraining will reach more people, and can have flexible content and cater to specific \nneeds by combining modules on various topics, such as the fundamentals of integrity \nand  anticorruption,  due  diligence  approaches,  techniques  for  effective  internal \ncontrols,  and  mitigating  corruption  in  procurement.  The  e-learning  courses  will \nconsist of a set of self-study training modules, which can be taken depending on the \nneeds and skill level of the participants. The modules will use a \u201cgraduation\u201d system, \nwhere more advanced modules can only be taken following the successful passing \nof a prerequisite (a more basic module). The self-study is complimented by online \nchat sessions and webinars. The detailed structure and content of the modules will \nbe finalized with the help of an experienced consultant to be recruited under the TA. \n \nb.  Oversight  and  management  of  ADB  loans  and  grants  improved.  Tailored \nworkshops will be developed to address specific country, sector, and/or stakeholder \nneeds, which will be identified by OAI based on the integrity country risk profiles of \nDMCs.11 Development and implementation of these workshops will take place in \nconsultation with ADB\u2019s operations departments. To maximize effectiveness, the \nworkshops may be linked to PPRRs, either as preparation for the review or to \naddress  the  PPRR  recommendations  and  support  implementation  of  the \nrecommendations  from  the  country  and/or  sector  governance  risk  assessments, \nprovided  these  are  within  the  TA  scope.  The  focus  will  be  on  high-risk  areas \nidentified by PPRRs and related to procurement, financial management, and asset \nmanagement. Train-the-trainer programs will be considered. \n \nc.  Anticorruption policies improved and best practices provided. ADB will continue \nto  support  regional meetings  and  conferences  under  the  Anticorruption  Initiative \n(footnote 5). \n \nd.  These outputs will result in increased knowledge and capacity of stakeholders of \nADB-financed projects and relevant government agencies to prevent and detect \nintegrity  violations  in  public  services.  The  outputs  respond  to  the  needs  of \nstakeholders as expressed during multiple consultations over the last 5 years and \nconfirmed through training course exit questionnaires. \n                                                \n10 Knowledge products such as handbooks, guidelines and thematic studies will be prepared as training materials \nunder the three outputs. All documents and training materials will be published digitally. \n11 OAI is in the process of developing country integrity risk profiles of 11 countries where two or more PPRRs have \nbeen carried out in the last 10 years. \n ", "4 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $1 million which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix \n2. The governments will provide counterpart support in the form of in-kind contributions, which \nmay vary from country to country. This will be agreed with ADB during preparation of specific \nworkshops and conferences. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  ADB  will  administer  the  TA.  OAI  will  select,  supervise,  and  evaluate  consultants; \norganize workshops; and provide staff to act as resource persons in the workshops. ADB will \nengage consultants and carry out procurement following the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as \namended from time to time) and its associated project administration instructions and/or staff \ninstructions. \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented through a consulting firm and individual consultants. The \nconsulting firm will be recruited to deliver the e-learning modules (output 1) using quality-based \nselection and a performance-based terms of reference.12 Individual consultants will be recruited \nto assist OAI with the delivery of the workshops and conferences (outputs 2 and 3) through \nlogistic support and resource speakers. \n \n19.  The terms of references for the firm and the individual consultant to assist with TA \nmanagement  are  in  Appendix  3.13 The  terms  of  references  for  individual  consultants  and \nresource persons will be prepared as TA implementation progresses and specific requirements \nare identified. \n \n20.  It is expected that five or six workshops will be organized annually. Following approval of \nthe TA and mobilization of the consultants, OAI will hold discussions with regional departments \nto determine the scope of the outputs and the detailed implementation arrangements, including \nthe possibility to set up an implementation team headed by OAI, including representatives from \nthe interested regional departments. This team will decide on selection criteria and focus areas \nfor the training and workshops. \n \n21.  The TA will finance travel and per diem of ADB staff to act as resource speakers. \n \n22.
