During the 1997 midyear review of the Country Program for the People's\nRepublic of China (PRC), the Government requested Bank technical assistance (TA) for the\ndevelopment of institutional capacity to promote corporatization, leasing, and securitization to\nattract greater private sector participation in the road sector.' A Fact-finding Mission visited the\nPRC from 29 July to 5 August 1997 and discussed with Government officials the objective,\nscope, costs, implementation arrangements, and terms of reference for the TA2. This paper is\nbased on the Mission's findings and the agreements reached with the Government.\nII.\t BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. To cope with the increasing road transport demand, the PRC Government\nlaunched a 30-year plan in 1991 to build the 35,000 kilometers (km) National Trunk Highway\nSystem (NTHS) of high-quality interprovincial highways. Development of NTHS is under the\noverall direction of the Ministry of Communications (MOC). NTHS will be supported by the\ncomplementary development of provincial, county, and village access roads. The plan will not\nonly connect all provincial capitals and major cities but also provide less-developed counties\nand poorer communities in the influence area of NTHS with access to the economic\nmainstream. The ongoing Ninth Five-year Plan (1996-2000) includes the construction of\n130,000 km of new roads that will extend the road network to 1.3 million km. This new\nconstruction includes more than 10,000 km of expressways and other high-grade highways.\n3. This ambitious program cannot be financed only from traditional sources, i.e.,\nGovernment budget, and multilateral and bilateral aid sources. Between 1998 and 2020, over\n$150 billion of investments will be needed to complete NTHS. Only about half of the\nconstruction and maintenance costs will be financed through user charges and fees. The\nbalance will need to be raised through other sources including the private sector. To meet the\nNinth Five-year Plan highway construction target, more than $20 billion in private investment in\nhighway projects, needs to be mobilized. The Government is exploring innovative financing\ntechniques, such as leasing and securitization to generate new sources of capital to fill the\nfinancing gap.\n4. To facilitate the leasing and securitization process, the provincial governments\nfirst need to set up corporations independent from the provincial communications departments.\nWhile some of the provincial governments have established corporations to construct, operate,\nand maintain expressways, others still need to move in this direction. The corporatization\nprocess also needs to be reviewed and rationalized to make corporations more efficient and\nfinancially sound, and foster greater private sector participation through leasing or\nsecuritization.\nThe term \"corporatization\", as used in this document, refers to the establishment of an entity with an\nindependent juridical status and responsible for the provision of road infrastructure, including development\nand financing of new facilities, management and operations of both new and existing facilities, and\ncollection of charges from the users of such facilities. The term \"leasing\" refers to the transfer of operating\nrights (including collection of user charges) from the owner and operator of road infrastructure facilities to\nan operating company for a fixed period of time in exchange for lease payment(s). The term \"securitization\"\nrefers to the process of raising funds through the issuance of either shares or bonds by the issuing\ncompany on local or foreign stock exchanges and markets.\nThe TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities, Internet edition, in August 1997.", "2\n5. In August 1996, the Zhuhai Highway Company Limited entered into a master\nlease agreement to operate and manage the Zhuhai Highway in Guangdong Province.'\nLeasing negotiations are being conducted for several other highways in the country, including\nthe Shenyang to Dalian Expressway in Liaoning Province. MOC issued a Ministerial Order on\nManagerial Regulations for Transfer of Highway Operating Rights with Compensation in\nOctober 1996. To facilitate the leasing practice nationwide, and promote transparency and fair\ncompetition, guidelines on leasing procedures need to be developed taking into account the\nexisting Ministerial Order and other relevant regulations. As this Order also applies to highways\nthat were financed using loans from international lending institutions, the guidelines need to\nexamine various aspects of the leasing of highways financed by these institutions.\n6. The first examples of securitization in the PRC road sector were the listing of the\nGuangdong Provincial Expressway Development Company and the Anhui Expressway\nCompany, on the Shenzhen and Hong Kong Stock Exchanges, respectively, during the second\nhalf of 1996. In 1997, the Jiangsu, Shenzhen, and Zhejiang Expressway Companies were\nsuccessfully listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Several other expressways, including\nthe World Bank-financed Chengdu-Chongqing and Jinan-Qingdao expressways, are also\ncandidates for listing on the Shanghai, Shenzhen, or Hong Kong Stock Exchanges. The listing\nof the Anhui and Guangdong companies was reviewed under TA No. 2409-PRC and\nrecommendations were made to improve the listing process . 2 The latest experiences of\nexpressway listing have to be evaluated to firm up guidelines for securitization in the road\nsector. The policies of funding agencies and the State Planning Commission (SPC) regarding\naccelerated repayment of loans need also to be reviewed prior to the finalization of the\nguidelines for securitization.\n7. The Bank's country operational strategy for the PRC focuses on improving\neconomic efficiency, promoting growth to reduce poverty in poor inland provinces, and\nimproving environmental protection and natural resources management. Because of the\nimportant role of flexible and efficient road transport in a market economy, the Bank is\nsupporting the Government's efforts to construct priority sections of NTHS. The Bank's agenda\nfor policy dialogue in the road sector has focused on commercializing highway operations,\nmobilizing private sector resources, and improving road safety and highway design standards.3\nFinancing arrangements of this agreement were studied under TA No. 2409-PRC: Appraisal Methodologies\nand Restructuring of Highway Financing in Hebei Province, for $740,000, approved on 28 September 1995,\ncompleted in November 1997.\nz\t\nRecommendations were also made under TA No. 2512-PRC Integration of Securities Markets, for $600,000,\napproved on 27 December 1995, completed in May 1997,\n3 Supporting TAs include, (i) TA No. 1724-PRC: Institutional Strengthening for Highway Operation and\nManagement Improvement, for $500,000, approved on 2 July 1992; (ii) TA No. 1940-PRC: Efficiency\nImprovement In Road Transport, for $550,000, approved on 25 August 11993; (iii) TA No. 1972-PRC:Po/icy\nand Institutional Support in the Road Sector, for $1,200,000, approved on 9 November 1993; (iv) TA No.\n1975-PRC-Policies for Strategic Development of Transport and Communications Infrastructure, for\n$100,000, approved on 11 November 1993; (v) TA No. 2177-PRC: Preparation of  a Road Safety Program,\nfor $600,000, approved on 29 September 1994; (vi) TA No. 2178-PRC: Provincial Highway Network\nPlanning, for $600,000, approved on 29 September 1994; (vii) TA No. 2409-PRC: Appraisal Methodologies\nand Restructuring of Highway Financing in Hebei Province, for $740,000, approved on 28 September 1995;\n(viii)TA No. 2573-PRC:Review of Highway Design Standards, for $420,000, approved on 24 May 1996; and\n(ix) TA No. 2649-PRC:Facilitating the Build-Operate-Transfer Modality in the Highway Sector, for\n$1,100,000, approved on 27 September 1996.", "3\nIII.\t THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objective\n8. The objective of the TA is to help develop institutional capacity to promote\ncorporatization, leasing and securitization (CLS) in the road sector to attract private sector\nparticipation in the construction, management, and operation of bridges, expressways, and\nother roads in the PRC. The TA framework is given in Appendix 1.\nB.\t Scope\n9. To achieve the objective, the TA consultants will (i) review studies, experiences,\npractices, rules, and regulations ' relevant to the various CLS modalities, and identify\ninstitutional, regulatory, and legal Issues impeding the use of these modalities in PRC; (ii)\nevaluate the potential of each of the CLS modalities to attract private sector participation in the\nroad sector; (iii) determine the core requirements for the application of each of the CLS\nmodalities; (iv) develop guidelines including operational and financial criteria to be used for\neach of the CLS modalities; (v) make recommendations on needed changes in legislation,\ninstitutional framework, and regulatory mechanism to facilitate the CLS modalities; (vi) assist the\nGovernment in applying the guidelines to selected cases; (vii) develop performance evaluation\nand monitoring mechanisms for each of the CLS modalities; and (viii) conduct two workshops to\ndisseminate and discuss the findings of the TA.\nC.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n10. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,470,000 equivalent, including a\nforeign exchange component of $670,000 and a local cost component of $800,000 equivalent.\nThe Government has requested the Bank to provide $1,000,000 equivalent to cover the entire\nforeign exchange cost and a portion of the local currency costs amounting to $330,000\nequivalent (see Appendix 2 for cost estimates). The TA will be financed by the Bank on a grant\nbasis from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan.\nD.\t Implementation Arrangements\n11. The TA will be conducted in three phases. Under the first phase, relevant\ninformation on the CLS modalities in the road sector will be reviewed.' In consultation with the\nnational and provincial authorities, and based on the findings and recommendations of TA No.\n2409-PRC, two case studies for securitization will be identified, at the entity-level or project-\nlevel. An inception report including the proposed case studies will be produced at the end of\nthe first phase, which will cover a period of one month. One of the two identified case studies\nThe review will include findings of (i) TA No. 2409-PRC:Appraisai Methodologies and Restructuring of\nHighway Financing in Hebei Province, for $740,000, approved on 28 September 1995; (ii) TA No. 1972-\nPRC:Policy and Institutional Support in the Road Sector, for $1.2 million, approved on 9 November 1993;\n(iii)TA No. 2512-PRC: Integration of Securities Markets; for $600,000, approved on 27 December 1995; and\n(iv) TA No. 2649-PRC: Facilitating the Build-Operate-Transfer Modality in the Highway Sector. for $1 1\nmillion: approved on 27 September 1996, as well as the experience gained under the Investment No 7110-\nREG:Asian Securitization and Infrastructure Assurance Ltd., for $20.0 million, approved on 5 September\n1995.", "4\nfor securitization will be selected at the first tripartite meeting and will be implemented taking\ninto account the findings and recommendations of TA No. 2409-PRC as preliminary guidelines.\n12. During the second phase, while assisting the Government in implementing the\nselected securitization case study, the TA will examine and analyze recent CLS experiences in\nthe PRC, as well as relevant experience in other countries. The TA will review the laws and\nregulations that impact on the CLS modalities, in particular the Highway Law, draft Securities\nLaw, Contract Laws, and Company Law. The TA will identify the needed institutional,\nregulatory, legal and financial reforms, at the national and provincial levels, and develop\nguidelines, procedures, and operational and financial criteria to promote CLS in the road\nsector.2 In consultation with the national and provincial authorities, two case studies each for\ncorporatization and for leasing will be identified, either at the project-level or entity-level. The\nentity could be a Government department, an existing corporation, or a company covering the\noperation and development of one or several toll bridges and/or expressways and other roads.\nAn interim report describing the guidelines, procedures, and operational and financial criteria for\napplication of CLS; the progress of implementing the securitization case study; and the\nproposed case studies for corporatization and leasing will be produced at the end of the second\nphase, which will cover a period of four months. A workshop, attended by representatives from\nSPC, MOC, other national and provincial agencies concerned, and the Bank, will be conducted\nto discuss the findings of Phase II and to select a case study for corporatization and another for\nleasing.\n13. During the third phase of the TA, the consultants will assist the Government in\nimplementing the corporatization and leasing of the selected entities by applying the relevant\nCLS guidelines, while continuing the implementation of the securitization case study. The\nexperience gained from the implementation of the CLS modalities to the case studies will be\nused to refine and finalize the guidelines, procedures, and criteria for CLS. Recommendations\non the institutional framework and regulatory mechanisms needed to enforce the application of\nCLS modalities will also be formulated. A draft final report containing the consultants'\nrecommendations will be produced at the end of the third phase, which is expected to cover a\nperiod of seven months. The draft final report will be discussed in a second workshop and\nfinalized within two months after taking into account the comments made and the discussions\nheld at this workshop.\n14. SPC will be the Executing Agency for the TA. Suitable counterpart staff from\nSPC will be assigned to work with the TA consultants on a day-to-day basis, and to coordinate\nactivities under the TA. An advisory committee will be established to provide guidance on\ninterministerial issues related to the TA. The committee will comprise senior officials from SPC,\nMOC, People's Bank of China, State Economic and Trade Commission, China Securities\nRegulatory Commission, and other Government agencies concerned. For the implementation\nof case studies, Project implementation units will be established in the provinces concerned.\nEach unit will comprise representatives from the provincial planning commission,\ncommunications department, finance bureau, and other provincial agencies concerned; and\nwill work under the supervision of SPC. SPC will ensure coordination between the different\nThe implementation of the securitization case will not include the involvement and fees of the investment\nbanker or securities company to help with share listing or the bond issue on the market. The TA\nconsultants will assist the entity in selecting the investment banker or securities company and act as\nadvisers to the entity thereafter.\nz\t The institutional, regulatory, legal and financial reforms and preliminary guidelines proposed under TA No.\n2409-PRC will be reviewed at this stage and included in the CLS guidelines.", "5\nagencies and provide the consultants with office accommodation (suitably furnished and\nequipped); translation and interpretation services; communications facilities; and all documents,\ndata, statistics, maps and information relevant to the TA. SPC will finance all participant-related\nexpenses for the two workshops. Expenses related to presentation equipment, training\nmaterials, and lecturers will be borne by the TA.\n15. The TA will require a total of about 81 person-months of consulting services,\nincluding about 19 person-months of international consulting services and 62 person-months of\ndomestic consulting services. Outline terms of reference are given in Appendix 3. The\ninternationally recruited consultants will have expertise in (i) private sector infrastructure\nfinancing including public listing, (ii) legal aspects of infrastructure financing, (iii) financial\nanalysis and accounting, (iv) expressway operations and management, and (v) capacity\nbuilding, training, and conduct of workshops. The internationally recruited consultants will be\nencouraged to utilize domestic consultants in the fields of (i) financial analysis and accounting,\n(ii) highway management and administration, (iii) legal aspects of CLS modalities, (iv) highway\noperation and maintenance, and (v) conduct of workshops. A firm of international consultants,\nin association with domestic consultants, will be selected and engaged in accordance with the\nBank's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.\n16. The TA will be implemented over a period of about 14 months. The consultants\nare expected to be fielded by April 1998, and the major field work will be carried out over a\nperiod of 12 months, up to the submission of the draft final report. Three tripartite meetings\ninvolving representatives from the Government, the Bank, and the consultants will be held to\ndiscuss the findings of the inception report, the interim report and the draft final report,\nexpected at the end of the first, fifth, and twelfth month of the TA. The workshops will be\nconducted together with the second and third tripartite meetings. The final report will be\nsubmitted before the end of the fourteenth month of the TA.\nIV.\t THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n17. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved\nthe provision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, to the Government of the People's\nRepublic of China in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 for the purpose of\nCorporatization, Leasing, and Securitization in the Road Sector and hereby reports such action\nto the Board.", "TA FRAMEWORK\n\t \t\nProject Summary Targets Monitoring Mechanisms\t Major Assumptions/Risks\n1.

During the 1997 midyear review of the Country Program for the People's\nRepublic of China (PRC), the Government requested Bank technical assistance (TA) for the\ndevelopment of institutional capacity to promote corporatization, leasing, and securitization to\nattract greater private sector participation in the road sector.' A Fact-finding Mission visited the\nPRC from 29 July to 5 August 1997 and discussed with Government officials the objective,\nscope, costs, implementation arrangements, and terms of reference for the TA2. This paper is\nbased on the Mission's findings and the agreements reached with the Government.\nII.\t BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. To cope with the increasing road transport demand, the PRC Government\nlaunched a 30-year plan in 1991 to build the 35,000 kilometers (km) National Trunk Highway\nSystem (NTHS) of high-quality interprovincial highways. Development of NTHS is under the\noverall direction of the Ministry of Communications (MOC). NTHS will be supported by the\ncomplementary development of provincial, county, and village access roads. The plan will not\nonly connect all provincial capitals and major cities but also provide less-developed counties\nand poorer communities in the influence area of NTHS with access to the economic\nmainstream. The ongoing Ninth Five-year Plan (1996-2000) includes the construction of\n130,000 km of new roads that will extend the road network to 1.3 million km. This new\nconstruction includes more than 10,000 km of expressways and other high-grade highways.\n3. This ambitious program cannot be financed only from traditional sources, i.e.,\nGovernment budget, and multilateral and bilateral aid sources. Between 1998 and 2020, over\n$150 billion of investments will be needed to complete NTHS. Only about half of the\nconstruction and maintenance costs will be financed through user charges and fees. The\nbalance will need to be raised through other sources including the private sector. To meet the\nNinth Five-year Plan highway construction target, more than $20 billion in private investment in\nhighway projects, needs to be mobilized. The Government is exploring innovative financing\ntechniques, such as leasing and securitization to generate new sources of capital to fill the\nfinancing gap.\n4. To facilitate the leasing and securitization process, the provincial governments\nfirst need to set up corporations independent from the provincial communications departments.\nWhile some of the provincial governments have established corporations to construct, operate,\nand maintain expressways, others still need to move in this direction. The corporatization\nprocess also needs to be reviewed and rationalized to make corporations more efficient and\nfinancially sound, and foster greater private sector participation through leasing or\nsecuritization.\nThe term \"corporatization\", as used in this document, refers to the establishment of an entity with an\nindependent juridical status and responsible for the provision of road infrastructure, including development\nand financing of new facilities, management and operations of both new and existing facilities, and\ncollection of charges from the users of such facilities. The term \"leasing\" refers to the transfer of operating\nrights (including collection of user charges) from the owner and operator of road infrastructure facilities to\nan operating company for a fixed period of time in exchange for lease payment(s). The term \"securitization\"\nrefers to the process of raising funds through the issuance of either shares or bonds by the issuing\ncompany on local or foreign stock exchanges and markets.\nThe TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities, Internet edition, in August 1997.", "2\n5. In August 1996, the Zhuhai Highway Company Limited entered into a master\nlease agreement to operate and manage the Zhuhai Highway in Guangdong Province.'\nLeasing negotiations are being conducted for several other highways in the country, including\nthe Shenyang to Dalian Expressway in Liaoning Province. MOC issued a Ministerial Order on\nManagerial Regulations for Transfer of Highway Operating Rights with Compensation in\nOctober 1996. To facilitate the leasing practice nationwide, and promote transparency and fair\ncompetition, guidelines on leasing procedures need to be developed taking into account the\nexisting Ministerial Order and other relevant regulations. As this Order also applies to highways\nthat were financed using loans from international lending institutions, the guidelines need to\nexamine various aspects of the leasing of highways financed by these institutions.\n6. The first examples of securitization in the PRC road sector were the listing of the\nGuangdong Provincial Expressway Development Company and the Anhui Expressway\nCompany, on the Shenzhen and Hong Kong Stock Exchanges, respectively, during the second\nhalf of 1996. In 1997, the Jiangsu, Shenzhen, and Zhejiang Expressway Companies were\nsuccessfully listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Several other expressways, including\nthe World Bank-financed Chengdu-Chongqing and Jinan-Qingdao expressways, are also\ncandidates for listing on the Shanghai, Shenzhen, or Hong Kong Stock Exchanges. The listing\nof the Anhui and Guangdong companies was reviewed under TA No. 2409-PRC and\nrecommendations were made to improve the listing process . 2 The latest experiences of\nexpressway listing have to be evaluated to firm up guidelines for securitization in the road\nsector. The policies of funding agencies and the State Planning Commission (SPC) regarding\naccelerated repayment of loans need also to be reviewed prior to the finalization of the\nguidelines for securitization.\n7. The Bank's country operational strategy for the PRC focuses on improving\neconomic efficiency, promoting growth to reduce poverty in poor inland provinces, and\nimproving environmental protection and natural resources management. Because of the\nimportant role of flexible and efficient road transport in a market economy, the Bank is\nsupporting the Government's efforts to construct priority sections of NTHS. The Bank's agenda\nfor policy dialogue in the road sector has focused on commercializing highway operations,\nmobilizing private sector resources, and improving road safety and highway design standards.3\nFinancing arrangements of this agreement were studied under TA No. 2409-PRC: Appraisal Methodologies\nand Restructuring of Highway Financing in Hebei Province, for $740,000, approved on 28 September 1995,\ncompleted in November 1997.\nz\t\nRecommendations were also made under TA No. 2512-PRC Integration of Securities Markets, for $600,000,\napproved on 27 December 1995, completed in May 1997,\n3 Supporting TAs include, (i) TA No. 1724-PRC: Institutional Strengthening for Highway Operation and\nManagement Improvement, for $500,000, approved on 2 July 1992; (ii) TA No. 1940-PRC: Efficiency\nImprovement In Road Transport, for $550,000, approved on 25 August 11993; (iii) TA No. 1972-PRC:Po/icy\nand Institutional Support in the Road Sector, for $1,200,000, approved on 9 November 1993; (iv) TA No.\n1975-PRC-Policies for Strategic Development of Transport and Communications Infrastructure, for\n$100,000, approved on 11 November 1993; (v) TA No. 2177-PRC: Preparation of  a Road Safety Program,\nfor $600,000, approved on 29 September 1994; (vi) TA No. 2178-PRC: Provincial Highway Network\nPlanning, for $600,000, approved on 29 September 1994; (vii) TA No. 2409-PRC: Appraisal Methodologies\nand Restructuring of Highway Financing in Hebei Province, for $740,000, approved on 28 September 1995;\n(viii)TA No. 2573-PRC:Review of Highway Design Standards, for $420,000, approved on 24 May 1996; and\n(ix) TA No. 2649-PRC:Facilitating the Build-Operate-Transfer Modality in the Highway Sector, for\n$1,100,000, approved on 27 September 1996.", "3\nIII.\t THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objective\n8. The objective of the TA is to help develop institutional capacity to promote\ncorporatization, leasing and securitization (CLS) in the road sector to attract private sector\nparticipation in the construction, management, and operation of bridges, expressways, and\nother roads in the PRC. The TA framework is given in Appendix 1.\nB.\t Scope\n9. To achieve the objective, the TA consultants will (i) review studies, experiences,\npractices, rules, and regulations ' relevant to the various CLS modalities, and identify\ninstitutional, regulatory, and legal Issues impeding the use of these modalities in PRC; (ii)\nevaluate the potential of each of the CLS modalities to attract private sector participation in the\nroad sector; (iii) determine the core requirements for the application of each of the CLS\nmodalities; (iv) develop guidelines including operational and financial criteria to be used for\neach of the CLS modalities; (v) make recommendations on needed changes in legislation,\ninstitutional framework, and regulatory mechanism to facilitate the CLS modalities; (vi) assist the\nGovernment in applying the guidelines to selected cases; (vii) develop performance evaluation\nand monitoring mechanisms for each of the CLS modalities; and (viii) conduct two workshops to\ndisseminate and discuss the findings of the TA.\nC.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n10. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,470,000 equivalent, including a\nforeign exchange component of $670,000 and a local cost component of $800,000 equivalent.\nThe Government has requested the Bank to provide $1,000,000 equivalent to cover the entire\nforeign exchange cost and a portion of the local currency costs amounting to $330,000\nequivalent (see Appendix 2 for cost estimates). The TA will be financed by the Bank on a grant\nbasis from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan.\nD.\t Implementation Arrangements\n11. The TA will be conducted in three phases. Under the first phase, relevant\ninformation on the CLS modalities in the road sector will be reviewed.' In consultation with the\nnational and provincial authorities, and based on the findings and recommendations of TA No.\n2409-PRC, two case studies for securitization will be identified, at the entity-level or project-\nlevel. An inception report including the proposed case studies will be produced at the end of\nthe first phase, which will cover a period of one month. One of the two identified case studies\nThe review will include findings of (i) TA No. 2409-PRC:Appraisai Methodologies and Restructuring of\nHighway Financing in Hebei Province, for $740,000, approved on 28 September 1995; (ii) TA No. 1972-\nPRC:Policy and Institutional Support in the Road Sector, for $1.2 million, approved on 9 November 1993;\n(iii)TA No. 2512-PRC: Integration of Securities Markets; for $600,000, approved on 27 December 1995; and\n(iv) TA No. 2649-PRC: Facilitating the Build-Operate-Transfer Modality in the Highway Sector. for $1 1\nmillion: approved on 27 September 1996, as well as the experience gained under the Investment No 7110-\nREG:Asian Securitization and Infrastructure Assurance Ltd., for $20.0 million, approved on 5 September\n1995.", "4\nfor securitization will be selected at the first tripartite meeting and will be implemented taking\ninto account the findings and recommendations of TA No. 2409-PRC as preliminary guidelines.\n12. During the second phase, while assisting the Government in implementing the\nselected securitization case study, the TA will examine and analyze recent CLS experiences in\nthe PRC, as well as relevant experience in other countries. The TA will review the laws and\nregulations that impact on the CLS modalities, in particular the Highway Law, draft Securities\nLaw, Contract Laws, and Company Law. The TA will identify the needed institutional,\nregulatory, legal and financial reforms, at the national and provincial levels, and develop\nguidelines, procedures, and operational and financial criteria to promote CLS in the road\nsector.2 In consultation with the national and provincial authorities, two case studies each for\ncorporatization and for leasing will be identified, either at the project-level or entity-level. The\nentity could be a Government department, an existing corporation, or a company covering the\noperation and development of one or several toll bridges and/or expressways and other roads.\nAn interim report describing the guidelines, procedures, and operational and financial criteria for\napplication of CLS; the progress of implementing the securitization case study; and the\nproposed case studies for corporatization and leasing will be produced at the end of the second\nphase, which will cover a period of four months. A workshop, attended by representatives from\nSPC, MOC, other national and provincial agencies concerned, and the Bank, will be conducted\nto discuss the findings of Phase II and to select a case study for corporatization and another for\nleasing.\n13. During the third phase of the TA, the consultants will assist the Government in\nimplementing the corporatization and leasing of the selected entities by applying the relevant\nCLS guidelines, while continuing the implementation of the securitization case study. The\nexperience gained from the implementation of the CLS modalities to the case studies will be\nused to refine and finalize the guidelines, procedures, and criteria for CLS. Recommendations\non the institutional framework and regulatory mechanisms needed to enforce the application of\nCLS modalities will also be formulated. A draft final report containing the consultants'\nrecommendations will be produced at the end of the third phase, which is expected to cover a\nperiod of seven months. The draft final report will be discussed in a second workshop and\nfinalized within two months after taking into account the comments made and the discussions\nheld at this workshop.\n14. SPC will be the Executing Agency for the TA. Suitable counterpart staff from\nSPC will be assigned to work with the TA consultants on a day-to-day basis, and to coordinate\nactivities under the TA. An advisory committee will be established to provide guidance on\ninterministerial issues related to the TA. The committee will comprise senior officials from SPC,\nMOC, People's Bank of China, State Economic and Trade Commission, China Securities\nRegulatory Commission, and other Government agencies concerned. For the implementation\nof case studies, Project implementation units will be established in the provinces concerned.\nEach unit will comprise representatives from the provincial planning commission,\ncommunications department, finance bureau, and other provincial agencies concerned; and\nwill work under the supervision of SPC. SPC will ensure coordination between the different\nThe implementation of the securitization case will not include the involvement and fees of the investment\nbanker or securities company to help with share listing or the bond issue on the market. The TA\nconsultants will assist the entity in selecting the investment banker or securities company and act as\nadvisers to the entity thereafter.\nz\t The institutional, regulatory, legal and financial reforms and preliminary guidelines proposed under TA No.\n2409-PRC will be reviewed at this stage and included in the CLS guidelines.", "5\nagencies and provide the consultants with office accommodation (suitably furnished and\nequipped); translation and interpretation services; communications facilities; and all documents,\ndata, statistics, maps and information relevant to the TA. SPC will finance all participant-related\nexpenses for the two workshops. Expenses related to presentation equipment, training\nmaterials, and lecturers will be borne by the TA.\n15. The TA will require a total of about 81 person-months of consulting services,\nincluding about 19 person-months of international consulting services and 62 person-months of\ndomestic consulting services. Outline terms of reference are given in Appendix 3. The\ninternationally recruited consultants will have expertise in (i) private sector infrastructure\nfinancing including public listing, (ii) legal aspects of infrastructure financing, (iii) financial\nanalysis and accounting, (iv) expressway operations and management, and (v) capacity\nbuilding, training, and conduct of workshops. The internationally recruited consultants will be\nencouraged to utilize domestic consultants in the fields of (i) financial analysis and accounting,\n(ii) highway management and administration, (iii) legal aspects of CLS modalities, (iv) highway\noperation and maintenance, and (v) conduct of workshops. A firm of international consultants,\nin association with domestic consultants, will be selected and engaged in accordance with the\nBank's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.\n16. The TA will be implemented over a period of about 14 months. The consultants\nare expected to be fielded by April 1998, and the major field work will be carried out over a\nperiod of 12 months, up to the submission of the draft final report. Three tripartite meetings\ninvolving representatives from the Government, the Bank, and the consultants will be held to\ndiscuss the findings of the inception report, the interim report and the draft final report,\nexpected at the end of the first, fifth, and twelfth month of the TA. The workshops will be\nconducted together with the second and third tripartite meetings.
