INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will strengthen the implementation \nof the Safeguard Policy Statement (SPS) (2009) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and \nsupport  operational  priority  six  of  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030  on  strengthening  governance  and \ninstitutional capacity (in relation to upholding safeguards).1 The TA will develop the capacity of \nexecuting agencies and implementing agencies for ADB projects to implement environmental and \nsocial safeguards through enhanced guidance; tools; good practice notes; training materials; and \nsafeguard management and reporting systems, including integrated environmental and social \nassessment to address crosscutting thematic issues.2 The TA was endorsed in the corporate \npriority framework meeting in November 2018 and is included in the ADB Management-approved \n2019 results-based work plan of the Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department \n(SDCC).3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Since ADB\u2019s SPS was adopted in 2009, consideration of safeguard issues in ADB projects \nhas  been  strengthened.  However,  implementation  gaps  remain.  In  2014  and  2016,  ADB\u2019s \nIndependent Evaluation Department (IED) undertook an evaluation of the SPS, which concluded \nthat safeguards implementation had improved, but still needed to be strengthened.4 The capacity \nof executing agencies and implementing agencies, their consultants, and their contractors to \nadequately assess the environmental and social impacts and risks of ADB projects, and to plan \nand manage safeguards implementation, is often insufficient, requiring ADB to provide extensive \nsafeguard staff and consultant support during processing and implementation. IED also identified \nthat more attention needs to be given to the quality and focus of safeguard documentation, project \nreadiness for safeguards implementation, and monitoring and supervision. Better consideration \nof health and safety risks, livelihood restoration, grievance redress, and financial intermediaries \nis also needed.5 ADB has also been supporting the use of country safeguard systems in India, \nIndonesia, and Sri Lanka. Findings show that, while policy and legislation may be strong, there is \noften weak capacity among project developers and government regulators for implementation \nand enforcement of regulations. \n \n3.  Persistent challenges and emerging issues related to the implementation of ADB\u2019s SPS \nneed to be addressed. Technical assessments (e.g., biodiversity or noise assessments) need to \nbe more robust, particularly for projects having high environmental or social risk. In addition, \nprojects need to consider the interlinkages between environment and social safeguards and \nrelated issues (including climate change, disaster risk, gender, and core labor standards) through \nintegrated assessment approaches.6 More use is being made of project modalities that require \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2019.

Manila. \n2  Includes private sector borrowers or clients in the case of nonsovereign operations. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 23 September 2019. \n4  IED. 2014. Corporate Evaluation Study: Safeguards Operational Review\u2014ADB Processes, Portfolio, Country \nSystems, and Financial Intermediaries. Manila: ADB; and IED. 2016. Thematic Evaluation Study: Real-Time \nEvaluation of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Implementation Experience Based on Selected Case Studies. Manila: ADB. An \nongoing IED evaluation study, due for completion in 2020, is reviewing the SPS\u2019s effectiveness, taking changes at \nother international finance institutions into account. \n5  IED  identified  a  need  to  improve  the  formulation  and  implementation  of  livelihood  restoration  programs, \nrecommending that they be incorporated into resettlement plans. \n6  Consideration needs to be given to non-land acquisition social impacts that fall between environmental and social \nsafeguards; and proactive environment, climate change, gender, and social development agendas as related to \n \n ", "2 \ndifferent approaches in assessing and managing safeguards compared with project loans; these \ninclude financial intermediaries, general corporate finance, policy-based loans, and results-based \nloans. Private sector operations are also increasingly using financing modalities that were not \noriginally anticipated by the SPS. The size of the ADB portfolio has also increased and become \nmore diverse, with more projects being approved in non-infrastructure sectors such as health and \neducation. \n \n4.  The  cumulative  impact  of  these  changes  has  made  safeguards  implementation \nincreasingly challenging for executing and implementing agencies as well as for consultants, \ncontractors,  and  other  parties  involved  in  safeguards  implementation. 7  For  example, \nimplementation delays because of project readiness are a key challenge, especially in relation to \nland acquisition and resettlement.8 Further, monitoring of safeguards performance and reporting \nat the executing and implementing agency level remains weak and does not provide critical \nsafeguards information that would help developing member countries (DMCs) and ADB identify \nproject  portfolio-level  risks  early  on,  and  enable  limited  safeguards  resources  to  be  more \neffectively targeted toward their management. \n \n5.  There are also emerging vulnerabilities and risks that need to be addressed, including \nissues related to labor; sexual abuse, exploitation, and harassment; and climate change mitigation \nand adaptation. Stakeholder engagement needs to be inclusive and include engagement with \npeople with disabilities and with the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, plus community. Some \nof these issues are already being addressed by thematic groups but addressing them at the \nproject level often falls to those also responsible for safeguards assessment. These issues are \npartly covered by SPS requirements, but they are now being included in safeguard policies of \ninternational finance institutions (IFIs), such as the World Bank\u2019s Environmental and Social \nFramework. 9  Stakeholders,  including  cofinanciers  with  their  own  safeguard  policies,  are \nincreasingly asking how ADB addresses these issues. \n \n6.  Several  good  and  innovative  approaches  to  strengthening  capacity  for  safeguards \nimplementation at the project and country levels exist in ADB. For example, ADB\u2019s South Asia \nDepartment has developed a cloud-based safeguard monitoring system to monitor and track its \nportfolio. The use of information and communication technology for safeguard monitoring work is \nalso being piloted.10 Other operations departments are planning to have systems similar to that \nof the South Asia Department or a bespoke system to meet their requirements. Opportunities also \nexist to benefit from lessons and tools developed by other IFIs to facilitate effective due diligence \nand monitoring of safeguards implementation, such as the World Bank\u2019s environmental and social \nincident response tool. These good and innovative practices and lessons need to be identified \n                                                \ninterlinkages  with  environmental  and  social  safeguards.  Safeguard  tools,  such  as  strategic  environmental \nassessments, should be used early in the policy-making process when there is greater potential for adverse impacts \nto be avoided. Use of integrated assessment and management approaches can complement consideration of \nindividual safeguard requirements at the project level by making more efficient and effective use of limited project \nresources to address safeguards and crosscutting thematic issues, which would ultimately improve project design, \nimplementation, and development outcomes \n7  Other parties include environment, housing, and resettlement agencies. \n8  During 2016\u20132018, there were annual increases in the number of complaints from project-affected people to ADB\u2019s \nAccountability Mechanism. Resettlement, compensation, and land acquisition were the major issues raised, followed \nby community and social issues, consultation and participation, and environment.  \n9  World Bank. 2017. World Bank Environmental and Social Framework. Washington, DC. \n10 For example, the Safeguards Division of SDCC piloted the use of handheld tablets and software for resettlement \nassessment, and ADB\u2019s Sri Lanka Resident Mission developed and is using a geographic information system for \nsupervising and monitoring environmental safeguards implementation. There are also opportunities to use remote \nsensing and drones for baseline surveys and implementation monitoring. \n ", "3 \nand transferred within and between DMCs. Operations departments have ongoing safeguard TA \nprojects to support such work at departmental level, but better coordination to foster knowledge \nsharing and exchange between them is required. Executing and implementing agencies need \naccess  to  technical  expertise,  guidance,  tools,  case  studies,  and  trainings  to  support  the \napplication of good and innovative practices, including integrated assessment, at the project level. \n \n7.  Urban  development  projects  (including  operations  in  the  water  and  other  urban \ninfrastructure and services, energy, and transport sectors) are often located in settings that face \nmultidimensional challenges such as rapid increases in population, densely populated residential \nareas, aging societies, infrastructure deficits, increasing risks from climate change and disasters, \nenvironmental  stresses,  and  fast-paced  technological  advancement.  The  TA  will  support \nintegrated assessment approaches on linear projects in urban areas, to help executing and \nimplementing  agencies  better  address  crosscutting  thematic  issues  in  urban  development \nprojects, including climate change. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: ADB environmental and social safeguards \nupheld (footnote 1). The TA will have the following outcome: capacity to implement safeguards in \nADB projects strengthened.11 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n9.  Output  1:  Safeguard management  systems,  technical resources, and  trainings \nimproved.  This  output  will  develop  safeguard  resources  (including  guidelines,  tools,  good \npractice notes, and training materials) to strengthen due diligence, supervision, and monitoring of \nsafeguards implementation.12 These resources will address identified gaps and seek to enhance \ngood practices related to (i) safeguard management systems, (ii) technical assessments, (iii) \ndifferent  lending  modalities  and  implementation  arrangements  for  both  sovereign  and \nnonsovereign operations, and (iv) crosscutting thematic issues.13 At least 12 safeguard resources \nwill be developed, including 6 addressing crosscutting thematic issues. Topics for safeguard \nresources include risk-based monitoring and management systems; effective project grievance \nredress mechanisms; cumulative and induced impact assessment; transboundary assessment \ntools; biodiversity assessment; physical cultural resources assessment; and land acquisition and \nresettlement, including voluntary land donation and indigenous peoples safeguards. Crosscutting \nthematic topics related to integrated environmental and social assessment will take into account \ngender, including meaningful consultation and sexual abuse, exploitation, and harassment risks; \ncommunity health impacts and risks; climate change mitigation and adaptation; disaster risks; \n                                                \n11 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n12 Safeguard resources developed, including lessons and good and innovative practice case studies from within and \noutside ADB, will build on resources of SDCC, operations departments, resident missions, and other IFIs. Safeguard \nresources for output 1 will be disseminated to executing and implementing agencies, and their consultants and \ncontractors through ADB knowledge portals and trainings. Crosscutting thematic safeguard resources will be \ndeveloped and disseminated with the support of thematic groups. \n13 Lending modalities include general corporate finance, financial intermediaries including those onlending to other \nfinancial intermediaries, policy-based loans, and results-based loans. Design\u2013build\u2013operate and public\u2013private \npartnership approaches will also be considered. \n \n ", "4 \nfragile and conflict-affected situations; livelihood development; occupational health and safety \nrisks; and core labor standards.14 \n \n10.  The TA will carry out diagnostic studies (considering ADB\u2019s existing portfolio) to identify \nexisting challenges, capacity gaps, and good practices. The TA will take into consideration \nlessons and the outputs of previous TA projects on safeguards; DMC contexts; current corporate \npractices at other IFIs; relevance to sovereign and nonsovereign operations; draft IED evaluation \nfindings, if available; stakeholder consultations and policy dialogue, including with civil society \norganizations  (CSOs);  and  examples  of  international  good  practices,  including  the  use  of \ntechnology.15 For crosscutting thematic issues, diagnostic studies will pay particular attention to \nentry points in the project cycle to undertake assessments, including during the planning stages \nof country partnership strategies and country operations business plans. \n \n11.  To  help  ADB  projects  better  address  crosscutting  thematic  issues,  an  integrated \nassessment tool kit will be developed for use by executing and implementing agencies. It will \naddress (i) screening and scoping, and affected person and stakeholder mapping (including CSO \nidentification)  for  all  types  of  projects;  and  (ii)  the  assessment  and  management  of  the \nconstruction of linear projects (e.g. roads, pipelines, transmission and distribution lines) in urban \nareas in a format that can be tailored by the operations departments to address the specific needs \nof DMCs or executing and implementing agency situations.16 The tool kit will consider existing \nformats and templates and will make use of smart technologies (e.g., app-based technologies \nand, for spatial elements, the use of geographical information systems and other innovative \npractices) to capture the results of assessments and store information digitally for future use in \n \nproject design and implementation.\n \n12.  To strengthen DMC knowledge and capacity at the project level, an online foundational \nsafeguard training course with references to relevant safeguard resources and good practice \nexamples will be developed, tested, and rolled out.17 It will be designed to be regionally applicable, \nbut in a format that can be (i) modified by the operations departments to address the specific \nneeds of DMCs or executing  and implementing agencies, and (ii) used (if desired) for the \npurposes of basic safeguard certification for those working on projects. \n \n13.  To help ADB projects improve risk management and monitoring of their safeguards \nperformance, and to better allocate safeguard resources to address identified risks, the TA will \nintroduce  a  system  (to  be  cascaded  down  to  safeguards  monitoring  by  executing  and \nimplementing  agencies)  that  records  and  monitors  risks  during  project  planning  and \n                                                \n14 ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6) will fund support for (i) safeguard management systems, (ii) \ntechnical assessments, and (iii) different lending modalities and implementation arrangements for both sovereign \nand nonsovereign operations. The Urban Climate Change Resilience Trust Fund will fund crosscutting thematic \ntopics. \n15 Research findings will be shared internally and with other IFIs during joint safeguards community of practice meetings \nand through other safeguards networks. For crosscutting thematic issues, thematic groups will be consulted in \ndeveloping terms of reference to avoid conflict and maximize synergies with their ongoing and proposed studies. \nAreas for collaboration include diagnostic studies, tool development, and the selection of common projects under \noutput 2. \n16 The focus is on linear projects since these often involve a range of environmental issues (e.g., habitat loss and \nfragmentation, pollution risks, occupational and community health and safety risks, and loss of and/or damage to \nphysical and cultural resources) and have high involuntary resettlement risk. Urban, transport, and energy projects, \nmany of which are linear in nature, are most often the subject of complaints filed with the Accountability Mechanism. \nHowever, the toll kit will be designed for adaptation to a range of nonlinear projects. To identify the environmental \nand social impacts and opportunities early in the policy-making process (when there is greater potential for adverse \nimpacts to be avoided), strategic integrated assessment of plans and programs will be considered. \n17 The online course will be made available through ADB eLearn and on Development Asia. \n ", "5 \nimplementation. The TA will establish, test, and roll out an integrated safeguard performance \ntracking system (ISPTS), which will be an interactive project-level and portfolio-wide project risk \nmanagement and monitoring system. The ISPTS will have repository and decision-support \nfunctions  to  enable  easy  report  generation  at  the  project  and  portfolio  levels.  To  ensure \nconsistency with existing systems and minimize duplication of effort, an analytical study will be \nconducted to evaluate existing and planned safeguard monitoring tools within ADB, as well as \nsimilar tools used by other multilateral development banks and private sector institutions. This \nanalytical study will help to define the data to be captured. \n \n14.  Output 2: Safeguard support to developing member countries provided. This output \nwill focus on testing and disseminating the safeguard resources and integrated assessment tool \nkit developed under output 1. This will be achieved through their application to selected projects \nand early support prior to project concept development, including at plan or program level. In \ncoordination with the operations departments, consultant support will be provided to support the \nuse of safeguard resources and the integrated assessment tool kit, including the provision of \ntrainings, field visits, technical studies, and project outputs reviews. The selection of projects will \nbe done in consultation with the operations departments and thematic groups, and will be \ndistributed across regions and sectors.18 Project support will enable good and innovative practice \ncase study examples, including the use of integrated assessment, as well as technologies, to be \nobtained and the draft safeguard resources and working version of the integrated assessment \ntool kit to be refined prior to finalization. Projects selected for testing will share their experiences \nduring regional trainings to promote the use of the final safeguard resources and integrated \nassessment tool kit, and to support peer-to-peer learning between executing and implementing \nagencies. \n \n15.  Four regional trainings on crosscutting thematic issues and integrated assessment will be \ndeveloped and delivered to DMC participants and targeted to executing and implementing \nagencies that have long-term relationships with ADB, and that could potentially use the final \nsafeguard resources and integrated assessment tool kit during future ADB projects.19 At the DMC \nlevel, ADB will work with safeguard learning centers (or their equivalent) on the delivery of \ntrainings; training materials will be packaged and kept in a readily accessible location. Training \nmaterials will be regionally applicable but developed in a format that can be tailored by the \noperations departments to address the specific needs of DMCs or executing and implementing \nagencies. To scale up the availability of training opportunities, options for online learning and \naccreditation of training providers, including regional safeguard learning centers, will be explored. \n \n16.  To  improve  the  capacity  of  DMCs  to  deal  with  \u201csensitive\u201d  issues  or  \u201cproblematic\u201d \nimplementation situations, the TA will provide technical expertise to support selected DMCs in \nconducting research studies and capacity development activities.20 Knowledge and lessons from \nthese research studies will be used to help build a library of good practice case studies to be \n                                                \n18 Selection Criteria (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n19 Trainings will be open for the participation of executing and implementing agencies and their contractors and \nconsultants, including CSOs acting as consultants and other parties involved in safeguards implementation and \nregulation in DMCs, including environment, housing, and resettlement agencies. \n20 \u201cSensitive\u201d refers to the presence of natural or critical habitats, protected areas, nationally or internationally important \nphysical cultural resources, or particularly disadvantaged or vulnerable individuals or groups at risk. \u201cProblematic\u201d \nrefers to high environmental or social risk implementation situations in DMCs with weak country safeguard systems.  \nTechnical expertise to be funded by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6) will include suitably qualified \nand internationally experienced experts in biodiversity conservation, pollution, physical cultural resources, labor, \nhealth and safety risks, involuntary resettlement, livelihood restoration, and indigenous peoples.

Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $3,000,000, of which (i) $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6) and (ii) $2,000,000 will be financed \non a grant basis by the Urban Climate Change Resilience Trust Fund under the Urban Financing \nPartnership Facility and administered by ADB.21 Key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  ADB will administer the TA through SDCC with the support of counterparts of SDCC from \nthe operations departments and in collaboration with the social development, gender, climate \nchange  and  disaster  risk  management,  and  environment  thematic  groups.  To  facilitate \nimplementation, the TA will establish a working group including focal points from the Safeguards \nDivision of SDCC; thematic groups; the operations departments (including resident missions); the \nOffice of the General Counsel; the Office of Information Systems and Technology; the Office of \nthe  Special  Project  Facilitator;  and  the  Procurement,  Portfolio,  and  Financial  Management \nDepartment.  In  addition,  for  each  consultant  package,  a  coordination  team  (comprising \nrepresentatives from the Safeguards Division of SDCC and safeguard focal persons from the \noperations departments) shall be formed to oversee its design and implementation and review \ndeliverables, calling on the thematic group focal points as is needed. For the DMCs involved in \noutput 2, appropriate implementation arrangements will be established at the DMC level with the \nsupport of resident missions. The platform, system, or software used to host the safeguard \nresources and online training course and for the integrated assessment tool kit and IPSTS will be \nselected to ensure long-term sustainability. Risk assessment will be undertaken in consultation \nwith the Office of Information Systems and Technology before determining if a cloud-based \ntechnology solution should be used.
