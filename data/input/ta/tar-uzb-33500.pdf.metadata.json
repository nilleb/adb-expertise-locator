INTRODUCTION\n1.  The Government of the Republic of Uzbekistan has recognized the urgency of developing a\nsound and well-regulated banking sector that emphasizes efficiency and market orientation, which\ncan  better  withstand  crises  and  challenges.  The  Government  plans  to  accomplish  this  by\n(i) developing a holistic banking reform strategy to strengthen banking regulation and supervision,\nencourage commercial banks to make objective commercial and financial decisions, and design\napproaches to improve portfolio quality and intermediation process; and (ii) converting selected\nsector-specific banks to universal commercial banks in line with international best practices, as a\nprelude  to  their  ultimate  privatization.  In  June  1999,  the  Government  requested  for  technical\nassistance (TA) for (i) developing a banking sector reform strategy and its implementation plan, and\n(ii) supporting the conversion of Paktha Bank and Mevasabsavot Bank to universal commercial\nbanks.1 A Fact-finding Mission visited Uzbekistan between 2 and 9 September 1999 to firm up\nunderstanding on the objectives, scope, cost, financing, and implementation arrangements for the\nTA. The TA's logical framework is in Appendix 1.\nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. Uzbekistan inherited from the former Soviet Union (FSU) an economic system based on\ncentralized planning of production and control of resources. In Soviet times, the State Planning\nAuthority financed activities in line with the State\u2019s production targets, and commercial banks lent for\nthis purpose. The banks had no independent lending decision-making powers; their capacity for risk\nmanagement, credit appraisal, or project selection was extremely weak; and they lacked effective\ntechniques for assessing income generation and solvency of borrowers. Weaknesses in the Central\nBank's monetary policy management and banking supervision distorted credit allocation and pricing\nmechanisms. Banks' financial statements\u2019 disclosures were limited. Banks were assigned the dual\nrole of tax assessors and collectors on depositors\u2019 incomes. In the late 1980s, several new banks\nwere established by state-owned industrial and agricultural enterprises of the FSU. This trend\ncontinued after Uzbekistan\u2019s independence in 1991. Most state-owned commercial banks were\nsector specific in their operations. They sought public deposits but concentrated lending to their\nowners. Banks carried significant credit risks amidst a weak institutional environment for debt\nrecovery. These factors over time resulted in the accumulation of a large amount of nonperforming\nloans.\n3. Since 1995 and more so after the Asian and Russian financial crises, the Government has\nrecognized  the  need  to  launch  broad-ranging  banking  reforms.  Accordingly,  the  Government\n(i) introduced an electronic automated payments, clearing and settlement system between the\nCentral  Bank  and  commercial  banks  in  1995;  (ii) introduced  a  two-tier  banking  system2  and\nseparated functions between the Central Bank and commercial banks; (iii) strengthened the Central\nBank\u2019s regulatory and supervisory role in 1996 by requiring commercial banks\u2019 adherence  to\nprudential norms, classification of their loan portfolio on the basis of collectibility, and adequate\nprovisioning  for  nonperforming  loans;  and  (iv) introduced  in  1997  new  bank  accounting  and\ndisclosure standards consistent with international standards.3 In addition, a presidential decree was\npassed in October 1998 to improve the management of joint-stock banks. This was followed by the\nadoption of a few resolutions of the Cabinet of Ministers in January 1999 that aim to improve\ncompetition among banks and provide for the conversion of sector-specific banks to universal\ncommercial banks.\n                                               \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in September 1999.\n2  By the enactment of the Central Bank Law in 1995, and the Law on Banks and Banking Activity in 1996.\n3  Banks  have  moved  to  a  double-entry  accrual  accounting  system.  However,  they  have  not  fully  adopted\nInternational Accounting Standards (IAS).", "2\n4. The Government is keen to gradually expand financial sector reforms. For this purpose, it\nhas approached a number of aid agencies including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World\nBank, and European Union Technical Assistance for the Commonwealth of Independent States\n(EU-TACIS) to provide support in different areas. The IMF, as part of its consultation, has been\nassisting in (i) the Central Bank of  Uzbekistan\u2019s  (CBU's)  internal  reorganization,  (ii) improving\nbanking  legislation,  (iii)  preparing  banking  sector  regulatory  and  supervision  codes,  and  (iv)\nconducting diagnostic audits of commercial banks. The World Bank approved a large TA loan in\nMay 19994 to (i) strengthen CBU's management information and payments system; (ii) support the\n1999 and 2000 audits of the country's commercial banks by international audit firms to determine\namong other things, their compliance with the IAS; and (iii) develop a strategy for restructuring the\nloan portfolios and institutional strengthening of five banks.5 The EU-TACIS provided TA in 1996,6 to\n(i) develop the charter of the Uzbekistan Banking Association (UBA), (ii) upgrade the library and\ncomputer facilities of the Banking and Finance Academy, and (iii) provide advisory services to\ncommercial banks, including broad exposure to international best practices.\n5. ADB has now been approached to expand its support in the banking sector to assist (i) the\ndevelopment  and  implementation  of  a  banking  sector  reform  strategy,  and  (ii) institutional\nstrengthening of two banks to facilitate their conversion to universal commercial banks. This builds\nfurther on ADB's past TA program which included two country-specific TAs and two regional TAs.\nThe former helped (i) the National Bank of Uzbekistan, which hitherto had concentrated on trade\nfinancing, diversify in project financing and build appraisal capacity;7 and (ii) the Regional Banking\nTraining Center and the Banking and Finance Academy train the trainers in the international\nbanking practices and offer special out-of-country training to middle- to senior-level bankers.8 The\nfirst regional TA provided banking regulators and supervisors with basic training in the principles of\nbanking supervision in a market economy.9 The second regional TA helped modernize commercial\nbank credit management and operational systems in transitional economies.10\n6. The TAs of the World Bank and EU-TACIS have not specifically focussed on (i) issues of\nCBU\u2019s monetary policy, interest rate administration, directed lending and treasury bills operations;\n(ii) restructuring of other state-owned banks than those listed in footnote 5; (iii) credit appraisal and\nrisk  management;  (iv)  corporate  governance  of  banks;  (v)  fiscal  consequences  of  bank\nrestructuring; and (vi) implementation of best practices in banking regulation and supervision. ADB\u2019s\nnew TA will complement the work sponsored by the IMF, World Bank, and EU-TACIS by addressing\nthe above areas. It will support and facilitate the (i) development of a banking sector reform strategy\ndrawing on results of past TAs including the audit of commercial banks, and recommending an\naction plan for the introduction of sound regulatory and governance practices at both central bank\nand commercial bank level; and (ii)  introduction of best international practices in credit appraisal,\nrisk management, internal control, and financial disclosure policies to two selected state-owned\nbanks.\n                                               \n4  UZ: PE 9131: Financial Institution Building Project, for $25 million, approved on 27 May 1999.\n5 Asaka Bank, UzpromstroiBank, Ipak Yoli Bank, Andizhan Bank, and Uzhilsber Bank.\n6  FINUZ 96-01: Support for Commercial Banking Sector, for ECU1.6 million, approved in November 1996.\n7  TA 2714-UZB: Institutional Strengthening of National Bank of Uzbekistan, for $830,000, approved on 17 December\n1996.\n8  TA 3045-UZB: Developing Commercial Banking Skills, for $1,000,000, approved on 10 July 1998.\n9 TA 5699-REG: Strengthening Banking Capabilities in Transition Economies in Asia, for $885,000, approved on 27\nAugust 1996.\n10 TA 5821-REG: Strengthening Commercial Banking Skills in Transition Economies Asia, for $970,000, approved on\n22 December 1998.", "3\n7. The TA is consistent with ADB\u2019s proposed new country operational strategy for Uzbekistan,\nwhich supports policy reforms and capacity building to facilitate the orderly transition from a centrally\nplanned to a market economy. The new strategy recognizes the importance of a financially sound\nand viable banking system, which can promote efficient financial intermediation, and calls for ADB\u2019s\nparticipation in financial sector reforms. Efficient financial intermediation is necessary to mobilize\npublic savings and use them to finance activities in which the country has a comparative advantage.\nADB\u2019s earlier two TAs to Uzbekistan\u2019s banking sector were essentially geared toward capacity\nbuilding and providing commercial bankers with training in best practices of commercial banking at\nthe basic level. This TA has a broader objective and scope, and aims to develop a policy reform\nagenda for the banking sector, while assisting in selective implementation of these reforms by\nsupporting institutional strengthening and commercialization of two banks.\n8. The  banking  reform  strategy  and  the  analytical  work  to  be  undertaken  to  support\nrestructuring of the two banks under this TA will feed into ADB's policy dialogue in the financial\nsector. The background work undertaken will help in formulating a comprehensive policy package\nfor banking sector reforms for a potential program lending operation and upgrading the technical\ncapabilities of two selected commercial banks to efficiently carry on lending.\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.  Objectives\n9. The overall goal of the TA is to (i) strengthen efficiency, market-orientation, and stability\nof the banking sector; (ii) improve intermediation; and (iii) facilitate the timely flow of credit\nwithout distortion in pricing or delivery to those sectors in which the country has a comparative\nadvantage. This is to be achieved by (i) development of a banking sector reform strategy and\nimplementation plan; and (ii) introduction in two commercial banks of international best practices\nto facilitate  their  conversion  to universal  commercial  banks  as  a  prelude  to  their  ultimate\nprivatization. By promoting improved financial intermediation and corporate governance at the\nmicrolevel for two banks, the latter component will demonstrate a broad-based enhancement of\nthe quality of financial intermediation throughout the banking sector. The output of the TA will\nset the stage for further banking sector reforms in Uzbekistan.\nB.  Scope\n1. Part A: Banking Sector Reform and Restructuring\n10. The  TA  will  support  a  comprehensive  evaluation  of  the  banking  sector  and  lay  the\nfoundation for a sound, efficient, well-regulated, modern banking sector that can better withstand\nchallenges and crises. The TA will provide (i) a diagnosis of the banking sector, identifying the\nstrengths and weaknesses of its various segments; (ii) an action plan laying down the pace and\nsequence of reforms over the short, medium, and longer terms; and (iii) policies and administrative\nmeasures required to facilitate the implementation of the action plan. This component will cover\nlinkages and synergies between monetary and banking sector policies and capital markets. It will\nalso recommend measures to (i) improve CBU's regulatory and supervisory role in allocating and\npricing credit; (ii) improve interbank competition; (iii) abolish the role of banks as tax assessors; and\n(iv) improve the financial disclosure, corporate governance, and regulatory submissions  in  the\nsector.", "4\n2. Part B: Facilitating Conversion of Paktha Bank and Mevasabsavot Bank to\nUniversal Commercial Banks\n11. This component will introduce in Pakhta Bank and Mevasabsavot Bank best practices in\ncredit  appraisal,  risk  management,  and  corporate  governance.  In  improving  credit  appraisal\ncapabilities, the TA will concentrate on (i) loan quality (from the perspectives of repayment and\ncollateral enforcement); (ii) internal controls in credit processing; and (iii) credit diversification and\nsingle borrowers exposure limits. In improving risk management, the TA will address the issues of\ncredit  risk,  exchange  risk,  interest  rate  risk,  and  counterparty  risk.  In  improving  corporate\ngovernance, the TA will enhance transparency in financial disclosure by banks and their internal\nsupervision by their boards. Internal reforms and restructuring of these two banks are necessary to\nfacilitate their transformation to universal commercial banks as a prelude to their privatization.\n12. The  consultants  for  component  B  will  closely  coordinate  and  draw  on  the  work\nundertaken under the World Bank\u2019s TA loan. To ensure that the banking sector reform strategy\nformulated under component A is consistent with and relevant to the prevailing practical situation in\nUzbekistan\u2019s banking sector, the team leader of Part A will closely interact with team leader of Part\nB and integrate the findings of Part B. UBA will be responsible for the overall coordination.\nC.  Implementation Arrangements\n13. UBA will be the Executing Agency for the TA. UBA is a statutory legal entity established\nunder a Government decree and represents the interests of all the country\u2019s commercial banks.11\nUBA's charter requires it to (i) assist commercial banks in deepening economic reforms, (ii) establish\na modern banking infrastructure of international standards, and (iii) assist commercial banks in\nindependent  decision  making  in  accordance  with  best  international  practice.  UBA's  senior\nmanagement comprises individuals with practical commercial banking and legal experience. UBA is\nfacilitating the conversion of all its member banks into universal commercial ones and will use this\nTA as a pilot demonstration project for assisting other sector-specific banks among its members in\ndoing so. UBA has the necessary infrastructure and funding to be the EA for this TA. It will establish\na special TA coordinating committee, comprising representatives from UBA, Ministry of Finance,\nCBU, Pakhta Bank, and Mevasabsavot Bank, to monitor the implementation of the TA. UBA will\nprovide necessary logistical support for TA implementation. The Government will ensure that the\nconsultants are provided the necessary information for undertaking their terms of reference for both\ncomponents of the TA.\n14. The TA will be implemented over a period of nine months and will involve a total of\n44 person-months consulting services: 20 international and 24 domestic. The consultants\u2019 areas  of\nexpertise are indicated in Appendix 2. The 14 person-months (8 international and 6 domestic) for\nPart A will be implemented by three individual consultants (two international and one domestic)\nselected in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements\nsatisfactory to ADB for the selection of domestic consultants. The implementation of this component\nwill commence in January 2000 and end in September 2000. Part B involving 30 person-months (12\ninternational and 18 domestic) will commence in March 2000 and end in September 2000. A firm of\ninternational consultants will be selected to provide a five-person team for this purpose.  The\ninternational firm will be selected using the simplified technical proposal in accordance with ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the selection\nof domestic consultants. The reporting arrangements under the TA are described in Appendix 2. All\n                                               \n11 UBA was incorporated on 28 July 1995 with 24 member banks. In September 1999, it had 33 member banks and\nwas chaired by the Minister of Finance.", "5\nprocurement financed under the TA will be carried out by the international consultants in accordance\nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.\nD.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n15. The cost of the TA is estimated at $1,117,000 equivalent, comprising a foreign exchange\ncost of $910,000 and a local currency cost of $207,000 equivalent (Appendix 3). The Government\nhas requested an ADB grant of $1,000,000 equivalent, to cover the entire foreign exchange cost\nand $90,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed by the ADB on a grant\nbasis from the ADB-funded TA program. UBA will finance the remaining $117,000 equivalent in\nlocal currency costs in kind through the provision of office space, local counterpart staff, seminar,\ntraining facilities, and local transportation. UBA will recover its costs from the two banks in separate\nand mutually satisfactory arrangements with them.\nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n16. The  President,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  by  the  Board,  has  approved  the\nprovision of the technical assistance, on a grant basis, to the Government of the Republic of\nUzbekistan  in  an  amount  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $1,000,000,  for  the  purposes  of\nStrengthening of the Banking Sector, and hereby reports such action to the Board", "Appendix 1, page 1\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK\nDesign Summary Targets Monitoring Risks and Assumptions\nMechanisms\nI.

Introduction\n1. The technical assistance (TA) will be implemented over a nine-month period and will\ninvolve 44 person-months of consulting services (20 international and 24 domestic).\n2. Part  A  (14  person-months)  will  be  implemented  by  a  three-member  team  of  two\ninternational consultants and one domestic consultant to be selected in accordance with the\nAsian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The implementation\nof this component will commence in January 2000 and end in September 2000. The team\nleader  (international  consultant)  for  this  component  will  be  an  expert  in  banking  sector\nrestructuring strategies. He/she will have had  substantial experience  in  bank  restructuring,\nparticularly in the transformation from an activist regulatory regime to a prudential supervisory\nsystem. The team leader will provide 6 person-months\u2019 service and will be responsible for the\noutput  of  the team.  The team  leader  will  be  assisted  by  (i)  an  international  banking  and\ngovernance  specialist  (2 person-months),  and  (ii)  a  domestic  reforms,  restructuring,  and\ngovernance specialist (6 person-months).\n3. Part B (30 person-months input) will be implemented by a five-person team. The team\nleader will be an international banking credit and risk management specialist with substantial\nexperience in these disciplines with one or more major and reputable international banks. The\nteam leader will provide 6 person-months consultancy and will be responsible for the output of\nthe entire team. The team leader will be assisted by (i) an international bank accounting, internal\ncontrols  and  corporate  governance  specialist  (6  person-months),  and  (ii)  three  domestic\nconsultants (each for 6 person-months). One of the domestic consultants will be a bank credit\nappraisal expert. The second will be a bank risk management expert. The third will be a bank\naccounting,  internal  control,  and  corporate  governance  expert.  The  implementation  of  this\ncomponent will  begin  in  March  2000 and  end  in September 2000. A firm  of  international\nconsultants will be selected for this component in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use\nof Consultants. The consultants under component B will closely coordinate and draw on the\nwork undertaken under the World Bank\u2019s TA loan. To ensure that the banking sector reform\nstrategy formulated under component A is consistent with and relevant to the prevailing practical\nsituation in Uzbekistan\u2019s banking sector, the team leader of component A will closely interact with\nteam leader of component B and integrate the findings of component B.\nB. Reporting Requirements\n4. Within one month of commencement of the TA, the consultants will submit an inception\nreport to ADB, Ministry of Finance (MOF), Central Bank of Uzbekistan (CBU), Uzbekistan\nBanking Association (UBA), Pakhta Bank, and Mevasabsavot Bank. This report will cover the\nplanned TA implementation schedule, anticipated issues and problems, and ways of resolving\nthem. At the end of the first phase (about 100 days after the commencement of the TA), the\nconsultants  will  submit  an  interim  report. When  the  special  Banking  Restructuring  Unit  is\nestablished in MOF, the consultants under component A will also report to that unit in addition to\nthe coordination committee.1 Thirty days before the conclusion of their work, the consultants will\nprepare a draft final report that will integrate the findings and recommendations from each\nexpert. The draft will be discussed at a tripartite meeting involving representatives from ADB,\n                                               \n1  A special Banking Restructuring Unit is to be established in the Ministry of Finance in early 2000 to address the\nproblems of State-owned banks in Uzbekistan.\n(Reference in text: page 4, para. 14)", "                                 Appendix 2, page 2\nMOF, CBU, UBA, Pakhta Bank, and Mevasabsavot Bank. The final report, incorporating the\nrecommendations, will be submitted within two weeks after the tripartite meeting (an English\nversion to ADB and a Russian version to the other parties).\nC. Expertise Required and Job Description\n1. Part A\na. Team Leader/Banking Sector Reforms and Restructuring Specialist\n(6 person-months)\n5. The team leader will have had at least five years experience in banking sector reforms\nand restructuring of banks, preferably during the change from a activist regulatory regime to one\nof prudential supervision. The consultant should have at least a master\u2019s degree in economics,\npreferably with 10 years experience in banking supervision and regulation in a  developed\nmarket economy. Prior experience in former centrally planned economies in transition is highly\ndesirable.\n6. An  in-depth  analysis  of  the  present  status  should  be  the  starting  point  for  this\ncomponent. The analysis should take into account the current problems in the country\u2019s banking\nsector. The analyses and recommendations should discuss the sequencing and phasing of\nreforms  and  transition  issues.  Further,  in  preparing  a  banking  sector  reform  strategy,  a\nnecessary starting point is to undertake projections of supply/demand, business opportunities,\nand  strategic  steps  to  capitalize  on  those  opportunities  (including  a  discussion  of  the\nsequencing of the recommended steps).\n7.
