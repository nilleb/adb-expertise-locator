In  Strategy  2020,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  identifies  environmentally \nsustainable growth, including infrastructure and climate change, as a top development and \noperating priority.1 Consistent with the strategy, ADB\u2019s Sustainable Transport Initiative (STI) is \nrefocusing transport operations on sustainability. In line with these initiatives, the ADB Board of \nDirectors approved the loan program for clean bus leasing (CBL) to provide an alternative \nfinancing mechanism to accelerate the adoption of clean bus technology for public transport \noperations in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). 2 In this context, a \u201cclean bus\u201d is a bus that \nmeets stringent emissions and energy-efficiency criteria, including buses running on cleaner fuel \nsuch as compressed or liquefied natural gas, and biomethane; other energy-efficient and new-\nenergy buses such as hybrid, battery-only electric, and fuel-cell electric buses; and buses that \nmeet the most advanced emission standards of Euro IV equivalent emissions or above.3 ADB is \nproviding term loans to private sector financial leasing companies (up to a limit of $100 million \nper company and a total program limit of $275 million) for the specific purpose of leasing clean \nbuses  to  public  transport  operators  under  financial  leasing  arrangements.  The  program  is \nexpected to finance the leasing of about 5,000 buses in at least 15 cities in the  PRC by 2018, \nwith at least 30% of the public transport operators located in less-developed inland or western \nprovinces. \n \n2.  During  the  preparation  of  the  CBL  program,  extensive  consultation  involved  \ngovernments,  bus  leasing  companies,  and  public  transport  operators  in  the  PRC.  This \nconsultation revealed strong potential demand for the leasing of clean buses, and the need for \ntechnical assistance (TA) to ensure that the potential environmental, social, and economic \nbenefits are fully achieved by public transport operators, especially those in smaller cities in \nless-developed inland or western provinces. The design and monitoring framework for the TA is \nin Appendix 1.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Recent rapid growth in urban population and incomes in the PRC have led to high car \nownership, congestion, and air pollution. Since 2006, the national and local governments have \nmade the promotion of public transport a strategic priority and increased efforts to provide \nflexible, low-cost, efficient bus transport. Many cities have set ambitious targets for replacing \nand adding to existing bus fleets, and some have provided subsidies to bus operators to partly \noffset the high upfront capital costs of new vehicles. Local governments are promoting the \nadoption  of  clean  bus  technology  as  a  more  sustainable  alternative  for  public  transport \noperations. Recent severe air pollution events in northern PRC are adding greater urgency to \nthe replacement of older diesel bus fleets and adoption of clean bus technology. \n \n4.  The CBL program will accelerate the deployment and diffusion of low emission and new \nenergy buses, and help counteract the shift to private cars in urban areas by making public \ntransport a more attractive alternative. However, buses will not necessarily be used in the most \nefficient way or the potential emission reductions and modal shifts fully realized and sustained. \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n2  ADB. 2012. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan Program to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China for Clean Bus Leasing. Manila. \n3  The vehicle emission standards in the PRC are similar to the European emission standards, which define the \nacceptable limits for exhaust emissions of new vehicles sold in EU member states. \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 16 April 2014. \n ", "2   \nInternational  studies  indicate  that  poor  driving  and  inadequate  maintenance  of  buses  can \nincrease fuel consumption by an average of 10%\u201315%, and that poor selection of vehicle type \nand poor management of bus operations erodes potential savings. This means that if clean \nbuses are not selected, managed, driven, and well maintained, then a significant amount of the \npotential benefits will likely be lost. \n \n5.  The TA will reinforce and enhance the impact of the CBL program by adding a focus on \nefficient selection, operation, and management of clean buses operating in urban areas. The TA \nis noted in the report and recommendation of the President for the CBL program (footnote 2), \ncontingent  on  availability  of  financing  from  the  Global  Environment  Facility  (GEF).  GEF \nfinancing was confirmed on 15 January 2014 as part of the Asian Sustainable Transport and \nUrban Development (ASTUD) program. The ASTUD program, which is administered by ADB \nand financed by the GEF, provides TA and investment support.  \n \n6.  The TA will support the development of sustainable transport in the PRC (para. 1). It is \nfully in line with the priorities of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132015 for the PRC,5 in \nparticular, with the strategy\u2019s emphasis on mainstreaming climate change considerations and \nsupport for green finance. It supports finance sector development, one of the private sector \noperating focuses identified in the strategy. The TA also supports implementation of the PRC's \nTwelfth  Five-Year  Plan,  2011-2015,  which  accentuates  resource  conservation  and \nenvironmental  protection,  and  prioritizes  improving  energy  efficiency,  reducing  pollution \nemissions, and developing cleaner and renewable energy.6 \n \n7.  The TA fully supports ADB\u2019s STI, which focuses on creating accessible, safe, affordable, \nand environment-friendly transport systems. According to the STI, ADB should focus on roles \nwhere  it  can  significantly  add  value  to  sustainable  transport  activities.  To  optimize  its \ncontribution, ADB should design its operations to build on ADB-wide and international best \npractices in sustainable transport and channel financing to projects and activities where ADB \ninvolvement  will  result  in  increased  sustainability.  ADB  assistance  should  help  developing \nmember countries overcome sector obstacles to wider adoption of sustainable transport. Based \non these principles, urban transport is identified as an area in which ADB should scale up \nsupport for sustainability.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact of the TA will be that the environmental, social, and economic benefits of \nadopting clean bus technology in the PRC are maximized. The outcome of the TA will be \nimproved selection, management, and operation of clean buses in the urban, suburban, and \nintercity public transport markets. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA components provide an integrated approach to supporting improved clean bus \nselection, operation, management, and continual improvement.  \n \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2012.

Output  1:  Guidebook  for  selecting  a  clean  and  accessible  bus  developed.  A \nguidebook will be developed for selecting the right type of clean bus in terms of energy source \n(e.g., compressed natural gas, hybrid, electric), bus size (e.g., articulated, standard, smaller), \nand inclusive access design characteristics (e.g., low floor, wheelchair accessible, high-visibility \nhandrails) for the required operating conditions (e.g., bus rapid transit (BRT), feeder and general \nservices,  different  urban  forms,  congestion,  terrain,  climate).  In  this  context,  \u201cright\u201d  means \nachieving the joint goals of minimizing the energy intensity of bus operations, while maximizing \ninclusive access to public transport and the number of passengers using public transport. The \nguidebook will be based on detailed analysis of recent national and international research on \nthe in-service performance of different types of clean bus technology, and on existing guidance \nmaterials, notably the Bus Rapid Transit Planning Guide.7  \n \n11.  Output 2: Knowledge materials for energy-efficient, inclusive, and competitive bus \noperations developed. The component directly complements and extends output 1. It moves \nthe focus from selecting the right clean bus to operating that bus (and fleet of buses) in the most \neffective way to achieve the dual goals of maximizing the energy efficiency of bus operations, \nwhile  maximizing  the  number  of  passengers  using  public  transport.  A  series  of  practical \nguidebooks, manuals, checklists, and training materials will be developed for implementing \nactions aimed at: (i) reducing energy consumption emissions through improved bus driving, \nmaintenance,  and  fleet  management;  (ii)  ensuring  that  public  transport  is  a  competitive \nalternative to private vehicles by better matching bus services and access to the needs of the \ntravel market; and (iii) promoting safe, secure, and inclusive access to public transport through \ninclusive access design features and training for drivers and conductors on the special needs of \nwomen and vulnerable groups, such as the disabled and elderly. These management tools will \ndraw  on  international  experience,  available  research  findings,  and  the  outcomes  of  GEF \nresearch and projects; and will be specifically tailored to bus operating conditions experienced \nin the PRC (allowing for regional differences) and to the needs of public transport operators in \nthe PRC. \n \n12.  Output  3:  Systems  for  energy-efficient  bus  operations  supported. The TA  will \nsupport initiatives to embed the management tools developed in output 2 into bus company \ninformation technology systems (ITSs). Effective use of these management tools requires up-to-\ndate and readily accessible data on operations about the day-to-day performance of the bus \nsystem  in  terms  of  technical  performance  (e.g.,  fuel  consumption,  bus  utilization)  and \ncompetitiveness  (e.g.,  bus  passengers,  service  coverage),  as  well  as  tools  for  data \nmanagement and analysis. Consultation undertaken for the CBL program found that many \npublic transport operators in the PRC are developing some form of computerized ITS to manage \nfinances and operations, or have plans to do so in the very near future. The component will \nassist  with  expanding  the  capability  of  these  bus  management  ITSs  to  include  data \nmanagement, analytical, and decision support tools that underpin implementation of energy-\nefficient, inclusive, and competitive bus operations. The systems will take data coming from on-\nboard, ticketing, depots, and other sources, and convert it into management information (i.e., \noperations and patronage performance indicators). This will enable bus operations managers to \nset and monitor appropriate energy-efficiency and patronage targets; set exception triggers; and \nrespond if particular buses, drivers, facilities, or routes are performing below expectations. In \nparticular, this component will (i) develop the functional specification for an ITS module that \nintegrates these tools into bus company ITSs; and (ii) design and implement a program of small \n                                                \n7  Wright, L. and Hook, W. 2007.

Output 4: Clean bus performance monitoring program implemented. A program for \nmonitoring, analyzing, and reporting on the actual fuel and energy performance of as many as \npossible of the buses leased under the CBL program will be developed. The results will be of \nbroad interest and substantial value for bus operators in the PRC and elsewhere in Asia and the \nPacific, and for researchers evaluating the actual performance of clean buses under different \noperating conditions. The results will be broadly disseminated through professional and industry \nmedia, and the information resources will be fed into the ADB\u2013STI knowledge sharing network \nand  provided  to  the  GEF  (output  5).  In  addition,  the  results  will  be  used  to  update  the \nguidebooks (outputs 1 and 2) and refine the information management tools (output 3).  \n \n14.  Output 5:  Awareness, training, and knowledge-sharing program developed. To \nmaximize  the  impact  of  the  CBL  program  and  of  the  information  resources  and  systems \ndeveloped by this TA, the component will be a focal point for coordinating and delivering \nactivities to develop awareness and visibility; offer initial training for some systems; and share \nthe knowledge within the PRC public transport subsector and bus industry. It will involve a \nprogram  of  workshops;  demonstrations  and  practical  training  sessions;  a  study  tour  to \nfamiliarize key stakeholders with best practice selection and operation of clean buses; and \nestablishment of a knowledge-sharing network that interfaces with the PRC public transport \noperators and more broadly though the ADB STI, the ASTUD, the GEF and other international \nnetworks. \n  \n15.  Output  6:  Project  management.  A  small  project  management  team  comprising  a \nproject coordinator and support staff will be established in the offices of the executing agency, \nthe PRC\u2019s Clean Development Mechanism Fund (CDMF). The component will support the \nincremental  costs  of  management  and  coordination  of  project  implementation,  knowledge \nsharing, monitoring and evaluation, and preparation of progress and financial reports. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,315,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nGlobal Environment Facility and administered by ADB. The cost estimates and financing plan \nare provided in Appendix 2. The government will provide counterpart support in the form of \ncounterpart staff, office accommodation, office supplies, secretarial assistance, and other in-\nkind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The CDMF will be the executing agency. It will establish a small project management \nteam  to  oversee  the  management  and  coordination  of  project  activities,  and  maintain \ninformation exchange with the government and the consultant teams. The CDMF has a key \nclimate change mitigation role in the PRC. It supports domestic climate change-related research \nand  TA  programs,  and  leverages  public  and  private  financing  to  scale-up  climate  change \nmitigation efforts.  ADB was involved in establishing the CDMF and has provided TA to build the \ncapacity of CDMF staff. \n \n18.  The TA is expected to be implemented from May 2014 to December 2016.  It will require \nnational consulting inputs of 81 person-months and international consulting inputs of 16 person-\nmonths. Outline terms of reference and details of the range of consultant skills required are \n ", "  5 \nprovided in Appendix 3.  Consulting inputs will be required from both firms and individuals under \nquality-  and  cost-based  selection  with  a  quality\u2013cost  ratio  of  80:20.  ADB  will  engage  all \nconsultants in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended \nfrom time to time). Equipment procured under the TA will follow the Procurement Guidelines \n(2013, as amended from time to time) and the assets will be handed over to the CDMF upon TA \ncompletion. Disbursements under the TA will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n19.  The TA includes the establishment of a small grants scheme to provide grants of around \n$50,000  to  each  selected  bus  company  to  support  the  integration  of  data  management, \nanalytical,  and  decision  support  tools  for  energy-efficient,  inclusive,  and  competitive  bus \noperations  into  their  own  ITS  (output  3).  The  small  grants  scheme  will  be  designed  and \nmanaged by the selected consultancy firm with a designated grant manager. The roles and \nduties of the grant manager will include drawing up the approval criteria and legal agreements; \nassessing the small grant application in collaboration with the CDMF; monitoring implementation \nagainst  criteria,  milestones,  and  compliance  requirements;  and  managing  finances  and \noverseeing  disbursement.  The  CDMF  will  play  a  supervisory  role  in  the  consultants\u2019 \nmanagement of the small grants scheme. It will approve all disbursements by the consultants to \nthe bus operators, and will ensure that the consultant maintains proper accounting records and \ncomplies with sound financial management principles.8 Management of the small grants scheme \nwill follow ADB guidelines on financial management. \n \n20.  The TA specifically includes mechanisms for disseminating the expected outputs and \noutcome evaluation. Output 5 will establish knowledge-sharing networks with bus operators and \nmore broadly though the CBL program, ADB STI, the ASTUD, the GEF, and other international \nnetworks. The consultants will manage the budgets for training and knowledge-sharing activities \nusing ADB guidelines on finance management and the terms of the consultancy contract. \n \nIV.
