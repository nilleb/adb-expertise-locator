INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of the Maldives (Government) requested the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) to provide technical assistance (TA)1 for preparing a small- and medium-sized enterprise \n(SME)2  project  to  reduce  regional  income  inequalities  through  economic  growth  and \ndiversification. Regional development and enhancement of private sector participation are the \nkey  objectives  of  economic  development  under  the  Sixth  National  Development  Plan. \nAccordingly, the country strategy and program update for the Maldives (2004\u20132006)3 includes a \nTA for preparing the Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise Development Project.4 TA fact-finding \nmissions fielded in September and November 2005 held discussions with key Government \nministries, financial institutions, SMEs, prospective entrepreneurs, and development partners. \nThis report reflects the missions\u2019 findings and the understanding reached with the Government \non objectives, scope, cost, implementation arrangements, and terms of reference for the TA. \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The Maldives has made significant progress in recent years. Gross domestic product \n(GDP) more than doubled during the decade ending in 2004, and all key social indicators made \nnotable  progress.  Economic  progress,  however,  has  been  uneven  and  regional  income \ndisparities have widened. The disparities were further accentuated by the devastating impact of \nthe  December  2004  tsunami  which  damaged  infrastructure,  enterprises,  and  means  of \nlivelihood.  \n \n3.  The economy is service-oriented, with 80% of GDP in 2004 supported by tertiary sector \nactivities\u2014tourism  (33%),  transport  and  communications  (15%),  wholesale  and  retail  trade \n(4%), financial (3%), real estate (8%), other business services (3%), government administration \n(12%), and social services (2%). The private sector accounted for about 60% of GDP in 2004 \nand roughly two thirds5 of domestic employment. The main sectors, including tourism, fishing, \nand telecommunications, are dominated by a few large companies. SMEs and microenterprises \nare mainly informal and concentrated in small trade and low-end manufacturing, characterized \nby meager value addition.  \n \n4.  Although the private sector presence is encouraging in the tourism sector, and the \nfishing  and  telecommunications  sectors  which  have  opened  up  recently,  an  enabling \nenvironment for the private sector in general, and for SMEs in particular, is required across the \neconomy. The absence of a coordinated strategy and framework that links policies, laws, and \ninstitutional  support,  and  enhances  access  to  finance,  skills,  and  markets,  impedes  the \ncontribution of private sector development (PSD) and SME development to economic growth \nand job creation. Inadequacies are most obvious in ownership and property rights, access to \nfinance, skills availability, registration, and licensing. The significant presence of the public \nsector and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in commercial activities also affects PSD and SME \ndevelopment.  \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 20 October 2005. \n2  The Maldives has no official definition of SME and microenterprises. These terms connotes enterprises that are \nbeing operated or could be initiated either by individual upper-to- and middle- income households, or by individual \nor groups of low- income households or groups of such households. \n3  ADB. 2003. Maldives: Country Strategy and Program Update (2004\u20132006).): Maldives. Manila. \n4  Due to changes in priorities in the wake of the tsunami, the Government has requested the Small and Medium-\nSized Enterprise Development in the Atolls Project be programmed for 2008. \n5  Estimates based on employment data as presented in the Statistical Yearbook of Maldives, 2004. \n ", " 2 \n \n5.  All land and property rights over natural resources are vested in the Government. Land \nis not sold for any use but is leased for commercial purposes. The Government has vested \nmanagement of land to four agencies, which apply different policies, directives, and guidelines \nwhen allocating land for use in their areas. Use of buildings and other permanent structures as \ncollateral  without  clear  title  to  the  land  compromises  legal  remedies  against  default.  The \ndisposal of tenure rights is not yet subject to a holistic policy. The time, cost, and uncertainty of \nestablishing claim to secure payment of credit, prioritizing claims, and foreclosing affects access \nto credit and increases risk premiums. The economic potential of using collateral to secure \nfinancial transactions is not fully advantaged to increase output and employment. \n \n6.  The  financial  sector  is  narrow  and  dominated  by  five  commercial  banks.  Nonbank \nfinancial institutions consist of a provident fund, a finance leasing company, two registered \ninsurance companies, some agents for overseas insurance companies, a specialized housing \nfinance institution, and money service businesses. Access to credit and other banking products \nis constrained by geography and a population dispersed across 200 islands. Only the Bank of \nMaldives offers branch service outside the capital city\u201412 island subbranches and 5 mobile \nbanking units,6 with nonbank financial institutions entirely limited to offices in Male. On the \nsupply side, financial institutions report high transaction costs7 and limited number of bankable \nSMEs as major impediments to expanding service coverage. On the demand side, the key \nconstraint is the high cost of credit, particularly for SMEs.  \n \n7.  While  the  active  labor  force  constitutes  about  55%  of  the  total  population,  and  in \naccordance with the 2000 census the unemployment rate is about 2%, skills that could enable \nequitable participation in economic growth are lacking. Educational and vocational institutions \nhave not inculcated enterprise as a career option or provided appropriate business orientation \nand support skills. Hiring more expatriates8 to solve the skill mismatch raises the cost of doing \nbusiness. In addition, the labor market is inadequately regulated. While the passage of the \nLabor  Bill  will  address  regulation,  a  minimum  wage  may  adversely  affect  PSD  and  SME \ndevelopment. \n \n8.  Trade and manufacturing sectors offer opportunities for SME development. However, \nthe trade sector already has a concentration of competitive SMEs. The manufacturing sector, \nother than fish processing, primarily consists of a few modern foreign-owned garment factories \nand other small businesses.9 Thus, the challenge is diversification and identification of further \nopportunities,  particularly  those  that  will  support  growth  in  the  atolls.  However,  business \ndevelopment services (BDS), including financial, marketing, and skill development services,10 \nwhich could facilitate diversification and help mitigate the skill deficit through demand-based \ncapacity development, do not target SMEs\u2019 needs and are not affordable, if offered at all. The \nlack of BDS is felt acutely in fisheries and agriculture, which support a large part of the country, \nparticularly where the tourism has not yet reached or is unlikely to reach. Both sectors are key \npillars of the Government\u2019s plan for domestic investment and job creation. \n \n                                                 \n6  The almost 200 inhabited islands are assured access to banking services at least once a month. \n7  In addition to high logistical/operational costs involved in providing financial services to the atolls, regulated banks \nunder regulation must maintain 30% minimum reserves requirements.  \n8  In 2003, expatriates comprised about approximately 12% of the total population and held one-third of total formal \njobs. \n9  Other activities include food processing and bottling; herbal medicine; construction materials/supplies (cement, \nconcrete blocks, roofing, aluminum doors/windows, and electrical panels); furniture making; and boat construction. \n10  Including financial, technical, marketing, and skills development services.  \n ", "  3\n9.  The procedure for registering business entities, and the regulatory regime for tourism, \nfisheries,  construction,  and  services,  including  licensing  and  investment  approval,  are \ncumbersome for SMEs. SME development is also impeded by implicit and explicit barriers to \nentry because of the significant presence of SOEs11 in the main sectors and by a geographically \nisolated and dispersed market. SOEs receive implicit subsidies in the form of exemption from \npayment of rent for the Government land they occupy, monopoly privileges where there is scope \nfor competition, and government guarantees for their loans. Yet, some SOEs incur losses \nbecause of mismanagement, social overhead, and inefficiency. \n \n10.  The  small size  of  the  economy,  the  threat of  private  monopolies,  and  the  region\u2019s \nremoteness (and thus high transport cost) make extensive privatization difficult in the medium \nterm. Nevertheless, competition could be promoted through private ownership and private\u2013\npublic partnerships in activities such as hotels, catering, and transport services, airports, and \nports. Since the SOEs are small by international standards, their restructuring could be used to \npromote SMEs, particularly where outsourcing and immediate privatization are possible. PSD \nwill be significantly enhanced by promoting competition, efficiency, financial discipline, and good \ncorporate governance in SOEs. Taxing profit and weaning SOEs away from budgetary support \nand indirect subsidies should be part of leveling the playing field.  \n \n11.  Replicating  the  experience  of  private  sector-led  growth  in  tourism,  fishing,  and \ntelecommunications is a Government priority. The Government is cognizant that mainstreaming \nprivate  sector  participation  in  all  economic  sectors,  particularly  SME  development,  and \nrestructuring SOEs are critical. More accessible and affordable products and efficient operation \nresulting from greater competition will reduce economic inequalities and enable the Government \nto reduce SOE budgetary expenses.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The TA\u2019s desired impact is to enhance SME growth and competitiveness and increase \nthe private sector\u2019s role in accelerating economic growth and poverty reduction, especially in the \natolls. The TA\u2019s objective is to help the Government and ADB prepare and finalize the project \ndesign, emphasizing a development framework for PSD and SME, BDS and technical support \nfor SMEs, entrepreneurial opportunities for the poor, and SOE restructuring.  \n \n13.  The TA will help develop policy, regulatory, and institutional reforms to be supported by \nthe  project.  The  TA  will  help  the  Government  (i)  prepare  an  SME  development  strategy, \ntargeting the atolls and outer islands; (ii) design technical support to strengthen the policy \nframework and enabling environment for SME development; (iii) develop SME business support \nnetworks as well as improve access to affordable BDS, financial services, and financing; (iv) \nidentify, access, and support entrepreneurial and job opportunities for economically vulnerable \npeople in the atolls; and (v) prepare a strategy and plan to privatize and restructure SOEs, \nidentifying and prioritizing opportunities for their development and SME participation. The TA \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1, and the initial poverty and social sector \nanalysis is in Appendix 2. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n11 There are 19 state-owned enterprises in the following sectors: public utilities; tourism; fish processing and export, \nimport, wholesale, and retail of general merchandise; transport and communications; and social services.   \n ", " 4 \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The TA will be implemented in a programmatic yet flexible manner. The TA is structured \ninto four components: \n \n(i)  Component 1 focuses on preparing a strategy and time-bound action plan to \nfacilitate PSD and SME initiatives, activities, and market access particularly in the \natolls  by  assessing  the  policy  and  legal  environment  and  availability  and \naccessibility of BDS.  \n(ii)  Component 2 focuses on designing technical support to strengthen the enabling \nenvironment for PSD and SME development, and to develop SME BDS and \nsupport networks.  \n(iii)  Component 3 focuses on generating entrepreneurial and job opportunities for \neconomically vulnerable people in the atolls. \n(iv)  Component 4 focuses on preparing a strategy and time-bound action plan for \nSOE  privatization  and  restructuring  based  on  assessment  of  SOEs\u2019  (a) \ncontribution to the national interest, (b) natural monopoly features, (c) viability, \nand (d) potential to offer opportunities for SME development.  \n \n15.  The TA will be implemented in three phases. Workshops will enable broad participation, \nand involve central ministries and agencies as well as representatives from the atolls and \nislands, private sector, nongovernment organizations, and other development partners. During \nphase 1 or the inception phase (1 month), priority activities, in addition to defining the role of \ncounterpart agencies and preparing an implementation plan, will include: (i) assessment of the \nGovernment\u2019s strategy to foster private sector-led growth, and a review of the findings and \nrecommendations of studies on PSD and SME development and externally-funded activities; \nand (ii) a detailed mapping of externally-funded activities for PSD and SME development. Phase \n2 (10 months) will focus on the assessments and analyses for developing the strategies and \napproaches for all components. A detailed breakup of activities and milestones is in the TA \ndesign and monitoring framework (Appendix 1) and the outline terms of reference (Appendix 4). \nConsultations  throughout  the  process  will  ensure  endorsement  of  the  Government, \nstakeholders, and ADB of the scope and contents of the strategies. During phase 3 (1 month), \nthe outcomes of phases 1 and 2 will be consolidated to design the project with a realistic and \nimplementable scope and appropriately sequenced and linked reforms.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The cost of the TA is estimated at $720,000 equivalent, consisting of $600,000 in foreign \nexchange and $120,000 equivalent in local currency. ADB will provide $600,000 to finance the \nentire foreign exchange cost. The Government will contribute about $120,000 equivalent in kind. \nThe TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The detailed cost \nestimates and financing arrangements are in Appendix 3. The Government has been informed \nthat TA approval does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The Ministry of Finance and Treasury will be the Executing Agency. A TA steering \ncommittee will be established, chaired by the Ministry of Atolls Development (MOAD). It will \nmeet once every 3 months and will include senior officials from the ministries of finance and \ntreasury, economic development and trade, agriculture and fisheries, and higher education and \nemployment, and from the Maldives Monetary Authority. The Ministry of Atolls Development will \n ", "  5\nbe the main implementing agency and the ministries of economic development and trade and \nhigher education and employment will implement pilot activities, as required.  \n \n18.  The TA is expected to commence in February 2006 and completed by February 2007. \nTA  implementation  requires  14  person-months  of  international  and  27  person-months  of \ndomestic consulting services. Terms of reference for consulting services are in Appendix 4. The \nPSD and SME specialist (international) will be the team leader and will be assisted by the SME \nfinancing, SME BDS, and SOE privatization and restructuring specialists. Domestic consultants \ninclude  PSD  and  SME,  SME  financing,  legal,  and  SME  sector  specialists  (tourism,  trade, \nfishing, agriculture, services sector, and manufacturing). Twelve person-months of domestic \nconsulting  services  will  be  defined  during  implementation,  depending  on  the  scope  of \nassessment of SOE restructuring and privatization as part of component 4. An international firm \nwill provide the international and domestic consultants. The TA consultant will be selected and \nengaged in accordance with Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by ADB and its Borrowers \nand other arrangements satisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic consultants. To \nselect the firm, the quality- and cost-based selection method with simplified technical proposals \nwill be used. All procurement under the TA will be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement. Equipment procured in accordance with ADB's procurement guidelines will be \nturned over to the government on completion of the TA. \n  \n19.  The TA consultant will prepare (i) an inception report including a detailed work program, \nto be submitted within 30 days after the TA starts and to be discussed at the initial tripartite \nreview meeting; (ii) quarterly progress reports on all components, indicating work progress, the \nwork program for the next quarter, and any outstanding issues; (iii) an interim report, presenting \ndraft outputs, to be submitted within 5 months after the TA starts, to be discussed at the interim \ntripartite review meeting; (iv) a draft final report compiling all TA activities and consultants\u2019 \nrecommendations, to be submitted at least 1 month before TA completion and to be discussed \nat the final tripartite review meeting; and (v) a final report at TA completion.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of the technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis \nto  the  Government  of  the  Maldives  for  preparing  the  Small  and  Medium-Sized  Enterprise \nDevelopment Project, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "  6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact       \nEnhanced economic growth,  Improved economic growth  Ministry of Finance and  Assumptions \nincreased private sector  in regions outside the  Treasury (MOFT) economic  \u2022 Macroeconomic stability \nparticipation, and improved  capital, Male  statistics and reports  \u2022 Successful tsunami \ndistribution of benefits of      reconstruction efforts \neconomic growth to poor  Reduced role and number  National accounts statistics  \u2022 Government commitment to \nregions  of state-owned enterprises    implement policy reform \n(SOEs)   National development plan  measures and action plans in \n  support of private sector \nIncrease in number of  development (PSD) and SME \nsmall- and medium-sized  sector development \nenterprises (SMEs)   \u2022 Government capacity to adopt \n  and implement agreed-on \npolicy reforms and to \nimplement plans \n \nRisk \n\u2022 Unforeseen external shocks \n\u2022 Resistance to reforms  \n \nOutcome       \nA comprehensive project  By the end of the technical  TA steering committee  Assumptions \ndesign for ADB financing to  assistance (TA), a  meetings  \u2022 Quality outputs delivered on \nenhance PSD and strengthen  rigorously designed project    time \nSMEs in the atolls  with a sequenced and  TA consultant report   \u2022 Government endorsement of \nlinked reform agenda for    the final design  \nPSD and SME  Stakeholder feedback   \u2022 Continued Government \ndevelopment     commitment to implement \n  Tripartite reviews   policy reforms  \nGovernment and ADB     \nendorsement and  ADB review missions  Risk \nacceptance of the design     \u2022 Ability of the Ministry of \n    Finance and Treasury to \n  coordinate effectively with all \nthe agencies involved \n \nOutputs       \nPSD and SME strategy and a  Timely fielding of qualified  TA steering committee  Assumptions \ntime-bound action plan with  consultants  meetings  \u2022 The Government will provide \nfocus on development in the      adequate counterpart staff \natolls prepared.

Pursuing prudent macroeconomic policies, \nthe Maldives has achieved remarkable progress over the past 30 years. Per capita income rose from less than $100 in \nthe 1970s to about $2,500 in 2003. However, as cited in the ADB\u2019s Poverty Partnership Agreement with the \nGovernment, incomes in Male are generally two and a half times higher than in the atolls.
