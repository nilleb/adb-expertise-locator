The Government\u2019s Strategic Plan for the Papua New Guinea (PNG) Health Sector 2006\u2013\n20081 was developed recognizing the significant areas of reform outlined in three key foundation \ndocuments: (i) the Government of PNG Medium-Term Development Strategy  2005\u20132010 (MTDS), \n(ii) the National Health Plan 2001\u20132010, and (iii) the National Department of Health (NDOH) \nMedium-Term Expenditure Framework. In tandem, under the Government\u2019s priorities for public \nsector reform,2 the first priority addresses the urgent need to reduce costs and waste in national \nand provincial government administrations, and to correct the underlying weaknesses that fail to \ncontrol spending and prevent waste. Creating fiscal space is a principal tenet in the MTDS. \nIdentified as a core objective of the public sector reform program is the \"right sizing\" of the public \nsector with a view to making service delivery more affordable and efficient.3\n \n2.  The MTDS recognizes primary health care as a fundamental requirement for both social \nand economic development. As such, the focus of health expenditure over the medium term \nremains on primary and preventive health care, with priority accorded to services in rural areas. \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n3.  The  programming  discussions  in  2005  between  the  Government  and  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) identified the decline in the delivery of basic health services and rural \nhealth infrastructure as a core issue to be addressed through a potential project for ADB financing, \nand a project preparatory technical assistance (TA) was included in ADB\u2019s country strategy and \nprogram update 2005\u20132006.4 In both the reconnaissance5 and theTA fact-finding6 missions, the \nGovernment concurred with the TA impact and outcome targets, and the key activities under the \nproposed  TA.  A  presentation7  to  NDOH  senior  executive  management  and  to  development \npartners revealed both strong support and some reservations, resulting in the proposed project \npreparatory  TA  being  requalified as  advisory  TA.  Additional  consultations  were  held  with  the \nAustralian  Agency  for  International  Development  (AusAID)  and  the  New  Zealand  Agency  for \nInternational Development (NZAID), and the TA subsequently found support with  NDOH\u2019s Health \nSector Program Committee.8  Importantly, the recent PNG Independent Health and Monitoring \nReview Group findings and recommendations9 are in agreement with this TA. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  The overall deterioration in health status since the 1990s is attributable in part to the \nincreasing nonperformance of the public health system, especially in rural areas and at the district \n                                                 \n1  The Strategic Plan for the PNG Health Sector 2006\u20132008 establishes four public health strategic directions: (i) fully \nimmunize every child under 1 year old, (ii) reduce malaria prevalence in  malaria endemic districts, (iii) reduce \nmaternal mortality in the districts with high maternal deaths, and (iv) reduce rate of increase in HIV and sexually \ntransmitted infections (STI). The public health strategic directions are further supported by two management strategic \ndirections: (i) improve the leadership and management of the public health sector to achieve public health strategic \ndirections, and (ii) improve the organizational performance of  NDOH and provinces to support public health sector \nstrategic directions. \n2  Government of Papua New Guinea. 2003.

Rural health services were found to be in a state of \u201cslow breakdown and collapse\u201d in a 2001 \nreview.10  Rural health care infrastructure and staffing management are declining. For example, \nover 300 aid posts were closed between 1995 and 2000, affecting mainly people in lower asset \nquintiles and those living in remote areas; there are fewer doctors and health extension officers \n(HEOs) at  rural health facilities and fewer community health workers (CHWs)  working in aid \nposts\u2015a 25% reduction between 1987 and 2000. Ambulatory care is decreasing and will have a \nnegative impact on health outcomes. The number of outpatient visits per person per annum \ndeclined from 2.39 in 1988 to 1.49 in 2003. The reduction in access to ambulatory care combined \nwith declining infrastructure is likely to contribute to poorer health outcomes. \n \n5.  The capacity of provincial and district governments to deliver quality health services to their \nrural populations has declined and continues to do so. An important factor in this decline has been \nthe  successive  attempts  to  decentralize  the  provision  of  services.  In  particular,  the  aid  post \nsystem\u2015designed  to  reach  the  most  remote  rural  populations\u2015has  suffered  from  a  lack  of \ncommitment from both provincial and district governments and national government efforts to \nreduce casual staff in times of fiscal crisis.  The closure of aid posts is continuing: while 75% of the \noriginal number of aid posts was still open in 1995, only 63% were open in 2000. Data for \nsubsequent  years  is  problematic,  but  the  trend  is  believed  to  be  continuing  and  may  be \naccelerating.  As the coverage of basic services shrinks, unmet demand from rural populations is \nincreasing.   \n \n6.   NDOH,  with  central  agencies  and  development  partner  support,  is  progressively \nimplementing a sectorwide approach (SWAp). While the overall strategy to strengthen NDOH and \nprovincial-level management and to focus on a small number of core programs is essential, it may \nnot be sufficient to produce the desired outcomes. To avert the consequences of a gradually \ndisappearing public health system, greater attention will be necessary at the district and community \nlevels, drawing on consultation and participation strategies to challenge prevailing attitudes and \ninstill a sense of ownership. Recognizing the condition and performance of rural health services is \nnot uniform across the nation; local solutions should be developed for local issues. Where rural \nhealth services are well supported and functioning, additional and complementary support would \nbe appropriate. In villages where access to health services is limited, or where aid posts have long \nbeen closed, grassroots consultations should be undertaken to establish the underlying causes \nand suggest possible new arrangements that would deliver health services at the village level. \n \n7.  The difficulties experienced by provincial, district, and local level governments to supervise, \nsupport, and manage the aid post workforce and to retain functioning health workers in the public \nsystem have resulted in a costly but poorly performing public health system. One option to help \nachieve the desired primary health outcomes for which the aid post system is responsible would be \nto share their functions with a cadre of independent practitioners at the village level and supported \nby village oversight. Many health workers currently lost to the system are providing informal, \nunrecognized, and unsupported services, often in their native village. An opportunity exists to \nexamine informal rural health service mechanisms, their performance, viability, and acceptance by \nrural primary stakeholders. The initial poverty and social analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  Implementation of the recommendations in the final report will lead to the improved health \nof rural populations through the achievement of the health-related Millennium Development Goals \n                                                 \n10   Public Sector Reform Management Unit. 2001.

Health  sector  performance  will  be  improved  by  halting,  then \nreversing the decline in rural-based health services. Support will be provided in close collaboration \nwith NDOH; central agencies; and provincial, district and local governments to strengthen the \ndelivery of rural health services under NDOH\u2019s current and future strategic plans on the basis of (i) \nstructural and policy reform to reverse the decline in available health services at the village level; (ii) \nhuman resource development and management; (iii) procurement, distribution, and availability of \nessential  pharmaceutical  supplies  in  all  rural  areas;  and  (iv)  building  the  capacity  of  NDOH \nmanagement to cover the above areas, and monitoring and evaluation through support of the \nNational Health Information System (NHIS). A possible future project could be in the form of a 15-\nyear, multitranche sector development program including program and project financing, and with \nbilateral and/or multilateral cofinancing. \n \n9.  The outcome of the TA will be a report with key recommendations obtained through a \ndiagnostic process examining the demand for health services among rural populations and the  \ncauses of the government\u2019s failure  to deliver public health services. The core activities to produce \nthis outcome include (i) establishing the status of rural health services in at least six districts to \nserve as a basis for policy formulation, (ii) conducting consultations and participatory planning to \ndetermine grassroots\u2019 perceptions and demand for village-based health services, (iii) reviewing the \nconditions and capacity of NDOH and central agency systems to support rural health infrastructure \nand basic services delivery, (iv) reviewing and evaluating current ongoing strategies and activities \ndesigned to reverse the current decline in rural health infrastructure and basic services delivery, (v) \ndetermining the support and strengthening needed by NDOH and central agency systems to \nreverse the decline in rural health infrastructure, and (vi) preparing a final report for consideration \nof the Government and development partners. Following the diagnostic stage, the TA will focus on \nthe areas of human resource (HR) policy and development, HR management in rural settings, \nlogistics  and  support  mechanisms  for  rural  health  staff,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation  for \nmanagement  purposes.  The  recommendations  will  also  address  existing  initiatives  and  their \npossible support and integration. Required SWAp arrangements to support a long-term initiative to \nrestore rural health services will be examined with a view to improve the current health SWAp and \nstrengthen government and development partner collaboration. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The assessment of the current state of rural health services will cover at least six districts: \ntwo remote and disadvantaged districts, two of average standing, and two well-performing districts. \nThe districts will also be representative of the country\u2019s four regions. Village-based consultations \nwill be organized and seek to determine local issues and potential solutions from a grassroots \nperspective in planned collaboration with TA 6319.11 Local-level and provincial governments will \nparticipate in the process. Workshops will be held with government and development partner \nstakeholders to assist in policy dialogue and reformulation of rural public health systems and \nsupport arrangements that respond to the rural populations\u2019 needs and are viable in the long term. \nDiverse diagnoses and multiple proposed solutions are anticipated. The Government\u2019s District \nServices Improvement Program may provide the means for developing long-term support of rural \nhealth services. \n \n11.  Ongoing rural health service delivery reform and improvement efforts operating in PNG will \nbe reviewed for their impact on improving health service delivery in a sustainable manner.

In-service  training,  an  NDOH  responsibility,  will  be  reexamined  in  light  of  establishing \ntraining mechanisms and facilities to support rural-based health workers and potentially a program \nto select and train community-supported health workers to practice in their home or spouse\u2019s \nvillage. Several possibilities will be examined, including (i) the opening, management, and financial \nviability of the Laloki in-service training facility;12 and (ii) contracting nursing officer training schools \nand community health worker training schools, many operated by faith-based organizations (FBOs), \nto upgrade the skills of selected candidates and to maintain their skills through periodic in-service \ntraining. \n \n13.  A system for procuring and distributing aid post medicine kits has operated since 1998. \nWhile there are remaining issues, in particular the distribution of kits to the respective aid posts, \nrural health services\u2500where they are still open and operational\u2500have usually been adequately \nsupplied with essential medicines. System improvements, especially internal control mechanisms, \nand  the  possible  extension  of  the  system  to  village  level-independent  practitioners,  with  due \nattention  paid  to  lessons  learned,  would  constitute  a  government  subsidy  to  primary  health \nservices at the village level. Once operational, the distribution network could also provide a conduit \nfor preventive health care goods and services and health promotion activities. \n \n14.  Appropriate and sustainable supervisory mechanisms will be examined and developed. \nVillage council participation in selecting and assigning health workers who seek to establish a \npractice in their native or spouse\u2019s village would allow for community oversight mechanisms. \nDistricts being developed under the District Services Improvement Program may also be qualified \nto undertake an appropriate supervisory role. \n \n15.  Establishing  new  HR  arrangements  for  rural  health  services  would  require  NDOH  to \ndemonstrate leadership by setting the right example. Attempts over the years to improve  the \nperformance of NDOH\u2019s Human Resource Branch have been less than successful. The attempts \nwere usually tied to projects of short duration. The longer term sector program approach offers \nopportunities, given the measured pace required to undertake lasting reforms.  The Government\u2019s \nConcept payroll system would be strengthened to improve accuracy and governance as well as to \nproduce standard and reliable HR management information.  The new arrangements would also \npresent  the  opportunity  to  introduce  modern  licensing  practices  for  both  government  and \nindependent health workers. \n \n16.  The performance of NHIS under NDOH\u2019s Monitoring, Research and Evaluation Branch is \ngradually deteriorating in the absence of supervision and HR management, as well as inadequate \nattention paid to logistics, computer and skills upgrading. The information reported by NHIS is of \ncritical importance to HR management and in measuring performance against the strategic plans. \nLong-term sustained support and development may be appropriate and will be examined under the \nproposed TA. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $944,000 equivalent. The amount of $850,000 equivalent will \nbe financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan.

The Government has been advised that approval of the \nTA does not commit ADB to financing any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  NDOH will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The TA will be guided by the Health Sector \nProgram  Committee,  a  Health  Sector  Improvement  Program  (HSIP)  management  committee, \nwhich includes director-level NDOH members and development partner representatives. The TA \nwill also report to various government and development partner bodies as needed, including the \nbiannual Government-Development Partner Health Summit. The HSIP Management Branch will \nprovide support in the day-to-day activities of the TA and in coordinating with other stakeholders. \nNDOH will provide logistical support to the consultants such as providing them with necessary data \nand organizing appointments. \n \n19.  Continued participation of AusAID, NZAID, World Health Organization (WHO), and other \nbilateral, multilateral, and United Nations (UN) development partners supporting the Government\u2019s \nhealth SWAp will be sought.  The scope and duration of an eventual program will necessitate \nbroad-based  support  and  cofinancing.  Incorporating  a  large-scale  program  into  the  HSIP  is \nexpected to strengthen the HSIP, lending it both greater predictability and stability. \n \n20.  The TA will require a minimum of 18 person-months of international and 20 person-months \nof  national  consulting  services  to  carry  out  the  study.  The  areas  of  expertise  include  health \nsystems analysis and development, consultation and participation of stakeholders, and economic \nanalysis. Appendix 4 gives the outline terms of reference. \n \n21.  The TA will be carried out by an international consulting firm in association with a national \nfirm or a team of national individual consultants. The firm will be engaged in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (April 2006, as amended from time to time), using the \nquality-based selection method (QBS) and a simplified technical proposal (STP). The QBS is \njustified because of the exploratory nature of the TA, and the technical and economic uncertainty \nassociated with the project. The consultants will supply ADB and the Government with six copies of \nthe inception report and final report. An electronic version will also be provided. \n \n22.  The TA will be implemented over a 12-month period including an initial diagnostic phase \ninvolving  consultation  and  participation  of  rural  populations,  and  health  systems  evaluations, \nfollowed by the recommendations/design phase using the HSIP, and in collaboration with all health \nsector stakeholders.  The TA will begin in March 2007 and end February 2008. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n23.  The  President,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  by  the  Board,  has  approved  the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $850,000 on a grant basis to the \nGovernment of Papua New Guinea for Health Sector Support, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard. \n \n \n \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  and Risks  \nMechanisms  \nImpact       Assumption \n\u2022  Reduced child  \u2022  PNG adjusted MDG  \u2022  MDG reports produced by  \u2022  Long-term social, \nmortality (MDG 4)  indicators and targets  UNDP  economic, and political \n\u2022  Improved maternal  \u2022  DHS  stability maintained \nhealth (MDG 5)     \n \n\u2022  HIV/AIDS, malaria, \n \nand other diseases \n \nunder control (MDG  \n6) \nOutcome      Assumption \n\u2022  Broad-based policy  \u2022  NDOH and HSIP  \u2022  Final report submitted  \u2022  Sustained commitment \ndiscussions between  endorsed    of government, \ngovernment and  recommendations by    development partners, \ndevelopment partners  March 2008    and other stakeholders \ninformed by a road    to proposed reforms \nmap for policy reform \nand an investment \nplan \nOutputs      Assumptions \n\u2022 A report defining a  \u2022  An initial draft report  \u2022  Consultant report  \u2022  Consistent political will \ncomprehensive reform  submitted 4 months  and clear leadership \nprocess including  after consultant  arrangements by \nADB\u2019s participation in  deployment  Government \nrestoring basic health     \nservices to PNG\u2019s rural  \u2022  A final draft report  \u2022  Continued cooperation \npopulations  completed within 12  of government agencies \n  months of project  and stakeholders \nstart   \nRisks \n\u2022  Lack of support from \nrelevant government \nagencies \n \n\u2022  Disruptions and delays \ndue to 2007 national \nelections \nActivities with Milestones  Inputs \n1.1.

The principal challenges to poverty reduction in PNG are the \nrestoration of economic growth and the continued provision of basic services. Those are also the priorities of the poor \nidentified during the participatory assessment of hardship in 2001, namely access to jobs and income opportunities, \nand improved service delivery and infrastructure. \n \nThe Department of Health and stakeholders, including the Asian Development Bank (ADB), agree to a core set of \nissues  that  undermine  the  health  status  of  the  PNG  population.  These  are  limited  resources,  deteriorating \ninfrastructure, and inadequate and declining access to basic health services. These issues are exacerbated by \nwidespread inefficient management, low staff morale, and poor community support for health services. Individuals and \ncommunities are not encouraged to improve and maintain their own health. \n \nSupport for the health sector is an integral part of the strategy to strengthen the delivery of basic services, especially \nto the rural poor. \n \n \nB.

Many rural \naid posts have closed across the nation; loss of health infrastructure is also reported to include health centers, both \ngovernment and church-based. The incapacity to supervise and manage the aid post workforce and to retain \nfunctioning health workers in the public system has increased costs and resulted in a nonperforming system.   \n \nThe purpose of the TA is to support the government in addressing the decline in basic health services throughout rural \nPNG. The project proposes to selectively address this issue under new arrangements that promote both improved and \nsustainable  management  and  oversight,  and  greater  ownership  of  health  services  by  staff,  communities,  and \nindividuals. Local solutions will be developed with the participation of all stakeholders; innovative arrangements will be \nconsidered and adopted where appropriate. \n \nPoverty analysis will help ensure that the investments are pro-poor, the poor and disadvantaged groups benefit \nproportionately, and the project reduces the vulnerability of the poor and disadvantaged groups. The analysis should \nalso include a needs assessment that (i) identifies the existing burden of disease of the poor and disadvantaged \ngroups and possible strategies to optimize their use of services; and (ii) assesses the current capacity of the health \nsystem to effectively address their health needs. The analysis should also examine public-private partnership \narrangements to enhance the sustainability of the regional delivery of basic health services. \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nA stakeholder analysis is required to identify key project stakeholders, their project-related interests, and the ways in \nwhich they affect project feasibility and success. Primary stakeholders include representatives from the rural poor and \nvulnerable groups at the village level, selected health staff, union representatives, representatives of local churches, \nand nongovernment organizations. Secondary stakeholders would include decentralized government and relevant \ncentral  government  agencies,  and  development  partners.  A  Consultation  and  Participation  (C&P)  plan  will  be \ndeveloped under the TA. \n ", "10   Appendix 2 \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nA participation strategy will be required to establish the new village-level service delivery arrangements, and define the \nnature and levels of cooperation and collaboration of the many stakeholders.  This will help ensure strong political \nsupport, ownership through active consultation with and participation of groups concerned, productive feedback, and \nthe necessary long-term sustainability to achieve the project impact. \n \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nIn  the  consultation  and  participation  process,  village-based  women  will  be  addressed  as  a  separate  primary \nstakeholder group, insulated from outside pressures. \n \n \nHas an output been prepared?
