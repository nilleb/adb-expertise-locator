The capacity of the system to meet \nthe needs of the labor market is small. Employers are looking for \nmore  workers  who  can  meet  their  semiskilled  and  skilled \nrequirements. The outputs of the TVET system and the needs of \nthe employment sectors are mismatched in at least three areas: \n(i)  trades  or  occupations  where  programs  are  offered, \n(ii)  competencies  acquired  do  not  meet  industry  or  self-\nemployment  requirements,  and  (iii)  practical  experience \nopportunities  for  students.  The  practical  component  of  the \ncurriculum is not effectively taught. The majority of TVET teachers \nlack  pedagogical  training  and  practical  skills,  and  have  no \nindustrial experience. In addition, TVET institutions have poorly \nequipped workshops; and lack teaching and training materials, \nand adequate classrooms and workshops. \n \nThe  formal  TVET  system  provides  limited  opportunities  to  the \nprimary target beneficiaries of the NPRS. Successful completion \nof  class  (or  grade)  8  is  required  for  entry  into  formal  TVET \nprograms in the secondary school certificate (vocational) and thus \nexcludes the majority of the poor. Its main clientele are young \nadolescents who complete class 8, can afford to stay more years \nin school, and have strong white-collar job aspirations.  \n \nThe NPRS calls for a reform of the TVET system to make it more \nmarket-responsive; address training needs of the underprivileged \nwho do not complete class 8; collaborate with the private sector \nand nongovernment organizations (NGOs); and make its training \nprograms  more  flexible  in  terms  of  duration,  curriculum  and \nstudents\u2019 academic qualifications, among others.  \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The Project\u2019s impact will be increased wage- and self-employment \nof graduates of skills training. The Project supports the NPRS to \nreduce  poverty  and  promote  economic  growth  by  providing \nmarket-relevant skills training to more Bangladeshis, including the \npoor and disadvantaged \n \nThe Project\u2019s envisioned outcome is strengthened capacity of the \nTVET system to provide market-responsive, short-term, relevant \nskills training to more Bangladeshis, including those who have not \ncompleted class 8. The Project will be implemented throughout \nthe country.  \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The investment cost of the Project is estimated at $66.7 million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $7.8 million.   \n   \n ", "  iii\nFinancing Plan  A loan of $50,000,000 in various currencies equivalent to Special \nDrawing  Rights  (SDR)  30,741,000  will  be  provided  from  the \nSpecial Funds resources of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nto finance 75% of the project costs. The loan will have a 32-year \nterm including a grace period of 8 years, with an interest charge of \n1%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum \nthereafter. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  1 June 2008\u201330 November 2013 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 May 2013 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Education (MOE) \n   \nImplementation  The  Directorate  of  Technical  Education  (DTE)  will  be  the \nArrangements  Implementing  Agency  and  have  overall  responsibility  to  plan, \norganize, manage, and monitor the Project, as well as monitor \nprogress.  The  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  will  be \nresponsible  for  day-to-day  project  implementation  and  overall \ncoordination among all stakeholders. The PIU will be headed by a \nfull-time project director who will be selected in consultation with \nADB. An additional project director, seconded from senior DTE \nstaff, will assume the functions for finance and administration and \npublic\u2013NGO partnership, in addition to duties as overall deputy to \nthe project director.  \n \nA project steering committee (PSC) will be formed and chaired by \nthe  MOE  secretary.  The  PSC  will  be  responsible  for  detailed \npolicy formulation, provide guidance and advice to the Project, \nand approve the Project\u2019s annual work plan. It will approve the \nselection  criteria  for  (i)  TVET  institutions  eligible  for  program \nstrengthening, (ii) market-responsive training proposals eligible for \nproject support, (iii) training providers of the market-responsive \ntraining programs to be tendered, and (iv) criteria for selecting the \n40 educational institutions that will receive a training workshop. As \nthe PSC is a large body that can only meet once a quarter, a \nproject implementation committee, chaired by the director general, \nDTE,  will  be  established  to  oversee  day-to-day  project \nimplementation. The project director will act as the committee\u2019s \nmember-secretary.  \n   \nProcurement  Procurement of goods and services will be in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to \ntime).  Disbursements  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time).  \n   \n ", "iv   \nConsulting Services  The  selection  and  engagement  of  consultants  to  be  financed \nunder the Project will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The \nconsultant  services  will  include  about  97  person-months  of \ninternational  consulting  and  260  person-months  of  national \nconsulting. International and national consulting services will be \nengaged through a firm, to be selected using the quality- and cost-\nbased  selection  method  and  a  full  technical  proposal,  in  the \nfollowing specializations: TVET policy and competency standards \ndevelopment,  competency-based  training  curriculum,  materials, \nand  assessment  tools  development,  TVET  institution \nstrengthening, TVET teacher training and planning, TVET training \nprogram design and packaging, training financing management \ndesign,  training  needs  assessment,  gender  and  indigenous \npeople,  and  procurement  and    financial  management.  The \nexternal  independent  financial  assessment  and  external \nindependent performance assessment specialists will be recruited \nindividually. \n   \nProject Benefits and  In general, the Project will initiate reform-oriented processes of \nBeneficiaries  TVET  system  operations  to  make  TVET  more  demand-driven, \nflexible, and oriented to serving the poor and disadvantaged. The \npilot model on public\u2013private sector collaboration will establish a \nlinkage  between  TVET  authorities  and  training  providers,  and \nformal  and  informal  employment  markets,  thus  minimizing  the \nmismatch  between  supply  and  demand  for  labor.  The \ndevelopment  and  use  of  competency  standards  approved  or \nrecognized by industry will introduce a new approach to the TVET \nsystem to give more value to actual competencies acquired than \nto traditional qualifications. Revitalization of the two public TVET \nteacher  training  institutions  will  support  an  expanded  teacher \ntraining system that serve the preservice and in-service teacher \ntraining  needs  of  the  government  TVET  sector,  and  those  of \nprivate and nongovernment training providers. In-service training \nof  TVET  teachers  addresses  the  immediate  need  of  TVET \nproviders to provide untrained teachers with both pedagogical and \ntechnological skills; this will contribute to improving the quality of \nskills training delivery.   \n \nThe  Project  will  help  increase  access  to  skills  training  for  the \nlarger segment of Bangladesh\u2019s population. The development of \nshort,  modular  competency-based  training  (CBT)  courses  will \nprovide greater flexibility in terms of duration and required student \nacademic  qualifications.  Offering  training  programs  not \nnecessarily requiring class 8 for enrolment will expand access to \nthe  TVET  system  to  those  that  did  not  attain  this  level  of \neducation,  many  of  whom  are  poor.  Training  workshops  in \nselected poor communities will make training more accessible. \nThus, the Project will open TVET institutions to a larger number of \ntrainees in short CBT courses, most of whom would have been \ndenied access because of the class 8 requirement for entry. \n ", "  v\n  Economic  benefits  of  the  Project  are  derived  mainly  from \n(i) increased access to skills training as a result of developing \nshort,  modular  CBT  courses;  training  delivery  support;  and \nprogram  strengthening  of  selected  TVET  institutions;  and \n(ii)  improved  relevance  and  quality  of  skills  training  through \npartnerships  with  employers,  industry,  and  NGOs;  the  related \nrevision of curricula; and provision of in-service teacher training. \nThe Project will have about 68,200 trainees over the five years of \nimplementation. The program strengthening of TVET institutions \nwill expand the intake capacity of beneficiary training institutions. \nAfter the completion of their training, graduates are expected to \nseek local or international employment or be self-employed. With \nthe  combined  efforts  to  increase  access  to  short-term  skills \ntraining programs and improve their relevance and quality, the \nproportion of trainees employed from Project-supported training \nprograms is expected to improve. Although they are not the target \nbeneficiaries of the Project, improving the quality of teaching and \npractical  training  in  vocational  subjects  is  also  expected  to \nimprove the examination pass rates and employment likelihood of \nsecondary school students in the vocational stream. Under these \nassumptions, the economic internal rate of return is estimated at \n13.9% in the base-case scenario.    \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The partnership model assumes the continued commitment and \ncooperation of the three partner industry associations and NGOs \nin the sector working committees (SWCs). Thus, the Project will \nsign  memoranda  of  understanding  and  provide  strengthening \nactivities to SWC members. The three focus industries and NGOs \nare eligible for training partnership assistance and their training \nrequirements will be supported through the provision of market-\nresponsive  skills  training.  In  addition,  the  policy  development \nactivities of the European Commission and International Labour \nOrganization  (EC\u2013ILO  project),  which  will  be  concurrently \nimplemented, will reinforce linkages with industry and coordination \nof TVET-related government agencies. \n \nImplementation of the Project\u2019s capacity development for external \ncompetency  assessment  that  will  recognize  prior  learning \nassumes that the EC\u2013ILO project activity to develop the related \npolicy and system will be at an advanced stage by the end of the \nProject\u2019s second year of implementation. The Project will closely \ncoordinate  with  the  EC\u2013ILO  project  and,  if  any  delay  is \nexperienced  in  that  project,  the  Project\u2019s  specialists  in  TVET \npolicy  and  competency  standards  development  and  CBT \ncurriculum, materials and assessment tools development will help \nprepare the draft of the relevant policy and its supporting system.  \n \nThe Project aims to provide in-service training to about 4,000 \nuntrained TVET teachers from public and private TVET providers. \nHowever,  substitute  teachers  may  not  be  available  while  the \nuntrained  teachers  are  on  training.  This  will  be  addressed  by \n ", "vi   \nmaking the training program modular, short, and continuing; and \nscheduling teacher training when student training programs are \nnot  in  session.  The  Project\u2019s  loan  assurances  provide  for \ncertification by the Bangladesh Technical Education Board of the \nin-service  teacher  training.  EC\u2013ILO  activities  in  TVET  teacher \nqualifications  and  teacher  strengthening  will  complement  this \nactivity.  \n \nThe limited scope of activities in the two public TVET teacher \ntraining institutions contributed to past underutilization. The new \napproach  to  include  a  multiparty  advisory  board;  in-service \noutreach  training;  and  training  of  staff  from  private  and  NGO \nsectors, and other ministries will help increase utilization of TVET \nfacilities.  Management  training  for  administrators  will  facilitate \naddressing the training needs of non-MOE staff. Complementary \ninputs from the Project (facilities and staff development) and the \nEC\u2013ILO project (policies and capacity strengthening) will support \nimprovements in the quality and relevance of TVET, which should \nmaintain  the  demand  for  the  preservice  and  in-service  TVET \nteacher training programs.     \n \nThe pace of implementation of market-responsive skills training \nwill depend on the PIU\u2019s capacity to identify priority and/or urgent \ntraining needs, package the corresponding training programs for \ntendering, and administer training contracts. To minimize the risk \nof delays, the Project will provide an adequate number of highly \nqualified staff, including for contracts administration, in the PIU \nand give support to the evaluation committees. The PIU will also \nbe  supported  by  international  and  national  consultants \nspecializing  in  training  financing  management  design,  training \nprogram design and packaging, and financial management.  \n   \n ", " ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Skills Development Project. (The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1). \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES1 \n2.  Despite the calamities that hit the country almost every year, Bangladesh\u2018s economic \ngrowth  averaged  5.7%  per  annum  from  2000  to  2006.2  Nonetheless,  about  half  of  the \npopulation lives below the national poverty line. While agriculture engages the majority of the \npopulation, its share in gross domestic product (GDP) is declining. Sources of economic growth \nare shifting gradually to the higher productivity industry and services sectors. Economic growth \nhas been fueled largely by export-oriented industries, mainly textiles and garments, which \naccounted for about 72% of total export earnings in 2004. Other industries experiencing robust \ngrowth include leather, leather goods, and construction. In the services sector, the industries \nposting significant growth rates include post and telecommunication, land transport, wholesale \nand retail trade, and hotels and restaurants. The national economy is buoyed by remittances \nfrom overseas Bangladeshi workers; in 2006 remittances made up the second largest source of \nforeign exchange.   \n \n3.  Economic  growth  combined  with  the  Government\u2019s  pro-poor  policies  and  programs \nresulted in significant improvement of some human development indicators, notably reduced \ninfant and maternal mortality, increased net school enrollment ratio, and achievement of gender \nparity in primary education. Primary enrollment has more than tripled since 1970 from 5.3 million \nto about 16.2 million in 2005, and the proportion of female enrollees has increased from 32% to \n50%. In 2005, the gross enrollment rate for primary education was about 93.7%.   \n \n4.  Over  half  of  Bangladesh\u2019s  working  age  population  was  in  the  labor  force  in  2003. \nWomen\u2019s labor force participation has increased notably from 1996, particularly in rural areas. \nOf those employed locally, about 80% were in the informal sector and mainly self-employed or \nday  laborers;  only  14%  were  engaged  in  wage-employment.  Most  employment  is  still  in \nagriculture,  forestry,  and  related  works  (49%),  followed  by  wholesale  and  retail  trade  and \nmanufacturing. Other relatively large employers include transport, storage, and communication \nservice;  community,  personal  service,  and  household  sector;  construction;  and  education \nservices. More Bangladeshis are seeking employment outside the country, but their share of \nemployment opportunities is small. While about half of these workers are unskilled, the number \nof semiskilled and skilled workers among those deployed is growing.  \n \n5.  Achieving  accelerated  poverty  reduction  and  related  Millennium  Development  Goal \ntargets  would  require  Bangladesh\u2019s  economy  to  grow  by  7%\u20138%  per  annum.3  Significant \ninvestment is required to achieve this. Attracting investments will require improving governance \nand streamlining bureaucratic rules and regulations, and upgrading the skills and competencies \nof human resources. The national poverty reduction strategy (NPRS) recognizes the potential \ncontribution of technical and vocational education and training (TVET) in reducing poverty while \nsupporting  economic  growth.  TVET  provides  practical  job  skills,  particularly  to  those  who \ndropped out of school early and are already of employable age, and to the large pool of \n                                                 \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB) 2006.

Manila. \n ", "2 \nunemployed and underemployed adults. The NPRS calls for reform of the TVET system to \nmake it more market-responsive; address the training needs of the underprivileged who do not \ncomplete  class  (or  grade)  8;  collaborate  with  the  private  sector  and  nongovernment \norganizations  (NGOs);  and  make  its  training  programs  more  flexible  in  terms  of  duration, \ncurriculum,  and  students\u2019  academic  qualifications,  among  others.  Appendix  2  provides  an \nanalysis of the TVET subsector. \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n6.  In 2006, the World Bank conducted a tracer study involving more than 2,300 graduates \nof basic trade, certificate and diploma courses of public and private TVET institutions. The \nhighest proportions of employed were among the higher secondary certificate (vocational) (HSC \n[Voc]) graduates at 30%, followed by diploma graduates at 21%, and basic trades at 18%. \nThese courses, however, account for only a small proportion of total formal TVET enrollment. \nThe lowest proportions of employed were among the secondary school certificate (vocational) \n(SSC  [Voc])  graduates  (4%)  and  higher  secondary  certificate  (business  management) \ngraduates (5%), which also had the highest proportion of graduates pursuing further education. \n \n7.  During the focus group discussions and interviews in the preparation of this Project, \nemployers  in  ready-made  garments  and  textiles,  light  engineering,  and  construction  said \nworkers with the required skills were not readily available in the market. The shortage is keenly \nfelt  particularly  in  construction  and  light  engineering  industries, as  many  of  their  skilled \nworkers have sought employment out of the country. Training for their replacements takes time \nand is costly. In the case of ready-made garments, the shortage is caused mainly by sustained \nhigh growth in product demand, requiring rapid expansion of production capacity. Because the \nwork is labor-intensive, this entails hiring a large number of workers within a short time, which \noften results in poaching workers from other garment firms.  \nB.   Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n8.  Need to Improve Relevance. A major weakness of the current TVET system is its lack \nof linkage, and therefore relevance, to the labor market, i.e., the formal industry subsectors, \ninformal  self-employment  subsector,  and  international  employment.  Mismatches  between \noutputs of the TVET system and needs of employers include (i) types of trades or occupations \nwhere programs being offered, (ii) competencies acquired compared with industry requirements \nor  needs  for  self-employment  opportunities,  and  (iii)  practical  experience  opportunities  for \nstudents. The identification of courses is not based on regular and systematic assessment of \nlabor  market  needs.  Even  if  the  curricular  offerings  match  market  needs,  the  competency \nacquired  may  not  match  industry  requirements.  Employers  have  minimal  input  in  setting \ncompetency  standards,  determining  the  curriculum,  developing  the  testing  and  certification \nsystem, and managing certain training institutions, among others. There is wide scope for \nengaging industries in the TVET system, which has been barely tapped. During the consultation \nworkshop and interviews to prepare the Project, industry leaders expressed willingness to \ncooperate with TVET system authorities. The international labor market is large but highly \ncompetitive.  About  half  of  the  current  deployment  of  Bangladeshi  workers  is  made  up  of \nunskilled laborers. An effective TVET system can increase the proportion of semiskilled and \nskilled  workers  by  using  industry-recognized  and  internationally  benchmarked  competency \nstandards and training systems. TVET can be made more relevant to the informal sector, too, \nby such activities as upgrading skills in certain occupations. A number of NGOs have training \nprograms catering to the informal rural subsector that are achieving high placement rates.  \n9.  Need  to  Improve  Access.  The  existing  formal  TVET  system  provides  limited \nopportunities to target beneficiaries of the NPRS\u2014the underprivileged who do not complete \n ", "  3\nclass 8. Its main clientele are young adolescent males who complete class 8, can afford to stay \nmore  years  in  school,  and  have  strong  white-collar  job  aspirations.  The  minimum  entry \nrequirement to the lowest formal qualifications, basic skill standard certificate (national skills \nstandard-basic) and national skill certificate III (national skills standard III), which is class 8, \nautomatically excludes the large majority who do not achieve it. Promoting female enrolment in \nnontraditional trades is also needed. Until very recently, the lack of formal recognition by the \nBangladesh Technical Education Board (BTEB) of successful NGO- and industry-delivered \nshort  programs  inhibited  their  expansion.  Good  quality  competency-based  training  (CBT) \nmodular courses offer the best vehicle for the TVET system to reach out to the poor. Short \ncourses would be more affordable for trainees than the 2-year SSC (Voc) programs. Opening \nup TVET to the older poor by offering short CBT courses that do not necessarily require class 8 \nfor enrolment will increase TVET output, improve utilization of facilities, reduce unit costs, and \nmake the system more relevant.  \n10.  Need to Improve Quality and Capacity. The pass rate of students in the terminal \nexternal examination, conducted by BTEB, to a large extent reflects the quality of education and \ntraining. One of the major constraints to effective TVET delivery is the lack of trained teachers. \nThe majority of TVET teachers have little pedagogical training, including in CBT delivery; lack \npractical skills; and have little or no industry experience. TVET teachers are interested in \nobtaining in-service training, and BTEB is considering pedagogical and technological training of \nTVET teachers as a requirement for the registration of private TVET institutions. The country \nneeds  a  TVET  teacher  training  system  that  will  provide  preservice  training  and,  more \nimportantly, will quickly and effectively provide teacher upgrading and introduce new curricula \nand teaching methodologies. The current TVET teacher training capacity in the country is \nlimited. The two public TVET teachers\u2019 training institutions, i.e., Technical Teachers Training \nCollege (TTTC) in Dhaka for diploma and degree programs and Vocational Teachers Training \nInstitute (VTTI) in Bogra for diploma and certificate programs, presently serve only the needs of \nMinistry of Education (MOE) TVET institutions. Their facilities need upgrading and they need to \nsupport non-MOE TVET institutions, including government, nongovernment, and private.  \n11.  The lack of trained teachers is compounded by the fact that the majority of private and \nsome government TVET institutions have poorly equipped workshops and laboratories, lack \nteaching and training materials, and have inadequate classrooms and libraries. Consequently, \nthe practical component of the curriculum is not effectively taught. The formal TVET system has \nminimal  capacity  to  meet  the  needs  of  the  labor  market.  Some  TVET  institutions  require \nsubstantial capital investments to increase their capacity to deliver short CBT programs.  \n12.  Lessons. Lessons from activities in skills training supported by the Asian Development \nBank (ADB)4 and other development partners were considered in the project design. The \nProject will actively involve representatives of industries, employers, and NGOs in identifying \noccupational areas that are in demand, in developing competencies for the market-demanded \noccupational areas; and work with BTEB to develop the curricula and learning materials. Skills \ntraining  curricula  will  be  competency-based  and  adapt  internationally  and  locally  available \nmaterials, as appropriate. Since many skills are common internationally, CBT materials are \nreadily available, and model programs in the country have excellent CBT material, a policy of \n\u201cacquire, validate, adopt, adapt the best\u201d is recommended for most curricula. The proposed \nProject pilots the use of a pool of funds for training delivery. The use of training funds can \nencourage flexible reallocation of training resources to high-priority economic activities and \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 1999.

The Project\u2019s training programs \nwill be based on the requirements of the Project\u2019s focus industries. In the communities, the \nGovernment will work with NGOs to assess training needs. After conducting some training \nprograms and before project completion, tracer studies of the trainees will be commissioned. \nThe Project will strengthen the capacity of Directorate of Technical Education (DTE) and project \nimplementation unit (PIU) personnel to analyze labor market demand. Appendix 3 discusses \nlessons applied to the project design. \n13.  Aid  Coordination.  The  development  assistance  community  interested  in  skills \ndevelopment in Bangladesh has established a donor coordinating committee;5 senior MOE \nofficers attend the committee meetings. Appendix 4 describes current support to government \nTVET-related projects. In defining the project components, due consideration was given to the \nplanned  activities  of  the  development  partners  in  the  subsector,  specifically  the  European \nCommission project being implemented by the International Labour Organization. This project \ninvolves  mostly  policy  reform:  (i)  unified  policy  and  governance  framework,  (ii)  national \nqualifications framework, (iii) TVET qualifications framework, (iv) TVET teacher qualifications \nframework,  (v)  registration  and  accreditation  system,  (vi)  testing  and  certification  system,  \n(vii) internal quality assurance system for regulatory bodies, and (viii) apprenticeship system. \nThe European Commission and International Labour Organization (EC\u2013ILO) project and the \nproposed ADB Project are the first large assistance to TVET in Bangladesh in over a decade.\n14.  ADB  Country  Strategy.  ADB  is  a  long-time  partner  of  the  Government  in  human \nresource development. The ADB country strategy for the education sector and TVET for 2006\u2013\n2010 focuses on providing assistance to children and youth who are in school or have left \nschool (Appendix 4). ADB is providing assistance to increase access and improve the quality of \nprimary and secondary education. For those who have left formal education, ADB is providing \nassistance for postliteracy and continuing education activities. The proposed Project will be \nADB\u2019s first assistance to the country\u2019s TVET subsector and is envisioned to be the beginning of \na long-term engagement in it. The proposed Project responds to the country\u2019s immediate needs \nas expressed in the NPRS and complements ADB assistance to general education. It aims to \nimprove  the  marketable  skills  of  school  leavers  by  improving  the  flexibility  and  market-\nresponsiveness of skills training, and by addressing the skills requirements of the informal \nsector. These will facilitate income generation through market employment or self-employment.  \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n15.  The Project\u2019s impact will be increased wage- and self-employment of graduates of skills \ntraining, locally and internationally. The Project supports the Government\u2019s NPRS to reduce \npoverty  and  promote  economic  growth  by  providing  market-relevant  skills  training  to  more \nBangladeshis,  including  the  poor  and  disadvantaged.  The  Project\u2019s  envisioned  outcome  is \nstrengthened capacity of the TVET system to provide market-responsive, short-term, relevant \nskills training to more Bangladeshis, including those who have not completed class 8. The \nProject will be implemented throughout the country.  \n                                                 \n5  The committee members include ADB, Australian Agency for International Development, Canadian International \nDevelopment Agency, Department for International Development, European Commission, Deutsche Gesellschaft \nf\u00fcr  Technische  Zusammenarbeit,  International  Labour  Organization,  Islamic  Development  Bank,  Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency, Japan Overseas Cooperation Volunteers, Korea International Cooperation \nAgency, Swiss Agency for Development Cooperation, United States Agency for International Development, and \nWorld Bank.\n ", "  5\nB.  Outputs \n16.  The  Project  adopts  a  market-responsive  approach  and  will  have  four  outputs:  (i) \nenhanced relevance and access of TVET programs; (ii) improved capacity for good quality \nTVET delivery; (iii) relevant skills training, including to the poor, women, and disadvantaged \ngroups;  and  (iv)  project  management.  The  focus  will  be  on  assisting  and  improving  the \ndevelopment and delivery of short skills training programs that will not necessarily require class \n8 completion or admission into the SSC (Voc) program.  \n \n1.   Enhanced Relevance and Access of TVET Programs  \n17.  This  component  aims  to  enhance  the  relevance  of  training  programs  by  improving \nlinkages to the labor market, and to increase access by developing short CBT programs. The \nProject will pilot the development of a partnership mechanism with three industries: ready-made \ngarments and textiles, light engineering, and construction. Their selection is based on their \nrelative importance to the economy in terms of employment generation, contribution to the \nnational  output,  future  growth  prospects,  availability  of  a  formal  industry  association,  and \ninterest  in  workforce  training.  The  Government  will  work  with  representatives  of  the  three \nindustries and the informal sector (Appendix 5) to determine their specific skills training needs. \nThe  outputs  are  (i)  partnerships  with  industry  established;  (ii)  competency  and  training \nstandards developed; (iii) curricula, teacher guides, learning materials and assessment tools \ndeveloped; and (iv) capacity in external competency assessment developed. \n18.  Partnerships with Industry Established. The Project will support establishment and \noperation of a sector working committee (SWC) in each of the three major industries and the \ninformal sector. Each industry SWC will comprise 8\u201312 technically knowledgeable experts from \nthe industry\u2019s largest member associations. The informal sector SWC will comprise experts from \nthe  largest and  most  successful  NGOs  delivering  skills  training  in  Bangladesh. To  ensure \ncoordination and provide support to the SWCs, a forum of skill development partners will be \nestablished comprising heads of the four SWCs, heads of the largest industry associations in \nthe three focus industries, and the head of the lead NGO in the informal sector SWC. The forum \nwill interact with the BTEB chairperson and members, and other TVET stakeholders. SWC \nmembers  will  benefit  from  regional  and  national  capacity  building  activities  in  needs \nassessments, competency standards development, and public-private partnerships, including \non international experiences for relevant government officials and industry representatives.  \n19.  Competency and Training Standards Developed. Each SWC will identify 10 priority \noccupations (40 in total)6 for the development and dissemination of competency and training \nstandards. Depending on the demand within the 40 priority occupations, the Project will support \nthe development of about 100 competency standards by SWCs, most likely for basic trade and \nnational  skills  standard  III.  The  standards7  will  be  approved  by  their  respective  industry \nstakeholders and endorsed to BTEB for its approval. For the approved competency standards, \nthe SWCs, in coordination with BTEB\u2019s curriculum development committees, will specify the \ntraining standards necessary to attain the competencies. The training standards will include \nspecifications for training duration, number and qualifications of instructors, teaching materials, \nand assessment method.  \n \n                                                 \n6  Some of the likely occupational areas are (i) in ready-made garments, sewing machine operation, pattern-making \nand cutting, and weaving and knitting machines operation; (ii) in light engineering, computer numerical control  \n(CNC) machine operation, machine tools operation and tools and die making; and (iii) in construction, plumbing, \nwelding, masonry, carpentry, and heavy equipment. \n7  Foreign competency standards can be adapted, validated, and adopted for Bangladesh. \n ", "6 \n20.  Curricula, Teacher Guides, Learning Materials and Assessment Tools Developed. \nWith support of the Project, BTEB, in coordination with the SWCs, will develop the related CBT \ncurricula, teacher guides, learning materials and assessment tools for the approved competency \nstandards. Course curricula to be developed through the Project8 will include (i) about 20 short \npost-SSC (Voc) enhancement courses to remedy deficiencies in the skills component of the \nSSC(Voc), and target school leavers seeking immediate vocational employment; (ii) about 10 \nindustry-specific courses at different levels; (iii) about 40 short, modular CBT courses based on \nthe approved competency standards; and (iv) about 20 existing effective short courses provided \nby  NGOs  that  will  be  transformed  using  the  CBT  format.  These  training  courses  will  not \nnecessarily require class 8 as an admission requirement.  \n21.  Four curriculum development committees, one counterpart for each SWC and chaired by \na  senior  BTEB  staff,  will  be  organized  under  BTEB\u2019s  Curriculum  Development  Wing.  To \nsupplement the limited number of regular BTEB staff available for the committees, the Project \nwill support recruitment of national experts, including from universities, colleges, and training \ninstitutes. The Project will support additional BTEB curriculum development specialists, support \nstaff, and national experts; office equipment and software; and local and international staff \ntraining in developing CBT curricula, learning materials, and assessment tools. Where deemed \nnecessary, the Project will support up to two people for about six official bilateral negotiation \ntrips  to  negotiate  for  the  acceptance  of  Bangladesh\u2019s  skill  certificates  and  competency \nstandards by major international destinations of Bangladesh workers.  \n22.  Capacity for External Competency Assessment Developed. The Project will support \nimplementation  of  an  external  skills  assessment  and  certification  system  for  individuals \ninterested in being assessed and certified. The EC\u2013ILO project will develop this system, which \nwill include the recognition of prior learning. The Project will initially support the training of about \n200 competency assessors,9 nominated from industry associations and BTEB, in trade areas \nwhere the SWCs develop competency standards. The international and national consultants on \nstandards  development  and  curriculum  development  will  develop  and  conduct  the  training \nprogram for assessors. An assessment guideline and procedure manual will be developed to \nensure uniform and proper observance of the process. BTEB will issue a skills certificate to \nsuccessful  candidates  of  the  competency  assessment,  and  maintain  a  registry  of  certified \ncompetency assessors. To build the capacity of key personnel and stakeholders, international \ncapacity building activities will be undertaken to learn from other countries' external competency \nassessment systems.  \n \n2.   Improved Capacity for Good Quality TVET Delivery \n23.  This  component  aims  to  improve  the  capacity  for  delivering  training  programs  with \nimproved quality by (i) providing in-service training to TVET teachers; (ii) revitalizing two existing \nTVET teacher training institutions; (iii) strengthening the capacity for short CBT programs in \nselected public and private training institutions; and (iv) strengthening the capacity of DTE for \nplanning, research, and social marketing. The Project will pilot assistance to strengthen short \ntraining  programs  in  private  TVET  institutions,  and  to  undertake  training  partnerships  with \nindustry associations in the SWCs.     \n24.  In-Service Training Provided to TVET Teachers. The Project will address the skill and \ntraining needs of current TVET teachers, regardless of the employer, particularly in pedagogy \n                                                 \n8  The Project will support the acquisition of sample curricula, guides, and assessment materials; secretariat; \nmeetings and workshops; capacity strengthening, consultants and resource persons; printing and distribution \ncosts; circulation and information dissemination; validation; and pilot testing. \n9  Some of the assessors may be qualified to assess in more than one occupational area. \n ", "  7\nand CBT. The Project will assess TVET teacher training needs; prepare a TVET teacher training \nplan, including a monitoring and evaluation plan; and develop and provide in-service teacher \ntraining modules.10 About 4,000 TVET teachers will be introduced to CBT, new curricula, and \ninstructional methodology changes including short modular courses; and 2,500 will receive \ntraining to improve their technological skills. Trainers will be employed and trained; related \nteacher training packages will be developed. The EC\u2013ILO project will review and modernize \nteacher college programs (certificate and diploma programs). The Project will complement this \nEC\u2013ILO activity by supporting its pilot delivery in a flexible manner, including through part-time \nprograms, to about 1,000 TVET teachers. To strengthen the technical capacity in TVET teacher \ntraining, local and international training in pedagogy and technological skills will be provided to \nmaster trainers. To coordinate and provide regional support to the training of teachers, the \nProject will support the establishment of eight regional offices. Teacher training support officers \nwill provide follow-up technical advice to trained TVET teachers. Regional office staff will receive \nlocal training in management, office software and procedures, and financial management.  \n25.  Teacher Training Facilities Upgraded. To revitalize and deliver increased in-service \nTVET  teacher  training  to  government  and  nongovernment  TVET  teachers,  the  Project  will \nupgrade  VTTI  and  TTTC  as  central  facilities  and  resources  for  TVET  teachers\u2019  in-service \ntraining programs. The Project will assist DTE in updating and revising the redevelopment plans \n(5-year development plan) for VTTI and TTTC to (i) expand the scope of the institutions, (ii) \ninclude a multiparty advisory board, (iii) increase enrollment through part-time and multimedia \ndelivery modes, (iv) support and emphasize in-service TVET teacher training on an outreach \nbasis and using mass media, (v) encourage excellence, and (vi) serve personnel of ministries \nother than MOE and the private and NGO sectors. The upgrading of VTTI and TTTC will be \ncontingent on ADB approval of the revised 5-year development plans, which will include specific \nperformance targets. Each facility will be the center for trainers of master teacher-trainers, have \na curricula modernization cell dedicated to adapting/developing new training techniques and \nmultimedia materials, and undertake impact assessment studies of its training programs. The \nProject  will  provide  for  civil  works,  equipment,  furniture,  books  and  journals,  learning  and \ntraining  materials  (including  e-learning),  workshops,  conference,  attendance  of  foreign \nworkshops and conferences, local and international staff development, research funds, and \nresource persons. Local training in institutional management, training needs assessment, and \npublic\u2013private partnerships will be provided to administrators and senior officials. To learn about \nthe practices and experiences of similar institutions abroad, an international study tour of such \ninstitutions will be conducted.   \n26.  Training  Providers  Strengthened.  With  a  view  to  supporting  the  NPRS  goal  of \nexpanding  skill  development  to  more  Bangladeshis,  the  Project  will  strengthen  institutional \ncapacity, on a training program basis, of public and private TVET providers to deliver short CBT \ncourses  developed  under  the  Project.  The  Project11  will  assist  about  60  public  training \ninstitutions,12 15 private training institutions, and 10 NGO-managed training centers. The TVET \ninstitutions will be competitively selected. Shortlisting will be based on a set of criteria to be \napproved by the project steering committee (PSC) and ADB (see para. 42). Possible criteria \ninclude proximity to a labor market, enrolment, pass rates, employment rates, facilities, and \n                                                 \n10  The Project will provide consultancy services, learning and training materials (including e-learning), multimedia \nmaterials and training packages, cost of delivering training, workshops and conferences, newsletters, resource \npeople, and baseline and evaluation studies in TVET teacher training. \n11  The Project allocates $15.8 million for this purpose. The allocated resources are also called the \u201ccompetitive \nprogram development fund.\u201d \n12 The distribution is expected to be as follows: 24 technical schools and colleges, 14 polytechnics/monotechnics (2 of \nwhich will be polytechnics for women), 10 technical training centers, 2 training institutions from the Ministry of \nTextiles, and 10 training institutions/centers from other ministries. \n ", "8 \nindustry  linkage\u2014features  that  contribute  to  delivering  good  quality  CBT  courses.  The \nshortlisted TVET institutions will apply for funding by preparing program improvement plans. \nThe plans will be evaluated by a TVET providers\u2019 proposal evaluation committee, comprising \nrepresentatives of the Project, Bureau of Manpower, Employment and Training (BMET), another \ngovernment  agency,  and  state  corporations;  the  services  of  an  expert  committee  may  be \nemployed if necessary. The evaluation criteria may include alignment of the proposed programs \nwith  the  priority  occupations,  reasonableness  of  the  output  and  outcome  targets, \ninstitutionalization  of  an  industry  advisory  committee,  and  endorsement  of  the  program \nimprovement plans by the industry advisory committee. Successful public, private, and NGO \ninstitutions  will  receive  project  resources  to  finance  the  requirements  indicated  in  their \nrespective program improvement plans, including workshops/laboratories, offices, and toilets; \ntraining equipment and furniture; books, learning materials, and training supplies; and staff \ndevelopment. The Project will provide the successful TVET institutions with additional resources \nto deliver short CBT courses to about 36,000 trainees. Allowances may be provided to trainees \nas appropriate (Appendix 6 and Supplementary Appendix A provide additional information on \nthe flow of funds).  \n27.  Additionally,  the  Project  will  assist  the  focus  industries  by  supporting  about  six \npartnerships  between  the  industry  associations  in  the  SWCs  and  existing  public  TVET \ninstitutions. This can include strengthening industry training programs in partnership with TVET \ninstitutions  and  establishing  new  partnerships  as  necessary,  including  management  of \ngovernment TVET institutions by industry associations on a pilot basis. The items eligible for \nproject support will be the same as for the other TVET institutions. The PIU will facilitate the \npartnerships based on the training needs identified by the industry associations and suitable \nfacilities of an existing training institution, among other considerations.  \n28.  Where  project  resources  are  still  available,  another  set  of  training  institutions  and \npartnerships may be strengthened. This would follow the review of the criteria and procedures; if \nrefined, these would be submitted for PSC and ADB approval.  \n29.  To support public training institutions with implementation of their program improvement \nplans,  the  Project  will  support  policy  development  to  increase  their  financial  authority  and \nadministrative autonomy. In addition, the Project will provide for the repair and renovations of all \nDTE training institutions that do not qualify for training program strengthening. This will finance \nminor equipment repairs and maintenance, roof repairs, wall repairs, and cleaning and painting. \nLocal training and workshops will be provided to senior administrators of government training \ninstitutions in school management, training needs assessment, and linking with industry.   \n30.  DTE  Capacity  for  Planning,  Research,  and  Social  Marketing  Strengthened. To \nsupport the identification of occupations needed by the three industries and the informal sector, \nthe Project will support the establishment of a research and development cell in DTE. Project \nsupport will include provision of personnel costs, office furniture and equipment, software, staff \ndevelopment, and costs associated with printing and disseminating reports of DTE and the \nresearch  and  development  cell.  The  Project  will  conduct  a  study  to  develop  a  10-year \ndevelopment  plan  with  costs  for  the  TVET  subsector  of  Bangladesh.  This  will  incorporate \npolicies, systems, and procedures adopted, including relevant recommendations of the EC\u2013ILO \nproject. The study will include capacity building of relevant planning and research cell personnel \nthrough on-the-job training. The Project will support contracted baseline, tracer and evaluation \nstudies. Data to be collected will be from teacher training and skills training beneficiaries of the \nProject, and a sample of nonbeneficiaries. Research funds will be available for other studies to \nbe identified and undertaken as necessary by DTE, BMET and BTEB, with approval from ADB.  \n ", "  9\n31.  A social marketing plan will be prepared and implemented to disseminate more TVET \ninformation and raise the profile of TVET among the general population, particularly potential \ntrainees and their parents, industry, and employers.13 To gauge the impact of social marketing \nactivities, a perception survey will be conducted before the end of project implementation. To \nfacilitate TVET administration and project implementation, the Project will provide for office \nspace  and  civil  works,  including  the  one-floor  vertical  extension  of  the  DTE  building  to \naccommodate the PIU.  \n3.   Relevant Skills Training Delivered  \n32.  This component aims to support the delivery of skills training programs needed by the \nlabor market, particularly in the three focus industries and in poor communities.  \n33.  Market-Responsive Skills Training Delivered. The Project will support14 the provision \nof  quick-response  and  market-driven  short-term  skills  training  to  about  25,000  trainees, \nparticularly in ready-made garments and textiles, light engineering, and construction; and the \ninformal sector. The Project will support the training of unemployed and underemployed school \nleavers, women, and adults, including those from poor communities (about 7,200 trainees), in \ncommunity training workshops to be established by the Project (see para. 35). The support will \ncover  (i)  fees  or  salaries  of  teachers  and  support  staff  (direct  or  subcontracted);  (ii) \nconsumables and supplies linked to training such as materials, video/audio tapes, and software; \n(iii) travel and accommodation directly related to training program delivery; (iv) allowances of \ntrainees, as appropriate, which will be part of the provider\u2019s proposal; (v) operating costs related \nto training, such as utilities, rental of equipment, and training venues; and (vi) overhead/profit \n(Appendix 7 and Supplementary Appendix B provide more information on the flow of funds.) \nTraining  courses  will  include  CBT,  following  the  skills  standards  and  curricula  developed \nthrough the Project, and will not necessarily require class 8 completion for admission. As \nappropriate, training in poor communities does not have to be CBT training, and can include \nentrepreneurship and/or link trainees to NGOs with financial assistance activities. \n34.  The PIU will identify immediate training needs in the three focus industries and the \ninformal  sector,  and  package  these  for  open  tendering  to  providers,  including  those \nstrengthened by the Project. In cooperation with the PIU, BMET will also identify training needs, \nparticularly for the international labor market. The project implementation committee (PIC) will \nprioritize the occupational areas to be supported in this component (see para. 42). Skills training \nwill  be  provided  by  BMET\u2019s  technical  training  centers  (TTCs)  and  other  training  providers \nselected through tendering. BMET will assign its training packages to its TTCs most capable of \ndelivering them, or tender as appropriate. The selection criteria for providers of tendered training \ninclude pass rates in terminal examinations, employment rates of graduates, years of operation, \nenrollment size, number and qualifications of teachers, and facilities. The tender evaluation \ncommittee, with the assistance of an expert committee as necessary, will evaluate the providers\u2019 \nproposals  and  make  their  recommendation  to  the  PIC.  The  PIU  will  be  supported  by  the \nservices of international and national specialists in training financing management design and \ntraining program design and packaging.   \n35.  Skills Training Delivered in Poor Communities. The Project will facilitate the provision \nof short vocational trade courses in poor communities. The Project will establish a multipurpose \ntraining  workshop  in  40  government  educational  institutions  in  poor  communities.  The \n                                                 \n13  This will include advertisements through mass media, preparation and distribution of printed materials, and \nparticipation in community and institutional events. \n14  The Project has allocated $9.2 million for this purpose. The allocated resources are also called the \u201cmarket-\nresponsive training fund.\u201d \n ", "10 \ncommunities will be selected based on criteria to be approved by the PSC and ADB and include \npoverty indicators and population size. DTE regional staff will manage the training workshops, \nwhich will be open to all training providers for use as venues/platforms for short skills training \ncourses  in  their  communities.  The  Project  will  engage  NGOs  to  conduct  training  gap \nassessments,  determine  employment  and  business  opportunities  of  residents,  and  identify \nneeded trades; and in the process build the capacity of DTE regional staff to work with poor \ncommunities. Based on the assessments, the Project will support the introduction and delivery \nof needed vocational trade courses in the workshops through market-responsive skills training \n(see para. 33).   \n4.   Project Management  \n36.  To support project implementation, the Project will finance office space rental and minor \ncivil works while the DTE building is being constructed, office equipment and furniture, vehicles, \nand remuneration of PIU staff. To strengthen the project management capacity of PIU, DTE, \nand  MOE  staff,  training  will  be  provided,  particularly  on  procurement,  disbursement,  and \nfinancial administration. In implementing activities to strengthen programs of selected TVET \ninstitutions and to support delivery of market-responsive skills training, the PIU will be assisted \nby  an  international  training  financing  management  design  specialist  and  international  and \nnational training program design and packaging specialists. A national financial management \nspecialist  will  strengthen  the  PIU\u2019s  financial  administration  capacity.  To  support  project \nimplementation in BMET, a BMET implementation cell will be established and its staff supported \nby the Project. The Project will also provide external independent financial and performance \nassessments. \nC.  Special Features \n37.  Public\u2013Private Sector Partnership. Until now, TVET training providers and employers \nhave conducted training activities independently, except for a few partnerships initiated by some \nNGOs and industry groups. The Project will pilot a partnership structure and processes to bring \npublic authorities, training providers, employers, and NGOs together. The approach is market-\nresponsive rather than supply-driven. Employer representatives will identify occupations where \ntraining gaps exist and specify the required skills standards. The Project will provide resources \nfor skills training development and addressing training gaps. Resources will be available for \nestablishing or strengthening training partnerships between industry associations and public \nTVET institutions.  \n38.  Focus on Short CBT Courses. The Project will focus on the development and rollout of \nshort,  modular  training  programs  based  on  competency  standards  set  by  industry.  The \nGovernment will certify the training programs to increase their recognition by employers. The \nshort courses will diversify the system\u2019s clientele, opening up opportunities for those unable to \ncomplete class 8, including the poor, women, and disadvantaged groups.   \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n39.  The project investment cost is estimated at $66.7 million, including taxes and duties of \n$7.8 million (Table 1). Detailed cost estimates are in appendixes 8, 9, and 10. \nE.  Financing Plan \n40.  The Government has requested a loan of $50.0 million in various currencies equivalent \nto Special Drawing Rights (SDR) 30,741,000 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help \nfinance the Project. The loan will have a 32-year term including a grace period of 8 years, with \nan interest charge of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. \n ", " 11\nThe ADB loan will finance costs relating to civil works; procurement of vehicles; equipment; \nlearning resources; training; consulting services; research and administration; financial charges \nduring implementation; and a portion of project operation, maintenance, and staff salaries; but \nnot taxes and duties.

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n41.  MOE will be the Executing Agency for the Project. DTE will be the Implementing Agency, \nand have overall responsibility to plan, organize, manage, and monitor project implementation, \nas  well  as  monitor  progress  achieved.  The  PIU  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day  project \nimplementation and overall coordination among all stakeholders. It will be headed by a full-time \nproject director who will be at the level of joint secretary. MOE will inform ADB prior to any \nchange of the project director. A full-time additional project director, to be seconded from senior \nDTE staff, will be the overall deputy to the project director. Appendix 11 presents the indicative \nPIU structure.   \n42.  The PSC15 will be formed within 1 month of loan effectiveness and chaired by the MOE \n                                                 \n15  PSC membership will comprise a representative of the Economic Relations Division; the Chief (Planning), MOE; \nrepresentatives of the Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division, and of the Planning Commission; \nDirector General, DTE; Director General, BMET; Chairman, BTEB; representatives from the Expatriates\u2019 Welfare \nand Overseas Employment Ministry, the Labour and Employment Ministry, and the Youth and Sports Ministry; and \nrepresentatives of the Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Bangladesh Garments Manufacturer's and \nExporter's Association, Bangladesh Textile Mills Association, Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters \nAssociation,  Bangladesh  Association  of  Construction  Industry,  Bangladesh  Engineering  Industries\u2019  Owners \nAssociation, and Mirpur Agricultural Workshop and Training School. \n ", "12 \nsecretary. The project director will be the member-secretary. Since the PSC is expected to \naddress long-term TVET policy issues, its membership will be flexible. Appropriate people and \nspecialists  will  be  invited  as  required.  The  PSC  will  be  responsible  for  detailed  policy \nformulation, provide guidance and advice to the Project, and approve the Project\u2019s annual work \nplan. It will approve the selection criteria for (i) institutions eligible for program strengthening \nunder  the Project,  (ii)  market-responsive  training  proposals  eligible for  project support,  (iii) \ntraining providers of the market-responsive skills training programs to be tendered, and (iv) the \n40 educational institutions that will receive a multipurpose training workshop. Since it is a large \ncommittee, the PSC will meet quarterly. A PIC (see para. 34), chaired by the director general, \nDTE, will be established to oversee day-to-day implementation of the Project. Among others, \nthe PIC16 will approve the priority occupations for which training programs are to be developed \nand delivered under the Project. To facilitate project implementation and coordination across \nministries  and  agencies,  MOE  will  sign  memoranda  of  understanding/cooperation  with  the \nrelevant stakeholders as necessary. DTE and the PIU will ensure that the Project is closely \naligned with the EC\u2013ILO project. \n43.  BMET will implement project activities that will benefit BMET institutions according to \napplicable operations manuals and training plans. These include (i) strengthening the short \nskills training programs of 10 TTCs, (ii) implementing market-responsive skills training in TTCs, \nand  (iii)  providing  in-service  TVET  teacher  training  for  about  400  BMET  TVET  teachers \naccording to the TVET teacher training plan. As appropriate, the PIU can procure equipment for \nBMET, particularly if internationally procured and/or to take advantage of volume discounts. All \nBMET project activities will be facilitated by the BMET implementation cell; it will be headed by a \ndeputy project director reporting to the project director and the additional project director, and \nwill have support staff.  \n44.  Civil works activities of government institutions will be administered by the appropriate \ngovernment civil works agency (Engineering Education Department for MOE and Public Works \nDepartment for BMET); where implementation delays are experienced, alternate arrangements \nmay be considered in consultation with ADB.     \n2.  Implementation Period \n45.  The Project will be implemented over 5 years, from June 2008 to May 2013.  The \nindicative implementation schedule is in Appendix 12. \n3.  Procurement \n46.  Goods, Services, and Civil Works. ADB-financed goods, services, and civil works will \nbe procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). The indicative procurement plan for the Project is in Appendix 13. Goods, services, and \ncivil works to be acquired for TVET institutions will be packaged as appropriate. Each works \ncontract estimated to cost more than the equivalent of $1 million will be awarded on the basis of \ninternational  competitive  bidding,  and  works  contracts  estimated  to  cost  the  equivalent  of  \n$1 million or less will be awarded on the basis of national competitive bidding (NCB) procedures \nacceptable to ADB. Each contract for goods, and equipment and/or materials greater than  \n$1 million will be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding procedures, and \nthose for $1 million or less will follow NCB procedures acceptable to ADB. NCB procedures \napplicable to the Project are specified in the Government\u2019s Public Procurement Act 2006. \nBefore  commencement  of  NCB  procurement,  ADB  and  the  Government  will  review  the \n                                                 \n16  PIC membership will comprise representatives from the Planning Commission, the Implementation Monitoring and \nEvaluation Division, MOE, BTEB\u2019s CDC, the NGO SWC, industry SWCs; and director, training, BMET. \n ", " 13\nGovernment\u2019s procurement procedures to ensure consistency with ADB requirements. Any \nnecessary modifications or clarifications to Government procedures will be documented in the \nprocurement plan. NCB packages valued at more than $100,000 each will be subject to prior \nreview  by  ADB.  Draft  documents  for  NCB  of  packages  valued  at  between  $50,000  and \n$100,000 will be reviewed by ADB before the first package is tendered. The PIU will ensure that \nall procurement complies with the applicable procedures. Goods, services, and civil works of \nbeneficiary TVET institutions will be packaged as appropriate. \n47.  Various training providers will provide the short-term skills training. Skills training to be \nconducted  as  part  of  the  program-strengthening  assistance  to  TVET  institutions  will  be \nconducted by the beneficiary institutions. Market-responsive skills training will be delivered \nthrough open tender and through BMET\u2019s TTCs. Training packages to be tendered will be \ncontracted as services; technical evaluation criteria will comprise 80% of the total score.  \n48.  Staff  Development  and  Training.  The  Project  will  provide  international  and  local \ntraining to qualified recipients (Appendix 14), including attendance in appropriate international \nconferences and workshops. Selection of candidates will follow the Government\u2019s policy and \nimplementing guidelines for international and local training. ADB concurrence of candidates for \ninternational  staff  development  will  be  obtained  prior  to  final  selection  by  the  competent \nauthority. ADB will be provided with a list of (i) nominated candidates, (ii) their qualifications, (iii) \njustification  and  relevance  of  training,  and  (iv)  detailed  cost  of  proposed  training.  Only \ncandidates whose work is directly related to the objectives of the regional and international \ntraining and study tours will be considered. Training recipients must sign a bonding arrangement \nrequiring  them  to  remain  in  their  institutions  for  a  minimum  period,  in  accordance  with \nGovernment procedures. VTTI and TTTC will provide in-service TVET teacher training activities. \nAs required, other appropriate teacher training institutions and providers of hands-on technology \ntraining and pedagogy will be contracted to provide TVET teacher training according to the \nTVET teacher training plan. They will use training materials developed through the Project, \namong others.  \n4.  Consulting Services \n49.  The selection and engagement of consultants to be financed under the Project will be in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime) and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of national consultants. \nThe consultants\u2019 services will comprise about 97 person-months from international consultants \nand  260  person-months  from  national  consultants  (Appendix  13,  Table  A13.4,  and \nSupplementary  Appendix  C).  A  team  of  consultants  will  provide  services  in  a  range  of \nspecializations, with estimated international inputs of about 85 person-months and national \ninputs of about 224 person-months. The team will be engaged through a firm using the quality- \nand cost-based selection method; the quality-cost ratio will be 80:20. A full technical proposal \nwill be used for recruitment. The consulting team, led by the team leader, will arrange and \nimplement the Project\u2019s international staff training program, for which a separate management \nfee will be provided. Additional national consultants will be separately engaged to provide \nservices for external independent performance and financial assessments, research studies, \nand monitoring and evaluation activities. \n50.  Taking into account the services required and consultants to be recruited, and the \nnecessity to reduce project implementation start-up delays, the Government has requested that \nADB, on behalf of the Government, undertake the shortlisting, evaluation, and ranking of the \nlead firms or organizations and their proposals. Contract negotiations, approval and signing of \ncontracts will remain the Government\u2019s responsibility, with ADB assistance as may be required. \n ", "14 \n51.  Advance  Contracting.  As  the  Project  needs  to  operate  immediately  after  loan \neffectiveness, MOE has requested advance action for procurement of civil works, goods, and \nmaterials  and/or  equipment  to  expedite  project  implementation,  as  well  as  for  shortlisting \nconsulting firms. Advance action will apply only until the evaluation of bids; contracts will be \nawarded and agreements signed only after loan effectiveness. ADB\u2019s concurrence on advance \nactions does not commit ADB to finance the Project.  \n5.  Anticorruption Policy \n52.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. To support these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations \nand the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in \nconnection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and \nexamine the records and accounts of the Executing Agency and all contractors, suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project.  \n53.  Good  governance  and anticorruption  measures  for  the  Project  are  in  Appendix 15. \nDuring implementation, ADB will monitor project activities frequently and regularly, including the \nselection of training and educational institutions to be assisted by the Project and the selection \nof training providers. The PIU will have a project website that will provide procurement notices, \nprocurement status, progress updates of training institutions receiving assistance, and progress \nof funded training programs. The PIU will have a monitoring and evaluation unit that will monitor \ncivil works and skills training activities. Consultants in financial management, procurement, and \ntraining  financing  management  design  will  provide  strengthening  for  transparency  and \ngovernance. External independent assessments will be conducted for finance and performance.   \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n54.  MOE  will  be  responsible  for  preparing  disbursement  projections,  and  requesting \nbudgetary allocations for counterpart funds. To ensure the timely release of loan funds, an \nimprest account will be established in Bangladesh Bank. The initial deposit will be equivalent to \nno more than 6 months of projected disbursements, or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is \nless. The imprest account will be established, managed, and liquidated in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook, and detailed arrangements agreed to by the Government \nand ADB. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditure (SOE) procedures may be used to reimburse eligible \nexpenditures, as well as to liquidate advances made into the imprest account, in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s loan disbursement guidelines. Any payment to be reimbursed or liquidated under the \nSOE procedures will not exceed the equivalent of $50,000. MOE will coordinate the timely \nrelease of funds. Auditors acceptable to ADB will audit the use of the imprest account and SOE \nprocedures. A separate audit opinion will be included in the annual audit report. The PIU will \nprovide an advance to a separate BMET account for an amount equal to 6 months of their \nplanned work based on a 6-month work plan. The BMET account will be subject to the same \naudit and financial management requirements as the PIU account.  \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n55.  The Government, acting through MOE, will maintain records and accounts adequate to \nidentify goods and services financed from the loan proceeds. MOE will maintain separate \nrecords and accounts for the Project, and ensure that accounts and financial statements are \naudited annually by independent external auditors acceptable to ADB. The auditor\u2019s report and \n ", " 15\ncopies of the certified accounts and related financial statements, including the auditor\u2019s opinion \non the use of loan proceeds, procurement, compliance with loan covenants, and use of the \nimprest account and the BMET account under ADB\u2019s SOE procedures, will be submitted to ADB \nin English not later than 6 months after the end of the Government\u2019s fiscal year. \n56.  The PIU will compile and consolidate monthly reports, and prepare a quarterly progress \nreport for submission to ADB within 20 days after each quarter. The report will include (i) actual \nachievements against targets; (ii) major problems and issues encountered in the course of \nimplementation, and actions taken or proposed to resolve them; (iii) status of compliance with \nloan covenants; and (iv) planned activities for the succeeding quarter including contract awards \nand  disbursement  projection.  Within  3  months  after  the  end  of  implementation,  MOE  will \nprepare and submit to ADB a project completion report on execution of the Project, including \ncosts, compliance with loan covenants, key outputs, outcomes and impacts, and lessons.  \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n57.  To ensure efficient project implementation, the Government will prepare and provide \nADB with the operational plan for the Project for the next fiscal year, at least 30 days before the \nstart of the next fiscal year. The operational plan will include (i) project activities with cost \nestimates proposed for each component and/or subcomponent with performance targets; (ii) a \nplan for complying with outstanding loan covenants; (iii) a breakdown of financial requirements, \nincluding loan proceeds withdrawal and counterpart funds from the Government; and (iv) details \non how project activities are to be integrated into ongoing programs.  \n58.  DTE and the PIU will establish a comprehensive project performance monitoring and \nevaluation system acceptable to ADB. The Monitoring and Evaluation Unit of the PIU will be \nprimarily responsible for monitoring input, activity, milestone, and output performance indicators \nagainst performance targets; and compliance with guidelines, procedures, contract provisions, \nand budgets to ensure accountability and transparency. Data to be collected about project \nbeneficiaries  will  include  gender,  ethnicity,  and  socioeconomic  or  poverty  indicators.  PIU \nmanagement and staff and consultants will conduct on-site monitoring visits to observe activities \nand get direct feedback from participants, providers, and other interested stakeholders. External \nindependent financial and performance assessments of project implementation will also be \nundertaken. Studies will be conducted during project implementation: baseline study, tracer \nstudies, and end-of-project evaluation study. Conducted during the first 6 months of project \ncommencement, the baseline study will establish baseline data on the status of assisted public \nand private TVET institutions. The tracer and evaluation studies will assess the impacts of the \nintervention on the capacity of assisted institutions, TVET teachers, and skills training recipients. \nData  from  control  groups  will  be  collected.  Study  contracts  will  include  provisions  for \nstrengthening DTE\u2019s research and development cell through participation and mentoring in \nstudy activities. The midterm review of the Project will be supported by a midterm assessment \nstudy.  \n9.  Project Review \n59.  The Government and ADB, and any cofinanciers that may provide joint financing of the \nProject at a later date, will review the Project\u2019s progress jointly at least twice a year. Besides \nthese regular reviews, the Government and ADB will undertake a joint midterm review during \nthe Project\u2019s third year. Among other things, they will (i) review the project scope, design, \nimplementation arrangements, institutional development, and capacity-building processes; (ii) \nreview  changes  in  Government  policies  and  institutional  framework  since  appraisal,  and \nevaluate  their  impact  on  project  implementation  and  sustainability;  (iii)  assess  project \nimplementation  against  appropriate  projections  and  performance  indicators;  (iv)  review \n ", "16 \ncompliance  with  loan  covenants;  (v)  assess  compliance  with  the  gender  action  plan,  the \nindigenous  peoples  development  framework,  and  the  good  governance  and  anticorruption \nmeasures; (vi) identify critical issues, problems, and constraints; and (vii) recommend changes \nin project design or implementation, as needed. The review will give specific attention to (i) \nprogress of cooperation between the SWCs, DTE, BMET and BTEB; (ii) identification of needed \nskills training; and (iii) implementation of activities to provide program strengthening in selected \nTVET institutions and activities to provide market-responsive skills training, including amount of \nassistance, number of institutions assisted, and disbursement rates for program strengthening \nand provision of market-responsive skills training. The number of industries assisted under the \nProject will also be reviewed. The PIU will submit a comprehensive report on each of these \nissues to ADB at least 1 month before the review. In addition, after selection of the first batch of \nTVET  institutions  for  program  strengthening  and  selection  and  tendering  of  the  market-\nresponsive skills training programs, the selection criteria, procedures, processes, and funds flow \nwill be reviewed with a view to refining them and facilitating the application and evaluation \nprocess in a transparent manner. Any changes in the criteria and procedures will be submitted \nfor PSC and ADB approval.  \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits and Impacts \n60.  Institutional and Sectoral. The Project will initiate reform-oriented activities in TVET \nsystem operation with the goal of making it more demand-driven, flexible, and oriented toward \nincreasingly serving the poor and disadvantaged. The pilot model on public\u2013private sector \ncollaboration will establish a linkage between the TVET authorities and training providers and \nthe formal and informal labor markets to minimize the mismatch between supply and demand \nfor labor. The development and use of industry-approved or -recognized competency standards \nwill introduce a new approach to the TVET system that gives more value to actual competencies \nacquired than to traditional qualifications. The revitalization of the two key TVET teacher training \ninstitutions will support an expanded teacher training system that will also serve private and \nnongovernment  training  providers.  In-service  training  of  TVET  teachers  addresses  the \nimmediate need of TVET providers to provide untrained teachers with both pedagogical and \ntechnological skills, which will contribute to improving the quality of skills training delivery.   \n61.  Social. The development of short modular CBT courses will provide greater flexibility in \nterms of duration and required students\u2019 academic qualifications. Offering training programs not \nnecessarily requiring class 8 for enrolment will expand access to the TVET system to those who \ndid not complete this required grade, many of whom are poor. Upgrading the facilities of TVET \ninstitutions will improve the capacity for delivering short, relevant training programs. Training \nworkshops in selected poor communities will make training more accessible to the poor. Thus, \nthe Project will open TVET institutions to a larger number of trainees in short CBT courses, most \nof whom would have been denied access because of the class 8 barrier to entry. As the training \nprograms  will  be  demand-driven  and  based  on  industry-set  or  -recognized  standards, \nopportunities for employment and self-employment of trainees will improve.    \n62.  Economic.  Economic  benefits  of  the  Project  are  derived  mainly  from  (i)  increased \naccess to skills training as a result of developing short, modular CBT courses; training delivery \nsupport; and program strengthening of selected TVET institutions; and (ii) improved relevance \nand quality of skills training through the partnership with employers, industry, and NGOs; and \nthe related revision of curricula and provision of in-service teacher training. The Project will have \nabout 68,200 trainees over the five years of implementation. After completion of their training, \nthe graduates are expected to seek local or international employment or be self-employed. \nThose who will be employed locally will contribute to increased domestic production because of \n ", " 17\ntheir  skills  training  (increased  human  capital)  that  will  be  reflected  in  increased  earnings. \nGraduates  who  will  be  employed  internationally  will  bring  increased  foreign  currency \nremittances into the country. With the combined efforts to increase access to short-term skills \ntraining and improve their relevance and quality, the proportion of trainees employed from the \nProject-supported training programs is expected to improve to 75% in 2015. Teacher training, \nimprovements in the training curricula, and improved training facilities are also expected to \nbenefit students enrolled in the SSC (Voc) and HSC (Voc) programs. Although they are not the \ntarget beneficiaries of the Project, improving the quality of teaching and practical training in \nvocational subjects is expected to improve examination pass rates and employment rates. \nUnder these projections, the economic internal rate of return is estimated at 13.9% in the base-\ncase scenario (Appendix 16). \nB.  Risks and Assumptions \n63.  The partnership model assumes the continued commitment and cooperation of the three \npartner-industry associations and NGOs in the SWC. Thus, the Project will sign memoranda of \nunderstanding and provide strengthening activities to SWC members. The three focus industries \nand NGOs are also eligible for training partnership assistance. Their training requirements will \nbe  supported  through  the  provision  of  market-responsive  skills  training.  In  addition,  the \nconcurrent policy development activities of EC\u2013ILO will reinforce linkages with industry and \ncoordination  of  TVET-related  government  agencies.  The  Project\u2019s  proposed  capacity \ndevelopment in external competency assessment for the recognition of prior learning assumes \nthat the EC\u2013ILO project activity to develop the related policy and system will be at an advanced \nstage by the end of the Project\u2019s second year of implementation. The Project will closely \ncoordinate with the EC\u2013ILO project and, if any delay is experienced in that project, the services \nof the Project\u2019s specialists in TVET policy and competency standards and CBT curriculum, \nmaterials and assessment tools development can help prepare the draft of the relevant policy \nand its supporting system to facilitate the process.  \n64.  The Project aims to provide in-service training to about 4,000 untrained teachers from \npublic and private TVET institutions. However, substitute teachers may not be available while \nthe untrained teachers are on training. This will be addressed by making the training program \nmodular, short, and continuous; and scheduling teacher training when student training programs \nare not in session. The Project\u2019s loan assurances also provide for BTEB certification of the in-\nservice  teacher  training.  EC\u2013ILO  activities  in  TVET  teacher  qualifications  and  teacher \nstrengthening will complement this activity.  \n65.  The  limited  scope  of  activities  in  the  two  key  TVET  teacher  training  institutions \ncontributed to its underutilization. The new approach to include a multiparty advisory board, in-\nservice outreach training, and training for staff from the private and NGO sectors and other \nministries will help increase utilization of TVET facilities. Management training for administrators \nwill facilitate addressing the training needs of non-MOE staff. Complementary inputs from the \nEC\u2013ILO project will support improvements in quality and relevance that should maintain the \ndemand for the preservice and in-service TVET teacher training programs.   \n66.  The pace of providing market-responsive skills training, which involves awarding and \nadministering many training contracts, will depend on the PIU\u2019s implementation capacity. To \nminimize the risk of delays, the Project will provide (i) adequate highly qualified staff, including \nfor contract administration, in the PIU; and (ii) support for the evaluation committees. The PIU \nwill also be supported by international and national specialists in training financing management \ndesign, training program design and packaging, and financial management. \n ", "18 \n67.  Safeguard  Measures. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy and the \ngender action plan are in appendixes 17 and 18. The Project\u2019s environmental aspects were \nreviewed;  no  adverse  impacts  are  anticipated.  The  amount  of  waste  generated  under  the \nProject is expected to be small. Nevertheless, environmental considerations will be incorporated \ninto the project activities to avoid any minor environmental impacts during refurbishment of \ntraining institutions and in the disposal of training waste materials. Waste management plans \nwill  be  formulated  to  protect  human  health  and  the  environment;  and  to  ensure  the  safe \ncollection,  transport,  treatment,  storage,  and  disposal  of  waste.  The  plans  will  highlight \nsegregation  at  source,  recovery  and  use  of  recovered  materials,  and  safe  disposal  in \nappropriately designated landfill sites. The Project will have no negative impacts on indigenous \npeople,  but  will  impact  positively  on  all  qualified  trainee-beneficiaries,  including  indigenous \npeople (Appendix 19). To ensure that training will not hinder the attendance of any member of \nan indigenous group, training venues will be in publicly accessible venues. With no planned land \nacquisition, the Project is unlikely to trigger ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). \nV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \nA.  Specific Assurances  \n68.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government has given the following specific \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n69.  MOE will ensure that all skills and training standards, curricula, and training programs \ndeveloped through the Project will receive BTEB certification. All recipients of skills training \nunder the Project and all TVET teachers who receive in-service teacher training through the \nProject will be granted BTEB certification after complying with necessary assessment standards \nand applicable rules and regulations of BTEB.  \n70.  Within  1  year  of  loan  effectiveness,  BTEB  will  have  issued  an  order  making  the \nregistration and affiliation of training institutions subject to performance-based assessments and \nfull compliance with registration requirements, including employing trained TVET teachers as \nstaff. \n71.  MOE will ensure that, prior to Project completion, every teacher teaching in SSC (Voc) \nprograms and receiving salary subvention will have participated in pedagogical and technical \ntraining.  \n72.  Within six months of loan effectiveness, MOE will submit to the Ministry of Establishment \na proposal for transferring the existing teaching and training posts created in those public \ntraining institutions assisted under the Project from the development budget to the revenue \nbudget.  \n73.  At  least  12  months  before  Project  completion,  MOE  will  submit  to  the  Ministry  of \nEstablishment a proposal for transferring posts of the DTE research and development cell and \nof the regional offices from the development budget to the revenue budget. Equally qualified \nwomen will be given preference.  \n74.  By 30 June 2009, MOE will delegate the authority to recruit part-time TVET teachers for \npublic training institutions, including for short-term skills training, to regional DTE offices. Upon \ncompletion  of  the  EC\u2013ILO  study  on  increased  autonomy  of  training  institutions,  MOE  will \ndelegate  financial  authority  to  all  public  training  institutions,  including  for  hiring  part-time \ninstructors and instructors for short-term training courses.  \n ", " 19\n75.  The Government will ensure that sufficient resources for training supplies and materials; \nand  repair,  operation,  and  maintenance  of  facilities  and  equipment  are  made  available  to \nproject-supported public training institutions throughout and after the project implementation \nperiod.  \n76.  Throughout the project implementation period, the Government will ensure that sufficient \nbudget in its recurrent budget to DTE and BMET.   \n77.  Within 2 months of loan effectiveness, MOE will issue an order to VTTI and TTTC to \nensure  that  they  will  serve  the  teacher  training  needs  of  the  government,  private,  and \nnongovernment sectors.  \n \n78.  MOE will ensure that training workshops provided by the Project to 40 educational \ninstitutions are made available for use as training venues to any training provider.  \n79.  Within 3 months of fielding the financing management design consultant, DTE will have \ncompleted  the  establishment  of  a  project  performance  monitoring  system  for  the  Project, \ncollected baseline data on public and private TVET institutions, including on gender, ethnicity, \nand socio-economic and poverty indicators.  \n80.  DTE will ensure that all project activities will be implemented in accordance with the \nselection criteria agreed upon between ADB and MOE. The criteria and procedures to select \nTVET  institutions  whose  training  programs  will  be  strengthened  under  the  Project,  select  \ntraining providers of market-responsive skills training under the Project, and establish training \nworkshops  in  poor  communities  will  be  approved  by  the  PSC  within  3  months  of  loan \neffectiveness. \n81.  MOE will inform ADB prior to any change of the project director. \n82.  To ensure efficient project implementation, DTE will prepare and provide ADB with the \nnext fiscal year\u2019s operations plan for the Project at least 30 days before the start of the next \nfiscal year. \n83.  DTE will obtain ADB\u2019s concurrence of candidates for overseas training prior to final \nselection  by  the  competent  authority.  For  such  purpose, DTE  will  submit  to  ADB  detailed \ninformation about the candidates\u2019 qualifications, their experience, as well as the relevance and \ndetailed  costs  of  the  proposed  training.  DTE  will  make  all  efforts  to  retain  staff  that  has \nparticipated in international training in their respective institutions, including through bonding \narrangements in line with the Government\u2019s policy and guidelines for international training. \n84.  Within 3 months of loan effectiveness, the PIU will prepare, and DTE and MOE will \napprove, a detailed action plan, with budget allocation for implementing the good governance \nmeasures  set  out  in  Appendix  15  The  progress  of  implementation  will  be  included  in  the \nquarterly reports for the Project and will be made available on the website for the Project. \n85.  The Government will ensure that the Project is implemented in accordance with the \ngender  action  plan  (Appendix  18)  and  the  indigenous  peoples'  development  framework \n(Supplementary Appendix F). \n86.  The Borrower will ensure that all civil works to be carried out under the Project will be \nwithin existing premises and will not entail any land acquisition, resettlement, or land donation \nas defined in ADB's Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995). In the event of unforeseen \nresettlement, the Government will promptly inform ADB thereof and prepare the necessary \nresettlement plan in accordance with ADB's Policy on Involuntary Resettlement. In such case, \n ", "20 \nthe Government will ensure that no civil works contract will be awarded until ADB has reviewed \nthe resettlement plan.  \n87.  The Government will ensure that civil works contractors comply with all applicable labor \nlaws,  do  not  employ  child  labor  for  construction  and  maintenance  activities,  and  do  not \ndifferentiate wages between men and women for work of equal value. \n88.  The Government will ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002), and \nexisting environmental laws and regulations of Bangladesh. In case of discrepancy, ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy will prevail. Each training institution will develop a waste management plan. \n \nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness \n89.  The following conditions will be met by the Government before loan effectiveness: \n(i)  The Development Project pro forma has been approved by Executive Committee \nof the National Economic Council. \n(ii)  The project director and key PIU staff have been appointed. \n \nC.  Condition for Disbursement \n90.  The 5-year development plan of VTTI and TTTC, which will include expanding their \nscope, will be approved by the PSC and ADB before any civil works or equipment procurement \nin this subcomponent can commence. \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n91.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various \ncurrencies  equivalent  to  Special  Drawing  Rights  30,741,000  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of \nBangladesh for the Skills Development Project from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with an \ninterest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter; a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement \npresented to the Board.  \n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n \n14 May 2008 \n ", "  Appendix 1  21 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n    Data   \nDesign    Sources/Reporting  Assumptions \nSummary  Performance Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nIncreased wage and  (cid:120) Proportion of trainees employed from  Labor force surveys  (cid:120) Local economy and \nself-employment of  Project-supported training programs  Training  international labor \nskills training graduates   increased by 50% to 75% in 2015   management  markets continue to \n    information data   grow and create more \nTracer and  employment \nevaluation reports  opportunities for \nBangladesh Bureau  Bangladeshis \nof Educational   \nInformation and \nStatistics data \nOutcome      Assumptions  \nStrengthened TVET  (cid:120) Total enrolment capacity in short-term  Reports of MOE,  (cid:120) Reform of the TVET \ncapacity to provide  skills training in government and  DTE, BTEB, BMET,  system to become more \nmarket-responsive,  Project-supported TVET providers  TTTC, and VTTI  flexible, market-\nshort-term relevant skills  increased by at least 6,000 per year by  Project progress  responsive, and quality-\ntraining   2013   reports  assured continues.  \n  (cid:120) Government vocational and technical  Training  (cid:120) Government \nmanagement \nteachers\u2019 preservice and in-service  commitment to make \ninformation data \ntraining programs serve non- MOE  TVET market-\ntraining providers by the end of the  responsive and work \nproject implementation period  with industries and \n(cid:120) Industry involved in identifying,  NGOs is maintained. \npreparing and/or delivering  training  (cid:120) Government support for \nprograms  increased TVET delivery \n(cid:120) Females comprise at least 25% of  continues. \nskills training recipients under the   \nProject \n1.

The contribution of the technical and vocational education and training (TVET) system to \nthe supply of labor relative to total demand is minimal. However, the Government and the \ndevelopment community recognize the potential of TVET in providing employable skills to those \nwho did not and would not pass through the school system; leave the school system early; and \nneed higher skills even after completing the certificate, diploma, or degree courses. However, to \nachieve the goals of the national poverty reduction strategy, many aspects of TVET need to be \naddressed: relevance, quality, and access, in particular. \nA.   The Technical and Vocational Education Training System \n2.  The TVET system in Bangladesh may be classified into four groups: (i) public, (ii) private \n(commercial), (iii) nongovernment organization (NGO), and, (iv) industry (managed by industry \nassociations and industry-provided on-the-job training). Each of these groups offers a wide \nvariety of formal and nonformal training programs for various types of clientele using different \ntypes of training delivery. As of school year 2004-05, formal TVET was mostly offered by about \n2,728 institutions: 180 or 7% public and 2,548 or 93% private. Of the 17,185 teachers delivering \nTVET courses, 2,939 or 17% were in public institutions and 14,246 were in private institutions. \nOf the 241,336 total enrolment, 20% was in public and 80% in private institutions. Between \nschool years 2001/02 and 2004/05, enrolment rose by about 80%.  \n3.  Different  ministries  manage  the  public  institutions.  The  Directorate  for  Technical \nEducation of the Ministry of Education (MOE) manages polytechnic and monotechnic institutes \nand technical schools and colleges; the Ministry of Labor manages technical training centers; \nthe  Ministry  of  Textile  manages  textile  vocational  centers;  and  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture \nmanages agricultural training institutes. The private institutions are mostly general secondary \nschools offering TVET courses alongside the general secondary curriculum. While the private \nTVET institutions are numerous, they are mostly small with an average of about 6 teachers and \n75 students per institution, compared with about 16 teachers and 272 students of the public \nsector, although their student\u2013teacher ratios are not too different. In addition, other ministries \nand agencies provide nonformal TVET courses.1\n4.  Formal TVET in Bangladesh consists of three program offerings\u2014basic, certificate, and \ndiploma\u2014with class (or grade) 8 completion a minimum entry qualification. Basic trade (basic \nskill standard certificate or national skills standard-basic) is a 360-hour skills training course \nfocusing mainly on practical skills with some theory requiring class 8 education. This is offered \nmainly at technical training centers and technical schools and colleges. The secondary school \ncertificate (vocational) (SSC [Voc]) is a 2-year certificate course after class 8, and is attractive to \nstudents because of its equivalency to (i) the SSC of the general education stream, which \nprovides entry to higher education; and (ii)  national skills standard II, which should provide \nentry into the world of work. National skills standard III is awarded after class 9 completion. SSC \n                                                 \n1 These include the Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation, Bangladesh Handloom Board, Bangladesh \nIndustrial Technical Assistance Center, Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation, Bangladesh Power Development \nBoard, Bangladesh Railways, Bangladesh Small and Cottage Industries Corporation, Ministry of Civil Aviation and \nTourism, Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, Ministry of Environment and Forest, \nMinistry of Health, Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development, Ministry of Shipping, Ministry of Social \nWelfare, Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs, and the Ministry of Youth and Sports. \n \n \n ", "26  Appendix 2   \n(Voc)  graduates  may  proceed  to  higher  secondary  certificate  (vocational)  (HSC  [Voc])  for \nanother 2 years after class 10. They also receive two qualifications: entry to polytechnics where \na 15% quota is reserved for them, and national skills standard I if they decide to seek work. \nThese courses are offered at the technical schools and colleges, technical training centers, and \nprivate general schools. The higher secondary certificate (business management) is a 2-year \ncertificate course after class 10, which is offered only in private general schools and colleges. \nSalary subvention of 90% of teacher salaries is provided to nongovernment schools offering the \nSSC (Voc) and HSC (Voc) programs and registered with the Bangladesh Technical Education \nBoard (BTEB). Public and private polytechnic institutions offer four-year postsecondary diploma \ncourses in engineering. In 2004, the number of trades offered in the courses increased from 110 \nto 279, significantly increasing available options to students.  \n5.  NGOs as TVET Providers. NGOs provide a variety of nonformal skills training directed \nto specific target groups such as the poor, women, and the marginalized; however, BTEB \ncurrently does not accredit this training. The majority of NGOs are small and lack physical \nfacilities.  Being  immersed  in  the  communities  that  they  serve,  they  have  the  capability  to \nmobilize large numbers of people anytime, and with some help can effectively deliver quality \ntraining. Some NGOs have been highly effective in delivering skills training and have networks \nthat extend to hard-to-reach areas. They provide an integrated approach to human development \nthat  includes  not  only  skills  supported  with  microcredit,  but  also  teach  appropriate  work \nattitudes. NGOs often mentioned in this context are the Under-Privileged Children\u2019s Education \nProgram, Mirpur Agricultural Workshop and Training School, Caritas Mobile Skills Training, St. \nJoseph\u2019s School, and Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee (BRAC).  \n6.  TVET  in  Industry.  A  study2  undertaken  during  project  preparation  found  that  the \nmajority of workers mainly acquire their skills on-the-job. Those who acquired them formally \nmainly attended technical institutes. The majority (72%) of the firms surveyed indicated that they \nhad no training facilities, and a small subgroup (12%) sent their workers to external training \norganizations for upgrading.   \n7.  Some employer associations have training establishments. The Bangladesh Garments \nManufacturers Export Association established the Institute of Fashion and Technology as a fully \nself-financed  training  institute.  Employers  established  the  Chittagong  Skills  Development \nCenter, which is a model of industry\u2013government cooperation. Development agencies and \nindustry have partnered with MOE to upgrade industry-specific institutes for textiles, glass and \nceramics, and leather. In addition, industry-specific training is available for railway, air, and \nmarine operations. The Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry received development \nagency assistance to establish logistics training.  \n8.  Some labor brokers have their own training programs mainly to supply workers for major \nconstruction projects, e.g., pipelines and bridges, and for international employment. Some of the \nnumbers are significant and aim to fulfill international standards, e.g., a contract to train and \nsupply 20,000 construction workers in 2007 for employment in Singapore. \n                                                 \n2 The survey was commissioned to analyze the job-market situation, trade and skills requirements in industries, and \ngrowth of employment opportunities in six divisions in Bangladesh. The sample involved 223 firms in 24 industries \npurposively distributed by division and by type of industry. About 50% of the sample firms were located in Dhaka, \n23% in Chittagong, and the rest were in the other four divisions. Forty percent of the firms had more than 200 \nemployees, 21% between 100 and 200, 36% between 15 and 100, and 3% less than 15. Trained field interviewers \nused a survey questionnaire to conduct face-to-face interviews with concerned managers of the sample firms. \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  27 \nB.   TVET Issues  \n9.  Training Quality. The quality of education and training is generally reflected in students\u2019 \npass rates in BTEB\u2019s terminal external examination. During 2000\u20132004, the average pass rate \nfor SSC (Voc) was about 45% for both male and female students or, conversely, 55% of those \nwho finish SSC (Voc) fail to pass the final examination. No data is available on the pass rate of \nHSC (Voc).  \n10.  The low pass rate for SSC (Voc) can be attributed to a number of factors affecting \ninstruction quality. One is the short supply of qualified TVET teachers. The sudden expansion of \nTVET programs, particularly private and nongovernment, has not been matched by an equal \nsupply of teachers. The majority of the teachers hired have no training on pedagogy and lack \nindustry experience; no continuing staff development is available to address this deficiency. \nBTEB  estimates  that  about  24,000  TVET  teachers  in  the  private  sector  need  training.  In \naddition, all teachers need to be trained in the new competency-based curricula. Monitoring of \nactual teacher performance in the classrooms or workshops is lacking.  \n11.  The capacity of TVET teacher training institutions is limited. The Vocational Teachers \nTraining Institute (VTTI) has capacity for training 240 teachers only, and focuses training on \ndeveloping new teachers for eight trades. The Technical Teachers Training College (TTTC) has \ncapacity for 80 teachers, but has been producing fewer graduates. In addition, VTTI and TTTC \nserve only the MOE TVET teachers, leaving other training providers (i.e., government, private, \nor NGO) to seek other TVET teacher training programs. The VTTI and TTTC programs need to \nbe  refocused  to  provide  good  quality  training,  including  in-service  training,  to  more  TVET \nteachers from both MOE- and non-MOE-administered institutions. The facilities of VTTI and \nTTTC need to be upgraded and capacity increased to provide outreach to private/NGO sector \nteachers. \n12.  Lack  of  equipment  compounds  the  situation  in  most  training  institutions,  in  some \ninstances  outdated  equipment  or  equipment  is  no  longer  operating.  In  some  schools  new \nequipment is not used as instructors have not been trained in its operation. Consequently, the \npractical component of the curriculum is not effectively taught. And since most of the institutions \ndo not have a linkage with industry, the industry attachment component of the curriculum is not \neffectively implemented.  \n13.  Relevance of Training Programs. Ultimately, the main measure of success of the \nTVET system if it is to significantly contribute to poverty reduction is whether its graduates find \ngainful employment, preferably in the trade areas they are trained for. A World Bank tracer \nstudy in 2006 involving 2,302 graduates of public and private TVET institutions in 2003 found \nthe proportion of employed to be low (see Table A2.1). The proportion of employed was highest \namong the higher secondary certificate (vocational) (HSC [Voc]) graduates at 30%, followed by \ndiploma graduates at 21%, and basic trades at 18%. These courses, however, account for only \na small proportion of total enrollment. While the lowest proportions of employed were among the \nSSC (Voc) graduates (4%) and HSC (business management) graduates (5%), the proportions \nof their graduates pursuing higher education were the highest. This finding indicates that these \ncourses appear to be catering to a clientele who can afford to pursue higher education and have \nstrong white-collar job aspirations; this is not consistent with the objectives of the national \npoverty reduction strategy. Across all the respondents, only 9% were employed, 45% were \npursuing higher education and the rest were unemployed. Of those who were employed, about \n38% took less than 6 months to get a job and another 16% took up to a year. The employment \noutcomes of graduates of the public and private institutions indicated little difference.  \n ", "28  Appendix 2   \nTable A2.1: Distribution of Formal TVET Students After Graduation \nItems  Employed  Self-Employed  Higher  Unemployed  Total  \n(%)  (%)  Education (%)  (%)  (%)a\nBasic Trades  14.1  4.0  23.7  58.1  100.0 \nSSC (Voc)    3.1  0.9  47.4  48.7  100.0 \nHSC (Voc)  28.6  1.1  20.9  49.5  100.0 \nHSC (BM)    4.7  0.7  53.5  41.1  100.0 \nDiploma and Others   18.2  2.4  32.9  46.4  100.0 \nTotal    7.3  1.3  44.7  46.8  100.0 \na Totals may not add up to 100.0 due to rounding-off. \nNote: The number of respondents is 2,302. The students all graduated in 2003. \nSource: World Bank staff calculations from World Bank's 2006 tracer study of formal TVET students who graduated in \n2003. \n.14.  In general, the low employment of graduates reflects the lack of linkage of the TVET \nsystem  with  the  labor  market.  The  identification  of  courses  is  not  based  on  regular  and \nsystematic  assessment  of  market  needs  but  rather  more  in  response  to  social  demand. \nEmployers have no inputs in setting competency standards for the courses or in determining the \ncurriculum. On the other hand, successful NGOs such as Under-Privileged Children\u2019s Education \nProgram,  Mirpur  Agricultural  Workshop  and  Training  School,  and  the  industry-managed \nChittagong Skills Development Center provide models of effective TVET training programs. The \nhigh  employment  rate  of  the  graduates  of  their  short  and  long  courses  demonstrates  the \nimportance of strong linkage with industry, which is one of their main strengths. The process of \nselecting students is mainly dependent on academic marks and external examinations, and \ndoes not consider aptitudes and aspirations. \n15.  The formal TVET system has minimal impact on the economy and poverty reduction; of \nthe total labor force in 2003, only 0.12% received technical training from the system. One of the \nfeatures of the existing system is its focus on long courses such as the SSC (Voc) and HSC \n(Voc); the majority of successful graduates pursue further studies. While this helps keep young \nadolescents in school, it is an expensive route for accessing further education. Also contributing \nto the low output is the lack of formal BTEB recognition of successful NGO and industry \ndelivered programs such as those offered by Mirpur Agricultural Workshop and Training School, \nCaritas, Under-Privileged Children\u2019s Education Program, other NGOs, and the construction \nindustry.  \n16.  TVET can be made more relevant to the informal sector. The productivity of the sector \ncan be improved by upgrading skills in certain occupations, e.g., motorbike repair, repair of farm \nimplements, food processing, and carving. Mirpur Agricultural Workshop and Training School, \nBangladesh Rural Advancement Committee, and other successful NGOs have a number of \ntraining programs catering to the informal rural subsector that have high employment rates. \nUsually  these  are  linked  with  microcredit.  Such  programs,  which  incorporate  modules  on \nentrepreneurship, can be mainstreamed by converting to competency-based training (CBT) \n(some already are) and recognized by BTEB so that they can be scaled up with Government \nand  development  agency  support.  The  competency-based  approach  to  skills  training \nemphasizes the acquisition of skills used in the workplace. Skills are according to the standards \nrelated to industry\u2019s needs. Often, CBT is delivered in modules. Students progress to the next \nmodule after demonstrating acquisition of the skill rather than after a fixed time frame, and \nstudents can potentially complete training programs faster. \n17.  One of the main features of the formal TVET system is limited opportunities. All its \nprograms, including the 6-month basic trades and SSC (Voc), require class 8 as minimum entry \n ", "  Appendix 2  29 \nqualification. This automatically excludes the majority who do not complete class 8. The main \nclientele are mostly male (share of female enrollment is only 26%) who are not necessarily poor. \nThe TVET system needs to urgently diversify its clientele if it is to be an effective instrument for \npoverty reduction. Quality CBT modular courses offer the best vehicle for the TVET system to \nreach out to the poor. Opening the TVET system to the older poor through short CBT courses \nthat  do  not  necessarily  require  class  8  for  enrolment  will  significantly  increase  its  output, \nmaximize the utilization rate of facilities, reduce unit cost, and make the system truly relevant. \nGender policies promoting more female participation can also be implemented. \n18.  Governance and Management Structure. The scope of the TVET subsector is much \nwider  and  more  diverse  than  generally  understood.  It  encompasses  a  large  number  of \ninstitutions and activities. However, its impact has hardly been felt, partly because its various \ncomponents lack a unifying vision in which  each has a clearly defined role. The need to \nrationalize the disparate efforts in TVET by putting it under a single regulatory framework to \nprovide a unified and coherent direction was acknowledged as early as 1979 with the creation of \nthe National Council for Skills Development and Training (NCSDT). NCSDT was to provide \nmacro-level policy direction and other national services related to skills training, coordinate the \nefforts of different agencies involved in skills training to avoid duplication of efforts, and develop \nnational competency standards. Despite the reconstitution of its membership in 1991, NCSDT \nhas not functioned as intended. Several factors have been cited for its lack of effectiveness, \nincluding (i) membership is too big and difficult to coordinate and organize, although this was \npartly addressed in the revised composition; (ii) many members do not have the expertise nor \ninterest in formulating policies related to the development of the workforce for crafts; (iii) the \nNCSDT secretariat (Bureau of Manpower, Employment and Training [BMET]) does not have \nsufficient resources and expertise to provide the necessary support to NCSDT; and (iv) BMET \nlacks autonomy, which is needed for effective functioning as the NCSDT secretariat. \n 19.  While the initial attempt to provide a unified governance and management structure did \nnot work as expected, the need for it remains even more valid and urgent today. The options \nare either to reactivate NCSDT and build on the existing legal framework, or create a completely \nnew but equivalent body. Presently, MOE has overall responsibility for making policy decisions \nfor all education, including technical and vocational education. The execution of policies is \nvested in two of its agencies: Directorate for Technical Education and BTEB. Under the existing \ninstitutional arrangements, a major component is conspicuously missing\u2014the involvement of \nprivate sector representatives, including employers, private training providers, and NGOs. They \nneed to be involved not only for strategy and policy but for operations as well.   \n20.  The management of training institutions needs to be addressed. Although BMET seems \nto  be  progressing  in  decentralization,  the  overly  centralized  system  of  the  Directorate  for \nTechnical Education does not allow its principals to manage. They do not have authority to \ndecide  on key  areas necessary  for  effective  functioning  of  their  institutions,  e.g.,  hiring  of \nteachers, discontinuing low-demand programs, and offering market-demanded programs. With \nclear guidelines and transparent procedures, heads of institutions should be able to select their \nteachers  for  approved  posts  and  have  the  authority  to  reward  or  penalize  depending  on \nperformance. They should also be allowed to hire on a part-time basis. The authority to close \ndown courses in trade areas with low market demand so that the resources can be channeled to \nthe more promising areas should also be provided. With respect to short courses, principals \nshould even have greater authority to be able to respond quickly to market needs. However, \nwhile  autonomy  is  certainly  needed  if  management  is  to  be  accountable  for  performance, \nmanagement\u2019s  readiness  to  assume  greater  responsibility  must  be  considered.  Thus,  a \ncontinuing management development program to build management capacity is needed.  \n ", "30  Appendix 2   \n21.  Another area that needs urgent attention is the information system for the subsector. \nAggregated and time-series data for planning and managing that are normally available in \ngeneral education are not available for TVET. These include data on the number of TVET \nproviders by type and location, programs, enrolment, teachers, attendance rate, dropout rate, \ncompletion rate, pass rate, and unit cost. A TVET management information system equivalent to \nthe education management information system of general education is needed.  \n ", "  Appendix 3  31 \nLESSONS  \n  Incorporating Lessons Identified  \nLessons   in Project Design \n \n1.

With a view to supporting the national poverty reduction strategy goal of expanding skill \ndevelopment to more Bangladeshis, the Project will strengthen the institutional capacity of \npublic and private technical and vocational education and training (TVET) providers to deliver \ntraining programs comprising short competency-based training (CBT) courses developed under \nthe Project. The Project1 will assist about 60 public training institutions, 15 private training \ninstitutions,  and  10  nongovernment  organization-managed  training  centers.  About  six \npartnerships between the industry associations in the sector working committees (SWCs) and \nexisting  public  TVET  institutions  will  be  supported;  this  can  include  strengthening  industry \ntraining programs in partnership with TVET institutions and establishing new partnerships as \nnecessary, including management of government TVET institutions by industry associations on \npilot basis. Shortlisted TVET institutions will prepare program improvement plans (PIPs). TVET \ninstitutions will be selected based on a set of criteria to be approved by the project steering \ncommittee and the Asian Development Bank (ADB).  \n \n2.  Eligible Items for Support. The Project will support expenditures necessary to upgrade \nthe delivery of CBT courses in the selected technology areas to the desired quality as indicated \nin  the  approved  skills  and  training  standards.  These  include  (i)  rehabilitation  of  existing \nclassrooms, laboratories, or workshops used for the selected programs; (ii) construction of \nadditional classrooms, laboratories, or workshops attached to existing buildings, if all existing \nfacilities are demonstrated to be fully utilized and accommodating the new CBT courses would \nbe  difficult;  (iii)  purchase  of  equipment  and  furniture  for  classrooms,  laboratories,  and \nworkshops for the selected programs; (iv) purchase of books, reference materials, teaching \naids, and other supplementary materials; (v) rehabilitation or construction of basic water and \nsanitation facilities including separate toilets for women; and (vi) consumables for conducting \nthe new CBT courses. \n \n3.  Draft Criteria for Selecting the Short List of TVET Institutions for Assistance. ADB \nand the project steering committee will approve the criteria.

Economic Analysis \n \n1.  Labor Demand. The industry sector leads recent growth performance in Bangladesh, \nfollowed by the services sector. As a result, the economy is experiencing a gradual structural \ntransformation  that  requires  a  more  technically  skilled  labor  force.  At  the  same  time, \ninternational demand for Bangladeshi labor is growing. During 1995\u20132005, about 2.58 million \nBangladeshi workers were working outside of the country, of which 48% were unskilled, 15% \nsemiskilled, 33% skilled, and only 4% professional. To withstand increasing competition from \nother labor-exporting countries, continuous skills upgrading is required. \n \n2.  Labor  Supply.  However,  with  the  growing  demand  for  skilled  labor,  a  sizeable \nproportion  of  the  labor  force  has  insufficient  or  inappropriate  schooling.  Of  those  that  are \nschooled, only 58,000 workers (55,000 male and 5,000 female) in the labor force received \ntechnical or vocational education; this represents 0.12% of the 46.3 million in the labor force. \n \n3.  Shortcomings of the Technical and Vocational Education (TVET) System. A major \nweakness of the current TVET system is the considerable mismatch between the system\u2019s \noutputs  and  labor  market  needs.  The  poor  condition  of  the  TVET  system  is  the  result  of  \n(i) teaching equipment lacking or malfunctioning, (ii) industrial attachment component of the \ncurriculum rarely implemented, and the curriculum not relevant to or in demand by the industry, \n(iii) shortage of qualified teachers with practical skills, and (iv) focus on long courses. The \nsystem could greatly enhance its output by utilizing its slack capacity for the more employment-\noriented short courses and older students. The overall impact of the current TVET system on \nthe economy is modest. A tracer study conducted by the World Bank involving 2,302 graduates \nof both public and private TVET institutions concluded that about 9% of TVET graduates were \nemployed (7.3% wage-employed and 1.3% self-employed), 45% were pursuing further studies, \nand 47% were unemployed. \n \n4.  Solutions and Project Contribution. The Project responds to the analyzed needs and \nweaknesses of the TVET system and aims to increase its efficiency and effectiveness. It will \nenhance the relevance of the training programs for the domestic and international labor markets \nby piloting a partnership mechanism between the key players on the supply and demand side in \nthree crucial industry sectors: textiles and garments, construction, and light engineering. In \naddition, a select group of nongovernment organizations (NGOs) involved in the development of \nnonfarm technical skills will be organized to address the needs for technical skills of the informal \nsector.  \n \n5.  By  upgrading  the  facilities  and  learning  materials,  through  training  of  teachers  in \nselected TVET institutions, and the provision of market-oriented short courses, the Project will \ndirectly benefit more than 68,000 out-of-school youths, and unemployed and underemployed \nadults who will graduate from the short competency-based training (CBT) courses of the public \nand selected private institutions during the 5 years of project implementation. An additional \n20,000 students are expected to take short courses after project completion. Also about 4,000 \nteachers will directly benefit from intensive teacher training to upgrade their technical and \npedagogical skills. In addition, the more than 50,000 students that attend certificate and diploma \ncourses in these institutions every year will indirectly benefit from the Project as their courses \nwill be taught by better trained teachers in better equipped facilities. This is expected to result in \n                                                 \n1 Supplementary Appendix D provides more detailed economic, poverty impact, and financial analyses. \n ", "52   Appendix 16   \nbetter employment outcomes. In addition, the Project will build the capacity of these institutions \nto provide short CBT courses to more than 100,000 trainees per year who are denied access to \nlong courses because of the class 8 barrier to entry.  \n \n6.  Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR). To assess the economic efficiency of the \nProject, the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) over 20 years was estimated.  \n \n7.  Economic  Benefits.  The  economic  benefits  are  derived  mainly  from  (i)  increased \naccess to skills training; and (ii) improved relevance and quality of skills training through the \npartnership  with  employers,  revision  of  curriculum,  and  teacher  training  components.  The \neconomic  impacts  are  estimated  using  future  salary  increments  as  a  result  of  completing \nmarket-oriented short-term skills training. The estimate is based on conservative assumptions, \nusing  the  minimum  wage  of  local  workers  in  the  ready-made  garments  and  construction \nindustries, rather than market wages. Increase in access is represented by increased enrollment \nin new short-term training programs. The Project will fund the cost of an additional 68,200 \nstudents in short-term training programs in 5 years, 36,000 through the strengthened TVET \ninstitutions and 32,200 through the market-responsive skills training programs. The additional \ntraining will be terminated by project completion, although about 20,000 students are expected \nto continue to take short-term courses on a cost-recovery basis after the Project. Two types of \nemployment opportunities are available after training: local and international labor markets. The \nanalysis assumes that unemployed and unskilled workers will become semiskilled workers by \nobtaining the appropriate skills through training. Improved relevance and quality of training \nraises labor productivity and is measured by the extent to which training completers earn more \nthan the minimum wage. Similarly, improved relevance of training will improve the employability \nof graduates, and will hence result in a higher employment probability.2 The teacher training \nprograms will also have a spillover effect on the employability of secondary school certificate \n(vocational)  graduates,  which  will  improve  by  benefiting  from  training  from  better  trained \nteachers in better equipped institutions.  \n \n8.  Economic Costs. The economic costs are divided into (i) investment cost of the Project, \n(ii) recurrent cost, and (iii) private and opportunity costs. The total cost of the Project, net of \ntaxes, is estimated at $58.9 million. Recurrent cost includes additional administrative expenses \nof improving the provision of short-term training. After the Project, the recurrent cost remains at \nits fifth year value of $0.6 million. Private costs include the out-of-pocket expenses of trainees \nfor a short-term, 3-month training program. The opportunity cost is equivalent to the income that \na trainee would otherwise receive when not engaged in the short-term training. Based on these \nassumptions (Table A16.1), the Project is estimated to yield a net present value of $47.4 million, \nassuming a discount rate of 12.0%. The EIRR is estimated at 13.9%. The actual EIRR is likely \nto be higher in view of economywide multiplier effects of remittances. \n \n9.  Sensitivity Analysis. A sensitivity analysis was undertaken on the basis of alternative \nassumptions  on  the  extent  to  which  the  Project  achieves  improved  access  and  external \nefficiency for local and overseas employment. In the low case scenario, improvements through \nthe project are 25% less than the target, the high case scenario implies 125% achievement of \nthe targets. The results can be found in Table A16.2: \n                                                 \n2   In the formal TVET system, the World Bank survey (see Appendix 2) found that 18% of the respondents with basic \nskill certificates were employed. While no aggregate data were available on the employment rates of short-term \nprograms outside the formal TVET system, discussions and meetings with successful NGOs and labor brokers \nindicated very high employment rates for their graduates. Given this information and that the Project will be \nsupporting short-term training programs, a 50% baseline value is assumed for the employment rate of graduates of \nthese programs without the Project.      \n ", "  Appendix 16             53 \n                              \nTable A16.1: Assumptions for Economic Internal Rate of Return Estimates \nEconomic Benefit of Increased Access   \nImpact of short-term vocational training on annual salary    \nTrainees who were unemployed and seek local employment   $681 \nTrainees who were unemployed and seek international employment   $1,920 \nTrainees who were unskilled workers and seek local employment   $200 \nTrainees who were unskilled workers and seek international employment  $1,439 \nEconomic Benefit of Improved Quality of Training   \nDegree of improvement in earning    5% \nEconomic Benefit of Improved External Efficiency   \nJob placement rate among training completers without Project   50% \nJob placement rate among training completers with Project  75% \nProportion of completers taking up international employment   12.5% \nEconomic Cost of Proposed Project   \nAnnual recurrent cost after the Project   $626,000 \nPrivate cost (per training program per trainee)   $19 \nOpportunity cost (per training program per trainee)   $120 \n  Source: Asian Development Bank staff estimate.  \n \nTable A16.2: Economic Internal Rate of Return  \nEconomic Internal Rate of Return  Baseline  Less 25%  Increase 25% \n1.

Bangladesh's poverty incidence measured in terms of $1 per day stands at 36.3% in \n2005, the highest among South Asian countries. The Project will contribute to poverty reduction \nin two ways. First, it will promote expansion of the scope of the current TVET system toward \nserving the poor. The current system predominantly offers longer courses, which are costly to \nthe poor. By focusing on short courses that do not necessarily require class 8 for enrolment, the \nProject improves the opportunities for the poor to enter the TVET system. Secondly, the Project \naddresses also the needs of poor communities. The Project will support the plan of the Ministry \nof  Education  (MOE)  to  introduce  short-term  skills  training  in  poor  communities.  Project \nassistance will be provided in two modes: (i) establishment of multipurpose training workshops \nfor  vocational  trade  courses  in  selected  schools,  and  (ii)  assistance  to  selected  TVET \ninstitutions to provide skills training. The multipurpose training workshops will be used to provide \nskills training to community members, particularly the unemployed and underemployed school \nleavers, women, and adults, including those from poor communities (about 7,200 trainees). \n \nC.  Financial Analysis \n \n11.  The financial analysis determines the fiscal impact and the sustainability of the Project \non the Government\u2019s budget during the 5 years project implementation. The Government\u2019s \nshare  in  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $16.7  million  over  5  years  and  will  comprise  mainly \nincremental recurrent cost, taxes and duties, and a share in special programs. Two scenarios \nwere  prepared  to  analyze  its  affordability  (i) a  high  case  scenario where  the Government \neducation budget was projected for 2008 to 2013 based on the trend of actual budgets from \n1999 to 2005; and (ii) a low case scenario where the education budget remains at its projected \n ", "54   Appendix 16   \n2008 level until 2013. For both scenarios, the annual share of the Government in the project \ncost, together with estimated commitments in two ongoing Asian Development Bank (ADB)-\nfunded projects, the Secondary Education Sector Development Program and the Teaching \nQuality Improvement Project,3 are computed as a percentage of the annual education budget. \nIn the high case scenario, the Government\u2019s annual commitment as a percentage of the total \neducation budget averages 0.85% over the 5-year life of the Project. In the low case scenario, \nthe Government\u2019s annual commitment as a percentage of the education budget increases to \n0.93% over the 5-year life of the Project. The Government\u2019s share in the Project constitutes a \nsmall proportion of the overall education budget, and is hence deemed sustainable from a \nfinancial perspective. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n3 ADB. 2004.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.    Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nBangladesh\u2019s national poverty reduction strategy (NPRS) recognizes the potential contribution of technical and \nvocational education and training (TVET) to reducing poverty by providing employable skills, particularly to those who \ndropped out of school early and are already of employable age, and to the large pool of unemployed and \nunderemployed adults. Skills training can play a major role in giving people income-earning opportunities. Skills \ntraining in occupational areas needed by the labor market increases the likelihood of employment and self-\nemployment of trainees. The poverty reduction strategy calls for reform of the TVET system by making it more \nmarket-responsive, addressing training needs of the underprivileged who do not complete class 8, collaborating with \nthe private sector and nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and making its training programs more flexible in terms \nof duration, curriculum, and students\u2019 academic qualifications, among others. \nThe Skills Development Project (the Project) addresses the TVET needs in Bangladesh. Focusing mainly on short \ncompetency-based training (CBT) courses, the Project will open the formal TVET system to out-of-school youth who \nare of employable age, women, and unemployed and underemployed adults. It will extend the system\u2019s reach to \npoverty areas in collaboration with its industry and NGO partners. The Project also aims to improve the relevance \nand quality of TVET programs.  \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention  \n1.  Key Issues  \nBangladesh\u2019s formal TVET system produces a low number of training graduates and thus has a minimal impact on \npoverty reduction. The main clientele are currently the youth, about three-quarters of whom are male, who complete \nclass 8 and have strong white-collar job aspirations. The class 8 barrier, the minimum entry requirement to the formal \nTVET system, automatically excludes the large majority, many of whom are poor and do not complete schooling up \nto that level. The formal TVET system also does not recognize good training provided by agencies not under the \numbrella of the Ministry of Education (MOE) nor does it recognize good training provided by NGOs. The relevance \nand quality of its formal training programs are low; employment and pass rates of graduates need to be increased. \nThe matching of skills training programs need to be improved to increase the employment rates of trainees.  \nTraining programs can be made more flexible in terms of duration (more short-term, modular training) and academic \nqualifications (less than class 8), and made more relevant by coordinating with employers, industries, and NGOs. \nQuality can also be improved by providing training institutions with the appropriate equipment, a regular supply of \ntraining materials, and TVET teachers with pedagogical and technological training. \n2. Design Features \nThe Project will strengthen the capacity of the TVET systems to provide market-responsive, short-term skills training \nto more Bangladeshis. Short, modular CBT courses will be developed and will provide greater flexibility, in terms of \nduration and academic qualification requirements. The training programs will not necessarily require class 8 for \nenrolment, which will expand access to the TVET system to those that did not reach this required level, many of \nwhom are poor. The facilities of TVET institutions will be upgraded to expand the capacity for delivering short, \nrelevant training programs and thus will provide more space for students. The Project will also establish training \nworkshops in selected poor communities, which will make training more accessible to the poor. Thus, the Project will \nopen TVET institutions to a larger number of trainees in short CBT courses, most of whom would have been denied \naccess because of the class 8 barrier to entry. As the training programs will be demand-driven and based on \nindustry-set or recognized standards, opportunities for employment and self-employment opportunities of trainees \nwill improve.     \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \nBangladesh made big strides in human development from the 1980s to the 2000s. In education, the primary gross \nenrollment rate is over 100% and gender parity has been achieved in both primary and secondary education. \nBangladesh\u2019s population growth rate was halved over two decades, and infant mortality rates decreased by a quarter \nbetween 1989\u20131993 and 1995\u20131999. However, despite this progress, it has remained one of the poorest countries in \nthe world, with more than half of its citizens living below the poverty line. Many Bangladeshi households are \nvulnerable to income risks. In addition to shocks faced by individuals, e.g. illness, death, and dowries, the country is \nprone to repeated natural disasters in the form of floods, droughts, cyclones, and riverbank erosion, which affect \nbroad segments of the population. These challenges are compounded by a population density of roughly 800 people \nper square kilometer\u2014one of the highest in the world. Although poverty in urban areas is lower than in rural areas, it \n ", "56   Appendix 17   \nis on the rise, mainly due to rural\u2013urban migration. Heads of poor households have lower education attainment than \nin nonpoor households. Every year, after planting the main rice crop, the poorer section of the population, who \ndepend mostly on agriculture, become underemployed, if not unemployed.  \nYouth coming from poor households are less likely to complete class 8. Once they have left school, some find work \nopportunities  without  specific  skills  training.  During  project  preparation,  school-leavers  expressed  interest  in \nvocational training, however opportunities are limited. While good short vocational training may be offered by some \nNGOs, until recently, the Government has not taken any step to recognize them. Employers and training providers \nindicate that not all occupations require class 8. Vocational training can be offered as a short program and in a \nmodular manner over time. Employers, particularly those that are export-oriented, expressed the need for more \ntrained workers to meet the demands of the market and remain competitive in the international market.  \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \nConsultation  with  a  variety  of  stakeholders  was  undertaken  using  focus  group  discussions,  workshops,  and \ninterviews. Focus group discussions included TVET students, parents, TVET teachers and trainers, and employers in \nthe six divisions of Bangladesh. Employers, industry associations, and development partners were also consulted. \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring? \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \nConsultation and participation of representatives of industries and major NGOs will be undertaken in the Project. \nMembers of the sector working committee will mostly be from industries and employers to identify the needed skills \ntraining. TVET institutions that will receive funds for upgrading their program facilities will have advisers from the \nindustries and employers. In working with poor communities, the Project will work with NGOs to identify their training \nneeds. Information dissemination activities, among others, will be undertaken and will include the use of popular \nmedia to reach out to youth and project a positive image of productive TVET. A social marketing plan will be \nprepared and implemented. \nC.  Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues \nWith  the  share  of  agriculture  in  the  national  product  decreasing,  the  employment  of  women  is  also  being \ntransformed. Between 1995 and 2003, women in the labor force grew from 5.4 million to 10.3 million, and their labor \nforce participation rate increased from 15.8% to 26.1%. This increase is largely fueled by the growth of the textiles \nand ready-made garments industries. Moreover, 15,000 women took up international employment during 1991\u2013\n2000, mainly as skilled labor to the manufacturing subsector and as household maids to Middle East and Southeast \nAsian countries. Occupational patterns differ between men and women. A higher proportion of women (88%) are \nemployed in agriculture than men (56%). Men earn more than women. In the formal manufacturing subsector, 19% \nof women as opposed to 9% of men earn below the poverty line. Operations of the ready-made garment industry \ndepends exclusively on women workers. In 2003, ready-made garments employed about 1.4 million women, \ncomprising 93% of its workforce. The skills needed for the job are mostly self-taught or acquired on the job. On the \njob, little investment is made by the ready-made garment entrepreneurs or government to upgrade the skills either \nprior to entry in the labor force or during employment. If the ready-made garment subsector were to diversify into \nhigher quality and more skill-intensive products, which is already happening in knitted garments, female workers will \nneed to be upgraded. \nThe experience in nonformal education activities indicate that women prefer skills that do not take them out of their \nhomesteads. This results in acquiring traditional skills like poultry raising, embroidery, and tailoring. However, these \nskills cannot ensure a decent income. Employment opportunities for women were and still are limited compared with \nthose for men. The factors that contribute to limited job opportunities for women include lack of social recognition, \nlack of education, lack of skills training, restrictions on women\u2019s mobility, lower social status of women, and strict \ngender division of labor. Researchers a are suggesting that the efficiency of women workers needs to be increased \nby reducing the gender gap in education and training, by introducing schemes for upgrading technology in market-\nbased  activities  within  households,  and  improving  the  institutional  setup  that  impacts  on  women-dominated \nindustries.  \nWomen's lower participation in TVET contributes to their limited access to the labor market. Women are employed in \nlower-skilled occupations, occupying the lower range of vocational skills that are gender-stereotypical. Of the over \n241,000 students enrolled in TVET in 2005, 26% were girls, who were mostly enrolled in secondary school certificate \n(vocational)  and  higher  secondary  certificate  (vocational)  programs;  data  for  enrolment  in  short-term  training \nprograms is not available. Of the more than 200 operating government institutions, only one is for women. More \nrecently, the Government established four polytechnics for women in four divisional districts and initiated the \nestablishment of two more in another two divisional districts.  \n ", "  Appendix 17             57 \n                             \n2.

(iv) A gender and indigenous \npeoples specialist will support project implementation, including helping develop a situation \nanalysis, strategy, and action plan for the participation of indigenous people in skills training.  \n(v) The project implementation unit (PIU) and the Directorate of Technical Education (DTE) will \ncollect  project  baseline  ethnicity-disaggregated  data,  and,  thereafter,  regularly  collect  and \nmaintain ethnicity-disaggregated data in its database. (vi) The PIU, in cooperation with DTE will \nregularly analyze project output and impact indicators, including by ethnicity.  \n \nB.  Impact of the Project on Indigenous Peoples \n \n2.  The project activities are not expected to have a negative impact on indigenous people, \nrather, implementation will improve the quality and relevance of skills training for all who are \neligible  and  would  like  to  avail  of  it.  This  will  contribute  to  increasing  the  likelihood  of \nemployment after training.  \n \n3.  With the increased interaction between government training program developers and the \nindustry  through  sector  working  committees  (SWCs),  competency  standards  and  training \ncurricula will have greater relevance to the needs of the labor market. The provision of in-\nservice  teacher  training  and  improvement  in  the  facilities  of  certain  training  programs  will \nimprove the quality of training. The provision of training equipment will provide students with the \nopportunity to access practical training and thus improve the quality of their training.  \n \n4.  More skills training programs will be offered in occupational areas immediately needed \nby  the  labor  market.  Training  will  be  short  and  competency-based,  with  the  competency \nstandards  and  training  standards  specified  in  coordination  with  industries.  The  training \nadmission  eligibility  standards  will  be  specified  in  coordination  with  industry  associations \naccording to the occupations\u2019 skill standards. Training programs will be open to everyone and \nwill be held in venues that do not restrict admission to any indigenous group. Multipurpose \ntraining  workshops  will  be  constructed  in  poor  communities  for  skills  training  delivery;  the \ncommunity skills training programs will respond to labor market needs. \n \n5.  By offering more short training programs that do not necessarily require completion of \nclass 8 for eligibility, more Bangladeshis, including many indigenous people, will be able to avail \nof skills training. Daily training allowance will be provided to poor students, some of whom \nbelong to indigenous groups, to reduce the cost of attendance. This will encourage them to \nenroll and complete their skills training programs.  \n \n \n ", "                                                                                                                                   Appendix 19  61\nC.  Procedures \n \n6.  The screening of project impacts on indigenous peoples is a continuing process that \ncategorizes the impacts and identifies subsequent approaches and resource requirements to \naddress  identified  issues.  Projects  are  categorized  by  the  significance  of  their  impacts  on \nindigenous people. The significance is decided by scrutinizing the type, location, scale, nature, \nand magnitude of a project\u2019s potential impacts.  \n \n7.  An indigenous peoples development framework is a policy and procedural framework for \nindigenous peoples development plans that are developed for subprojects, components, or \ninvestments, and are approved during loan implementation. The Government will prepare a \nspecific action for indigenous people groups for subprojects with limited impacts on indigenous \npeoples or when there is a risk that the project may not bring intended benefits to the affected \nindigenous peoples within a specific plan. \n \n8.  An  indigenous  peoples  development  plan  addresses  (i)  aspirations,  needs,  and \npreferred  options  of  those  affected;  (ii)  local  social  organization,  cultural  beliefs,  ancestral \nterritory, and resource use patterns among those affected; (iii) potential positive and negative \nimpacts; (iv) measures to avoid, mitigate, or compensate for the adverse effects; (v) measures \nto ensure project benefits will accrue to indigenous peoples; (vi) measure to strengthen social, \nlegal, and technical capabilities of government institutions to address indigenous people issues; \n(vii)  the  possibility  of  involving  local  organizations  and  nongovernment  organizations  with \nexpertise in indigenous people issues; (viii) budget allocation; and (ix) monitoring. \n \n9.  An indigenous peoples\u2019 specific action may take the form of (i) incorporating indigenous \npeoples (who might be excluded) into the project beneficiary group, (ii) incorporating indigenous \npeoples\u2019 specific needs into the project plan, and (iii) a common community action plan where \nindigenous peoples live with non-indigenous peoples in the same project location. \n \n10.  The indigenous peoples development plans or specific actions will be submitted to the \nAsian Development Bank for review and concurrence. \n \nD.   Implementation Arrangements \n \n11.  The gender and indigenous peoples specialist will assist the PIU in implementing this \nstrategy, including capacity-building of PIU and relevant DTE personnel for screening project \nactivities. The project director, with the support of the head of the PIU monitoring and evaluation \nunit,  will  undertake  required  screening  for  project  impacts  on  indigenous  people.  Where \napplicable and necessary, the specialist will assist the PIU develop a corrective action plan for \nindigenous people to have equal access to the training program. \n \nE.   Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n12.  The Executing Agency, the Ministry of Education, will be responsible for monitoring and \nevaluation  of  activities  related  to  indigenous  peoples.  The  Project  will  collect  ethnicity-\ndisaggregated  data.  The  PIU  will  regularly  analyze  project  output  and  impact  indicators, \nincluding by ethnicity. The gender and indigenous people specialist will build the capacity of the \nPIU and relevant DTE personnel to collect ethnicity-disaggregated project data and ensure that \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  procedures  include  indicators  for  monitoring  impact  on  the \nbeneficiaries. Where applicable and despite all efforts, indigenous peoples still have unequal \naccess to project skill development activities, DTE will provide funding from the project budget \nfor a corrective action plan if such corrective action is necessary. \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20080514183723+08'00'", "Author": "LG", "Creator": "Acrobat PDFMaker 7.0 for Word", "Keywords": "bangladesh skills development project, technical and vocational education and training, tvet capacity system, bangladesh project managements, short skills training programs, adb loan 4799, adb project 39408", "Producer": "Acrobat Elements 7.0 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20080609160816+08'00'", "Company": "Licenced User", "SourceModified": "D:20080514103447", "Title": "Skills Development Project"}}
