THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nand grant to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Fourth Greater Mekong Subregion Corridor Towns \nDevelopment Project. The report also describes the proposed administration of a grant to be \nprovided by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund for the project and if \nthe Board approves the proposed loan and grant, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by \nthe Board, approve the administration of the grant. \n \n2.  The project will improve urban services and enhance regional economic connectivity in \nthe provincial capital towns of Kampong Cham, Kratie, and Stung Treng along the Greater \nMekong  Subregion  (GMS)  Corridor  in  Cambodia.1 It  will  finance  key  urban  environmental \ninfrastructure and enhance institutional effectiveness with a focus on private sector engagement, \ninformation and communication technology (ICT)-based public management systems, and the \npolicy and planning environment for regional economic connectivity.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale  \n \n3.  Macroeconomic context. Cambodia had an estimated population of 15.2 million in 2016, \nspread across 26 provincial towns and numerous district towns. While Cambodia remains almost \n80% rural, urbanization is accelerating and is expected to reach 30% of the national total by 2030. \nProvincial towns have urbanized rapidly while playing an important role in the national economy, \nwhich grew by 7% per year from 2015 to 2017.3 With an increasingly urban economy, urban \nservices  contribute  to  environmentally  sustainable  and  inclusive  growth  by  providing  basic \ninfrastructure  for  businesses  and  households,  creating  jobs,  safeguarding  the  surrounding \nenvironment and ecosystem, and reducing exposure to flooding and other extreme events. \n \n4.  Transport  corridors.  Many  Cambodian  towns  lie  on  important  GMS  corridors  that \nconnect to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Thailand, and Viet Nam.4 They support \nincreasing regional trade and investment and create incentives for local economies in their \nhinterlands. The 1,600 kilometer (km) GMS Central Corridor along the Mekong River crosses 13 \ntowns in two countries, with about 20 million people along the corridor, and generates over $20 \nbillion in regional economic outputs.5 Regional transport connectivity is improving since the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) first approved a loan for National Road 7 in 1999.6 To enhance trade \nand freight movement, a draft national logistic master plan and the national railway master plan \npropose an inland waterway along the Mekong River and new railway lines from Phnom Penh to \nHo Chi Minh City (Viet Nam) through Kampong Cham and Kratie provinces. \n \n5.  Towns along the central corridor. On the GMS Central Corridor, Kampong Cham, \nKratie, and Stung Treng provinces need to promote economic growth in the less-developed \n                                                \n1  The Government of Cambodia uses \u201ctown\u201d and \u201ccity\u201d interchangeably.

Manila. \n4  Southern corridor, Central corridor, and Southern coastal corridor.   \n5   The corridor population comprises the people living 50 km on either side of the Mekong River. ADB calculated the \neconomic output based on the provincial gross domestic product per capita multiplied by the corridor population. \n6   ADB. 1999.

Manila.  \n \n ", "2 \nnortheastern region.7 The provinces, however, struggle to capture development opportunities as \nrapid urbanization puts pressure on their limited urban infrastructure and services, resulting in \nincreased  environmental  pollution  and  public  health  risks.  Though  three  provinces  have \naggregated 10% of the national population, their provincial economy only contributes 7% of the \nnational gross domestic product (GDP).8 Agriculture, trading, construction, and services produce \nlimited  revenues.  Climate  change  increases  annual  rainfall  intensity  and  frequency  in  the \nprovinces and the entire Mekong River catchment (795,000 square kilometers), making people\u2019s \nlives and infrastructure more vulnerable to floods. \n \n6.  Access to services. National access to improved water supply in urban areas (excluding \nPhnom Penh) is 69.7%, while access to piped water supply is 42.2%. Wastewater and solid waste \nservices in urban areas (excluding Phnom Penh) are inadequate. While about 80.0% of the \npopulation has access to improved sanitation, a large proportion (69.3%) have individual systems \n(septic tanks) and access to sewerage and wastewater treatment is very limited (10.7%).9 More \nthan 75% of households in Cambodia\u2019s urban areas (excluding Phnom Penh) do not have access \nto solid waste services. Rapid urbanization will worsen these challenges. The main reasons for \nthese service delivery gaps are (i) inadequate coverage and delivery of urban environmental \ninfrastructure and services, (ii) inadequate management of public investments, and (iii) poor urban \nplanning that does not consider environmental management and disaster and climate risks. \n \n7.  Policy  framework.  Cambodia\u2019s  National  Strategic  Development  Plan,  2014\u20132018 \nidentifies key priorities for the urban sector, which include developing a national strategy for town \nand master plans for urban infrastructure; ensuring environmental sustainability; installing solid \nand liquid waste management systems; and further developing laws related to land management, \nurbanization, and construction.10 However, actions for sanitation and solid waste are not well \ndefined. Regarding sanitation, the National Policy on Water Supply and Sanitation (2003) calls \nfor greater private sector participation, improved cost recovery, cross subsidies where needed, \nautonomy of public utilities, and the establishment of a regulatory body.11  \n \n8.  Institutional  arrangements.  The  Ministry  of  Public  Works  and  Transport  (MPWT) \nhandles asset creation for urban sanitation, and the provincial Departments of Public Works and \nTransport (DPWT) handle operation and maintenance (O&M). Solid waste management is the \ntown\u2019s responsibility. Because of limited technical capacity in provinces and municipalities, MPWT \ncontinues to be involved in the construction of large-scale infrastructure such as sewerage \nnetworks, wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), and controlled landfills. \n \n9.  Private sector participation. Private sector participation in urban services has been \nlimited, given the public nature of the assets, limited revenue potential, and limited capacity of the \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2014.

Out of 24 provinces, the \nincome per capita and multidimensional poverty index for five northeastern provinces are Kampong Cham, $1,033 \n(ranked 12th) and 0.239 (ranked 14th); Kratie, $573 (ranked 23rd) and 0.309 (ranked 20th); Mondul Kiri, $418 (ranked \n24th) and 0.409 (ranked 23rd); Ratanak Kiri, $813 (ranked 18th) and 0.409 (ranked 23rd); and Stung Treng $721 \n(ranked 20th) and 0.369 (ranked 21st). \n8   The national GDP per capita in 2017 was $1,447 (projected figure). The national average population growth rate was \n1.46% per annum. Contribution to the national economy and provincial GDP per capita was estimated from the \nprovincial household income from the 2014 socioeconomic survey (footnote 9) and the provincial population data. \n9  Government of Cambodia, Ministry of Planning. 2015.

Solid waste fees are collected from 30% to 50% of the project towns\u2019 populations. \n ", "3 \nprivate sector. Solid waste management can only attract private operators in some towns. \n \n10.  Project-specific constraints.  The project towns experience the following constraints:  \n(i)  Kampong Cham\u2019s population will increase from 47,900 in 2017 to 75,000 in 2040. \nAlthough 87% of the population will have access to piped water supply by 2024, \nthe town sanitation service relies on preliminary onsite treatment (individual soak \npits). Solid waste collection service covers just over 50% of the town\u2019s population \nand waste is disposed at an open dumpsite. Floods result in an estimated annual \neconomic loss of $1.1 million. \n(ii)  Kratie\u2019s population is projected to grow by 3% per year, from 34,700 in 2017 to \n68,200 in 2040. Piped water supply coverage will reach 53% by 2024, but the town \nhas no sewage and drainage service. Solid waste collection by the private operator \ncovers less than 30% of the town\u2019s population. The town is vulnerable to seasonal \nfloods and waterlogging, with an estimated annual economic loss of $0.8 million. \n(iii)  Stung Treng, on the border with the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, has a \npopulation of 32,000 (2017) that will grow to 68,500 (2040). By 2024, water supply \nwill cover 88% of the population. The sanitation service relies on preliminary onsite \ntreatment  without  wastewater  or  drainage  service.  The  town\u2019s  solid  waste \ncollection service covers 35%, with no proper disposal site. It is most vulnerable to \nseasonal floods, with an estimated annual economic loss of $1.3 million.   \n \n11.  Financial management. DPWTs and town governments have institutional weaknesses \nand face limited financial resources and revenue streams. In 2017, the central government \ntransferred funds accounting for 77%\u201397% of the DPWTs\u2019 annual revenue ($1.6 million\u2013$6.3 \nmillion) and 85%\u201397% of the town governments\u2019 annual revenue ($0.4 million\u2013$0.6 million). This \nexpenditure requirement will continue to grow if revenue-generating mechanisms are not set up. \nPaper-based public management systems and lack of a public asset database cause inconsistent \nbookkeeping and opaque transactions. This results in inefficient use of human and financial \nresources for urban services and their O&M. \n \n12.  ADB assistance and lessons learned. Since 1997, ADB has approved $305 million in \nloan and grant projects for urban services in Cambodia.12 Lessons incorporated from the two \nongoing GMS corridor town development projects include (i) concentrating investments on the \nsame sector (i.e. sanitation and flood protection) and same GMS corridor to achieve synergies in \ndevelopment impact, and (ii) fostering cooperation among project provinces and corridor towns  \nby coordinating their provincial five-year strategic development plan. Other lessons from the urban \ndevelopment and water sector projects include (i) ensuring the project finances household \nconnections and onsite plumbing costs, as these are crucial to the operational and financial \nviability of the wastewater system; (ii) providing advisory support for developing a financial \nsustainability road map for all investments; and (iii) adopting a thorough and practical approach \nto land acquisition and resettlement, aligning with the agreed resettlement framework.  \n \n13.  Development coordination. ADB is a lead partner for the urban sector in Cambodia. As \npart of project preparation, it coordinated with development partners in the urban and water \nsector, including Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), the Agence Fran\u00e7aise de \nD\u00e9veloppement, and the World Bank. These partners have focused on larger cities such as \nPhnom Penh and Siem Reap, with some engagements in other towns such as Sihanoukville, \n                                                \n12  ADB. 2014.

The World Bank is planning to \nreengage in the sector through the Small City Water Supply and Sanitation Project. \n \n14.  Strategic context. The project is aligned with Phase III of Cambodia\u2019s Rectangular \nStrategy and the National Strategic Development Plan, 2014\u20132018.13 Aligning with its country \npartnership  strategy,  2014\u20132018,  ADB\u2019s  urban  development  and  water  sector  support  has \nfocused on provinces and towns along the GMS corridors by promoting regional socioeconomic \nintegration. The project is consistent with the two ongoing projects targeting towns on the GMS \nSouthern Corridor and the GMS Southern Coastal Corridor, and other ADB operational and sector \npolicies: ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 and Urban Operational Plan.14   \n  \n15.  ADB\u2019s value addition. ADB\u2019s support to GMS corridor towns is a unique long-term \nengagement to transform the regional transport corridor into an economic corridor. The project \nwill (i) enhance regional cooperation through provincial development strategies, and support \nresilient master planning to address climate and disaster risks, and (ii) pilot the use of ICT to \nenhance efficiency and transparency in public service management. By 2019, ADB will have \nongoing urban and water sector projects in more than 15 of Cambodia\u2019s 26 provincial cities. ADB\u2019s \ngrowing program including this project provides sufficient scale to engage with the government \non strategic and policy issues including town master planning, and financial sustainability road \nmap of urban services which include differentiated approaches based on affordability.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n16.  The project is aligned with the following impact: sustainable, inclusive, equitable, and \nresilient growth achieved (footnote 10). The project will have the following outcome: urban \nservices for enhancing regional economic connectivity in participating towns improved.15 \n \nC.  Outputs  \n \n17.  Output 1: Urban environmental infrastructure improved. The output will include (i) a \nsewerage system comprising a new 5,050 cubic meter per day (m3/day) lagoon-based WWTP \nwith 137 km of pipelines, 4,676 household connections and pump stations, a 4.3 km drainage \nchannel, and a controlled landfill with capacity of 900,000 cubic meters (m3) and waste collection \nvehicles in Kampong Cham;16 (ii) a sewerage system comprising a new 4,900 m3/day lagoon-\nbased WWTP with 143 km of pipelines, 2,688 household connections and pump stations, a 12 \nkm drainage channel, a controlled landfill with capacity of 433,500 m3 and waste collection \nvehicles, and pedestrian walk rehabilitation with energy-efficient streetlights in Kratie; and (iii) a \nsewerage system comprising a new 3,800 m3/day lagoon-based WWTP with 147 km of pipelines, \n2,253 household connections and pump stations, a controlled landfill with capacity of 291,000 m3 \nincluding collection vehicles, pedestrian walk rehabilitation with street landscaping and energy-\nefficient streetlights in Stung Treng. \n \n                                                \n13   Government of Cambodia. 2013. \u201cRectangular Strategy\u201d for Growth, Employment, Equity and Efficiency Phase III. \nPhnom Penh; Government of Cambodia. 2014.

At the policy level, it will \nformulate provincial five-year strategic development plans to enhance regional connectivity and \neconomic integration and resilient town planning that incorporates climate change and disaster \nrisk considerations. At the institutional level, it will develop ICT-based operational and planning \nsupport systems: (i) public management systems including public asset management, and (ii) \nutility billing systems for efficient and transparent government operations. At the operational level, \nit will improve staff capacity in urban service delivery, O&M skills for urban facilities, and contract \nmanagement with private service providers. To attain public support and ensure participatory \nplanning, MPWT will raise public awareness on sanitation and environmental benefits. \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan  \n \n19.

The implementation arrangements are described in the PAM and summarized in Table 3.  \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  December 2018\u2013December 2023 \nEstimated completion date   31 December 2023 \nEstimated loan/grant closing date   30 June 2024 \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body  Secretary of State, MPWT (chair); Ministry of Land Management, Urban \nPlanning and Construction; Ministry of Economy and Finance; Ministry of \nHandicraft and Industry; Ministry of Interior; Ministry of Environment; and \nMinistry of Post and Telecommunications (members) \n(ii)   Executing agency  MPWT \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies  DPWT in Kampong Cham, Kratie, and Stung Treng provinces \n(iv)  Implementation unit  A project management unit (MPWT) and implementing units (DPWTs) \ncomprising technical, safeguards, social, and financial staff. \nProcurementa  International competitive bidding  6 contracts  $73.8 million \nNational competitive bidding  2 contracts  $1.7 million \nConsulting servicesa  Quality- and cost-based selection  541 person-months  $8.6 million \nAdvance contracting  Advance action for consulting service requested.  \nDisbursement  The loan and grant proceeds will be disbursed following ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed \narrangements agreed between the government and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, DPWT = Department of Public Works and Transport, MPWT = Ministry of Public \nWorks and Transport. \na  MPWT\u2019s procurement and recruitment will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2017, as amended from time to \ntime), and ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2017, as amended from time to time).  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n23.  One project management consultant will provide consulting services for the project and \nthe proposed Second Urban Environmental Management in the Tonle Sap Basin Project under a \nsingle contract. The MPWT requested expressions of interest for project management consulting \nservice recruitment on 11 June 2018.18 \n \n                                                \n18 Both projects have a similar scope of work and implementation schedule and are managed by the same project \nmanagement unit (PMU) in the MPWT. Combining the consulting service packages will attract a stronger firm, \nimprove economies of scale, and ensure a strong field presence of key international experts across both projects. \n ", "7 \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n24.  Technical due diligence confirmed that the project is technically viable. ADB and the \nMPWT conducted a detailed examination of (i) the existing infrastructure gaps; (ii) town land use \nplans; (iii) the required treated effluent quality; and (iv) storm water runoff and wastewater and \nsolid  waste  generation  projections.19 ADB  and  the  MPWT  selected  the  project  scope  to \ncomplement the existing investment, and the scope will be fully compatible with local conditions \nand reduce disaster and climate change risk.20 An alternative analysis considered lagoon-based \ntreatment systems and constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment, and controlled dump site, \ncontrolled landfill and a fully engineered sanitary landfill for solid waste. The MPWT selected the \nlagoon-based system and the controlled landfills for all towns based on their capacities to contain \npollution, the O&M budget and technical capacity of local government engineers.21 \n \n25.  The project\u2019s climate risk without mitigation is classified medium. Key climate risks include \nincreased  precipitation  intensity  and  variability.  The  WWTP,  drainage  channel,  and  landfill \ndesigns will factor disaster and climate risk considerations. The project will contribute to the towns\u2019 \nclimate resilience and disaster risk by improving storm water drainage capacities and formulating \nresilient provincial development strategy and towns\u2019 master plans.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n26.  Economic analysis. The project is economically viable. ADB conducted the economic \nanalysis of the proposed investments from 2019 to 2043 in accordance with ADB guidelines. ADB \nquantified the benefits of (i) wastewater and solid waste in terms of health and environmental \nbenefits,  using the disability-adjusted-life-year  approach,  and (ii)  drainage  and  town  center \nenhancement based on the avoidance of flood damage and losses caused by disrupted economic \nactivity during floods. The economic internal rate of return for the three towns is 13.6% for the \nbase case scenario. Sensitivity testing indicated that it decreases to 11.8% in the most sensitive \ncase but is still above the economic opportunity cost of capital of 9.0%.22 \n \n27.  Financial analysis. A financial evaluation of the revenue-generating wastewater system \nand solid waste management in the three towns indicated that the government will be unable to \nachieve full cost recovery through the projected tariff collection. ADB assessed the financial \nsustainability risk rating as substantial and required subsidy or viability gap financing. The analysis \nshowed that realistic tariff schemes will enable DPWTs and town governments to strengthen their \nannual revenue streams and achieve full O&M cost recovery in the medium to long term.23 To \nensure financial sustainability, the government committed to finalize the financial sustainability \n                                                \n19 WWTPs will meet standards for discharge into public water areas and sewers: 80 mg/L biological oxygen demand \nand 100 mg/L chemical oxygen demand (Sub-Decree No. 27 ANRK.BK on Water Pollution Control). \n20 In 2023, the project-supported wastewater service will cover 29%\u201332% of the towns\u2019 population while water supply \nwill cover 53%\u201388% of the towns\u2019 population. The water supply service area covers 100% of the wastewater service \narea. The other projects include (i) water supply network expansions funded by JICA and ADB in Kampong Cham \n(ADB. 2017. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan and \nAdministration of Loan and Grant to Cambodia for the Provincial Water Supply and Sanitation Project. Manila; and \n(ii) the water supply system funded by ADB in Stung Treng (ADB. 2014. Report and Recommendation of the \nPresident to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to Cambodia for the Urban Water Supply Project. Manila). \n21 The three towns\u2019 population densities will be 52\u201375 people per hectare (people/ha) in the town center and                             \n33\u201364 people/ha in the project area (the average population density in Phnom Penh is about 55 people/ha). \n22  Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23  Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nroad map, including incremental wastewater and solid waste tariff and its collection schemes; \nfinancial transfers to cover O&M costs; and financial management, including cross-subsidization \nfrom other public utilities. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n28.  The MPWT and its project management unit (PMU) are administering three ADB-financed \nprojects. All three provincial governments have experience in projects funded by international \nfinancial institutions and bilateral development partners. Kampong Cham and Stung Treng have \nongoing ADB loan projects. Procurement capacity assessments concluded that the MPWT and \nits PMU have strong capacity to undertake procurement in accordance with ADB requirements. \nBuilding on its experience, ADB will support an advanced mode of procurement, including design\u2013\nbuild contracting. Although the three provincial governments and their project implementation \nunits are not expected to handle any ADB procurement, they have adequate capacity to conduct \nnational procurement activities. The financial management risk is moderate due to constrained \nresources for asset and financial management. The government agreed on a time-bound action \nplan to mitigate risks through loan covenants on the timely appropriation of counterpart funds and \nundertaking anticorruption measures. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) \nwas explained to and discussed with the government. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n29.  The project will directly benefit about 17,900 households (7,134 in Kampong Cham, 6,060 \nin Kratie, and 4,706 in Stung Treng), including about 2,136 poor and near-poor households. The \nproject is classified general intervention. It will improve the quality of life of the people in three \ntowns by ensuring affordable access and urban services delivery. Environmental sanitation and \nflood protection, and job opportunities for operating the facilities, will particularly benefit poor \nhouseholds and households headed by women. The social inclusion design features include (i) \nprovision of free-of-charge wastewater connections and subsidy to the poor and households \nheaded by women; and (ii) pilot projects on community-based pre- and post-flood management.  \n \n30.  The project is classified effective gender mainstreaming. A gender assessment identified \nlimited participation in the provincial strategy and decision-making process for planning, low \nfemale staff representation in the sanitation sector, and limited job opportunities. Impact and \nservice  disruptions  related  to  climate  change  directly  affect  women,  as  they  have  primary \nresponsibility for the household and community management such as cleanup activities during \nand post-flood events. Poor sewerage and drainage heighten risks and flooding impacts, such as \nthe disruption of work and livelihoods resulting in loss of income, proportionately higher loss of \nassets and property, and an increased risk of communicable diseases. The gender action plan \nincludes (i) strategies to increase women\u2019s representation in provincial strategic decision-making, \n(ii) targets for women\u2019s participation in PMUs and capacity-building training sessions, and (iii) \nprovision of job opportunities. The government will collect gender-disaggregated data to monitor \nprogress against the gender action plan. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n31.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.24   \n                                                \n24 ADB. Safeguard Categories. https://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/safeguard-categories. \n ", "9 \n32.  Environment (category B). The MPWT prepared an initial environmental examination \nand environmental management plan (EMP) based on the preliminary design, and disclosed the \ninitial environmental examination and EMP on the ADB website on 23 May 2018.25 Public and \nstakeholder consultations informed the project design and will continue during implementation. \nThe EMPs detail mitigation and monitoring measures, budget for implementation and institutional \narrangements. MPWT will implement the EMP with the support of consulting services and a full-\ntime PMU environmental safeguard officer.  \n \n33.  A  project  grievance  redress  mechanism  will  facilitate  the  resolution  of  safeguard \ncomplaints. ADB and the MPWT selected subproject sites. The construction of WWTPs and \ncontrolled landfills, improved drainage, and closure of existing dumpsites will have net positive \nenvironmental and health benefits through reduced pollution and floods. This will be particularly \nbeneficial in Stung Treng and Kratie, which support internationally important riverine habitats. \nDuring construction, short-term, localized impacts will occur such as noise, dust, traffic, waste \ngeneration, and surface water quality deterioration. During facility operation, effluent discharges \nand landfill leachate will need careful management. These impacts will be prevented or minimized \nto an acceptable degree through effective EMP implementation, effective O&M, and capacity \nbuilding. \n \n34.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). The project will acquire 15.3 hectares (ha) of \nagricultural land. This will affect 12 households with 48 persons, of which 11 households will be \nseverely affected\u2014three in Kratie and eight in Stung Treng. The MPWT prepared two draft \nresettlement plans for Kratie and Stung Treng following ADB\u2019s Safeguards Policy Statement and \nCambodian laws and regulations.26 The MPWT has prepared a resettlement framework to guide \nthe screening and resettlement planning in case impacts arise from the detailed engineering \ndesign or during implementation. The MPWT will submit resettlement plans to ADB for review and \napproval before awarding any contracts and will implement them before construction starts. The \nMPWT disclosed the resettlement framework and the resettlement plans on the ADB website on \n23 May 2018. \n \n35.  The Ministry of Economy and Finance\u2019s General Department of Resettlement (GDR) has \nthe experience and capacity to manage involuntary resettlement impact. The GDR will: (i) conduct \ntraining on ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement to build the capacity of relevant stakeholders; (ii) \nensure that any physically or economically affected persons are compensated at full replacement \ncost before civil works begin; and (iii) establish an effective, gender-inclusive grievance redress \nmechanism to receive, record, and facilitate the resolution of communities\u2019 concerns over project \nimpacts, with attention to vulnerable people. The PMU will have dedicated full-time staff to support \ncompliance with ADB safeguard requirements. The GDR will update the draft resettlement plans \nbased on detailed design and in accordance with the resettlement framework and will implement \nthem before civil works begin. \n \n36.  Indigenous peoples (category C). No indigenous peoples communities are in the project \narea of impact. Cham and other ethnic minorities in the three towns are settled in upland villages, \nfar from town centers where construction will take place. The project will not directly or indirectly \naffect the dignity, human rights, livelihood systems, or culture of indigenous peoples or ethnic \nminorities; and will not affect the territories or natural or cultural resources that indigenous peoples \nown, use, occupy, or claim as their ancestral domain. \n                                                \n25 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26 Resettlement Framework; Resettlement Plan: Kratie; and Resettlement Plan: Stung Treng (accessible from the list \nof linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \n \nF.
