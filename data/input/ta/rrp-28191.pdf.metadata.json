The  capacity\nbuilding components of the Project will build the capability\nof the Executing Agency, Electricit\u00e9 du Cambodge (EDC) to\nprovide an efficient service to its customers, and create a\ncreditworthy utility attractive to private investors.\nClassification Primary Objective:  Economic Growth\nEnvironmental Assessment Environmental  Category  B:  An  initial  environmental\nexamination  was  undertaken;  the  summary  is  a  core\nappendix.\nRationale The Project forms part of the Asian Development Bank\u2019s\n(ADB) strategy to support the Government\u2019s objective to\nreduce  poverty,  which  predominates  in  semi-urban  and\nrural  areas.  Rural  development  is  correlated  with  the\nabsorptive capacity of urban economies for increased rural\nproduce.  Economic  growth  in  the  provincial  towns  is\nconstrained  by  inadequate  and  high-priced  electricity\nsystems. The Project will reduce one of those constraints in\nselected  areas  and  spur  investment  in  more  productive\ncapacity in small and medium-size enterprises. While there\nare a number of private electricity suppliers in the country,\nthey are of an extremely low caliber, very small scale, and\nuse second-hand equipment. Without external intervention,\nthe needed improvements in electricity supply are unlikely\nto materialize.\nObjectives and Scope The objectives are to (i) expand the availability of reliable\npower supplies in eight provincial towns at an average tariff\nlower than that presently being charged; (ii) build capacity\nby  creating  suitable  management,  operation,  and\nmaintenance organizations in the provincial centers so the\nnew  systems  are  efficient  and  financially  viable,  and\ntherefore attractive to private investors for future expansion;\n(iii) strengthen the skills in EDC\u2019s head office (which will\nremain responsible for about 90 percent of EDC sales);\n(iv) improve  the  training  available  at  EDC's  ADB-funded\nTraining Center in Phnom Penh; and (v) gather data on\nwhich to base future hydropower development.", "iii\nThe Project has two components.\nPart A, Infrastructure. Replacement and extension of the\nelectricity distribution systems in eight provincial towns; in\nfive  of  these,  new  diesel generators  will  be  provided  to\nmeet forecast demand up to the end of 2006. Two other\ntowns  will  be  connected  to  existing  or  proposed\ntransmission lines.\nPart B, Capacity Building. The capacity building component\nwill (i) establish and make operational, through provision of\nequipment and training, the organizations that will operate\nand  manage  the  provincial  power  systems,  initially\nbranches of EDC; and (ii) strengthen the capability of the\nEDC  head  office  by  providing  training  in  financial\nmanagement  and  contract  preparation  for  private  sector\nparticipation; and providing trainers and facilities for EDC\u2019s\ntraining center in Phnom Penh, and for the Hydropower\nDepartment of the Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy\n(MIME).\nCost Estimates The Project is estimated to cost $24.2 million equivalent,\ncomprising  foreign  exchange  costs  of  $12.1  million  and\nlocal currency costs of $12.1 million equivalent.\nFinancing Plan The proposed ADB loan of up to $18.6 million equivalent\nwill finance 77 percent of the total project cost including\n$6.5  million  equivalent  of  the  local  currency  cost.  The\nGovernment is seeking parallel cofinancing from Agence\nFrancaise de Developpement (AFD) of about $2.5 million\non  a  grant  basis  to  cover  $1.7  million  of  the  foreign\nexchange cost plus $0.8 million equivalent of local currency\ncosts.

Each\ncontract for supply of goods and services and civil works\ncontracts  estimated  to  cost  more  than  $500,000  and\n$1 million equivalent respectively will be awarded on the\nbasis  of  international  competitive  bidding.  A  turnkey\ncontract will be used to procure the diesel generating sets,\nand a supply of goods and related services contract will be\nused for the distribution systems.\nConsulting Services Consultants will be recruited and supervised by EDC in\naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of\nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for\nthe engagement of domestic consultants. The consultants\nwill be required to design the facilities in the selected towns,\nassist with tender evaluation, supervise construction, and\nassist with planning and monitoring of the capacity building\ncomponents of the Project. A total of 23 person-months of\ninternational and 25 person-months of domestic consultants\nwill be required.\nEstimated Project 30 June 2004.\nCompletion Date\nProject Benefits Over 100,000 persons in 21,000 households will receive a\nand Beneficiaries much improved electricity service. In addition, from 2004-\n2010,  about  70,000  persons  in  13,000  households  will\nreceive  a  power  supply  for  the  first  time.  The  average\nplanned tariff three years after project commissioning will\nbe about 24 percent lower than the existing average tariff.\nAbout 30 percent of the direct beneficiaries are living below\nthe poverty line (according to the Cambodian definition),\nwhich is about the same proportion as in the population\nnationally. Over 100 staff will be recruited and trained in\nEnglish, computing, and financial and management skills;\nand employed to operate the new systems. In addition to\nthe direct beneficiaries, the rural population surrounding the\nproject towns will benefit by having access to a growing\nmarket for their produce. The estimated economic internal\nrate  of  return  for  the  Project  is  17.8  percent  and  the\nfinancial rate of return is 4.2 percent.", "v", "I. THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed\nloan to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Provincial Power Supply Project.\nII. INTRODUCTION\n2. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) recommenced lending to Cambodia in 1992, and\ninitially focused on the provision of emergency generating and distribution facilities in Phnom\nPenh.1 This was followed by rehabilitation of the electricity systems in Phnom Penh and the two\nimportant provincial towns of Sihanoukville and Siem Reap.2 The Project will (i) expand and\nreplace  the  inadequate  electricity  generation  and  distribution  systems  in  eight  additional\nprovincial capital towns, thereby removing a constraint on economic growth in the towns and\nrural hinterlands; and (ii) build the capacity of the Executing Agency, Electricit\u00e9 du Cambodge\n(EDC), to provide efficient service to its customers. The Project is included in ADB\u2019s lending\nprogram  for  2000  and  was  prepared  under  ADB  technical  assistance  (TA)3  completed  in\nApril 1998. Due to changes in political and economic circumstances in 1997 and 1998, the study\nfindings were updated under a small-scale TA.4 Loan appraisal5 was carried out from 20 July to\n4 August 2000. This report is based on the findings of the TA reports and information provided\nby the Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy (MIME) and EDC. The project framework is given\nin Appendix 1.\nIII. BACKGROUND\nA. Sector Description\n1.  The Energy Sector\n3. Cambodia is a predominately rural society emerging from a long period of conflict. With\nrenewed stability and steady progress on reforms to gain the confidence of international aid\nagencies,  public  investment  should  be  sustained  at  levels  sufficient  to  stimulate  annual\neconomic growth of about 6.0\u20137.0 percent, which with population growth of about 2.5 percent,\ntranslates into 3.5\u20134.5 percent per capita income growth. Agricultural productivity should begin\nto rise with priority public investments in rural infrastructure, and growth in tourism can be\nexpected in selected areas. The greatest uncertainty pertains to the level of industrial growth,\nwhich depends largely on foreign investment. Gross value added in industry has grown robustly\nin the last three years (averaging 13.5 percent per year) but may slow in the short term as\ngarment quotas take hold. In the provincial towns, as agricultural productivity and per capita\nincomes  rise,  demand  for  electricity  from  residential  customers  and  small  enterprises  will\nsteadily increase.\n                                                          \n1 Loan 1199-CAM(SF):  Special Rehabilitation Assistance Project, for $67.7 million, approved on 26 November 1992.\n2 Loan 1345-CAM(SF):  Power Rehabilitation Project, for $28.2 million, approved on 15 December 1994.\n3 TA 2629-CAM:  Power Rehabilitation II Project, for $450,000, approved on 20 August 1996.\n4 TA  3256-CAM:  Update of Power Rehabilitation II Project Preparation Study,  for  $150,000,  approved  on\n17 September 1999.\n5 The Appraisal Mission comprised M. Bristol, Project Engineer and Mission Leader; C.S. Chung, Environmental\nSpecialist; E. Fischer, Counsel; S.H. Kho, Financial Analyst; J. Kuiper, Senior Project Economist; I. Simbolon,\nSocial Development Specialist; and P. Cordukes, Financial Analyst/Consultant.", "2\n4. The  country  has  two  indigenous  sources  of  energy,  i.e.,  biomass,  which  provides\n85 percent  of  the  present  energy  consumption,  and  hydropower,  which  has  hardly  been\ndeveloped. There is a 1 megawatt (MW) hydropower plant serving Banlung, the capital of\nRattanakiri Province, and a dam at Kirirom, which is all that remains serviceable of an 11 MW\nhydropower project located about 120 kilometers (km) west of Phnom Penh. The balance of\nenergy demand is supplied by imported petroleum products.6 The consumption of primary\nenergy  for  domestic  and  light  industry,  transport,  and  electricity  production  is  87  percent,\n9 percent, and 4 percent.\n5. Imports of petroleum products in 1999 were valued at approximately $150 million or\n16 percent of total imports. This makes petroleum products the single largest import by value.\nFor  the  first  quarter  of  2000,  petroleum  product  imports  were  estimated  at  $45  million,\n27 percent higher than the first quarter of 1999 and 19 percent of total imports. Clearly, rising oil\nprices are increasing the burden of energy costs on the economy. However, this is not likely to\npresent a serious balance of payments problem in the foreseeable future. Even as oil prices\nwere  increasing,  international  reserves  have  been  rising  in  2000,  and  are  currently  over\n$450 million  or  about  3.5  months  of  imports.  Moreover,  the  Government  has  had  a  quite\nconservative macroeconomic policy over the last few years. The International Monetary Fund is\nwatching  the  balance  of  payments  position  closely  and  is  sufficiently  satisfied  with  its\nmanagement by Government to have recently released the second tranche of the facility under\na Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility program.\n6. The major energy source nationwide is fuelwood, which is used for cooking by most of\nthe  population,  and  almost  exclusively  by  the  rural  population.  Kerosene  is  used  by\nnonelectrified households for lighting, mainly in the countryside, and cooking in urban areas.\nThe number of liquefied petroleum gas stoves is believed to be increasing in Phnom Penh, but\nthe cost of gas cylinders and new stoves is an impediment to widespread proliferation of this\nrelatively clean fuel. Liquefied petroleum gas represents only about 0.2 percent of national\nenergy requirements.\n2.  The Electricity Subsector\na.  General Structure\n7. The electricity sector, never more than rudimentary, and completely destroyed by 20\nyears  of  war,  is  making  progress  on  the  path  to  normality.  However,  the  obstacles  are\nformidable. Responsibility for coordination of electricity sector policy and planning rests with the\nEnergy  General  Directorate  of  MIME.  Three  of  the  Energy  Departments  have  direct\nresponsibility  for  electricity  sector  planning,  i.e.,  the  Hydropower,  Solar  Photovoltaics,  and\nProvincial Electricity departments. The latter formerly had operational responsibility for provision\nof electricity in 17 provinces.\n8. Until recently, MIME has not had the resources to carry out its responsibilities to provide\nan adequate electricity supply, with the result that its small (usually less than 200 kilowatt [kW]\ngenerating  units)  are  often  inoperable  because  of  lack  of  spares.  Also  the  mismatched\ndistribution  components  are  overloaded,  and  fuel  is  not  always  available  due  to  payment\narrears. Private systems, which have grown on an ad hoc basis in many of the provincial towns,\n                                                          \n6 Cambodia has no known reserves of oil in spite of concerted exploration efforts. One company has a concession to\ndrill, at greater depths, areas already unsuccessfully explored, and gas, in undetermined quantities, has recently\nbeen discovered.", "3\nsuffer  the  same  problems  as  those  in  public  ownership.  As  there  are  no  administrative\nrestrictions for the private sector to participate in the supply of provincial power, entrepreneurs\nwho could provide a good quality of service are obviously not attracted to participate under the\npresent  circumstances.  Reasons  for  this  include  (i)  the  present  distribution  systems  are\noverloaded so considerable investment is required to serve new customers, (ii) no transparent\ntariff setting mechanism exists, and (iii) skilled operating staff are not available.\n9. Cambodia has no national grid system; electricity supplies that do exist are provided\neither by self-generation or small isolated systems. The sector can be divided into two parts:\n(i) Phnom Penh and seven towns supplied by EDC, and (ii) the remainder of the country.\nb.  The EDC Service Area\n10. As a result of dialogue with ADB and other development agencies, EDC was established\nby Royal Decree in March 1996, as a limited liability company owned jointly by MIME and\nMinistry of Economy and Finance (MEF). EDC has its own board of directors and operates with\nconsiderable independence except in the field of tariff setting. Its charter empowers EDC to\nprovide a nonexclusive, full electricity service for the whole country. Until recently, EDC only\noperated the isolated systems in Phnom Penh, and the urban areas of Kandal, Kompong Cham,\nSiem  Reap,  and  Sihanoukville  but  during  2000,  it  took  over  the  operation  of  Takeo  and\nBattambang  and  EDC  intends  to  gradually  fulfill  its  charter  obligations.  Meanwhile,  MIME\ncontinues to be responsible for all other areas. EDC\u2019s organizational structure is given in\nAppendix 2.\n11. EDC\u2019s largest system is in Phnom Penh, which has a population of about 1 million\npersons  in  168,000  households,  of  which  about  85,000  (51  percent)  have  an  electricity\nconnection. The system in Phnom Penh has a peak demand of 64 MW and a generating\ncapacity of 90 MW, of which 35 MW is provided by a private power producer (PPP). A contract\nwith a second PPP was signed in 1996 under which 60 MW of additional capacity for the capital\nwas scheduled to come online at the end of 1998. After several delays, the World Bank group\u2019s\nInternational Finance Corporation withdrew its support for the Project in mid-2000; and it is now\ndoubtful if the Project will proceed. Therefore, EDC has recently entered into a short-term\ncontract with a second PPP for 15 MW of diesel-fired generating capacity as an interim measure\nto  meet  Phnom  Penh\u2019s  demand  and  provide  sufficient  reserve  capacity.  Siem  Reap  and\nSihanoukville  have  about  3  MW  and  8  MW  respectively,  of  operational  diesel  generating\ncapacity, and the other areas served by EDC have a total capacity of about 6 MW.\n12. Partly, as a result of ADB loans and TA, the systems in Phnom Penh and the four other\ntowns controlled by EDC since its independence are well managed, and customers receive a\nmuch improved standard of service at an average tariff about 40 percent below those in most\nprovincial centers. Factors contributing to the improved performance are  (i) salaries have risen\nwith the result that qualified staff can be recruited and retained; (ii) tariffs were raised by\n40 percent in 1999 (although this was not sufficient to produce a positive operating income);\n(iii) sales growth has been strong, at least until the 1999 tariff increase; (iv) accounts are being\nindependently audited; and (v) EDC has recently been successful in breaking an electricity-\nstealing racket that involved senior EDC staff.\n13. However,  EDC\u2019s  financial  situation  remains  precarious  for  reasons  that  are  largely\noutside its control. For instance, its loads are small, and can only reasonably be served by", "4\ndiesel generating units that are inherently expensive to operate.7 With no economies of scale,\nand with the necessity of maintaining a distribution system to serve a largely domestic market,\nEDC\u2019s average cost of supply is higher than the cost of self-generation by large and medium-\nsize enterprises. The tariff structure provides a cross-subsidy to the domestic sector from the\ncommercial and industrial sector with the result that many of EDC\u2019s best potential customers\nhave turned to self generation (although the extent of the cross-subsidy has been reduced in the\ncurrent schedule of tariffs). Fifty percent of EDC\u2019s costs relate to fuel, either directly or as a\npass-through item by its PPP suppliers. The Government, which sets tariffs, has not allowed\ntariffs to increase sufficiently to keep pace with rising fuel prices. The world price of crude oil\naveraged about $13 per barrel in 1998, increased to an average of $18 per barrel in 1999, and\nhas now increased to over $30 per barrel. In Phnom Penh and Sihanoukville, franchise areas\nformerly held by wholesalers8 have now been largely assumed by EDC, so that retail consumers\nnow pay for their consumption at EDC\u2019s scheduled rates. The number of EDC\u2019s customers in\nPhnom Penh has increased from 21,000 in 1997 to 85,000 in 1999 due largely to its takeover of\nwholesalers.  EDC  has  not  been  able  to  adequately  provide  meters  for  all  of  these  new\ncustomers or to include them in its billing system, thus contributing to its nontechnical losses.\nWith  the  help  of  TA  from  Agence  Francaise  de  Developpement  (AFD)  of  France,  these\nproblems are currently being tackled.\nc. Outside EDC\u2019s Service Area\n14. No public electricity system exists for most of the country. Wealthy households have\ntheir own generators, and some households avail of battery charging services, from which\nenergy costs up to KR3,800 ($1) per kilowatt-hour (kWh). Most provincial capitals have a central\nelectricity system but all are inadequate in terms of capacity, safety, level of service, and cost.\nThe distribution systems, which generally cover only the central parts of the provincial towns,\nwhose populations range from 10,000 to 100,000, are mainly owned and operated by MIME,\nwhich either generates power or purchases power from private operators. Private operators with\ncapacity greater than 125 kilovolt-ampere (kVA) are required to be licensed by MIME, which has\noffices in each provincial capital. The total generating capacity nationwide in the provincial\ntowns (other than those operated by EDC) is about 10 MW. Some towns have more than one\nprivate generator, some of which also have a small, low voltage distribution system for up to a\nfew hundred households. In the provincial towns, tariffs are controlled by an arrangement\nbetween MIME and the provincial governments. In each town, a single tariff is generally applied\nto all consumers, ranging typically between KR960 ($0.25) per kWh and KR1,350 ($0.35) per\nkWh, with tariffs for some private power supplies up to KR1,600 ($0.41) per kWh. Losses in the\nprovincial  towns  are  typically  35  to  50  percent  of  units  generated.  These  figures  include\nnonpayment for consumption by local influential people, and are probably not sensitive to\nchanges in electricity price. In spite of their present high tariffs, private producers have suffered\nfrom  rising  fuel  prices,  and  where  further  tariff  increases  have  been  disallowed  by  the\nauthorities, a number of operators have ceased production.\n                                                          \n7 The larger units are fueled by heavy fuel oil, which is cheaper than diesel but requires more out-of-service time for\nmaintenance, and is more polluting.\n8 In 1995, wholesalers were allowed to buy electricity from EDC at KR300 ($0.077) per kWh and sell to consumers\nat KR350 ($0.091) per kWh. However, these wholesalers tended to charge residential consumers between KR400\n($0.103) per kWh to KR800 ($0.208) per kWh as there was no control. In 1999, EDC started taking over the\nwholesalers and at present there are only about 20 wholesalers in Phnom Penh. It is envisaged that the franchises\nof the remaining wholesalers will be taken over by EDC by early 2001.", "5\nB.  Government Policies and Plans\n1.  Scope\n15. In  October  1994,  Cambodia  formulated  an  energy  sector  development  policy  with\nobjectives to (i) provide an adequate supply of energy throughout Cambodia at reasonable and\naffordable  prices,  (ii)  ensure  a  reliable,  secure  electricity  supply  at  prices  that  facilitate\ninvestment  in  Cambodia  and  develop  the  national  economy,  (iii) encourage  exploration  of\nindigenous energy resources leading to environmentally and socially acceptable development of\nresources needed to supply all sectors of the Cambodian economy, and (iv) encourage efficient\nuse of energy and minimize detrimental environmental effects resulting from energy supply and\nuse. To implement the policy as it relates to the power sector, in January 1999, the Government\npublished its Power Sector Strategy for the period up to 2016. The strategy is described under\nthe headings of generation and transmission, private sector participation, regulatory framework,\ncommercialization,  provincial  and  rural  electrification,  and  the  environment.  As  such,  it\nrepresents a road map of how to achieve the sector objectives. However, the strategy does not\nmention the constraints that must be addressed in other areas if the objectives are to be\nachieved, such as governance and a weak legal and judicial system.\n2.  Generation and Transmission\n16. In terms of infrastructure, the goal of the policy is to construct a high-voltage grid in the\narea west of Phnom Penh and Tonle Sap, connecting to Viet Nam in the south and Thailand in\nthe  northwest.  The  grid  would  connect  the  main  towns  in  the  area,  including  the  port  of\nSihanoukville and the tourist center of Siem Reap, and also future hydropower projects on the\nBattambang River and Stung Metoek. The remaining 60 percent of the country would be served\nby isolated grids of medium voltage, since load demands will be too low, and distances too\ngreat for economical interconnection for at least the next decade.\n17. In the early years, supply of power will be achieved by a move away from dependence\non imported fuel to importation of cheaper power from Viet Nam and Thailand, and as demand\ngrows, by construction of a combined-cycle thermal plant located at Sihanoukville fueled by\nindigenous or imported natural gas. Funding for feasibility studies for the first phases of the\ngeneration and transmission expansion plans has been secured, and studies commenced.\n18. Included  in  the  Government\u2019s  energy  sector  policy  is  development  of  the\ncountry\u2019s hydropower potential, in the mini (less than 5 MW), small (less than 50 MW), and\nmedium (50-200 MW) power ranges. A constraint to development of the hydropower potential is\nthe lack of adequate hydrological data. At present, very few river flow gauges in the country\nfunction, and previous records have been almost entirely lost. A modest network of gauges\nstrategically placed on rivers throughout the country is essential to provide the necessary\ndatabase for the study of hydropower potential. The Project will address this shortcoming.\n3.  Private Sector Participation in Power Projects\n19. Recent Government involvement in the sector was dictated by the desperate situation of\nthe Cambodian electricity system in 1993. Because the Government could not afford the power\nsupply  infrastructure  required  to  meet  even  the  most  urgent  needs  of  the  country,  the\nGovernment  accepted  proposals  from  investors  who  approached  with  turnkey  projects.\nAccordingly, four power purchase agreements (PPAs) were negotiated to meet the country\u2019s\nurgent power demand, although only two projects have been brought to commercial operation,", "6\ni.e., 35 MW in Phnom Penh in 1996 and 2 MW in Kompong Cham in 1996. Since 1998, the\ninvestment climate has improved in a number of ways, e.g., security has improved; laws have\nbeen  promulgated  in  many  fields,  especially  regarding  investments;  and  the  democratic\nframework is stronger. At the international level, major positive signals have been delivered\nsuch as the award of most favored trading nation status to the Kingdom by the United States\nand admission to the Association of South East Asian Nations. At the provincial level, the\nProject\u2019s capacity building components will improve the market environment in the provinces so\nthat private investors will be attracted to provide future system expansion.\n20. Under the energy sector policy, the Government will follow a new approach for the\ndevelopment and approval of private investment projects in the power sector, including (i) use of\na  transparent  process  to  select  independent  power  producer  (IPP)  developers,  using\ncompetitive tendering procedures for all significant power projects; (ii) use of a termination\nclause in PPAs for possible transfer of assets to EDC provided the utility is able to provide\nsupply at lower cost through the national grid, when it is established; (iii) introduction of a two-\npart tariff for the purchase of electricity from IPPs; and (iv) evaluation of all private sector\nfunding and ownership of significant power projects against public funding and ownership, and\njoint ventures between the public and private sector. Contrary to the energy sector policy, both\nthe  rehabilitation  of  the  Kirirom  Hydropower  Project  and  a  small  franchise  to  import  and\ndistribute power in the province of Koh Kong were awarded by direct negotiation. Guidelines on\nprivate investment and procedures for negotiating PPAs are the subject of policy dialogue with\nADB and other development partners. ADB agrees with the Government that no economies\nwould be gained by restructuring and privatizing EDC at the present time since its systems are\nso small (90 MW in Phnom Penh and a total of 17 MW elsewhere).\n4.  Regulatory Framework\n21. Through  Royal  Decree  in  March  1996,  the  Government  announced  a  decision  to\nestablish an independent regulatory agency to improve the efficiency and availability of electric\npower services in Cambodia by increasing private ownership and competition in electric power\ngeneration.  MIME,  supported  by  World  Bank  assistance,  drafted  an  electricity  law  that  is\ncurrently  being  considered  by  the  National  Assembly.9  The  law  will  create  the  electricity\nauthority of Cambodia (EAC) as an independent regulatory authority and also establish the\nprinciples on which all operators will be licensed to undertake various activities in the electric\npower industry. The law will provide the basis for the regulation of supply of electric power\nservices to the extent such services are monopolistic, and the basis for the protection of the\nrights  of  consumers.  From  the  time  of  enactment  of  the  electricity  law,  the  EAC  will  be\nresponsible for approving all tariffs and charges for the supply of electricity. The EAC will\nregularly review the tariffs and charges to ensure an electricity supply at reasonable prices\nconsistent with providing an adequate return to investors. The EAC will be responsible for\nregulation of both private and public suppliers of electricity, including EDC.\n5.  Commercialization\n22. EDC was converted to a limited liability company in 1996 with equal ownership by MIME\nand MEF. With an independent board of directors, EDC has widespread powers in many areas\nexcept  tariff  setting.  After  passage  of  the  electricity  law,  MIME  will  divest  itself  of  direct\ninvolvement in the provincial power systems, and become the sector policymaker. The optimal\n                                                          \n9 The remaining stages are ratification by the Senate, adoption by the Council of Constitution, and promulgation by\nthe King.", "7\nreplacement structure to own and operate the provincial systems is being investigated under\nTA 3453.10\n6.  Provincial and Rural Electrification\n23. Efforts have concentrated on bringing the electricity supply up to a reasonable standard\nin the capital and two important commercial towns. To a large extent, this has been achieved,\nand the Government has a program to rehabilitate the electricity systems in the remaining\nprovincial capitals. Approximately, $90 million will be required in the medium term to rehabilitate\nthe remaining provincial capitals. The Government plans to seek concessional funds and private\nsector participation, including public-private partnerships. Rehabilitation of the provincial power\nsystems is essential for the proper functioning of local government, and to stimulate the local\neconomies with positive impacts on the urban poor and the rural hinterland, thereby slowing the\nmigration of people to Phnom Penh.\n24. The Government also has a strategy for rural electrification for which $10 million per\nyear for 10 years has been estimated as the minimum capital requirement. Although stand-\nalone systems, particularly renewable generation such as microhydro, may be options in some\nlocations,  generally  the  most  viable  method  will  be  grid  extensions  either  from  suitable\nsubstations  close  to  the  border  in  neighboring  countries,  or  from  the  grids  in  the  newly\nrehabilitated provincial towns. The World Bank is currently providing TA to prepare a staged\nrural  electrification  strategy  and  a  10-year  program  to  increase  electricity  access  to  rural\ncommunities. Preliminary findings indicate that grid extension from provincial towns will prove\ncompetitive compared with new generation facilities. The Project will therefore be a catalyst for\nelectrification of the surrounding rural areas.\n7.  Environmental Policy and Legislation in Cambodia\n25. The Environmental Protection and Natural Resources Management Law, 1996, provides\nfor all projects to be subject to an environmental examination. The law provides for the Ministry\nof Environment to establish an environmental steering committee and project review teams for\ndifferent  sectors.  MIME  and  EDC  participate  in  both  the  steering  committee  and  also  the\nrelevant review team. Government policy provides for sound environmental management of\npower projects through a systematic approach to protection against pollution of air, soil, and\nwater; protection against noise, vibration, and radiation; and protection of flora and fauna in\nrelation  to  power  sector  operations.  As  a  result  of  ADB  TA  2723,11  a  subdecree  on\nenvironmental  impact  assessment  was  approved  by  the  Government  in  August  1999.\nGuidelines for environmental impact assessments for thermal power and transmission projects\nwere also drawn up. The environmental requirements will be integrated into the development of\nall power projects.\n8.  Policy Implementation\n26. The Government through MIME has taken two significant steps that demonstrate its\ncommitment to the policy, i.e., corporatization of EDC and substantial progress towards passing\nthe electricity law. Expansion of the electricity system is following the proposed strategy in terms\n                                                          \n10TA 3453-CAM:  Development of a Strategy for Management of Provincial Power Supplies, for $150,000, approved\non 8 June 2000.\n11 TA 2723-CAM: Institutional Strengthening and Expanding Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Capacity, for\n$1,000,000, approved on 19 December 1996.", "8\nof studying the feasibility of a high-voltage transmission system in parts of the country and\nseeking  funding  for  provincial  and  rural  electrification.  The  Government  has  accepted\nparticipation of the private sector in generation (IPPs in Phnom Penh); transmission (115 kilovolt\n[kV] line from Kirirom Hydropower Project to Phnom Penh); and distribution (22 kV and low-\nvoltage systems in Koh Kong Province and Poipet town). However, none of these contracts has\nbeen awarded on the basis of competition. The electricity law will require contracts to be\nawarded as a result of competitive bidding.\nC.  External Assistance to the Sector\n1.  Loan Assistance\n27. The  international  community  recommenced  assistance  to  Cambodia  in  1992  with\nemergency aid to the power sector from the governments of Australia, Austria, Belgium, France,\nIreland, Japan, Sweden, and the United States. Additional assistance came from the United\nNations Development Programme (UNDP) and World Bank. ADB\u2019s first assistance to the sector\nwas delivered as a component (completed in 1995) of an emergency relief loan used in Phnom\nPenh to rehabilitate a number of diesel generators totaling 8.4 MW that were inoperable due to\nlack of spare parts, to provide 18 MW of new plant and reequip 18 substations. Also under an\nemergency assistance program, UNDP and World Bank implemented a multifaceted project that\nincluded management support, human resource training, and development of regulatory and\nhuman  resource  investment  programs.  Other  power  infrastructure  rehabilitation  included\nrefurbishment  of  medium-voltage  substations  and  connections  between  the  power  stations\nwithin  Phnom  Penh  to  increase  the  reliability  of  supplies.  Subsequent  to  the  emergency\nprogram, the thrust of ADB loan 1345 (footnote 2) and other development partners12 is to bring\nthe distribution system in Phnom Penh up to a reasonable standard to reduce losses, meet\nincreasing demand, attract private sector generators, and improve the reliability of supply. When\nthe  ongoing  transmission-ring  project  around  Phnom  Penh  is  completed  in  2000,  these\nobjectives will largely have been achieved for the central part of the city. A distribution system\nexpansion project, financed by Japan, will be implemented during 2000-2001 covering outlying\nareas of Phnom Penh to bring a grid supply to a further 270,000 people. If only 50 percent of\nhouseholds initially avail of a supply, this would represent an increase in EDC\u2019s customer base\nof 20 percent. ADB assistance under loan 1345 (footnote 2) also provided 5.4 MW of generating\ncapacity to Sihanoukville, and rehabilitated the distribution systems there and in Siem Reap,\nwhere the above objectives were also largely achieved. The loan also supported construction\nand equipping of a training center for EDC in Phnom Penh.\n28. ADB loan 1345 extended by 12 months the services of three international management\nadvisers to EDC, originally funded by UNDP. In 1996, these consultants were instrumental in\nsetting up the planning, finance, and projects departments of EDC and assisting in the crucial\nstages of sector restructuring, which culminated in converting EDC to an autonomous public\nutility in 1996. Also computers and software were provided together with training for accountants\nin their use. In 1999 and 2000, loan proceeds were used to update the software, expand the\nhardware in EDC\u2019s provincial centers, and train EDC staff in international accounting standards.\nThis resulted in EDC producing, for the first time since its corporatization, audited financial\nstatements for 1998. However, EDC\u2019s financial management and forecasting skills remain weak\nand additional assistance is required. Details of major aid assistance are given in Appendix 3.\n                                                          \n12Primarily World Bank, Japan Bank for International Cooperation, and France.", "9\n2.  Technical Assistance\n29. The  focus  of  ADB\u2019s  TA  has  been  human  resource  development  and  training.  In\nparticular,  TA  224313  determined  training  requirements  and  prepared  appropriate  training\nprograms for EDC staff. MIME has benefited from the services of an energy policy adviser for\n18 months, funded by the World Bank; simultaneously, a project management adviser to the\ngeneral manager was assigned to EDC, funded at first by UNDP and subsequently by ADB.\nMore recently, considerable TA has been provided to MIME primarily by the World Bank to\nassist with drafting of the electricity law.\n30. An advisory TA14 designed to investigate ADB\u2019s future role and involvement in the sector\ncommenced in March 2000. It will identify the capacity building and investment needs of the\nsector over the medium term, and develop a financing plan to address these needs, including\ncofinancing and private capital support. The TA will identify potential areas for ADB support, and\nidentify the reforms that could be achieved by ADB involvement.\n31. ADB  is  conducting  advisory  TA  3453  (footnote  10)  to  consider  options  for  future\nownership  and  management  of  provincial  power  systems,  make  a  recommendation  for\nGovernment consideration, and commence staff training. Options under consideration include\n(i) implement EDC\u2019s charter to operate all provincial electricity systems; (ii) establish a provincial\npower utility, leaving EDC to operate only in Phnom Penh; (iii) offer franchises to the private\nsector; or (iv) let the provinces operate and own their own systems perhaps on a cooperative\nbasis. This TA will be completed early in 2001.\n32. The AFD is currently funding assistance to EDC in an attempt to increase sales in the\nindustry sector of Phnom Penh, which, under the present tariff system is one of the few sectors\nthat covers its supply costs. The assistance is therefore focused on identifying an optimal tariff\nstructure  for  the  sector  and  developing  a  marketing  strategy  designed  to  attract  these\nconsumers back to a grid supply and away from self-generation.\n33. In early 2000, Japan agreed to sponsor a 3-year study into the feasibility of establishing,\nin Sihanoukville, phased construction of a 180 MW power plant to feed into the proposed\nnational grid. The study will also review the feasibility of an offshore gas supply. The World\nBank with Japan Bank for International Cooperation fielded consultants in March 2000 to assess\nthe feasibility of constructing a high-voltage transmission line from the Vietnamese border,\nnorthward to Phnom Penh; and/or from a powerstation at Sihanoukville to Phnom Penh. This\nstudy will also address rural electrification policies and propose a 10-year rural electrification\nprogram.\nD.  Lessons Learned\n34. The electricity sector component of ADB\u2019s emergency loan to Cambodia has achieved\nits objectives of reinstating basic power supply to the capital. This project component was\ncompleted a few months later than planned, due primarily to the weak capacity of the executing\nagency (MIME) after a long period of civil war. All components of the second ADB loan,\nloan 1345 (footnote 2) were completed on time and within budget (except for completion of a\n                                                          \n13TA  2243-CAM:  Power  Sector  Manpower  Development  and  Training,  for  $500,000,  approved  on\n15 December 1994.\n14TA 3298-CAM: Developing the Strategy for ADB\u2019s Involvement in Cambodia\u2019s Power Sector, for $150,000,\napproved on 16 November 1999.", "10\nnew training center for EDC, which was six months late and not completed until June 2000).\nThe capacity building elements, which included EDC commercialization have strengthened EDC\nin many areas. ADB\u2019s support for the electricity sector can be regarded as generally successful,\nalthough with some shortcomings as described below.\n35. Electricity rehabilitation and expansion projects depend for their success on an accurate\nforecast of load demand. Plans for growth should reflect demand higher than the most likely rate\nbecause (i) projects have a tendency to be delayed, and (ii) slowing down a project is usually\nless expensive than accelerating it. However, the new generating capacity of 5.4 MW installed\nin Sihanoukville in 1998 under ADB loan 1345, based on load forecasts prepared in 1994, is\nwell in excess of the current demand because the rate of economic growth has been below the\npredicted level. For the Project, the scope has been updated by means of an additional TA\n(footnote 4), resulting in a reduced forecast demand and required infrastructure up to 2014,\ncompared to the estimate made in 1998.\n36. Because data on existing generation, sales, and consumers held by MIME and private\ngenerators is often unreliable, baseline data for the project towns will be collected using a\nsurvey and reclassification of existing and potential new customers by EDC, assisted by the\nimplementation consultant, prior to commencement of construction work. Future EDC statistics\non customer growth in the various categories, growth in individual consumption, electrification\nrates of poor areas, etc. will allow the success of the Project to be determined with greater\nreliability than would be the case if the feasibility study data alone were to form the baseline.\nThis follows the procedure adopted for provincial town electrical rehabilitation in Viet Nam.15\n37. One component of loan 1345 that did not yield the anticipated benefits was the training\nof accountants in the two provincial EDC offices on the use of hardware and software provided\nunder  the  project.  The  training  was  based  on  the  assumption  that  the  accountants  were\nsufficiently familiar with accounting principles to be able to use the software after a period of\ntraining and familiarization. In fact, the level of accounting skills was so low that the full potential\nof the software could not be utilized. Under the Project, in which the skill levels in the provincial\ntowns are even lower, basic skills training will form a significant component of the capacity\nbuilding effort. Compounding the problem of producing timely realistic accounts is the fact that\nthe Government requires accounts to be produced to its own standard, whereas the major\ndevelopment  agencies  require  accounts  to  international  standards.  This  is  unnecessarily\nburdensome and should be tackled at the national level.\nE. ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n38. The  country  operational  strategy  for  Cambodia  identifies  support  for  energy  sector\ndevelopment as a key component of an overall strategy to enhance the enabling environment\nfor private sector participation in the economy leading to growth and poverty reduction. Private\ninvestors identify high energy costs as one of the constraints inhibiting exploitation of business\nopportunities in Cambodia. Having provided emergency aid to electrify Phnom Penh, ADB\u2019s\nstrategy has been to help the Government implement its power sector policy to satisfy demand\nfor power where and when required. Due to constraints on financial and human resources,\npriorities  have  been  set  for  which  areas  will  benefit,  starting  with  Phnom  Penh;  then\nSihanoukville, the main port; Siem Reap, the main tourist destination; followed by provincial\ntowns and rural electrification. ADB has made a major contribution to rehabilitate and expand\nservices  in  Phnom  Penh,  Siem  Reap,  and  Sihanoukville  with  resulting  improvements  in\n                                                          \n15Loan 1358-VIE(SF):  Power Distribution Rehabilitation Project, for $79,978 million, approved on 8 June 1995.", "11\nstandard of service and lower tariffs.16 The electrical systems in the remainder of the country\nremain neglected and provide a severe obstacle to growth of even small-scale enterprises.\nADB\u2019s strategy is to first of all establish reliable and efficient systems in selected provincial\ntowns, and at the same time to improve management skills so that the private sector will be\nattracted to finance the orderly expansion of the systems on a competitive basis. Otherwise, a\ndanger exists that development will concentrate in the towns presently served by EDC, which\nwill prosper and expand, leaving other areas in a continually depressed state. ADB\u2019s strategy\nincludes measures to improve the efficiency of supply and lower the costs of services to\nconsumers.  The  strategy  will  be  more  effective  if  rural  infrastructure  is  improved  on  a\ncoordinated basis, through which the benefits are greater than the sum of those from individual\ncomponents. Therefore, where possible, provincial towns selected for electrification are also the\nsubject of complementary ADB assistance in the fields of water supply and roads (e.g., Kampot,\nSihanoukville, and Svay Rieng).\n39. Other development agencies, notably the World Bank and Japan Bank for International\nCooperation, are focusing on rural electrification and future high-voltage transmission systems.\nThe result of these strategies will be to distribute the benefits of aid support to diverse social\nand geographic groups in the interests of national harmony, equity, and efficiency. Therefore,\nADB\u2019s strategy is to concentrate on provincial towns, and to coordinate with its development\npartners to maximize the benefits to be gained by interaction between the transmission system,\nprovincial power supplies, and rural electrification.\n40. In  addition  to  funding  physical  infrastructure,  ADB\u2019s  strategy  is  to  promote  human\nresource development. Two areas of weakness have been identified: (i) in EDC, where financial\nmanagement,  forecasting,  and  system  planning  skills  need  strengthening;  and  (ii)  in  the\nprovinces, where trained and educated staff are in very short supply.\nF.  Policy Dialogue\n41. The Government requested the World Bank to be lead development agency in the\nenergy sector, and the World Bank has therefore initiated the main policy dialogue in recent\nyears supported by ADB. Dialogue has focused on drafting the electricity law, which will lead to\nestablishment of an electricity regulator, the EAC, to oversee all aspects of the sector. The\nelectricity law proposes that all future private contracts be awarded following a transparent\nprocess of competitive bidding. The regulations envisioned by the law, and ADB\u2019s work to\nstrengthen EDC\u2019s capacity are expected to increase private investor interest in helping meet\nCambodia\u2019s power requirements.\n42. As part of loan processing, ADB has led policy dialogue with the Government in two\ncritical areas, i.e., tariff reform in EDC\u2019s Phnom Penh area, and improvement of EDC\u2019s financial\nstatus.  Prior  to  August  2000,  the  tariff  structure  was  characterized  by  three  weaknesses:\n(i) tariffs for hotels and large industrial consumers were so high that they encouraged many\nlarge customers to turn to self-generation; (ii) the domestic tariff was well below the cost of\nsupply,  and  some  commercial  consumers  seemed  to  abuse  the  system,  pretending  to  be\ndomestic in order to obtain lower tariffs; and (iii) no incentives were given to reduce peak load.\nAs a result of the dialogue, a required substantial tariff increase effective from 1 August 2000\nhas (i) raised average tariffs by 16 percent, including an average 57 percent increase to tariffs in\nthe  domestic  sector,  and  (ii)  reduced  average  tariffs  by  about  10  percent  for  industrial\n                                                          \n16Current tariffs in Phnom Penh, which were close to the required level for 1999, are about 40 percent below\nprevailing tariffs in the provincial towns.", "12\nconsumers. This has substantially reduced the extent of cross-subsidies and should prevent\npresent industrial customers from turning to self-generation. The Government has agreed to\nreduce its arrears to EDC to at most two months of sales and to put in place a mechanism for\nGovernment ministries and departments to become and remain current with their payments to\nEDC.\n43. The Government has approved a lifeline tariff of KR350 ($0.09) per kWh for the first\n50 kWh of domestic consumption. The financial deficit resulting from the lifeline tariff is to be\nfunded by cross-subsidy from other (commercial and industrial) consumers. While this creates\nthe problem of high tariffs for the latter groups, the alternative of direct Government subsidies if\napplied  should  be  governed  by  the  following  principles,  which  are  reflected  in  the  loan\ndocuments. To measure and monitor EDC\u2019s satisfactory financial performance, ADB will only\naccept subsidies to be included in EDC\u2019s income if the following conditions are met: (i) subsidy\npayments are reasonably justified by documentation in an official Government policy paper;\n(ii) subsidies must be focused on low-income consumers; (iii) average subsidies for EDC\u2019s\nurban consumers in Phnom Penh should not exceed average subsidies for provincial or rural\nconsumers; and (iv) subsidies must be paid in a regular manner (not ad hoc), through a special\naccount, approved in advance, in the Government\u2019s annual budget.\nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA.  Rationale\n44. The country needs a reliable, affordable, and efficient electricity supply as a fundamental\ninput for economic growth leading to poverty reduction. Substantial improvement of the living\nstandards of the rural poor is closely linked with economic development in urban centers. The\nexpected benefits of rural development can be realized only if farmers are able to sell their\nincreased agricultural produce in the urban economy in exchange for such items as new farming\nequipment,  fertilizer,  seeds,  technology,  and  better  consumer  goods.  Rural  development,\ntherefore, is correlated to the absorptive capacity of the urban economy for increased rural\nproduce. The provincial towns in the country serve as the economic centers for the rural\nhinterland. In the provinces, these towns are the immediate markets, transport depots, and\nprocessing  centers  for  provincial  agricultural  products.  Improving  urban  services,  including\nelectricity supplies in the provincial towns will therefore contribute to poverty reduction in both\nrural and urban areas. Adequate electricity systems are absent from the whole of the country\nwith the exceptions of Kompong Cham, Phnom Penh, Siem Reap, and Sihanoukville.\n45. In the other provinces, the owners, both MIME and the private sector operators, have\nneither the capital nor the creditworthiness to fund rehabilitation, expansion, or upgrading of the\nsystems. The existing high tariffs demonstrate a willingness to pay for even an inferior supply,\nand surveys conducted under the project preparatory TA show that improved and extended\nservices will attract new customers. The Project will rehabilitate and expand the electricity\ngenerating  and  distribution  systems  in  selected  provincial  capitals,  and  train  staff  in  their\noperation, maintenance, and management. The resulting systems will (i) provide a 24-hour per\nday supply of high reliability and acceptable loss levels,17 (ii) reduce average tariffs in the project\ntowns, and (iii) allow for future system expansion. Two of the selected towns, Kampot and Svay\nRieng, are included in ADB\u2019s Provincial Towns Improvement Project,18 which will also provide\n                                                          \n17The target transmission and distribution loss level under the new systems is 18 percent.\n18Loan 1725-CAM(SF):  Provincial Towns Improvement Project, for $20 million, approved on 17 December 1999.", "13\nrenewed sewerage and water supply systems for Sihanoukville whose electricity system was\nrehabilitated under ADB loan 1345 (footnote 2).\n46. No legal or administrative barriers exist for private sector participation in public electricity\nsupply, but virtually all private producers to date are extremely low caliber, very small scale, and\nusing second-hand equipment. Public safety is an issue in power supply and internationally\nacceptable  standards  should  be  maintained.  Without  external  intervention,  the  needed\nimprovements in electricity supply are unlikely to materialize. At this early stage of Cambodia\u2019s\ndevelopment, provision of basic infrastructure (even revenue generating) cannot be left to the\nprivate sector alone. Therefore, concessional funding is required. The Project will be owned and\noperated,  at  least  initially  by  EDC,  which  will  receive  sufficient  help  with  human  resource\ndevelopment to enable efficient operation of the systems. EDC has a record of taking over and\nmanaging  systems  of  similar  size  and  larger,  decreasing  losses,  and  improving  accounts\nreceivable and customer service. ADB is aware that public ownership may not be the best long-\nterm  situation,  and  ongoing  TA  3453  (footnote  10)  will  identify  a  wide  range  of  possible\nalternatives for Government consideration.\nB.  Objectives and Scope\n47. The long-term objective of the Project is to stimulate economic growth and thereby\nreduce urban poverty in the selected provincial towns and the surrounding rural populations,\nwith the longer term goal of creating the enabling environment for private sector participation in\nfuture power system expansion. Appendix 4 gives information on the selected towns. The\nimmediate purposes of the Project are to (i) expand the availability of reliable power supplies in\neight  provincial  towns;  (ii)  build  capacity  by  creating  suitable  management,  operation,  and\nmaintenance  organizations  in  the  provincial  centers  so  the  new  systems  are  efficient  and\nfinancially viable; (iii) strengthen the skills in the EDC head office (which will remain responsible\nfor over 90 percent of EDC sales); (iv) expand the scope of training available at EDC\u2019s ADB-\nfunded training center in Phnom Penh; and (v) setup a data-gathering system on which to base\nfuture hydropower development. The scope comprises two parts:  Part A, Infrastructure; and\nPart B, Capacity Building.\n1.  Part A:  Infrastructure\n48. The Project will improve the electricity systems in the capital towns of eight provinces.\nThe distribution systems will be replaced and/or expanded in the towns of Banlung, Kampot,\nKompong Speu, Prey Veng, Sisophon, Stung Treng, Svay Rieng, and Takeo. In addition, the\nsource of electricity will be expanded by providing new generator sets in Kampot, Prey Veng,\nSisophon, Stung Treng, and Takeo. In Kampot, new generating equipment will supplement the\nexisting 1.3 MW of privately operated generating equipment which will remain in service. EDC\nwill purchase energy from the private operator. Svay Rieng will be supplied via a new 22 kV\nconnection from Viet Nam. The route has been selected to supply power to a number of villages\nand an irrigation system along the way. Kompong Speu will be served by a short 22 kV line from\na substation on the proposed new transmission line to be constructed as part of the build-\noperate-transfer rehabilitation of Kirirom hydropower plant.19 Banlung in Rattanakiri Province is\nserved by a 1 MW hydropower plant, commissioned in 1993, with adequate generating capacity.\n                                                          \n19MIME recently signed an implementation agreement, and EDC a PPA, with a private developer to reconstruct the\n12 MW Kirirom hydropowerplant project and build a 115 kV transmission line from the plant to Phnom Penh, on a\nbuild-operate-transfer basis. The agreements provide for construction of a 115/22 kV substation at Kompong Speu.", "14\n49. Kompong Speu, Sisophon, and Stung Treng do not have a medium-voltage distribution\nsystem, only 0.4 kV lines from the generators to consumers. Where medium-voltage systems\nexist, they comprise 4.5, 6.3, 10, and 15 kV sections, all of inadequate size and condition, with\nthe exceptions of (i) Banlung where the 10 kV line from the hydropower project is in good\ncondition and will be retained; and (ii) Prey Veng where some 15 kV underground cables and\nsubstations  were  installed  in  1997  and  will  be  retained.  The  feeders  and  low-voltage\nconnections, substations, and meters (where they exist) will be replaced with 22 kV (except\nBanlung and Prey Veng) and 0.4 kV systems will be replaced and extended using readily\navailable standard components designed to acceptable levels of cost-effectiveness and safety.\nPresently, only the town\u2019s central areas have a grid supply. Under the Project, the medium-\nvoltage systems will be extended along the peripheral roads into the semi-urban areas and\nvillages close to the towns where there is a greater proportion of low-income households. At\nsome locations, e.g., between Angtassom and Takeo, a few existing support poles can be\nretained.\n50. The new generators will be diesel-engined generating sets of sizes 250 kW and 500 kW\nand of standard design. The generators will be skid-mounted and housed in purpose-designed\nsimple buildings. Fuel will be stored in tanks at each power station with adequate measures to\nprevent  spilt  fuel  from  leaking  into  the  soil.  Moats  will  be  built  around  each  tank  with\nimpermeable membranes. The moat will have sufficient capacity to contain the total contents of\nthe tank in case of rupture. All the systems will be designed to supply load growth up to the end\nof 2006 and provide a solid base for system development thereafter. Beyond 2006, relatively\nsmaller  additions  will  be  required  for  distribution  system  expansion  and  new  generating\ncapacity. The new project works will be brought into service between mid-2003 and mid-2004.\nKampot, Kompong Speu, Svay Rieng, and Takeo have sufficient land available in the existing\npower plant areas, which are owned by MIME, for the new equipment and facilities that will be\nrequired. In the other towns, new sites, which have minimal social impacts, have also been\nidentified.\n2.  Part B: Capacity Building\na.  Provincial Power Systems\n51. The objective of this project component is to fully establish and make operational, the\norganization that will operate and manage the provincial power supplies. This component will\nbuild on the work achieved under TA 3453 (footnote 10) for the most appropriate structure for\nownership,  management,  and  operation  of  future  provincial  power  supplies.  Whatever\norganizational structure is adopted, the physical and human resources necessary to make it\nfunction do not exist; this project component will address this deficiency by staff training and\nequipping of offices.\n(i)  Up to 100 staff mainly from the provincial offices of MIME, or newly\nrecruited, will receive training in English and computer skills. Selected\nstaff  will  receive  training  in  general  business  management,  financial\nmonitoring  and  control,  and  accounting  at  the  National  Institute  of\nManagement in Phnom Penh. Others will receive technical training at the\nexisting  ADB-funded  EDC  Training  Center  in  Phnom  Penh.  A  similar\ntraining program financed by the World Bank successfully trained a wide\nrange of EDC and MIME staff.", "15\n(ii)  Utility offices will be required in each provincial town for billing, collection,\ncustomer  services,  financial  accounting  and  projections,  procurement,\nand other management and reporting functions. Some of these functions\nare  presently  carried  out,  in  a  rudimentary  way,  by  either  private\noperators or MIME from poorly equipped premises. This subcomponent\nwill include refurbishment and purchase of equipment for eight regional\noffices to enable these functions to be carried out efficiently. Equipment\nwill include furniture, computers, and software programs.\nb.  Strengthening of Head Office Facilities\ni.  Financial Management Adviser to EDC\n52. While  EDC\u2019s  financial  systems  are  computerized  and  provide  relatively  timely\ninformation,  EDC\u2019s  accounting  policies  are  not  well  documented  in  its  accounting  manual.\nExternal  auditors  are  assisting  EDC  to  improve  its  accounting  and  reporting  capabilities.\nHowever, EDC lacks experienced in-house capacity for preparing financial forecasts beyond\none year. As part of the Project, ADB will fund a financial adviser to train staff and help EDC\nstrengthen its financial and accounting functions, implement its financial recovery plan, improve\nits financial forecasting capability, upgrade its financial management information systems, and\nstrengthen its internal audit capability. Intermittent inputs by an international expert over three\nyears will be provided.\nii.  Planning Adviser to EDC\n53. The World Bank funded the services of an international adviser to EDC for two years up\nto 31 December 1999 under its Phnom Penh Power Rehabilitation Project. ADB continued to\nfund these services for six months to the end of June 2000 under loan 1345 (footnote 2). This\nadviser has played a key role in providing assistance to EDC in developing and implementing\ngeneration  and  distribution  projects  constructed  with  ADB,  World  Bank,  and  bilateral  aid\nassistance. Under the Project, the services of an adviser will be continued for two years,\nworking  principally  in  the  Corporate  Planning  and  Projects  Department,  to  help  prepare\ndocumentation for contracts with private service suppliers, evaluate bids, and coordinate and\nmonitor EDC\u2019s loss reduction action plan and the capacity building components of the Project.\niii.  Trainers for EDC Training Center\n54. EDC staff are currently undertaking technical training at the ADB-funded training center\nin Phnom Penh. French (AFD) grant assistance has been provided to fund training on the\ninstallation and maintenance of low and medium voltage equipment as used in the EDC system.\nBy 2004, the first interconnection with Viet Nam at 230 kV will be commissioned. Under the\nProject, trainers will be recruited to teach skills related to high voltage transmission systems\ntogether with power utility management and system planning.\niv.  Training Center Facilities\n55. The original design for the EDC training center included two dormitory blocks for use by\nout-of-town students and the academic staff; the site has sufficient space for construction of\nthese buildings. Due to lack of funds, this item was deleted from the scope of work under\nloan 1345 (footnote 2) and will be included under the Project. The Project will also include", "16\npurchase of a bus to transport students from their residences to the training center, which is\nlocated in the outskirts of Phnom Penh.\nv.  Hydrological Network\n56. Cambodia has significant hydroelectric potential, with almost none exploited to date.\nPotential exists for micro, mini, small, and medium-size plants. MIME\u2019s Hydropower Department\nhas conducted several desk studies whose use is limited by a lack of hydrological data on which\nto estimate firm power and total energy outputs. There are areas of the country such as the\nKravanh Mountains in the west where microhydro projects may be feasible for village supplies\nand, for example, on the Battambang River where larger projects, e.g., of 24 MW and larger\ncould serve the future needs of the town and province. A small component of the loan will be\nallocated to establishing a number of flow gauges in these areas as an essential prerequisite for\nfeasibility studies. The services of a hydropower engineer-hydrologist will be provided initially to\nidentify  suitable  gauging  sites,  to  instruct  staff  of  the  Hydropower  Department  on  gauge\ninstallation and operation and on data collection and interpretation. The necessary equipment\nfor two gauges on each of three rivers is included in the Project. MIME staff should be capable\nof expanding the gauging network thereafter without further assistance.\nC.  Technical Justification\n57. With the exception of Banlung and Kampot, the generating equipment is in a state of\nsevere disrepair, kept in operation only by the mechanical ingenuity of the operators. In the\ninterests of safety and economy, it must be replaced. Banlung is served by a 1 MW hydropower\nplant consisting of 2x500 kW turbine generators, with a storage reservoir to ensure dry season\nfirm capacity of 300 kW. This plant provides the sole supply for the town, although the two main\nindustries (rubber processing and wood products) have their own standby generators. The study\ncompleted under the project preparation TA, found no economic method to enhance the firm\ncapacity of the hydropower plant.\n58. For the study towns, no realistic alternatives to diesel power stations currently exist.\nTheoretically, a number of other forms of power generation are possible, but they are more\nexpensive than diesel engines. Alternative generating options investigated include the use of\nrenewable energies such as biomass-fired power plants, wind energy converters, solar power\ngeneration,  and  minihydro.  All  other  types  of  power  generation  conceivable  for  Cambodia\ninvolve central power stations from which electricity would be supplied to the various towns\nthrough transmission lines. Due to the comparatively low electricity consumption in the towns\nstudied, the high capital costs of the necessary transmission lines cannot be justified.\nD. Cost Estimates\n59. The project cost estimate is based on the TA (footnote 3), updated in June 2000, using\nMarch 2000 price levels. Costs are based on similar items of equipment supplied and installed\nrecently in Cambodia. The project cost includes all investments required in distribution and new\ngeneration to serve all new load growth up to the end of 2006, and provide a solid base for\nfuture development. After 2006, additional but relatively smaller investments will still be required\nfor distribution system expansion and new generating capacity. These can be financed by a\ncombination of future retained earnings, foreign aid, commercial borrowing, and/or investments\nby local private power producers in new diesel generating capacity. The total project cost is\nestimated to be $24.2 million equivalent, of which the foreign exchange cost is $12.1 million and", "17\nthe local currency cost is $12.1 million. Detailed cost estimates are given in Appendix 5 and\nsummarized in Table 1.\nTable 1:  Project Cost Estimate\n($ million)\nForeign Local Total\nItem\nExchange Currencyd Cost\nBase Costs (March 2000 prices)\nPart A:  Infrastructurea 8.2 9.1 17.3\nPart B:  Capacity Building 1.8 0.8 2.6\nSubtotal (Base Cost) 10.0 9.9 19.9\nContingencies\nPhysicalb 1.0 1.0 2.0\nPrice Escalationc 0.8 0.8 1.6\nSubtotal (Contingencies) 1.8 1.8 3.6\nInterest During Construction 0.3 0.4 0.7\nTotal 12.1 12.1 24.2\nPercent 50 50 100\na Including land and compensation costs.\nb Physical contingencies: 10 percent.\nc Price contingencies:  2.4 percent per annum.\nd Including duties and taxes amounting to $3.5 million (14 percent of total project cost).\nSource:  Staff estimates.\nE. Financing Plan\n60. Proposed ADB financing is for a loan of up to $18.6 million equivalent (77 percent of the\ntotal project cost) including $6.5 million equivalent of the local currency cost (Table 2). ADB\nfinancing of the local currency cost is justified on the basis of the low level of national income\n($256 per capita estimated for 1999) and savings (8 percent of the national income in 1999) as\nwell as Government fiscal deficit (4 percent of gross domestic product in 1999).20 The balance\nof $5.6 million equivalent will be financed by EDC and the Government. The Government is\nseeking parallel cofinancing from AFD of about $2.5 million equivalent on a grant basis to cover\n$1.7 million of foreign exchange costs plus $0.8 million equivalent of local currency costs. AFD\nfinancing is expected to cover the infrastructure in Stung Treng, partial provision of trainers at\nthe EDC training center and advisers for EDC. Should the loan negotiations between the\nGovernment and AFD be successfully concluded within six months of the effectiveness date of\nthe ADB loan for the Project, and on terms and conditions acceptable to ADB, the Borrower will\nrequest that ADB reallocate or cancel the relevant portion of the loan funds. The ADB loan will\nbe from the Special Funds resources with a term of 32 years including a grace period of\n8 years. The annual service charge will be 1.0 percent during the grace period and 1.5 percent\nthereafter.  The  Borrower  will  be  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia.  The  Government  will  relend\n$17.5 million equivalent to EDC at an interest rate of 3.5 percent per annum with a repayment\nperiod of 20 years, including a 5-year grace period. EDC will bear the foreign exchange risk.\nThe balance of the loan proceeds plus the Government\u2019s contribution, will be passed on to\nEDC/MIME on a grant basis.\n                                                          \n20ADB.

Implementation Arrangements\n1.  Project Implementation and Schedule\n61. The Executing Agency for the Project will be EDC, as it will be the owner and operator of\nthe facilities (at least initially), and the beneficiary of the majority of the institutional capacity\nbuilding. Two ADB-funded projects (footnotes 1 and 2) have been completed in the power\nsector.  For  both  loans,  the  project  implementing  agency  (for  the  power  component)  was\nElectricit\u00e9 du Phnom Penh, the forerunner of EDC. EDC has shown that it has the capability to\nsuccessfully implement similar projects in the fields of power generation and distribution. The\ntechnical aspects of the Project are relatively simple, although monitoring and coordinating\nactivities at the eight towns will require careful planning.\n62. EDC  will  set  up  a  project  implementation  unit  headed  by  a  senior  staff  member\nacceptable to ADB. The unit will be based at EDC headquarters in Phnom Penh due to its\ncentral  location,  but  use  will  be  made  of  MIME  provincial  offices  during  the  design  and\nconstruction  phases.  Staff  from  EDC  and  MIME  will  be  assigned  as  counterparts  to  the\nconsultants.  The  implementation  period  will  be  42  months  from  loan  approval.  The\nimplementation schedule is presented in Appendix 6.\n2.  Procurement\n63. ADB-financed procurement will be in accordance with ADB Guidelines for Procurement.\nMaterials, equipment, and their installation and erection for rehabilitation and expansion of the\ndistribution systems (i.e., the medium and low voltage equipment) will be procured using ADB\nprocedures  for  procurement  of  goods  and  related  services  under  international  competitive\nbidding.  A  single  contract  will  be  awarded  for  the  distribution  systems  covering  the  work\nfinanced by ADB, this will allow the greatest flexibility during implementation and the least stock\nof spares during the operation phase. Generating sets, together with necessary spare parts for\nthe work financed by ADB, will be supplied and installed under a single, turnkey contract under\ninternational competitive bidding. This contract will include design and construction of the small-\nscale powerhouse, control building, associated facilities, and training of operators. Bids will be\nevaluated on the basis of lifetime costs with penalties imposed on contractors for equipment\nwhose  performance  is  below  the  tendered  value.  Preference  will  be  given  to  domestic\ncontractors  and  domestically  manufactured  goods  procured  under  international  competitive\nbidding. Civil works contracts with an estimated value of more than $1 million, and contracts for\nsupply  of  goods  and  services  estimated  at  more  than  $500,000  will  be  procured  using\ninternational  competitive  bidding  procedures.  Other  equipment  will  be  procured  under", "19\ninternational shopping procedures. The works are not complex and postqualification procedures\nfor all contracts, as successfully adopted for loan 1345 (footnote 2) will be used. Indicative\nprocurement  packages  are  shown  in  Appendix  7.  Procurement  of  any  project  goods  and\nservices financed by AFD will be undertaken in accordance with its own procedures.\n3.  Consulting Services\n64. The consulting services package will cover (i) design of the facilities in the eight selected\ntowns; (ii) assistance with tender evaluation; (iii) supervision of construction; and (iv) assistance\nwith planning, implementing, controlling, and monitoring the capacity building components of the\nproject.  These  activities  will  be  included  in  a  consulting  services  package  with  a  total  of\n48 person-months  (23 person-months  of  international  and  25  person-months  of  domestic\nconsultants). ADB approved action will be taken for advance procurement of the consultants, so\nthat  survey  and  design  work  can  commence  soon  after  loan  effectivity.  Outline  terms  of\nreference for consulting services are given in Appendix 8. Consulting services will be procured\nin  accordance  with  ADB  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants  and  other  arrangements\nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. The Government has advised\nthat a tax of 15 percent will be applied to consulting services.\n4.  Disbursement Arrangements\n65. Disbursements of ADB funds under the Project will be mainly for supply and installation\nof goods, including turnkey contracts. In accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook,\ncommitment procedures will be used. Direct payment procedures will be used for consulting\nservices. Eligible local currency cost purchases will be reimbursed.\n5.  Midterm Review\n66. A midterm review, to be carried out 15 months after loan effectiveness, will focus on the\ncapacity building, environmental, and training aspects of the Project with the aim of ensuring\nthat the provincial power utilities have adequate human and other resources necessary to\nmanage the completed facilities.\n6. Operation and Maintenance\n67. Operation and maintenance of the completed works will be the responsibility of the\nprovincial power utility (initially EDC). Staff will be given suitable training under the Project.\nA suitable provision to cover the fixed and variable costs of operation and maintenance of the\nProject has been included in the tariff in the calculation of the project financial internal rate of\nreturn, and in the preparation of financial forecasts.\n7.  Reports, Accounts, and Audits\n68. Regular progress reports will be prepared for the Project and submitted to ADB on a\nquarterly basis. The reports will include a description of the physical progress and a summary of\nfinancial accounts for the Project, including project expenditures during the period, year-to-date,\nand total expenditure to date. A project completion report will be submitted to ADB within three\nmonths after project completion.", "20\n69. Separate  accounts  will  be  maintained  for  the  Project  by  EDC  in  accordance  with\ninternational accounting standards. Within six months of the close of the fiscal year, detailed\nannual project accounts and financial statements of EDC consisting of an income statement,\nbalance sheet, and a sources and application of funds statement for each system operated by\nEDC will be submitted to ADB. These financial statements audited by an auditor acceptable to\nADB, will be submitted to ADB within twelve months of the close of the fiscal year.\n8.  Monitoring and Evaluation\n70. A number of easily measured performance targets have been selected to monitor the\nsuccess of the completed Project in accordance with ADB\u2019s project performance monitoring\nsystem. To measure the impact on economic growth, the number of new electricity customers in\nvarious categories will be monitored by comparing baseline data with future billing records of the\nutilities, i.e., number of new industrial and commercial customers, and number of new social\nfacilities such as schools and clinics. The direct financial impact on the domestic sector will be\nmeasured by means of the number of consumers in each new tariff block compared with the\npresent tariff. The number of consumers in the lowest consumption tariff block will indicate the\nextent to which electricity is being adopted by the low-income sectors of society. Efficiencies in\nthe  utility  operations  will  be  measured  by  data  on  electrical  losses,  sales  lost  through\nbreakdowns, employee-customer ratios, and average cost of service. The degree of compliance\nwith  financial  covenants  will  be  an  indication  of  the  performance  of  EDC  throughout  the\nimplementation period.\nG.  The Executing Agency\n1. Recent Developments\n71. At the beginning of 2000, EDC was in a precarious financial position and unable to\ncomply with its financial covenants. After ADB\u2019s Fact-Finding Mission in February 2000, EDC\nprepared and started to implement a financial recovery action plan with full MEF support and\nADB agreement. The plan includes the following key elements:\n(i)  The tariff structure was revised to reduce the undesirable cross-subsidies to the\ndomestic sector from industrial and commercial customers.\n(ii)  In July 2000, ADB responded to a Government request and agreed to convert\nloan 1345 (footnote 2) to equity in order to ease EDC\u2019s debt service burden. This\nconcession will benefit EDC\u2019s branches at Sihanoukville and Siem Reap, the\nprincipal beneficiaries under the Provincial Power Project.\n(iii)  The Government has reduced its overdue electricity bills (from KR49.4 billion at\nthe end of 1999) by KR31.9 billion to less than three-months of sales. A portion\nof this amount (about KR21 billion) has been used to offset current taxes due to\nthe Government. By the end of 2000, the Government has committed to further\nreduce  overdue  accounts  by  KR7.8  billion.  For  2001,  the  receivables  of\nGovernment ministries and agencies will be reduced to the equivalent of two\nmonths of sales.\n(iv)  Special  measures  are  being  introduced  to  ensure  future  timely  payments  of\nelectricity bills by Government ministries and agencies:", "21\n(a)  Each  annual  national  budget  (approved  by  the  National  Assembly)  will\ncontain an allocation for electricity consumption for each month, for each\ngovernment  ministry,  agency,  or  organization.  All  ministers  and\norganization heads will be responsible for adhering to the budget.\n(b)  Each  organization  will  enter  into  a  contract  with  EDC  for  supply  and\npayment of the budgeted monthly electricity consumption.\n(c)  Within an agreed period after receipt of the electricity bill, the organization\nrepresentative will certify to EDC that the bill is correct or query it with EDC.\nIf  EDC  is  not  notified  within  a  specified  period,  it  may  temporarily\ndisconnect the supply to that organization.\n(d)  Each certified bill will be passed to MEF for payment to EDC within two\nmonths of issuance of the bill.\n(e)  Unless MEF approves reallocation of an organization\u2019s budget, EDC may\ndisconnect the supply when the budget allocation is reached.\n(f)  MEF\u2019s existing financial controllers will review consumption on a monthly\nbasis and report the need for corrective action to the high level committee\n(presently the EDC Board).\n(v)  EDC has implemented a program with AFD assistance to reduce its transmission\nand distribution losses to 20 percent in 2000, 19 percent in 2001, 18 percent in\n2002, and 17 percent thereafter.\n(vi)  The Government has agreed to restructure electricity tariffs to enable EDC to\nachieve the covenanted financial targets.\n72. ADB views the actions taken by EDC and Government to implement EDC\u2019s action plan\nfor financial recovery as an effective response to EDC\u2019s financial crisis. Tariffs will still need to\nbe increased in 2001 if fuel prices do not fall below forecast levels. However, the Government\nhas raised tariffs over the last two years by over 50 percent. These increases have been as\nmuch as could be reasonably expected politically for domestic consumers.\n2. EDC\u2019s Past Financial Performance\n73. EDC\u2019s historical financial performance, since its commercialization in 1996 is shown in\nTable 3. Figures for 1997 and 1998 refer to Phnom Penh service area only. Commencing in\n1998, EDC produced accounts consolidating its operations in Kompong Cham, Siem Reap, and\nSihanoukville. However, EDC\u2019s performance is dominated by its operators in Phnom Penh,\nwhich accounted for 93 percent of sales in 1999.", "22\nTable 3:  EDC\u2019s (Phnom Penh) Historical Financial Performance\n(KR billion)\nIndicator Audited 1997 Audited 1998 Audited 1999\nEnergy Sales (GWh) 218 266 264\nSales Growth (%) 29 22 (1)\nOperating Revenue 79 104 146\nOperating Expenditure 90 150 145\nAverage Revenue (KR/kWh) 354 371 504\nAverage Tariff Increase (%) 3.5 4.8 35.8\nOperating Income (11) (47) 1\nNet Income (14) (50) (4)\nDebt Service 0 0 5\nFinancial Ratios:\nSelf Financing Ratio (%) 0 0 12\nDebt Service Ratio (times)a \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\nDebt Equity Ratio 31/69 65/35 77/23\nReceivables \u2013months 5.3 5.4 5.7\nGWh = gigawatt-hour; kWh = kilowatt-hour.\na Debt  service  ratios  were  not  calculated  since  no  debt  service  payments  were  made  on\nADB/World Bank loans and there was no other debt being serviced.\n74. Net losses of KR14 billion ($3.7 million) and KR50 billion ($13.2 million) in 1997 and\n1998 were reduced to KR4 billion ($1.05 million) in 1999, following a 40 percent increase in\ntariffs in April 1999. EDC\u2019s cost of fuel and power purchases from IPPs represented 71 percent\nof its total revenues in 1999. All EDC\u2019s fuel is imported, and all its payments for bulk power\nsupply from IPPs are in dollars so that about 70 percent of its operational costs are incurred in\ndollars. Inadequate domestic tariffs, sharply rising fuel costs and high system losses were the\ncause of these financial losses. System losses exceeded 30 percent in 1997 but have been\nprogressively reduced to close to 20 percent in 2000. These losses together with a high level of\nunpaid Government electricity bills have led to very weak financial performance. The rate of\nsales growth dropped sharply following the large tariff increases in early 1999.\n3. Compliance with Financial and Operating Covenants\n75. The principal financial covenants agreed with EDC under the first Power Rehabilitation\nProject, and applied following its incorporation in 1996, have not been met. These principal\nfinancial covenants include (i) 30 percent minimum level of self-financing of EDC\u2019s average\nannual capital expenditure; (ii) a minimum debt service cover of 1.3 times; (iii) a debt-equity\nratio not exceeding 60/40; and (iv) accounts receivable not exceeding three months electricity\nsales. Self-financing has been less than 12 percent per annum in each of the last three years\n(1997-1999). The debt service covenant has not been relevant since the debt service payments\nunder the existing World Bank and ADB loans have not yet commenced.\n76. Electricity sales accounts receivable have been consistently higher than five months\nbillings, and well above the three months average electricity sales level agreed with ADB.\nNoncompliance has been almost entirely due to the level of accounts receivable from the\nGovernment. Nongovernment arrears amount to less than one month of sales, as a result of\nstrict  compliance  with  the  disconnection  policy.  The  high  levels  of  receivables  and  the", "23\nsuccession of operating losses has placed EDC in a severe liquidity crisis that has led to the\nneed for short-term borrowing.\n4. Electricity Tariffs\n77. Cambodia does not have a policy of uniform tariffs; each town has a tariff based on the\ncost of supply. EDC's average tariff increase for Phnom Penh of about 40 percent in April 1999\nplaced the entire burden of that tariff increase on commercial and industrial consumers, while\nleaving domestic tariffs unchanged. As a result of this large tariff increase, many of the larger\ncommercial and industrial consumers began to generate their own power, which was less costly\nthan the EDC tariff rate. For the last tariff adjustment in August 2000, EDC recognized that\ndomestic tariffs, which had remained unchanged at KR350 ($0.091) per kWh since 1995, would\nalso have to increase significantly (footnote 8). A lifeline tariff of KR350 per kWh was retained\nfor domestic consumption up to 50 kWh per month, to protect smaller, low-income consumers.\nFor domestic consumption from 50 to 100 kWh per month, the tariff increased to KR550\n($0.143) per kWh, and for consumption in excess of 100 kWh the tariff increased to KR650\n($0.169)  per  kWh.  Although  the  percentage  increase  for  this  last  group  is  high,  most\nconsumption by large domestic accounts was actually being used by commercial enterprises\ntaking  advantage  of  the  low  domestic  tariff.  Now  any  domestic  consumption  in  excess  of\n100 kWh per month is charged at the same tariff as small commercial consumers. EDC's\ncurrent tariff structure, and the estimated cross-subsidies in this structure, are summarized in\nTable 4.\nTable 4:  EDC Tariff Structure and Cross Subsidies in Phnom Penh\nAverage Tariff\nShare of Estimated Estimated\nUp to 31\nEnergy From 1 Aug. 2000 Cost Cross\nJuly 2000\nCategory Sold (%) of Supply Subsidy\n(% cost of\nKR/kWh KR/kWh $/kWh KR/kWh\nsupply)\nDomestic, <50 kWh/month 12.9 350 350 0.091 850 59\nDomestic, 50-100 kWh/month 10.3 350 550 0.143 750 27\nDomestic, >100 kWh/month 24.3 350 650 0.169 675 4\nGovernment 16.3 700 700 0.182 550 (27)\nForeigners 7.3 800 800 0.208 675 (19)\nHotels 2.2 787 641 0.166 450 (42)\nCommercial 10.4 640 640 0.166 425 (51)\nIndustrial 12.4 632 582 0.151 400 (45)\nMedium Voltage 4.0 540 480 0.125 360 (33)\nAverage Tariff 521 604 0.157 604\n5. EDC\u2019s Financial Projections\n78. Financial projections for 2004 to 2010 were prepared for the project towns, and for 2000\nto  2007  for  the  consolidated  accounts  of  EDC  including  its  branches  at  Kompong  Cham,\nSiem Reap,  and  Sihanoukville,  and  the  project  towns.  A  summary  of  EDC\u2019s  projected\nconsolidated financial performance based on EDC\u2019s planned investments and electricity sales\nforecasts is provided in Table 5. More detailed information and assumptions underlying the\nfinancial projections are given in Appendix 9.", "24\nTable 5:  EDC\u2019s Projected Consolidated Financial Performance (FY2000-FY2007)\n(KR billions)\nIndicator 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007\nEnergy Sales (GWh) 337 391 455 515 594 667 748 840\nSales Growth (%) 20 16 16 13 15 12 12 12\nOperating Revenue 198 260 325 395 440 493 565 660\nOperating Expenditure 232 264 295 353 360 421 495 582\nAvg.

The projections show that EDC is expected to achieve some reductions in its operating\ncosts. For example, in mid-2000, EDC converted its diesel generators at the C6 power station\nfrom  diesel  fuel  to  cheaper  heavy  fuel  oil.  In  2004,  when  the  Viet  Nam-Phnom  Penh\ninterconnection is built, economies should also be achieved from the purchase of lower cost\npower from Viet Nam.\n80. Although EDC and Government have taken several steps to effect EDC\u2019s financial\nrecovery, these are not sufficient to offset continuing high prices for fuel based on international\nprices for crude oil, currently above $30 a barrel. The financial projections incorporate the tariffs\napplicable from 1 August 2000, and conversion of ADB\u2019s earlier loan to equity. The projections\nassume fuel costs are based on international crude oil prices of $28 in 2000, $25 in 2001, $21 in\n2002,  and  $20  thereafter  (based  on  World  Bank  estimates).  With  these  assumptions,  the\nfinancial forecasts show that EDC will continue to incur a loss of nearly KR50 billion in 2000 and\nover KR30 billion in 2001. Therefore, tariff increases of about 13 percent, 7 percent, and 8\npercent per year are needed in 2001, 2002, and 2003, to meet the covenanted financial targets.\nTo meet the projected cash shortfall in 2000, EDC will need to seek additional working capital\nfunds of about KR44 billion to meet its commitments for fuel, power purchases, and finances of\nother current assets.\n81. In the case of the provincial towns being financed under the Project, the Government\nhas agreed to set tariffs for each town at levels to achieve cash breakeven every full financial\nyear after project commissioning and 3 percent rate of return on net revalued fixed assets in\nservice in the first full year after commissioning and 4 percent thereafter. The current weighted\naverage tariff in the eight provincial towns is about $0.26 per kWh. With the Project and to\nachieve the targeted covenants, the weighted average tariffs in 2004 could be reduced by about\n7 percent for a far superior and sustainable service. Between 2004 and 2010, the average tariffs\nin the project towns are forecast to fall by over 20 percent in real terms. The project towns will\nneed working capital for start-up to pay for fuel, power purchases, salaries, and for financing\nreceivables, etc. EDC will accordingly be expected to provide working capital from its own\nsources of funds for the provincial towns.", "25\nH. Environmental and Social Measures\n1.  Environment\n82. The major physical component of the Project is to rehabilitate electricity facilities in\nselected  provincial  towns.  The  rehabilitation  will  include  replacement  of  old  distribution\nequipment and facilities such as transformers, installation of small-size diesel generating sets\n(250-500 kW range), and improvement of medium and low voltage distribution systems. These\nmajor components are expected to have only small environmental impacts, and the other\ncomponents of the Project, i.e., those related to capacity building, have no or minimal adverse\nimpacts on the environment. Consultants for the ADB-financed TAs 2629 (footnote 3) and 3256\n(footnote 4) conducted an initial environmental examination (IEE) for the Government and\nexecuting agency. Based on the IEE, no environmental impact assessment is needed for the\nProject. The Project is classified as Environment Category B, and the summary IEE is attached\nas Appendix 10.\n83. Environmental impacts associated with the construction of access roads, power stations,\nsubstations, etc. are expected to be small, and consist of dust and noise during construction,\nand a risk of fuel oil spillage during operation. The new generators will be equipped with exhaust\ngas silencers to reduce noise levels to below 100 decibels at the plant and 40 decibels at a\ndistance of 200 meters. Provided maintenance schedules are adhered to, this level will be\nmaintained for the life of the plant. Concerning air pollution, the diesel engines will be specified\nto  conform  to  accepted  international  standards  for  maximum  concentrations  of  carbon\nmonoxide,  nitrogen  oxide,  and  particulates.  As  part  of  the  turnkey  contract,  operators  will\nreceive training by the manufacturers on monitoring emissions and taking corrective measures,\nif  they  are  required.  Noise  and  air  pollution  caused  by  the  new  generators  will  remain\nsubstantially below the levels from the existing plants. The rehabilitation of the distribution\nfacilities  may  cause  minor  environmental  impacts.  However,  sufficient  precautions  and\nmitigation measures will be taken. In particular, when old transformers are replaced, the oil will\nbe  tested  for  the  presence  of  toxic  polychlorinated  biphenyl  (PCB).  If  PCBs  are  present,\ndisposal will be done in a strictly controlled and acceptable way such as incineration at a very\nhigh  temperature.  Transformer  oil  containing  PCBs  must  be  thermally  destroyed  at  a\ntemperature above 1,300 degrees Celsius. As such an incinerator is not available in Cambodia,\nPCB-contaminated transformer oil will be transported in appropriate containers, either to a\ncement factory in Cambodia where it can be burned in the kiln or to a neighboring country with\nsuitable facilities. In the former case, the kiln temperature should be maintained above 1,300\ndegrees Celsius at all times while the oil is being burned, and in the latter case, the oil should be\nexported in accordance with the provisions of the Basel Convention. Provided that all the\nmitigation measures are implemented as specified in the IEE report, the adverse environmental\nimpacts will be reduced to a minimal level. An environment unit established in EDC will be\nresponsible for implementing and monitoring the environmental management plan.\n2. Social Analysis\n84. The Project will improve access to a reliable electricity supply to residents in the eight\nprovincial capital towns and nearby villages. The beneficiaries will include over 100,000 persons\nin 21,000 households who will receive a superior electricity service for a cost less than the cost\nof supply prevailing at the time of connection.21 Further details of projected tariffs in the project\ntowns are given in Appendix 9. In addition, from 2004-2010, about 70,000 persons in 13,000\n                                                          \n21 Except in Banlung and Prey Veng where current tariffs are below the average for the project towns.", "26\nhouseholds  will  receive  a  power  supply  for  the  first  time.  About  30  percent  of  the  direct\nbeneficiaries are living below the poverty line. The benefits will accrue to the consumers not\nonly in terms of increased opportunity for study and livelihood activities, resulting in increased\ndisposable income, but the towns will become a greater market for products from the rural\nhinterland where living standards will consequently increase. Various sectors of society in each\nof the provincial towns covered by the Project will benefit. For households and businesses that\nare already connected to a central supply, the service will be much improved, i.e., to 24-hour\ncoverage, improved voltage levels, and reduced interruptions in supply. These improvements\nwill increase the life of household appliances and hence reduce the cost of replacements. These\nfactors will also be an incentive for businesses to invest in more productive equipment and spur\neconomic growth.\n85. Based on site visits and interviews, only minimal resettlement impacts are expected to\nresult from the Project. The installation of a new power plant in Sisophon will require the\nresettlement of four households (26 people). The compensation for loss of land and buildings\nwill follow the resettlement plan agreed to by the Government and ADB (para. 108[xii]). New\npower plants and substations in the other seven provincial towns will not result in resettlement\nimpacts. Generator noise and pollution are not expected to cause resettlement impacts, or\nhealth or nuisance problems due to the (i) adequate distance between households in the area\nand the proposed sites for power plants; (ii) installation of lower noise, less-polluting generators;\nand (iii) appropriate construction or rehabilitation of power plant buildings.\n86. The installation of small indoor distribution substations (5 meters by 5 meters), pole-\nmounted distribution substations, and transmission lines is not expected to cause resettlement\nimpacts at any of the sites, as this infrastructure will be located in the right-of-way along existing\nroads. The precise location along roads for the small indoor distribution substations has not yet\nbeen determined, but site visit findings suggest that ample areas exist for installing these\nsubstations without affecting households or businesses.\n87. Private operators who are licensed by MIME are aware that their licenses will not be\nrenewed when the project facilities are installed. Suppliers operating without a license will close\nas their customers avail of the new improved service. These operators will be given about two\nyears notice of the coming Project, ample time for them to relocate or close their operations.\nTheir current investments in generation are likely to be fully depreciated by 2003, if not well\nbefore that time. Finally, as indicated by the largest producer in Stung Treng, some suppliers\nare looking to leave the business due to profitability problems associated with the current high\nprice of diesel fuel. Staff of these operators will be given preference in employment by EDC at\nthe project power plants (para. 108[xii]).\n88. Indigenous  people  and  ethnic  minorities  in  the  project  areas  will  not  be  adversely\naffected  by  the  Project.  Mainstream  Khmer  and  Chinese,  Vietnamese,  Lao,  and  Cham\nminorities  live  in  the  project  areas.  Banlung  and  Stung  Treng  urban  districts  also  have  a\nsubstantial  proportion  of  hill  tribe  ethnic  minorities.  Among  the  five  ethnic  minority  groups\nidentified, the Chinese, who are heavily concentrated in urban centers, hold a controlling share\nof  Cambodian  business  activities  and  are  expected  to  benefit  more  substantially  from  the\nelectricity supply than the mainstream Khmer population. The Moslem Cham constitute a small\nminority (2-6 percent) in most of the eight urban districts with a relatively strong concentration\nalong the coast near Kampot. In the province of Rattanakiri, hill tribes include the Tum Boun,\nKarchak, Proeuv, and Lunn who are seminomadic; many are among the poorest in Cambodia.\nSince  the  Project  will  not  adversely  affect  the  ethnic  minorities,  an  indigenous  people\u2019s\ndevelopment plan is not necessary.", "27\nV.  PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA.  Economic and Financial Analyses\n1.  Subproject Selection\n89. The  eight  project  towns  were  selected  from  a  longer  list  of  candidates  based  on\nquantitative and qualitative criteria. The criteria were accessibility and the prevailing security\nsituation, existence of conditions favorable to economic growth and job creation, proportion of\nexisting  population  engaged  in  nonagricultural  employment,  cost  per  kW  of  new  installed\ncapacity,  cost  per  consumer  connection,  environmental  impact,  comments  of  potential\nstakeholders, and benefits for ethnic minorities. In terms of development potential, the towns\nwere ranked in descending order as follows: Sisophon, Kampong Speu, Kampot, Svay Rieng,\nTakeo, Prey Veng, Banlung, and Stung Treng.\n2.  Load Forecast\n90. The load forecast is fundamental to project planning. The load growth in the project\ntowns  is  one  of  the  major  decisive  factors  for  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution\nplanning,  and  therefore  has  a  decisive  impact  on  the  investment  costs  required  for  the\nrehabilitation of the power systems in each town. Load forecast also has a major impact on the\neconomic  and  financial  feasibility  of  these  investments.  Details  of  the  load  forecast  are\ndescribed in Appendix 11, and are summarized in this section. The load forecast is based on a\nmodel that forecasts sales in three consumer categories: residential, commercial and industrial,\nand public offices and schools.\n91. The residential consumer group is the largest, and accounts for about 70 percent of total\nsales in most towns. The Project will replace the distribution systems in the towns and extend\nservice to outlying communities around each town within 1 or 2 km. The total number of\nresidential  consumers  will  increase  by  about  20  percent  as  a  result  of  rehabilitation  and\nextension of the distribution systems. In addition, the number of customers will increase due to\npopulation growth; and sales per customer will increase due to income growth and to relief of\nsupply-side constraints, currently a problem in many towns. Separate forecasts were prepared\nfor each town. Commercial and industrial sales are typically about 20 percent of total sales in\nthe provincial towns, and are forecast to grow about 9-10 percent annually due to general\neconomic growth. Sales for public sector offices, buildings, and street lighting constitute the\nbalance of about 10 percent of sales. Sales will grow with general economic growth, and a one-\ntime increase when the Project is commissioned due to improved street lighting. Total electricity\nsales are expected to increase by about 133 percent from 1999 until 2004, the first full year of\nproject operation, and by about 10.7 percent annually thereafter.\n92. The increase in total generation required when the Project is commissioned will be less,\ndue to the sharp reduction in distribution losses, from an average 46 percent at present to about\n18 percent after rehabilitation. The high current levels of losses are based on statistics on total\ngeneration and sales in 1999. The forecast losses after rehabilitation are based on actual\nexperience in the towns of Sihanoukville and Siem Riep, which were rehabilitated in 1998 under\nthe first ADB-financed Power Rehabilitation Project, and where average losses in 1999 after\nrehabilitation were reduced to about 18 percent. In 2004, when the Project begins operation, the\ntotal generation demand in the eight towns covered by the Project is expected to be about\n18,100 MWh, with a peak annual load of about 5.6 MW. This is about 54 percent higher than\ntotal generation in 1999.", "28\n3.  Least Cost Analysis\n93. The plans for development and expansion of power supplies under this Project include\ncomplete  replacement  of  the  distribution  systems  in  seven  of  the  eight  towns,  and  the\nconstruction of new diesel power plants or transmission interconnections to larger grid systems.\nAt present all of these towns are isolated from any interconnected grid. The distribution systems\nare generally in very poor condition. Voltage levels of the medium voltage distribution lines are\ntoo low for modern utility designs, and will all be upgraded and standardized at 22 kV for the\nnew systems. Distribution losses are very high, typically about 35-50 percent. The only practical\nway to reduce losses and to serve future growth is to replace these old distribution systems\ncompletely  and  implement  new  management  systems.  Only  Banlung  has  a  satisfactory\ndistribution system, which just needs expansion.\n94. For isolated power systems of this size, the least costly form of independent bulk power\nsupply is diesel power generation. Transmission interconnections with larger power systems\nwere also considered wherever feasible. Kompong Speu will be interconnected with Phnom\nPenh. For Takeo, a transmission interconnection with Phnom Penh was considered but it would\nbe too costly. For Svay Rieng, a 22 kV transmission interconnection to Viet Nam is the least\ncost source of bulk power supply. For Sisophon, the recommended least cost plan is to supply\nload growth with diesel generation initially, and then to connect this town later to a planned\n115 kV transmission interconnection with Thailand. After this interconnection is commissioned,\nthe diesel generating units can be moved to another town.\n4.  Economic and Financial Evaluation\n95. For the economic analysis, the economic benefits of the Project are divided into two parts.\nThe first is the cost saving due to replacing the old and inefficient current power supply systems in\nthe towns. The second is the benefit of additional electricity sales arising from the Project. The\ncost saving due to replacing the current power systems is based on the tariffs that are currently\ncharged  in  each  town.  These  tariffs  are  just  adequate  to  cover  their  operating  costs,  but\ndepreciation is either neglected or very minimal, and interest charges are always ignored.\n96. Residential consumers use electricity primarily for lighting, and to a lesser extent for\ntelevision,  radios,  fans,  and  other  electrical  appliances.  However,  electricity  is  not  used  for\ncooking,  since  it  is  much  more  costly  than  firewood  or  kerosene.  The  additional  electricity\nconsumption for residential consumers is valued on the basis of the average willingness to pay for\nelectricity based on a demand versus price curve that was derived from data for various towns in\nCambodia. The resulting average economic benefit of residential consumption is estimated to be\n$0.35 per kWh.\n97. Commercial and small industrial consumers, and public buildings, which account for about\n30 percent of total energy sales in provincial towns, use electricity for lighting, refrigeration and air-\nconditioning, mechanical drives, and other applications. In the absence of public electricity supply,\nsmall diesel generator sets are used to meet their power requirements. The weighted average of\ncurrent tariffs and alternative economic costs of self-generation is estimated to be $0.26 per kWh\nin economic prices.\n98. The economic evaluation of each of the eight towns included in the Project is described in\nAppendix  11.  The  overall  Project  has  an  estimated  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of\n17.8 percent for the base case. However, the economic evaluation of benefits is conservative, as\nno attempt was made to evaluate the benefits of improved reliability and quality of power supply,", "29\nand cost savings to many individual consumers who require standby private generating sets now\nto ensure reliable power.\n99. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the economic performance of the Project is robust for\nmoderate increases in fuel costs or capital costs. The Project can tolerate a large increase in\ncrude oil price up to $44 per barrel, at which point the economic internal rate of return (EIRR)\nreduces to a marginal 12 percent. The project economics are most sensitive to reductions in\nestimated unit benefits or in total energy sales. The Project would switch to becoming uneconomic\nif average benefit rates for new sales were reduced more than 30 percent, based on a minimum\n12 percent EIRR.\n100. The financial evaluation is based on the financial revenues from electricity sales from the\nProject, starting in 2004. It is assumed that tariffs will be adjusted as shown in Appendix 11. The\naverage planned tariff, three years after project commissioning, will be about 24 percent lower\nthan the existing average tariff, at year 2000 price levels. The average financial internal rate of\nreturn (FIRR) for the overall Project is estimated to be 4.2 percent, just enough to meet the\nweighted average cost of capital to EDC for the project financing of 4.1 percent. Therefore, the\nFIRR for this Project is satisfactory.\nB.  Impact on Poverty\n101. After  two  decades  of  civil  unrest  and  conflict  in  the  1970s  and  1980s,  poverty  is\npervasive in Cambodia. In 1999, the Government estimated the poverty line at KR240,000\n($62.52) per month per household (consisting of an average of 5.3 persons), i.e., $0.39 per\nperson per day for the urban areas other than Phnom Penh. This was the income required to\nbuy food of an average energy intake of 2,100 calories per person per day and a minimum of\nnonfood items, and is well below the international standard of $1 per person per day. According\nto  the  1999  national  census,  the  average  monthly  household  income  in  Cambodia  was\nKR484,000, equivalent to $126. Appendix 12 (Table A12.1) shows the average household\nincome by sector of employment in the project areas.\n102. The average monthly household income in the eight towns ranges from KR322,000 to\nKR597,000  (equivalent  to  $0.51  to  $0.97  per  person  per  day).  Within  each  town  and\nemployment sector, income levels vary widely but about 30 percent of the population in the\nproject  towns  are  living  below  the  poverty  line.  This  is  not  significantly  different  from  the\nproportion nationally. However, Table A12.2 in Appendix 12 shows that the incidence of poverty\nin Sisophon and Prey Veng is significantly higher than the national average, so that the Project\nwill have a poverty reduction impact in these towns.\n103. In the project towns, the present electricity tariffs range from KR800 ($0.21) to KR1,600\n($0.41) per kWh apart from Banlung where the tariff is between KR200 ($0.05) and KR400\n($0.10) per kWh (footnote 21). Given an average monthly household income of KR450,000 in\nthe project urban districts and an average residential household consumption of 25 kWh, the\naffordability ratio, i.e., the proportion of household income spent on electricity as a percentage\nof total income is 5.6 percent, which is comparable to other countries at a similar level of\ndevelopment. However, the many households living close to the poverty line are clearly unable\nto afford even the average consumption level. Nevertheless, the quality of light from a 10 W\nfluorescent lamp is so superior to alternative wicklamps, that even poor people are anxious to\nbe connected. If a supply is not available, many are prepared to use car batteries from which\nenergy costs up to $1 per kWh. Poor people are just able to afford one or two 10 W lamps plus\na small black and white television set, which in total consume 8-10 kWh per month. Even at the", "30\nvery high prices being charged in many areas and with an affordability ratio of 5 percent,\nhouseholds with an income as low as KR150,000 per month ($40), i.e., $0.24 per person per\nday, and well below the poverty line could obtain the benefits of an electricity supply if it were\navailable. Extended coverage and average lower tariffs resulting from the Project will make\nelectricity more affordable to a greater number of poor households. To assist new customers\nwith the initial cost of connection, EDC will offer to construct and own the meter and the service\nconnection line for new residential consumers, and will recover this cost through an additional\nmonthly charge.\n104. Without  doubt,  almost  every  household  strives  for  an  electricity  supply  to  facilitate\nchildren\u2019s  study,  and  via  television,  reduce  people\u2019s  isolation  and  make  them  aware  of\nopportunities and their own potential, as well as directly lengthening the productive hours of\ncottage industries. An affordable, reliable, electricity supply has an almost direct impact on\npoverty,  as  defined  by  ADB,22  by  providing  a  direct  means  to  enable  users  to  sustain\nthemselves by their labor, and through information services become empowered to participate\nin making the decisions that shape their lives.\nC.  Risks\n105. The  Project  is  technically  simple  and  straightforward,  and  given  EDC\u2019s  record  on\nprevious loans, the risk of serious cost overruns or implementation delays on the physical\ninfrastructure are considered small. There are risks with the economic outcome of the Project if\nload  demand  does  not  increase  as  forecast  due  to  such  factors  as  political  instability  or\neconomic recession. This risk has been reduced by designing the Project to provide new\ngenerating capacity to meet anticipated load growth for three years after commissioning, i.e,\n2004-2006, at which time, further investment will be required. This approach has limited the\nvalue of assets that will not be fully utilized if demand does not increase as rapidly as expected.\nEconomic viability could also be compromised if loss reductions and efficiency improvements do\nnot materialize as expected. Anticipated improvements are based on actual performance of\nEDC's  systems  at  Sihanoukville  and  Siem  Reap.  With  the  additional  years  of  operating\nexperience by the date of commissioning, EDC should exceed the expected improvement\nlevels.\n106. The economic analysis has been based on an estimated crude oil price of $20 per barrel\nin 2004, which is slightly higher than the latest World Bank forecast. With higher fuel prices,\ntariffs can be raised to maintain EDC\u2019s income at a level to meet the financial covenants, but\nwith the risk that tariffs become unaffordable to poorer consumers and that demand in all\nsectors will be reduced. However, the Project will become uneconomic if crude oil prices rise\nabove about $44 per barrel.\n107. There  is  a  risk  that  the  capacity  building  components  will  not  fully  achieve  their\nobjectives. Their success depends on recruiting suitable staff, motivating them to learn new\nskills, and retaining them within the organization for a suitable period after training. EDC, as an\nindependent company, is able to set attractive remuneration levels that up to now have enabled\nit to retain suitable staff.

This appendix provides a brief description of the economic significance of each of the\neight provincial towns covered by the Provincial Power Supply Project. Information is also\nprovided on the potential beneficiaries of the Project; beneficiaries include the population of the\nprovincial towns who will gain access to electricity, or will benefit from a more reliable electricity\nsupply.  By  improving  the  reliability  of,  and  access  to,  electricity,  the  Project  will  play  an\nimportant role in increasing economic growth and the standard of living in each of the eight\ntowns. Data on the existing electricity systems is given in Table A4.\nA. Banlung\n2. Banlung, the capital of Rattanakiri province, is located in northeastern Cambodia about\n400 kilometers (km) from Phnom Penh. The province\u2019s economy is highly dependent on the\nagriculture sector, including cash crops such as rubber and wood processing for flooring and\nwall cladding. Plans for additional cash crop plantations, such as palm oil, are being considered\nfor the future.\n3. Banlung has a population of 11,256 (2,095 households), compared with a total of 94,243\npeople living in Rattanakiri province. About 60 percent of Banlung households have access to\nelectricity, while 40 percent of households depend on kerosene, batteries, and other sources to\nserve lighting and electrical needs. Banlung is served by a 1 megawatt (MW) hydropower plant,\nfinanced by grant aid and commissioned in 1993. Of the provincial towns under consideration\nfor the Project, Banlung has the largest population of ethnic minorities, primarily hill tribes such\nas the Kachak, Tum Boun, and Lunn. Although the census does not collect information on\nethnicity, census information on religion can serve as a useful proxy since most Khmer people\nare Buddhist, most Cham people are Muslim, and most hill tribe people\u2019s religion would fall\nunder the census category of \u201cother.\u201d  In Banlung, about 70 percent of the population is\nBuddhist, 26 percent is \u201cother,\u201d and 3 percent is Muslim.\n4. In  Banlung  there  are  11  schools,  18  administrative  offices,  one  post  and\ntelecommunication office, one health center, 32 workshops, about 50 shops, and three hotels.\nB. Kampot\n5. The city of Kampot is the capital of Kampot province and is located about 150 km\nsouthwest of Phnom Penh on the banks of the river Chhou. The city is located on the railway\nline  from  Phnom  Penh  to  Sihanoukville.  Kampot  town  has  a  population  of  32,200\n(6,060 households),  compared  with  the  province\u2019s  total  population  of  528,405  people.  The\nelectrification ratio is estimated by the Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy (MIME) to be\nabout 60 percent.\n6. Kampot is considered as an important tourist center being close to the seaside town of\nKep and to Bokor village, which is located near the Phnom Popok Mountain (with an altitude of\n1,080 meters). During the weekends, the town is frequented by people from Phnom Penh who\nseek relaxation from the capital. This has led to new investment during the last couple of years\nin the commercial sector and has improved the supply in the service sector considerably.\n7. On the commercial side, Kampot has seven hotels, some with more than 40 rooms,\naround 10 guest-houses, and about 50 restaurants. The town has three petrol stations and\nmore than 40 workshops and manufacturing establishments, among them four ice factories and", "42\nAppendix 4, page 2\nabout 10 wood workshops. There are about 600 handicraft centers and cottage industries in and\naround the city. Along the river, some shipyards build wooden ships. In the public sector, there\nare  more  than  30  government  and  administrative  offices,  among  them  a  post  and\ntelecommunication office and a police station. There are, in addition, nine schools and five\nhospitals/health centres.\n8. Kampot town is known to be home to a significant number of Cham people. This is\nsupported by census information, which estimates that 11 percent of the people in Kampot town\nare Muslim, the religion of the Cham people. The remainder of Kampot town\u2019s population are\npracticing Buddhists.\n9. The city of Kep is located about 20 km southeast of Kampot and prior to the civil war\nwas  an  important  tourist  area.  The  intention  of  the  authorities  is  to  promote  Kep  as  a\ntourist resort. The population in 1997 was around 10,000 people. Future development in this\ntown is likely to lie mainly in the tourism sector. At present, not much economic development is\nto be observed in Kep. A transmission line existed between the two towns before the civil war\n(1970-1975). Some of the old transmission poles are still in place, but there are no connectors\nand  insulators.  The  Project  will  include  a  check  on  the  feasibility  of  extending  the  new\ndistribution system to supply Kep.\nC. Kompong Speu\n10. Kompong Speu is the capital of Kompong Speu province and is located about 48 km\nsouthwest of Phnom Penh on National Road No. 4 on the route to the city of Sihanoukville. The\ncity has a population of 30,250 in 5,500 households. The river Prek Thnot divides the city in two\nparts, the northern part is less populated. Altogether there are five communities, of which four\nhave  about  the  same  population  (around  5,000)  and  one  is  larger.  The  city  was  almost\ncompletely destroyed during the civil war, and approximately 90 percent of the original town has\nbeen reconstructed. The population of the whole province of Kompong Speu is just above half a\nmillion.\n11. Kompong Speu town is the only one of the selected towns that currently has no public\npower supply system. The old power station had existed before the civil war stopped operation\nduring the war; none of the remaining equipment is serviceable. The installed capacity before\nthe war was in the range of 1 MW. Before the war the majority of the houses were connected to\nthe  electric  grid.  Today  power  generation  and  distribution  is  organized  by  seven  private\nsuppliers who operate their systems completely independently of the Provincial Cabinet of\nIndustry, Mines and Energy.\n12. The town has a busy market in the center; two hotels; a number of restaurants, amongst\nthem four larger ones; and nine petrol stations (as a pass-through place on the main road to\nSihanoukville).  Kompong  Speu  has  about  200  manufacturing  establishments  (including\nhandicrafts), including 73 rice mills and two ice factories. Kompong Speu town has about 10\nschools, a post-telecommunication office, a police station, and two health centers. For local\ndevelopment  and  social  projects  about  10  nongovernment  organization  (NGO)  offices  are\nlocated in the town. According to census data, about half of the town\u2019s economically active\npopulation  is  engaged  in  the  agriculture  sector,  while  the  other  half  is  employed  in\nmanufacturing, construction, retail, and services. MIME estimates indicate that about 40 percent\nof households have access to electricity. Lighting for the remaining 60 percent is produced by\nkerosene or batteries.", "43\nAppendix 4, page 3\nD. Prey Veng\n13. Prey Veng town, the capital of Prey Veng province, is located on a floodplain east of the\nMekong River in southeastern Cambodia about 90 km east of Phnom Penh. Prey Veng town\u2019s\nfloodplain location is suitable for rice production, on which the economy is highly dependent.\nCensus findings bear this out; about 94 percent of Prey Veng town\u2019s economically active\npopulation is employed in agriculture and/or fisheries.\n14. Prey Veng urban area has a population of 55,050 (10,918 households), compared with\nthe  overall  population  in  the  province  of  946,042.  According  to  MIME  data,  only  about\n17 percent of Prey Veng town\u2019s population has access to electricity, with the remainder of the\npopulation depending on kerosene and batteries to power light sources and other electrical\nappliances (e.g., fans, televisions). About 35 percent of Prey Veng town\u2019s households are\nheaded by women, the highest proportion in the eight project towns.\n15. The commercial and industrial base in Prey Veng is more limited than in other towns at\nsimilar distances from Phnom Penh. There are 20 rice mills in the town, which process the rice\ngrown in the area. Other manufacturing establishments comprise three ice factories and about\n30 workshops (metal, wood, etc.). There are four petrol stations in Prey Veng, one hotel, two\nguest-houses, and a handful of restaurants. The establishment of food processing plants can be\nseen as an option for the future.\n16. In the public sector, there are six schools, two hospitals, a police station, and a post and\ntelecommunication office. There is also an army camp in the town. Moreover, Prey Veng has\nsome 25 government and administrative offices plus a small number of NGOs and international\naid  agencies,  among  them  the  European  Union  and  the  German  Agency  for  Technical\nCooperation. Both these organizations operate projects outside Prey Veng town.\nE. Sisophon\n17. Sisophon is the provincial capital of Banteay Meanchey province. The town is located\nabout 400 km northwest of Phnom Penh and can be reached via National Road No. 5 or by air\nvia the town of Battambang and then the remaining part via National Road No. 5. Sisophon\u2019s\neconomy is mainly dependent on agriculture; census data indicate that 55 percent of the town\u2019s\neconomically active population is employed in agriculture. However, it's location at the junction\nof national roads No. 5 and No. 6, and it's close proximity to the cities of Battambang (80 km)\nand  Siem  Reap  (100  km),  make  it  an  important  center  for  trade  between  Cambodia  and\nThailand. Indeed, much of the commerce in Sisophon is conducted in Thai baht.\n18. Sisophon  has  a  population  of  98,848  (18,374  households),  compared  with  a  total\npopulation in Banteay Meanchey province of 577,772. According to census statistics, only about\n18 percent of Sisophon\u2019s households have access to electricity. Lighting for the remainder of\nhouseholds is generated using kerosene or batteries. The commercial sector consists of nine\nhotels, five restaurants, 156 workshops, five ice factories, seven petrol stations, 10 carpenters,\nand about 50 smaller shops. The public sector consists of 23 schools, 26 administrative offices,\none post office, one health center, 15 temples, and 15 NGOs.\n19. Power is provided the whole day partly by a public power station and to a greater extent\nby  some  private  power  producers.  All  consumers  have  electric  meters.  Virtually  all  larger\ncommercial establishments have their own diesel generator sets. The health center is the\ndistrict hospital with a staff of 70 and about 50 beds. At present, no electricity is provided to the", "44\nAppendix 4, page 4\nhospital due to nonpayment of bills. Sometimes, friends and relatives of patients bring small\nquantities, e.g., 10 litres, of diesel fuel to enable the hospital to operate the 35 kVA stand-by\ndiesel generator.\nF. Stung Treng\n20. Stung Treng town, the capital of Stung Treng province, is located on the Mekong River\nin northeastern Cambodia about 250 km northeast of Phnom Penh. The province\u2019s economy is\nhighly dependent on agriculture and (until a recent logging ban) logging. Stung Treng town\u2019s\nelectricity is currently supplied by a private producer and tariffs are exceptionally high\u2014KR1,500\nper kW for all consumers compared with KR350 per kWh in Phnom Penh for low-use domestic\ncustomers. According to government officials in Stung Treng, nearly all of the town\u2019s 1,350\nelectricity customers are domestic users.\n21. The total population of the province is in the range of 70,000. The commercial and\nindustrial basis of Stung Treng is agriculture and timber. There are five petrol stations and two\nice  making  factories.  In  the  public  sector  there  are  35  administrative  offices,  a  post  and\ntelecommunication  office,  two  health  centers,  nine  schools,  and  a  large  market.  Most\nbusinesses and hotels have their own generators because it is currently more economical. If\nelectricity tariffs decreased, these businesses would begin using power from the grid rather than\ntheir own generators.\nG. Svay Rieng\n22. Svay Rieng, the capital of the province Svay Rieng, is located about 125 km southeast\nof Phnom Penh and 45 km from the Vietnamese border along national road No. 1. Svay Rieng\nhas a population of 21,205 with 4,112 households. The province has a total population of\napproximately 478,000 and an area of 4,883 square kilometers; 2,156 consumers (houses,\noffices, workshops, and restaurants) are connected to the public electricity grid and all of them\nhave electricity meters.\n23. Due to its proximity to the Vietnamese border and therefore its status as a transit town,\nSvay Rieng has a slightly more developed commercial sector than other towns of similar size.\nThere are, for example, two big hotels; in addition, there are three guest-houses and a number\nof restaurants. Svay Rieng has six petrol stations. The town hosts about 40 manufacturing\nestablishments, among which are 11 rice mills and four ice factories. The development of food\nprocessing plants can be seen as an option for the future.\n24. In the public sector, there are seven schools, one post and telecommunication office,\none police station, a large hospital with a staff of more than 300, a health center and an army\ncamp. There are more than 60 government and other administrative offices, and a number of\nNGOs.\n25. According to census information, about 75 percent of the town\u2019s economically active\npopulation is employed in manufacturing, construction, retail, and services, while 25 percent of\nthe population is involved in agriculture. Trade activity in Svay Rieng town is likely to increase in\nthe near future following completion of national road No. 1 improvement, which will increase the\nspeed and reliability of transport. MIME data indicate that 52 percent of Svay Rieng town\u2019s\nhouseholds have access to electricity, while the remainder depends on kerosene and batteries\nto power lighting sources and other electrical appliances. Although a significant number of Svay\nRieng town\u2019s population are likely to be of Vietnamese descent, it is not possible to estimate the", "45\nAppendix 4, page 5\nproportion of Vietnamese in the population using the religion proxy method because the main\nreligion practiced by both Vietnamese and Khmer people is Buddhism.\nH. Takeo\n26. Takeo is the capital of Takeo province and is located about 70 km south of Phnom Penh:\nit can be reached via National Road No. 2. The city has a population of 25,437 in 4,799\nhouseholds. The population of the entire province is about 700,000. Takeo town has an area of\n135 square kilometres. Takeo town\u2019s economy depends on agriculture, but perhaps due to its\nclose proximity to Phnom Penh, Takeo has five hotels, a number of public guesthouses and\neight  restaurants.  There  are  four  petrol  stations  in  town.  There  are  17  manufacturing\nestablishments  in  Takeo,  including  ice  factories  and  rice  mills.  Future  development  plans\ninclude a slaughterhouse, a new hotel, and another rice mill. Takeo has nine primary schools, a\nsecondary school, and four other schools. There are two hospitals/health centers, a post and\ntelecommunication office, two police stations, and an army camp. There are more than 30 of\ngovernment and other administrative offices. Recently, Electricit\u00e9 du Cambodge took over the\nelectricity system, which serves about 300 consumers.\n27. The town of Angtassom is a significant population center about 12 km to the east of\nTakeo. It is located at the junction of national roads No. 2 and No. 3. Angtassom has a total of\n581 households. As Angtassom is served by a private generator that provides the distribution\nsystem to local premises, the approach of the MIME is to connect Angtassom from Takeo\nthrough an overhead line. This was the case before the civil war, and around 70 to 80 percent of\nthe old concrete towers between the two towns could still be used for a new transmission line.\nHowever, all the conductors and the insulators are missing.", "Table A4:  Existing Electricity Systems in the Project Towns\nItem Unit Banlung Kampot Kompong Prey Veng Sisophon Stung Svay Rieng Takeo &\nSpeu Treng Angtassom\nPopulation No 11,256 34,200 30,250 55,050 98,800 24,093 21,205 27,750\nHouseholds No 2,095 6,230 5,500 10,918 18,374 4,426 4,112 5,380\nAverage income $/p/d 0.85 1.06 0.73 0.55 0.53 0.93 1.01 0.67\nElectrification Ratio % 60 59 41 17 18 30 52 42\nDistribution  System\nMIME/EDC household 1,200 3,700 400 1,822 1,300 0 2,156 2,240\nPrivate household 60 None 1,850 None 1,950 1,350 None 0\nMV system 10 kV 6.3 and 15 LV only 15 LV only LV only 15 6.3 and 15\nCondition Good Very poor Poor Poor N/A Poor OK S/S are poor\nGenerating System\nInstalled\nMIME/EDC kW 1,020 240 0 584 0 0 1,000 900a\nPrivate kW 0 1,320 585 0 2,275 700 650 0\nAvailable\n4\nMIME kW 102 0 0 460 0 0 0 600 6\nPrivate kW 0 1,320 435 0 ? 560 500 0\nEstimated Peak Demand kW <300b 910 466 340 565 114 500 540\nGeneration (1999) MWh 1,293 2,793 1,632 757 1,145 318 1,603 1,155\nLosses % 73 45 35 44 45 46 50 42\nTariffs\nResidential  $/kwh 0.052 0.270 0.315 0.235 0.410 0.390 0.234 Tak:0.226    AT:0.415\nCommercial $/kwh 0.104 0.270 0.315 0.235 0.310 0.390 0.234 Tak:0.226    AT:0.415\nIndustrial $/kwh 0.160 0.270 0.315 0.235 0.360 0.390 0.234 Tak:0.226    AT:0.415\n      MIME = Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy.\n        a Private producers shut down in early 2000.

The consolidated statements reflect EDC\u2019s main\noperation in Phnom Penh, its branches in Kompong Cham, Siem Reap, Sihanoukville, and the\neight provincial towns under the proposed Project. The projected financial statements are in\ncurrent  terms.  Domestic  inflation  is  assumed  at  7  percent,  and  international  inflation  at\n2.4 percent. The exchange rate being used as the base for 2000 is KR3,800 to $1.00, which\nwas  adjusted  during  the  forecast  period  based  on  the  differential  between  the  assumed\ndomestic and international inflation rates.\nB. Income Statement (Table A9.1)\n1.  Electricity Sales\n2. Electricity sales are expected to increase from 284 gigawatt-hour (GWh) in 1999 to\n840 GWh by 2007. Sales are forecast to grow at 19 percent in 2000, 16 percent in 2001 and\n2002, 13 percent in 2003, 15 percent in 2004, and 12 percent from 2005 onward. Out of the total\nsales, the Phnom Penh operation accounts for more than 90 percent. The Project for the eight\nprovincial towns will be largely completed by 2003 and it is assumed that the first full year of\noperation will start in 2004. Sales from the 8 provincial towns account for less than 4.0 percent of\nEDC\u2019s total sales.\n2. System Losses\n3. The level of system losses used to derive sales for each year was 20 percent in 2000, 19\npercent in 2001, 18 percent in 2002, and 17 percent in 2003 thereafter. For each of the eight\nprovincial towns, system losses were assumed at 18 percent per annum throughout the projected\nperiod.\n3. Fuel Cost\n4. Depending on its generators, EDC uses either light diesel oil or heavy fuel oil, the costs of\nwhich were assumed at $446.7 per ton and $263.5 per ton respectively for 2000. These costs\ninclude 10 percent VAT and were estimated based on the assumed international crude oil price of\n$28 per barrel (bbl) in 2000. In accordance with Government instructions, VAT is not added to\nelectricity bills. The resulting cost per kilowatt-hour (kWh) generated for each of EDC generators\nin 2000 is:  C2\u2013$0.091/kWh, C3\u2013$0.0956/kWh, C5\u2013$0.0951/kWh, and C6\u2013$0.0725/kWh (Note:\nC2 is a steam plant using heavy fuel oil and C6 has combustion engines that use heavy fuel oil).\nThe fuel costs for subsequent years are projected to move in line with the international crude oil\nprice, which was projected at $28/bbl in 2000, $25/bbl in 2001, $21/bbl in 2002, and at $20/bbl\nfrom 2003 onwards.\n4.  Purchased Power\n5. EDC  purchases  power  from  two  independent  power  producers  (IPPs)  now  and  will\npurchase power from the Kirirom Hydroplant and from Viet Nam from 2004 and thereafter as\ndetailed here:", "55\nAppendix 9, page 2\n(i)  IPP-1,  37.1  megawatt  (MW)  burning  heavy  fuel  oil.  A  joint  venture  of\nLeader Universal Holdings Bhd./Delcom Service/Intercore signed a power\npurchase  agreement  (PPA)  for  18  years  on  September  15,  1994.\nCommercial operations commenced in 1997. The capacity charge is $4.83\nper kW per month based on an 83 percent plant factor. Energy costs are\nfixed at $0.0427/kWh plus fuel costs. For 2000, EDC was being charged\nabout $0.1233/kWh.\n(ii)  IPP-2, diesel plant. A short-term PPA has been negotiated with Jupiter\nPower Cambodia Co. Ltd. The cost of power from this plant, which varies\nwith fuel cost, is currently estimated at $0.1398 based on fuel price of\n$446.7 per ton.\n(iii)  Kirirom Hydro Plant: the purchase price will be $0.07/kWh for the first\n12 years.\n(iv)  Imported power from Viet Nam, up to 200 MW, will be at an average cost\nof $0.06/kWh plus $0.01/kWh as transmission cost.\n5.  Operating and Other Expenses.\n6.  Operation  and  maintenance  has  three  components:    (i)  variable  costs  (lube  oil  and\nspares) at KR48 per kWh of EDC generation, (ii) a fixed cost of 2 percent of revalued gross fixed\nassets in service, and (iii) a provision for unusual expenditure.\n7.  Provision for bad debt was estimated at 2 percent of total electricity sales per year. Salary\nand wages for 2000 are based on their 1999 level, and increased by the assumed inflation rate.\nAll these costs are assumed to increase in line with domestic inflation.\n6.  Depreciation\n8. Gross fixed assets have been depreciated based on an average 20 year economic life\n(i.e., at the rate of 5 percent per annum).\n7. Foreign Exchange Losses\n9. Losses due to devaluation of the Riel are expensed each year based on the difference\nbetween the international and domestic inflation rates at 2.4 percent and 7.0 percent respectively.\n8. Income Taxes\n10. Income tax on profit has been assessed at 4 percent of net profits. Where there are no\nprofits, a minimum tax of 1 percent of sales is applied.\n9. Dividends\n11. It has been assumed that EDC will pay as much dividend as possible while maintaining a\nself-financing ratio of at least 30 percent.", "56\nAppendix 9, page 3\nC. Balance Sheet (Table A9.2)\n1. Assets Revaluation\n12. Revaluation  of  fixed  assets  and  provision  for  depreciation  are  based  on  the\nmanufacturers\u2019 unit value (MUV) price index for foreign costs and domestic inflation of 7 percent\nper annum. The annual revaluation factor applied being 6.8 percent per annum\n2.  Accounts Receivable and Accounts Payable\n13. Accounts receivable are forecast at three months of sales for 2001 onward. The targets\nindicated for the accounts receivable collection period are set as covenants for the ADB loan.\nAccounts payable are forecast at three months of total fuel and power purchases.\n3.  Inventories and other current assets\n14. The forecast is based on 2.5 percent of net fixed assets in operation and cash operating\nexpenses.\n4.  Debt Service and Borrowings\n15. The Government has an existing loan from the World Bank ($21.5 million), which was\nrelent to EDC at 6.5 percent per annum, repayable over 12 years after the five-year grace\nperiod. Repayment will commence in 2002. EDC has another existing loan from the Foreign\nTrade Bank, with a current outstanding balance of $3 million and an interest rate of 15 percent\nper annum. This loan will be fully repaid in 2001. EDC is responsible for the foreign exchange\nrisk of all the foreign currency borrowings. The ADB project loan will be relent to EDC at an\ninterest rate of 3.5 percent, and with EDC carrying the foreign exchange risk. The loan has a\n20-year repayment period including a 5-year grace period. It is assumed that the proposed\nWorld Bank loan for the rural electrification project will be relent to EDC on the same terms and\nconditions as the existing loan. The World Bank loan will have a 12-year repayment period with\nloan repayment to start in 2007. A working capital loan was assumed to be obtained as needed\nfrom the Foreign Trade Bank at 15 percent annual interest rate.\nD.  Cash Flow Statement (Table A9.3)\n1.  Capital Expenditure\n16. Phnom Penh distribution expansion for 2001-2003 for a total cost of $29 million is being\nfinanced  by  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  as  a  grant.  The  World  Bank  rural\nelectrification project to be implemented during 2001-2003 was estimated at $32.4 million. The\nproposed Project, which will be implemented during 2001-2004, has a cost for the infrastructure\ncomponent of about $21 million including taxes, duties, contingencies, and consulting services.\nOther capital expenditures after the completion of all of these projects are for the expansion of\nEDC\u2019s transmission and distribution system.\n2.  Grant and Equity Contribution\n17. Under the World Bank project, the Government is expected to inject some new equity\ninto EDC, to cover the costs not financed under the World Bank loan. For the Project, the\nGovernment will provide EDC, as a capital contribution, the costs not financed by ADB and\nEDC. (Note: Agence Francaise de Developpement is interested in providing partial financing, on\na grant basis for the proposed ADB project, at an amount to be determined.", "Table A9.1: EDC Projected Income Statement - Consolidated Accounts\n(KR billions)\n \nFiscal Year ending 31 December 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007\naudited forecast forecast forecast forecast forecast forecast forecast forecast  \nGeneration (GWh)           374          4 22          4 83          5 55          6 21          7 16           8 03            9 02         1 ,012\nT&D losses  24% 20% 19% 18% 17% 17% 17% 17% 17%\nSales (GWh)           284           337           391           455           515           594            667            7 48             840\nSales Growth n/a 19% 16% 16% 13% 15% 12% 12% 12%\nAverage Revenue (KR/kWh)           521 577 652 700 752 728 730 746 778\nIncrease (Decrease) in Average Revenue (%) a  n/a 11 13 7 8 (3) 0 2 4\nOperating Revenues\nElectricity Sales 147.9 194.7 255.1 318.3 387.5 432.4 486.2 558.0 653.5\nAdd: Connection Fees 12.5 2.0 3.0 6.0 6.0 6.0 6.0 6.0 6.0\n        Other Revenues 1.1 1.1 1.1 1.1 1.1 1.1 1.1 1.1 1.1\nNet Revenue 161.6 197.8 259.2 325.4 394.7 439.5 493.4 565.1 660.6\nOperating Costs\nFuel Cost 46.6 53.8 47.8 58.5 60.7 21.0 22.9 25.0 27.3\nPower Purchase 75.8 120.5 152.9 166.8 210.1 250.1 298.7 357.2 427.6\nOperation and Maintenance 14.2 15.8 17.6 21.6 26.5 23.7 27.5 31.8 37.0\n5\nSalaries & Wages 4.8 5.2 5.5 5.9 6.3 6.8 7.2 7.8 8.3 7\nProvision For Maintenance 0.0 4.0 4.3 4.6 4.9 5.2 5.6 6.0 6.4\nProvision For Bad Debts 1.9 4.0 5.2 6.5 7.9 8.5 9.5 10.9 12.7\nDepreciation 18.9 28.3 30.3 31.0 36.5 44.9 50.0 56.0 62.8\nTotal Operating.

Introduction\n1. The  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  of  the  Project  was  carried  out  by  the\nconsultants under the Asian Development Bank (ADB)-financed technical assistance (TA) 2629\nand  3256  with the  assistance  of  the  Ministry  of  Industry,  Mines  and  Energy  (MIME)  and\nElectricit\u00e9 du Cambodge (EDC), the Executing Agency of the Project. The major component of\nthe  Project,  which  involves  expansion  and  rehabilitation  of  old  electricity  facilities  in  eight\nprovincial towns, has some adverse environmental impacts. The capacity building component\nhas  no  adverse  impacts  on  the  environment.  An  environment  specialist  from  ADB  visited\nCambodia from 22 to 28 July 2000 and inspected a selection of the project sites and the central\nworkshop  of  EDC  with  the  officials  concerned.  The  Project  as  a  whole  is  classified  as\nEnvironment Category B.\nB.  Description of the Project\n2. The Project consists of two components: (i) power system expansion and rehabilitation\nin eight provincial towns, and (ii) capacity building. The detailed description of the Project is\ngiven in Chapter IV of the main text.\nC.  Description of the Environment\n1.  Physical and Ecological Resources\n3. The Cambodian plain, where six of the eight project sites are located, is entirely flat in\nthe areas drained by the Tonle Sap and Mekong rivers, changing only in the north eastern,\nnorth western, and south western fringes to gently rolling to mountainous country. Sisophon is\nlocated in the hill country to the west of Tonle Sap Lake. The Tonle Sap River fills the lake\nduring the rainy season and drains it in dry season. The Cambodian central plain is mostly\ninundated during the rainy season. The soil in the central plain consists mainly of highly fertile\nsilts, and clay loams in some areas, which are suitable for low land rice production. In the\nhighlands around Banlung, rice production is supplemented by upland crops such as maize and\na variety of vegetables.\n4. As the distribution, transmission, and generation sites are either in urban or semi-urban\nareas or along roads with mainly rice fields on either side, the Project's impacts on ecological\nresources,  such  as  forest  biodiversity,  habitat,  and  vulnerable  species,  are  found  to  be\nnegligible.\n5. Although urban administrations in the eight project areas are making great efforts to\nimprove sewage disposal and treatment facilities, their efforts are hampered by budgetary\nconstraints, and sewage disposal remains critical. Drinking water supply is particularly critical in\nmost of the urban centers, as piped water is in short supply and most households rely on dug\nwells and surface water as their main source of drinking water.\n2. Human and Economic Development\n6. The population in the project areas is estimated at about 300,000 or 2.5 percent of the\ntotal population of Cambodia. In the provincial centers, a household comprises on average 5.3\npersons. The population pyramid in the eight urban centers, as a reflection of the war, shows", "65\nAppendix 10, page 2\nthat the number of those aged 20-30 years has been greatly diminished. Also as a result of the\nwar, the proportion of displaced persons continues to be high causing a number of problems\nboth for provincial budgets and the labor market.\n7. The economic infrastructure in all eight urban centers has been greatly affected by the\nwar, and economic recovery is hampered by a lack of investment. After a period of slow growth\nin the two previous years, the Cambodian economy grew by about 4 percent in 1999. According\nto the population census, agriculture is the most important sector of employment in all of the\neight urban centers. Most households in the eight towns use kerosene for lighting, with the\nexception of Banlung, Kampot, and Svay Rieng, where electricity is the main source of lighting,\nwhile  batteries  and  other  sources  account  for  3-5  percent  of  household  energy  supply.\nA majority of households in the project areas use firewood as their main fuel for cooking and a\nsmall percentage use charcoal.\n8. In the project area, health and sanitation conditions are generally poor and, therefore,\nvery sensitive to adverse environmental impacts. In all of the eight urban centers, need to\nrehabilitate not only the electric power system but also all other public services is urgent, as\nprogress in rehabilitating the sewage, water supply, education, transport, and health systems is\nvery slow. Reliable and affordable electricity supplies are essential for attracting business to the\nprovincial centers, which in turn would improve the employment situation and strengthen the\nimpetus for economic recovery.\nD.  Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures\n1.  Preconstruction Stage\n9. Environmental impacts related to project layout, land use, construction, operation and\nmaintenance are considered as insignificant. The standard layout for a power plant with a\nmaximum capacity of 500 kilowatt (kW) involves a power house with a control room and\nworkshop, a fuel storage and water storage facility, a 22 kilovolt (kV) substation, a warehouse,\nan office, and an extension area, altogether requiring a total area of 0.8-1.2 hectares (ha).\nProject design will include the replacement of existing transformers. A major environmental\nimpact can be expected if the transformers contain polychlorinated bi-phenyl (PCB), which is\nhazardous to human health. As the existing transformers were originally supplied from the\nformer Soviet Union, they likely contain PCBs, and special handling procedures are, therefore,\nrequired. Part A of the Project should be carefully designed and thoroughly examined to ensure\nadverse environmental impacts are minimized.\n10.  The  sites  for  the  new  power  stations  and  substations  have  mostly  been  selected.\nIn some cases such as Kompong Speu and Takeo, the existing power stations will be sites for\nnew facilities, which do not require any acquisition of land. In other cases, land has to be\nacquired. The land requirement for the diesel power plants varies from 12,000 square meters for\nSisophon to about 8,000 square meters for the smaller plants.\n11. Appropriate measures should be taken to mitigate adverse impacts on land use, water\nresources, and the ecology. To mitigate the impact on land use, compensation payments will be\nneeded. The draft electricity law, which is before the Council of Ministers and remains to be\nratified by Parliament, stipulates in Article 51 that a licensee may install, over any land, electrical\nfacilities and equipment necessary to satisfy electrical power supply. The draft law also requires\nthat the licensee take reasonable commercial effort to acquire rights of entry, rights of way, and\neasements  through  negotiations  with  the  landowners  by  paying  appropriate  compensation.", "66\nAppendix 10, page 3\nShould the licensee fail to obtain such rights the Electricity Authority of Cambodia (EAC) may\ncertify the acquisition to be in the public interest to enable the relevant Government authority to\nproceed with the compulsory acquisition of the easement or land for the licensee.\n2. Construction Stage\n12. The main problem related to the construction of access roads, power stations, poles,\nand substations is the clearing of vegetation. There may also be temporary interference with\nexisting electricity supply or traffic flow during construction. Other impacts such as dust and\nnoise during construction will be minimal.\n13. Transport  and  storage  of  fuel  involves  several  potentially  adverse  environmental\nimpacts, as oil can leak or spill into the subsoil due to accident or mere neglect. Without\nappropriate safeguards during construction as well as operation, oil spills or leakages may\npollute surface and groundwater resources.\n14. Environmental protection standards require that used oils with PCB content exceeding\n20 milligrams/kilogram (mg/kg) and halogen content exceeding 2 grams/kilogram (g/kg) cannot\nbe processed but must be thermally destroyed in a suitably equipped incinerator. Normally only\nhazardous  waste  incinerators  would  be  considered  as  suitable  for  destruction  of  PCB-\ncontaminated transformer oil, and since there are no such incinerators in Cambodia, PCB-\ncontaminated  transformer  oil  may  have  to  be  transported  to  a  neighboring  country  with\nappropriate facilities. Another option, which would not necessitate the transportation of PCB\ncontaminated oil to a neighboring country, would require directing contaminated transformer oil\nto energy utilization as a secondary fuel in Cambodian cement works. However, this option\nwould only be feasible if the cement work could guarantee the destruction of the PCB pollutants\nby combustion at temperatures over 1,300 degrees Celsius. Due to its potential hazard for the\nenvironment, other processing methods of PCB-contaminated transformer oil are discouraged,\neven though they may be cheaper than the options discussed.\n3. Operation Stage\n15. The main problems due to project operation are noise from diesel generators, emission\nof air pollutants, and hazards associated with fuel handling and power distribution. The noise\nimpact from operating diesel generators will be reduced to acceptable levels by an appropriate\ndesign of the powerhouse and by introducing exhaust gas silencers. Therefore, even if a school\nis in close proximity of the power station, as in the case of Sisophon, the noise level of the\ndiesel generator is not expected to exceed 40 decibels (dB) at 200 m distance, assuming a\nstandard noise emission of 100 dB. Since the noise emissions in existing power stations are\nconsiderable, introducing new generation units that comply with international noise standards\nwill be a major improvement. The noise impact from operating diesel generators will be reduced\nto acceptable levels by appropriate specifications for noise level and power house design.\n16. Air  pollution  due  to  generator  operation  mainly  involves  the  emission  of  carbon\nmonoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and particulates. Emission intensity varies according to the make,\nage and maintenance level of the generator. Nitrogen dioxide and dust pollutants represent a\nhealth hazard, as they can cause irritations of the respiratory tract that can be dangerous if the\nexposure is prolonged.", "67\nAppendix 10, page 4\n17. Concerning air pollution, the new power stations should correspond to the state of the art\nand meet international emission standards. It is recommended that emission standards required\nfor standard compression ignition engines of a maximum concentration of 0.65 g/m3 for carbon\nmonoxide, 2-4 g/m3 for nitrogen dioxide and 0.13 g/m3 for particulates be kept. Operators at the\npower plants need to be trained to ensure that emissions are regularly measured and emission\nstandards are complied with. In this way it can be ensured that air pollution caused by operation\nof  the  new  generators  remains  below  critical  levels.  If  operators  are  properly  trained,  air\npollution caused by the new generators can be expected to remain substantially below the\npresently applicable level.\n18. Protecting  water  sources  from  uncontrolled  oil  spills  and  leakages  are  of  crucial\nimportance, and taking appropriate measures can be expected to greatly improve the existing\nsituation. Measures designed to minimize adverse effects from oil spills and leakages should\ninvolve (i) designing storage facilities according to international standards, (ii) setting proper\nmaintenance standards, and (iii) introducing a system for recycling or disposing of used oil.\nE.  Institutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring Program\n19. The draft electricity law does not propose new environmental protection measures and\nrefrains from listing environmental provisions for either generation, transmission, distribution or\nretailing licenses. Instead, the draft law states, in Article 35 (a), that the licensee must comply\nwith the laws of the Kingdom of Cambodia, including laws regarding environmental protection,\nand in Article 8 (m) that the electricity authority of Cambodia is to give careful consideration to\nenvironmental policies of the Government.\n20. The implementation of mitigating measures should be formalized in an environmental\nmanagement plan or its equivalent. The plan should define the mechanism and responsibilities\nfor  implementing  the  proposed  mitigating  measures  and  for  monitoring  their  effectiveness.\nTo ensure that environmental considerations are included in project design, provisions need to\nbe made to clearly define environmental performance targets or milestones for each one of the\nproposed mitigating measures.\n21. The  monitoring  mechanism  should  also  involve  periodic  ADB  project  review\nmissions, quarterly reports of the environmental management unit or group, as well as both\nquarterly and annual reports. Concerning critical mitigating measures, such as the disposal of\nPCB-contaminated transformer oil, should its existence eventually be proven, periodic audits\nshould  be  carried  out  by  independent  consultants,  to  monitor  progress  and  measure  the\neffectiveness of the recommended measures.\nF.  Findings and Recommendations\n22. Part A of the Project is expected to cause a number of adverse environmental impacts,\nwhich include environmental hazards related to land use, noise, air pollution, water pollution,\nand ecological hazards. However, these impacts are considered insignificant if they are properly\nmitigated in accordance with the environment management plan.\n23.  The recommended mitigation measures should become the basis for an environmental\nmanagement plan to be implemented by EDC in consultation with MIME and the Ministry of\nEnvironment  (MOE),  as  necessary.  The  environmental  management  plan,  if  properly\nimplemented, is expected not only to reduce the environmental impacts to an acceptable level\nbut also to bring about a major improvement in the overall environmental situation as compared", "68\nAppendix 10, page 5\nwith the prevailing situation, as the existing power supply facilities and practices will be phased\nout and replaced by new ones. The recommended mitigating measures are not expected to\nsignificantly affect the Project\u2019s financial and economic viability.\n24.  The  existence  of  PCB-contaminated  transformer  oil,  if  it  should  be  proven,  would\nconstitute  a  critical  problem  for  the  environment  and  needs  to  be  mitigated.  The  Central\nWorkshop of EDC does not have any information on the existence of PCBs nor testing facilities\nfor  detecting  them.  A  short  study  should  be  conducted  to  identify  appropriate  disposal\nprocesses, and to provide conclusive answers as to availability of appropriate incineration\nfacilities in Cambodia and cost effectiveness of incineration in Cambodia compared with the\nalternative  of  disposing  of  PCB  contaminants  in  neighboring  countries  where  they  can  be\neffectively destroyed.\n25.  Provided EDC\u2019s management information systems are significantly upgraded, EDC is\nexpected to be able to implement and monitor the recommended measures. The IEE confirms\nthe findings of the 1998 environmental examination that the Project is environmentally sensitive\nbut that adverse environmental impacts are minimal. The proposed mitigating measures and\nmonitoring program should be adequate to mitigate those adverse impacts.\nG.  Conclusions\n26.  The IEE confirms that adverse environmental impacts are considered insignificant and\ncan  be  mitigated  under  the  environmental  management  plan,  and  that  the  Project  is\nenvironmentally  acceptable.  The  mitigation  measures  need  to  be  closely  monitored  and\nevaluated  by  EDC.  An  additional  study  concerning  the  disposal  of  PCB  contaminants  is\nrequired,  should  its  existence  be  proven.  The  IEE  together  with  the  recommended\nenvironmental management plan and appropriate monitoring and evaluation mechanisms is\nsufficient for the evaluation of the environmental aspects of the Project, and any additional study\non environmental impact assessment is not needed.", "69\nAppendix 11, page 1\nECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSES\nA.  Load Forecast\n1. The load forecast is fundamental to project planning and justification. The load growth in\nthe  different  provincial  towns  is  one  of  the  major  decisive  factors  for  the  generation,\ntransmission, and distribution expansion planning, and therefore has a decisive impact on the\ninvestment costs required to rehabilitate the power systems in the project areas. It also has a\nmajor impact on the economic and financial feasibility of these investments.\n2. The preparation of a reliable load forecast for each of the eight provincial towns in this\nProject was difficult in several cases, due to the impact of supply-side constraints on historic\nrecords of power generation and sales, and the unreliable nature and limited period of these\nrecords. However, historic data on sales and generation was available for several towns, such\nas Kampot and Takeo, where supply-side constraints and self-generation are not significant.\nThe sales records in these towns were used as a basis for estimating average consumption\nrates in other towns that have had supply-side constraints.\n3. The revised final forecast is based on a model that forecasts sales in three consumer\ncategories: residential, commercial and industrial, and public offices and schools. Table A11.1\nshows  the  detailed  load  forecast  for  the  town  of  Kampot  as  an  example.  The  residential\nconsumer group is the largest, and accounts for about 70 to 80 percent of total sales in most\ntowns. The Project will replace the complete distribution systems in the towns, and extend\nservice  to  outlying  communities  around  each  town  (these  extensions  could  be  up  to  two\nkilometers).  The  total  number  of  residential  consumers  is  estimated  to  increase  by  15  to\n20 percent as a result of the rehabilitation and extension of the distribution systems. In addition,\nthe number of customers will increase due to urban population growth of about 2.8 to 3 percent\nannually; and sales per customer will increase about 6 percent annually due to income growth.\nCommercial and industrial sales are typically about 15 to 20 percent of total sales in the\nprovincial towns. Sales to commercial and industrial consumers are forecast to increase about\n9 to 10 percent annually, based on a forecast growth rate in economic activities of about\n7 percent annually, and an energy (electricity demand) elasticity factor of 1.3 to 1.4 against\neconomic growth. Sales for public sector offices, buildings, and street lighting constitute the\nbalance of about 10 percent of sales. Total sales will increase sharply by about 25 percent when\nthe  Project  is  commissioned  in  2003-2004,  due  to  the  increase  in  number  of  residential\nconsumers  and  improved  street  lighting,  and  thereafter  are  forecast  to  increase  at  about\n10.5 percent annually.\n4. However, the increase in total generation required when the Project is commissioned will\nbe much less due to the sharp reduction in losses from 45 percent at present, to a rate of about\n18  percent  after  rehabilitation.  This  will  actually  result  in  a  net  annual  reduction  in  total\ngeneration required when the Project is commissioned. The high current levels of losses are\nbased on statistics on actual total generation and sales in 1999. The forecast losses after\nrehabilitation are based on actual experience in the towns of Siem Riep and Sihanoukville,\nwhich were rehabilitated in 1998 under the first Asian Development Bank (ADB)-financed power\nproject,1  and  where  average  losses  in  1999  after  rehabilitation  were  reduced  to  about\n18 percent. The forecast growth rate of peak loads after 2004 is slightly lower than the forecast\ngrowth rate in energy sales, due to a gradual increase in system load factors from 35 percent at\npresent, to about 40 percent by 2013.\n                  \n1 Loan 1345-CAM(SF):  Power Rehabilitation Project, for $28.2 million, approved on 15 December 1994.", "Table A11.1:  Load Forecast for Kampot\nYear 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010\nResidential Sector\nPopulation growth (%) 3.1 3.0 3.0 3.0 2.9 2.9 2.8 2.8 2.8 2.7 2.7 2.7\nPopulation 34,140 35,173 36,224 37,293 38,379 39,482 40,602 41,739 42,892 44,061 45,245 46,444\nPersons per household / house 5.5 5.5 5.4 5.4 5.4 5.4 5.4 5.3 5.3 5.3 5.3 5.3\nNo. of households / houses 6,230 6,442 6,659 6,881 7,107 7,339 7,575 7,816 8,062 8,313 8,569 8,830\nConnection rate (%) 59 59 59 59 59 71 73 74 75 77 78 80\nNo. of households / houses electrified 3,700 3,826 3,955 4,086 4,221 5,230 5,503 5,785 6,078 6,381 6,695 7,020\nAverage consumption per household (kWh/a) 260 276 292 310 328 348 369 391 414 439 466 494\nTotal residential consumption (kWh) 962,000 1,054,415 1,155,302 1,265,399 1,385,501 1,819,765 2,029,452 2,261,698 2,518,770 2,803,147 3,117,540 3,464,906\nGrowth rate of residential consumption 9.6 9.6 9.5 9.5 31.3 11.5 11.4 11.4 11.3 11.2 11.1\nCommercial and Industrial Sector\nGrowth rate of economic activities (%) 6.0 7.0 7.0 7.0 7.0 7.0 7.0 7.0 7.0 7.0 7.0 7.0\nEnergy elasticity 1.4 1.4 1.4 1.4 1.4 1.35 1.35 1.35 1.35 1.3 1.3 1.3\nTotal commercial consumption (kWh) 361,680 397,125 436,043 478,775 525,695 575,373 629,746 689,257 754,392 823,041 897,938 979,651\nGrowth rate of commercial consumption 9.8 9.8 9.8 9.8 9.5 9.5 9.5 9.5 9.1 9.1 9.1\n7\nPublic Sector 0\nPublic facilities (kWh) 198,528 212,425 227,295 243,205 260,230 278,446 297,937 318,793 341,108 364,986 390,535 417,872\nStreet lighting (kWh) 0 0 0 0 0 30,000 31,500 33,075 34,729 36,465 38,288 40,203\nTotal public consumption (kWh) 198,528 212,425 227,295 243,205 260,230 308,446 329,437 351,868 375,837 401,451 428,823 458,075\nGrowth rate of public consumption (%) 7.0 7.0 7.0 7.0 18.5 6.8 6.8 6.8 6.8 6.8 6.8\nTotal Electricity Consumption (kWh) 1,522,208 1,663,964 1,818,640 1,987,379 2,171,426 2,703,584 2,988,635 3,302,822 3,648,999 4,027,640 4,444,301 4,902,631\nGrowth rate of electricity consumption (%) 9.3 9.3 9.3 9.3 24.5 10.5 10.5 10.5 10.4 10.3 10.3\nTechnical and non-technical distribution losses (% 45.5 45.5 45.5 45.5 45.5 18.0 18.0 18.0 18.0 18.0 18.0 18.0\nElectricity sent out from power station (kWh) 2,793,042 3,053,146 3,336,954 3,646,567 3,984,268 3,297,054 3,644,677 4,027,832 4,449,998 4,911,756 5,419,879 5,978,819\nA\np\np\nLoad factor 0.35 0.35 0.35 0.35 0.35 0.35 0.355 0.36 0.365 0.37 0.375 0.38 e\nn\nd\nPEAK LOAD (net) (kW) 911 996 1,088 1,189 1,300 1,075 1,172 1,277 1,392 1,515 1,650 1,796 ix\nGrowth rate of peak load (%) 9.3 9.3 9.3 9.3 (17.2) 9.0 9.0 9.0 8.9 8.9 8.9  1\n1\n, p\nkW = kilowatt a\ng\nkWH = kilowatt-hours e\n 2", "71\nAppendix 11, page 3\n1. The load forecasts for other towns are similar to that described for Kampot. The load\nforecasts for all eight towns covered under the Project are summarized in Table A11.2. For all\neight towns, the total energy sales in 2004 are forecast to be 133 percent higher than in 1999.\nThis increase is due to a combination of normal load growth over this five-year period, the\nimproved supply and an end to supply-side constraints when the Project is commissioned, an\nincrease in the total number of residential consumers serviced, some extensions of service\nareas, and the conversion of some nontechnical electricity losses to sales.

Least Cost Analysis\n2. The plans for development and expansion of the power supply in each town covered\nunder  this  Project,  except  for  Banlung,  include  complete  replacement  of  the  distribution\nsystems,  and  the  installation  and  commissioning  of  new  diesel  generating  capacity,  or\ntransmission interconnections to a larger grid system. At present all of these towns are isolated\nfrom any interconnected grid.\n3. Distribution systems are generally in very poor condition, having been almost entirely\ndestroyed during the war and replaced on an ad hoc basis since. Voltage levels of the medium\nvoltage (MV) distribution lines are often too low, such as 6 kilovolt kV) for modern utility designs,\nand these will all be upgraded and standardized at 22 kV for the new systems. Distribution\nlosses are very high; the total losses are typically about 35 to 50 percent, with an average of\n46 percent,  of  which  most  (probably  two  thirds)  are  technical  losses  and  the  balance  are\nnontechnical. The only practical way to reduce losses and to supply future growth is to replace\nthese old distribution systems completely, which will be done under the Project.\n4. For Banlung, however, the existing distribution system was constructed in 1993 and is\nstill in relatively good condition, and only expansion of this system is required. The high losses\nin Banlung are due mostly to nontechnical losses, and a change in local management is\nrequired to solve this problem.", "72\nAppendix 11, page 4\n5. For isolated power systems of this size, the least costly form of independent bulk power\nsupply is diesel power generation. Other forms of power generation, such as combined cycle or\nsteam thermal generation, are not economic or practical for the small generating units sizes\nrequired by these towns. Renewable energy generation from photovoltaic solar is much more\ncostly than diesel generation, except on a very small scale of only a few households to be\nserved. Two diesel unit sizes of 250 kilowatt (kW) and 500 kW have been chosen as a cost\neffective and standard size unit to be used for the towns in this Project that require their own\ngeneration.\n6. Small hydro sites of proven feasibility are not close enough to these towns to be feasible\nalternatives, except for Kampong Speu, which will be supplied by a transmission interconnection\nto the Kirirom hydro project nearby, which will be rehabilitated primarily to supply Phnom Penh.\n7. Transmission interconnections with the Phnom Penh power system, or with larger power\ngrid systems in Viet Nam and Thailand, were also considered wherever feasible. For Takeo,\nsuch a transmission interconnection would be too costly. For Svay Rieng, a 22 kV transmission\ninterconnection to Viet Nam is the least cost source of bulk power supply. For Sisophon, the\nrecommended least cost plan is to supply load growth with diesel generation initially for a few\nyears, and then to connect this town to a planned 115 kV transmission interconnection with\nThailand.\nC. Economic Benefits of Electricity Consumption\n8. For the economic analysis, the economic benefits of the Project are divided into two parts.\nThe first is the cost saving due to replacing the old and inefficient current power supply systems in\nthese towns. The second is the benefit of additional electricity sales arising from the Project.\n9. The cost saving due to replacing the current power systems is based on the tariffs\ncurrently charged in each town. These tariffs are established separately for each town and are\nquite high, ranging from $0.23 to $0.39 per kWh, with the exception of Banlung. The weighted\naverage tariff is $0.26 per kWh. Part of the reason for the high tariffs is the high distribution losses.\nFinancial accounts for these provincial power operations indicate that the tariffs are just adequate\nto cover their operating costs; depreciation is either neglected or very minimal; and interest\ncharges are always ignored. Consequently, the savings in operating costs by closing down the old\npower supply systems are equal to their total annual expenses, which approximately equal their\nannual revenues.\n10. The Project will (i) improve the quality of electricity supply for about 21,000 households\nwhich will already be connected in the eight towns in 2003 before project commissioning, and\n(ii) provide  new  service  connections  to  about  13,000  more  households  from  2004  to  2010.\nResidential consumers, who account for most electric energy sales, use electricity primarily for\nlighting,  and  to  a  lesser  extent  for  television,  radios,  fans,  and  other  electrical  appliances.\nHowever, electricity is not used for cooking in Cambodia, since it is much more costly than\nfirewood or kerosene. The additional or induced electricity consumption for residential consumers\nis valued on the basis of the average willingness to pay for electricity based on a demand versus\nprice curve that was derived from data for various towns in Cambodia. A large data set was\ncollected for towns in the Project and elsewhere in Cambodia with tariffs that vary over a wide\nrange, and average household consumption rates in these towns. This formed an excellent basis\nfor plotting a demand curve for residential electricity consumption in provincial towns, which is\nshown in Figure A11.1.", "73\nAppendix  11 , page  5\nFigure A11.1 -Domestic  Electricity  Demands in Cambodian  Towns\n6000\n5000\n4000\n~  3000\n-\n~\n'-=\nCG\n...\n2000\n1000\n0\n5 10 15  20  25 30 35 40\nTotal  Consumption  (kilowatt-hour/month)\n15.  The  average  willingness  to pay  under  this  demand  curve,  with  an  average  household\nconsumption  rate of 35 kWh  per month,  is about  KR1,640  per kWh,  or $0.43  per  kWh.  This  is\nreduced  by 10 percent  to reflect the fact that the survey sample  includes  only limited  connection\nrates  (typically  50- 75 percent)  at the  very  high tariff  end of the sample  for  small  private  power\ndistributors,  which  indicates  that  many  households  are not willing  to  pay  very  high  tariffs.  The\nvalues  are also adjusted  bya  standard  conversion  factor of 0.9 to convert  local financial  prices to\neconomic  border  prices.  The  resulting  average  economic  benefit  of  residential  consumption  is\nestimated  to be $0.35 per kWh.\n16.  Commercial  and small  industrial  consumers,  and public buildings,  that  account  for about\n20  to  30  percent  of total  energy  sales  in provincial  towns,  use  electricity  also  for  lighting,  for\nrefrigeration  and air-conditioning,  for mechanical  drives and other applications.  In the absence  of\npublic  electricity  supply,  they  would  have  to  generate  most  of  their  power  requirements\nthemselves  with small diesel  generator  sets. The alternative  economic  costs  of such  generation\nwith a mix of three typical  genset  sizes from 1 to 5 kW is about $0.35 per kWh in financial  prices,\nor about  $0.26  per  kWh  in economic  costs.  Current  tariff levels  for  such  customers  are  about\n$0.25 per kWh in financial  terms. The weighted average of current tariffs and alternative  economic\ncosts of self-generation  is estimated  to be $0.26 per kWh in economic  border prices.\nD.

The benchmark cost of crude oil is assumed to be $20 per\nbarrel, free-on-board Singapore, at year 2000 price levels. The economic internal rate of return\n(EIRR) for rehabilitation of power supply to Kampot is estimated to be 19.8 percent.\n1. The economic evaluation of each of the eight towns included in the Project is summarized\nin Table A11.4. The overall Project has an estimated EIRR of 17.8 percent for the base case.\nHowever, this economic evaluation of benefits is probably conservative for several reasons. In the\nevaluation of the cost saving of replacing the existing distribution systems and power plants, only\nthe savings in direct out-of-pocket operating expenses to the local power companies has been\nconsidered.  The improvement in quality and reliability of power supply is not considered, except\nfor the simple increase in kWh sold. There are other benefits to improved reliability however,\nincluding improved voltage levels, avoiding the social costs and inconveniences of power outages,\nand in the longer term, avoiding the need for many consumers to maintain rather costly standby\ncaptive power gensets for emergency use in case of an interruption of public supply. These costs\nand  benefits  are  difficult  to  evaluate  and  have  consequently  been  ignored,  but  they  are\nnevertheless real and probably substantial.\nTable A11.4  Summary of Project Economics\nPlanned Net Present\nProject Current Future Economic\nTown Investment Tariffs Tariffs EIRR FIRR Value\n($ million) ($/kWh) ($/kWh) (%) (%) ($ million)\nBanlung 0.230 0.072 0.090 \u2014 4.1\nKampot 3.000 0.270 0.216 19.8 4.1 1.0\nKompong Speu (tran.) 2.340 0.315 0.158 20.3 4.6 1.1\nPrey Veng 1.930 0.235 0.247 14.6 4.6 0.2\nSisophon 4.850 0.360 0.242 17.1 3.2 0.9\nStung Treng 2.060 0.390 0.295 12.2 4.3 0.0\nSvay Rieng (tran.) 3.440 0.234 0.173 22.0 5.4 1.3\nTakeo & Angtassom 3.870 0.278 0.226 14.6 3.9 0.3\nTotals 21.720 4.7\n Project Average 0.260 0.197 17.8 4.2\n\u2014  = not available, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, FIRR = financial internal rate of return;\nkWh = kilowatt-hour.\nNotes:\n(tran.) means future supplies will be via a transmission connection.\nProject investment is total capital cost required up to and including 2006, including physical and price\ncontingencies, taxes and duties, consulting services for the engineering implementation, and interest\nduring construction.\nCurrent tariffs are those in place for 2000.\nPlanned future tariffs are required tariffs in 2007, adjusted to year 2000 prices.\nThe FIRR is based on planned tariffs.\n2. Part A of the Project (infrastructure) is estimated to cost $21.7 million total for distribution\nand diesel generation investments up to 2006, including consumer connection costs, price\ncontingencies, duties and taxes. With an estimated 32,000 households connected in 2006, this\ncorresponds to an average cost of $680 per consumer in 2006. In later years, the average", "76\nAppendix 11, page 8\ninvestment in distribution per customer will decline, since the distribution system is designed for\nhigher future loads, but further investments in generation will still be required as loads grow.\n3. Sensitivity  analysis  was  conducted  for  the  scenarios  shown  in  Table  A11.5.  This\nindicates that the economic performance of the Project is robust for moderate increases in fuel\ncosts or in capital costs. Future crude oil prices are rather uncertain,1 nevertheless, the Project\ncan tolerate a large increase of oil prices up to $44 per barrel, at which point it switches to a\nmarginal (i.e., 12 percent) rate of return. The project economics are most sensitive to reductions\nin  estimated  unit  benefits  or  in  total  energy  sales.  The  Project  will  switch  to  becoming\nuneconomic if average benefit rates for new sales were reduced more than 30 percent, based\non a minimum 12 percent EIRR.\nTable A11.5:  Sensitivity Analysis\nEIRR FIRR\nSensitivity Scenario SIa SI\n(%)  (%)\nBase Case 17.79 \u2014 4.18 \u2014\nCrude Oil Costs Increased by 20% 16.87 .05 2.86 .07\nAll Capital Costs Increased by 10% 16.14 .16 3.20 .10\nAverage Benefits Reduced by 10% 15.92 .19 1.61 .26\nEnergy Sales Reduced by 10% 15.58 .22 2.80 .14\n\u2014 = not available, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, FIRR = financial internal rate of return,\nSI = sensitivity indicator.\n a   SI is the ratio of percentage change in the EIRR to the percentage change in the given parameter\nE.  Financial Evaluation of the Project\n4. The financial evaluation differs from the economic in that financial prices are used for all\nproject costs, which include duties and taxes on capital costs and fuel costs. Project benefits are\nbased on the financial revenues from electricity sales from the Project, starting in 2004. It is\nassumed that electricity tariffs will be adjusted,2 as shown in Table A11.4. The resulting financial\ninternal rate of return (FIRR) for each town is shown in the same table. The average FIRR for\nthe overall Project is estimated to be 4.2 percent. This FIRR is just enough to meet the weighted\naverage cost of capital to EDC for the Project financing, which is estimated to be 4.1 percent.3\nThe planned real tariffs at year 2000 prices after Project commissioning will be lower than the\ncurrent tariffs in most towns, as shown in Table A11.4. The average real tariff by 2007 will be\nabout 24 percent lower than now as shown in Appendix 9, Figure A9.\n5. The sensitivity analysis for the FIRR is somewhat academic, since in the event of an\nunexpected increase in project capital costs or fuel costs, or change in forecast sales, the\naverage tariff could be adjusted to achieve the agreed financial performance targets. In case of\ncrude oil prices higher than $20 per barrel, EDC\u2019s tariffs would have to increase about one\nquarter of one cent for each $1 per barrel increase in oil costs.\n                  \n1 Crude oil prices have fluctuated widely in the last two years. Current prices (Sept 2000) are about $32 per barrel,\nbut the World Bank\u2019s most recent commodity price forecast (May 2000) forecasts future crude oil prices of only $18\nper barrel at current prices in 2005, which is equivalent to about $16 per barrel at year 2000 price levels. Thus, $20\nper barrel assumed for this study is still considered a conservative estimate.\n2 The practice of EDC and Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy is to establish separate tariffs in each town,\ndepending on actual costs of service there. Consequently, tariffs in the project towns will be different from EDC's\naverage tariff in Phnom Penh.\n3 This cost is based on financing 75 percent of the total project costs for power infrastructure through the ADB loan\nat a relending interest rate of 3.5 percent, and 25 percent through equity investment with a required rate of return of\n6 percent.", "77\nAppendix 12\nEMPLOYMENT AND POVERTY STATISTICS OF THE PROJECT TOWNS\nTable A12.1:  Average Monthly Household Income By Sector\n     Of Employment In Project Areas\n           (KR\u2019000)\nKompong Prey Stung Svay\nSector Banlung Kampot Sisophon Takeo\nSpeu Veng Treng Rieng\nAgriculture 523 371 329 306 326 640 368 414\nFishing 0 338 0 0 0 491 0     0\nMining 0 970 0 0 690 0 0     0\nManufacture 0 420 612 536 234 970 895 321\nConstruction 350 430 602 672 247 580 0 350\nTrade/Repair 528 486 821 396 260 456 761 548\nCatering/Business 560 315 0 0 625 502 539 402\nTransport 351 325 568 351 288 347 357 460\nAdministration 578 756 580 424 440 563 670 408\nCommunity 620 421 443 508 729 0 781 410\nPrivate/NGO 0 0 0 0 0 0 850     0\nUnemployed 610 410 415 368 290 620 630 402\n  Weighted Ave.a 544 503 447 338 322 546 597 416\na Based on number of households in each sector.\nTable A12.2:  Poverty Share By Sector Of Employment\n(Percentage of Households)\nKompong Prey Stung Svay\nSector Banlung Kampot Sisophon Takeo\nSpeu Veng Treng Rieng\nAgriculture 8 9 19 29 21 2 11 25\nFishing 0 4 0 0 0 2 0 0\nMining 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\nManufacture 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1\nConstruction 1 0 1 0 4 2 0 0\nTrade/Repair 2 3 1 2 9 3 1 1\nCatering/Business 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\nTransport 1 1 1 1 6 4 3 1\nAdministration 9 3 2 2 2 6 3 4\nCommunity 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\nPrivate/NGO 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nUnemployed 2 4 4 3 4 1 5 0\n  Total Poverty 23 27 30 38 47 20 24 32"], "metadata": {"Author": "j3m", "CreationDate": "D:20010927082605Z", "Creator": "ADOBEPS4.DRV Version 4.10", "ModDate": "D:20131111190245+08'00'", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 3.01 for Windows", "Title": "Microsoft Word - R255-00RRP.DOC"}}
