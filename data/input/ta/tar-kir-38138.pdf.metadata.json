During the Country Strategy and Programming Mission in March 2004, the Ministry of \nFinance and Economic Development (MFED) emphasized the need for  preparatory project \ntechnical assistance (TA) to prepare a feasibility study for the development of an outer island \ngrowth center at Kiritimati (Christmas) Island. This was further confirmed at the development \npartners meeting in August 2004. The TA  was included in the 2004  country strategy and \nprogram update.1 A TA Fact-Finding Mission visited Kiribati from 19 to 21 October 2004 to reach \nan understanding with the Government on objectives and scope, implementation arrangements, \ncost  estimates,  and  outline  terms  of  reference  (TOR)  for  the  preparatory  project  TA.  A \nmemorandum of understanding was signed on 22 October 2004. The  project framework is \nshown in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The 90,000 people of Kiribati, who speak one national language and share one common \ncultural heritage, inhabit a country of 33 atolls and reef islands stretching 5,000 kilometers (km) \nacross the central-western Pacific. All the islands with a total land area of 810 square kilometers \n(km2) are surrounded by an exclusive  economic zone covering 3.5 million km2. By 2025, the \ntotal population of Kiribati could reach 140,000  \u2013to 145,000, with around 70,000  people in \nTarawa, the capital, (double the 2000 figure), 20,000  on Kiritimati Island, and  the remainder \nspread among the rest of the Gilbert, Line, and Phoenix island groups.  \n \n3.  The  2000  census  counted  9,200  people,  or  approximately  10%  of  the  population, \nworking in the cash economy in Kiribati, mostly in very small enterprises. Two out of every three \nemployed people worked in the public sector, and two out of every three of these were in the \ndensely populated South Tarawa.  The major challenge for the Government of Kiribati is to \nprovide jobs and a higher standard of living for its population, which is growing by approximately \n1.8% annually. \n \n4.  The country faces major development constraints, including (i) limited natural resources, \nespecially land and freshwater; (ii)  little potential for economies of scale given the small size of \nthe domestic market; (iii) widely scattered and sparsely populated islands, (iv)  limited cash \nemployment opportunities outside government and council employment in an outer islands \neconomy that exists basically at a subsistence level,; (v) difficult and expensive access by sea \nor  air  to  major  international  markets;  (vi) tourism  and  investment  facing  an  increasingly \ncompetitive international environment; (vii) limited understanding of or experience with business \nconcepts and practices among the population; (viii) lack of education and job skills among \nmembers of the labor force; (ix) social and cultural constraints to the development of land; and \n(x) low absorptive capacity for major investments. \n \n5.  To improve the rate and distribution of economic and social development and stem \nurban drift into Tarawa, the Government\u2019s strategic emphasis is  on promoting  outer island \ngrowth centers. This strategy is documented in the Government\u2019s national development strategy \nfor 2004\u20132007. Potential growth centers in the Gilbert and Phoenix  island groups will be \nidentified based on an island profiling and survey analysis supported by the United Nation \nDevelopment Programme. Kiritimati Island has already been identified as a potential growth \ncenter because of its location and existing economic activities. Appendix 2 presents the initial \npoverty and social analysis. \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 1 June 2004. \n ", "2  \n6.  Kiritimati Island is located in the Line Islands group 4,000 km east of the country\u2019s \ncapital. It is the world\u2019s largest atoll, covering an area of 642 km2, of which 325 km2 is land and \nthe remainder is lagoon and salt marshes. Kiritimati accounts for half of the country\u2019s total land \narea, and its promising potential has led to accelerating, and somewhat uncontrolled, migration \nto the island. Its proximity to Hawaii, and hence its access to markets; abundant, deepwater \ntuna  resources;  freshwater  resources  to  support  around  20,000  people;  existing  seaweed \nculture; exports of marine ornamental fish; and tourism potential are all likely to provide further \nopportunities to generate much-needed jobs, but at the same time call for an innovative and \nintegrated approach to development.  \n \n7.  Much  of  the  tourism  potential  depends  on  retaining  the  unique  and  attractive \nenvironment on Kiritimati Island, which, among other attractions, is host to the largest breeding \ncolony of sooty terns in the world and holds world record sizes of bonefish in its large lagoon. \nThe Asian Development Bank  (ADB) will incorporate sound and appropriate environmental \nobjectives into the Project design and also attempt to raise grant funding from the Global \nEnvironment Facility for integrated ecosystem management.  \n \n8.  Kiritimati has been almost continuously occupied since 1882, when the first attempt was \nmade to plant coconuts for commercial production of copra. It was a major military base in the \n1950s and 1960s  and was used  for nuclear weapons testing by both the British and the \nAmericans. The testing was atmospheric and took place offshore, and apparently no trace of \nradioactive contamination remains. More recently, Kiritimati has been chosen as a base for the \nJapanese space exploration agency. These activities account for most of the road and runway \ninfrastructure in place today. A new weekly commercial air service  from the Fiji Islands via \nKiritimati Island to Hawaii and back again will commence in November or December 2004. \n \n9.  Kiritimati has few  commercial enterprises. Some phosphate mining started in the late \n1880s and brine shrimp production in the salt flats had a short period of success in the 1970s \nbefore prices slumped, but otherwise seaweed  and copra  production have been the main \nsources of income since Kiribati gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1979, even \nthough copra production peaked around 1920. Exports of coral reef aquarium fish commenced \nonly in recent years, but  the success of this venture  also calls for greater awareness  of its \nimpact on reef ecosystems.  \n \n10.  Kiritimati  offers  a  unique  opportunity  to  advance  the  Government\u2019s  development \nobjectives through an integrated economic, social, and environmental strategy. Its  relatively \nlarge size, Government ownership of all land,2 and relative proximity to Hawaii mean that its \ndevelopment  potential  is  relatively  unconstrained.  However,  at  the  same  time  Kiritimati  is \nvulnerable to (i) constant and poorly regulated immigration from the rest of the country, (ii) poor \ndevolution of responsibilities to the local government, (iii) a fragile ecology, and (iv) limited fresh \nwater.  \n \n11.  Supporting infrastructure for environmental protection and  private sector-led economic \nactivity  is  a  high  priority  for  making  development  sustainable  and  preserving  the  island\u2019s \nuniqueness. Ongoing TA3 from ADB is intended to improve land management systems to meet \nthe projected increasing demand for land for residential and business purposes. This TA needs \n                                                 \n2  Land on Kiritimati can only be leased, a unique situation in the Pacific, where most land is customary, can normally \nnot be used as collateral, and is difficult to designate for development. \n3  ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Kiribati for Supporting Land Use Management on Kiritimati \n(Christmas) Island. Manila.   ", "  3\nto be complemented by assistance to (i) implement zoning for development and protect existing \nfreshwater lenses; (ii) ensure that existing and future villages and urban areas are supported by \nwater, power, and roads; and, above all, (iii) plan for proper sanitation infrastructure.  \n \n12.  ADB experience with outer island development in Kiribati relates to a TA4 that designed \na concept to support social infrastructure and improved livelihood through the establishment of a \ntrust fund. Islands and island communities would also contribute towards this trust fund and the \nrespective island councils would decide what activities to implement. However, the program did \nnot materialize because of a change of Government in 2002. The focus of the new Government \nis now on private sector development and economic growth, with corresponding job creation. \nSubsequently, this TA has been designed accordingly with emphasis on a coordinated urban \ndevelopment with supporting infrastructure for private sector development based on economic \nconsiderations.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n13.  The purpose of the TA is to prepare the Outer Island Growth Centers Project. The TA \nwill identify the necessary infrastructure and supporting measures required for private sector \ngrowth, employment generation, and sustainable use of natural resources on Kiritimati Island. \n \n14.   The output of the TA will be a feasibility study of an investment proposal for a long-term, \nstrategic development plan for Kiritimati Island that considers land use planning and zoning for \nresidential,  business,  and  recreational/protected  areas;  tourism  and  other  economic \ndevelopment; increased entrepreneurship by young people; telecommunications; transportation; \nexpanded  water  and  sewer  systems  and  protection  of  freshwater  lenses;  solid  waste \nmanagement; and supporting infrastructure.  \n \n15.   The  scope  of  work  will  encompass,  (i)  substantiating  the  economic  feasibility  of \ninvestment based on diagnostic work on sources of growth and prospects, including industries \nand their local and regional markets and labor markets and employment; (ii) proposing land use \nmanagement options and associated administrative and legislative systems; (iii)  identifying \nrequired infrastructure, services, and support facilities to support immediate and medium-term \neconomic development; (iv)  preparing a long-term strategic development plan; (v)  identifying \ninstitutional arrangements for strategic development; (vi) identifying social issues relating to the \nproposed development plan; and (vii) submitting a full environmental impact assessment with \nclear  recommendations  for  mitigating  measures  to safeguard  the  island\u2019s  uniqueness  and \nbiodiversity. Recommendations from the World Bank\u2019s Climate Adaptation Program will be \ntaken into account. Efforts will also be made to explore possibilities for additional funding from \nthe Global Environment Facility for specific project components. \n \n16.   The TA will also help the Ministry of Internal and Social Affairs (MISA) and the United \nNations Development Programme to identify key survey data to be collected in selected growth \ncenters in the Gilbert and Phoenix island groups and to analyze these data through periodic \nconsultancy input from the TA team. ADB\u2019s consultancy input will be approximately 0.5 person-\nmonth.  ADB  has  no other  plans  for  involvement  in  any  identified  growth  centers  outside \nKiritimati Island.   \n                                                 \n4 ADB. 2000.

Methodology and Key Activities \n17.  The TA will be implemented using a phased approach. Phase I will begin by focusing on \ndiagnostic work, including analyzing constraints to and opportunities for Kiritimati becoming an \neconomic  growth  center,  paying  specific  attention  to  economic  links  with  major  regional \neconomic partners. If potential for economic growth can be substantiated, the TA consultants \nwill identify the institutional arrangements and policy reforms needed to bring such potential to \nfruition, and will present the resulting findings and conclusions for discussion at a workshop with \npertinent Government agencies. Upon agreement on  the findings, the TA  consultants will (i) \nconduct  a  feasibility  analysis  for  a  comprehensive  development  plan  for  Kiritimati  Island \nencompassing analysis of  its biophysical and social  features and natural resource potential \nand economic  valuation of the  resources  and  their  potential  for  development;  (ii)  identify \nrequired  infrastructure  and  services;  (iii)  comment  in  details  on  the  TOR  for  work  to  be \nundertaken during phase II; and (iv) help MISA prepare survey questionnaires and analyze the \ndata collected.  \n \n18.  Phase II will produce a comprehensive and detailed feasibility study for an investment \nproposal for Kiritimati Island. The areas to be covered during phase II include (i) an investment \nplan for short-, medium-, and long-term development; (ii) the formulation of legal and regulatory \npriorities for investment; (iii) the detailed design of proposed infrastructure for ADB financing \nand  preliminary  and  conceptual  designs  of  infrastructure  for  non-ADB  investment;  (iv)  an \nassessment of  capacity building and monitoring needs; (v)  the preparation of proposals for \nsetting up maintenance funds and cost-recovery mechanisms; (vi) a training needs assessment, \n(viii) the calculation of economic costs and benefits for the overall development plan; (ix) the \ndetailed calculation of economic and financial rates of return as a basis for selecting the most \nurgent infrastructure subprojects for ADB financing; and (x) a social analysis as required and a \nfull environmental impact assessment if required. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n19.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $945,000  equivalent,  of  which  $709,000 \nequivalent is the foreign exchange cost and $236,000 equivalent is the local currency cost. ADB \nwill provide financing in an amount of $800,000, covering the entire foreign currency cost and \n$91,000 of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB's  TA \nfunding program. The Government will provide financing of $145,000 in local currency costs to \ncover office accommodation, counterpart staff in the form of a main liaison person and others as \nrequired  and  their  transport,  and  office  space.  The  Government  has been informed that \napproval  of  the  TA  does  not  commit  ADB  to  finance  any  ensuing  project.  Detailed  cost \nestimates are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.   MFED  will  be  the  executing  agency, and the Ministry of Line and Phoenix Islands \nDevelopment    and  MISA  will  be  the  implementing  agencies  and  will  provide  dedicated \ncounterparts to the TA to ensure that appropriate inputs and relevant data from other relevant \nline ministries and other agencies\u2014e.g., the Ministry of Communication, Transport, and Tourism \nDevelopment;  the  Ministry  of  Environment,  Land,  and  Agriculture;  the  Land  Management \nDivision, Kiritimati; the Ministry of Commerce, Industry, and Cooperatives; the Ministry of Works; \nand the Kiritimati Local Land Planning Board\u2014are freely  available  on  a timely basis. The \nimplementing agencies will provide the necessary office space with access to e-mail, telephone, \nand facsimile services. ", "  5\n21.   A steering committee, chaired by a representative from the Ministry of Line and Phoenix \nIslands Development and including representatives from at least the main ministries involved \n(para. 20), will be established to oversee all milestone events of the TA, namely, the inception, \nmidterm review, and draft final reports; ensure that all concerned ministries and agencies are \nkept abreast of progress; and that individual sector concerns are incorporated appropriately.  \n \n22.  Phase I will take 3 months. In phase II, a feasibility study for an investment proposal will \nbe prepared with objectives and scope, outputs, methodology, key activities, and an updated \nproject framework. The draft feasibility analysis from Phase I together with the comments to the \nTOR for Phase II  will be submitted to  MFED and ADB at least 10 days before a tripartite \nmeeting in Kiribati, during which the detailed TOR for Phase II will be finalized and final details \nfor a feasibility study for an investment proposal for partial ADB financing will be agreed upon in \na memorandum of understanding between the Government and ADB.  \n \n23.  Subject to satisfactory performance of the consultants in phase I, the same firm may be \noffered a contract, through direct selection, to implement and complete phase II. Phase II is \nexpected to  commence about 4 weeks after the  memorandum of understanding  has been \nsigned.  \n \n24.  For phase ,I the TA will finance  up to 11 person-months of international  consulting \nservices with the following expertise: (i) development planner/team leader, (ii) economist, (iii) \ninfrastructure engineer, (iv) social specialist, and (v) environmental specialist. In phase II the TA \nis anticipated to finance a total of up to 16 person-months of international consulting services \nwith the same expertise. In phase I, 1.5 person-months will be unallocated, and in phase II, 3.0 \nperson-months should  be  unallocated  to  allow  flexibility  to  engage  consultants  with  other \nexpertise as may be required. Outline TOR for phase I and in part for phase II are shown in \nAppendix 4.  \n \n25.  The consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants by the Asian Development Bank and its Borrowers. Phase I will commence on 1 \nMarch 2005 and be completed by the end of May 2005. Phase II will commence on 1 July 2005 \nand  be  completed  by  the  end  of  November  2005.  ADB\u2019s  simplified  technical  proposal \nprocedures will be followed,  and  given  the somewhat complex nature of the TA and the \ndesirability of soliciting an innovative approach, the Quality Based Selection procedures will be \napplied. \n \n26.  The consultants will carry out the TA in consultation with relevant stakeholders, including \npublic sector agencies, private commercial interests, industry groups, affected communities, and \ncivil society representatives. Workshops will be convened during the course of the TA to present \nthe major key findings and  to solicit feedback on problems, constraints, and potential. The \nconsultations are intended to improve the quality of the analyses, to disseminate results, and to \ndevelop consensus on the recommendations. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n27.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Kiribati for preparing the Outer Islands Growth Centers Project, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n ", " \n6\n \nPRELIMINARY PROJECT FRAMEWORK \n  A\np\np\ne\nn\nAssumptions  d\nix\nDesign Summary  Performance Indicators and Targets  Monitoring Mechanisms  and Risks   1\n \n \nGoal (for ensuing loan)       \nEnhancing and ensuring the  Demonstrable contribution to accelerated  National economic statistics \nequitable distribution of  and inclusive economic growth in target  National accounts \ndevelopment benefits  islands   \n     \nReduced disparities in household  Household and Income \nincomes across the population  Expenditures Survey \n   \nDemonstrable contribution to Kiribati\u2019s  Millennium Development \ntargets for Millennium Development Goals  Goal related monitoring and \nin education, health, and sanitation    reporting \n \nPurpose (for ensuing loan)       \nTo increase employment  Creation of XX% more jobs in the private  Ministry of Commerce,  Land leases for business and \nopportunities on Kiritimati  sector than in the Government by year  Industry, and Cooperatives  residential use are issued \nisland    20XX  annual report  according to agreed upon \n      procedures \n   \nStrategic development plan is \nfollowed \n \nOutputs (for the PPTA)       \nA feasibility study for a long- Investment proposal with costing of  Inception report  Phase I of the PPTA confirms \nterm strategic development  strategic infrastructure development and    ADB-financed investment \nplan for Kiritimati island  recommendations for supportive  Mid-term review report  potential \n  regulatory frameworks for private sector     \n  involvement finalized by November 2005  Draft final and final reports   \n   \nActivities (for the PPTA)       \nDiagnostic work on sources      Consultants fielded on time \nof growth and prospects     \n   \nProposing land use \nmanagement options \nContinued on next page ", " \nAssumptions \nDesign Summary  Performance Indicators and Targets  Monitoring Mechanisms  and Risks \n \nIdentification of required \ninfrastructure to support \neconomic development \n \nIdentification of institutional \narrangements for strategic \ndevelopment \n \nUndertake required social \nand environmental studies \nInputs (for the PPTA)       \nInternational Consulting  $310,000 in Phase I \nServices:  $490,000 in Phase II \n   \nDevelopment Planner/Team  Phase I: 3.0 person-months  \nLeader  Phase II: 4.0 person-months  \n   \nEconomist  Phase 1: 2.0 person-months  \n  Phase II: 3.0 person-months \n   \nInfrastructure Engineer  Phase I: 1.5 person-months  \n  Phase II: 3.5 person-months  \n     \nSocial Specialist  Phase I: 1.5 person-months  \n  Phase II: 3.0 person-months  \n   \nEnvironmental Specialist  Phase I: 1.5 person-months \n  Phase II: 2.5 person-months \nUnallocated  Phase I:  1.5 person-months \n  Phase II: 3.0 person-months \n \n \nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nix\n 1\n \n7\n ", "8  Appendix 2 \nINITIAL POVERTY AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS  \n \nA.
