The  widespread  destruction  included\nlooting, burning, and damage to town and village water supplies\nand sanitation facilities throughout the country.  Typically in towns\nwith public water supply  systems,  vehicles, pumps,  and motors\nwere removed; water treatment plants damaged; offices, stores and\nother  buildings  burned;  pipelines,  tools  and  spare  parts  stolen;\nstorage tanks ruptured; latrines and septic tanks damaged; and\nwater sources impaired. And with the burning of houses, water\nconnections, including meters, were completely destroyed. None of\nthe  former  water  supply  or  sanitation  institutions  now  exist.\nTherefore it is essential to support physical repair and rehabilitation,\nand  reestablish  new  institutions  and  systems  for  managing,\noperating,  maintaining,  and  developing  urban  and  rural  water\nsupplies in East Timor that are both appropriate and sustainable.\nThe total needs for rehabilitation of the water supply and sanitation\n(WS&S) sector were estimated at US$39.9 million for the FY 2001-\n2003, with approximately US$12 million to 15 million expected from\nTrust Fund for East Timor (TFET) funds and the remaining balance\nfrom  other  sources.  However,  with  current  TFET  funds  being\nallocated across various sectors, only US$4.5 million can be made\navailable  for  FY  2001.  The  following  Project  description\ncorresponds  to  the  TFET  funds  available  (US$4.5  million).\nDiscussions with the United Nations Transitional Administration in\nEast Timor (UNTAET) and the TFET trustee indicate that more\nfunds may become available in FY 2002, in which case a follow-up\nproject will be developed.\nProject Description The Project  will  (i)  develop  a WS&S  sector  management  and\ninvestment  program  that  includes  establishment  of  a  project\nmanagement unit (PMU) under UNTAET\u2019s Water and Sanitation\nAuthority  (WSA),  and  preparation  of  a  detailed,  budgeted,\nprogram implementation document for coordinated improvement\nof East Timor\u2019s WS&S sector; (ii) implement a capacity building\nand  institutional  development  program  that  will  identify  and\nimplement  priority  activities  to  support  physical  reconstruction\nalready under way or being planned, and to complement capacity-\nbuilding and institutional development activities by other donors;\nand (iii) commence a WS&S implementation program, comprising\n(a) the WSA WS&S quick response facility,  (b) complementary\nworks for Dili water supply repair and rehabilitation already under\nway by other donors, and (c) complementary works for the district\nwater supply repair and rehabilitation already under way by other\ndonors.", "iii\nThe Project is classified as environmental category B. An initial\nenvironmental examination was undertaken, and its summary is a\ncore appendix.\nBeneficiaries Urban and rural populations throughout East Timor will benefit.\nThe immediate benefits of the Project include (i) providing the\nmeans for improved WS&S, and (ii) upgrading the quality of life for\npeople in both urban and rural areas whose attempts to improve\ntheir status and health are continually impeded by the need to\ndivert time, energy, and financial resources to acquire their daily\nwater needs. The Project will generate employment through local\nlabor,  thus  helping  to  create  a  stable  social  and  economic\nenvironment.  It  is  expected  that  the  Project  will  directly  or\nindirectly benefit a large part of the country's 800,000 population.\nThe Project is designed to distribute its benefits in an equitable\nmanner  across  East  Timorese  urban  and  rural  communtities,\ncontributing  to  sustainable  development  and  operation  in  the\nWS&S sector, and reducing poverty.\nExecuting Agency UNTAET  will  be  the  recipient  of  the  grant  from  the  TFET.\nUNTAET will establish within WSA a PMU that reports  to  the\nUNTAET  infrastructure  cabinet  member  through  the  head  of\nPublic  Utilities  via  the  head  of  WSA.  The  PMU  will  program,\nadminister, and coordinate daily project activities.  UNTAET will\nalso  establish  a  project  steering  committee  involving  broad\nstakeholder representation.\nCost Estimates and The  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  US$4.50  million\nFinancing Plan equivalent.

THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following report on a project grant to the United Nations\nTransitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) for the benefit of East Timor from the Trust\nFund for East Timor (TFET) for the Water Supply and Sanitation Rehabilitation Project.1 The\nProject framework is in Appendix 1.\nII. INTRODUCTION\n2. UNTAET, in consultation with the National Consultative Council of East Timor (NCC) and\nmembers of East Timor's civil society, have asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB), through\nthe TFET,  to provide assistance to rehabilitate and restore damaged and inadequate water\nsupply and sanitation infrastructure throughout East Timor, and concurrently to reestablish the\nhuman and institutional capacity needed to manage, operate, and maintain the facilities. An ADB\nMission2  was to prepare an initial emergency rehabilitation project with authorized UNTAET\nrepresentatives. The agreements reached were confirmed in a memorandum of understanding.\nFunding for the Project will be drawn from the TFET, which is established under the trusteeship of\nthe International Development Association (IDA) of the World Bank Group. The TFET does not\ninclude ADB's own resources. The Project has been prepared in accordance with the Joint\nManagement Arrangements for the Trust Fund for East Timor.3\nIII. BACKGROUND\nA. Description of Damage\n3. On 30 August 1999, the people of East Timor voted overwhelmingly for independence.\nThe following month, East Timor experienced extensive destruction during which three quarters of\nthe population fled their homes, and most of the country\u2019s infrastructure and private homes were\ndestroyed. In the western half of the territory and the highland areas, most property of value\nincluding residential and public buildings, utilities, telecommunications facilities, and inventories of\nessential food and agriculture stocks were removed, burned, or destroyed. The eastern half\nexperienced similar attacks with an estimated 75 percent of residential buildings destroyed.\n4. The widespread destruction included looting, burning, and damage to town and village\nwater supply and sanitation (WS&S) facilities throughout the country.  Typically in towns with\npublic water supply systems, vehicles, pumps, and motors were removed; water treatment plants\ndamaged; offices, stores and other buildings burned; pipelines, tools and spare parts stolen;\nstorage tanks ruptured; latrines and septic tanks damaged; and water sources impaired.  And in\nthe burning of houses, water connections, including meters, were completely destroyed.\n5. Elsewhere in peri-urban and rural villages throughout the countryside, damage to water\nsupplies was not extensive, but there are reports of wells being poisoned, handpumps stolen,\npipes removed, and spring intakes damaged.  Apart from the physical damage to infrastructure,\nmost water WS&S records and documentation  were destroyed,  so there  is now  only  scant\n                                                       \n1  The Project first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in May 2000.\n2\n The Mission comprised Mr. Walter Poick, Financial Analyst (Mission Leader) and Mr. Ian Binch, ADB Staff\nConsultant.\n3  R74-00: Joint Management Arrangements for the Trust Fund for East Timor, 23 March 2000.", "2\ninformation available about past operations, the status of institutions, or the systems themselves.\nAdditionally, most former water supply managers have left East Timor.\n6. None of the former water supply or sanitation institutions now exist.  The challenge for\nUNTAET will be to reinstate institutions and systems to manage, operate, maintain, and  develop\nurban and rural water supplies in East Timor that are both appropriate and sustainable; and that\nunlike before, do not burden future administrations with the need for recurrent cost subsidies from\nwhat, inevitably, will be very tight central budgets.\nB. Response to the Crisis\n1. Governance\n7. UNTAET was established on 25 October 1999 for an initial period until 31 January 2001\npursuant to Resolution 1272 (1999) of the Security Council of the United Nations (UN), with\npowers to ensure stability and establish a transitional government and judiciary, laws, and\npolicies. It is expected that the UNTAET transitional government will continue to administer East\nTimor at least through to general elections. Governmental responsibility  is  exercised  by  a\ntransitional administrator, who since July 2000 has been assisted by a cabinet consisting of\neight portfolios, four of which are held by East Timorese and four by international UNTAET staff.\nThe cabinet is chaired by the transitional administrator, who is also the Special Representative\nof the Secretary-General (SRSG). The cabinet portfolios are as follows:\n(i)  Police and Emergency Services,\n(ii)  Justice,\n(iii)  Political Affairs,\n(iv)  Finance,\n(v)  Internal Administration,\n(vi)  Infrastructure,\n(vii)  Economic Affairs, and\n(viii)  Social Affairs.\n8. UNTAET's financial year runs from 1 July to 30 June, with its recurrent budget drawn\nfrom UNTAET's own Trust Fund using UN disbursement guidelines.\n9. East Timor is divided into 13 districts (including the enclave of Oecusso-Ambeno), 63\nsubdistricts, and 442 villages. An UNTAET district administrator, with supporting international\nand local staff representing the range of sectoral activities, oversees each district. There are\nreportedly plans by local leaders to subdivide the territory into three regions after transition to\nself-government. A key objective during the transition is to establish a small civil service with a\nlean administrative structure that can be sustained in the long term.\n10. The capital development budget, to be drawn from the TFET, was assessed by a World\nBank-coordinated,  multiagency,  joint  assessment  mission  in  October-November  1999.  The\nmission identified needs for technical assistance and investment projects in consultation with\nthe National Council for Timorese Resistance and UNTAET. The mission reviewed WS&S\nsector  restoration  requirements  and  estimated  the  cost  of  a  three-year  program  of\nreconstruction and recovery for water systems and utilities to be about US$25 million, and for\ndrainage and sanitation systems about US$8 million.", "3\n11. The NCC was established under UNTAET Regulation No. 1999/2 on 2 December 1999.\nIt was designed as a mechanism through which representatives of the East Timorese people\ncould actively participate in the decision-making processes during UNTAET's administration,\nand through which the views, concerns, traditions, and interests of the East Timorese people\ncould be represented. The aim of the NCC was to provide advice on all matters related to the\nexercise  of  the  transitional  administrator's  executive  and  legislative  functions,  while  not\nprejudicing the administrator's final authority. The NCC has now been replaced by a National\nCouncil  (NC).  The  NC  has  33  members  drawn  from  the  following  areas:  13  district\nrepresentatives, 7 representatives from CNRT, 3 drawn from  other  political  parties,  and  1\nrepresentative each from the youth/students, women's groups, Timorese NGO forum, Catholic\nchurch, Protestant church, the Muslim community, professional associations, farmers, labor,\nand business.\n2. Impact of Crisis on Poverty\n12. In 1996, when East Timor was part of Indonesia, its per capita income was US$431. The\nIndonesian national average was US$1,153. Agriculture continues to dominate the economy,\nwith some 76 percent of the national labor force involved in the sector. Subsistence agriculture,\nmainly rice and corn crops, with supplementary coffee and beef production, dominates the\nmodes of production. As a result of the 1997 Asian financial and economic downturn, gross\ndomestic product (GDP) in Indonesia, including East Timor, declined as devaluation of the\nIndonesian rupiah and high interest rates dampened economic activity. Indonesia was the\ncountry hit hardest by the Asian downturn. The decline in East Timor's GDP was, however,\nmore pronounced due to its dependence on  Indonesian  central government  grants,  which\nfinanced up to 85 percent of current and capital expenditure. Between 1997 and the 1999\npopular consultation, East Timorese GDP contracted by some 25 percent. In 1998, per capita\nincome was estimated to have fallen to US$300, among the lowest in the Asian and Pacific\nRegion.\n13. As a result of the post-August 1999 violence, both public and private sectors suffered\nalmost total collapse. The planting season for 2000 was seriously disrupted due to destruction\nof field crops, subsequent labor shortages, and lack of access to seeds and tools. All of these\nmade the social and economic development challenge a daunting one that could be met only\nwith effective and substantial international assistance.\n14. In 1996, 30 percent of East Timorese households were living in poverty\u2014double the\nnational average in Indonesia. The number of households living below the poverty line rose to\nan estimated 50 to 60 percent as a result of the 1997 Asian downturn. The human dislocation\nand  destruction  that  occurred  consequent  to  East  Timor's  separation  from  Indonesia  has\nresulted in severe disruption to the essentially subsistence economy. Although an estimated\n120,000 people have now returned to their villages, many face severe food shortage as their\ncrops, seeds, and other means of livelihood were destroyed. The international community,\nespecially the World Food Program, has been distributing food and seeds. Even the small East\nTimorese middle and upper groups were not spared from poverty as banks and their records\nwere burned. Indonesian banks exclusively serviced banking in East Timor; only three banks\nhave plans to reopen and possibly settle depositors' claims. Up to 80 percent of East Timorese\nmay now be living below the poverty line. However, food stability will improve if agriculture\nrecovers as expected this year. The World Food Program estimates that by the end of 2000, a\nconsiderable portion of the population will no longer be at risk, and the program will then be able\nto scale down its intervention.", "4\nC. Water Supply and Sanitation Sector\n15. A detailed sector profile is provided in Appendix 2.\n1. Preconsultation Water Supply and Sanitation Management\n16. Under  Indonesian  administration,  public  water  supplies  were  controlled  by  the\nDirectorate General of Human Settlements (DG Cipta Karya) of the Ministry of Public Works\nbased in Jakarta, working through its provincial and district offices.  At the local level, public\npiped water supply systems were classified according to their size and financial viability.  The\nhighest system was a local government water enterprise (PDAM).  A system was classified as a\nPDAM if it was able to internally generate sufficient revenue to be sustainable.  The only PDAM\nin East Timor was in Dili, and while it had recently graduated to PDAM status, it is understood to\nhave still needed subsidization from the central government.  At the intermediate level, each\ndistrict had a district water board (BPAM) responsible for all public piped water supplies in its\ndistrict. The principle was that, over a defined time, the larger district town systems were\nsupposed to develop their management, administrative, and operation and maintenance skills to\nthe point where the BPAM could graduate to a PDAM.  In the meantime, all BPAM systems had\nto be subsidized from the central budget.  The base level of public water supplies were those in\nthe main subdistrict towns. The district BPAM office carried out operation and maintenance of\nthe subdistrict town systems, which also required substantial subsidies.  Thus, prior to the crisis,\nno public water supplies in East Timor were financially viable, all were subsidized from the\ncentral budget.  And even with such support, water quality, coverage, and service reliability was\nuniversally poor.\n17. Rural water supplies and all sanitation during the Indonesian administration were the\nresponsibility of the Department of Health (Depkes).  At the subdistrict level, Depkes operated a\nsystem of \u201csanitarians\u201d working out of the local puskesmas, or community health center.  Their\nrole included helping with community environmental health training and helping villagers with\ndevelopment  of  their  WS&S  facilities.    Despite  their  presence,  an  Australian  Agency  for\nInternational Development (AusAID) design team noted in September 19994 that there was a\ngenerally low level of service provision in both WS&S throughout the rural areas.  The team\nconcluded that many rural communities in East Timor do not have adequate access to clean\nwater and that this is a significant factor contributing to the poor health and hygiene conditions\nin the villages.\n2. Water Supply Status\n18. It has been estimated that prior to the postconsultation disruption, less than half of East\nTimor's total population had access to safe water and sanitation.  A recent census,  SUSENAS\n1998,5 indicated the access to various forms of water supply was approximately as shown in\nTable 1:\n                                                       \n4  Coffey MPW Pty Ltd., in association with Egis Consulting Australia, September 1999, East Timor Environmental\nSanitation and Water Supply Project \u2013 Revised Project Design Document.

Prior to the crisis, the public water supply network was fairly extensive, covering the 13\ndistrict towns and 49 of the 63 subdistrict towns, a total of 62 systems.  However, the quality of\nsystem construction was generally poor, and coverage was variable but low, commonly ranging\nfrom about 25 to 40 percent in the central parts of towns. Private shallow wells were used\nextensively in Dili and other towns, especially those near the sea or on river plains.  All 440 rural\nvillages had water supplies of varying type, but most were of very low standard. During the\nviolence, damage to all public piped water systems was extensive but rural water supplies were\nnot as badly affected. When hostilities abated, many nongovernment organizations (NGOs)\nmoved into East Timor to deliver humanitarian assistance; a number specialized in water and\nenvironmental  health.  Over  the  past  few  months,  these  NGOs  have  formed  the  core  of\nassistance  to  the  WS&S  sector,  providing  equipment,  materials,  and  personnel  to  make\nemergency repairs, mainly to piped town water supplies but also for some of the 440 rural\nvillages scattered throughout East Timor. This work is being done in collaboration with the\ndistrict administrators, who have hired employees of former water supply companies to help with\nrepairs, operation, and maintenance. By May 2000, water supplies in most of the 13 district\ntowns, including Dili, had been reestablished, albeit in rudimentary form. Local and international\nNGOs have also been engaged in rehabilitating rural water supplies; providing hand pumps;\ncleaning contaminated wells; and repairing pipes, tanks, and the like. Overall, public water\nsupplies in towns across East Timor are now still in a very rudimentary and quite precarious\ncondition, although for the most part some water is available. Historically rural communities\nhave not normally had acceptable water supplies, so even though they did not suffer too much\nin the crisis, most require rehabilitation and development.\n20. A piped and treated water supply system served approximately 8,200 households in Dili.\nThis was operated by the previous Indonesian PDAM (Dili Water Authority). The level of service\nwas less than satisfactory, with water often not available and of poor quality. Customers were\ncharged Rp150 per cubic meter for household supplies; larger consumers were charged at\nhigher rates. Some 40-50 percent of Dili\u2019s population is estimated to have relied on poor quality\nwater from shallow wells in their yards. Since the disruption, the Water and Sanitation Authority\n(WSA), assisted by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the Government\nof Australia, has employed staff and carried out system repairs.  Despite this, many areas of Dili\nstill experience daily water shortages, mainly through leakage from the poorly maintained pipe\nsystem.  Most existing district reticulation systems are in need of repair and augmentation to\nmeet the needs of urban communities.  Water losses because of leakage or illegal tapping is\nvery high.", "6\n21. In other district and subdistrict towns which were formerly operated by the previous\nBPAMs, average service coverage was in the low 20 to 30 percent range and water quality was\ngenerally unsatisfactory.  None of the more than 60 piped systems provided 24-hour service.\nCustomers in the smaller centers were charged at differing rates, generally much lower than\nDili.\n3. Sanitation Status\n22. Evidence suggests that at preconsultation, the excreta disposal situation in East Timor\nwas already causing significant health problems. 1998 SUSENAS Table 2 illustrates the various\nexcreta disposal methods used:\nTable 2: Excreta Disposal Methods\nApprox. % of Total Approx. % of\nDisposal Method East Timor Population Dili Population\nUsing Method Using Method\nPrivate toilet with septic tank 10 34\nPrivate toilet without septic tank 15 23\nShared toilet 6 6\nPublic toilet 11 1\nDirect on cesspool 23 16\nBushes, forest, and yard 29 7\nPond \u2013 \u2013\nRiver and stream 4 \u2013\nOther 12 1\nSource:  Survai Sosial Economi Nasional, 1998.\n23. Postconsultation  disturbance  resulted  in  destruction  of  many  buildings  that  housed\ntoilets with or without septic tanks.  It did not greatly affect the traditional (i.e., nontoilet) facilities.\nThe overall effect of the destruction of both sanitation facilities and water supplies is that a far\ngreater number of persons are now using traditional methods. So far, little effort has been made\nto restore or improve environmental sanitation in either towns or villages.\n4. Short-Term Focus\n24. Much of the funding for the emergency  phase  came from  bilateral  and  multilateral\nsources. UNTAET has recently established the Water and Sanitation Authority (WSA) for East\nTimor. Staff are now being recruited, and operational funding obtained from the UNTAET Trust\nFund and bilateral and multilateral donors. As WSA\u2019s capacity increases, the NGOs are keen to\nhand over responsibility for public WS&S, and to focus on rural WS&S, which is their main\ntarget area. None of the former water supply or sanitation institutions now exist.  The challenge\nfor UNTAET is twofold. First it will have to repair and rehabilitate the many damaged urban and\nrural WS&S facilities to an appropriate level of operation. Its second task will be to reestablish\ninstitutions and systems for managing, operating, maintaining, and  developing urban and rural\nwater supplies in East Timor that are both appropriate and sustainable. These, unlike before,\nmust not burden future administrations with the need for subsidies from what, inevitably, will be\nvery tight central budgets.", "7\n5. Medium- to Long-Term Sector Development\n25. An ADB  mission  was  fielded  in  April  2000  to  develop  a  draft  sector  development\nframework for East Timor's water sector. This framework aims at providing the people of East\nTimor with adequate and affordable WS&S services using appropriate technology and good\nsystem management.  It proposed that this would be done by:\n(i)  building local capacity and capability to effectively manage the WS&S sector;\n(ii)  rehabilitating and developing WS&S facilities in urban and rural communities;\nand\n(iii)  promoting improved health, hygiene, and community participatory practices.\n26. The draft sector framework recommends the following four strategic foci:\n(i)  A WS&S sector management and investment program would establish a Project\nManagement  Unit  (PMU)  and  prepare  a  detailed  program  implementation\ndocument.\n(ii)  A capacity building and institutional development program would establish the\nhuman and institutional framework necessary to complement the physical WS&S\nworks.\n(iii)  A WS&S implementation program would cover repair and rehabilitation of urban\nand rural WS&S across East Timor.\n(iv)  Environmental health promotion and strengthening of local NGOs would provide\ncomplementary  programs  for  health  promotion,  hygiene  education,  and\nstrengthening of local NGOs.\nIn  close  cooperation  with  the  East  Timorese,  other  donors,  and  stakeholders,  this\nframework and its four strategic foci will be reviewed, reassessed, and adjusted to current needs\nunder this Project.\n6. Sector Management\na. UNTAET\u2019s Water and Sanitation Authority (WSA)\n27.   East Timor's water and power sectors are currently being managed and coordinated by\nUNTAET's head of public utilities, a position that sits under the infrastructure portfolio. The\nvarious departments under the Cabinet Infrastructure group are public works; energy, water and\nsanitation; transport and communications; and National Institute of Cadaster and Geodesy. A\nWSA (previously Office of Water and Sanitation) draft strategic plan and an organization chart\nare in Appendix 3.\n28. The recently established NC is expected to form a number of sectoral committees to\nassist and advise the Cabinet. Those covering infrastructure, health, environment, and natural\nresources are most relevant to the WS&S sector. In designing any program of rehabilitation and\nreconstruction for East Timor, the NC and its relevant committees must be consulted and the\nviews and experience of its constituent members taken into account.", "8\n29. The WSA has recently been established as part of UNTAET\u2019s infrastructure portfolio under\nthe Public Utilities department. It is currently staffed by nine expatriate and 56 local personnel.\nThey are based in Dili, focusing on rehabilitation and operation of the town water supply system. A\nfurther 110 local staff are employed by district administrators in districts outside Dili working as\nwater  supply  field  staff,  pump  and  water  treatment  plant  operators,  and    performing  other\noperation and maintenance duties. WSA plans to establish a presence in the main district towns\nas soon as supervisory staff become available.\nb. UNTAET's WSA Policies and Plans\n30. Being in its early and formative stages, WSA is still developing policies and plans for the\nWS&S sector. WSA has already considered the type of national organizational structure that\nmight be appropriate for developing and managing WS&S in East Timor, and prepared a draft\nstrategic plan with the following mission statement:\nTo  ensure  the  communities  of  East  Timor  have  access  to  such  water  and\nsanitation services as are considered essential for public health, protection of the\nenvironment and for promotion of economic growth.\n31. The plan identifies seven key result areas and their objectives:\n(i) Policy and Planning: Plan, develop policy, and organize for the achievement of the\nmission statement. Measure and  report to Government on progress  to achieve  the  mission\nstatement.\n(ii) Water Resources: Assess, control the use of, and protect the water resources of\nEast Timor.\n(iii)  Public Water Supply: Provide adequate, safe, and sustainable water supplies for\nthe communities of Dili and major urban centers in the districts, with the long-term goal of full cost\nrecovery from users of the water supply services.\n(iv)  Community  Water  Supply:  Facilitate  at  the  national  level,  the  promotion  of\nadequate, safe, and sustainable water supplies for village communities through community-owned\nand -managed water supply systems.\n(v)  Sewage and Wastewater: Facilitate at the national level, the  safe disposal of\nsewage and wastewater in urban areas.\n(vi)  Urban Drainage: Facilitate at the national level, the collection and safe disposal of\nnuisance surface waters from major urban areas.\n(vii)  Solid Waste: Facilitate at the national level, the collection and safe disposal of solid\nand hazardous waste from major urban areas.\nD. External Assistance and Donor Coordination\n32. Details of committed and potential external assistance to the WS&S sector are given in\nAppendix 4.", "9\n1. Emergency Phase\n33. Postcrisis rehabilitation of both urban and rural water supplies is ongoing, with key inputs\nfrom ICRC, UN agencies, NGOs, Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), AusAID, and\nUNTAET through its district administration offices and WSA.  This work has been, and remains,\nfocused principally on emergency repairs to key water supply infrastructure and maintaining\nsystems in a fairly basic operating condition.\n34. International NGOs: ICRC, Care International, Oxfam International, Action Contra Faim,\nand local NGOs: Bia Hula, Forte, and Hamoris Timor Oan (HTO) are the main NGOs involved in\nthe WS&S sector. Supported by their internal resources and bilateral and multilateral donors, they\nhave been at the cutting edge of the emergency restoration phase, working on both urban and\nrural water supplies and, to a lesser extent, sanitation. The international NGOs have been, and\nare still, working very closely with UNTAET district administrations on operation and maintenance\nof urban water supply systems.  However, as the emergency phase comes to a conclusion, many\nhave expressed the desire to hand over the urban systems to UNTAET\u2019s WSA to allow the NGOs\nto concentrate more on rural development, which they consider to be their area of comparative\nadvantage.\n35. At the commencement of the humanitarian assistance phase, it was UNTAET\u2019s district\nadministrators,  with  assistance  from  NGOs  and  their  donors  that  commenced  WS&S\nemergency rehabilitation. They have engaged about 110 local staff (former employees of water\nentities) to undertake repairs, operation, and maintenance in a number of district towns outside\nDili. Now that the WSA is becoming better established, and the country is moving from the\nhumanitarian to the development phase, it is expected that WSA will systematically take over\nthe WS&S operations in major district town centres from NGOS. In the meantime, they are\nconcentrating on  repairs,  operation, and  maintenance of  the  Dili  water supply,  again  with\nassistance from  ICRC  and  others.  WSA  will  form  the  basis  for  a  new  water  supply  and\nsanitation authority in East Timor, and is now planning for that transformation.\n36. The United Nations International Children's Fund (UNICEF) has been involved in the\nemergency phase, supplying electric pumps and handpumps to peri-urban and rural areas in\ncooperation with NGOs. Activities based on their emergency funds from the European Community\nHumanitarian Organization will extend through until about November 2000. Thereafter, UNICEF\nhas developed plans to encourage local entrepreneurs, to promote hygiene education at the\nvillage level to encourage development and proper use of improved water supply and sanitation\nfacilities. They propose that the former system of Department of Health \"sanitarians\" be used as\ncatalysts in this process. Funding for this activity is being sought.\n2. Rehabilitation and Reconstruction\n37. Japan is currently completing, at a cost of about $2.0 million, asset mapping and water\nsupply master planning in 15 district towns, including Dili. It has also allocated about US$930,000\nfor a number of quick impact projects (e.g., repairs to the Manatuto transmission pipeline; leakage\ncontrol in Dili; and rehabilitation of water supply systems in 10 schools).  Additionally, the water-\ntesting  laboratory  established  during  the  master  planning  exercise  has  been  donated  to\nUNTAET's WSA. Further, the Japanese Government has proposed an allocation of some $10\nmillion for rehabilitation of the Dili water supply system.  Japanese consultants will implement this\nwork through United Nations Development Program (UNDP)-United Nations Office of Project\nServices (UNOPS). Dili water supply rehabilitation is planned for implementation over 2 years", "10\ncommencing about June 2000.  Japan is also reportedly considering funding rehabilitation of all\n14 town water supplies (in addition to Dili) in three consecutive packages of 4-5 towns each, with\nthe first package commencing in early 2001.\n38. The  Government  of  Portugal  has  committed  US$1.5  million  in  2000  for  repair  and\nrehabilitation of the Baucau and Aileu town systems, and to provide technical back-up support for\nthe organization and management of the proposed water authority for East Timor, as it affects\nareas in which Portugal is involved. The budget also covers preparation of a sanitation and\ndrainage master plan and a solid waste management plan, principally for Dili. Implementation of\nthis work has commenced through the auspices of UNDP-UNOPS.\n39. AusAID is also involved in the WS&S sector. During the emergency period,  AusAID\nsupported local and international NGOs (e.g., Bia Hula, Oxfam, Care, etc.) and provided a facility\nthrough the Northern Territory Department of Power and Water by which equipment and materials\nwere able to be procured quickly and technical assistance provided. AusAID is currently providing\nfurther technical assistance to WSA through staffing assistance and plans to continue supporting\nWSA and NGOs with technical assistance, training, and equipment. It has also expressed interest\nin  participating  in  WS&S  institutional  development,  capacity  building,  environmental  health\nprograms, and district WS&S implementation using the community participation approach. To this\nend, AusAID has allocated A$ 5.5 million for FY 2001 for the WS&S sector.  Specific activities will\nbe developed by a design team mission to be fielded in July or August 2000.\n3. Donor Coordination\n40. The Project  is fully  coordinated with donors involved  in  restoration and  rehabilitation\nsupport in the WS&S sector in East Timor. As restoration of the WS&S sector is essentially\nstarting anew, it is imperative that a clear and recognized system for  coordinating activities\nthroughout East Timor be established as soon as possible. Consequently, one of the principal\nobjectives of this Project is to facilitate establishment of an agreed program of work for repair,\nrehabilitation, and  management of WS&S  in East Timor. Such a program will then provide\nUNTAET and its development partners, including all donors and potential donors, with guidelines\nand a structure to coordinate their investments in the sector. WSA is the obvious focus for policy\nsetting, planning, coordination, management, monitoring, and evaluation of all WS&S activities,\nand is already preparing itself for this task. This Project will support WSA in its management and\ncoordination roles.\nIV. THE REHABILITATION ASSISTANCE\nA. Rationale\n41. UNTAET is executing a program of humanitarian assistance in East Timor, part of which\ninvolves  rehabilitation  of  WS&S  facilities  damaged  during  the  September  1999  crisis.  The\nchallenge, however, is not just a matter of restoring the facilities to their precrisis status, but to\nmake sure sustainability and cost recovery can be achieved in the postcrisis environment. All\nformer WS&S institutions are now defunct; offices, stores, equipment, workshops, and records\nwere  removed,  burned,  or  otherwise  destroyed;  and  most  managerial  and  administrative\npersonnel have departed East Timor.  Added to this is the fact that the standard of most precrisis\nwater supply and sanitation facilities throughout the country,  both  urban  and rural,  was  well\nbelow  commonly  accepted  levels. UNTAET  is  faced  not  just  with  making  some perfunctory\nrepairs.  It must (i) establish completely new institutional arrangements for WS&S; (ii) develop,\nfrom  a  low base,  the  human  capacity  to manage,  operate,  and  maintain  the systems; (iii)", "11\nrehabilitate  and  reconstruct  WS&S  facilities  to  acceptable standards  and  levels  of   service;\nand  (iv) at  the  same  time,  prepare for transition to East Timorese self-government. The ADB\nmission estimated the total needs to rehabilitate the WS&S sector at US$39.9 million; however,\nwith current TFET funds being allocated across various sectors, an amount of only US$4.5 million\ncan be made available for the FY 2001. Discussions with UNTAET and the TFET trustee indicate\nthat more funds may become available in FY 2002, in which case a follow-up project will be\ndeveloped.\n42. The Project\u2019s overall strategic goal is to provide the people of East Timor with adequate,\naffordable, and sustainable WS&S services using appropriate technology and good management\nsystems. It will do this by (i) building local capacity and capability to effectively manage the WS&S\nsector; (ii) rehabilitating and reconstructing water supply and sanitation facilities in urban and rural\ncommunities;  and  (iii)  promoting  improved  environmental  health,  hygiene,  and  community\nparticipatory practices.\nB. Objectives\n43. The Project will (i) develop a WS&S sector management and investment program, which\nincludes the establishment of a PMU under UNTAET's WSA and the preparation of a detailed,\nbudgeted PID for coordinated improvement of East Timor's WS&S sector; (ii) implement a\ncapacity building and institutional development program that will identify and implement priority\nactivities  to  support  physical  construction  already  under  way  or  being  planned,  and  to\ncomplement  capacity  and  institutional  development  activities  by  other  donors;  and  (iii)\ncommence implementation of the WS&S implementation program that will include (a) a WSA\nWS&S Quick Response Facility, (b) complementary works for the Dili Water Supply Repair and\nRehabilitation already underway by other donors, and (c) complementary works for the District\nWater Supply Repair and Rehabilitation already under way by other donors.\nC. Scope\n44. The Project has three components.\n1. Component 1: WS&S Sector Management and Investment Program\n45. The  purpose  of  this  component  is  to  quickly  establish  an  integrated  WS&S  sector\nmanagement  and  investment  program  for  East  Timor.  Preparatory  arrangements,  including\ntentative recruitment and logistical planning will be undertaken by UNTAET (WSA) to enable work\nto commence in East Timor on or about 1 September 2000. Component 1 comprises two parts.\nThe first is to establish a PMU under UNTAET\u2019s WSA to assist with program implementation. The\nsecond part is to prepare a detailed work program to guide PMU activities over the next year and\nbeyond.  The  work  program  will  be  prepared  over  three  months  between  September  and\nDecember  2000.  Key  activities  of  the  work  program  will  include  infrastructure  repair  and\nrehabilitation, preparation of  integrated plans for human resources  development,  institutional\ndevelopment, tariff proposals, asset management policies and procedures, WS&S standards,\nmanagement and financial information system, legal and regulatory framework, community and\ngender development, environmental health and hygiene promotion, water resources protection,\nand the transition from UNTAET to East Timorese self-rule. The outcome will be a detailed,\nbudgeted PID for coordinated improvement of East Timor\u2019s WS&S sector. These documents will\nguide  WSA  and  the  PMU  in  program  implementation  as  well  as  overall  coordination  and\nmanagement of the WS&S sector in East Timor.", "12\n2. Component 2: Capacity-Building and Institutional Development Program\n46. The Project will, in coordination with WSA and relevant bilateral donors, identify and\nimplement priority capacity building and institutional development activities.  These activities will\nbe specifically designed to support physical WS&S construction already completed, under way, or\nplanned, and complement capacity-building and institutional development activities by donors.\nDetails and priorities will be identified in the PID. Capacity-building and institutional development\nactivities  include  support  for  the  WS&S  quick  response  facility  (para.  47);  rehabilitation  of\nworkshops, stores, generator sheds, and other infrastructure essential to WS operations; and\nprocurement of supplies, equipment, communications, and other facilities fundamental to water\nand sanitation operation. Special attention will be given to the capacity-building and institutional\ndevelopment needs of Dili, Baucau, Aileu, and other priority towns.\n3. Component 3: Water Supply and Sanitation Implementation Program\na. Component 3.1: WSA WS&S Quick Response Facility\n47. The  quick  response  facility  will  be  utilized  to  support  WSA  in  undertaking  urgent,\nsubstantial repairs to, and rehabilitation of, water supplies across all 13 districts of East Timor.\nBecause the use of the facility will be determined by need, it is designed to be sufficiently flexible\nto respond promptly to urgent needs as they emerge. This is vital in the postcrisis environment of\nEast Timor, where the people\u2019s needs go beyond all developmental norms. In this unique setting,\nthe Project has an obligation to ensure that its approach is designed not to exacerbate the social\nand human problems already faced by the East Timorese people. The ability to respond rapidly to\nthe people\u2019s urgent water supply needs is seen as a positive expression of recognition, by the\nProject, of their dire situation. Likely activities which the facility will undertake include procurement\nof pipes, fittings, and other water supply componentry; local contracts to undertake substantial\nrepairs  and  rehabilitation;  and  related  procurement  transport,  earthmoving  and  excavation\nservices. The key purpose of the facility is to provide WSA with the capacity to quickly respond to\nthe East Timorese people\u2019s most urgent water supply repair and rehabilitation needs. Allowance\nhas been made for the facility to operate for 10 months from 1 September 2000.\nb. Component 3.2: Dili Water Supply Repair and Rehabilitation\n48. The Japanese government has proposed to allocate US$10 million for the Dili Water\nSupply & Sanitation Rehabilitation Design and Construction Project. Implementation of the water\nsupply element will be by UNDP-UNOPS through a Japanese  consulting firm.  This  work  is\nexpected to commence around mid-2000 and extend over two years. Works proposed include\nimproving  the  main  raw  water  source;  strengthening  the  raw  water  transmission  pipeline;\nexpanding the water treatment plant at Bemos; and completing minor work on the treated water\ntransmission main. TFET Project funding, among others, has been allocated for complementary\nworks that include network rehabilitation and zoning near the transmission main from the Bemos\nwater treatment plant; replacement of unserviceable asbestos-cement mains in central Dili where\nhigh leakage occurs, and associated/connecting pipework; and urban and periurban low-income\nworks such as repairs and rehabilitation of public taps and other watering points. Actual works will\nbe determined by WSA in conjunction with the Japanese-funded project managers to maximize\nthe synergy of the respective works.  The aim of this component is to build on the upstream works\nby Japan, by improving water service to customers and expanding the number of customers\nserved as an essential prelude to system sustainability.", "13\n49. Additionally, there are other areas of Dili\u2019s water supply system outside the influence of the\nJapanese funded works that will benefit greatly from TFET funding. For example, in a number of\ninstances, rehabilitation of deep bores and associated pumps and distribution systems would\ndirectly benefit some thousands of people. Such areas would be identified and, depending on\nWSA priorities, considered for TFET funding under component 3.2.\n50. Allowance  has been  made for such  complementary and supplementary  rehabilitation\nworks to be carried out over a nine months period from 1 October 2000.\nc. Component 3.3: District Water Supply Repair and Rehabilitation\n51. The district water supply and sanitation program is designed to address the needs of\nsmaller urban and rural communities throughout the 13 districts of East Timor.  While the system\nrepair of major district towns can be implemented individually, if necessary, it is proposed that\nsmaller town and village systems be managed as programs and implemented geographically as\ndistricts,  or  groups  of  districts.  This  approach  will  provide  flexibility  within  the  emerging\ngovernance and community capacity strategies currently being developed under the Community\nEmpowerment and Local Governance Project and should make the logistics of implementation\nmuch easier. The opportunity also then exists for  interested donors to undertake town and\ncommunity WS&S development within one or more districts, to enhance logistics and improve\ndonor coordination.  Within each district, it is expected that a coordinated approach to addressing\nsustainable WS&S equitably between towns and villages will be developed utilizing processes of\nenvironmental health, gender awareness, and community participation and planning. Interested\ndonors may package district WS&S programs to suit their circumstances, and implement them by\nmanaging  agents  working  in  partnership  with  local  and  international  NGOs  and  community\ngroups.\n52. In support of this program, the Project has allowed funding to address the most urgent\nneeds of a number of those districts, and those that are not receiving bilateral assistance.  Exact\npriorities will need to be identified by UNTAET when donor intentions are firmer, but current\nindications from the East Timorese counterparts suggest that the border districts of Kova-Lima,\nBobonaro, and Oecusse, where destruction was greatest, are of high priority for TFET or donor\nsupport. Liquica District too has been identified as an area of much need, where repair and\nrehabilitation works could yield quick and effective results. As an example, in Liquica township,\nthe  primary  river  intake  and  transmission  pipeline  is  extensively  damaged  and  is  now\nunserviceable.  A potential alternative to repairing the transmission main would be to rehabilitate\nexisting (but non-operational) bores as a new raw water source. The PID will include a detailed\nand prioritized list for funding under component 3.3. Typically, works to be undertaken under\ncomponent 3.3 include procurement and installation of pipes, fittings, pumps, motors, generators,\nand supply of construction materials; contracts for design services for small- and medium-scale\nwater supply engineering works; hiring of construction equipment and transport; development of\ncontracts for rehabilitation of water bores; rehabilitation of raw water intakes; and provision of\nsupport services such as water quality testing and groundwater pumping tests.\n53. Allowance has been made for these complementary works to be carried out over nine\nmonths from 1 October 2000.", "14\nD. Cost Estimates\n54. The total cost of the Project is estimated at US$4.50 million equivalent, and includes all\ncosts from September 2000 until the end of UNTAET's FY 2001. Table 3 provides a summary of\nthe cost estimates for the Project, which are outlined in more detail in Appendix 5.\nTable 3: Summary of Project Costs\n(US$ million)\nComponents Total Cost\nA.

Financing Plan\n55. The  total  cost  of  the  Project  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  out  of  the  TFET.\nContributions to the TFET do not include ADB resources.6\n56. The joint assessment mission7 assessed that WS&S restoration over the three years\n2000-2003, will cost US$22.2 million. These estimates have been reassessed by the ADB\nmission and are now expected to cost US$39.9 million, with approximately US$12million-15\nmillion coming from TFET funds and the remaining balance from other funding sources.\n                                                       \n6  An amount of US$ 4.5 million has been earmarked in the TFET budget for FY 2001 for the WS&S sector.\n7  The mission was coordinated by the World Bank and undertook its fieldwork from 26 October to 12 November\n1999. ADB participated in the mission, along with a number of other bilateral and multilateral aid agencies. East\nTimorese counterparts also participated in each of the mission's sector teams.", "15\n57. The Project only covers initial rehabilitation of the WS&S sector for  10-15  months,\ncommencing 1 September 2000. It is expected that a broader TFET-funded WS&S rehabilitation\nproject will be developed for the next two fiscal years (1 July 2001-30 June 2003) if more TFET\nfunds become available in FY 2002 for this purpose.\nF. Executing Agency\n58. UNTAET will be the recipient of the grant from the TFET. It will establish a PMU within\nWSA that reports to the UNTAET Infrastructure Cabinet Member, through the head of public\nutilities via the head of WSA. The PMU will program, administer, and coordinate daily project\nactivities. All activities will be done in close cooperation with WSA, multi- and bilateral donors,\nNGOs, community groups, and other stakeholders.  In particular, works and activities funded out\nof the TFET will be fully integrated with donor-funded activities and projects. The PMU will be\nfunded under the Project. The PMU will be headed by an East Timorese project manager (WS&S\nengineer) and comprise an East Timorese project accountant and one community development\nspecialist. The selection of these will be subject to ADB approval. Two internationally recruited\nconsultants will support the project manager: a chief technical adviser (CTA) and a community\ndevelopment specialist. Total international consulting comprises 37.5 person-months: 20 person-\nmonths for the PMU and 17.5 for preparation of the PID. The CTA will support the project\nmanager in administering the Project and its contracts in accordance with ADB guidelines. The\nCTA and community development specialist, in coordination with WSA staff, will program and\ncoordinate  daily  project  activities,  including  design,  supervision,  procurement  of  goods  and\nservices, and management of civil works contracts. The international consultants will train East\nTimorese counterparts in their area of responsibility. An organization chart of the PMU, and terms\nof reference of the PMU and the consulting team for preparation of the PID are in Appendix 6.\nUnder the organization framework of UNTAET, the PMU will be an integral part of WSA and be\nabsorbed within it.\nG. Implementation Arrangements\n1. Technical Approach\n59. Where  possible,  the  works  under  the  Project  will  incorporate  labor-intensive,\nemployment-generating  methodologies.  Least-cost  methodologies  will  be  adopted  for  the\ntechnical solutions. These include maximum use of local labor, materials, and contractors, and\nsimple technologies contributing to sustainability of these works.\n2. Steering Committee\n60. UNTAET  will  establish  a  project  steering  committee  involving  broader  stakeholder\nrepresentation in project implementation. The steering committee will be convened prior to project\nimplementation to inform the stakeholders of project activities. The steering committee will then\nmeet  monthly  to  discuss  and  resolve  emerging  project  implementation,  procurement,  and\ncommunity issues, and to review and comment on the project reports for submission to ADB.\n3. Procurement of Goods and Services\n61. All procurement under the Project will be conducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines\nfor Procurement.  The proceeds of the Project will finance imports of goods and services, local\npurchases, and civil works identified under the Project. Under ADB Guidelines, these may be\nprocured off the shelf, or through international shopping, local competitive bidding, or international", "16\ncompetitive bidding, as appropriate. The PMU and WSA will coordinate with the donor community\nto ensure, as far as possible, that materials and equipment are compatible and of appropriate\ntechnology and quality; that spare parts are readily available at a fair price; and that common\nstandards and levels of service are used in all WS&S projects in East Timor. Consulting services\nwill be selected in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.\n62. The term member countries under these guidelines for purposes of this Project will include\nADB member countries, East Timor, and all donors and members of international organizations\nthat have contributed funds to the TFET.8\n4. Implementation Schedule\n63. The project will be implemented over 10-15 months, commencing in September 2000 and\nfinishing in June 2001. Every quarter, the PMU will prepare a detailed implementation schedule\nfor  project  activities.  Selection  of  project  implementation  consultants  and  contractors  will\ncommence in accordance with activity priorities in the implementation schedule, upon project\napproval, and when the Grant Agreement is signed.  The concurrent first priorities are to establish\nthe PMU and for the consulting team to prepare the PID. Significant advance preparation by WSA\nis planned to ensure these teams are fielded by September 2000. The consulting team will\nprepare a detailed PID with an updated implementation schedule, establish real and realistic\npriorities, and refine cost estimates. The PID will cover three years, 2000-2003, in detail. The\ninitial project implementation schedule is shown in Appendix 7.\n5. Rights-of-Way\n64. UNTAET has stated that most of the works under the Project are within existing rights-of-\nway. UNTAET will, if needed, acquire or obtain rights to any land required on a timely basis in\naccordance with ADB's resettlement policy9 and provide compensation (including for crops), as\nrequired,  in accordance with ADB\u2019s  relevant guidelines.  Detailed designs  will  minimize  land\nacquisition. It is expected that the Project will not require any resettlement.\n6. Disbursement Procedures\n65. As agreed upon by IDA, disbursements for eligible expenditures will be made pursuant to\nADB\u2019s disbursement guidelines set out in ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook and may be made\nas direct payment or reimbursement, or through an imprest account. The imprest account will be\nreplenished in accordance with the handbook. The CTA will be responsible for transactions,\nreplenishments, and use of the imprest account. Payments under these agreements will be made\nby IDA, based on ADB\u2019s request.\n7. Direct Payment\n66. Under the direct purchase procedure, the PMU will ask ADB for a direct payment to be\nmade to the supplier of goods and services. ADB will authorize the request and send it to IDA,\nwhich will pay the supplier directly.  Payment will be requested using ADB\u2019s standard withdrawal\n                                                       \n8 R74-00: Joint Management Arrangements for the Trust Fund for East Timor, 23 March 2000 \u2013 an arrangement for\nthe TFET and an expansion of eligibility under ADB\u2019s procurement and consulting services guidelines to include\nmember countries, East Timor, and all donors and members of international organizations that have provided\ncontribution funds to the TFET.\n9 ADB, 1989. The Bank's Policy on Involuntary Resettlement, Appendix 1 in Handbook on Resettlement.\nManila.", "17\napplication.  The PMU will indicate in the withdrawal application the date on which payment\nbecomes due to the supplier. A separate application should be filled out for each currency in\nwhich the payment is requested. The application should be submitted with supporting documents\nsuch as contracts, invoices, receipts, and vouchers. This procedure will be used for payment of (i)\nconsultants'  fees,  and  (ii)  equipment  and  civil  works  contracts  awarded  on  the  basis  of\ninternational competitive bidding. Copies of signed contracts will be forwarded to ADB as early as\npossible to facilitate timely payments.\n8. Reimbursement Procedures\n67. The reimbursement procedure will be used when eligible expenditures are paid from\nUNTAET\u2019s  budget  and  reimbursement  claimed  through  ADB  from  the  TFET.  Withdrawal\napplications with supporting documents and summary sheets of expenditures will be prepared by\nthe PMU, and payments will be made to UNTAET by IDA based on ADB\u2019s authorization. The\nreimbursement procedure will be used for payment of (i) small purchases and (ii) short-term civil\nworks contracts.\n9. Imprest Fund\n68. Under the imprest account fund procedure, ADB will ask IDA to advance funds to the PMU\nto meet subproject expenditures to prefinance payments to contractors and suppliers. The imprest\naccount will be used for short-term civil works, small-scale design and supervision services,\nremuneration of East Timorese staff, and small purchases under all cost categories eligible for\nfinancing.  ADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditure  procedure  will  be  used  for  reimbursement  of\nexpenditures and for the liquidation of the imprest account for payments with value equal to or\nbelow US$10,000 each. The currency of the imprest account will be the US dollar and the\nmaximum initial advance will be US$450,000. The CTA supported by the PMU will be responsible\nfor administrative and accounting tasks under the Project and will establish adequate internal\ncontrol, accounting, and audit procedures to ensure efficient use of the imprest account and its\noperation. The imprest account will be established in Darwin, Australia or in Dili, East Timor,\nsubject to ADB's approval.\n10. Reporting\n69. UNTAET, with the support of the PMU, will furnish ADB with quarterly progress reports\nconcerning all aspects, including finances, procurement of services, equipment, and all civil works\nin the Project, including bilateral activities. The PMU will prepare quarterly expenditure budgets a\nmonth prior to the commencement of the following quarter. UNTAET, with the support of the PMU,\nwill also provide quarterly reports on the use of the recurrent UNTAET water and sanitation\nbudget,  including  activities  and  expenditures;  and  report  progress  in  implementing  policy\ninitiatives, WS&S regulations, and organizational changes. The PMU will also prepare a final\nproject  completion  report  on  all  aspects  of  the  Project  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  relevant\nguidelines one month prior to physical completion of the Project.\n11. Accounts\n70. The PMU will establish the necessary accounts in Dili, if possible, and in Darwin, Australia\nif required.  These bank accounts will be under the control of the CTA.  The PMU will establish\nand maintain separate accounts for all eligible expenditures under the  Project,  including  its\nindividual contracts and other project components.  The PMU will furnish ADB with accounts and\nrelated  financial  statements  prepared  in  accordance  with  international  or  other  appropriate", "18\naccounting standards. Auditors acceptable to ADB will then audit these financial statements. The\naudited financial statements together with the auditor\u2019s report will be forwarded to ADB within six\nmonths of the end of each fiscal year.  The PMU consultants will keep detailed records on the\ncosting and expenditures of the project components and will assist with reporting.\n12. Technical Midterm Review\n71. In addition to a schedule of regular reviews to monitor project progress, a technical review\nof the Project will be carried out six months after mobilization. The focus of the review is to\ndetermine the need for any adjustment of the project design or implementation. The review will\nalso assess adequacy of funds, cost overruns, need for reallocations, and other factors, if any,\nincluding  assumptions  and  risks, that  might  constrain the  satisfactory  implementation of  the\nProject and achievement of development objectives.\nH. Environmental and Social Measures\n1. Environmental Aspects\n72. The Project has been classified as environmental Category B.  An initial environmental\nexamination was conducted and is reported in Appendix 8. The Project will only involve minor\nconstruction, and as such, transient environmental disturbances normally experienced during\nconstruction will be insignificant. Typical environmental disturbances related to water supply and\nsanitation  will  include  minor  excavations  to  replace  pipes  and  fittings  and  repair  drains;\ntemporary road and street closures to allow pipe and drain replacement; minor clearing along\nshort lengths of existing pipeline routes to allow repairs and rehabilitation; clearing of small\nareas (up to 20 square meters) for drill rig and truck access to bore sites; and minor short-term\nassociated  soil  erosion  if  works  are  undertaken  in  high  rainfall  periods.  Most  of  these\ndisturbances will be on public land, and extend over only a day or two. Their impact will be\ngenerally limited to 10 to 100 square meters. Other works of significance include the proposed\nrepair and rehabilitation of water supply-related structures such as workshops, stores, generator\nrooms, storage tanks, and borehole housing. All these works will be carried out on sites of\nexisting (damaged) structures and no significant environmental effects are foreseen other than\nnormal  small  building  construction  activities  such  as  cartage  of  building  materials  and\nconstruction noise. Again any effects will be small and temporary, possibly lasting from a few\ndays to  a few  weeks.  The only  significant  adverse  operational  impact  is  that  of  potential\nincrease in local discharge of wastewater because of improved water supplies. This will be\nameliorated through repair and rehabilitation of drainage systems in problematic areas. Any\nother potential or identified adverse effects will be preempted or minimized by (i) improving\nwater  resource  management  and  (ii)  increasing  promotion  of  environmental  conservation\nthrough community participation and education activities. Thus, while there will be some minor\nand  transient environmental  impacts, the  medium-  and  long-term  impact  of  the  Project  is\npositive, especially in promoting economic and social development of East Timor and facilitating\nits  reconstruction  and  development.  A  detailed  environmental  impact  assessment  is  not\nrequired.\n73. Due to the postconsultation destruction, the environmental conditions in urban areas of\nEast Timor are quite poor. The damage to water supplies and sanitation is now endangering\npopulations through pervasive waterborne diseases and lack of sanitation. People are spending\nexcessive time collecting water, with the resulting inconvenience. The environmental costs of\nimplementing the Project are minimal and transient, generally  relating to the minor  physical\nimpacts expected when damaged pipes, buildings, and the like are repaired and rehabilitated. The", "19\nenvironmental and social benefits of the Project are, however, significant and include (i) providing\nthe means for improved WS&S, and (ii) upgrading the quality of life for people in both urban and\nrural areas whose attempts to improve their status and health are continually impeded by the\nneed to divert time, energy, and financial resources to acquire their daily water needs. The Project\nwill generate employment through local labor, thus helping to create a stable social and economic\nenvironment. Although previous WS&S activities were generally undertaken with little regard for\nenvironmental procedures, nevertheless repair and rehabilitation works carried out under the\nProject will ensure that proper and appropriate environmental practices are observed. The Project\nwill ensure adequate environmental procedures and monitoring mechanisms are established, and\nduring works and construction, care will be taken to minimize disruption to the environment.\n74. Environmental monitoring will be under the guidance of the PMU. In addition to regular\ninspections of works to ensure that all possible mitigation measures have been taken, the PMU\nwill  (i)  measure  the  effectiveness  of  any  environmental  improvements  needed,  (ii)  identify\nproblems  that  may  arise  during  the  works  and,  if  necessary,  (iii)  provide  ecological  audit\ninformation for future works of this nature. The proposed monitoring will be designed to quantify\nthe  benefits  gained  and  any  impacts  sustained  from  repairing  and  rehabilitating  town  and\ncommunity WS&S systems. Environmental parameters to be monitored will be defined by the\nPMU, and will include raw water quality, treated water quality, delivered water quality, need for\nand  effectiveness  of  drainage  systems,  water  pressure  in  piped  systems,  environmental\nconditions in river and spring catchments including pollution and land clearing, landslide and\nerosion problems affecting water supply and sanitation facilities, efficiency and effectiveness of\nsanitation facilities, and growth of algae in reservoirs. WSA will be responsible for all water quality\ntesting (chemical and bacteriological) using the water-testing laboratory facility recently donated\nby the Government of Japan. They will also be responsible, in cooperation with local communities,\nfor monitoring construction and postconstruction environmental aspects of the Project. The PMU\nwill liaise with WSA and the Interim Health Authority to monitor environmental health statistics as\npart of the Project\u2019s focus on environmental health education and promotion of safe domestic\nhygiene practices.\n75. Under  UNTAET,  Indonesian  environmental  laws  remain  valid,  although  their\nimplementation capacity will need to be developed. UNTAET is presently reviewing environmental\nlaws, regulations, and standards, and these may be applied to the Project in the future, although it\nis expected that this will not result in any adverse outcomes. Conversely, the PMU and WSA will\ncompile project environmental  reports,  the  information from which  will  be passed on to the\nrelevant section of UNTAET for consideration when developing environmental standards and\nlegislation.\n2.  Social Issues\n76. The Project will rehabilitate impaired WS&S services. An initial social assessment has\nbeen prepared in accordance with  ADB's Guidelines for Social Dimensions of Infrastructure\nProjects and is attached as Appendix 9. The Project is expected to have a significant positive\nsocial impact. The Project will involve no relocation or resettlement. The beneficiary consultations\nconfirmed widespread support for the Project. The Project will improve the quality of life by\nproviding the means for improved sanitation and reducing labor times for water fetching. Project\nconstruction activities will generate significant employment opportunities, and delivered services\nwill free the labor force for more productive uses.", "20\nI. Project Justification\n77. The Project will have a positive social impact on the East Timorese population, particularly\nthe poor. It will provide safe water and sanitation to a large part of the population. Ready access to\nsafe WS&S services will have significant long-term benefits in terms of reduction of waterborne\ndiseases including diarrhea, dysentery, malaria, and skin diseases. It will also contribute to human\ncapital development and reduce poverty through the ability to put labor used for water fetching to\nmore productive uses. The Project will maximize the use of local contractors in its repair and\nrehabilitation works, thereby creating jobs at the local level. And it will help to develop sector\npolicies and institutional frameworks in which WS&S are delivered so that they take account of the\nneeds of the poor.\n78. Following the complete destruction of all water-related infrastructure, it can be assumed\nthat the net economic benefits will be positive, especially in the urban areas where it is expected\nthat  tariff schemes will eventually be introduced. In the rural areas, the freeing of labor for more\nproductive economic uses and the reduction in health-related costs are expected to result in this\nProject being net economically positive.\n79. A key lesson is that in all aspects of WS&S project design, construction, operation, and\nmaintenance,  the  focus  must  be  on  striving  for  sustainable  solutions.  Experience  in  many\ncountries over many years has shown that the traditional least-cost approach to planning water\nsupply projects is inadequate to achieve sustainable resource use efficiency. What is required is\nan approach that integrates both supply- and demand-side concerns, and accounts for nonmarket\ncosts and benefits. The extent to which benefits from water supply are likely to be sustained will\ndepend upon greater recognition of the role that prices can play in managing water demand,\nexpanding supply, and conserving the environment. The PID will address the establishment of,\nand improvement in, tariff levels and structures under this Project; this will ensure differential tariff\nregimes for different customer segments, some degree of cost recovery, and sustainability of\nservices.\nJ. Impact on Extreme Poverty\n80. Even before the 1999 destruction and displacement, East Timor was one of the poorest\nareas in Southeast Asia.  Based on Indonesian statistics, prior to the upheaval, social indicators in\nEast Timor already demonstrated a low level of human development, with some 50 percent of the\npopulation clustered around the poverty line.  The situation has worsened dramatically since\nSeptember 1999.\n81. ADB\u2019s core development tenet is one of combating poverty. Its commitment in East\nTimor is to provide well-coordinated action to support reconstruction and long-term development\nplanning, as well as humanitarian relief. This includes working to reduce poverty, with particular\nattention  to  ensuring  quality  basic  service  delivery;  opportunities  for  productive  sector\ndevelopment; and provision of associated infrastructure needs.\n82. Prior to the upheaval, less than half the population had access to  safe  water  and\nsanitation facilities. Sanitation practices, which were often unhygienic, were constrained by the\nabsence of sufficient water. There were major health hazards caused by the lack of sanitation\nfacilities in poorer rural and urban areas. Poor households were further disadvantaged by\nhaving limited access to basic health and education services. With almost the entire East Timor\npopulation suffering from the destruction, the need for repair and rehabilitation of water supplies\nand sanitation facilities is now even higher.", "21\n83. The Water Supply and Sanitation Rehabilitation Project directly addresses, and seeks to\novercome, a number of factors that directly, or indirectly, contribute to poverty. The Project is\ndesigned to distribute its benefits in an equitable manner across East Timorese urban and rural\ncommunities, be responsive to communities\u2019 needs, contribute to sustainable development and\noperation in the WS&S sector, reduce poverty, and minimize environmental impacts. It will\ntarget communities where need is greatest and where poorer people live (rural villages and peri-\nurban areas).  It will take account of the different needs of men and women and of the old and\nyoung. And where applicable it will adopt approaches to WS&S that counteract the problems\nfaced by poor households because of service charges. In all areas, repair and rehabilitation of\nwater supplies will free labor (both men and women) for more productive uses, thereby assisting\nin the fight against poverty. Improved sanitation facilities and practices, and the provision of\nclean water will have beneficial health effects, particularly for children and infants, and reduce\nthe costs associated with disease and morbidity. This particularly benefits the poor for whom the\ncosts of illness can be devastating.\nV. APPROVAL\n84.

Strategic Plan\n1. UNTAET\u2019s Water and Sanitation Authority (WSA) has prepared a draft strategic plan for\nestablishment of a governmental water and sanitation institution for East Timor. Regulations\ncovering  various  aspects  of  the  WSA  operations  are  gradually  being  developed  and\nimplemented.  The  guiding  policies  used  in  developing  the  plan  are  the  internationally\nrecognized \"Dublin Water Principles,\" which in simple terms state: Water should be considered\na  scarce and  limited  resource;  it  is  a public  good,  and has  an  economic  value  in all  its\ncompeting uses; it should be managed at the lowest appropriate level in the community.\n1. Stakeholders in the WS&S Sector\n2. Stakeholders with an interest in water and sanitation in East Timor include all urban and\nrural  communities  (customers);  future  East  Timor  government  institutions:  WS&S;  Health;\nEnvironment;  Local  Government;  etc.;  Conselho  Nacional  Resistencia  Timorense  (CNRT);\nUNTAET and its relevant offices; local and international nongovernment organizations (NGOs);\ninternational donors; and private sector organizations that will supply and service the sector.\n2. Mission Statement and Key Result Areas\n3. UNTAET has proposed the following mission statement and identified the following key\nresult areas (KRAs) as the foundation for the draft strategic plan:\nMission Statement: To ensure the communities of East Timor have access to\nsuch water and sanitation services as are considered essential for public health,\nprotection of the environment, and promotion of economic growth\n4. The following are KRAs.  These are areas which, if not managed appropriately by the\nnew W&S  institution,  will  lessen the  institution\u2019s  effectiveness,  and  diminish  its  service  to\ncustomers: Policy and Planning, Water Resources, Public Water Supply, Community Water\nSupply, Sewage and Wastewater, Urban Drainage, Solid Waste Management.\n3. Levels of Service\n5. The plan identifies levels of service considered appropriate for each of the KRAs. For\npublic  water  supplies, for  example,  service  minimum  pressure,  peak  demand  level,  water\nquality, and  response time  (to supply failure)  have  been  defined.  For community water\nsupplies, it is proposed that individual communities will determine  their own levels of service\nthrough a community participatory process involving public health considerations.  For sewage,\nwastewater,  and  urban  drainage,  levels  of  service  will  be  locally  determined  based  on\nappropriate national regulations.", "49\nAppendix 3, page 2\nB. Organization Structure \u2013 Service Delivery\n11. The location of the current WSA within UNTAET is shown in the attached organization\ncharts. UNTAET's public utilities \u2013 water and power \u2013 are managed and coordinated by the\nhead of public utilities, a position that sits in the infrastructure portfolio. The various departments\nunder the Cabinet Infrastructure group are public works, energy, water and sanitation, transport\nand communications, and the National Institute of Cadaster and Geodesy.\n12.

Project Response to Draft Strategic Plan\n13. Component 1.2 of the Project includes a reexamination of the draft strategic plan in\nconjunction with detailed studies of institutional development and capacity building and other\nkey components of the WS&S sector in East Timor.  This will be done in a fully participatory way\ninvolving all relevant stakeholders. Output from this work will constitute a solid plan for future\nmanagement, development, and direction of the WS&S sector.", "Figure A3.1: EAST TIMOR TRANSITIONAL GOVERNMENT\nTransitional Administrator\nand Special Representative of\nNational\nthe Secretary General\nHumanitarian\nCouncil\n(SRSG) Assistance\nDeputy Transitional\nInspector\nComprises 33 members (13 Administrator\nDistrict Reps, 7 CNRT, 3 from General\nother political parties, and 1\nrepresentative each from: Human Rights\nNational Planning and\nyouth/students, Women's groups,\nEnvironment Unit\nTimorese NGO forum, Catholic\nGender Affairs\nChurch, Protestant Church,\nMuslim community, professional\nCentral Payments\nassociations, Farmers, Labor,\nLegal Counsel\nBusiness) Office\n5\n0\nCABINET\nPolice  and Justice Political Finance Internal Infrastructure Economic Social\nEmergency Affairs Administration Affairs Affairs\nServices\nInt.

Project Management Unit\n1. A project management unit (PMU) will be established within the UNTAET\u2019s Water and\nSanitation  Authority  (WSA).  It  will  manage,  administer,  monitor  and  undertake  ongoing\nevaluation of the range of water supply, sanitation, and related project activities proposed.  It will\nalso assist WSA in its sectoral coordination and monitoring roles, and cooperate with other\nwater supply and sanitation (WS&S) projects and activities funded by bilateral and multilateral\ndonors.\n2.

In September 1999, East Timor experienced a campaign of destruction and terror over\nwhich three quarters of the population fled their homes and most of the country\u2019s infrastructure\nand private homes were destroyed. The widespread destruction included looting, burning, and\ndamage to town and village water supplies and sanitation facilities throughout the country.\nTypically  in  towns  with  public  water  supply  systems,  vehicles,  pumps,  and  motors  were\nremoved; water treatment plants damaged; offices, stores and other buildings burned; pipelines,\ntools and spare parts stolen; storage tanks ruptured; latrines and septic tanks damaged; and\nwater sources impaired. And in the burning of houses, water connections, including meters,\nwere completely destroyed. None of the former water supply or sanitation institutions now exist.\nTherefore  it  is  essential  to  support  physical  repair  and  rehabilitation;  and  develop  new\ninstitutions and systems for managing, operating, maintaining, and developing urban and rural\nwater supplies in East Timor that are both appropriate and sustainable.\n2. Objectives\n3. The Project\u2019s goal is to provide the people of East Timor with adequate, affordable, and\nsustainable water supply and sanitation (WS&S) services using appropriate technology and\ngood management systems. It will do this by (i) building local capacity to effectively manage the\nWS&S sector; (ii) rehabilitating and reconstructing water supply and sanitation facilities in urban\nand  rural  communities;  and  (iii)  promoting  improved  environmental  health,  hygiene,  and\ncommunity participatory practices.\n3. Description\n4. The Project will (i) develop a WS&S sector management and investment program, which\nincludes establishment  of  a  project  management  unit  (PMU)  under  UNTAET\u2019s Water  and\nSanitation Authority (WSA), and preparation of a detailed, budgeted program implementation\ndocument (PID) for coordinated improvement of East Timor\u2019s WS&S Sector, (ii) implement a\ncapacity  building  and  institutional  development  program  which  will  identify  and  implement\npriority activities to support physical reconstruction already under way or being planned, and to\ncomplement  capacity-building  and  institutional  development  activities by  other  donors, and\n(iii) commence  a  WS&S implementation program, comprising (a) WSA WS&S quick response\nfacility,  (b)  complementary  works  or  the  Dili  water  supply  repair  and  rehabilitation already", "78\nAppendix 8, page 2\nunder way by other donors, and (c) complementary works for the district water supply repair and\nrehabilitation already under way by other donors.\n5. The immediate benefits of the Project include (i) providing the means for improved\nWS&S and (ii) upgrading the quality of life for people in both urban and rural areas whose\nattempts to improve their status and health are continually impeded by the need to divert time,\nenergy, and financial resources to acquire their daily water needs. The Project will generate\nemployment  through  local  labor,  thus  helping  to  create  a  stable  social  and  economic\nenvironment. It is expected that the Project will directly or indirectly benefit most of the country's\n800,000 population.\n6. The Project is designed to distribute its benefits in an equitable manner across East\nTimorese urban and rural communtities' needs, contributing to sustainable development and\noperation in the WS&S sector, and reducing poverty.\nC. Description of the Environment\n1. Physical Environment\n7. East Timor comprises the eastern half of Timor Island. It has a contiguous area of\n19,000 square kilometers (km2), with an additional 2,461 km2 in the Oecusse-Ambeno enclave\ninside  West  Timor.  Timor  is  the  largest  and  eastern  most  island  in  the  Lesser  Sunda\nArchipelago.\n8. The island is along the junction of the Australian and the Asian geological plates and is\nthus subject to frequent earthquakes. The  rock formations  are  primarily  sedimentary  karst\nuplifted by the collision of the two plates. As the formation is quite recent, the karst is highly\nfractured and crumbles easily. Metamorphic rock from past volcanic activity is limited to northern\nand central sections of the island. The high erosion rate from the crumbling karst layers has\nresulted in the formation of alluvial plains and isolated fertile valleys.\n9. The main geographic feature is the mountain range that runs east-west along the center\nof the island and that causes watercourses to flow either north to the Banda Sea or south to the\nTimor Sea.  Mountain peaks reach up to 3,000 meters in elevation so watercourses are steep,\nfast flowing, and because of the extended dry season, generally ephemeral. The river systems\nare short, cutting deep ravines into the unstable rock, forming deep canyons in the highlands,\nand abruptly widening as they reach the flat alluvial plains. Often the rivers narrow as they\napproach the sea because of obstruction by sandbars and intertidal deposits. Countless littoral\nterraces of coral origin, and some extensive plateaus, also of coral origin, characterize the north\nside of the island (e.g., Baucau and Laga). A few alluvial areas occur between Lautem and\nBaucau and in Manatuto district.  The main plains to the north occur at Batugade, Lois stream,\nDili, Manatuto, and Com. The south coast comprises a wide plain that extends from the border\neast to Viqueque where it begins to narrow, through to Lore in Lautem district. The enclave of\nOecusse-Ambeno is also very mountainous with a narrow coastal strip.  Here all streams flow to\nthe north.  The volcanic island of Atauro rises steeply from the sea to a maximum elevation of\n999 meters on Mount Mano Coco.", "79\nAppendix 8, page 3\n2. Climate and Water Resources\n10. Situated in the equatorial region, Timor has basically two annual seasons (wet and dry)\ninfluenced variously by the monsoon regime, proximity to the Australian continent, and locally by\nthe orographic effects of the mountainous topography.  The wet season, which lasts from\nNovember to May, results from the northern monsoon.  It is characterized by thunderstorms,\nhigh tropical rainfall and temperature, and concomitant humidity.  During the dry season from\nJune to October, winds from the south bring little rainfall and result in lower temperatures.\nAnnual rainfall ranges from some 500 to 1500 mm in the lower lying coastal areas to over 3000\nmm in the mountains.  Depending on location, average wet season rainfall ranges from 70\npercent (Kova-Lima) to 95 percent (Ambeno) of annual rainfall.  Those districts along the\nnorthern coastline (Ambeno, Liquica, Dili, Manatuto, and Baucau) have the lowest  rainfall,\nranging from about 500 mm in Manatuto to 800 mm in Ambeno and Baucau, with over 90\npercent generally falling in the wet season.\n11. The  hydrological  regime  is  primarily  dependent  on  the  climatic  conditions  of  the\nalternating wet and dry monsoon seasons. Rivers in the area are generally characterized by\ntheir relatively short length, steep gradient, short flood peaks, very high sediment load, and\nmobile beds.  In many areas, river and stream crossings require frequent realignment and repair\ndue to continual changes in river channels.  Sediment tends to be very coarse, including\nboulders and large gravel.  The mountainous topography and streamflow pattern makes the\nconstruction of dams and weirs problematic.\n12. Because of the relatively high rainfall and abundance of springs and surface water, and\nthe small population, there has not been the need in the past for significant groundwater\ninvestigation.  Therefore  knowledge  of  groundwater  occurrence  and  quality  is  limited.\nGroundwater is accessed in the mountain areas mainly through springs, which are commonly\ntapped at their source with water gravity fed to towns and villages, through small diameter\npipelines often many kilometers long.  Villagers along the coastal alluvial plains usually rely on\nopen, hand-dug, wells for their domestic supplies.  In addition a number of towns in East Timor\nobtain  at  least  part  of  their  raw  water  from  groundwater,  via  small  diameter  deep  bores\nequipped with downhole pumps.\n13. Typically, surface water, where available in the dry season, is of acceptable quality. In\nthe wet season, however, turbidity is normally unacceptably high with consequent implications\nfor water treatment. In general the quality of water from springs and groundwater sources is\nacceptable for most of the year, though often hard. In coastal areas communities can also have\nthe additional problem of saltwater intrusion into wells. The generally unfavorable geology and\nsteep topography in East Timor exacerbate the normal water resources difficulties faced during\nthe dry season as rivers dry up and spring flows recede, often to very small flows. All this\ncombines to produce a hydrological environment in which securing safe, and reliable, water\nsources for town and village supplies is difficult. Recurrent droughts exacerbate this problem.\n3. Biological Environment\n14. Timor is on the eastern side of the Wallace Line. The flora and fauna are similar to that\nof the tropical Australia-Pacific group. It has no large animals, but many small mammals, such\nas deer,  and  brightly  colored  birds.  Timor  was  one of  the  first islands settled by Europeans", "80\nAppendix 8, page 4\nbecause of its proximity to the Spice Islands.  A number of domesticated and feral animals have\nbeen introduced to the islands, such as horses, cattle, chicken, and pigs. During the last 10\nyears the deforestation was officially estimated at 70,000 hectares, with the unofficial estimate\ndouble this level. The central highlands are cultivated with coffee, mainly the robusta variety.\nEast Timor coffee commands a high price in the world market because of its higher-than-normal\nalkaline properties. Rice, corn, sorghum, beans, and root crops are grown in the lowlands.\nSlash and burn agriculture is common even on the steep hillsides.\n4. Sociocultural Environment\n15. Most of the population is concentrated in the northern coastal towns and in fertile valleys\nin the interior.  The coastal flat lands in the south are sparsely populated because of the harsh\nmountain terrain that divides the island.  Sea travel from the north to the south is constrained by\nstrong waves most of the year. The economy is based on agriculture, with coffee the major\nexport crop.  Surplus rice, corn, and other agricultural produce are consumed within the island.\nThere is little industry or manufacturing.  A number of potential mineral deposits have been\nidentified, but their commercial potential has not been explored. The service industry was,\nduring the Indonesian period, limited to the civil service and state-owned corporations, such as\ntelecommunications,  power  and  water,  and  oil  and  gas  distribution.  Trading  and  other\ncommercial  activities  were  limited  to  traditional  marketplaces  in  small  settlements.  Banks,\nrestaurants, hotels, and other businesses were mostly found in the two large centers: Dili and\nBaucau. Most formal businesses were burned down during the postconsultation destruction.\n16. Almost  70  percent  of  the  schools  were  destroyed  during  the  post-consultation\ndestruction.  Although  school  reconstruction  is  progressing,  at  present  many  classes  are\nconducted in open yards and damaged buildings. Tetum is the local language, with Bahasa\nIndonesia and Portuguese spoken by sizeable portions of the population. Almost 95 percent of\nthe population are Roman Catholics, with a small Muslim and Protestant population.\nD. Screening Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures\n1. Physical Environment\na. Project Activities\n17. Water Supplies. The Project will repair and rehabilitate existing town piped water supply\nsystems and domestic and community water supply schemes. Repair and rehabilitation of\nexisting pipelines, pumping and distribution systems, and community-managed supplies will\ncause localized and temporary disruptions through such things as road openings, excavations,\ndrilling, and associated traffic.  As these will be relatively small undertakings, working in areas of\nexisting  facilities  and  services,  they  are  not  expected  to  result  in  significant  or  lasting\nenvironmental impacts.\n18. Building Repairs. As part of its institutional development effort, a number of burned and\notherwise damaged water supply-related buildings (stores, workshops, generator rooms, etc.)\nwill be repaired.  Works  here  will  also  have  only a minor and temporary environmental impact\nthrough normal construction noise, associated traffic, and some small excavation. As these will\nbe relatively small undertakings, working in areas of existing buildings, they are not expected to\nresult in significant or lasting environmental impacts.", "81\nAppendix 8, page 5\n19. Sanitation.  There  are  no  communal  or  public  sewerage  systems  in  East  Timor.\nImproved latrines, where they occur, rely on septic tanks or soakage pits for effluent disposal. It\nis expected that the Project will be called upon to rehabilitate or repair some damaged disposal\nfacilities in the main towns. In these cases appropriate technology options will be utilized in all\ncommunity programs. The result will be that effluent disposal practices will be improved with a\npositive impact on local environmental health status. No significant environmental impacts are\nexpected from such rehabilitation.\n20. Drainage. In those towns and villages where water supplies are improved, there will\ninevitably be some increase in wastewater. This occurs through increased septic tank effluent,\nincreased household wastewater disposal, and general increased water usage by communities\nin their daily lives.  In areas where this increased wastewater load is indicated to be problematic,\nthe Project will rehabilitate selected, damaged, drainage works at appropriate locations. No\nsignificant environmental impacts are expected from rehabilitating these old drainage systems,\nrather  the  drainage  works  will  improve  the  environmental  situation  by  preventing  the\naccumulation of wastewater and consequent pollution and environmental health problems.\nb. Screening Parameters\ni.   Environmental Problems Due to Project Location\n21. Exact project activities will be determined by need. Activities will mostly be small works\ncomprising  the  repair  and  rehabilitation  of  existing  facilities  that  were  either  deliberately\ndamaged  in  the postconsultation period,  or are otherwise unserviceable.  Thus  the  project\nlocations,  which  are  likely  to  number  around  200  scattered  across  East  Timor,  will  be\ndetermined  by  circumstance.  The  Project  will  have  little  influence  as  to  their  locations.\nConsequently  the  Project  will  have  to  work  within  each  of  the  numerous,  different,\nenvironmental conditions that exist.  And at each site, if there are any environmental problems,\nthe Project will cope with them as conditions, good practice, and funding permit. However, it is\nexpected that as the works will merely be replacing or repairing existing WS&S facilities, in\nlocalized areas and over short periods, (up to a few days) environmental problems due to\nproject locations will be minor.\nii.   Environmental Problems Related to Design\n22. Similar comments apply as for para. 21. Designs for the repair and rehabilitation works\nwill have to generally accord with the preexisting arrangements and thus there is little latitude for\nthe Project to make significant changes to accommodate environmental problems that may be\nencountered.  However, as for  site  location,  if any  problems are encountered  that  can  be\naccommodated within the funding constraints, they will be dealt with using good environmental\npractices.\niii.   Environmental Problems Associated with Construction Stage\n23. The Project will only involve minor construction, and as such, transient environmental\ndisturbances  normally  experienced  during  construction  will  be  insignificant.  Typical\nenvironmental disturbances related to WS&S will include minor excavations to replace pipes\nand fittings and repair drains, temporary road and street closures to  allow  pipe  and  drain\nreplacement,  minor clearing  along  short  lengths   of  existing   pipeline routes to allow repairs", "82\nAppendix 8, page 6\nand rehabilitation, clearing of small areas (up to 20 meters square) for drill rig and truck access\nto bore sites, and minor short-term associated soil erosion if works are undertaken in high\nrainfall periods. Most of these disturbances will be on public land, and extend over only a day or\ntwo. They will have an areal impact generally limited to 10 to 100 square meters. As most works\nwill  involve  the  repair  or  replacement  of  existing  pipelines  and  other  WS&S  facilities,\nenvironmental effects will be no more, and probably less, than has already occurred. Other\nworks of significance include the proposed repair and rehabilitation of water supply-related\nstructures such as workshops, stores, generator rooms, storage tanks, and borehole housing.\nAll these works will be carried out on sites of existing (damaged) structures and no significant\nenvironmental effects are foreseen other than normal small building construction activities such\nas cartage of building materials and construction noise. Again any effects will be small and\ntemporary, possibly lasting from a few days to a few weeks.\niv.   Environmental Problems Resulting from Project Operations\n24. The only significant adverse operational impact is that of potential increase in local\ndischarge of wastewater because of improved water supplies. This will be ameliorated by\nrepairing  and  rehabilitating drainage  systems  in  problematic  areas.  Any  other  potential  or\nidentified  adverse effects  will  be preempted or  minimized  by  (i)  improving  water  resource\nmanagement and (ii) increasing promotion of environmental conservation through community\nparticipation and education activities. The issue of sustainability of system operation is being\naddressed through capacity-building and institutional development activities under the Project's\ncomponent 1 and through cooperation with WSA and donor partners active in the WS&S sector.\nv.   Potential Environmental Enhancement Measures\n25. The  Project\u2019s main contributions to environmentally sustainable development, as  it\nrelates to the sector, will be to undertake environmental monitoring under the guidance of the\nPMU.  Monitoring  will  include  (i)  measuring  the  effectiveness  of  any  environmental\nimprovements  needed,  (ii)  identifying  problems  that  may  arise  during  the  works,  and  if\nnecessary  (iii)  providing  ecological  audit  information  for  future  works  of  this  nature.  The\nproposed monitoring will be designed to quantify the benefits gained and any impacts sustained\nfrom  repairing  and  rehabilitating  town  and  community  WS&S  systems.  Environmental\nparameters to be monitored will be defined by the PMU, but will include raw water quality,\ntreated water quality, delivered water quality, need for and effectiveness of drainage systems,\nwater pressure in piped systems, environmental conditions in river  and  spring  catchments\nincluding pollution and land clearing, landslide and erosion problems affecting WS&S facilities,\nefficiency and effectiveness of sanitation facilities, and growth of algae in reservoirs. WSA will\nbe responsible for all water quality testing (chemical and bacteriological) using the water-testing\nlaboratory facility recently donated by the Government of Japan. They will also be responsible,\nin  cooperation  with  local  communities,  for  monitoring  construction  and  post-construction\nenvironmental aspects of the Project. The PMU will liaise with WSA and the Interim Health\nAuthority for the monitoring of environmental health statistics as part of the Project\u2019s focus on\nenvironmental  health  education  and  promotion  of  safe  domestic  hygiene  practices.  Under\nUNTAET, Indonesian environmental laws remain valid, although their implementation capacity\nwill need to be developed. UNTAET is presently reviewing environmental laws, regulations, and\nstandards,  and  these  may  be applied to the Project in the future, although it is expected that\nthis will not result in any adverse outcomes. Conversely, the PMU and WSA will compile project", "83\nAppendix 8, page 7\nenvironmental reports, the information from which will be passed on to the relevant section of\nUNTAET for consideration when developing their environmental standards and legislation.\n2. Biological Environment\n26. The water supply, building, sanitation, and drainage works proposed under the Project\nall pertain to repair and rehabilitation of existing facilities. None of the proposed activities are of\na scale large enough to have significant physical impact. As such, they are merely operating in\nareas that have already been disturbed by past works and therefore should have little or no\nimpact on the biological environment.\n3. Sociocultural Environment\n27. The water supply,  building,  sanitation,  and drainage  repair  and  rehabilitation  works\nproposed under the Project will be undertaken within existing roads and rights-of-way. No land\nacquisition or resettlement will be required. The Project is specifically designed to provide\npositive sociocultural impacts by improving WS&S, upgrading the quality of life for both urban\nand  rural  folk,  improving  environmental  health  standards,  generating  employment,  and\npromoting community participatory  processes for  development.  The  Project  is designed  to\ndistribute  its  benefits  in  an  equitable  manner  across  East  Timorese  urban  and  rural\ncommunities, contributing to sustainable development and operation in the WS&S sector, and\nreducing poverty. The overall sociocultural impact of the Project is assessed to be positive.\nE. Institutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Program\n28. Indonesian environmental laws and regulations remain in effect in East Timor. The\npersonnel implementing and enforcing the environmental laws and regulations were mostly\nIndonesian nationals and are not expected to return to East Timor. UNTAET needs support in\nreviewing these regulations and developing capacity to undertake environmental assessments.\nADB's technical assistance is proposed to assist in these areas.\n29. In addition to regular inspections of works to ensure that all possible mitigation measures\nare taken, environmental monitoring will be undertaken under the guidance of the PMU. The\nProject will (i) measure the effectiveness of environmental improvements, (ii) identify problems\nthat may arise during the  works,  and  if necessary,  (iii) provide ecological audit information for\nfuture works of this nature.  The proposed monitoring is designed to quantify the benefits gained\nand new impacts sustained from rehabilitating sanitation facilities and town and community\nwater supply systems.\nF. Conclusions\n30.  Due to the postconsultation destruction, environmental conditions in some urban areas\nof East Timor are quite poor. This situation may now be endangering populations through\npervasive waterborne diseases and lack of sanitation. Previously, WS&S activities were often\nundertaken without due regard  for  environmental procedures. The Project  will,  however,\nensure  that repairs and  rehabilitation of water supplies, buildings, and sanitation facilities are\nundertaken  with  care  for  the  environment. The  Project  will  ensure adequate environmental", "84\nAppendix 8, page 7\nprocedures and monitoring mechanisms are established. During the works and construction,\ncare will be taken to minimize disruption to the physical, biological, and social environment.\n31. Apart from the immediate beneficial impact of cleaning up, repairing, and rehabilitating\nWS&S infrastructure, the Project will encourage promotion of environmental health and hygiene\neducation,  ensuring  correct  health  procedures  and  water  conservation  measures  are\nundertaken.\n32. On the whole, the impact of the Project is expected to be positive and will be monitored\nthroughout implementation. This will be facilitated by institution building under the Project and\nthrough the PMU. Any potential negative environmental impacts are limited to construction\nactivities that are temporary and reversible.", "85\nAppendix 9, page 1\nINITIAL SOCIAL ASSESSMENT\nA. Benefits and Beneficiaries\n1.  In 1998, East Timor had an estimated population of under 0.9 million people, with over\n50 percent having been displaced during the postconsultation violence. It is estimated that\nupward of 85 percent have returned to their homes since the end of 1999. It is estimated that\n80-90 percent of the population live in rural areas, with the remainder living in the capital, Dili,\nand 12 main towns. These towns comprise formal urban dwellers, and an estimated 50 percent\nsquatters, urban infill, and peri-urban populations.\n2.  Even before the 1999 destruction and displacement, East Timor was one of the poorest\nareas in south-east Asia, with severe problems of adult literacy (41 percent), life expectancy (56\nyears), malnutrition, malaria, and tuberculosis. Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita was\nestimated  at  under  US$395,  and  approximately  50  percent  of  households  were  clustered\naround the poverty line. Following the popular consultation and subsequent destruction, this\nsituation has worsened dramatically, with GDP dropping an estimated 40 percent to US$230,\nand a generally recognized poverty population of almost 100 percent. Within the rural sector,\nthe destruction of their means of agricultural production, and the closure of banks, and loss of\nmeager savings resulted in East Timor being estimated as one of the absolute poorest countries\nin the world.\n3.  Under most Timorese traditional systems, the role of women was severely restricted,\nwith men dominating decision-making and leadership roles within the villages. These roles are\nchanging as a result of the social disruption caused by the long-term struggle for independence\nin East Timor, with women participating fully in all aspects of the clandestine front and in the\narmed resistance. Women are gaining new skills and responsibilities, and are beginning to\nmove into traditionally male-dominated income generation activities. It is imperative that this\nrespect and newly acquired roles are maintained within the new East Timorese society.\nB. Needs, Demands and Absorptive Capacity\n4.  Prior to the upheaval, less than half the population had access to  safe  water  and\nsanitation facilities. Sanitation practices, which were often unhygienic, were constrained by the\nabsence of  sufficient  water.  Dry  pit  latrines  are  used  extensively  and  were  often  located\nadjacent to water courses, or households. There were major health hazards caused by the lack\nof  sanitation  facilities  in  poorer  rural  and  urban  areas.  Poor  households  were  further\ndisadvantaged with poor access to basic health and education services.\n5.  With the substantial damage to infrastructure and public utilities that resulted following\nthe postconsultation violence, already degraded services ceased to function. Most communities\nnow have access to water through traditional means or through some emergency reconstruction\nworks. Although this may reduce substantially with the onset of the dry season, it is assumed\nthat the ongoing emergency programs, supplemented by urgent works within the proposed\nwater supply and sanitation (WS&S) program will suffice.\n6.  Within this environment, the immediate benefits of the water and sanitation program will\nbe to ensure that a comprehensive and equitable water supply and sanitation  program  is\nestablished that will eventually provide adequate supplies and services at an appropriate level\nof service for all people in East Timor.  It  is  important  to  implement  these programs within the", "86\nAppendix 9, page 2\nconstraints imposed by the community's commitments to other programs, restricted financial\nand institutional capacity, and other competing community and household objectives.\n7.  With almost the entire East Timor population suffering from the destruction, the need for\nreconstruction and rehabilitation of WS&S facilities is high, if disease is to be averted. In all\nareas, the rehabilitation and development of water supplies will free  labor  (both  men and\nwomen) for more productive uses. Improved sanitation facilities and practices, and the provision\nof clean water will have beneficial health effects, particularly for children and infants, and reduce\nthe costs associated with disease and morbidity.\nC. Adverse Effects on Vulnerable Groups\n8. The Project will not involve any land acquisition or resettlement. Project works will use\nthe existing rights-of-way. The Project will not have negative impacts on any vulnerable group.\nD. Social Dimensions in Project Design\n1. Community Participation\n9. The  remoteness  of  many  of  the  communities  and  the  difficulty  of  access  to  the\nsettlements made it almost impossible in the past for any effective services to be provided at the\ncommunity level. It was observed, and recounted from discussions, that there had been a lack\nof community participation in the process of developing appropriate water supply systems and\nsanitation facilities. In a number of villages, where infrastructure such as WS&S existed, the\nresidents did not  know  which agency  the facilities  came  from.  This  resulted  in  a  lack  of\nownership and  lack  of  motivation for  the  community  to  manage, operate,  or  maintain  the\nfacilities and systems. When technical problems arose, the community took no action, but rather\nreverted to the previous methods of attaining water or disposing of feces. This situation is now\nprevalent throughout the majority of communities visited during the mission.\n10. The communities have a very limited capacity to operate and maintain any facilities,\nprimarily due to lack of funds, but also due to poor training; technical assistance; and simple\nmanuals, tools, and repair equipment. The use of inappropriate technology in the past, made\nmany systems difficult to maintain due to the difficulty of obtaining spare parts and the shortage\nof qualified and experienced technical staff to undertake the repairs. Some systems were also\nvery expensive to operate and maintain due to the need for constant repair and replacement of\nparts that were of inferior quality or where poor workmanship and quality of design and/or\nconstruction had resulted in frequent breakages or failures. It is therefore especially important\nfor communities to be able to plan, manage, and implement their own development. In situations\nwhere communities can operate and maintain their own facilities, there is a considerably greater\nchance that the systems will be sustainable, than for those systems that rely on government\noperation and maintenance.\n11. The team acknowledges that the success of any development project involved in the\nWS&S sector is dependent upon the effective participatory involvement of the  community,\nespecially at the earliest stages of community project activities.  The use of a methodology such\nas the participatory rural appraisal (PRA) is effective in social preparation, problem solving,\nawareness raising, informing choice and facilitating participation of the community at all stages.\nAnother  important lesson is the value of  NGOs  in  facilitating  participatory development. Their", "87\nAppendix 9, page 3\ncloseness to the community assists in the process of participatory development and community\nmobilization,  which  creates  ownership  and  therefore  extends  sustainability.  Changes  in\nknowledge, attitudes, and practices relating to water use, hygiene and sanitation is essential for\nachieving  improvements  in  community health  and  well-being.  Community  participation  and\nsocial  preparation  are  critical  in  the  process  of  hygiene  and  sanitation  promotion.  The\ninstallation of facilities such as water supply systems and latrines, does not in itself necessarily\nguarantee improved health of the people. The focus must be extended to the proper utilization\nand management of WS&S.\n12. While the process of community participation within the WS&S sector is an ideal way to\nproceed, in East Timor the current situation is more complicated. There is already a community\nempowerment project1 under way, and a few other similar programs being considered.2 While\nthere is an issue that these programs\u2019 goals and objectives may conflict, when combined with\nthe wholesale, multisector reconstruction and development effort, the main result is instead an\ninordinate time and resource burden on recipient community members who are still struggling to\nrebuild their own personal lives. It is important that WS&S programs do not exceed this capacity\nthreshold.\n13. Therefore, all WS&S program components while still utilizing a community participation\nand ownership approach wherever possible, should take account of other community initiatives\nand a community\u2019s capacity to engage in such activities.\n2. Gender\n14. Under most Timorese traditional systems, the role of women was severely restricted,\nwith men dominating decision-making and leadership roles within the villages. These roles are\nchanging as a result of the social disruption caused by the long-term struggle for independence\nin East Timor, with women participating fully in all aspects of the clandestine front and in the\narmed resistance. Women are gaining new skills and responsibilities, and are beginning to\nmove into traditionally male-dominated income generation activities. It is imperative that this\nrespect and newly acquired roles are maintained within the new East Timorese society.\n15. Women play important roles in the household as major contributors to household income\nthrough marketing agricultural produce and petty trading activities. In addition they are the\nprimary caregivers and responsible for household work. Women report they have a say in\ndecisions about household spending and have access to savings for spending as needed.\n16. Although women reported fairly evenly divided responsibilities for water fetching, it was\ngenerally acknowledged that they bore the most burden and responsibility, especially as men\nwere often working elsewhere. Most rural women reported times in excess of 1 hour a day for\nwater carrying. Water was often not treated, due to a lack of knowledge, time, or resources.\nWomen are also burdened with responsibility for the health of family members and for caring for\nsick  family  members,  further  reducing  time  and  energy  for  both  productive  and  personal\nactivities.  It is therefore women who are in most need of assistance in reducing the time and\neffort required to obtain water supplies and in caring for the health and welfare  of family\nmembers.\n                                                       \n1  The Community Empowerment Program is a joint WB/ADB project that began in March 2000.\n2  For example, the United Nations Development Program Governance program.", "88\nAppendix 9, page 4\n17. Female survey respondents reported frequent skin and genital inflammations, indicative\nof poor water quality and sanitation practices. A lack of water for washing was a recurrent\ntheme. While the rehabilitation and development of water supplies and improved sanitation will\nnot change this situation substantially, especially in rural areas, nor empower women and\nchildren, it will allow women more time to pursue other opportunities, and provide a healthy\nenvironment for themselves and their families. It is expected that any WS&S program will work\nin conjunction with other initiatives in community development and empowerment.\n18. Improving hygiene and sanitation, and the utilization of WS&S facilities by improving\nknowledge, attitudes, and practices of the whole community, will positively impact on women.\nThe  health  of  the  family  will  improve,  and  the  load  borne  by  women  as  caretakers  will\ncorrespondingly reduce. Due to their traditional roles in the sector, women have a particular\nneed for improved access, management, and effective use of WS&S facilities.\n3. Sustainability\n19. At  this  early  stage  of  reconstruction  and  development,  it  is  difficult  to  say  how\nsustainable the nation of East Timor can be, let alone the sustainability of the WS&S sector.\nThere will certainly be a need for aid and support for many years to come, although the strength\nand perseverance of the East Timorese throughout and following the conflict are amazing and\nwill provide a sound foundation for their nation.\na. Community Ownership\n20. Within the WS&S sector, sustainability will be different between the urban and the rural\nsystems.  However,  a  common  element  to  achieve  sustainability  will  be  a  strong  level  of\nownership of project activities by the target groups, whether through community management in\nthe rural areas or cost recovery in the urban areas. It is recognized that issues of sustainability\ncan be addressed through adequate involvement of target groups and participants early on in\nproject activities.\nb. Health and Hygiene Awareness\n21. Another common element for sustainability is through health and hygiene awareness in\nwater use and sanitation. It is essential that the community gain an understanding of the link\nbetween  water  and  sanitation  and  health  conditions  of  the  community.  The  recognized\nimportance of domestic and personal hygiene, proper water use, and appropriate sanitation will\nencourage communities to change their habits.  These changes will ensure that developments\nimplemented within the Project, such as improved WS&S and water management groups will be\nsustained by the people. An understanding of their importance to the health of the community\nwill ensure this.\nc. Institutions\n22. While there will eventually be an East Timorese water authority (or similar) following the\nwithdrawal of UNTAET, it will be necessary for the current WSA to consider the sustainability of\nthe institutions within the sector. Issues for consideration include cost recovery, corporatization,\nand human resource capability. These issues will need to be considered early on in the WSA\nprogram, as their solutions (involving education, training, and institution building) take a long\ntime to realize.", "89\nAppendix 9, page 5\nd. Cost Recovery\n23. In the urban WS&S systems there will be the need, eventually, for full recovery of\noperation  and  maintenance  costs,  if  systems  are  to  be  sustained.  In  the  urban  areas,\nparticularly Dili, there will be a decided lack of community management in an everyday utility like\nwater and sanitation, that is, it is taken for granted. Given this, it is essential that recipients are\naware of the price implications of the substantial investments and operating costs involved.\nOther than sustaining the management and operations, tariffs also encourage users to utilize a\nresource more effectively, further increasing sustainability of the water resource itself.\ne. Willingness and Ability to Pay\n24. An essential component of cost recovery is the community\u2019s willingness and ability to\npay or participate in management. Without due regard for  these  two  issues, sustainability\nthrough cost recovery cannot be achieved. In the current climate, there is certainly a willingness\nby consumers to participate in the design and implementation process, and even pay (in the\ncase of urban supplies), however their capacity (or ability) to do so cannot match this desire. As\nthe economy progresses this situation will change (in varying degrees) and the WSA will need\nto monitor these changes to ensure the threshold is not broached.\nf. Appropriate Technology\n25. The importance of appropriate technology in sustainability was highlighted during the\nfield visit. The team encountered problems with operation and maintenance in some of the\nemergency  systems  implemented  by  the  United  Nations  and  NGOs.  By  incorporating\ntechnology that is manageable by the community, within their financial capabilities and technical\ncapacities, the extent to which the system will be sustainable will increase. Problems relating to\nthe lack of spare parts and the absence of repairs are also a key concern relating to the transfer\nof technology to rural communities. Provision must be included within the program to train\ncommunity members in the operation and maintenance of the facilities installed.  In deciding\nappropriate technology mechanisms, consideration must also be made as to how accessible are\nspare parts. In relation to operation and maintenance, encouragement of the community to\nestablish  financial  capabilities  to  sustain  ongoing  maintenance  and  repairs  must  also  be\nconsidered. Appropriate technology also means utilization of the most cost-effective technical\nsolutions.\n4. Urban and Rural\n26. Following the destruction, there has been a fear that rural groups will relocate to urban\nareas.  There  is  no  conclusive evidence  to  support  this at  this time.  Conversely,  with  the\ncessation of Indonesian rule (and their relocation policies), both urban and rural populations are\ngrappling with land title and occupation issues that impact upon their ability to recover from the\ncrisis. In some cases, it is reported that families are being asked by original landowners, to\nrelocate to their traditional homelands, or to seek opportunities in urban areas. Additionally,\ntown and district borders are being redrawn, families are still returning, and there are sporadic\nmilitia activities within border districts. Overall, there is a sense of change that is still impacting\npeople\u2019s decisions and practices, and will do so until some normality returns.\n27. It is important, therefore, that all programs are seen to be equitable between urban and\nrural areas. While urban works will eventually need to show cost recovery, this would be due to\nthe greater investment required. It is essential that this cost should not be borne, even indirectly,", "90\nAppendix 9, page 6\nby the rural population. Community water supplies may never be wholly economical, however\ntheir small investment costs, combined with linkage to other community development objectives\n(such as self management, empowerment, and community autonomy) may obviate the need for\nsuch criteria.   Additionally,   with  the  relocation  of  some  families  into  urban  areas,  and  the\ndevelopment of improved water and sanitation facilities in  all  communities, it  is  imperative that\nhouseholds' knowledge of appropriate water and hygienic practices is strengthened, averting\nwastage and misuse.\n5. Non-government Organizations\n28. There are over 150 international and local NGOs currently operating within East Timor.\nWith their greater finances and support, the international NGOs, while doing great work and\noften  working  closely  with  local  NGOs,  are  overshadowing  the  local  organizations.  It  was\nexpressed on many occasions by local groups, that they wanted to have more involvement and\nautonomy within the sector. Indeed, the team agreed that a more dynamic and larger group of\nlocal NGOs would be an asset for the sector, and that the WS&S program should facilitate their\nestablishment, coordination, development, and participation in the sector.\n29. It is important that both local and international NGOs be utilized by the program to\nensure that the level of impact and ownership within communities is sustained. It is envisaged\nthat a number of small local level NGOs will be encouraged to establish along subsector,\ndistrict, or gender lines. Under the Project, it will be necessary to provide considerable support\nto fostering the establishment and initial training and support for these NGOs for them to\nundertake these tasks. In addition it will be necessary to provide a coordinating NGO, an East\nTimorese-based organization, that will be responsible for overseeing the establishment and\ndevelopment of other organizations. It is envisaged that the sectoral NGO, Bia Hula, may play\nthis key role within the Project. The intention is to build local capacity of the East Timor NGOs to\nfacilitate the sustainability of community work within the country.\n6. Health\n30. Poor health conditions related to water supply, sanitation, and hygiene practices exist\nwidely throughout East Timor. While poor health in itself is a problem, high rates of morbidity\nadversely impact on poor communities. The increased burden of caring for sick family members,\nas  well  as  a  consequent  reduction  in  productive  activities,  exacerbates  the  already  poor\nsocioeconomic status of the community.\n7. Minority Groups\n31. East  Timor  has  no  identified  minority  groups.  Rural  communities  are  the  main\nbeneficiaries of the water and sanitation works, especially those in the border districts that\nsuffered, and continue to suffer the most interruption to normal activity.  Nevertheless,  the\nProject aims to ensure that there is equity across districts and between genders and urban and\nrural communities.\n8. Resettlement\n32. It is expected that the Project will not require any resettlement based on existing service\nlevels. Within urban communities, there may be some land tenure and land acquisition issues\nthat may require careful attention.", "91\nAppendix 9, page 7\n9. Stakeholder Participation\n33. The Project framework was developed using a rapid consultative approach, whereby as\nmany  representative  East  Timorese  and  other  stakeholders  and  decision  makers  were\nconsulted, and participated, in the formation  of  the  program  objectives  and  components.\nWhile the time frame did not allow for full participation, the team did manage to speak to many\nmen  and  women,  and  various  community  and  political  groups,  at  national,  district,  and\ncommunity levels. Communities and both formal and informal women\u2019s groups were consulted\nextensively throughout the field visits.\n34. It is essential that communities, local NGOs, and women\u2019s groups be involved in project\ndesign, implementation, and operation and maintenance  of  the  program  components.  It  is\nexpected  that  there  will  be  a  significant  community  focus  in  all  the  water  and  sanitation\nimplementation components, in addition to a separate overall public health and community\ndevelopment component.\n35. The  Project  emphasizes  the  encouragement  and  strengthening  of  local  water  and\nsanitation NGOs as the catalyst for more comprehensive and response community participation\ninitiatives.\nD. Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation\n36. The project management unit will supervise, monitor, and review the various contractors\nduring implementation. It is expected that all sector activities will be implemented through the\nunit,  which  will  in  turn  coordinate  its  activities  with  the  ongoing  program  of  emergency\nassistance from the United Nations.\n37. A comprehensive benefit monitoring and evaluation (BME) program will be developed\nduring the implementation of component 1, and in conjunction with data generated through\nother existing ADB and other International Funding Agency projects. The BME will be employed\nalong  with  the  conventional  project  performance  monitoring  systems  approach.  A  set  of\npredetermined criteria and indicators will be identified, based on the key information needs of\nthe WSA in UNTAET and ADB. BME will be used to assess the progress and implementation of\nthe use of funds and delivery of public works and infrastructure activities, and measure the\nimpacts  resulting from project  implementation  strategies.  BME  is  important  to  identify  and\naddress priority needs of the intended beneficiaries, and ensure that indicators more accurately\nreflect local experiences.\n38. Key areas for BME will include (i) technical and physical aspects, (ii) socioeconomic\ndevelopment, and (iii) human and institutional development. Impacts will be measured in terms\nof increased community participation, public accountability, transparency, better provision and\ncoverage of basic services (especially for women and the poor), and opportunities and direct\nemployment generation.\n39. It is expected that the BME will be transferred to the new WSA following the exit of\nUNTAET, and that the process and outputs will form the basis of a more sustainable and\nstrategic East Timor WSA."], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20000810174850Z", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 3.01 for Windows", "Creator": "PSCRIPT.DRV Version 4.0", "Title": "Microsoft Word - R156-00Grant.doc", "ModDate": "D:20040402081506+08'00'"}}
