THE ENSUING PROGRAM \n \n1.  The proposed Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Health Systems Strengthening Program will support \nthe Revamping Secondary Health Care program of the Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa \n(GOKP) of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province, Islamic Republic of Pakistan. The program will \nassist in achieving the goal of the Department of Health (DOH) of GOKP in strengthening the \nhealth system and providing quality health care services that are accessible, efficient, and \nequitable, especially for the poor and vulnerable.1 The program will support the health sector by \n(i) strengthening and streamlining the human resources for health management, (ii) strengthening \nthe DOH\u2019s capacity to deliver health services, (iii) improving governance and financing quality, \n(iv) transforming secondary care facilities, and (v) ensuring availability of quality medicines. \n \n2.  The  Khyber  Pakhtunkhwa  is  the  smallest  province  geographically  with  35  million \ninhabitants in 2017 according to preliminary census estimates, including the population of 5 million \nof the former Federally Administered Tribal Areas. GOKP\u2019s budget for FY2021 is PRs923 billion, \nwhile the DOH\u2019s budget is PRs124 billion, which amounts to 13.4% of the total budget and shows \nthe commitment to improving the health sector. \n \n3.  Health care was devolved to the provinces in 2010 under the 18th Amendment of the \nConstitution. Progress in improving health indicators has been relatively slow in Pakistan, and  \nKhyber Pakhtunkhwa has consistently performed below the national average for Pakistan. There \nis significant bypassing of primary and secondary care, with tertiary hospitals carrying the bulk of \nthe load. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n4.  Under the Revamping Secondary Health Care, quality of services will be ensured by \nimplementing  the  Minimum  Health  Services  Delivery  Package  for  Secondary  Care  Khyber \nPakhtunkhwa.2 A results-based lending (RBL) program lends itself to investing in measurable \nimprovements in quality of care,3 such as, the establishment of multidisciplinary hospital quality \ncommittees to candidly discuss patient treatment events, learn from errors and discern possible \nfuture improvements, and the introduction and implementation of clinical pathways. Through a \nwell-defined  disbursement-linked  indicators  (DLIs),  the  RBL  will  create  incentives  and \naccountability for results. One such DLI is a reduction of surgical site infections, a leading cause \nof complications and death in patients who have had operations, which is considered a good \nindicator of in-hospital quality of surgery and after-care.4 Implemented and institutionalized, the \naforementioned  quality  gains  coupled  with  preventive  and  corrective  maintenance  plans, \nenhanced human resources for health (HRH) management, and forecasting of health demand \nand supply, will make the quality of care sustainable, leading to a lasting impact of the program. \n \n \n \n1  Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Department of Health. 2018. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Health Policy (2018-2025). \nPeshawar. \n2 GOKP, DOH. 2019. Minimum Health Services Delivery Package for Secondary Care Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. \nPeshawar.  \n3 Next to quality medical equipment and infrastructure and availability of medicines, quality of care also concerns \nmedical and supporting staff that all collaborate in an organized, conducive, accountable, evidence-based, and \noptimal manner. \n4 As opposed to, for example, maternal deaths, which may be due outside factors, such as late referral.  \n \n ", "2 \n \n5.  The transaction technical assistance (TRTA) will help GOKP to (i) review the technical, \neconomic, and financial viability of the program and ascertain the program rationale, scope, cost, \nschedule, implementation arrangements, risks and mitigation measures; (ii) ensure compliance \nwith ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and identify mitigation measures and institutional \nstrengthening  actions;  and  (iii)  assist  the  program  executing  and  implementing  agencies \nundertake advance actions for the ensuing program. \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n6.  Output 1: RBL program preparation and program due diligence undertaken. This will \ninclude assisting in the preparation of all documents required for program processing, including \nlinked documents, program implementation document, and program implementation startup \nsupport. \n \n7.  Output  2:  Quality  of  care  measurement  indicators  established  for  monitoring  and \nreporting. Developing and fine-tuning of the DLIs, including proposed disbursements in amounts \nor  percentages  of  the  loan  amount.  Developed  and  government  agreed  proposal  for  an \nindependent third-party verification agent to verify the achievement of DLIs before disbursing by \nADB.  \n \n8.  Output 3: Framework for Clinical Pathways Developed. Development of a framework for \nclinical standards and protocols remains a major objective of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa\u2019s health \nstrategy to streamline the health sector development and quality review. The program will help \nGOKP meet this objective by designing a framework to develop standard gender-sensitive \nprotocols and pathways for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures elaborated for the top 10 \ncauses of morbidity and mortality at SHC hospitals. Review HRH imbalances and requirements \nrelated to strengthening of SHC. Develop an HRH plan and design the development of a medium \nto long-term health needs planning tool to be institutionalized at DOH. Review the pharmaceutical \nsupply chain at SHC hospitals, and assess the refurbishment plans for the pharmacies, according \nto  international  best  practices.  Design  a  short-to-medium-term medicine  and  supply  needs \nplanning tool institutionalized at DOH.   \n \n9.  Output  4:  Analysis  in  changes  in  health  outcomes  and  quality  of  care  due  to \nimprovements in SHC triggered by the program.     \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n10.  The TRTA is estimated to cost $0.50 million which will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-7). The key expenditure items are listed in \nAppendix 1. The government will provide counterpart support in the form of office accommodation \nfor the program implementation unit and consultants, venue meetings, access to data, exemptions \non taxes and duties and other in-kind contributions.
