The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been helping to improve water supply and \nsanitation (WatSan) services in Timor-Leste since early in the emergency period following the \n1999 independence referendum. ADB administered the first and second Water Supply and \nSanitation Rehabilitation Projects1 between August 2000 and April 2003. The projects restored \nand expanded rural and urban water supplies and strengthened the Water and Sanitation \nService (WSS), which manages the Government of Timor-Leste\u2019s WatSan investments and \nservices.   \n \n2.  ADB\u2019s  Country  Program  and  Strategy  Update  (CSPU)  2005\u221220062  includes  the \nfollowing  strategic  focus:  \u201cRehabilitate  key  infrastructure  including  \u2026  water  supply  and \nsanitation.\u201d In 2004, Timor-Leste became eligible for Asian Development Fund (ADF) grants, \nand  ADB  and  the  Government  agreed  during  a  country  program  confirmation  mission  in \nDecember 2004 to program a project preparatory technical assistance (TA)3 grant in 2005 to \nhelp the Government prepare an urban WatSan project to be partly funded by an ADF grant. \nThe TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The Millennium Development Goal (MDG) target for water supply in Timor-Leste is to \nincrease from 44% to 78% the proportion of people with improved sources of water. The target \nfor sanitation is to increase from 19% to 46% the proportion of people with improved sanitation. \nAccess to piped water is even lower: only about 13% of families have house connections and \n16% are served by community taps.4 Most East Timorese live in rural areas where access to \nimproved  water  sources  and  sanitation  is  worst.  So  success  in  rural  areas  is  the  key  to \nachieving MDG Goal 7 targets. Accordingly, significant bilateral external assistance goes toward \nimproving rural WatSan. The largest bilateral funding source in the subsector, the Australian \nAgency for International Development (AusAID), is expected to commit to a second phase of its \nCommunity Water Supply and Sanitation Program. Others, such as the Government of Portugal \nand the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund are expected to continue to support rural WatSan. \n \n4.  Meanwhile,  Timor-Leste\u2019s  urban  centers,  particularly  the  capital,  Dili,  are  growing \nrapidly.5 Global experience shows that urbanization is both inevitable and key to economic \ngrowth and sustainable poverty reduction. Since 2003, only the Government of Japan and the \nJapan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) have financed major water supply investments \nin Dili; the Government of Portugal through Aguas de Portugal Timor-Leste (Portugal Water \nTimor-Leste),  and  the  German  Technical  Cooperation  upgraded  components  of  the  water \nsupply system in the second city, Baucau. JICA\u2019s program in Dili is continuing and, by 2007, all \nthe city\u2019s smaller water treatment plants will have been upgraded in addition to the new Dili \ncentral water treatment plant with a capacity of 6,000 cubic meters per day. Distribution will \nhave been upgraded in all of Dili\u2019s 10 water supply zones.  \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2000.

Timor-Leste Human Development Report: Paths Out of Poverty, \nDraft A. Dili. \n5  Initial results from the 2004 national census show that Dili district\u2019s population increased by 39% since 2001 and \nnow has 19% of the total population.  \n ", "2   \n5.  But despite these investments in water production and distribution capacity, most Dili \nresidents  receive  poor  water  supply  service  and  WSS  earns  little  income  (Appendix  2). \nCommunity respondents in the City Alliance-funded Dili Slum Upgrading Project consistently \nplace improved water supply as their highest development priority. WSS estimates that only 30\u2212 \n35% of Dili families and businesses receive reliable piped water supplies to their house or \npremises. Nowhere in Dili is there a continuous 24-hour service. Why is the level of service poor \ndespite the investments in water production and distribution?  \n \n6.  The answer is that the vertical structure of the Dili water supply system is not complete. \nAdequate clean water reaches many neighborhoods, but it does not reach households and \nbusinesses within those neighborhoods. Where does the water go\u2014how much is consumed, for \nwhat purpose, and why do some get water and others do not? Poor quality reticulation (tertiary \ndistribution) and lack of demand management are the crux of the problem: (i) reticulation \nnetworks  do  not  penetrate  into  many  neighborhoods,  (ii)  some  reticulation  networks  leak \nexcessively, (iii) much water is pilfered from reticulation pipes, and (iv) water is wasted. Table 1 \nshows the estimated water balance for the Dili water supply system. The system incurs large \nwater losses. \n \nTable 1: Water Balance for Dili \n    Billed  Billed Metered Consumption (including water  Revenue \n  Authorized  Authorized  exported)  Water \n  Consumption  Consumption  19%  19% \n  59%  19%  Billed Nonmetered Consumption   0% \n    Unbilled  Unbilled Metered Consumption   8%   \nSystem  Authorized  Unbilled Nonmetered Consumption   32%   \nInput  Consumption   \nVolume  40%  Non-\n100%    Apparent  Unauthorized Consumption   Not Known  revenue \n  Losses  Metering Inaccuracies    Not Known  Water \nWater Losses Not Known  81% \n41%    Leakage on Transmission and /or Distribution \n  Mains     Not Known \nReal Losses  Leakage and Overflows at Storage Tanks \nNot Known  Not Known \nLeakage  on  Service  Connections  up  to  the \nCustomers\u2019 Meters      Not Known \nSource: Water and Supply Service estimates. \n \n7.  With large water losses and high unbilled authorized consumption, WSS\u2019s nonrevenue \nwater is very high, at approximately 81%. WSS earns minimal revenue from water sales and it \nrelies on government subsidies to finance its operations. The Dili water supply emergency repair \nand improvement budget is a handout from the Government that can be anywhere from $10,000 \nto $30,000 per annum, totally inadequate to upgrade reticulation and service connections. Only \n1 of 10 service zones in Dili has a good reticulation system. Reticulation in all other zones \ncomprises mostly Portuguese or Indonesian era galvanized iron pipes, corroded and prone to \nleakages, and with almost no monitoring and management of service connections.   \n \n8.  To achieve the National Development Plan (NDP) target of \u201c80% of urban population \nwith access to safe piped water\u201d (NDP p. 280), there is a strong rationale for focusing ADB \nurban WatSan support entirely on Dili\u2019s reticulation system and service connections, together \nwith capacity development support for WSS. So long as WSS is unable to deliver a reliable \npiped water supply service to its Dili market, WSS will fail financially and technically, it will be \nunable to support WatSan services in district centers, returns on capital investments will remain \nlow, and the Government will have no means of meeting its NDP urban WatSan targets. This ", "  3\nweakness  will  also  impact  NDP  rural  WatSan  targets  because  WSS  is  responsible  for \nsupporting small town (subdistrict) WatSan.    \n \n9.  The rationale (para. 8) hinges on WSS developing as an efficient, independent, and \nfinancially self-sufficient supplier of WatSan services. Is this achievable? Recent experience \nwith other urban monopolies in Timor-Leste suggests that it is; and it is the expressed policy of \nthe Government to create WSS into an independent public corporation. The Government\u2019s \ntelecommunications operation has been privatized using a build-operate-transfer model, so that \nTimor Telecom is today a successful, independent service provider. The Government has more \nthan halved its annual subsidy to its electricity operator, Electricidade de Timor-Leste (EDTL), \nunder  a  management  contract  arrangement  and  an  aggressive  program  to  install  prepaid \nmeters. Both the Port of Dili and Dili Airport operate as public corporations and are close to \nbeing financially self-sufficient. The institutional fundamentals for the corporatization of WSS are \nbeing put in place. The decree law allowing WSS to charge for WatSan services was passed in \n2004, and the tariff policy and tariff schedule have been approved by the responsible minister. A \ndraft decree law for creating WSS into a public corporation was presented to the Council of \nMinisters in September 2004, but the Government wisely determined it too soon to reconstitute \nWSS.  \n \n10.  On the demand side, there is clear evidence of strong willingness to pay for piped water \nsupplies to the house, even in low-income neighborhoods in Dili. Community consultations by \nthe Dili Slum Upgrading Project are encountering a high real demand for improved water \nsupplies. And the success of EDTL\u2019s prepaid meter program is relevant to affordability and \nwillingness-to-pay considerations for water supply. The success was largely due to the effective \npartnership between EDTL and the Dili district administration, the latter having a comparative \nadvantage in working alongside communities. The Dili district administrator is of the view that a \nsimilar partnership with WSS could ensure the success of a water supply connection and \nmetering program throughout Dili.    \n  \n11.  Wastewater  management  in  Dili  is  poor,  and  urban  environmental  sanitation  (also \ncovering  drainage,  solid  waste  management,  pavements,  and  the  like)  is  substandard, \nparticularly  in  low-income  areas.  International  experience  is  clear  that  community-based \nsanitation improvement programs using simple technology are most effective, affordable, and \nsustainable in low-income cities like Dili. There is scope for an ADB-supported intervention to \nwork with other partners to improve wastewater management as water supplies improve in \nproject neighborhoods. Prospective partners include Dili District, Dili Urban Upgrading Project, \nUnited  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP),  and  other  United  Nations  agencies, \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  and  bilateral  aid  agencies.  Partnerships  would  also \ncover hygiene improvement.  \n \n12.  Improving WatSan in Dili is consistent with both goals of ADB\u2019s Pacific Strategy:6 (i) \ngood WatSan services improve people\u2019s productivity and economic competitiveness, and (ii) \nclean water and sanitation are key social services for the poor (Pacific Strategy, p. 19). Timor-\nLeste\u2019s NDP sets even higher targets for access to clean water and sanitation than the MDGs. \nADB\u2019s new results-based CSPU 2006\u22122008,7 which supports the NDP, includes \u201cimproved \nwater supply and sanitation for residents and businesses in urban areas\u201d as program outcome \nand  sets  the  following  outcome  indicators  for  2006\u22122008:  (i)  40%  of  Dili  residents  and \nbusinesses connected to 24-hour piped water; and (ii) 20% of Dili neighborhoods with effective \nand  sustainable  wastewater  collection,  treatment,  and  disposal.  Finally,  the  Government\u2019s \n                                                 \n6 ADB. 2004. A Pacific Strategy for the Asian Development Bank 2005\u22122009. Manila. \n7 ADB. 2005.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The  expected  impact  of  the  project  preparatory  TA  is  improved  water  supply  and \nsanitation for households and businesses in Dili. The expected outcome is the agreed-upon \ndesign of the Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Project to be funded in part by an ADF grant. \nThe  project  will  have  the  following  components:  (i)  Dili  water  supply  reticulation  (tertiary \ndistribution and metered service connections), and (ii) neighborhood sanitation and hygiene. \nThe TA will also prepare an associated TA project to develop WSS. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The TA consultants will work closely with WSS, Dili district administration, communities, \ndevelopment partners, and NGOs. The TA will conduct a Dili City water supply audit, following \nthe model terms of reference (TOR) prepared by the ADB water team in 2004. Findings will \ndetail  and  confirm  Dili\u2019s  water  balance  (Table  1),  identify  water  supply-related  financial \ntransactions,  and  describe  water  sources  and  consumption  patterns  for  families  and \nbusinesses.  This  understanding  is  key  to  proposals  for  effective  policies,  procedures,  and \ninvestments  to  improve  city  water  supplies,  especially  for  the  poor.  The  extra  baseline \ninformation is also necessary to measure project impact. Likewise for sanitation, hygiene, and \nwater-related health status, existing and new baseline information is needed to design effective, \naffordable, and sustainable responses to Dili\u2019s poor sanitation situation, and to measure project \nimpact. The TA consultants will apply best practice, including the methodology for participatory \nassessments  (MPA)  and  participatory  hygiene  and  sanitation  transformation  (PHAST). \nAssessment of WSS will introduce simple performance benchmarking needed to design and \nmeasure the success of a program for strengthening any water supply utility. WSS customers \nwill participate. TA resources will then help prepare a comprehensive feasibility study covering \ntechnical,  institutional,  social,  financial,  economic,  and  environmental  aspects.  Subproject \nappraisal  reports  (SPARs)  will  be  prepared  for  each  project  site;  or,  in  situations  where \nnumerous small sites would be improved using similar technology and approach, a summary \nfeasibility analysis would be prepared for each site. In addition to physical investments, each \nSPAR  will  fully  consider  investments  in  improving  hygiene  attitudes  and  behavior.  The \nGovernment plans to eventually reconstitute WSS as a public corporation. This is a sound \npolicy, but cannot be implemented until WSS is a stronger performing organization. The WSS \nassessment and performance benchmarking program will guide the preparation of the TA for \ndevelopment of the WSS organization.     \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $720,000 equivalent comprising $510,000 in \nforeign exchange and $210,000 equivalent in local currency. The Government has requested \nADB to finance $600,000 covering the entire foreign exchange cost and $90,000 equivalent of \nthe local currency cost. The TA will be financed by ADB on a grant basis from the Japan Special \nFund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government will contribute $120,000 equivalent \nto  finance  part  of  the  local  currency  cost  through  the  provision  of  office  accommodation, \n                                                 \n8 Government of Timor-Leste. 2005.

The detailed cost estimates and \nthe financing plan are in Appendix 3. The Government has been informed that approval of the \nTA does not commit ADB to financing the ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The Ministry of Natural Resources, Minerals, and Energy Policy will be the Executing \nAgency for the TA, and will give day-to-day implementation counterpart support through WSS. \nThe WSS director will be the Government\u2019s TA project director, and the WSS chief of Urban \nWater Supply will be the day-to-day counterpart of the TA consultant team leader.  \n \n17.  ADB will select and engage a team of international (20 person-months) and domestic \n(40  person-months  plus  15  person-months  of  field  survey  enumerators)  consultants  in \naccordance with the ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements \nsatisfactory  to  ADB  for  selecting  and  engaging  domestic  consultants.  The  international \nconsulting firm will be recruited using ADB\u2019s quality-based system (QBS). QBS is justified \nbecause  the  quality  of  the  consultants  and  proposed  approach  are  critical  to producing  a \nfeasible  and  efficient  project  design  in  the  challenging  area  of  low-income  neighborhood \nWatSan. The simplified technical proposal format will be used to invite and evaluate proposals \nfrom the international consulting firms. The international WatSan specialist and engineer will be \nthe team leader. Other international consultants will have expertise in civil engineering, urban \nenvironmental  sanitation,  community  development,  organization  development,  financial \nanalysis,  and  economics  and  poverty  impact  assessment.  Domestic  consultants  will  have \nexpertise  in  WatSan  and  engineering,  and  community  development.  Five  domestic  field \nenumerators (15 person-months) will work with communities on baseline status, preferences, \nwillingness to pay, and other aspects. Appendix 4 gives the TOR for consultants. The TA will \nfinance the rental of five computers for enumerators and one photocopier, and the purchase of \nproject office and field equipment including printer, scanner, and survey equipment. Equipment \nfor  the  TA  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement  and \nprocedures acceptable to ADB and will be retained by the Executing Agency after the TA. \n \n18.  The TA is expected to begin in February 2006, to be implemented over 6 months, and \nbe completed in July 2006. The consultants will produce (i) an inception report by the end of 1 \nmonth, (ii) an interim report by the end of 3 months, (iii) a draft final report and draft report and \nrecommendation of the President with appendixes and supplementary appendixes by the end of \n5 months, and (iv) the final report by the end of 6 months. \n \nIV.

Informal \nsettlements typically have no piped water service at all. Residents rely on unsafe shallow wells and make do with \nsmall water volumes. Poor residents are consequently more susceptible to water-related diseases, particularly \ndiarrhea among children. Inadequate supply of water reduces the productivity of poor families and increases their \nhealth costs. Bad sanitation in poor urban neighborhoods in Timor-Leste increases the prevalence of vector-borne \ndiseases such as dengue fever and malaria.

Scope of Consulting Services \n1.  Team Leader and Members \n1.  The international water supply and sanitation (WatSan) specialist/senior engineer (6 \nperson-months) will be the team leader (TL). The TL will (i) hold a degree in civil engineering, (ii) \nhave  experience  as  a  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA)  TL  and  substantial \nexperience working on urban WatSan projects in developing member countries in the Asia and \nPacific region, including working with urban communities. The ability to communicate in Bahasa \nIndonesia and/or Tetum will be a strong advantage. The consultant will be engaged on a \ncontinuous basis for the duration of the TA. The consultant will confer regularly with the director \nof the Water and Sanitation Service (WSS), the Dili district administrator, and other senior \nofficials and representatives; and will work on a day-to-day basis with the WSS chief of Urban \nWater Supply. As TL, the consultant will perform the following tasks: \n(i)  Coordinate team activities and ensure efficient implementation of tasks.  \n(ii)  Coordinate with and brief government counterparts, and ensure that consultant \nteam members coordinate appropriately with their relevant counterparts. \n(iii)  Regularly brief and confer with the TA project officer. \n(iv)  Take  overall  responsibility  for  timely  preparation  and  submission  of  required \nreports, and ensure their quality and completeness. \n \n2.  The following additional international consultants will be engaged (person-months and \nguidelines  are  in  parenthesis):  (i)  WatSan  junior  engineer  (4,  continuous);  (ii)  urban \nenvironmental sanitation specialist (3, intermittent); (iii) community development specialist (2, \nintermittent); (iv) organization development specialist (2, continuous); (v) financial analyst (1, \ncontinuous); and (vi) economist and poverty reduction analyst (2, intermittent). The following \ndomestic consultants will be engaged: (i) WatSan specialist/deputy TL (5, continuous); (ii) two \nWatSan engineers (5 each, continuous); (iii) two engineering surveyors (5 each, continuous); \nand (iv) three community development specialists (5 each, continuous). Local nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs) or other local institutions will provide field survey enumerators (about 15 \nperson-months) for beneficiary and community consultations.  \n \n2.  Core Team for Water Supply  \n \n3.  The core team for water supply will be led by the international WatSan specialist/senior \nengineer. The team will design and prepare the project component for improving water supply \nreticulation and service connections in Dili. The TL will provide technical direction and guidance \nto team members and will help prepare and finalize (i) all WatSan technical options to be tested \nand assessed; (ii) project technical guidelines and unit costs; (iii) technical WatSan aspects of \nfeasibility studies; (iv) project cost estimates, financing, and project documents; and (v) the draft \nTA report on the WSS organization development project. The core team for water supply will do \nthe following:   \n(i)  Dili city water supply audit. Design and implement a comprehensive city water \nsupply  audit,1  which  will  identify  flows  of  water,  flows  of  money,  and  water \n                                                 \n1 The design of the Dili city water audit will be guided by ADB\u2019s model terms of reference for Diagnostic City Water \nAssessments available on www.adb.org/water. \n ", "12  Appendix 4 \nconsumption characteristics in Dili. Field surveys and investigations must be \nsufficient to yield statistically reliable data on  characteristics and parameters \nexamined. \n(ii)  Water balance for Dili. Use the results of the city water supply audit to update \nand supplement WSS\u2019s estimated water balance for Dili.  \n(iii)  Diagnostic  analysis.  Use  the  water  supply  audit  and  the  water  balance  to \nprepare a diagnostic analysis of the poor water supply service in Dili. \n(iv)  Water supply improvement scope. Use the results of the diagnostic study to \nconfirm the scope of the water supply improvement component in terms of (a) Dili \nsystem  components  and  zones;  (b)  characteristics  of  target  neighborhoods, \nhouseholds, and businesses; and (c) coverage.    \n(v)  Options analysis. Within the agreed-upon scope, enunciate and analyze options \nrelating to (a) technology and engineering; (b) institutional arrangements, and \nroles and responsibilities, including community-based and community-supported \napproaches, role of NGOs and so on; (c) operation and maintenance (O&M) \narrangements; and (d) others. Consider innovative approaches such as using \nsmall-scale private piped water networks, differential tariffs based on quality of \nservice (see www.adb.org/water), and so on.   \n(vi)  Agreed-upon  approaches.  Consult  on  the  enunciated  options  with  major \nstakeholders, including WSS, Dili district, communities, families, businesses, and \nsmall-scale  water  providers.  The  community  development  specialist,  and \npreferably the core TL also, should be experts and experienced in implementing \nthe methodology for participatory assessments (MPA) approach, which should be \napplied (as modified for local conditions) in project planning and design with \nparticipating neighborhoods. Finalize agreed-upon/preferred options. Options will \ndescribe the approach the project will take to improve water supplies for families \nand businesses in different characterized situations.  \n(vii)  Identified beneficiaries. Agree with stakeholders on what neighborhoods and \nbusiness concentrations will participate in the project. To the extent possible, \nparticipants/beneficiaries  should  self-select  based  on  their  \u201cdemand\u201d2  for  the \nproject.  \n(viii)  Feasibility studies. Prepare feasibility studies for all water supply infrastructure \nand facilities to be funded by the project. The studies will be site specific and be \nof  a  quality  normally  required  for  subproject  appraisal  reports  (SPARs).  In \nsituations  where  numerous  smaller  sites  would  be  improved  using  similar \ntechnology and approach, individual SPARs for all sites would not be required \nand a summary feasibility analysis may be applied. SPARS will cover technical, \ninstitutional, social, financial, economic, and environmental aspects and will be \nsuitable as supplementary appendixes to the report and recommendation of the \nPresident (RRP). \n(ix)  Cost estimates, financing, and project documents. Prepare cost estimates \nand financing plan for all the project\u2019s water supply infrastructure and facilities \ninputs in a form compatible with class of service table (COSTAB)-based analysis \nand aggregation. Prepare a detailed component description, core appendixes, \nand supplementary appendixes appropriate for the draft RRP. \n                                                 \n2  Demand-based approaches to sustainably improving water supplies are found in the 1992 Dublin Principles. The \nbest proxy for \u201cdemand\u201d is willingness to pay, and payment can be in whatever form that is of value to participants, \nincluding money, land, labor, supplies, and assistance with planning and managing. Global experience shows that \nusing an administrative process to select beneficiaries, typically based on \u201cneed\u201d, leads to less sustainable \nbenefits.  \n ", "  Appendix 4  13 \n(x)  WSS  performance  benchmarking.  Work  with  the  organization  development \nspecialist to help prepare a performance benchmarking system for WSS. This \ntask  will  require  a  thorough  assessment  of  WSS\u2019s  strengths,  weaknesses, \nopportunities,  and  threats.  Benchmarking  should  be  simple  and  focus  on \nprobably just 10 core indicators. WSS officers should \u201cown\u201d the process. WSS \nshould  become  a  member  of  the  World  Bank-sponsored  International \nBenchmarking  Network  (IBNET)  program.  The  IBNET  start-up  kit  might  be \nappropriate for WSS. \n(xi)  WSS  development  TA.  Design  a  TA  project  for  developing  WSS  into  an \nefficient,  independent,  and  financially  viable  WatSan  utility  that  could  be \nreconstituted as a public corporation. Prepare a draft TA paper and consultant \nterms of reference (TOR) suitable for consideration by Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) Management. \n \n3.  Core Team for Sanitation and Hygiene \n \n4.  The  core  team  for  sanitation  and  hygiene  will  be  led  by  the  international  urban \nenvironmental sanitation specialist.  The team will design and prepare the project component for \nimproving sanitation conditions and hygiene practices in neighborhoods that receive improved \nwater supplies through the project. The TL will provide technical direction and guidance to team \nmembers and will help prepare and finalize work and deliverables (para. 3 for water supply core \nTL). The team will do the following: \n \n(i)  Existing  conditions.  Compile  from  secondary  sources  a  general  picture  of \nsanitation and hygiene conditions and characteristic situations in Dili. Important \nsources include project documents, particularly the ongoing Dili Urban Upgrading \nProject funded by the Cities Alliance.     \n(ii)  Input criteria for selecting water supply beneficiary neighborhoods. Use the \nknowledge  from  (i)  to  prepare  sanitation  and  hygiene  criteria  that  will  be \nconsidered in screening and selecting neighborhoods to participate in the water \nsupply component. For instance, neighborhood types that would have difficulty \nhandling additional wastewater may be less appropriate than neighborhoods that \ncould handle extra flows and/or neighborhoods with high potential to improve \nliving conditions and health status by improving sanitation and water supplies.   \n(iii)  Baseline  surveys  and  analysis.  Conduct  detailed  sanitation  and  hygiene \nbaseline surveys in neighborhoods selected for water supply improvement. The \nsurvey  and  analysis  should  cover  physical  aspects,  attitudes  and  practices, \nhealth status, and other relevant factors. The information is necessary for options \nanalysis, and also for measuring project results and impacts.   \n(iv)  Options  analysis.  Prepare  and  analyze  technical,  institutional,  and  financial \noptions  for  improving  sanitation  and  hygiene  in  the  selected  project \nneighborhoods. Options analysis should be guided by ADB\u2019s model TOR on \nSanitation and Wastewater Management Options Analysis (www.adb.org/water), and \ninnovative  approaches  should  be  considered.  The  participatory  hygiene  and \nsanitation transformation (PHAST) approach should be considered. It is expected \nthat the core TL will be familiar with and experienced in applying PHAST. The \noptions will also consider sustainability and O&M. \n(v)  Agreed-upon approaches. Use a consultative approach\u2500preferably the MPA \napproach (as modified)\u2500to consider and agree with stakeholders on the options \nto be used. Options will describe the approach the project will take to improving \nsanitation and hygiene in each type of neighborhood. \n ", "14  Appendix 4 \n(vi)  Feasibility studies. Prepare feasibility studies for all sanitation improvements \nand hygiene support to be funded by the project. These will be site specific and \nbe  of  a  quality  normally  required  for  SPARs.  In  situations  where  numerous \nsmaller  sites  would  be  improved  using  similar  technology  and  approach, \nindividual SPARs for all sites would not be required and a summary feasibility \nanalysis  may  be  applied.  SPARS  will  cover  technical,  institutional,  social, \nfinancial,  economic,  and  environmental  aspects  and  will  be  suitable  as \nsupplementary appendixes to the draft RRP. \n(vii)  Cost estimates, financing, and project documents. Prepare cost estimates \nand financing plan for all the project\u2019s sanitation improvements and hygiene \ninputs  in  a  form  compatible  with  COSTAB-based  analysis  and  aggregation. \nPrepare a detailed component description, core appendixes, and supplementary \nappendixes appropriate for the draft RRP. \n \nB.  Reporting on Project Preparation \n5.  To  ensure  that  the  project  is  prepared  to  a  stage  ready  for  ADB  and  government \nappraisal, the consultant will undertake the following: \n \n(i)  Prepare  SPAR-standard  reports  for  all  project  sites,  or  summary  feasibility \nreports for numerous small sites that have common characteristics and project \napproach. \n(ii)  Prepare  a  detailed  project  cost  estimate  using  COSTAB,  applying  a  3-year \nproject  period.  Include  physical  and  price  contingencies,  and  interest  during \nconstruction; break each cost component into foreign and local sources,3 and \nindicate the associated taxes and duties.4 Determine the ratio of cost sharing, \nboth cash and in-kind (community, private sector and civil society, ADB, and \ncentral and district governments) for each component and implementation stage, \nincluding O&M. \n(iii)  Prepare  a  financing  plan  for  the  project  using  COSTAB,  and  describe  the \nchanneling  of  funds  as  well  as  cost  recovery  measures  and  means  where \napplicable. \n(iv)  Define all arrangements for project implementation. Demonstrate the relationship \nbetween  relevant  institutions  and  organizations,  and  indicate  the  chain  of \ncommand  and  responsibilities  for  project  implementation  on  a  flow  chart. \nEstimate the numbers and specify the expertise of consulting staff, central and \nDili  district  government  staff,  staff  from  civil  society  organizations,  and \ncommunity/private  sector  participants  in  relation  to  a  phased  implementation \nschedule,  and  identify  training  needs  for  the  Project.  Describe  procurement \nmethods  and  packages.  Prepare  draft  TOR  for  project  implementation  and \nmanagement consulting services, identify international and domestic consultants\u2019 \ntasks, and cost out the proposals. \n(v)  Undertake economic analyses of the project components in accordance with \nADB  guidelines5  and  models  developed  by  ADB\u2019s  Economics  Research \nDepartment.  In  addition  to  assessing  the  project\u2019s  economic  feasibility,  the \neconomist  will  thoroughly  analyze  WatSan  user  charges  and  each \n                                                 \n3  Since the currency of Timor-Leste is the US dollar, \u201csource\u201d is more relevant than \u201ccurrency\u201d. \n4 At the time of writing, ADB was considering a streamlining initiative that includes, for instance, enabling ADB to \nfinance previously precluded project items such as local taxes and duties. \n5  The following ADB guidelines will be used: Guidelines for Water Supply Projects, Handbook for Integrating Poverty \nImpact in Economic Analysis of Project, and New Guidelines for Economic Analysis of Projects. \n ", "  Appendix 4  15 \nneighborhood\u2019s priorities for developing public services. The economist will help \ndesign  a  methodology  for  selecting  project  neighborhoods/sites.  Innovative \napproaches should be considered, such as different user charges for different \nsupply zones with different standards of service.  \n(vi)  Undertake  financial  analyses  of  the  project  components,  including  financial \nprojections  for  WSS  and  a  financial  management  capacity  assessment  in \nconformance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Financial Governance and Investment \nProjects. The consultants will also be guided by notes on financial analysis and \nmanagement  prepared  by  the  Regional  and  Sustainable  Development \nDepartment. \n(vii)  Prepare a poverty and social analysis and strategy for the project following the \nguidelines  in  ADB\u2019s  Handbook  on  Poverty  and  Social  Analysis  and  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Incorporation of Social Dimensions as supplemented by guidelines \nfrom the ADB specialist staff.  \n(viii)  Conduct gender analysis as part of the poverty and social analysis and strategy, \nand  prepare  a  project-specific  gender  plan  with  specific  targets  and  design \nfeatures.  Results  from  the  MPA  and  PHAST  during  baseline  surveys  and \nanalysis will inform the gender plan. \n(ix)  Screen all project sites for any involuntary resettlement impacts as defined in \nADB\u2019s  Operations  Manual  Group  F  Number  2  on  Involuntary  Resettlement \n(2003), and for each SPAR/site prepare a resettlement plan in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Resettlement Policy (1995), Operations Manual Group F Number 2, and \nADB\u2019s Handbook on Resettlement: A Guide to Good Practice (1998). \n(x)  Include in SPARs a comprehensive appraisal of environmental impacts in line \nwith ADB's Environmental Assessment Requirements and Environmental Review \nProcedures  (refer  to  www.adb.org/environment/policy).  Environmental \nassessments  will  have  due  regard  to  the  (a)  draft  Environmental  Impact \nAssessment Law of Timor-Leste, and (b) draft Pollution Control Law of Timor-\nLeste.  The  consultant  will  assign  responsibility  for  preparing  the  necessary \nenvironmental assessments to one of the following: the WatSan specialist/senior \nengineer, the WatSan junior engineer, or the urban environmental sanitation \nspecialist. \n(xi)  Prepare  a  project  performance  management  system  (PPMS)  and  project \nframework in line with ADB\u2019s new results-based PPMS regime.  \n \nC.  Reporting Requirements \n \n6.  The TA will last for 6 months and activities will overlap. The consultants will produce (i) \nan inception report by the end of 1 month, (ii) an interim report by the end of 3 months, (iii) a \ndraft final report and draft RRP with appendixes and supplementary appendixes by the end of 5 \nmonths, and (iv) a final report by the end of 6 months.
