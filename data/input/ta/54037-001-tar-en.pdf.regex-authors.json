INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) has requested knowledge and \nsupport technical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) on innovation-driven \ngreen economic diversification for resource-exhausted cities in Heilongjiang Province. The TA will \nbuild on previous ADB projects in the northeast of the PRC and provide support in research, \nstrategic planning, policy recommendations, and knowledge dissemination to advance innovation \nas part of a comprehensive strategy to enable green economic diversification. \n \n2.  The TA is included in the list of projects agreed between ADB and the Government of the \nPRC on 22 January 2020.1 The TA is in line with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, which supports the \noperational priority on making cities more livable; the corresponding operational plan; and ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership strategy for the PRC, 2016\u20132020.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Economic development of resource-dependent cities relies on the extraction and basic \nprocessing of natural resources. Cities with declining resource-dependent development and \naccumulative  recovered  reserves  exceeding  70%  of  recoverable  reserves  are  defined  as \nresource-exhausted  cities  and  are  facing  more  urgent  needs  for  economic  diversification. \nHeilongjiang Province is part of the northeast of the PRC and has a population of 37.73 million in \n2019.3 With resource-dependent industry as one of its economic pillars, the province has been \nlosing its growth momentum since the late 1990s, going through economic recession and \npopulation outflow.4 The province has 10 officially listed resource-exhausted cities, or 14% of the \ntotal number in the PRC.5  Heilongjiang\u2019s resource-exhausted cities face development challenges, \nincluding economic underperformance, business failures, rising unemployment, decreased tax \nrevenue, and difficulty in making new investments. The cities\u2019 gross domestic product and per \ncapita disposable income are below the province\u2019s average.6 They also suffer from severe \nenvironmental degradation caused by extraction of natural resources, high energy consumption, \nand highly polluting industrial emissions. \n \n4.  The  PRC\u2019s  new  urbanization  and  ecological  civilization  agenda  recognizes  that  the \neconomic  transformation  and  sustainable  development  of  resource-exhausted  cities  is  an \nimportant  strategy  (footnote  6).  The  national  government  and  the  Heilongjiang  Provincial \nGovernment  have  formulated  development  plans  to  transform  their  singular  and  resource-\ndependent economy towards a more diverse, high-value, and low-carbon development.7 Guided \nby these plans, the governments of these resource-exhausted cities have identified their target \n \n1  The TA title, originally \"Industrial Structure Transformation and Upgrading of Resource-Exhausted Cities,\" was \nadjusted to better reflect the scope of the TA.  \n2  ADB. Strategy 2030 Operational Plan for Priority 4: Making Cities More Livable, 2019\u20132024; and ADB. Country \nPartnership Strategy: Transforming Partnership: People\u2019s Republic of China and Asian Development Bank, 2016\u2013\n2020. The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 16 September 2020. \n3  Heilongjiang Bureau of Statistics. 2019 Heilongjiang Statistical Yearbook (accessed 24 July 2020). \n4  The gross domestic product average annual growth rate of Heilongjiang from 2016 to 2018 is 2.5%, which is below \nthe national rate of 6.7%. The average annual population growth rate in Heilongjiang from 2016 to 2018 is \u20130.34%. \n5  The 10 resource-exhausted cities in Heilongjiang Province are Aihui, Daxinganling, Hegang, Jiameng, Jixi, Qitaihe, \nTieli, Wudalianchi, Xunke, and Yichun. \n6  Government of the PRC. 2013.

Initial progress has been made \nin urban infrastructure improvement, reconstruction of shantytowns and industrial and mining \nareas, and environmental remediation. However, much remains to be done. Because the validity \nperiod of current development plans ends in 2020, Heilongjiang Province is preparing new plans \nto  continue  to  guide  the  long  and  comprehensive  diversification  process,  i.e.,  through  the \nFourteenth Five-Year Plan, 2021\u20132025 and beyond. \n \n5.  Current development plans recognize innovation as one of the key drivers of green \neconomic diversification, but the innovation capacity of the resource-exhausted cities is still \nrelatively low. This has constrained effective technology transfer, entrepreneurial activities, and \ncompetitive  business  models  and  financial  instruments,  which  are  needed  for  the  key \ndiversification tasks of developing small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and high-value \ngreen industries (such as green food processing and tourism). The long-standing insular economy \nand dominance of large state-owned enterprises in Heilongjiang have dampened the spirit of \ninnovation in local society. The lack of awareness and weak incentive mechanism for human \ncapital retention has led to a shortage of innovative human capital, including entrepreneurs, \nmanagers, and technical professionals. Although innovation facilities and platforms have been \ndeveloped in Heilongjiang, the innovation systems remain weak in terms of inter-organizational \ncooperation, intermediary services, and other regulatory frameworks.8 Heilongjiang Province \nneeds to comprehensively address these gaps from social, human capital development, and \ninstitutional  aspects  in  the  new  development  plans  for  resource-exhausted  cities,  placing \ninnovation-enabling systems and institutions at the forefront. \n \n6.  Lessons learned. ADB has been helping Heilongjiang Province diversify its resource-\ndependent economy towards more green and sustainable development. These projects have \nidentified the need to move to high-value green economic activities and to develop the private \nsector and SMEs.9 Of these projects, the two ongoing loans have (i) formulated comprehensive \neconomic diversification strategies and a road map for four coal-rich cities; and (ii) supported \nimplementation of the road map, including SME financing, urban infrastructure investments, and \nremediation and environmental cleanup from mining impacts. This TA will build on lessons \nlearned from these and other relevant projects and will focus on advancing innovation to further \nenable green economic diversification. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The  TA  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  sustainable  development  of  resource-\ndependent cities enabled (footnote 6). The TA will have the following outcome:  innovation-driven \ngreen  economic  diversification  development  planning  for  resource-exhausted  cities  in \nHeilongjiang strengthened.10 \n \n \n \n8  The organizations in the innovation ecosystem include universities, research institutes, companies and related \ngovernment agencies, and civil society organizations. The intermediary services refer to finance, tax, and legal \nservices that will enable innovation. \n9  ADB. Provincial Development Strategies for Two Northeastern Provinces; ADB.

Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n8.  Output  1:  Research  on  innovation-driven  green  economic  diversification  for \nresource-exhausted cities produced. Output 1 will analyze international and national best \npractices of cities that have successfully improved their innovation capacity and transformed their \nresource-dependent economy, with the aim of drawing lessons in effective innovative human \ncapital retention and innovation ecosystem strengthening. The TA consultants will facilitate an \ninternational  study tour  for  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  to  survey  successful \npractices and gain practical knowledge in strategic planning and policy making to strengthen the \ninnovation-enabling environment. Output 1 will also design a simulation model to gauge the \ninnovation level of the resource-exhausted cities in Heilongjiang and analyze the impact of \nnecessary conditions or determinants of innovation.11 The TA consultants will collect baseline \ndata of the 10 resource-exhausted cities and conduct a diagnostic study to identify the constraints, \nchallenges, and opportunities for innovation-driven green economic diversification. \n \n9.  Output 2: Innovation-driven green economic diversification strategy and policy \nframework  for  resource-exhausted  cities  proposed.  In  response  to  the  findings  of  the \ndiagnostic study, Output 2 will recommend a strategy and road map to foster the innovation-\nenabling  environment  that  will  support  the  development  of  the  private  sector,  SMEs,  and \ndesignated high-value green industries in the resource-exhausted cities. The strategy and road \nmap  will  focus  on  strengthening  (i)  the  incentive  mechanism  for  innovative  human  capital \nretention; (ii) inter-organizational networking and collaboration (footnote 8); and (iii) intermediary \nservices in finance, tax, legal, and other regulatory frameworks. The TA consultants will consult \nwith  government  agencies  on  the  recommended  strategy  and  road  map.  To  underpin  the \nachievement of the strategic objectives, Output 2 will prepare a policy framework providing \nguidance towards sound policy design, formulation, implementation, and evaluation. Key policy \nrecommendations will be identified through the facilitation of the simulation model. \n \n10.  Output  3:  Knowledge  on  innovation-driven  green  economic  diversification  for \nresource-exhausted  cities  enhanced.  Output  3  will  deliver  two  workshops  and  a  final \nconference  to  discuss  and  disseminate  TA  findings  and  policy  recommendations.  The  TA \nconsultants will prepare a bilingual knowledge product on innovation-driven green economic \ndiversification for resource-exhausted cities and will submit a TA final report to Heilongjiang \nProvincial Finance Department (HPFD) and ADB. The TA consultants will disseminate the \nknowledge product to policy makers and practitioners through HPFD. The TA consultants will \nhand over the simulation model to an institution that will continue to support policy making \nprocesses to create an innovation-enabling environment in Heilongjiang Province. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The key expenditure items \nare listed in Appendix 2. \n \n12.  The  government  will  provide  counterpart  support  in the  form  of  provision  for  office \naccommodation,  venues  for  meetings,  counterpart  staff  and  allowances,  miscellaneous \nadministration expenses, and other in-kind contributions. \n \n11  Simulation technologies, such as system dynamics, are methodological and mathematical modeling techniques to \nframe, understand, and discuss complex issues and problems; they are being used in the public and private sectors \nfor policy analysis and design. \n ", "4 \nD.
