I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Hunan Technical and Vocational Education and \nTraining (TVET) Demonstration Project.1 \n \n2.  The  project  seeks  to  improve  the  quality  and  relevance  of  formal  TVET  in  Hunan \nprovince.  Quality  improvements  include  developing  competency-based  standards  and \ncurriculum, training vocational instructors, and strengthening TVET management capacity in \nHunan\u2019s TVET institutions to support inclusive and environmentally sustainable development. A \nkey  project  focus  is  on  strengthening  industry  participation  in  TVET  and  ensuring  greater \nalignment between TVET and labor market needs.2   \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  The PRC is one of the fastest growing economies, with an average annual growth rate of \nover 9.0% since the 1980s. The government\u2019s 12th Five-Year Plan, 2011\u20132015, targets annual \ngross domestic product (GDP) growth of 7.5%. Despite impressive growth, the PRC is facing a \nnumber of urgent development challenges. The government\u2019s key priorities include restructuring \nthe economy from production and export to consumption-oriented growth, from low to higher \nvalue-added industries, and supporting rapid urbanization and environmentally sustainable and \nsocially inclusive development\u2014all of which require significant investments in human capital. \nStrengthening human resources through the development of TVET is one of the key priorities \nunder the 12th Five-Year Plan. \n \n4.  The PRC is experiencing skill and labor shortages. National labor market data from \n91 cities in 2012 showed that demand exceeded supply in almost all technical and skilled \ncategories.  The  PRC\u2019s  comparative  advantage  in  low-skilled  labor-intensive  production  is \nexpected to decline, with the economy shifting to more skill-intensive products and production \ntechnologies. The Government of the PRC is increasingly emphasizing the value of highly \nskilled human capital. In 2010, the central government identified TVET as the key target for \neducational expansion to develop a skilled work force, and approved the National Long-Term \nStrategy on Education, 2010\u20132020. The education plan sets up goals and reforms to better \nalign the education system with the demands of economic and social development. \n \n5.  Hunan is a province with a population of 70 million, located in the south central part of \nthe PRC. The GDP per capita of Hunan in 2011 was $4,742, below the national average of \n$5,583. In 2011, 9.08 million people, or 15.9% of the rural registered population in Hunan lived \nbelow the national poverty line, higher than the national average of 13.4%.3  \n \n6.  The  structure  of  Hunan\u2019s  economy  is  undergoing  fundamental  transformation.  The \nGovernment of the PRC\u2019s policy of geographical rebalancing of economic growth toward inland \nprovinces has led to Hunan\u2019s emergence as an important industrial base, requiring a large and \nmulti-skilled  work  force.  Hunan\u2019s  pillar  industries  include  manufacturing,  automobile, \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance. ADB. 2011. Technical \nAssistance to the People's Republic of China for Preparing the Technical and Vocational Education and Training \nDemonstration Project. Manila. \n3   Based on the poverty line of CNY2,300 in annual net income per capita, established in 2012. ", "2   \nbiotechnology, natural resources and energy, and information technology. The growth rate of \nthe manufacturing and services sectors in Hunan has been higher than the national average, \nparticularly for the manufacturing sector, which contributed 56.0% to Hunan\u2019s GDP in 2010. \nDemand for skilled workers in Hunan exceeded supply in 2011, with manufacturing having the \nhighest demand. Hunan ranks 19th in the PRC in terms of educational attainment, with an \naverage level of educational attainment of 9.1 years. The urbanization level of Hunan was \n45.0% in 2011, and is forecast to grow to 66.0% by 2030. Increased industrialization and \nurbanization, and the subsequent transformation of livelihood bases, will require skilled workers. \n \n7.  Since 2007, Hunan provincial government (HPG) has been actively pursuing reforms in \nthe TVET sector. Investment in TVET development has played an important role in helping \ndisadvantaged people gain new skills and enjoy the growth benefits, as over 80% of students \nenrolled in Hunan\u2019s TVET institutions are from rural areas or low-income urban families. Despite \nimpressive progress, TVET development in Hunan faces a number of challenges, including \n(i) limited  industry  involvement, (ii)  lack  of  accurate  and  consistently  sourced  labor  market \ninformation, (iii) outdated curriculum and teaching and learning materials, (iv) need to upgrade \ninstructional skills and workplace experience of vocational instructors, (v) inadequate TVET \ninstitution management capacity to strengthen linkages between schools and industry, and \n(vi) lack of and/or obsolete equipment to simulate a workplace for practical demonstration and \napplication.  \n \n8.  Greater involvement of enterprises in advising and directing the TVET system is critical \nto increase TVET\u2019s responsiveness to labor market needs. HPG established industry advisory \ngroups (IAGs) as a way to foster industry involvement in TVET, but the capacity of the IAGs to \nengage with industry needs to be strengthened. While demand for workers is strong in Hunan \nand  placement rates for graduates  are  high  (over  80%  in  many TVET  institutions), TVET \ninstitutions are faced with the challenge of updating their programs to meet the demands of new \nindustries, and upgrading older industries.  \n \n9.  To address these challenges, the project will provide targeted support to 13 public TVET \ninstitutions in Hunan to strengthen the capability to deliver demand-driven quality programs \nrelated to priority industries. The project will build the capacity of IAGs and foster partnerships \nbetween 13 project TVET institutions and employers to jointly develop the skills needed in the \nworkplace, and prepare graduates who are able to adjust to changing demands in the labor \nmarket quickly; modernize the curriculum by developing competency-based curriculum (CBC) in \npriority  areas;  upgrade  the  instructional  capacity  of  vocational  instructors  and  build  TVET \nmanagement capacity; strengthen market-oriented program planning through improved labor \nmarket information system (LMIS); and upgrade equipment and facilities in selected TVET \ninstitutions.  \n \n10.  Strategic fit. The project is the first Asian Development Bank (ADB)-financed lending \nproject  for  TVET  in  the  PRC  and  is  envisaged  to  play  a  demonstration  role  for  TVET \ndevelopment in the country. Because lack of worker skills and education are viewed as a \nconstraint to the PRC\u2019s  inclusive growth, ADB involvement in the TVET sector is strongly \njustified. The project supports ADB\u2019s education policy and education sector strategies and \nStrategy  2020.4 It  aligns  with  ADB\u2019s  PRC  country  partnership  strategy,  2011\u201320155 and \nsupports  the  PRC\u2019s  12th  Five-Year  Plan,  which  prioritizes  developing  high-quality  human \n                                                \n4  ADB. 2008.

The project has the following demonstration features for replication in other provinces \nand autonomous regions of the PRC:  \n \n(i)  Enhancing  industry  involvement.  The  project  will  strengthen  partnerships \nbetween  TVET  institutions  and  industries,  and  build  the  capacity  of  sector-\nspecific IAGs in the priority sectors. \n(ii)  Promoting  inclusive  technical  and  vocational  education  and  training \nthrough  information  and  communication  technology.  The  project  will \nbroaden  access for  students from  remote  areas  by  developing  online  TVET \ncourses, and thus foster sharing of teaching and learning resources among well-\ndeveloped TVET institutions in urban areas and less-developed TVET institutions \nin poor and remote areas to benefit students in project and non-project TVET \ninstitutions.  \n(iii)  Greening technical and vocational education and training provision. The \nproject will contribute to the Government of the PRC\u2019s objectives of developing \nan environmentally sustainable and energy-efficient society under its 12th Five-\nYear Plan by designing, constructing, and maintaining teaching and learning \nbuildings that reduce energy and water use, and promoting sustainable practices \nsuch as reducing, reusing, and recycling resources; encouraging the selection of \ntraining equipment with low energy consumption; and skills mapping to identify \nskills needed for environmentally sustainable development in Hunan.   \n \n11.   Incorporation  of  the  lessons  learned.  Lessons  from  activities  in  skills  training \nsupported by ADB and the World Bank were incorporated into the project design. Lessons \ninclude (i) actively involving representatives of industries and IAGs in identifying occupational \nareas that are in demand, developing competencies for market-demanded occupational areas, \nand working with the project TVET institutions to develop modular, CBC and learning materials; \n(ii) conducting tracer studies of the trainees, and strengthening the capacity of the relevant \ngovernment agencies and the TVET institutions to analyze labor market demand; and (iii) \nestablishing a project benefit monitoring and evaluation system. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The impact of the proposed project will be that adequate skilled human resources are \navailable to contribute to inclusive growth and social development in Hunan province. The \noutcome will be strengthened capacity of the formal TVET system to meet labor market needs. \n \nC.  Outputs \n13.   Output  1:  Improved  quality  and  relevance  of  the  technical  and  vocational \neducation  and  training  system.

DUE DILIGENCE \n21.  The project will directly benefit over 86,000 full-time students in certificate and diploma \ncourses who will access quality study programs closely aligned to the needs of employers over \n5 years of the project duration. Employers will benefit from improvements in the quality and \nrelevance  of  TVET  as  improved  skill  levels  are  directly  linked  to  improving  workplace \nproductivity, product quality, and service standards. By improving the quality and relevance of \nstudy programs, community and industry confidence in the TVET system to provide a pathway \nto meaningful employment will increase. The instructor development program will enable up to \n2,000  instructors  to  be  up-skilled  through  improved  in-service  teacher  training.  TVET \nmanagement  capacity  building  will  enable  up  to  500  TVET  managers  to  strengthen  their \nmanagement skills through improved management training programs. \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n22.  Economic benefits. The economic benefits from the project will be derived mainly from \nthe incremental productivity gains resulting from improved quality and efficiency of training, \nexpressed in terms of the incremental income of the graduates. The direct economic benefits \nfrom the project will flow from the increased numbers of TVET graduates who will find direct \nemployment.  Based  on  conservative  assumptions,  such  targeted  skills  development  can \nincrease monthly wages by CNY76. Estimating these benefits over 25 years, based on the total \nproject cost of $105.84 million, yields an economic internal rate of return of 16.9%. Individual \neconomic internal rates of return have been computed for each TVET institution and yield \nsatisfactory results. These are documented in the economic analysis.9 Other indirect benefits of \nthe project, which will most likely accrue to society at large and not just the direct beneficiaries \nof the project, are (i) improvements in the provision of quality skills at selected TVET institutions \nwill also benefit non-project TVET institutions and thereby improve the quality and relevance of \nthe sector to the needs of industry, and (ii) enhanced responsiveness of TVET will improve the \nrelevance of skills and employment outcomes of graduates beyond project completion.  \n \n23.  Financial sustainability. A financial sustainability analysis was undertaken during project \npreparation, based on fiscal impact. The project should be financially sustainable as the bulk of \nexpenditures do not carry on beyond the end of the project. Recurrent expenditures such as \nequipment maintenance cost can be absorbed by additional revenues from government funding, \ntuition fees, and tailored training for enterprises. The financial analysis shows that during fiscal \nyears 2009\u20132011, total recurrent expenditure for TVET has almost doubled from CNY2.7 billion \nto CNY4.7 billion, indicating the relative importance given to increasing skills improvement in \nHunan.10 The project will increase the labor market relevance of the TVET system, and this will \nimprove the sustainability of the TVET sector by making it better serve Hunan\u2019s socioeconomic \ndevelopment needs. Efficiency gains in the 13 project TVET institutions will also be realized \nthrough  increased  enrolments  and  higher  utilization  of  facilities  and  equipment.  The \ngovernment\u2019s annual commitment to the project as a percentage of the total education budget is \nprojected to increase from 0.03% in year 1 of the project to 0.18% in year 3, and decrease to \n0.05% by year 5. The government\u2019s annual commitment to the project is therefore deemed \naffordable. \n \n                                                \n9  Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n10  Table 2 in the Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8   \nB.  Governance  \n24.  Financial management and procurement capacity assessment. The project will be \nADB\u2019s fourth project to Hunan, which is successfully managing other projects funded by bilateral \nand  multilateral  financing  institutions. 11  The  financial  management  assessment  (FMA) \nconducted for the project management office (PMO) and the implementing agencies indicates \nthat they have sufficient financial management capacity and project management experience \nbut lack knowledge of ADB financial management, disbursement, and procurement guidelines. \nThe project includes the provision of training and advice to the PMO and implementing agencies \nin ADB procedures, including procurement, disbursement, and accounting systems. The project \nwill also support TVET institutions to undertake the necessary financial reporting required under \nthe project\u2019s financial compliance requirements. The FMA undertaken and the completed FMA \nquestionnaires are included in the full project financial analysis.12 Recommended improvements \nin the FMA have been incorporated into the project design and are documented in the PAM. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with \nHPG  and  the  PMO.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the PAM (footnote 8). \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n25.  The project contributes to the central and provincial government\u2019s poverty alleviation \nstrategies of enhancing the employability and skills of the labor force. In Hunan Province, over \n80% of TVET students are from rural and low-income backgrounds. The project will support \nHunan\u2019s distance education platform, which can reach thousands of adult learners in Hunan \nevery year through short-term distance learning courses to improve the skills of farmers and \nrural migrants. This will help ensure socially inclusive TVET and serve as a model for other \nprovinces seeking to increase the impact and scope of their TVET programs. The project will \nmake selected online TVET courses available on Hunan\u2019s TVET portal for vocational schools in \nremote, poor areas, thus providing benefits to students from rural areas in non-project schools.  \n   \n26.  Gender and development. The project is categorized effective gender mainstreaming \nand includes a social and gender action plan (SGAP) to facilitate and promote the increased \nparticipation  and  employment  of  female  students  in  priority  industries.  Gender  analysis  of \nstudents and staff at the project TVET institutions revealed a broad gender balance in overall \nstudent and teaching numbers, but a significant under-representation of women in management \nlevel jobs in the TVET institutions and a gender imbalanced enrolment depending on fields of \nstudy. The key gender issues addressed by the project include (i) limited access of females to \nnontraditional quality skill development programs, (ii) limited access to management training \nand teacher training among female instructors, (iii) gender stereotypes in the curriculum, and \n(iv) lack of knowledge related to the range of study programs and career prospects for females \nin male dominant skill areas. The SGAP includes the following targets and gender-responsive \ndesign features: (i) at least 40% of instructors trained  will be female, (ii) at least 40% of \nmanagers trained will be female, (iii) a social marketing campaign  will be implemented to \npromote female participation in nontraditional trades in priority sectors, (iv) gender indicators will \nbe developed in the pilot LMIS, and (v) gender monitoring and evaluation indicators will be \nintegrated in the overall design and monitoring framework to track SGAP implementation. The \n                                                \n11  More information on the experience of Hunan Provincial Finance Department, HED, and the PMO in managing \nprojects funded by bilateral and other multilateral financing institutions is available in the linked document on \ndevelopment coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n12  Full Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nproject  will  conduct  a  study  on  access  to  TVET  for  disadvantaged  groups  during  loan \nimplementation. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n27.  Environment.  The  project  is  classified  category  B  for  environment.  An  initial \nenvironment examination (IEE) including environmental management plan (EMP) was prepared \nand was disclosed on the ADB website on 12 February 2013. The IEE complies with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  The  IEE  concludes  that  the  project\u2019s  anticipated \nenvironmental impacts can be mitigated through the implementation of the EMP. During the \nconstruction of new buildings and facilities on existing school campuses, some environmental \nimpacts are anticipated including noise, fugitive dust, solid wastes, and risks to community and \noccupational health and safety. Overall, construction-related impacts are localized, short-term, \nand can be effectively mitigated through the application of good construction practices and the \nimplementation of construction phase community and occupational health and safety plans. \nDuring operation, no major environmental impacts are anticipated. The EMP defines mitigation \nmeasures,  monitoring  requirements,  and  institutional  responsibilities  to  ensure  proper \nenvironmental management throughout the project construction and operation. Environmental \nmanagement  is  supported  by  loan  covenants,  and  capacity  development  and  institutional \nstrengthening  activities  under  the  project.  The  PMO  will  establish  a  grievance  redress \nmechanism and handle any dispute arising from noncompliance with the EMP.  \n \n28.  Resettlement. The involuntary resettlement category is C. The project activities will \nneither require land acquisition nor resettlement. Resettlement due diligence was conducted, \nwhich confirmed that there are no legacy issues from the time the campuses were established.  \n \n29.  Indigenous people. The indigenous peoples\u2019 category is C. No project activities will \nadversely affect indigenous people. The poverty and social assessment determined that ethnic \nminority students are well integrated into all the project TVET institutions. Increased quality of \nTVET as a result of the project will benefit all students, including ethnic minorities. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n30.
