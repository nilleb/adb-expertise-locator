THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \n1.  Despite  its  impressive  gains  in  health  outcomes,  Bhutan  still  faces  considerable \nchallenges to sustain and further improve health sector performance. The rise in lifestyle-related \nnoncommunicable diseases is significantly driving up the cost of health care. Rapid urbanization \nhas also created new gaps in service coverage, leaving a growing urban migrant population \nunderserved.  At  the  same  time,  the  health  sector  still  grapples  with  persistent  regional \ndisparities in health outcomes and service coverage. Moreover, health security risks to this \nonce-secluded country have increased because of growing cross-border activities, direct air \nconnectivity with large regional hubs, and reliance on a large number of expatriate workers. \nSustainable health financing also needs critical attention given the rising costs of health care \namid the backdrop of significantly reduced donor assistance. Several structural constraints \nmake it difficult for Bhutan to tackle these evolving problems, including (i) inadequate primary \nhealth care (PHC) service delivery; (ii) insufficient health sector financing; and (iii) inefficient \nsector management, particularly fragmented health information management. \n \n2.  The  sector  development  program  (SDP)  will  support  efforts  of  the  government  to \nimprove the equity, efficiency, and sustainability of Bhutan\u2019s health system. The SDP comprises \n(i) a project, financed by a project grant, to invest in PHC improvements; and (ii) a program, \nfinanced by a policy-based grant, to support governance and institutional improvements in the \nareas of health financing and health information management. The SDP will also advance \nBhutan\u2019s  health  security  agenda  through  strategic  support  for  prevention  and  control  of \ninfectious diseases in line with Bhutan\u2019s commitment to the International Health Regulations \n(2005). \n \n3.  Impact, outcome, and outputs. The impact is aligned with the National Health Policy \nvision for a healthy and happy nation. The outcome will be that equitable access, efficiency, and \nfinancial sustainability of the health system have improved. The SDP will have three outputs. The \nproject grant will support output 1 for PHC service delivery improvements in selected areas. The \npolicy-based grant will support outputs 2 and 3 for more health financing and stronger health \ninformation management.  \n \n4.  Output 1: Primary health services in underserved areas improved. This project-\nbased output will support improvements in PHC service delivery, especially in underserved \nareas.  Investments  will  support  (i)  the  construction  of  five  PHC  satellite  clinics  in  urban \nperipheries of Thimphu and Phuentsholing; (ii) upgrades to primary health facilities resulting in \nbetter  infrastructure  provisions  for  infection  control  and  waste  management;  (iii)  medical \nequipment for enhanced PHC service delivery, including immunization and transportation of \nlaboratory samples; (iv) capacity development of health workers to roll out the Bhutan Health \nStandards and Quality Assurance mechanism at primary health facilities; and (v) public health \nadvocacy and behavior change communication through civil society organizations.  \n \n5.  Output 2: Health sector financing enhanced. This policy-based output will bolster \nhealth financing by improving equity and sustainability of the Bhutan Health Trust Fund (BHTF), \nwhose core mandate includes financing vaccines and supporting immunization, in line with \nInternational Health Regulation requirements. The policy actions cover measures to (i) enhance \nthe BHTF\u2019s operations by strengthening its capital base, capacity, and governance; (ii) make the \ndistribution of benefits from public health financing more equitable based on a benefit-incidence \nanalysis; and (iii) develop the legal basis that governs health financing equity, efficiency, and \nsustainability in the form of a health bill. Budget support provided by the Asian Development \n ", "2 \nBank  (ADB)  under  this  output  will  help  the  BHTF  to  increase  its  capital  and  diversify  its \ninvestments.  \n \n6.  Output  3:  Disease  surveillance  and  health  information  system  enhanced. This \npolicy-based output will improve sector management efficiency by catalyzing transformative \nchange in Bhutan\u2019s health information management, including for effective disease surveillance. \nThe program will facilitate the country\u2019s incremental move to an interoperable national health \ninformation system (HIS) from the now fragmented individual systems that are often redundant \nand ineffective to support decision-making in critical areas of health and disease management. \nPolicy actions include (i) development and adoption of a national e-health strategy, (ii) creation \nof an HIS governing body, (iii) development and adoption of an HIS enterprise architecture for \ninteroperability,  and  (iv)  development  and  adoption  of  technical  standards  for  health  data \nexchange.  \n \n7.  Overall financing. The SDP is estimated to cost $41.22 million. ADB will provide a grant \nof $20 million, comprising a project grant of $6 million equivalent, and a policy-based grant of \n$14 million. The government will provide counterpart funds totaling $21.22 million equivalent.  \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n8.  The transaction technical assistance (TA) will support the implementation of the policy-\nbased component of the SDP and assist the government in meeting the tranche conditions. The \ngovernment  and  the  BHTF  require  high-quality  technical  inputs  and  effective  institutional \ncapacity development through this TA to ensure that they meet the SDP policy objectives\u2014\n(i) BHTF is strengthened as a self-sustaining financial entity and can finance essential drugs \nand required vaccines on a sustainable basis; (ii) benefits from public financing of health in \nBhutan are more pro-poor and equitably distributed; and (iii) a strong and interoperable national \nHIS is established that meets Bhutan\u2019s data needs, including for effective disease surveillance \nand patient management. The TA is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2018\u2013\n2020 for Bhutan.1 \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n9.  The proposed TA will have two outputs aligned with the SDP to help the government \nenhance (i) health sector financing and (ii) the HIS. The broad activities to be supported include \nstrengthening the financial and institutional capacity of the BHTF, bolstering the capacity of the \nMinistry  of  Health  (MOH)  in  health  economics,  and  assisting  the  MOH  in  developing  the \nframework for an interoperable national HIS and strengthening e-health governance. \n \n1.  Output 1: Health Sector Financing Enhanced  \n \n10.  Bhutan Health Trust Fund capacity. This output will strengthen (i) the BHTF\u2019s financial \nand institutional capacity and (ii) the MOH\u2019s capacity in health economics to support key policy \ndecisions. The activities to bolster the BHTF\u2019s financial and fund management capacity involve \n(i) resource planning (e.g., 3-year rolling resource planning on an annual basis); (ii) quarterly \ninvestment  management  reporting  and  analysis  (e.g.,  risk-return  reporting,  performance \nanalysis,  investment  decision,  market  snapshot,  benchmarking  domestic  and  offshore \n                                                \n1   ADB. 2017. Country Operations Business Plan: Bhutan, 2018\u20132020. Manila.  \n ", "3 \ninvestments); and (iii) basic training on investment management through a consulting firm. \nSupport  for  enhanced  BHTF  institutional  functions  include  strengthening  its  (i)  operations \nmanual and providing implementation guidance; (ii) accounting capacity and procedures (i.e., \nimproving system, staff, and methodology); and (iii) capacity for mobilizing funds, including \nthrough web design and public communication. \n \n11.  Ministry  of  Health  policy  development.  The  TA  will  also  strengthen  the  MOH\u2019s \ncapacity in health economics to guide policy decisions. This includes assistance in (i) analytical \nwork to support the long-term health financing vision, and provide evidence for financing policy \nproducts, such as updated benefit-incidence analysis; and (iii) identifying and advocating ways \nto improve the efficiency of health spending.  \n \n2.  Output 2: Health Information System Enhanced  \n  \n12.  This  output  will  assist  the  MOH  in  developing  a  national  HIS  with  interoperable \nenterprise  architecture  and  strengthening  digital  governance.  It  involves  (i)  reviewing  the \ndifferent systems for data-sharing needs, the target system in which data should be shared, as \nwell as the data elements; (ii) integrating data from all systems into the national data warehouse \nto generate all required reports; and (iii) developing the specifications for an interoperable \nelectronic patient information system and for disease surveillance. To anchor and guide policy \ndirection and planning, the output would also help strengthen the legal and policy environment \nfor  e-health  in  the  country.  This  involves  (i) developing  policies  for  effective  planning, \nimplementation,  and  management  of  e-health;  (ii) advising  the  MOH  on  policies  related  to \ninformation  technology  security  that  will  guide  the  sharing  of  information  across  different \ninstitutions, health facilities, and practitioners; and (iii) providing recommendations on priorities \nand the operating framework. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $600,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s TA Special Fund (TASF 6). The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 1. \nThe government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office space, \nworkshop venues, and other in-kind contributions.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  ADB will administer the TA. The MOH will be the executing agency, and the BHTF will \nbe the implementing agency. The TA will be implemented over 2 years. Disbursements will be \nmade  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook  (2010,  as \namended from time to time).
