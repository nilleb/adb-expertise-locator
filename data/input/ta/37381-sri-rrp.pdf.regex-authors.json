Initial \nSafeguards Assessment  environmental examinations and an environmental management \nplan were prepared. \n \nThe  Project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  involuntary \nresettlement. Four resettlement plans were prepared. \n   \nRationale   Sri Lanka\u2019s northern dry zone receives little rainfall, mostly within \nthe short winter monsoon. Residents of the region experience \nincome and nonincome poverty. For decades, major towns have \naccommodated  those  displaced  by  the  civil  war.  Water  is \ntherefore essential to improve the lives of residents of this region \nand those affected by years of conflict. \n \nWater schemes in major towns have been stretched beyond their \ndesign life and have substantial inefficiencies; coverage is limited \nto a reduced number of beneficiaries; and standards are often not \nmet, which could impact the health of those served. Where piped \ndrinking  water  is  not  available,  water  is  extracted  from  other \nsources; however quality is often poor and seldom verified. In \naddition to limited access, water supplies are usually insufficient, \nparticularly at the end of the dry season. Demand and willingness \nto pay for water and sanitation are nonetheless high, particularly \nin  Mannar,  Puttalam,  and  Vavuniya.  As  water  supply \naugmentation  is  considered  in  emerging  regional  centers, \nwastewater and septage management must be addressed as an \nintegral part of the solution. \n \nThe problem analysis reveals that (i) access to basic facilities and \nservices, including water supply and sanitation, is restricted; and \nexisting infrastructure is inadequate, insufficient, and/or damaged; \n(ii)  water  resource  coordination  and  planning  are  weak,  and \nessential  policies  for  water  resource  management  are  lacking; \n(iii) operation and maintenance of existing assets is suboptimal; \nand (iv) institutional capacity is poor, and awareness among users \nand beneficiaries is inadequate. \n ", "ii   \nProject Description  The Project has three principal thrusts to support research and \ndata  collection,  institutional  development,  and  infrastructure \ninvestment. It comprises three components: Component 1 covers \nthe  rehabilitation,  expansion,  and  development  of  water  and \nsanitation infrastructure for major towns in the northwestern dry \nzone (Chilaw, Mannar, Puttalam, and Vavuniya), including urban \nand  periurban  water  supply,  and  septage  management  and \nsanitation. Component 2 provides the foundations to (i) support \ndecentralization of service delivery functions to regional offices; \n(ii)  improve  water  resource  management,  coordination,  and \nplanning ability; and (iii) increase public awareness. Component 3 \nis  designed  to  strengthen  institutional  capacity  for  project \nmanagement and implementation activities. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The expected impact of the Project is improved physical well-\nbeing of urban populations in Sri Lanka\u2019s northwestern dry zone. \nThe expected outcome is improved urban water and sanitation \nservices and management in Sri Lanka\u2019s urban northwestern dry \nzone. \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The investment cost of the Project is estimated at $113.3 million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $15.3 million.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  A loan of $59,780,000 equivalent and a grant of $23,220,000 from \nthe  Special  Funds  resources  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank \n(ADB) will be provided to finance the Project. Financing charges \nwill be 1% per year during the grace period and 1.5% during the \namortization  period  for  the  Asian  Development  Fund  loan.  In \naddition, a $2,000,000 grant from the Netherlands Trust Fund, \nadministered by ADB, for the Water Financing Partnership Facility \nwill help finance the Project. \n \n($ million) \nSource  Total  Percent \nAsian Development Bank  83.00  73.2 \n  Asian Development Fund Grant  23.22  20.5 \n  Asian Development Fund Loan  59.78  52.7 \nNetherlands Trust Fund for the Water     2.00    1.8 \nFinancing Partnership Facility  \nGovernment  28.33  25.0 \n  Total    113.33  100.0 \n   ", "  iii\nAllocation and Relending  The Government will pass on the loan proceeds to the National \nTerms  Water  Supply  and  Drainage  Board  (NWSDB)  as  a  blend  of \nGovernment grant and Government loan. The ratio of Government \ngrant and loan is based on urban and rural population ratios in the \nproject areas. Lending arrangements between the Government \nand NWSDB are as follows: funding for water supply schemes in \nareas  under  the  pradeshiya  sabhas  will  be  made  available  to \nNWSDB as a 85% grant and 15% a loan; funding for water supply \nin areas under the municipal and urban councils will be 50% grant \nand 50% loan; and financing for septage treatment schemes will \nbe provided as a 100% grant. In each case, Government loan \nfinancing will be at the rate of 10% per annum with a repayment \nperiod of 25 years and grace period of 5 years. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2014 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2013 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  NWSDB, under the Ministry of Water Supply and Drainage \n   \nImplementation  NWSDB  will  implement  most  of  the  activities.  Central  and \nArrangements  provincial  irrigation  departments  will  be  responsible  for \nimplementation of rehabilitation and improvement works for the \nElawankulama and Achchamolai reservoirs, and construction of a \nnew small reservoir on Per Aru. NWSDB, in close coordination \nwith urban councils in project towns, will implement the sanitation \nimprovement subcomponent. A small project coordination cell will \nbe established within NWSDB\u2019s head office; the cell will have \nmonitoring,  coordination,  and  supervisory  roles.  The  bulk  of \nactivities will be implemented by existing NWSDB regional offices \nthat will be duly strengthened. Vavuniya regional office will be \nresponsible for water supply and sanitation development works in \nVavuniya and Mannar. Puttalam regional office will be responsible \nfor water supply and sanitation development works in Puttalam \nand Chilaw. \n   \nProcurement  NWSDB\u2019s regional offices will carry out most of the procurement; \nwhile central and provincial irrigation departments, supported by \nthe project implementation consultants, will take responsibility for \nprocurement  activities  relating  to  tank  rehabilitation  and \nconstruction. Procurement of water supply and septage schemes \nwill follow procedures for international and national competitive \nbidding.  Goods  and  related  services,  and  civil  works  to  be \nfinanced from loan proceeds will be procured in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). \n ", "iv   \n  Civil  works  contracts  valued  over  $3.0  million  equivalent  and \nequipment  contracts  valued  over  $500,000  equivalent  will  be \nundertaken through international competitive bidding procedures, \nwhile civil works contracts valued at $3.0 million equivalent or less \nand equipment packages valued at $500,000 equivalent or less \nwill be procured following national competitive bidding procedures \nacceptable to ADB. Packages valued at $100,000 equivalent or \nless will be under shopping procedures. \n   \nConsulting Services  An estimated 871 person-months (86 international, 785 national) \nof  consulting  services  are  needed.  Consulting  services  are \nrequired to (i) facilitate project implementation and management; \nand  (ii)  strengthen  institutional,  administrative,  and  financial \ncapacities of the regional offices. NWSDB will recruit two firms, in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time). This includes (i) package \nA,  for  design  and  construction  supervision  support;  and \n(ii)  package  B,  for  institutional  development.  Package  A  will \ninclude  60  person-months  of  international  expertise  and  588 \nperson-months of national. In addition, about 788 person-months \nof technical and support staff will be provided under package A for \nproject implementation. Package B will include 11 person-months \nof international expertise and 79 person-months of national; while \npackage  C,  for  water  resource  management,  will  include  15 \nperson-months of international expertise and 118 person-months \nof national. The consulting firms will be engaged using the quality- \nand cost-based selection method with a standard quality-cost ratio \nof 80:20. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The Project will directly benefit approximately 200,000 people (at \nBeneficiaries  project  completion,  420,000  by  2030)  in  urban  areas  of  the \nnorthwestern  dry  zone  by  providing  safe  drinking  water  and \nimproved sanitation. In addition, around 100,000 will gain access \nto  improved  sanitation;  pit  desludging;  and  septage  handling, \ntreatment,  and  disposal.  More  than  400,000  will  benefit  from \nimproved water management and distribution, as well as improved \necology.  Increasing  access  to  safe  water,  and  improving \nsanitation will impact poverty reduction through improved public \nhealth resulting in reduced expenditures on medical expenses and \nreduced work days lost from sickness, and consequent increase \nin  labor  productivity  and  income.  Time  savings  from  water \ncollection,  particularly  for  women  and  children,  will  result  in \nincreased  time  for  productive  activities  and  improved  human \ncapital. Providing safe water supply will reduce productive time \nspent by women on water collection and release them from the \ntension  and  uncertainty  attached  to  depending  on  unreliable \nsources of water. \n   ", "  v\nRisks and Assumptions  The Project assumes (i) a stable political environment and positive \neconomic  growth,  particularly  in  Vavuniya  and  Mannar;  and \n(ii)  commitment  by  all  institutions  to  actively  participate  in  the \nplanning and development process. Specific monitoring measures \nare in place to mitigate this risk. NWSDB will brief ADB on the \nprogress of each of the packages, immediately highlighting any \ndisruption  associated  with  security  matters.  The  Project  will \nimplement  the  following  mitigation  measures:  (i)  careful  and \ncontinuous  monitoring  of  security  developments;  (ii)  preferred \nrecruitment of district-based qualified staff; (iii) continued dialogue \nwith stakeholders and aid partners; (iv) complete participatory and \ntransparent  implementation,  including  disclosure  of  financial \ninformation; (v) mobilization of strong community support and trust \nin project staff; and (vi) encouragement of local employment.   \n \nThe Government is expected to revise water tariffs on a timely \nbasis  to  meet  existing  cost-recovery  objectives  and  related \nfinancial considerations, and be independent of political influence. \n \nTo  mitigate  deviations  from  existing  population  and  demand \nprojections, the overall water supply strategy for Vavuniya and \nPuttalam is phased. The Project will provide resources to finance \nthe  first  stage.  Phasing  will  build  confidence  among  farmers. \nExtensive consultations, initiated under the feasibility study, will be \ncontinued  during  implementation,  ensuring  that  information  is \nconveyed and farmers\u2019 concerns are timely addressed. \n   \n \n ", "80 o 00'E 81o  30'E\nSRI  LANKA\nP a l k     S t r a i t KankasantKuoradiikamam DRY SZAONNIETA UTRIOBNA NP RWOAJTEECRT AND\nJaffna\nKilinochchi Project Area\nNational Capital\nP a l k     B a y\nChief Provincial Town\nMullaittivu City/Town\nTanniyuttu\nNational Road\nMankulam Provincial Road\nTalaimannar\n9 o 00'N NORTHERN Railway 9 o 00'N\nMannar Puliyankulam River\nProvincial Boundary\nVavuniya Boundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\nGulf   of   Mannar\nTrincomalee\nHorowupotana\nAnuradhapura\nNORTH  CENTRAL\nB a y     o f     B e n g a l\nTambuttegama\nPuttalam Kekirawa\nWelikanda\nPolonnaruwa Valaichchenai\nDambulla\nEASTERN\nBatticaloa\nNORTH\nChilaw WESTERN\nKurunegala Matale\nMadampe\nCENTRAL\nPolgahawela\nKandy\nMawanella Ampara\nNegombo Warakapola\nMinuwangoda Kegalle\nGampola\nGampaha\n7 o 00'N Talawakele Nuwara Eliya Badulla 7 o 00'N\nColombo Avissawella Welimada\nU V A\nSRI JAYAWARDENEPURA KOTTE Hatton Monaragala\nMoratuwa WESTERN Bandarawela\nRatnapura Wellawaya\nPelmadulla Balangoda\nKalutara\nSABARAGAMUWA\nAlutgama\nElpitiya\nAmbalangoda\nHikkaduwa SOUTHERN N\nAkuressa Hambantota\nGalle\nMatara Tangalle\n0 10 20 30 40 50\nKilometers\nI N D I A N      O C E A N\n80 o 00'E 81o  30'E\n08-4316 EG", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan,  (ii)  a  proposed  grant,  and  (iii)  proposed  administration  by  ADB  of  a  grant  from  the \nNetherlands Trust Fund for the Water Financing Partnership Facility to the Democratic Socialist \nRepublic of Sri Lanka, for the Dry Zone Urban Water and Sanitation Project. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  Country Performance. Strong economic growth over the past decade has resulted in \nimproving development indicators in Sri Lanka.1 Income poverty, as measured by the headcount \nratio,  declined  slowly  from  26.1%  in  1990  to  22.7%  in  2002;  however  income  inequality \nincreased. A recent study2 indicates that based on expenditure, the poverty headcount in 2007 \nwas 15.2%. In 2004, life expectancy was 74.3 years, adult literacy 90.7%, and gross domestic \nproduct per capita $1,031. The population with sustainable access to an improved water source \nis reported to have increased from 67% to 74%, between 1990 and 2005, whereas the fraction \nwith access to improved sanitation increased from 61% to 68% over the same period.3 Major \nchallenges  include  regional  disparities  and  urban\u2013rural  differences.  These  have  been \naccompanied by marked demographic changes relating to migration within the country and \nabroad.4 Medium-term prospects hinge on Government plans to foster economic growth by \nsignificantly raising foreign direct investment as well as domestic public and private investment. \nLarge infrastructure developments have been limited in recent years, resulting in economic \nbottlenecks. Development of secondary cities into strong regional centers capable of adequately \nserving  district  populations  and  operating  as  growth  engines  requires  special  attention, \nparticularly in more disadvantaged areas such as the northwestern and southeastern parts of \nthe country. While the southeastern region has received extensive support in recent years, this \nneeds to be extend to districts in the western and northern regions, in particular Mannar, \nPuttalam and Vavuniya. In addition to strategic development, the choice of project districts and \ntowns aims to address the dual hardship encountered in this region: (i) difficulties (economic \nand others) associated with living in an arid environment, and (ii) the critical role played in \naccommodating internally displaced populations, many of which have settled over time. \n \n3.  The Dry Zone. Sri Lanka's climate can be generally described as tropical and hot. Most \nof the southeast, east, and northern parts of the country comprise the dry zone, which receives \nlittle rainfall concentrated during the short winter monsoon. Economic activity in this region is \ngenerally linked to the nature of this ecological zone. A large proportion of the active labor force \nis employed in agriculture; livestock farming; fisheries; and, in urban areas, in the Government \nsectors. Economic development in major urban settlements in the region has been heavily \ninfluenced by the country\u2019s general economic growth and ability to maintain peace.5 Population \nmigration and movement remains complex, but in general all towns, and in particular Vavuniya, \nMannar,  and  Puttalam  have  played  a  critical  role  in  accommodating  internally  displaced \n                                                 \n1  Sri Lanka\u2019s economy registered annual growth of 7.7% in 2006 and 6.7% in 2007. Growth forecasts in the \nimmediate future may be moderate as a result of conflict, global price increases, and reduced structural reform. \n2  Department  of  Census  and  Statistics  2008.  Poverty  Indicators\u2013Household  Income  and  Expenditure  Survey \n2006/07. Colombo. \n3  National Council for Economic Development. 2005. Sri Lanka New Development Strategy. Colombo   \n4  In 2005, foreign employment constituted 15.01% of total employment (available: http://www.statistics.gov.lk/).  \n5  In Vavuniya and Mannar, in particular, opportunities have been restricted by limited accessibility to the fields or the \nsea, economic embargoes, transport difficulties, security restrictions, and breakdown of the market system. \nDestruction of physical infrastructure has jeopardized opportunities for economic growth.   \n ", "2 \npopulations, many of which have settled over time.6 Residents of this region experience income \nand nonincome poverty. Using the country\u2019s official poverty line, the resulting poverty headcount \nratio in major towns in the dry zone ranges from 27.0% to 45.9%,7 significantly above the \nnational  average.  The  cycle  of  poor  water  and  sanitation,  ill  health,  and  high  health-care \nexpenditure predominantly affects the poorest segments of the population; health shocks and \nchronic illness are major causes of impoverishment. Poverty is a multidimensional process and, \nin the case of the northern regions, is also related to extended instability and conflict. In \nVavuniya and Mannar, but to a lesser degree in Puttalam, years of civil war have resulted in \nextended depravation; increasing human poverty; repeated displacement;8 and a community \ncharacterized  by  a  high  number  of  refugees,  widows,  orphans,  and  disabled  people. 9 \nUnemployment is high in Puttalam and Chilaw; reportedly a consequence of limited investment. \nIn addition to an unsettled political situation, lack of basic infrastructure and services reduces \neconomic opportunities and impedes the development of these towns into vibrant regional hubs.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n4.  A  problem  and  constraints  analysis  is  in  Appendix  2,  an  analysis  of  the  sector  in \nAppendix 3, and a chronology of preparatory activities is in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n5.  Water Resource Management. Sri Lanka\u2019s dry zone is generally characterized by low \nprecipitation. The arid northwest and southeast coasts receive the least amount of rain: 600\u2013\n1,200  mm  per  year.  Water  resources,  whether  in  the  form  of  (mostly  perennial)  rivers  or \ngroundwater, are scarce. Vavuniya district dotted landscape, the only one of the three districts \nnot in the northwestern coastal belt, is characterized by a multitude of water tanks (often \ncascading), constructed since ancient times to capture perennial waters from the catchments. \nThis pattern, although less discernible, has been extensively used in inland areas of Mannar \nand Puttalam districts. However the reservoirs are often in poor state, breached, or utilized at \nsuboptimal levels. Multiple uncoordinated competing uses and users operating in isolation have \nexacerbated the situation. The use of groundwater resources has intensified, as reflected in a \nsignificant increase in water pumps and agrowells.10 The aquifer is fragile and at risk; the \nsituation is deteriorating as uncontrolled extraction intensifies.11    \n \n6.  Increasing overextraction of groundwater, resulting from population and development \npressures, and the use of water resources for multiple competing uses has led to fast depletion \nof the aquifer and salinity intrusion. To ensure efficient, equitable, and sustainable water use \nand to reduce poverty and improve well-being of the community, irrigation and water resource \npolicies need to consider all uses and users within a water system. 12 Policies and development \nstrategies  need  to  consider  long-term  impacts  of  water as  a shared  resource.  Addressing \nthreats to the water resource base in the dry zone requires an integrated, cross-sectoral, and \nmultidisciplinary institutional framework that operates regionally and locally. Countrywide, the \n                                                 \n6  Despite a small reduction in the population after 2002 (coinciding with the ceasefire agreement), statistics drawn \nfor 2002\u20132006 showed average annual growth of 3.95% for the Vavuniya urban center and 1.5% for Mannar \ndivision. Both are above the annual average growth of 1.14%. \n7  A socioeconomic survey (ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for Preparing the \nSmall Towns and Rural Arid Areas Water Supply and Sanitation Project. Manila.) identified the following household \npoverty: 45.9% in Puttalam, 43.9% in Mannar, 33% in Chilaw, and 27.7% in Vavuniya.  \n8  In Vavuniya, district planning secretariat data reveal that, of 17,000 families, almost 7,000 are displaced and 7,000 \nare resettled. In Mannar, estimates for internally displaced persons account for 20% to 30% of the population.  \n9  In Vavuniya, data (2005) indicate the conflict directly resulted in 2,777 widows, 217 orphans, and 900 disabled.  \n10  International Water Management Institute. 2007. Water Policy Briefing, Issued 14: Planning Groundwater Use for \nSustainable Rural Development. Colombo. \n11  Salinity intrusion is reportedly affecting existing groundwater extraction schemes in Puttalam and Chilaw.  \n12  Governments and development partners have extensively supported the development of groundwater resources by \nthe community. While some local studies have been conducted, regional impacts are rarely investigated. ", "    3 \nneed to implement a comprehensive integrated water resource management program,13 and \nestablish regional water resource councils and river basin management organizations to ensure \nthe availability and use of adequate quantity and quality of water is recognized.14,15 However, \nother than for major rivers, none of these activies have been implemented \n \n7.  Water  Infrastructure:  Coverage  and  Service.  The  National  Water  Supply  and \nDrainage Board (NWSDB) operates urban water supply schemes in all major towns in the \nnorthern dry zone region. In all instances, schemes have been stretched beyond their design life \nresulting  in  operating  deficiencies.  Investment  for  improvement  and  expansion  is  urgently \nneeded. Coverage is limited to a reduced number of beneficiaries,16 the schemes run at a small \nfraction of their design capacity,17 nonrevenue water (NRW) is significant18 and service does not \nmeet required standards. In Vavuniya and Mannar, water is supplied daily for an average of  \n2\u20133 hours; in Puttalam, supply is on a zonal basis for an average of 6 hours; while in Chilaw the \naverage is 4-5 hours.19 All of the schemes, except for Mannar, are subject to water quality \nconstraints  arising  from  high  iron,  manganese,  salinity,  and  pH  (Puttalam,  Chilaw),  and \nhardness (Vavuniya) in groundwater.  \n \n8.  Where piped drinking water is not available, water is generally sourced from private or \npublic dug or tube wells, public tanks, ponds, and channels;20 however the quality of extracted \nwater is often compromised and seldom verified. In addition to limited access, water supplies \nare usually insufficient, particularly at the end of the dry season. Demand and willingness to pay \nfor water and sanitation are nonetheless high, particularly in Vavuniya, Mannar, and Puttlam. \nTotal  water  demand  in  target  towns  in  2030  (including  supply  for  domestic,  institutional, \ncommercial, and industrial purposes) is estimated at around 87,000 cubic meters per day, for a \nprojected  population  of  about  420,000.  Potential  new  groundwater  sources  have  been \ninvestigated for the four towns, but currently only the Murunkan subbasin is considered to be \nable to sustainably provide supplementary drinking water to Mannar. To fulfill current and future \ndemand, surface water will be used to supplement existing sources.21  \n                                                 \n13  This should consider seasonal, regional, and demographic issues and the existence of competing users. \n14  Promoting basin planning must recognize the interconnectedness of social, economic, and environmental factors. \nAny such initiative must consider that the management of water, land, and biotic resources is interrelated. \n15  Although mandated through its act, the Water Resources Board has not been able to implement its regulatory \nfunctions. The establishment of working committees, informed by local and provincial agencies, to coordinate, plan, \nand monitor would provide foundations for a realistic and long-term strategy for water resource management. \n16 The number of connections per town is low: 738 in Vavuniya (10% of the population), 3,213 in Mannar (47%), \n7,882 in Puttalam (72%) and 5,034 in Chilaw (49%). \n17  Puttalam\u2019s scheme is reportedly operating at around 98% of its capacity, but the figures are much lower for Chilaw \n(approximately 58%), Vavuniya (approximately 67%, variations are mostly due to restrictions during the dry \nseason), and Mannar (approximately 65%; actual extraction cannot be given for Mannar, as no flow rates have \nbeen recorded, nonetheless one of the four wells is currently not operating).  \n18  NRW in all project towns is estimated. In Vavuniya and Mannar, due to the absence of bulk flow meters; and in \nPuttalam and Chilaw, due to poor functioning; NRW average estimates are 33% for Chilaw, 26% for Puttalam,  \n5%\u201334% for Vavuniya, and 9%\u201321% for Mannar. These values are expected to represent a fraction of the losses \ndue to inadequate measurement and failure to account for all components of NRW (apparent and real losses).  \n19  In all instances, water pressure is below the recommended 7 meters at the consumer outlet.  \n20  In Vavuniya, only about 4% of the existing urban households have access to the service, while the service \ncoverage is only 30% in Chilaw, 50% in Puttalam, and 48% in Mannar. According to survey data, the percentage of \nhouseholds with toilets is 85.0% in Vavuniya, 90.8% in Mannar, 78.0% in Puttalam, and 88.0% in Chilaw, which is \ngenerally in line with the national average. \n21  In Chilaw, groundwater is to be supplemented with surface water from the Dedru Oya; in Puttalam, groundwater \nresources with water from the Kala Oya river; in Vavuniya, water is to be sourced from the Per Aru perennial river.    \n ", "4 \n9.  Integrated Water and Sanitation. Conventional piped sewerage has been constructed \nin only a few areas of Sri Lanka.22 The majority of households in the project area dispose of \ntheir wastewater through a combined system consisting of (i) common sanitation technology, \ntypically pour-flush toilets connected to either a septic tank (larger or institutional buildings) or \ndirectly into a soakage pit (most households),23 and (ii) a crisscross of storm-water drains often \nutilized in most densely populated areas to discharge grey and kitchen water. Groundwater \nresources, particularly around densely populated areas, are at risk of bacterial contamination24 \ncaused by effluent leakage and pollutant migration from poorly maintained pit latrines, septic \ntanks, and other disposal facilities.25 As water supply augmentation is considered in emerging \nregional centers, wastewater and septage management must be addressed as part of the \nsolution. Based on appropriate technology, affordability and financial viability, and health and \nenvironmental principles, solutions have been found to match the needs of the various centers. \nSanitation also involves changing attitudes and behavior (especially hygiene habits), developing \nsolutions, and creating a demand for sanitation to ensure that systems are effective. \n \n10.  Sector Performance (Appendix 3). Laws relating to the distribution and use of water in \nSri Lanka are largely based on water rights rather than ownership of the water resource base. \nAlthough  water  supply  and  sanitation  policies  have  been  drafted,  their  approval  remains \npending. Main problems faced by the sector in the delivery of water and sanitation are low self-\nfinancing ratios, insufficient tariff recovery, and high production costs. NWSDB, consistent with \nits corporate strategy,26 is focusing efforts on improving its operating and financial performance. \nSpecific actions include the development of a new tariff methodology to meet revised cost-\nrecovery objectives, recent introduction of a sewerage tariff, and quarterly monitoring of financial \nindicators. In parallel, progress has been achieved by programs to reduce power consumption \nand strengthen financial management, but performance in the area of reducing nonrevenue \nwater remains inadequate and generally underfunded. Moreover, in recent years, NWSDB has \ninitiated several policy reforms aimed at improving institutional efficiency and decentralizing \nplanning and management. NWSDB\u2019s vision, as formulated in its corporate plan, specifically \nproposes (i) decentralizing financial and administrative authority in a first stage, to be followed \nby additional responsibilities; and (ii) transforming regional support centers 27 into small business \nunits with greater autonomy and accountability. The plan recognizes the need to strengthen the \ncapacity  of  regional  support  centers  and  regional  offices  to  provide  more  efficient  and \nresponsive service delivery. Areas for development include asset management, asset planning, \nand public utility management. \n \n11.  Regional financial and operating performance varies. The office functions of Puttalam, \nVavuniya, and Mannar are limited to operation and maintenance (O&M) of urban and periurban \n                                                 \n22  In Vavuniya, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) approved the construction of wastewater treatment \nfacilities for the hospital. Chilaw\u2019s District General Hospital collects its wastewater in two underground chambers \nand pumps the wastewater about 750 m to a small pond system, which drains its effluent directly into the lagoon. \n23  Soils in the coastal area are usually silty sand with limited permeability, whereas those in Vavuniya are mostly silty \nand/or sandy soils overlying weathered rock. While the efficiency of existing sanitation methods varies between the \ncoastal belt and inland, they all encounter problems during the rainy season, when the water table is higher.  \n24  Most latrines are either pour-flush or water-sealed toilets, with less than 2% of the population using open pit \nlatrines. More than 65% of the latrines are connected to ground pits, with associated risks of seepage and \ncontamination of surrounding areas, and when connected to septic tanks, these are seldom emptied. \n25  In high-density environments, the construction, operation, and maintenance of septic tanks is often inadequate, as \nsoils are highly pervious and pollutants can easily migrate. This is exacerbated by suboptimal service. \n26  National Water Supply and Drainage Board. 2002. NWSDB Corporate Strategy. Colombo; and National Water \nSupply and Drainage Board. 2007. NWSDB Corporate Strategy (2007\u20132011). Colombo. \n27  To  increase  performance,  NWSDB  is  revising  its  internal  structure.  As  part  of  the  proposed  activities  the \nestablishment of 11 regional support centers (one per province, Greater Colombo, and headquarters) is soon to be \nconfirmed. ADB. 2008. Institutional Strengthening for Decentralized Service Delivery in the Water Sector. Manila. ", "    5 \nwater schemes. The financial position of Puttalam\u2019s scheme was strengthened during 2004\u2013\n2006, with net profits of about 13% for 2005 and 2006. Chilaw is characterized by technical \ninefficiencies. In Vavuniya and Mannar, where schemes were established in the 1940s and no \nsignificant investments have taken place for several decades, a comprehensive improvement \nplan will accompany infrastructure development. In all instances, specific measures are needed \nto reduce nonrevenue water, improve accounting, introduce billing and collection functions and \nhuman resource development, improve O&M, and strengthen planning capacity. Inefficiencies \ncan be redressed as part of project implementation through (i) an agreed framework prior to \nproject  approval,  (ii)  implementation  of  an  institutional  development  program,  and  \n(iii) implementation of decentralized service delivery functions. \n \n12.  External Assistance and Coordination. In recent years, the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) and the Government of Japan have been major development partners in the water supply \nand sanitation sector. In rural areas, both the Ministry of Urban Development and NWSDB, with \nsupport from the World Bank and ADB, have promoted community participation in water and \nsanitation for more than a decade. Other development partners include the Government of \nDenmark (engaged in small towns in Central Province and Colombo), Government of Japan \n(supporting  large  programs  in  Kandy,  Colombo,  and  towns  around  Colombo;  and  smaller \ninitiatives in the Central Region), and the governments of France and Germany. ADB\u2019s water \nand sanitation sector strategy (i) aims to improve service coverage, enhance cost recovery, and \npromote  self-financing  capacity  of  sector  agencies;  and  (ii)  has  consistently  focused  on \nsecondary urban centers and the concomitant need for local strengthening. External assistance \nis outlined in Appendix 4.28 \n \n13.  Project  Strategy.  Lessons  from  experience  in  the  sector  highlight  the  need  to  \n(i) incorporate greater consultation, participatory processes, and local government involvement \ninto project implementation; (ii) avoid conflicts with other water users and secure adequate \nrights to access the water source; (iii) conduct adequate costing and contingencies, minimizing \ninaccuracies in cost estimates that may lead to significant cost overruns; (iv) implement regular \nwater tariff increases, with adequate tariff objectives; (v) ensure that sanitation improvements \nare an integral part of any water development project; (vi) secure sustainable water resource \ndevelopment, and establish frameworks for water resource management; and (vii) develop \ncapacity, targeting all levels of influence. Based on this experience and in support of the \nGovernment\u2019s strategies in the sector, the Project will seek to (i) improve service provision by \ndecentralizing functions to the district offices and increasing operating efficiency, (ii) promote an \nintegrated water and sanitation approach to establish partnerships with local governments, (iii) \npromote integrated water resource management principles, and (iv) secure improved financial \nmanagement of implementing authorities (Appendix 5 and Supplementary Appendix B). \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n14.  The expected impact of the Project is improved physical well-being of urban populations \nin Sri Lanka\u2019s northwestern dry zone. The expected outcome is improved urban water and \n                                                 \n28  Specifically to the project area, Puttlam town and Chilaw town water supply schemes were rehabilitated and \nexpanded with assistance from the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China in the early 1990s. Small \ninterventions in recent years include United Nations Children\u2019s Fund support for construction of a new piped \nscheme mainly focusing in resettlement areas at Manathiuv grama niladhari division. Vavuniya\u2019s water scheme \nwas established in 1940, and improved and partially expanded in 1992 with support from German development \ncooperation  (10%  coverage);  while  German  development  cooperation  and  ADB  supported  the  partial \nreconstruction of some of Mannar\u2019s water scheme units that were heavily damaged by conflict. \n ", "6 \nsanitation  services  and  management  in  the  northwestern  dry  zone.  The  Project  will  \n(i) improve and expand infrastructure and services, (ii) strengthen institutions for better service \ndelivery  and  water  resource  management,  and  (iii)  build  project  management  and \nimplementation capacity.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n15.  The  Project  has  three  parts.  Component  1  covers  rehabilitation,  expansion,  and \ndevelopment of water and sanitation infrastructure for northwestern dry zone towns including  \n(i) urban and periurban water supply, and (ii) septage management and sanitation. Component \n2 will provide the foundations to (i) support decentralization of service delivery functions to \nregional offices; (ii) improve water resource management, coordination, and planning ability; \nand (iii) increase public awareness. Component 3 will strengthen implementation. \n \n1.  Component 1: Developing Water and Sanitation Infrastructure \na.  Improved Water Supply Service and Coverage \n16.  Water supply in the towns of Vavuniya, Mannar, Puttalam, and Chilaw is deficient and \ngroundwater  resources  already  exploited  by  households  are  insufficient.  Groundwater  (at \nsustainable extraction rates) required to meet population needs can only be secured in Mannar; \ntherefore, additional water must be obtained from surface sources in the remaining towns. This \ncomponent will finance infrastructure to abstract, treat, and distribute a total of 61,500 cubic \nmeters of water per day. The Project will support water resource development;29 rehabilitation, \nand  construction  of  new  treatment  facilities;30 and  storage,  transmission,  and  distribution \nsystems.31 In addition to expanding distribution to new areas, including periurban areas along \nthe  transmission  mains,  the  Project  will  implement  a  comprehensive  nonrevenue  water \nreduction program32 that includes replacing or installing new bulk water meters and a leak \ndetection program for rehabilitation and strengthening of the existing distribution network. \n \n17.  The investments will (i) improve service delivery, and (ii) expand services to underserved \nareas.  Improvements  in  service  delivery  will  focus  on  providing  better  water  quality  and \nlengthening water supply service duration to 24 hours, 7 days a week in all four project towns at \nan adequate water pressure.33 The Project also aims to provide full coverage for residents in the \nproject areas.34 For this purpose, NWSDB will (i) provide within 1 year of project completion, \n                                                 \n29  The Project will finance (i) 15,000 cubic meters (m3)/day intake on the Deduru Oya river and construction of seven \nreplacement wells and pump systems in Chilaw; (ii) 15,000 m3/day intake on the Kala Oya river and rehabilitation \nand/or restoration of Elawankulama and Achchamolai tanks in Puttalam; (iii) development of a new tank on the Per \nAru river, a 12,000 m3/day intake and construction of four wells and pump systems in Vavuniya; and (iv) flushing \nand development of four existing Murunkan boreholes and construction of four new boreholes in Mannar.  \n30  This will include rehabilitation of existing treatment facilities in Chilaw and Puttalam to increase plant efficiency as \nwell as enable meeting required standards (regarding the removal of precipitated iron) by introducing modifications \nto existing aerators, filters, and sludge removal facilities. In addition, new conventional treatment works will be \ndeveloped in Chilaw, Puttalam, and Vavuniya to treat a total of 30 megaliters per day; disinfection facilities \n(chlorination) will be provided in Mannar. \n31  This includes an estimated total of 122 km of transmission mains, 464 km of distribution lines, and 12 storage \nreservoirs (towers or sumps) for all four project towns.   \n32  The NRW program will conduct a full diagnosis, including unbilled authorized consumption and water losses, \nwhether these are (i) apparent losses (unauthorized consumption and metering inaccuracies); or (ii) real losses \n(leakage on transmission and/or distribution mains, leakage and overflows at utility storage tanks, and leakage on \nservice connections up to customer's meters). \n33  In compliance with NWSDB. 2007. Primer on NWSDB\u2019s Responsibilities, Standards, and KPIs. Colombo, pressure \nwill be at a minimum of 7 meters and a maximum of 40 meters at the consumer outlets for all areas connected.   \n34  This will amount to approximately 200,000 people by project completion and 420,000 by 2030. ", "    7 \nconnections to all households that have placed requests; and (ii) ensure that all standposts are \nconverted into metered community connections with clearly identified users.35 \n \nb.  Improved Sanitation and Septage Management \n18.  Addressing sanitation and wastewater management in urban settlements is essential, \nparticularly as water supply will be augmented. The Project considers this integrated approach \nand proposes adopting efficient sanitation solutions that adequately match project areas.36 This \nsubcomponent  will  promote  improvements  in  sanitation37 and  septage  management  and \ndisposal systems in all four project towns.38 Sanitation improvements are designed as modestly \nsized components having considered (i) population density, (ii) sufficient wastewater generation \nto  provide  gravity  flow,  (iii)  efficient  zoning,  (iv)  prevention  of  sewage  overflows,  and  \n(v) affordability. A fee will be introduced for this service. Sanitation systems managed by the \nurban councils are already often subject to a charge. This will be formalized under the Project. \n \n19.  The Project will conduct a low-cost sanitation program for poor communities in the form \nof household latrines in newly served periurban areas. Priority will be given to lower income \nhouseholds and those that do not own or have access to latrines; and will provide adequate \ncost-effective,  small-scale  infrastructure.  Nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  and  local \ngovernment will be engaged in mobilizing communities, delivering essential training, conducting \na technical assessment, and evaluating initial capital investment for proposed schemes.  \n \n2.  Component 2: Strengthening Water Sector Institutions \na.  Strengthening Water Resource Management, Coordination, and \nPlanning Ability \n20.  The  Project  will  support  water  resource  monitoring,  coordination,  planning,  and \nregulatory initiatives by (i) assisting the Government in preparing catchment management plans \nin project areas that will guide decisions relating to integrated water resource management and \nwater allocations; (ii) aiding local authorities in the Puttalam, Vavuniya, and Mannar districts to \n(a) prepare water extraction regulations, (b) introduce participatory monitoring systems; and \n(iii) map groundwater and users in project districts, and initiate the establishment of a central \nwater resources information center. \n \n21.  Catchment Protection and Management. The Project will support the development of \nriver basin plans in project areas, specifically for Per Aru, Kala Oya, and Deduru Oya rivers. The \nsubcomponent  will  promote  integrated  water  resource  management  principles  and  healthy \nrivers. It will consider management of multifunctional water regulation arrangements developed \nin a specific basin context; and the conservation and improvement of associated watersheds, \n                                                 \n35  Community connections, while limited, remain essential in the project context, particularly those serving internally \ndisplaced people\u2019s camps and poorer urban dwellers. Communities supplied  with water through communal \nmetered facilities will form community-based organizations that will register and sign an agreement with NWSDB. \nThe organizations will nominate representatives to coordinate and collect payments. \n36  Solutions consider O&M, monitoring and enforcement, economics and finance, and achievable standards. \n37  Based on physical and socioeconomic surveys, the Project will (i) provide new and/or improved latrines to about \n1,800 households living in periurban areas of the four project towns and due to be connected for the first time to a \npiped water system; and (ii) rehabilitate 13 public latrines. Rehabilitation of public latrines will be strictly linked to an \nagreement with local authorities to introduce an improved results-based framework for management by the private \nsector. At present, although mostly operated and maintained by the private sector, lack of monitoring and reporting \nhas led to poor maintenance and serious deterioration of the facilities.  \n38  Improved septage handling and disposal will be secured through (i) provision of truck-mounted vacuum septic tank \ncleaning machines (a total of six) for all four project towns, and (ii) development of sludge disposal facilities \n(comprising sludge thickener, anaerobic ponds, sludge drying beds, and enclosed site development). In Puttalam, \nsuitably dried and stabilized sludge will be composted with green waste. \n ", "8 \nwetlands, and ecosystems.39 The river basin plans will be prepared in a participatory manner \nand in close consultation with all concerned provincial and central government authorities. It will \nconceptualize  a  medium-term  framework  for  selected  basins,  including  institutional \narrangements  and  responsibilities,  proposed  planning  and  management  systems,  capacity-\nbuilding requirements (information management systems, human resources, strategic planning, \nand intersectoral planning), and technical and financial support needed.  \n \n22.  Safeguarding Groundwater. The Project will support local authorities in project districts \nin preparing bylaws, and implementing rules and regulations to (i) monitor and control water \nabstraction,  (ii)  prevent  groundwater  contamination  (from  agricultural  and  bacteriological \nsources),  and  (iii)  implement  measures  to  enhance  aquifer  recharge.  It  will  support  local \nauthorities introducing village participatory groundwater monitoring systems. This will entail  \n(i) raising awareness among communities, (ii) increasing local organizational capacity through \nmobilization  of  people  and  resources,  (iii)  appointing  village  regulatory  committees,  and  \n(iv) providing training for monitoring and compliance with regulations. The Project may prepare \n(i) technical information sheets to aid village committee monitoring; (ii) guidelines on mobilizing, \nappointing, and functioning of regulatory committees, and (iii) guidelines on the establishment \nand revision of performance targets and reporting mechanisms\u2014to the provincial councils and \nthe  Water  Resources  Board  (WRB)  through  local  government;  and  provide  technical  and \norganizational training. To promote partnerships, training may be conducted in collaboration \nwith specialized organizations, academic institutions, and NGOs.  \n \n23.  Water Resource Mapping. The Project will (i) support WRB\u2019s efforts to establish a \nnationwide electronic repository of water resources information,40 and (ii) support provincial \ncouncils in project areas and WRB in efforts to map data generated under the previous activity \nthrough a Geographic Information System. In addition, as part of component 1, groundwater \nquality and quantity data will be collected and analyzed for new groundwater resources in \nVavuniya and Mannar. \n \nb.  Building Capacity for Service Delivery in Project Areas \n24.  Decentralization.  The  Project  will  support  NWSDB\u2019s  transfer  of  functions  and \nresponsibilities  to  Puttalam,  Mannar,  and  Vavuniya\u2019s  regional  offices,  including  improved  \n(i)  commercial  functions  and  meter  reading,  billing,  and  collection;  (ii)  customer  service;  \n(iii) general accounting and financial reporting; (iv) fixed  asset management and planning;  \n(v)  inventory,  stores,  and  purchasing  systems;  (vi)  budget  planning  and  control;  \n(vii)  maintenance  of  water  supply  and  sewerage  facilities;  and  (viii)  human  resource \nmanagement,  administration,  and  general  services.  As  part  of  planning,  sensitization  to \ncommunity  needs  and  grievance  prevention  and  settlement  will  be  undertaken.  This \nsubcomponent will provide (i) expert support to introduce a robust time-bound program to \nenable decentralization in project areas,41 and (ii) a training program to enhance the capacity of \n                                                 \n39  The plans will build on existing investigations and studies (such as Kala Oya\u2019s ecological study) and new data \nrelating to socioeconomic activities in the basin, ecological resources, water quality, and hydrological data. \n40  This  may  include,  WRB\u2019s  data  on  (i)  Vavuniya  and  Puttalam  districts\u2019  groundwater  monitoring  program,  \n(ii) groundwater assessment study in Deduru Oya\u2019s Basin, and (iii) Japan International Cooperation Agency-\nsupported tube well program in Mannar.  \n41  This will include (i) development of a time-bound 5-year institutional building plan (which will include preparation of \nan operating action plan and business plan); (ii) establishment of district offices (including the development and \nimplementation of a suitable organization structure and staffing requirements, functional charts, and a staffing \norganization); (iii) strengthening of financial management functions; (iv) establishment of commercial functions and \nimprovement of customer relations (through the establishment of relevant centers); (v) strengthening of technical \nexpertise on project planning, design, and O&M (include setting up testing laboratories in Puttalam and Vavuniya; ", "    9 \nstaff  in  NWSDB  local  offices.42 The  Project  will  support  upgrading  of  NWSDB  offices  in \nVavuniya and of information technology facilities to increase efficiency and ensure readiness to \nundertake regional support center functions in Northern Province. All training proposals will \nneed to be linked to a specific and measurable outcome to be delivered by NWSDB. \n \n25.  Local Government Design and Monitoring Capacity. The Project will conduct a series \nof trainings for local authorities in project towns to enhance (i) management capacity (public \nlatrines and septage systems), and (ii) on-site sanitation planning and enforcement. The Project \nwill review, update, and print copies of a revised on-site sanitation manual (or prepare a second \nvolume) that will address (i) soil testing and its impact on system design, (ii) key aspects to be \nconsidered  for  adequate  supervision  of  construction,  and  (iii)  adequate  siting  of  pits  and \nsoakage and/or infiltration fields. The Project will formulate manuals and provide technical \ncapacity  to  local  authorities  for  preparing  and  monitoring  performance-based  management \ncontracts with private sector operators responsible for public latrine maintenance.  \n \nc.  Increasing Water Conservation and Environmental Awareness  \n26.  This subcomponent focuses on changing attitudes and misconceptions. Building on \nexisting  experience,  the  Project  will  conduct  a  water  environmental  awareness  program \nfocusing  on  (i)  water  conservation,  (ii)  hygiene  and  sanitation,  and  (iii)  cost-recovery  for \nimproved  service  delivery.  The  outreach  program  will  increase  understanding  of  district \nresidents, technical staff, community leaders, and decision-makers on specific issues affecting \ndry zones. Community leaders will be invited to actively participate in the awareness campaign, \nutilizing  multiple  means  of  communication.43 If  practical,  an  NGO  may  help  design  and \nimplement the awareness program. \n   \n3.  Component 3: Building Management and Implementation Capacity \n27.  This subcomponent will cover incremental administration costs and counterpart staff of \nNWSDB, urban councils, and the Irrigation Department. It will include preliminary investigations \nand consulting services to assist project implementation staff in (i) designing and supervising \nconstruction of water and sanitation infrastructure; (ii) formulating and delivering the public \nawareness campaign; and (iii) providing selective training, and safeguards compliance.   \n \nC.  Special Features \n28.  Water and Environmental Protection. The Project aims to protect public health from \npotential waterborne contamination, and reduce the overall demands on the fragile aquifer. It \nwill  help  protect  water  resources  from  overextraction  and  contamination  by  upgrading \ninfrastructure  and  improving  water  planning  and  coordination  elements.  By  supporting  a \ncomprehensive  water  and  environmental  monitoring  program,  the  Project  will  provide \nmechanisms to evaluate changes resulting from extraction, reflecting impacts from climate \nchange and major shifts in social, environmental, and economic patterns associated with it.  \n \n                                                                                                                                                          \ngroundwater investigation facilities in Vavuniya); and (vi) implementation of a comprehensive NRW reduction study \nin Vavuniya, Mannar, and Puttalam districts. \n42  This  will include (i) development of appropriate systems and procedures (general accounting and financial \nreporting systems, financial planning and budgeting, billing and collection, fixed assets, inventory management, \nconstruction management and disbursements); and (ii) provision of training to match these requirements. \n43  The campaign will focus on (i) causes and consequences of groundwater depletion and pollution, and impact on \nhealth and livelihoods; (ii) options for community-based water resource management, protection, and conservation; \n(iii) water resources and sewage; and (iv) operating costs and need for service, water and sewage tariffs. \n ", "10 \n29.  Managing  for  Results:  Improving  Utility  Performance.  The  Project  proposes  an \napproach aiming to carefully monitor (and enhance) performance. Activities are structured to \ndemonstrate significant improvements including (i) operating performance; (ii) human resource \nbase and human resource management of NWSDB business units; (iii) financial management; \nand (iv) nonrevenue water reduction. \n \n30.  Support for the Reconciliation Process. The Project constitutes a unique opportunity \nto  support  the  reconciliation  process.  It  will  bring  communities  together  and  assist  in \nrehabilitating, reconstructing, and developing areas affected by decades of conflict. The Project \nincorporates, in its design, opportunities to enhance participation of the local community in \ndecision-making and aims to build local capacity. Moreover, it has identified grievance and \ndispute prevention and settlement mechanisms to minimize tensions between communities. \nSupplementary Appendix C provides details of the program. \n \nD.

Financing Plan \n32.  The  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $59,780,000  equivalent  and  a  grant  of \n$23,220,000 from the Asian Development Fund (ADF) to help finance the Project. The loan will \nhave a 32-term including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1% per year during the \ngrace period and 1.5% during the amortization. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the \nreasons for its decision to borrow from the ADF on the basis of these terms and conditions, and \n(ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in \nreliance  on  any  communication  or  advice  from  ADB.  The  grant  will  finance  septage \nimprovements,  community  and  pro-poor  sanitation  facilities,  capacity  building  for  service ", "    11 \ndelivery,  project  implementation  capacity  and  administration  support,  and  water  resource \ndevelopment. The Netherlands Trust Fund for the Water Financing Partnership Facility will \nprovide grant cofinancing equivalent to $2,000,000 for activities under subcomponents 2 a and c \n(including  activities  for  strengthening  water  resource  management,  and  coordination  and \nplanning ability; and increasing public awareness). It includes consultancies under package C, \nstudies, surveys, materials, and services relating to the public awareness campaign. The loan \nand grant will cover 75% of the total project cost. This is in agreement with local cost financing \npercentage limits for the country. The Government will provide $28,330,000 equivalent to cover \n(i) taxes and duties, (ii) land acquisition and compensation costs, (iii) incremental recurrent \nGovernment staff costs, (iv) interagency payments, and (v) a small fraction of civil works costs. \nThe financing plan is summarized in Table 2. The Government has assured that counterpart \nfinancing for the Project will be available. \n \n33.  The Government will provide the loan proceeds to NWSDB as a blend of Government \ngrant and Government loan, denominated in local currency. The Government will bear the \nforeign exchange risk. The ratio of Government grant and loan was determined based on urban \nand rural population ratios in project areas. Lending arrangements between the Government \nand NWSDB involve funding for (i) water supply schemes in areas under the pradeshiya sabhas \nas 85% grant and 15% loan; (ii) water supply in areas under the urban and municipal councils \nas 50% grant and 50% loan; and (iii) 100% grant for septage treatment schemes. In each case, \nGovernment loan financing will be at the rate of 10% per annum with a repayment and grace \nperiods of 25 years and 5 years. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Total    Percent \nAsian Development Bank  83.00    73.2 \n  Asian Development Fund Grant   23.22    20.5 \n  Asian Development Fund Loan  59.78    52.7 \nNetherlands Trust Fund for the Water Financing Partnership Facility   2.00    1.8 \nGovernment  28.33    25.0 \n    Total         113.33    100.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n34.  NWSDB,  under  the  Ministry  of  Water  Supply  and  Drainage,  will  be  the  Executing \nAgency.  Central  and  provincial  irrigation  departments  will  be  tasked  with  implementing \nrehabilitation  and  improvement  works  for  Elawankulama  and  Achchamolai  reservoirs,  and \nconstruction of a new reservoir on Per Aru,. NWSDB, in close coordination with urban councils \nin project towns, will be charged with implementing the sanitation improvement subcomponent. \nA small project coordination cell (PCC),44 to be established within NWSDB\u2019s head office, will \nhave  a  monitoring,  coordination,  and  supervisory  role.  The  bulk  of  the  activities  will  be \nimplemented by existing NWSDB regional offices that will be duly strengthened. Vavuniya \nregional  office  will  be  responsible  for  water  supply  and  sanitation  development  works  in \n                                                 \n44  The PCC will be accountable for (i) coordinating policy-related activities and ensuring that PICC meetings are \nconducted quarterly, (ii) preparing the overall project implementation plan and consolidated annual work plan,  \n(iii)  coordinating  training  programs  and  annual  allocations  for  each  of  the  regional  offices,  (iv)  conducting \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  activities  to  ensure  compliance  with  loan  covenants  and  agreed  targets,  \n(v) implementing project performance management system surveys, (vi) project accounting and disbursement in \naccordance with ADB guidelines, and (vii) coordinating the preparation and submission to ADB of quarterly reports. \n ", "12 \nVavuniya  and  Mannar.  Puttalam  regional  office  will  be  responsible  for  water  supply  and \nsanitation development works in Puttalam and Chilaw. Urban councils will work with regional \noffices in the design, evaluation, construction, and overall implementation activities relating to \nsanitation and septage improvement. Staffing requirements for the Project will consider both \nincremental staff for implementation and construction phases, and long-term O&M; particularly \nconsidering functions required to successfully run the NWSDB north office. The Government \nhas agreed to provide adequate staff for implementation, which should be acceptable to ADB; \nthe associated costs will constitute part of their contribution to the Project. A national project \nimplementation coordination committee (PICC) will be established to oversee the Project, and \ncomprise senior representatives from central and provincial government agencies. The PICC, \nchaired by the Ministry of Water Supply and Drainage secretary, will advise and guide the \nProject on national strategic and policy decisions. The PICC will hold its first meeting within  \n3 months of loan and grant effectiveness, and meet at least quarterly, or as often as necessary. \nProvincial project coordination committees will be established in Northern and North Western \nprovinces to provide provincial coordination and oversee progress in urban sanitation, tank \nrehabilitation, and water resource management activities. The committees will meet whenever \nnecessary, but not less than quarterly. A flow chart of the structure is included in Appendix 8. \nDetailed designs will be endorsed by local stakeholder committees. \n \n35.  Experienced project managers will be appointed to head project sections within the \nregional offices, subject to concurrence from both the External Resources Department and \nADB.45,46 NWSDB will also appoint a focal point to the PCC,47 to regularly communicate with \nADB and the project managers. A core team of NWSDB employees will assist the two project \nmanagers,  and  include  specialists  in  water  supply,  sewerage  and  sanitation,  procurement, \nenvironment, finance and accounting, and social and community development. They will be \nsupported as appropriate by a project design, supervision, and management consulting team. \nSupplementary Appendix E outlines the terms of reference for implementing agencies. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n36.  The Project will be implemented in 4.5 years and is expected to end in December 2013. \nStart-up  activities  will  include  establishing  the  PICC  and  provincial  project  coordination \ncommittees, recruiting project staff and consultants, conducting comprehensive investigations \nand surveys, and procuring equipment immediately required. Implementation will commence \napproximately 12 months after loan and grant effectiveness; physical works might start in the \nfirst  quarter  of  2010  after  obtaining  required  environmental  clearances  from  central  and \nprovincial environmental agencies, water extraction rights,48 and completing land acquisition. \nThe project implementation schedule is in Appendix 9. \n                                                 \n45 The regional offices will be responsible for (i) recruiting consultants and NGOs jointly with the PCC; (ii) assisting the \nirrigation departments and urban councils to implement their respective activities; (iii) carrying out detailed surveys, \ninvestigations, and engineering designs of their investment activities prior to starting any tendering process; (iv) \nconducting all aspects of the procurement process; (v) ensuring compliance with loan and grant covenants; (vi) \ncoordinating with the PCC on disbursement-related matters; (vii) maintaining project documents and submitting \nreports on time, including audit reports, to the PCC; (viii) collecting data for key indicators; (ix) supervising \nimplementation of summary poverty reduction and social strategy activities (including gender-related programs); (x) \nobtaining all necessary clearances; and (xi) organizing provincial project coordination committee meetings. \n46  They will be responsible to deputy general managers in their respective regional support centers, under the clear \nunderstanding that, in a matrix-based management approach, their performance will be benchmarked against \nresponsiveness to the PCC in meeting project-specific requirements. \n47  The PCC focal point will report to the additional general manager (water supply), who in turn will closely coordinate \nwith the additional general manager (north and central).  \n48  This pertains to agencies mandated under Sri Lanka law for the administration and management of water \nresources and may include central and provincial irrigation departments, and Agrarian Services Department. The ", "    13 \n3.  Procurement \n37.  Civil  Works  and  Goods. The bulk of procurement activities will be carried out by \nNWSDB\u2019s regional offices; while central and provincial irrigation departments, supported by the \nproject implementation consultants, will take responsibility for procurement activities relating to \ntank rehabilitation and construction. Procurement of water supply and septage schemes will \nfollow procedures for international competitive bidding and national competitive bidding. Goods \nand related services, and civil works to be financed from loan proceeds will be procured in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Civil \nworks  contracts  valued  over  $3.0  million  equivalent  and  equipment  contracts  valued  over \n$500,000 equivalent will be undertaken through international competitive bidding procedures, \nwhile civil works contracts valued at $3.0 million equivalent or less and equipment packages \nvalued at $500,000 equivalent or less will be procured following national competitive bidding \nprocedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Packages  valued  at  $100,000  equivalent  or  less  will  be \nprocured under shopping procedures. The proposed procurement plan is in Supplementary \nAppendix F and its summary is in Appendix 10. \n \n38.  Advance Action and Retroactive Financing. Lessons from ADB-assisted water supply \nand sanitation projects in Sri Lanka indicate the need to address start-up delays and slow \ndisbursements in initial years brought about by delays in (i) consultant selection, and (ii) time \ntaken to complete preparatory work before contract award. To expedite project implementation, \nadvance  action  will  be  taken  for  (i)  recruiting  design  and  construction  supervision  and \nmanagement consultants; (ii) prequalifying contractors, if relevant; (iii) undertaking preliminary \ninvestigations; and (iv) initiating design activities relating to Mannar\u2019s transmission line. The \nGovernment has requested retroactive financing for expenditures incurred during the 12 months \nprior to loan effectiveness and relating to conducting topographical surveys, and geotechnical \nand groundwater investigations. The Government has been advised that approval of advance \naction and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance all or any part of the Project. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n39.  An estimated 871 person-months (86 international, 785 national) of consulting services \nare  needed.  Consulting  services  are  required  to  (i)  facilitate  project  implementation  and \nmanagement; and (ii) strengthen institutional, administrative, and financial capacities of the \nregional offices. NWSDB will recruit two firms in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof  Consultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  to  support  the  Project  and  include  \n(i) package A, design and construction supervision support; and (ii) package B, institutional \ndevelopment.  Package  A  will  include  60  person-months  of  international  expertise  and  \n588 person-months of national expertise. In addition, about 788 person-months of technical and \nsupport staff will be provided under package A for implementation of the Project. Package B will \ninclude 11 person-months of international expertise and 79 person-months of national expertise; \nwhile package C, for water resource management financed by the Netherlands Trust Fund for \nthe Water Financing Partnership Facility, will cover 15 person-months of international expertise \nand  118  person-months  of  national  expertise.  The  proposed  terms  of  reference  are  in \nSupplementary Appendixes H, I, and J. NWSDB will engage all consulting firms using the \nquality- and cost-based selection method with a standard quality-cost ratio of 80:20. NGOs will \nbe  recruited  to  support  public  awareness  and  community  mobilization  activities.  Services \nrequired to conduct topographical surveys and groundwater investigations under advance action \nwill be recruited following the least cost selection and will not exceed $100,000. \n \n                                                                                                                                                          \nagreements are generally in the form of a memorandum of understanding and should include adequate methods of \narbitration acceptable to these agencies, NWSDB, and farmers utilizing water for cultivation. \n ", "14 \n5.  Anticorruption Policy  \n40.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government, Ministry of Water Supply and Drainage, and NWSDB. Consistent with its \ncommitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to \ninvestigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive \npractices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy are included in the loan and grant regulations and the bidding documents \nfor the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project shall \ninclude provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of \nthe Executing Agency and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as \nthey relate to the Project. The Project will introduce additional specific measures to enhance \n \ngovernance and prevent corruption. The measures include (i) providing consultant support to \nproject implementation staff on procurement and financial management; (ii) using information \ntechnology  to  increase  transparency,  accountability,  and  efficiency;  (iii)  implementing \nprocurement and performance audits; (iv) reviewing fiduciary issues; (v) sharing with ADB all \nrepresentation letters and attended to these within 3 weeks of receipt; and (vi) management and \nemployees adhering to codes of conduct. Specific measures adopted to enhance transparency \nunder the Project include (i) random and independent spot checks by ADB review missions on \nprocurement and project accounts; (ii) public disclosure of information through the NWSDB and \nproject website (to be prepared) on (a) bidding procedures, bidders, and contract awards for the \nProject; and (b) use of the funds disbursed under the Project; and (iii) beneficiary involvement in \nproject monitoring and evaluation. Proposed measures to enhance managerial and procurement \ncapacity include (i) during contractor  prequalification, project staff will undertake a process of \nverification  to  meet  the  specified  qualification  criteria,  making  the  results  available  on  the \nwebsite; (ii) tender capacity will be mandatory criteria for award of contracts; and (iii) strict \nNWSDB review of implementation and evaluation of the institutional strengthening component \nunder the Project to assess operating performance and financial management improvement. \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements  \n41.  Vavuniya and Puttalam regional offices will prepare disbursement projections, request \nbudgetary  allocations  for  counterpart  funds,  collect  supporting  documents,  and  prepare \nwithdrawal applications in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as \namended from time to time). The PCC will consolidate these and send them to ADB. To \nfacilitate the timely release of loan and grant proceeds and counterpart funds, and to expedite \nproject implementation, the Government will, immediately after loan and grant effectiveness, \nopen and maintain three project imprest accounts, one for each of the ADF loan and grant, and \none for the Netherlands Trust Fund for the Water Financing Partnership Facility grant, which will \nbe established with the Central Bank of Sri Lanka for NWSDB. Second-generation imprest \naccounts in Sri Lanka rupees for each of these will be established by the PCC. The total \nadvances to the imprest account, including the initial advance, will not at any time exceed \nestimated ADB-financed expenditures for the next 6 months or 10% of the respective loan or \ngrant amount, whichever is lower. To facilitate project implementation, third-generation imprest \naccounts will be established for each regional office at a commercial bank in Puttalam and \nVavuniya acceptable to ADB. The initial ceiling of the third-generation imprest accounts for each \nregional office will be $1,000,000 equivalent for each of the ADF loan and grant. The PCC and \nregional offices will ensure that all imprest accounts will be established, managed, replenished, \nand  liquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook,  and  detailed \narrangements  agreed  to  by  the  Government  and  ADB.  ADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditure \nprocedure will be used to liquidate imprest advances or reimbursement procedure for individual \nexpenditures of $100,000 or less.   ", "    15 \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n42.  The Government will provide ADB with detailed quarterly progress reports on project \nimplementation, which will follow ADB\u2019s standard procedures. Based on an agreed format, each \nof the two regional offices will prepare the reports; PCC will consolidate them and submit a \ncombined report to ADB. Within 3 months of physical completion of the Project, the PCC will be \nresponsible  for  submitting  a  project  completion  report  to  ADB  following  ADB  standard \nprocedures. The PCC will be responsible for obtaining and consolidating relevant data from the \nregional offices, which will prepare project operating accounts and financial statements, and \nrecords of the statement of expenditure. Auditors acceptable to ADB will audit the imprest \naccount, second- and third-generation imprest accounts, and statement of expenditures. The \nfinal audit report will include a separate audit opinion on each of these. The regional offices will \nagree to have their project operating accounts audited by the PCC before receiving any funding \nthrough  the  Project.  Audited  financial  statements  and  project  accounts,  together  with  the \nauditor\u2019s report, should be submitted within 6 months of the close of the financial year. The PCC \nand regional offices will have an adequate number of suitably qualified accounting staff. \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n43.  To ensure that project components are managed efficiently and benefits are maximized, \nthe PCC will establish a project performance monitoring system within 3 months of loan and \ngrant effectiveness. The project performance monitoring system, established in accordance with \nADB's Project Performance Management System Handbook, will provide a cause-and-effect \nrelationship between the Project and its impact. Project performance monitoring and evaluation \nwill be based on the design and monitoring framework and the baseline surveys specified in it. \nBeneficiaries will be involved in project monitoring evaluation through direct reporting to regional \noffices  and  through  the  provincial  project  coordination  committees.  The  indicators  to  be \nmonitored will be formulated by and agreed upon with NWSDB, including indicators pertaining \nto physical progress and institutional reform activities (such as nonrevenue water reduction). \nUnder  the  guidance  of  the  PCC,  regional  offices  will  gather  baseline  physical  and \nsocioeconomic data, and submit a detailed implementation plan for monitoring performance. \nThe  PCC  will  consolidate  these  and  submit  benchmark  information  for  ADB\u2019s  review  and \nconcurrence  within  9  months  of  loan  and  grant  effectiveness.  Thereafter,  the  PCC  will \ncoordinate with the regional offices to submit semiannual monitoring and evaluation reports to \nADB throughout project implementation, and submit a comprehensive completion survey. \n \n9.  Project Review \n44.  NWSDB and ADB will jointly assess project implementation semiannually. NWSDB and \nADB will conduct a comprehensive midterm review of project implementation. The reviews will \n(i) examine the appropriateness of scope, design, implementation arrangements, and schedule \nof  activities;  (ii)  assess  implementation  pace  against  project  indicators;  (iii)  assess \nimprovements in operating and financial performance indicators; (iv) evaluate the effect of new \npolicies and their impact on service delivery; (v) assess the responsiveness of urban councils to \nrequests for collection of waste and its impact on the overall sanitary conditions in project towns; \n(vi)  review  compliance  with  project  assurances;  (vii)  assess  effectiveness  of  safeguards \nprocedures; (viii) identify problems and constraints; (ix) and if necessary, recommend changes. \n  \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Expected Benefits and Impacts \n45.  The Project is expected to provide direct connections to the water supply system for \n ", "16 \n46,005  urban  households  (190,874  people)  in  all  four  towns.  In  addition,  about  16,095 \ninstitutional and commercial establishments (nondomestic) will benefit from the supply of piped \nwater from the new system. Service coverage in all four towns will increase from the current 4% \nto a peak of 83% in Vavuniya, from 50% to 84% in Puttalam, from 30% to 91% in Chilaw, and \nfrom 48% to 100% in Mannar. The schemes were tested for financial viability and found to be \nsustainable in all instances (Supplementary Appendix K). Water and sanitation schemes have \nalso proved economically viable (Supplementary Appendix L) with economic internal rates of \nreturn ranging from 13.0% to 19.3% for water supply schemes and from 18.0% to 34.1% for \nseptage collection and management schemes. \n \n  1.  Poverty Reduction and Social Development  \n46.  The socioeconomic survey of 2,837 households conducted during project preparation \nshows high income poverty consistent with Government statistics.49 The project towns have \nacute shortages of drinking water and sanitation. The survey shows that only 14% in Vavuniya, \n50% in Chilaw, 58% in Puttalam, and 62% in Mannar have access to piped water, and it is not \navailable 24 hours a day. Access is lower for poor households, with the number not having \nwater  connections  at  36%  in  Vavuniya,  30.8%  in  Chilaw,  16.3%  in  Mannar,  and  9.9%  in \nPuttalam. During the dry season, the majority spend up to 50 minutes each day fetching water. \nBoth piped and well water suffer from poor quality, with color as the most often cited problem. \nThe substantial time for fetching could be used for productive activities. Access to sanitation \nranges from 78% to 91% in project towns. Through the provision of water supply and sanitation, \nthe Project contributes directly to poverty reduction through achievement of the Millennium \nDevelopment  Goal  target  7;  and  indirectly  by  reducing  regional  disparities  in  urban \ninfrastructure,  which  is  expected  to  impact  economic  growth  and  consequently  poverty \nreduction. The Project has specific design elements that directly target poor beneficiaries such \nas providing community connections to serve internally displaced people\u2019s camps and poorer \nurban dwellers (to be maintained by community-based organizations and low-cost sanitation \nprogram for poor communities in the form of individual household latrines in newly served areas. \nSex-disaggregated data will be collected as part of the baseline surveys. The summary poverty \nreduction and social strategy is in Appendix 11.   \n \n2.  Social and Environmental Safeguards \n47.  Social. The Project is designed to minimize land acquisition and resettlement impacts. It \nwill (i) utilize existing land for rehabilitation of existing water supply facilities; (ii) utilize vacant \nGovernment land to the extent possible for new facilities; and (iii) where Government land is \nunavailable due to constraints (proximity and elevation requirements) in locating facilities, land \nselected will not result in relocation. Acquisition of private and grant lands are required in Chilaw \nfor septage and water treatment, and in Vavuniya for water supply source augmentation. Land \nacquisition in Chilaw involves two parcels (3 acres each) of private land. The parcels do not \nhave any structures and land acquisition will not cause dislocation. One parcel is vacant with no \nproductive assets. The other has 100 old coconut trees. Each parcel has a single owner, and \nthe two affected households have a total of two affected individuals. All affected persons are \ntitled, have income sources that are not dependent on land to be acquired, and none are \nvulnerable. Land acquisition in Vavuniya involves 96 acres of paddy fields. This will affect an \nestimated 39 farmers. Based on the socioeconomic survey of 23 households, the average \n                                                 \n49  Poverty incidence was 28.9% for Chilaw, 37.5% for Mannar, 39.7% for Puttalam, and 24.4% for Vavuniya. Surveys \nshow (i) high poverty gap ratios: 2.06 in Chilaw, 2.79 in Mannar, 2.68 in Puttalam, and 1.7 in Vavuniya; and \nseverity of poverty indices: 0.82 in Chilaw, 1.31 in Mannar, 1.2 in Puttalam, and 0.75 in Vavuniya; (ii) income \ninequality (Gini coefficients) are 0.360 for Chilaw, 0.322 for Mannar, 0.282 for Puttalam, and 0.308 for Vavuniya; \n(iii) low education particularly in Mannar and Chilaw (over 30% of respondents had less than sixth grade \neducation); and (iv) high unemployment: Chilaw 56.8%, Mannar 36.6%, and Puttalam 60.5%. ", "    17 \nfamily size is four, and the estimated number of affected persons is 156. The land is used \nexclusively for cultivation and has no structures. The survey indicates that of the 15 vulnerable \nrespondents 6 are female heads of household and 9 are elderly. Investments in Puttalam and \nMannar will not require permanent land acquisition.50 Resettlement plans were prepared for all \nfour towns (Supplementary Appendix N) and a summary is in Appendix 12. The scope of land \nacquisition and resettlement identified is based on preliminary design and will be updated during \ndetailed design. A guide for updating the resettlement plans was prepared and will be included \nin the project administration manual. Resettlement impacts are to be minimized through careful \nsitting and alignment during detailed design and project implementation. Resettlement plans will \nensure that socioeconomic conditions, needs, and priorities of vulnerable groups are identified; \nand that the process of land acquisition and resettlement does not disadvantage vulnerable \ngroups. Screening showed no impacts on indigenous people; any impacts that may result from \nland acquisition, finalized during detailed design, can be addressed by the resettlement plans. \n \n48.  Environment (Supplementary Appendixes P, Q, and R). The Project is classified as \ncategory B in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003). As part of \nthe  feasibility  study,  initial  environmental  examinations  were  carried  out  for  project \nsubcomponents  in  each  of  the  project  towns.  The  examinations  showed  that  none  of  the \ncomponents would have any significant adverse environmental impacts and all impacts could be \nsuitably mitigated. The only subcomponent warranting greater attention is the construction of a \n4 meter high, 1.5 km long earth bund across a stream to impound up to 3.7 million cubic meters \nof water in an area of 215 hectares for the Vavuniya water supply scheme. However it will not \ncause any major impacts. Anticipated minor environmental impacts include some loss of on-site \necology and the conversion of small amounts of rural agricultural land; dust generation due to \nexcavation activities; and increased vibrations, noise, fumes, and traffic during construction. The \nsummary initial environmental examination is in Appendix 13. An environmental management \nplan was prepared for construction and operation phases of Vavuniya\u2019s water supply scheme \ntank.  Adequate  mitigation  measures  are  proposed  to  minimize  impacts  resulting  from \ninadequate  maintenance  of  septage  treatment  facilities.  Significant  environmental  benefits \nresulting from the Project include (i) improved hygiene and sanitary conditions; (ii) improved \nseptage  handling,  treatment,  and  disposal;  (iii)  improved  ecosystem  health  resulting  from \nreduced discharge of untreated septage into sensitive areas; (iv) reduced water losses from the \ncurrently defective water distribution system; and (v) protection of the fragile aquifer. \n \nB.  Assumptions and Risks \n49.  Political Stability. The success of the Project in meeting its goal continues to assume a \nstable political environment in project areas. Disruption of peace conditions may delay project \nimplementation in Mannar and, to a lesser degree, in Vavuniya. ADB will continue to monitor the \nsecurity  situation,  ensuring  that  the  highest  levels  of  safety,  as  determined  by  the  United \nNations, are applied. NWSDB will brief ADB monthly on the progress of each of the packages, \nimmediately  highlighting  any  disruption  associated  with  security  matters.  The  Project  will \nimplement  specific  mitigation  measures  proven  effective,  including  (i)  careful  monitoring,  \n(ii)  preferred  recruitment  of  district-based  qualified  staff,  (iii)  continued  dialogue  with \nstakeholders and aid partners, (iv) fully participatory and transparent implementation including \ndisclosure of financial information, (v) mobilization of strong community support and trust in \n                                                 \n50  Transect walks record impacts on access, which will be addressed through construction management to ensure \naccess to affected persons (measures are identified in the initial environmental examination). While the transect \nwalks showed that ensuring access will also ensure that there are no livelihood losses; a budget was estimated \nshould the Project result in temporary livelihood losses during rehabilitation and laying of pipe networks, and \ndrainage  works.  These  will  be  confirmed  during  detailed  design.  A  compensation  plan  was  developed  for \ntemporary livelihood impacts of tank works in Puttalam, which is expected to affect the livelihood for one paddy \nseason of 118 farmers and 49 farm workers. The compensation plan is part of the resettlement plan for Puttalam. \n ", "18 \nproject staff, and (vi) encouragement of local employment under project contracts. Design-\nspecific parameters are incorporated to prevent tensions between cohabiting communities. \n \n50.  Reduced  Competition.  Due  to  poor  accessibility  conditions,  few  contractors  may \nexpress interest in packages in northern towns, potentially resulting in higher costs. While \nestimates  have  considered  this,  the  Project  will  offset  risks  by  (i)  improving  packaging,  \n(ii) conducting wide advertisement of tenders, and (iii) providing support to contractors. \n \n51.  Policy. The Project\u2019s financial viability assumes revisions to the national water supply \ntariff. Inadequate cost recovery, maintenance, and asset management will put the schemes\u2019 \nsustainability at risk. Tariff setting needs to be driven by financial considerations and be free of \npolitical influence. Tariffs and connection fees should be affordable by the intended beneficiaries \nto ensure an optimal connection rate and tariff collection, the main sources of revenue for the \nProject. Sustainability will be secured through tariff monitoring and capacity building. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \nA.  Specific Assurances \n52.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and NWSDB have given the \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  The Borrower will ensure that each year during project implementation, adequate \nbudgetary allocations of the required counterpart funds will be made by the \nrelevant authorities on a timely and regular basis. \n(ii)  At the latest by 28 February of each year, NWSDB will have submitted to ADB: \n(a) the end-of-year income statement for the previous year (inclusive of O&M, \ndebt service, and depreciation); and (b) annual projections (inclusive of O&M, \ndebt service, and depreciation) for the coming year.

Access to Safe Drinking Water and Sanitation \n \n1.  Millions of Sri Lanka\u2019s population do not have access to adequate water supply and \nsanitation.  According  to  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme,  in  2004  the  country \nachieved 79% coverage of improved water supply.1 While recent reports indicate that Sri Lanka \nis expected to meet the Millennium Development Goal target 7 by 2015, major challenges faced \ninclude regional disparities and urban\u2013rural differences. Statistics show that urban population \nwith access to improved water sources increased from 91% to 98% between 1990 and 2004; \nwhereas in rural areas, population served increased from 62% to 74%. While 75% of the urban \npopulation is served with piped water, only 14% of the rural population benefits from such \nservice, mostly (65%) relying on water obtained through protected wells. Differences between \nprovinces are even more prominent and conditions in the north and east, particularly in areas \naffected  by  protracted  conflict  and  civil  war,  are  not  fully  reflected  in  aggregate  statistics.2 \nAccording to the same sources, about 91% of the population in Western Province had access to \nsafe drinking water, with the Colombo district recording the highest access at 96%; whereas the \nproportion of households in northern districts with access to improved water supply in 2001 was \nreported to be only 21.2% in Mannar and 67.8% in Vavuniya. The World Bank reports that only \n46% of the population in north and east has access to safe drinking water.3  \n \n2.  Considerable improvements have been achieved in sanitation: urban population with \naccess  to  improved  sanitation  increased  from  89%  to  98%  between  1990  and  2004,  rural \ncoverage rose from 64% to 89%.4 Comparing access to improved sanitation across districts in \nSri Lanka, the highest access is recorded in Colombo (96.2%) and Gampaha (96.5%), and the \nlowest in Batticaloa (57%) in the east. However, caution must be observed as data available for \nthe north and east are sometimes incomplete and less reliable.5 Provision of sewerage services \nin  Sri  Lanka  is  limited  to  some  areas  of  Greater  Colombo6 and  Hikkaduwa.  However,  the \nGovernment is conscious of this growing problem and proposes expansion to other urban areas \nfor Kandy and Jaffna. \n \n3.  Prolonged conflict and low productivity in rural areas have had a severe impact on urban \ncenters. On average, the urban population (currently representing 27% of the national total) is \ngrowing nearly twice as fast as the rural population. Urbanization is projected to reach 45% by \n2015. Regional disparities in the quality and level of public infrastructure services are significant. \nWith  limited  infrastructure  and  services,  old  and  new  urban  centers  are  not  capable  of \nadequately supporting the increasing economic productivity of households. The country\u2019s urban \nareas exhibit problems such as slum and squatter settlements, degraded environment, low \n                                                 \n1  Improved water supply means piped water supply, borehole, protected dug well, protected spring water, rainwater \ncollection, and other technological means for improving water supply to consumers.  \n2  National Council for Economic Development. 2005. Millennium Development Goals Country Report 2005: Sri Lanka. \nColombo. \n3  World Bank. 2007. Sri Lanka Poverty Assessment: Engendering Growth with Equity: Opportunities and Challenges. \nWashington, DC.  \n4  Countrywide population with access to sanitation increased from 69% in 1990 to 91% in 2004. \n5  Few urban areas in the country have sewerage and only Hikaduwa has treatment facilities. Colombo\u2019s sewerage \nnetwork is badly silted and in need of repair. The Government, recognizing the importance of planned sanitation, \nhas programmed the development of sewerage infrastructure in Kandy, Jaffna and Nuwara Eliya,  \n6  The 1993 Master Plan (Engineering Science. 1993. Wastewater Master Plan for Greater Colombo. Colombo) \nestimated that 66% of the Greater Colombo population was served by on-site sanitation facilities, 19% by sewerage \nsystems, and 15% had no facilities. Little is expected to have changed over the past decade. The population without \nfacilities, the urban poor, disposes of their waste on the seashore, in canals and waterways, and on available open \nground. In addition to the 15% without facilities, substantial low-income settlements have access to limited facilities. \n ", "                            Appendix 3        29 \nstandards of infrastructure and services, and overloaded physical infrastructure.7 In small- and \nmedium-sized towns, lack of basic infrastructure for economic development is considered a \nmajor challenge. \n \nB.  Government Targets \n4.  In  support  of  its  poverty  reduction  efforts  and  commitments  to  the  United  Nations \nMillennium Declaration, the Government identifies access to safe drinking water and adequate \nsanitation as priority objectives. Specific goals8 include (i) provision of sufficient and safe drinking \nwater to 85% of the population by 2015 and 100% by 2025, (ii) provision of piped water supply to \n100% of the urban population and 75% of the total rural population by 2010, (iii) service levels \nand quality of water to achieve national standards in urban and rural areas, (iv) access to \nadequate sanitation to 70% of the population of Sri Lanka by 2010 and 100% by 2025, (v) piped \nsewerage  systems  to  be  provided  in  major  urban  areas  and  selected  growth  centers,  and  \n(vi) standard on-site sanitation to be available to all those not connected to a sewerage system \nor sanitation scheme. \n \n5.  The National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) Corporate Plan (2007\u20132011)9 \naims to provide 40% of Sri Lanka\u2019s population with water supply services and 3% with piped \nsewerage coverage during implementation of the plan. Growth centers are to be identified where \npiped schemes are technically and economically viable, and coverage increased where existing \nschemes can be rehabilitated and augmented. Piped sewerage in 2006 is reported to have \nserved 479,922 people or 2.4% of the population. Rehabilitation and partial augmentation of \nGreater Colombo\u2019s sewerage scheme will substantially contribute to achieving this target. \n \nC.  Policy and Institutions \n6.  Institutional Mandates for Water and Sanitation (Service Delivery). The Ministry of \nWater  Supply  and  Drainage  is  the  lead  agency  in  the  water  supply  and  sanitation  sector, \nhowever the Ministry of Urban Development and Sacred Areas has a number of competencies \nrelating to rural water and sanitation. The Ministry of Water Supply and Drainage is the policy \nmaking body in Sri Lanka for the development and improvement of water supply and sanitation. \nAll  major  government  water  supply  and  sanitation  projects,  particularly  in  urban  areas,  are \ncentralized at the Ministry of Water Supply and Drainage and the ministry is often tasked as the \nexecuting agency for foreign-funded projects. While the National Water Supply and Drainage \nBoard  (NWSDB),  under  the  Ministry  of  Water  Supply  and  Drainage,  is  mandated  with \nimplementing  water  development  projects  in  urban  and  rural  areas,  the  Ministry  of  Urban \nDevelopment and Sacred Areas (through the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Division) is \nactively involved in rural areas. NWSDB is involved in the supply of piped water and sewerage \nservices, however relevant laws also provide powers and responsibilities to municipal and urban \ncouncils and pradeshiya sabhas to establish and maintain schemes for their constituency. On a \nsmaller scale, some nongovernment organizations (NGOs) and community-based organizations \nare actively involved in providing services. \n \n7.  Policies. The draft Water Supply and Sanitation Policy formulated in 2002 provides \nguidance to NWSDB, provincial councils, local authorities, lending institutions, community-based \norganizations, and NGOs involved in delivering water supply and sanitation services. It covers \ninvestment strategies to achieve coverage, service quality, and cost-recovery objectives. The \n                                                 \n7  Deficiencies include deteriorated roads, inadequate potable water supplies, poor drainage, and domestic sanitation. \n8  Department of National Planning. 2006.

In \n2006, NWSDB prepared revised water and sanitations policies. NWSBD\u2019s board has reviewed \nand approved both the draft water supply policy and draft sanitation policy, which are due for \nsubmission for approval by Cabinet within 2008.  \n \n8.  Regulation. Regulators are generally responsible for monitoring and enforcing discharge \nlicenses and fees, and service quality, as received by customers; and setting affordable and \nefficient  tariffs.  The  Public  Utilities  Commission,  created  by  Parliament  in  late  2002,  is  a \nmultisector regulator for water, electricity, and ports. Although commissioners were appointed \nsoon after, its functions have not been fully effected, which may be partly due to delays in the \nformulation and approval of the Water Industry Act. The Government is currently reviewing \nmeans  and  requirements  to  bring  NWSDB\u2019s  operations  in  line  with  the  Public  Utilities \nCommission Act and enable the latter to undertake its technical and economic regulation.10 \n \n9.  The Central Environmental Authority (CEA) is the key agency with powers to enact \nregulations for wastewater pollution control and discharge standards. For all Board of Investment \n(BOI)-registered industries, CEA has delegated its powers to enforce the regulations to BOI. The \npretreatment  standards  currently  applied  to  the  industries  within  the  BOI-owned  processing \nzones  are  not  national  standards  but  BOI\u2019s  own  requirements.  Implementation  of  the  CEA \nregulations for certain industry can be delegated to local authorities. The Urban Development \nAuthority  is  responsible  for  regulatory  matters  concerning  rulers  and  guidelines  for \nimplementation of on-site sanitation. \n \n10.  Water Resource Management. In Sri Lanka, inefficient use of water resources has been \nexacerbated by the fact that a variety of agencies have exploited the resource, each pursuing its \nown mandate, with no single agency having stewardship over the country\u2019s water resources per \nse. In the past, studies11 identified up to 28 agencies in 10 ministries responsible for one or more \naspects of water resource management.12 This multiplicity of agencies operating in the water \nmanagement sector, more or less independently of each other, continues to result in distortions \nand inefficiencies. This includes (i) large water users allocating water to themselves, assuming \nboth the roles of regulator and user, potentially allocating water in an impartial manner; (ii) water \nrequired for environmental and social needs may not be protected since these uses are not \nrecognized in policy and no mechanisms exist to legally safeguard minimum in-stream flows or \nreservoir levels; (iii) the supply of water for existing uses is vulnerable where new water use \ncontinues  to  be  allowed\u2014this  lack  of  control  of  water  demand  increases  the  risk  of  water \nshortages and reduces the value of downstream water-related investment; (iv) water allocation is \nnot flexible, therefore new users cannot be supplied by voluntary transfer of water from existing \nusers\u2014thus existing users have no incentive to improve efficiency of water use and recognize \nthe value of their allocation; and (v) no planning system is in place to allocate water to priority \nuses. \n \n                                                 \n10  With technical assistance support (ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri \nLanka for Strengthening the Regulatory Framework for Water Supply and Sanitation. Manila.), the Government is in \nthe process of developing (i) an adequate tariff-setting methodology, (ii) a customer code, and (iii) technical \nstandards for water and sewerage services.  \n11  ADB. 1995. Technical Assistance to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for Institutional Strengthening for \nComprehensive Water Resources Management. Manila.  \n12  This includes the Irrigation Department; Water Resources Board; Ceylon Electricity Board; Mahaweli Authority; \nNWSDB; Reclamation Corporation; CEA (national); and provincial councils and local authorities, which are also \nresponsible for local water resource management issues.   \n ", "                            Appendix 3        31 \n11.  Water  Resources  Board.  This board functions with meager funds from government \nsubsidies. Its functions do not match its mandate and are limited to advisory services to the \nminister, with funds barely able to cover research and investigation of groundwater resources \n(few discontinued studies are noted in selected areas of Vavuniya, Mannar, and Puttalam). The \nboard is authorized to advise the minister on matters relating to regulation of groundwater \nextraction, but due to insufficient support this function has never been undertaken.  \n \nD.  NWSDB Performance and Targets \n12.  Planning and Asset Management. NWSDB\u2019s current corporate plan does not present a \nsolid business plan with financial projections that translate action plans into financial terms, and \nkey performance and result areas into financial targets or indicators that can be monitored. The \nannual budget is prepared over 5 months using the performance-based budgeting method, \nwhere costs and inputs are planned to match performance and outputs. Historically, operation \ninvestment-related functions have been more closely based on a crisis-management approach \nthan through strategic decisions considering risk analyses and the long-term future sustainability \nof a network, or a holistic approach considering all influences upon the options available whether \nthey  are  legal,  technical,  financial,  regulatory,  operations,  or  customer  service  driven.13 Yet \nNWSDB has acknowledged that revisions to its operating approach must be introduced. It is in \nthe process of introducing, among others, a program to decentralize responsibilities to regional \noffices.14 This, if adequately strengthened, is expected to lead to rapid and responsive decision \nmaking. \n \n13.  NWSDB\u2019s Financial and Operating Performance. The financial performance of the \nNWSDB improved in 2006 compared to previous years. Profit before depreciation increased by \nabout 3%. Profit was made before income tax instead of losses as in the previous years. A \nsummary of the income statement for 2004\u20132006 is shown in Table A3.1. Although financial \nperformance improved in 2006 as measured by lower net loss, the Board was not operating \nefficiently as demonstrated by the increase in direct operating expenses at 13%, more than the \nincrease in water sales of 8%. This is largely due to an increase in nonrevenue water (NRW), \nmostly for Greater Colombo operations.15 This will have a direct impact on sewerage operations \nand billing and thus must be addressed. \n \nTable A3.1: NWSDB\u2019s Net Profit Summary, 2004\u20132006 \n(SLRs) \n Item  2004  2005  2006 \nWater Sales   4,263,831  5,446,264  5,869,448 \nOperating Profit on Sale of Water  809,699  1,842,239  1,788,923 \nProfit/(Loss) before Depreciation  409,213  1,479,961  1,525,310 \nNet Profit/(Loss) from Operating Activities  (383,484)     436,599      425,303 \nProfit/(Loss) before Income Tax  (811,870)       (22,272)        19,816 \nNet Profit/(Loss) for the Year  (836,501)       (91,901)        (44,048) \n       ( ) = negative, NWSDB = National Water Supply and Drainage Board, SLRs = Sri Lankan rupees. \n       Sources: NWSDB annual reports 2004, 2005, and 2006. \n \n                                                 \n13  Asset management can be defined as the process of establishing an operating regime under which the sustainability \nof capital investment for assets is ensured through effective management of risk, performance, condition, and cost. \n14  An analysis of the existing setup revealed the following shortcomings: (i) operating center has no fiscal power and \nability to generate sufficient revenues; (ii) no proper matching of costs against revenues, hence a perennial problem \nof lack of funds for repairs and improvement; (iii) regional operating units operate in a system discouraging \nperformance incentives; (iv) centralized financial management implies that requesting a budget for repairs is \nconstrained by bureaucratic procedures and inability to prioritize taking into consideration the local context; and  \n(v) recruitment and hiring of staff is highly centralized.  \n15  If the authorized but unbilled water supply in Colombo city (estimated at 14% of the water supplied) is excluded, \nNRW in Greater Colombo would be 30.2%, while the national average would be 30%. \n ", "32  Appendix 3 \n14.  NWSDB has expanded its scope of activities considerably over the past 30 years. The \nnumber of water service connections has increased annually by an average of 11% or 57,416 for \nthe last 10 years. In addition, the number of staff per connection has improved significantly, \nreducing from a relatively high staff/connection ratio of 27.6 staff per 1,000 connections in the \ninitial years to 8.92 in August 2005. The billing and collection system, in place since 1982 and \nfully computerized since 1987, is performing adequately, however no performance improvements \nare noted for 2004\u20132006.16 Despite the poor collection performance, the Board\u2019s current ratios \nwere high, indicating high liquidity. Debt service coverage ratio likewise improved due to better \nfinancial performance, i.e., lower net loss in 2006.  \n \n15.  NWSDB, conducted a benchmarking exercise in 2003 and, through its corporate strategy, \nhas set targets for improved operating and financial performance. Progress has been achieved \nby programs relating to reduction of power consumption and staffing ratios, but performance in \nthe area of reduction of NRW remains inadequate and generally underfunded. NRW remains the \nsingle largest contributor to increasing NWSDB\u2019s performance and revenue. Indicators show that \nNRW  has  remained  constant  in  relative  terms  since  2002  (around  34%),  but  increased  in \nabsolute terms. NWSDB acknowledges the problem and is in the process of introducing a \nstrategy and action plan to tackle NRW, however to date this program is being restricted to \nGreater Colombo.  \n \nTable A3.2: NWSDB Operating Performance Summary, 2002\u20132006 \n  Dec 2002  Dec 2003  Dec 2004  Dec 2005  Dec 2006 \nResults Provided by NWSDB   Baseline  Results  Results  Results  Results \nA.

A financial performance assessment conducted for each of the \nfour focus project towns (Chilaw, Mannar, Puttalam, and Vavuniya) reveals variable regional \ncapacities. The financial position of Puttalam\u2019s scheme was strengthened during 2004\u20132006, \nwith net profits of around 13% for 2005 and 2006. Capacity constraints are expected to be the \nmajor  threat  confronting  the  scheme,  affecting  its  operating  efficiency.  While  the  financial \nperformance of Chilaw\u2019s water supply scheme was not as financially sound, it has gradually \nreduced operating losses and increased water sales. It recorded an operating profit in 2006. The \nsituation in Vavuniya and Mannar is much more critical. Despite the fact that these schemes are \nmuch smaller, operating and nonoperating costs are comparable. Root causes are believed to \ninclude  (i)  inefficient  equipment  and  machinery,  highly  degraded  by  years  of  conflict  and \ninadequate maintenance; and (ii) major NRW resulting from water losses arising from apparent \nlosses  (unauthorized  consumption  and  metering  inaccuracies),  and  real  losses  (leakage  of \ntransmission  and/or  distribution  mains,  leakage  and  overflows  at  utility  storage  tanks,  and \nleakage of service connections up to customer's meters). These must be immediately addressed \nand a program of NRW reduction put in place. \n                                                 \n16  The accounts receivable balance could not be reduced to at least 2 months of water sales. \n ", "   Appendix 4  33\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE WATER AND SANITATION SECTOR  \n \n                                      Year                        Amount \nProject Name                               Approved              Source             (million) \nA.

The  approach  sought  under  the  Project  strongly  focuses  on  improving  institutional \nefficiency (operating and financial) and long-term sustainability. The following features define its \nstrategy. \n \nA.  Improved Service Provision \n2.  The  National  Water  Supply  and  Drainage  Board  (NWSDB)  has  developed  5-year \ncorporate plans since 1996. The latest plan1 clearly identifies commercial viability, and greater \naccountability and transparency as key goals to be pursued by the organization. The plan sets \nforth specific objectives and countrywide targets, and identifies corporate investment and asset \nmanagement as key focus areas of implementation. \n \n3.  NWSDB  Decentralized  Service  Delivery. NWSDB has grown extensively since its \ncreation in 1974, but its current size2 and excessively centralized management approach has \nled to several inefficiencies. In addition to its head office, until recently NWSDB was divided into \nsix regional support centers3 and 23 regional offices throughout Sri Lanka. Services provided \n(population  covered,  number  of  connections,  and  quality  and  quantity  of  water  available), \ninfrastructure  and  water  production,  staffing,  operation  and  maintenance  expenditure,  and \nrecovery  vary  significantly  among  the  regional  support  centers.4  In  parallel,  customer \nsatisfaction, water resource availability, financial management, human resource management, \nand accountability vary across the country. Because the regional support centers and regional \noffices  are  closer  to  the  beneficiary  population,  they  have  an  information  advantage  in \nidentifying citizens\u2019 preferences as well as the flexibility to respond to local conditions. The \nProject will support NWSDB in attaining decentralized service delivery by (i) implementing \nactivities through relevant district offices, and applying institutional arrangements that reinforce \nthis system; (ii) supporting the establishment of a regional support center (northern); and (iii) \nstrengthening functions and human resource capacity in district offices. \n \n4.  Improving NWSDB Operating Efficiency. The Project emphasizes in its design the \nimportance of achieving improved operating efficiency and will introduce (i) energy efficiency \nmeasures (which will be subject to an energy audit); (ii) process optimization (through the \nintroduction of automation and hydraulic modeling); and (iii) nonrevenue water reduction. The \nnonrevenue water reduction program will be comprehensive in all four project towns (Table A5). \n \nB.  Integrated Water and Sanitation Approach  \n5.  As water supply augmentation is considered in emerging regional centers, wastewater \nmanagement must be addressed as an integral part of the solution. Based on appropriate-\ntechnology,  affordability  and  financial  viability,  and  health  and  environmental  principles, \nsolutions have been found to match the needs of the various centers. Sanitation also involves \nchanging attitudes and behavior (especially hygiene habits), developing solutions, and creating \na demand for sanitation as a means for making systems effective. \n \n6.  Establishing Partnerships with Local Authorities. Local governments are currently \nlargely responsible for sanitation in their constituencies. In the four project towns, urban councils \nare providing this service, although quality and frequency is bound by equipment limitations and \n                                                 \n1  NWSDB. 2007. Corporate Plan (2007\u20132011). Colombo. \n2  In June 2007, NWSDB had 8,310 employees, of which 7,525 were regular staff. This is equivalent to 7.67 staff per \n1,000 connections. \n3  NWSDB is in the process of increasing this to 11, one for each province and two for Colombo. \n4  The western and Greater Colombo regional support centers, and the head office account for almost 50% of \nNWSDB\u2019s staff resources, 53% of NWSDB\u2019s connections, and 65% of all drinking water produced. NWSDB. 2006. \nAnnual Report. Colombo. \n ", "   Appendix 5  35\nlack of proper facilities. In association with water augmentation to regional cities, the capacity of \nurban councils must be strengthened to safely manage wastewater, and especially septage. \nThe Project proposes to establish a partnership approach between NWSDB\u2019s regional offices \nand their counterparts in the urban councils to enable timely implementation of a sanitation \nprogram and construction of facilities to improve septage collection, management, and disposal \nin an environmentally acceptable manner. \n \nTable A5: Nonrevenue Water Reduction Program \nNRW Cause  Proposed Activity \nUnbilled authorized  A full registrar of unbilled authorized consumers is prepared. Volumetric records are collected \nconsumption  and analyzed. Magnitude (%) is determined.  \nDecision for discontinuation evaluated versus legal justification. \nApparent water  As part of the rehabilitation and expansion of the water system, regional office staff will, \nlosses: unauthorized  together with the contractor, identify unauthorized connections and immediately proceed to (i) \nconsumption  either regularize or (ii) disconnect.  \nA database reflecting information on all authorized and unauthorized connections will be \ncreated and updated. Procedures and protocols will be developed to guide regional office staff \nhandling illegal connections and requests for new connections. Staff will be trained on (i) how \nto deal with this type of consumer, and (ii) how to transform these into metered connections.  \nApparent water  Activities to be undertaken during project implementation by regional office teams include \nlosses: metering  independent meter reading audits to undertake (i) reading of all meters for comparison against \ninaccuracies  reported data, and (ii) identification of all defective meters.   \nStaff will be trained in (i) identification of defective meters and causes leading to this \n(accidental or deliberate), and (ii) maintenance and repair of meter units. As part of the \nawareness campaign, consumers will be made aware of the fact that purposeful tampering \nwith water meters is a criminal offence that can and will be prosecuted. \nReal losses:  As part of the Project, all leaking pipes, valves, and specials will be replaced by the contractor \nleakage of  after conducting necessary testing (with ultrasound flow meters or otherwise). In addition, bulk \ntransmission and/or  meters will be procured very early into implementation and installed to enable water balances \ndistribution mains  in the transmission and distribution system. Protocols will be developed and regular readings \n(at least daily if not automated) will be undertaken and reported. Leak detection kits will be \nprocured and staff trained accordingly. \nReal losses:  Leakage and overflows at utility storage tanks will be minimized through the installation of \nleakage and  level sensors and systematic automation of all units (and associated introduction of control \noverflows at utility  systems). Staff will be trained on how to operate automated systems.   \nstorage tanks  \nReal losses:  Staff,  once  trained  on  how  to  conduct  water  balances  (including  data  from  production, \nleakage of service  transmission,  storage  units,  and  household  meters)  will  be  able  to  identify  whether \nconnections up to  reconciliation of these balances can be achieved through payments of service connections. \ncustomer's meters  Staff will be trained on conducting randomized checks (associate defects of a particular batch \nto extrapolate to other connections) and repairs.   \nSource: Asian Development Bank assessment \n \n7.  Strengthening  Local  Government  Capacity.  The  Project  has  developed  a  clear \nframework for septage management, treatment, and disposal. Based on its relative simplicity, \nthe schemes are believed to be most adequate for towns of the size of the project towns, as \nthey provide the first level of service and strengthen the capacity of local bodies to undertake \ntheir functions in this respect. The following comprehensive approach is proposed: \n(i)  Establish a coherent legal framework by introducing bylaws for (a) compulsory \nuse of septic tanks in clearly demarcated geographic areas, and (b) charging a \nminimum fee that will cover operation and maintenance (O&M) costs. \n(ii)  Generate revenue by introducing a scheme-specific charge to at least cover \nO&M, and collecting (by local authorities) a sewerage charge. \n(iii)  Local  authorities  are  to  implement  the  schemes  with  technical  support  from \nNWSDB.  Schemes  may  be  implemented  as  a  design-and-build  contract,  as \nexpertise within the country is limited (given the new approach). Contractors are \nto provide 1 year maintenance as part of the contractual agreement. \n ", " 36  Appendix 5 \n(iv)  O&M of the schemes may be subsequently outsourced to the private sector \nthrough a performance-based management contract. Monitoring of the private \nsector performance is to be enhanced through contractual agreements for public \nlatrines. \n(v)  Local authorities are to provide capacity development for (a) legal drafting of \ncontractual  agreements  (construction  and  O&M),  and  (b)  environmental  and \nperformance monitoring. \n8.  Key environmental performance objectives for on-site facilities are (i) wastewater will not \ncause topsoil contamination, (ii) surface water will not be polluted, (iii) groundwater will not be \npolluted, (iv) discharge will not upset the ecological balance, (v) waste should not be accessible \nto vectors and other animals, and (vi) waste should not be a nuisance due to bad odor or smell. \nProper enforcement of the legislation would enable achievement of these objectives; however \ncompliance with groundwater pollution requirements remains a problem. More care needs to be \ntaken in assessing the dispersal qualities of the soil and selecting suitable designs.   \n \n9.  Institutionalizing Compliance Monitoring. In an effort to promote compliance with the \nexisting  regulatory  framework,  local  authorities  will  need  to  introduce  a  program  of \nenvironmental monitoring activities on (i) quality of discharge to sea, if any; and (ii) quality of \ntreated septage.  \n \nC.  Integrated Water Resource Management \n10.  Although Sri Lanka\u2019s total water supplies are abundant compared with those in other arid \ncountries, water stress is now being experienced, and regional and seasonal variations in \nsupply and demand create concerns. Existing urban water supply systems in project towns \nsuffer  from  chronic,  and  occasionally  acute,  water  shortage;  and  delays  in  new  domestic \nconnections are linked to uncertainty in water availability. The Project has considered these \naspects and incorporated integrated water resource management concepts in its design through \n(i) securing comprehensive investigations (including 1-year quality and yield data) for surface \nand groundwater schemes, (ii) developing catchment protection plans, and (iii) developing local \ncapacity and databases to monitor groundwater usage and depletion. The Project is phasing \nconstruction to facilitate monitoring of any upstream and downstream impacts. \n \nD.  Improved Financial Management \n11.  While  improvement  of  the  system\u2019s  performance,  coupled  with  a  higher  rate  of \nconnections, will help improve the finances of NWSDB, great emphasis is being placed on \nsecuring compliance with NWSDB\u2019s owned defined objectives (footnote 1): (i) increase tariffs \nannually by at least inflation, (ii) ensure tariffs are sufficient to prevent any national losses \n(generating a small profit), and (iii) ensure tariffs are sufficient to cover at least O&M of all \nschemes. NWSDB and the Ministry of Water Supply and Drainage have agreed to submit the \ntariff methodology for approval by Cabinet before the date set for loan negotiations. All local \nseptage schemes must cover no less than O&M costs. This is to be secured through the \nintroduction of necessary bylaws (prior to contract award). \n \nE.  Urban Planning  \n12.  The design of project schemes is based on development patterns envisaged under plans \nprepared by the respective urban development authorities. These have been discussed with \nurban councils and, given the nature and large floating populations present in most of the \nproject towns, designs have accommodated the necessary flexibility. \n \n ", "   Appendix 6  37\nCAPACITY ASSESSMENT AND DEVELOPMENT PROPOSAL  \n \n1.  Capacity development needs to consider four essential levels or entry points: (i) the \nenabling environment, (ii) sector capacity, (iii) organization or entity\u2019s capacity, (iv) individual \n \nagency employee capacity, and (v) end user or beneficiary.1 Capacity development activities at \nthese four levels are interrelated, depending on and reinforcing each other, therefore they must \nbe undertaken simultaneously.  \n \nA.  The Enabling Environment \n \n2.  The Government\u2019s Ten-Year Development Framework (2006\u20132016) objectives clearly \nidentify access to safe drinking water as an essential element of reaching the Government\u2019s \neconomic  growth  and  productivity  targets.  The  Government  realizes  that  improvements  in \naccess to water supply services have led to an increasing wastewater problem. Consequently \nclear and consistent policy principles need to be introduced and firmed up. In addition, it agrees \nthat  securing  adequate  revenue  flow  to  cover  full  operation  and  maintenance  costs  of  all \nschemes is a priority to secure adequate sector functioning.  \n \n3.  The Project will support (i) adoption of national drinking water supply and sanitation \npolicies,2 (ii) implementation of a new national sewerage tariff3 and official adoption of local \ngovernment septage maintenance fees,4 and (iii) adoption of independent regulation of the \nsector (and in particular the National Water Supply and Drainage Board [NWSDB]).  \n \nB.  Sector Network \n \n4.  Essential institutional changes are required to introduce (i) systematic infrastructure \nrenewals to maintain the system\u2019s serviceability, (ii) incentives for operating efficiency and \nimproved service delivery, (iii) managerial autonomy and more efficient systems of procurement, \n(iv) improved financial management and cost recovery, and (v) institutional development to gain \nexperience operating in a commercial environment. \n \n5.  The  Project  will  work  to  introduce  performance-based  management  systems  by  \n(i) supporting NWSDB\u2019s efforts to decentralize functions and responsibilities to its regional \noffices; (ii) benchmarking local performance, setting targets, and institutionalizing a well-defined \nmonitoring  and  reporting  system;  and  (iii)  introducing  and  promoting  asset  management \nplanning.  \n \nC.  Organization or Entity\u2019s Capacity Development \n \n6.  Specific support will be provided to improve the capacity of NWSDB\u2019s regional units \n(North and North Western) by (i) introducing commercial functions and improved meter reading, \nbilling,  and  collection;  (ii)  developing  customer  service  functions;  (iii)  developing  general \naccounting  and  financial  reporting;  (iv)  introducing  fixed  asset  management  and  planning;  \n(v) setting up systems for inventory, stores, and purchasing; (vi) improving budgetary planning \nand  control;  (vii)  improving  maintenance  of  water  supply  and  sewerage  facilities;  and  \n(viii)  developing  human  resource  management,  administration,  and  general  services.  The \nProject  will  support  NWSDB\u2019s  efforts  to  reduce  nonrevenue  water  by  introducing  a \n                                                 \n1  Management Development and Governance Division, United Nations Development Programme. 1997.

The Project will develop \nNWSDB staff capacity (Vavuniya and Puttalam) by (i) introducing systems for cost accounting, \nbudget preparation, financial reporting, billing and collection, customer relations, operation and \nmaintenance, asset management, and administration; and (ii) providing necessary training. The \nProject will provide support for regional support centers to develop their core functions of \nplanning and development, and report consolidation.  \n \n9.  Local Authorities. Local authorities generally lack the technical capability and design \nknowledge5 to know which type of facility is most appropriate for given soil conditions. They do \nnot carry out soil testing to aid in the design selection process. NWSDB has produced Manual 1: \nLatrine Construction6 to aid the design process. It provides guidance regarding the type of \nfacility to choose for given soil conditions, but does not provide guidance on how to carry out \ntesting. In addition, (i) due to lack of capacity, inspection, and supervision of construction to \nconfirm compliance with an approved design, and (ii) due to lack of knowledge regarding siting; \nlaws and requirements\u2014further exacerbated by small subdivision of land where the regulations \ncannot be properly met\u2014are weak. In addition, extensive discussions with local authorities \nunder the on-site sanitation pilot scheme reveal (i) limited capacity within the local authorities\u2019 \nlegal departments to formulate management contracts with the private sector, and (ii) limited \ncapacity  within  technical  departments  to  monitor  performance.  The  implementation  of  the \nCentral Environmental Authority regulations for certain industry sectors can be delegated to \nlocal authorities. However, due to lack of institutional capacity, this function has not been \neffectively  transferred.  Hence,  the  Central  Environmental  Authority  continues  to  monitor \nimplementation of the regulations. \n \n10.  The Project will review, update, and print copies of a revised on-site sanitation manual \n(or a second volume) to address (i) soil testing and its impact on system design, (ii) key aspects \nto be considered for adequate supervision of construction, and (iii) adequate siting of pits and \nsoakage  and/or  infiltration  fields.  Training  sessions  with  technical  officers,  public  health \ninspectors, and engineering sections, where available, will be conducted for all local authorities \nwithin Greater Colombo. The Project will formulate manuals and provide technical capacity to \nlocal authorities participating in the pilot on-site sanitation scheme for preparing and monitoring \nperformance-based management contracts with the private sector. In the absence of necessary \n                                                 \n5  On-site sanitation systems are acceptable methods  for  wastewater management used extensively in many \ncountries, particularly for low-density areas and isolated communities. They can also be used effectively in urban \nareas; however, much attention needs to be paid. Major shortcomings include (i) poor design, (ii) inadequate \nsupervision of construction, (iii) inappropriate siting of pits and soakage and/or infiltration fields, (iv) overloading, \nand (v) poor maintenance. Capacity development is currently needed for (i) local authority employees, and (ii) end \nusers and beneficiaries.  \n6  Under package C, ADB. 1997. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a \nProposed Loan to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Third Water Supply and Sanitation \nProject. Manila. \n ", "   Appendix 6  39\nspecialized knowledge, results may be limited; a capacity development program is proposed for \nlocal authorities on environmental compliance with discharge from small industries. \n \nE.  End User or Beneficiary  \n11.  The Project will target end users through the implementation of a community education \nand  awareness  program,  specifically  focusing  on  (i)  public  health,  hygiene,  and  sanitation \nprinciples;  (ii)  water  resource  conservation  and  protection,  and  associated  environmental \nmatters; and (iii) introduction and greater understanding of tariffs. The campaign will seek to \nensure a clear understanding and objective of the Project and manage expectations.   \n \n12.  To support local authorities, two major problems identified relate to end users and \nbeneficiaries:  (i)  inadequate  design  and  location  of  soakage  pits  and  septic  tanks,  \n(ii)  overloading,  and  (iii)  poor  maintenance.  The  Project,  as  part  of  its  public  awareness \ncampaign,  will  support  the  preparation  of  a  series  of  brochures  explaining  dangers  of \noverloading and poor maintenance, and good practices; and providing contact information for \nthe local authorities for septic tank sludge removal.   \n ", "   \n4\nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES  0\n \n \nTable A7.1: Detailed Cost Estimates by Expenditure Category ($ million)    \n \n \n     A\np\n     Foreign  Local  Total  p\n% of Total Base Cost  e\n     Exchange  Currency  Cost  n\nd\n  Item  ix\n    A   .

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.   Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe  Project  will  improve  water  supply  service  delivery  and  expand  services  to  underserved  areas  in  four  towns  in \ndisadvantaged districts of Sri Lanka. The project towns are in poor districts with poverty incidence at 31.3% for Chilaw, 42.5% \nfor Mannar, 45.9% for Puttalam, and 27.5% for Vavuniya. The Project will provide low-cost sanitation and septage or sewage \ntreatment in the four towns. \n \nThe Project will directly support social and environmental development for the poor as specified in the nationalized Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), specifically target 7, which aims to halve the proportion of people without sustainable access to \ndrinking water and basic sanitation by 2015. This contributes to the National Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy \n(NPRGS, 2004) which aims to mainstream long-term MDGs into the national development framework; and minimize regional \nvariations in the incidence of poverty and narrow regional disparities in development. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention (TI-M) \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nThe NPRGS (2004) is a policy framework to steer pro-poor, pro-growth, and income redistribution strategies. Among its main \nobjectives are minimizing regional variations in the incidence of poverty; narrowing regional disparities in development; and \nfacilitating the mainstreaming of long-term MDGs into the national development framework. The MDGs for Sri Lanka (2005) \nidentify access to water and sanitation as impeding poverty reduction; increasing access is a national priority. \n \nThe Mahinda Chinthana: Vision for a New Sri Lanka, Development Framework 2006\u20132016 identifies that poverty is mainly \nconfined to the districts in the north and east, and poor infrastructure is a factor causing higher poverty in these districts. In \nresponse, the document includes infrastructure and area-based poverty reduction programs for the development of the north \nand east. Improvement and expansion of infrastructure including water supply and sanitation, and urban infrastructure are \nidentified as activities that will accelerate economic growth, resulting in poverty reduction.  \n \nThrough the provision of water supply and sanitation, the Project contributes directly to poverty reduction through the \nachievement of MDG target 7; and indirectly by reducing regional disparities in urban infrastructure, which is expected to \nimpact economic growth and consequently poverty reduction.  \n \nThe Project targets full water supply coverage for populations in the project towns: approximately 200,000 people by project \ncompletion and 420,000 people by the end of the projected scheme\u2019s life (2030). The Project will construct an estimated \n1,500 individual household latrines estimated to benefit 7,500 people; and septage and sewage treatment with an estimated \n200,000 beneficiaries. \n2. Design Features  \n \nThe Project supports the objective of the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) of increasing overall access to \nimproved water supply facilities in urban areas to 90% in 2009 and 100% in 2016. The Project will (i) improve service delivery, \nand (ii) expand services to underserved areas. Improvements in service delivery will focus on providing better quality water \nand lengthening water supply service duration to 24 hours, 7 days a week in all project towns at an adequate water pressure. \nThe Project aims to provide full coverage for populations in the project area. For this purpose, NWSDB will (i) have provided \nwithin 1 year of project completion, connections to all households that have placed requests; and (ii) ensure that all \nstandposts are converted to metered community connections with clearly identified users. Community connections, while \nlimited, remain essential in the Project\u2019s context, particularly those serving internally displaced people\u2019s camps and poorer \nurban  dwellers.  Communities  supplied  with  water  through  communal  metered  facilities  will  form  community-based \norganizations (CBOs) that will register and sign an agreement with NWSDB. The CBOs will nominate representatives to \ncoordinate and collect payments. \n \nThe Project will provide funds to conduct a low-cost sanitation program for poor communities in the form of individual \nhousehold latrines in periurban newly served areas. Priority will be given to lower income households and those that do not \nown or have access to basic latrines. It will aim to provide adequate cost-effective small-scale infrastructure. Nongovernment \norganizations will be engaged to support the Project and local government in mobilizing communities, delivering essential \ntraining, conducting a technical assessment, and evaluating initial capital investment for proposed schemes. \n \n ", "  Appendix 11   47\nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nA socioeconomic survey covering 2,837 households was conducted in the project area areas during project preparation. The \nresults were verified and supplemented with focus group discussions. The survey covered household profile, income and \nexpenditures, assets and control over resources, access to water and sanitation, access to sanitation and health, social \ncapital, and environmental sanitation. \n \nThe survey shows high income poverty in the project towns with poverty incidence at 28.9% for Chilaw, 37.5% for Mannar, \n39.7% for Puttalam, and 24.4% for Vavuniya. This is consistent with government statistics. The survey also shows high \npoverty gap ratios\u20142.06 in Chilaw, 2.79 in Mannar, 2.68 in Puttalam, and 1.7 in Vavuniya\u2014and severity of poverty indices: \n0.82 in Chilaw, 1.31 in Mannar, 1.2 in Puttalam, and 0.75 in Vavuniya. Income inequality based on Gini coefficients are 0.360 \nin Chilaw, 0.322 in Mannar, 0.282 in Puttalam, and 0.308 in Vavuniya. \n \nThe survey also reflects relatively low education particularly in Mannar and Chilaw, where more than 30% of respondents \nhave less than sixth-grade education. Unemployment is high at 56.8% in Chilaw, 36.6% in Mannar, and 60.5% in Puttalam. Of \nthose employed, a high percentage are laborers or have low-income and seasonal jobs. \n \nThe project towns have acute shortages of drinking water and sanitation. The survey shows that only 14% in Vavuniya, 50% \nin Chilaw, 58% in Puttalam, and 62% in Mannar have access to piped water. Piped water is not available for 24 hours a day in \nany of the towns. Access to safe drinking water is an even more serious issue for poor households. The number of poor \nhouseholds not having water connections is 36% in Vavuniya, 30.8% in Chilaw, 16.3% in Mannar, and 9.9% in Puttalam. \nThose without access to piped water often source their water from wells. During the dry season, the majority spend up to \n50 minutes each day fetching water. Both piped and well water are poor quality, with color the most often-cited problem. The \nsubstantial time for fetching could be used for potentially productive activities. Access to sanitation ranges from 78%\u201391% in \nproject towns. Most is poor quality and with poor or no maintenance. Combined with wastewater polluting surrounding areas \nand health hazards from the poor urban environment, lack of safe water and adequate sanitation increases the incidence of \nwater-borne disease. \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nA stakeholder analysis was undertaken to identify stakeholders during project preparation. Two stakeholder meetings were \nheld in each of the four towns at the beginning and end of project preparation. These were held to discuss water demand, \nneed, access to water and sanitation, and project coverage. Separate consultations were undertaken on safeguards. \n \n2.

Scope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n1.  The  Project  aims  to  improve  urban  water  supply  and  sanitation  infrastructure  and \nservices in Sri Lanka\u2019s dry zone by (i) improving and expanding infrastructure and services;  \n(ii)  strengthening  institutions  in  the  water  sector  for  better  service  delivery  and  resource \nmanagement; and (iii) building project management and implementation capacity in four towns: \nChilaw, Mannar, Puttalam, and Vavuniya. The Project is designed to minimize land acquisition \nand resettlement impacts. It will (i) utilize existing lands for rehabilitation of existing water supply \nfacilities;  (ii)  utilize  vacant  Government  land  to  the  extent  possible  for  new  facilities;  and  \n(iii)  where  Government  land  is  unavailable  due  to  constraints  (proximity  and  elevation \nrequirements) in locating facilities, select land that does not cause dislocation. Investments in \nPuttalam and Mannar will not require permanent land acquisition.1  \n \n2.  Acquisition of private and grant lands are required in Chilaw for septage and water \ntreatment, and in Vavuniya for water supply source augmentation. Land acquisition in Chilaw \ninvolves two parcels (3 acres each) of private land. Neither have any structures nor land \nacquisition that will cause dislocation. One parcel is vacant with no productive assets. The other \nparcel  has 100  old  coconut  trees.  Each  parcel  has  a single  owner,  and  the  two  affected \nhouseholds have a total of nine affected persons. All affected persons are titled, have income \nsources that are not dependent on the land to be acquired, and none are vulnerable. Land \nacquisition  in  Vavuniya  involves  96  acres  of  paddy  fields  and  will  affect  an  estimated  39 \nfarmers. Based on the socioeconomic survey of 23 households, the average family size is four \nand the estimated number of affected persons is 156. The land is used exclusively for cultivation \nand does not have any structures. The survey identifies 15 vulnerable respondents: 6 are \nfemale household heads and 9 are elderly. Resettlement plans were prepared for the four \nproject  towns  (Supplementary  Appendix  N).  The  scope  of  identified  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement is based on the preliminary design and will be updated during detailed design. A \nguide for updating the resettlement plans has been prepared. Resettlement impacts will be \nminimized through careful siting and alignment during design and project implementation. \n \nB.  Objectives, Policy Framework, and Entitlements \n3.  This summary provides highlights of the prepared resettlement plans. The plans outline \nthe involuntary resettlement objectives and strategy for affected persons. The resettlement \nplans are based on national laws and policies: Land Acquisition Act (1950, revised in 1979) and \nthe National Involuntary Resettlement Policy (2001); and Policy on Involuntary Resettlement \n(1995) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). Core involuntary resettlement principles for the \nProject include the following: (i) Acquisition of land and other assets, and resettlement of people \nwill be minimized as much as possible by identifying possible alternative project designs and \nappropriate social, economic, operating, and engineering solutions that have the least impact on \npopulations in the project area. (ii) All project-affected people identified in the project impacted \nareas before the cut-off-date will be entitled to compensation for their lost assets, incomes, and \nbusinesses at full replacement cost; and provided with rehabilitation measures sufficient to \n                                                 \n1  Transect walks record impacts on access which will be addressed through construction management to ensure \naccess to affected persons (measures are identified in the initial environmental examination). While the transect \nwalks showed that ensuring access will also ensure no livelihood losses, a budget was estimated should the \nProject result in temporary livelihood losses during rehabilitation and laying of pipe networks, and drainage works. \nThese will be confirmed during detailed design. A compensation plan was developed for temporary livelihood \nimpacts of tank works in Puttalam, expected to affect the livelihood for one paddy season of 118 farmers and 49 \nfarm workers. The compensation plan forms part of the resettlement plan for Puttalam. \n ", "50  Appendix 12 \n \nassist in improving or at least maintaining their preproject living standards, income-earning \ncapacity, and production. (iii) All affected people will be equally eligible for compensation and \nrehabilitation assistance, irrespective of tenure status, social or economic standing, and any \nsuch factors that may discriminate against achieving previously outlined objectives. (iv) The \nrehabilitation measures to be provided are (a) cash compensation at replacement cost without \ndeduction for depreciation or salvageable materials for houses and other structures; (b) full title \nto replacement agricultural land-for-land of equal productive capacity acceptable to the affected \nperson as a priority, or cash in lieu of land at replacement value; (c) full title to replacement \nresidential and commercial land of equal size acceptable to the affected person, or cash in lieu \nof land at replacement value; (d) cash compensation for crops and trees at current market \nvalue; and (e) livelihood loss and/or restoration measures, and assistance to restore preproject \nconditions. (v) The compensation and resettlement activities will be satisfactorily completed, and \nrehabilitation measures in place before the Government and ADB will approve the award of civil \nworks contracts. (vi) The National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB, the Executing \nAgency, will make certain that institutional arrangements are in place to ensure effective and \ntimely: design, planning, consultation and disclosure, and implementation of land acquisition; \ncompensation, resettlement, and rehabilitation; and monitoring and evaluation. (vii) Adequate \nbudgetary  support  will  be  fully  committed  and  made  available  to  cover  the  costs  of  land \nacquisition,  and  resettlement  and  rehabilitation  within  the  agreed  implementation  period.  \n(viii) Special measures will be incorporated in the resettlement plans prepared and updated \nunder the Project, and complementary mitigation and enhancement activities to protect and help \nimprove  the  livelihoods  of  socially  and  economically  vulnerable  groups.  (ix)  Effective \nmechanisms for hearing and resolving grievances during implementation of the resettlement \nplan will be in place. The entitlement matrix for the Project is given in Table A12.1. \n \nC.  Consultation and Grievance Redress Participation \n4.  Consultations were held with stakeholders at various stages during project preparation \nto discuss the Project, its impacts, resettlement issues, and potential mitigation; and to involve \nthe  community  in  developing  the  resettlement  plans.  A  workshop  (71  participants)  was \nconducted during October 2007 in Anuradhapura to present and discuss resettlement and \nvarious  other  issues.  The  main  institutional  stakeholders,  civil  society,  nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs) and other local organizations were present. Semistructured face-to-face \ninterviews were conducted with a randomly selected sample of 200 people, at sites of proposed \nnetwork improvements throughout towns in Puttalam, Vavuniya, and Mannar. Views expressed \nwere  incorporated  into  the  resettlement  plans.  Public  meetings  with  farmers  were  held  in \nPuttalam and Vavuniya to discuss, in detail, the Project and its potential environmental and \nresettlement impacts and benefits. Further consultations and disclosure was undertaken in May \n2008, when resettlement planning documents were presented and summaries in local language \nwere provided. A framework for consultation and disclosure is described in the resettlement \nplans for continuing the process during implementation. The resettlement plans and other \nrelevant documents will be made available at public locations in the towns, and disclosed to a \nwider audience via the ADB website. \n \n5.  Grievances of affected persons will first be brought to the attention of the implementing \nNGO  or  resettlement  specialist.  Grievances  not  redressed  by  them  will  be  brought  to  the \ngrievance redress committee (GRC) established for each town. The GRC is chaired by the \ndivisional secretary with representatives from the municipal council, relevant local government \nagencies, regional office, community-based organizations, and NGOs. The GRC will meet every \nmonth. It will determine the merit of each grievance, and resolve grievances within 1 month of \nreceiving the complaint. The GRC will provide attested copies of the decision to the affected \n ", "  Appendix 12  51 \nperson and the regional office for the records. Affected persons who are not satisfied with the \nGRC decision can resubmit their case. The GRC will resolve the appeal within 1 month of being \ninformed of the appeal in a GRC meeting. Affected persons can refer further grievances to the \nappropriate  courts of  law.  The  regional  office  will  keep  records  of  all  grievances  received \nincluding  contact  details  of  complainant,  date  that  the  complaint  was  received,  nature  of \ngrievance, agreed corrective actions and the date these were effected, and final outcome. \n \nD.  Compensation, Relocation, and Income Restoration \n6.  Loss of land, structure, assets, trees, and crops will be at replacement cost. The land \nacquisition and resettlement committee will determine land prices and forgone incomes; and the \nregional offices will determine rental values, and the value of trees and crops based on a survey \nof market prices and consultation with agriculture and/or horticulture experts. The regional office \nwill undertake consultations with affected persons on replacement costs. Vulnerable households \nwill  be  provided  additional  assistance  in  the  form  of  land-for-land  replacement  options, \nprioritization in project employment, and transitional allowances.  \n \nE.  Institutional Framework \n7.  NWSDB,  under  the  Ministry  of  Water  Supply  and  Drainage,  will  be  the  Project\u2019s \nExecuting Agency. A project coordination cell (PCC) will be established within NWSDB head \noffice; the PCC will have a monitoring, coordination, and supervisory role. The bulk of the \nactivities  will  be  implemented  by  existing  NWSDB  regional  offices,  which  will  be  duly \nstrengthened.  Vavuniya  regional  office  will  be  responsible  for  water  supply  and  sanitation \ndevelopment works in Vavuniya and Mannar. Puttalam regional office will be responsible for \nwater supply and sanitation development works in Puttalam and Chilaw. Experienced project \nmanagers will be appointed to head project implementation units within the regional offices. A \ncore team of NWSDB employees will assist the project managers, and will include specialists in \nwater supply, sewerage and sanitation, procurement, environment, finance and accounting, and \nsocial and community development. They will be supported by a project design, supervision, \nand management consulting team. A national project implementation coordination committee \nwill be established to oversee the Project. Provincial project coordination committees will be \nestablished in North and Northwestern provinces to provide provincial coordination and oversee \nprogress in urban sanitation, tank rehabilitation, and water resource management activities. \n \n8.  The  PCC  will  ensure  consistency  across  all  project  components  and  coordinate \nresettlement issues. Domestic resettlement specialists, as part of the design, supervision, and \nmanagement  consulting  team,  will  be  appointed  to  each  regional  office.  The  resettlement \nspecialist  will  update  and  implement  resettlement  plans,  and  work  in  the  regional  office \nthroughout the detailed design stage and intermittently thereafter. An implementing NGO with \nresettlement experience will be appointed and will provide two staff in each regional office to \nimplement the resettlement plans, liaise with affected persons regarding their entitlements, \nassist in identifying vulnerable households, and disburse compensation payments to affected \npersons. Details on agencies responsible for resettlement plan activities are in Table A12.2.  \n \nF.  Resettlement Budget, Financing, and Implementation Schedule \n9.  The detailed budget estimates are in the resettlement plans, which NWSDB will include \nin the project cost estimate. The budget will include (i) detailed costs of land acquisition and \nresettlement assistance, (ii) source of funding, (iii) arrangements for approval, and (iv) the flow \nof funds and contingency arrangements. NWSDB will provide all land acquisition funds. Overall \ncosts are estimated at SLRs84.31 million. All land acquisition and resettlement assistance will \nbe an integral component of project costs.

The Dry Zone Urban Water and Sanitation Project will facilitate sustainable development \nin disadvantaged districts in Sri Lanka, by investing in priority water supply and sanitation \ninfrastructure in urban areas in Chilaw, Mannar, , Puttalam, and Vavuniya. \n \n2.  The Project will be implemented over 5 years beginning in early 2009, supported by the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) through a project loan and grant. The National Water Supply \nand  Drainage  Board  (NWSDB),  under  the  Ministry  of  Water  Supply  and  Drainage,  is  the \nExecuting Agency. ADB classifies the Project as environmental assessment category B, as the \nVavuniya water supply subproject includes one environmentally sensitive component (a 4 meter \nhigh dam and 215 hectare storage reservoir). The impacts of providing infrastructure were \nassessed by four initial environmental examination (IEE) reports (one for each location). An \nenvironmental  management  plan  for  the  storage  reservoir  in  Vavuniya  and  four  detailed \nenvironmental monitoring plans for the other less sensitive subcomponents in Vavuniya and \nsubprojects in the other three towns were prepared. Studies were conducted according to ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment  Policy  (2002)  and  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines  (2003).  NWSDB  will \nsubmit project information to the Central Environmental Authority (for Vavuniya and Mannar), \nand the North Western Provincial Environmental Authority (Puttalam and Chilaw), to initiate \nobtaining  the  necessary  environmental  clearances  required  by  Government  of  Sri  Lanka \nlegislation. \n \nA.  Description of the Project \n3.  The proposed infrastructure varies in composition as each area has different needs, but \nimprovements in a particular sector generally contain the same basic elements: \n \n(i)  Urban water supply: (a) source augmentation: increased abstraction of surface \nwater or groundwater; (b) more efficient transfer: transmission main, pumping \nstations; (c) improved treatment: new or refurbished water treatment plant or \nincreased chlorination; (d) increased storage: ground storage tanks, overhead \nreservoirs;  and  (e)  improved  or  extended  distribution:  distribution  main  and \nnetwork. \n \n(ii)  Urban sanitation: (a) new pit latrines with septic tanks and soakage pits or only \nsoakage pits in plots with space constraints; (b) improved emptying of septic \ntanks: new vacuum tanker vehicles; and (c) septage treatment: facility to dry \nsludge and treat liquid effluent.  \n \n4.  Table A13.1 shows the location, size, and dimensions of all elements of the proposed \ninfrastructure, and Table A13.2 summarizes the likely approach to construction of each element \nand operation of each scheme. All infrastructure will be designed during a 6-month detailed \ndesign stage in 2008, and built during a 4-year construction period (2009\u20132012). \n \nTable A13.1: Details and Dimensions of the Proposed Infrastructure \nUrban Subprojects  Mannar  Vavuniya  Puttalam  Chilaw \nRehabilitate tubewells (number)  4  4     \nNew tubewells (number; depth)  4; 20 m  6; 20 m    7; 20 m \nNew earth bund (length; crest height)    1.5 km; 4 m     \nReservoir (capacity; area at FSL)     3.7 million m3;      \n215 ha \nIntake well (diameter; depth)    5 m; 5 m; RCC  6 m; 6 m; RCC   \n ", "56   Appendix 13 \nUrban Subprojects  Mannar  Vavuniya  Puttalam  Chilaw \nRehabilitate weir across river      Replace sluice   \ngates \nIrrigation tanks: remove silt and      2 tanks; 1 canal   \nplants \nNew intake canals (height, width,      5 m; 5 m;   2.4 m; 10 m; \nlength)  1.5 km earth  40 m; RCC \n5 m; 5 m;  \n1.9 km earth \nNew weir in river (length; crest        50 m; 1.5 m; \nheight)  RCC \nRaw water pump house (number of      3  6 \npumps) \nRaw water transmission main  32.9 km;   1.6 km; 400 mm  300 m; 500 mm  4.4 km;  \n50\u2013450 mm  400 mm \nRefurbish water treatment plant      (cid:57)  (cid:57) \nTank to mix treated and    Existing OR  Existing tank  Existing \ngroundwater  2,000 m3 \ntank \nNew WTP (area)    0.8 ha; RCC  2 ha: RCC tanks  1.2 ha;  \ntanks  RCC tanks  \nTreated water pump house (number    4     \nof pumps) \nChlorine injection units (number)  3       \nTreated water transmission main  10 km; 160\u2013355  15.5km; 350\u2013 33 km; 400 mm  22.5 km; \nmm  450 mm  300\u2013400 mm\nTreated water ground storage tank  1 tank; 500 m3  1 tank; 2,500 m3  2 tanks; 2,000 m3  1 tank;  \n500 m3 \nPump station (number; number of    4 stations; 2     \npumps)  pumps \nOverhead reservoir (number;  1; 900 m3  3; 1000, 1500,  1; 1500 m3  2; 750 m3, \ncapacity)  300 m3  900 m3 \nDistribution main (length; diameter)  15.4 km; 110\u2013280  41 km; 110\u2013400  28.5 km; 200\u2013400  29 km; 160\u2013\nmm  mm  mm  400 mm \nDistribution pipes (length; diameter)  75 km; 63\u2013160  95 km; 90\u2013160  64 km; 90\u2013300  108 km; 90\u2013\nmm  mm  mm  225 mm \nHousehold latrines (number)  500  500  500  500 \nVacuum tanker vehicle (number;  1; 3,000 liters  2; 3,000 liters  2; 3,000 liters  1; 3,000 liters\ncapacity) \nSeptage treatment (area; number of  0.75 ha;   1 ha  1 ha  0.75 ha \nponds: thickening; sludge drying;  2T; 6D; 2ET; 1RB  3T; 12D; 3ET;  3T; 10D; 2ET; 1RB 3T; 8D; 2ET; \neffluent treatment; reed-bed)  1RB  1RB \nD = drying beds, ET = effluent treatment, FSL = full supply level, ha = hectare, km = kilometer, m = meter, mm = \nmillimeter, OR = overhead reservoir, RB =reed beds, RCC = reinforced concrete , T = thickening , WTP = water treatment \nplant. \nSources: Initial Environmental Examination for the towns of Chilaw, Mannar, Puttalam and Vavuniya. \n \nB.  Description of the Environment \n \nTable A13.2: Main Environmental Features of the Four Study Towns \n \nParameter  Details \nLocation  Chilaw, Puttalam, and Mannar are towns on the west coast of Sri Lanka; 70, 130, and 220 \nkm, respectively, north of the national capital Colombo; Vavuniya is 50 km east of Mannar. \n \n ", "                  Appendix 13  57\nParameter  Details \nTopography,  The coastal towns and villages (Chilaw, Puttalam, and Mannar) are flat with sandy soils \nSoil, Geology  and are in a narrow Miocene to Quaternary belt of ferruginized gravels and alluvium over \nMiocene bedrock. Vavuniya is in the Precambrian Vanni complex of granitic gneiss and \nbiotite that runs diagonally across the country. Soils here are mainly the more fertile \nreddish brown earth and the topography is gently undulating. \nClimate  Chilaw is in the intermediate rainfall zone with an average of 1,500\u20132,000 mm of rain per \nyear. The other towns and villages are in the low rainfall zone and receive 500\u20131,500 mm \nper year only. About 40%\u201350% of the rain falls in October\u2013November and 20%\u201330% \nduring April\u2013May. Temperatures reach daily averages of around 30\u00b0C in May\u2013August and \nfall to around 25\u00b0C in December\u2013January, dropping by around 5\u201310\u00b0C at night. Humidity \nis high, often >80%. \nAir Quality  Few data are available, but air quality is likely to be good because of the lack of heavy \nindustry and dispersion by coastal winds. Particulate matter will increase during the dry \nseason and soot may increase when vegetation is burned. \nSurface Water  Chilaw and Puttalam are in the drainage basins of the Dedru Oya and Kala Oya (rivers), \nwhich drain to the west coast; and Vavuniya is in the basin of the Malwatha Oya. Most \nareas have many tanks (large reservoirs built by constructing earth bunds across rivers or \nin low-lying areas), from where water flows into irrigation channels. Giant\u2019s Tank near \nMannar is the second largest in the country. \nGroundwater  Groundwater is contained in alluvial deposits and ferruginous gravels in Chilaw and \nPuttalam, and is exploited by private and public wells and by NWSDB to supply water to \nthe towns. A large aquifer in Miocene limestone near Mannar is also exploited, and \nperched surface aquifers on the island. No data is available on the extent or yield of the \naquifers or the quality of the water. Vavuniya has no major aquifers but some groundwater \nis present. \nEcology  Vegetation has been removed from the inhabited areas and their surroundings to provide \nland for development and agriculture. Vegetation now consists of crops and fruit trees; \nanimals are those able to live close to man. Irrigation tanks support aquatic plants and \nanimals, and Chilaw and Puttalam lagoons are wetland habitats. Some riverine forest is \nalong rivers, but the only protected area is Wilpattu National Park nexr to the Kala Oya. \nLand Use  Most  land  in  the  urban  areas  is  developed  for  housing,  shops,  small  industry,  and \ngovernment offices; outside the land is mainly used for agriculture. In rural areas land is \nmainly used for housing and agriculture. \nIndustry and  The only large industries are Holcim Cement and coastal salt pans at Puttalam, where a \nAgriculture  100 megawatt coal power plant is being built. Most other industry is small, including light \nengineering, garment manufacture, and brickworks. Farming is mainly paddy rice (irrigated \nand rain-fed) plus maize, vegetables, livestock. There are also coastal fisheries.  \nInfrastructure  All target towns have a piped water supply based on groundwater, but water is only \navailable for a few hours a day because of inefficient tuber wells and leaking networks. \nWith no sewerage, people rely on septic tanks or pit latrines, and many households have \nno toilet. Open concrete drains run beside roads in towns, but most are blocked with silt \nand garbage. Solid waste is collected and dumped on land outside the towns as there are \nno landfills. Most people in towns and some in villages have electricity from the national \ngrid. \nTransportation  All  towns  are  at  junctions  of  main  highways  and  have  good  road  connections  to \nneighboring towns and districts. Roads in the center of towns are generally congested. \nPublic buses and motorcycles are the main transport. Chilaw, Puttalam, and Vavuniya are \non the railway from Colombo, but at Mannar the track was destroyed some years ago by \nthe LTTE (Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam). Villages are reached by unpaved roads from \nthe nearest highway. \nDemography  With the exception of Chilaw, the towns are affected in varying degrees by the conflict \nbetween Government and the LTTE who wish to establish an autonomous Tamil state in \nthe north. People (particularly Muslims) have moved from Mannar and other towns in the \nLTTE controlled area to safer areas in the south where many live in camps for internally \ndisplaced persons. The main religious and ethnic groups are Christian in Chilaw, Muslim \n ", "58   Appendix 13 \nParameter  Details \nin Puttalam, Tamil and Christian in Mannar, and Tamil and Hindu in Vavuniya. \nSocioeconomic  Unemployment is >30% in all of the target towns and villages. Those employed are mainly \nin agriculture and fishing, business and trading, government, and the private sector. A high \nproportion  of  families  own  their  own  houses,  although  the  condition  of  buildings  is \ngenerally poor and many houses are empty in Mannar. Significant numbers of families \nreceive government assistance from the Samurdhi poverty reduction program. \nHealth and  Health and education facilities are more numerous and better equipped in towns than rural \nEducation  areas, but Mannar is less well provided for than the other target towns. Each town has a \nbase hospital and public and private clinics, but only the larger villages have clinics. The \ntowns (except Mannar) have reasonably good preschools and primary and junior schools, \nbut fewer schools and colleges offering general certificate in education and higher level \nteaching. Pupil teacher ratios are good, at 25\u201330:1. \nHistory,  Nongovernment  and  community-based  organizations  operate  in  all  towns  and  some \nCulture, and  villages, dealing particularly with displacement and other social issues. Most villages have \nTourism  death donation societies (which help bereaved families), farmers\u2019 associations, women\u2019s \ngroups. Culturally important buildings in towns and villages are mainly associated with the \nreligions: temples, churches, and mosques; tourism is not significant and none of the \nrequisite infrastructure (hotels, resorts) is in place.  \nkm = kilometer, mm = millimeter, NWSDB = National Water Supply and Drainage Board.  \nSources: Project preparatory studies. \n \nC.  Forecasting Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \n5.  Most of the minor negative impacts associated with the Project will be typical to those \nfound in any construction project and could be mitigated by adopting good construction and \noperating practices. This section summarizes project-specific impacts, the generic impacts are \ndiscussed in detail in the four IEEs and the combined summary. \n \n6.  Main concerns related to the siting of septage treatment facilities are impacts due to odor \nand effluent discharge. Sites selected are away from communities, so nuisances from odor will \nbe minimized. In two of the towns the treated effluent is proposed to be discharged to either \ncoastal or lagoon waters. The users of such water may be concerned of (i) potential risks to \nhealth and livelihood, and (ii) impacts to receiving waters due to discharge of partially treated \neffluent resulting from system malfunctions. Although impacts are expected to be minimal, given \nthe saline nature of the waters not conducive to commonly found bacteria, mitigation measures \ninclude (i) engaging users in the effluent discharge zone in consultations to explain the scheme; \n(ii) periodic monitoring of effluent and receiving water quality; and (iii) inclusion of emergency \nprocedures in the operation and maintenance manuals, if discharge standards are exceeded. \nThese will include (i) shutting off discharge and recycling the effluent, (ii) investigating reasons \nfor failure and adopting remedial actions, and (iii) resuming discharge only when standards are \nmet.  \n \n7.  Although impacts related to design of water supply systems are expected to be minor, \nsome uncertainties are still present at the stage of feasibility and additional data regarding the \nyield of the aquifer will be needed prior to finalizing detailed design. Therefore, at this stage, a \nprogram of borehole monitoring will be conducted to determine the extent, yield, and rate of \nrecharge of the aquifer, groundwater quality, and quality of proposed surface water sources. \nThis data will be used to (i) determine the location and sustainable extraction rates of the \ntubewells, (ii) redesign by selecting alternative water sources if proposed abstraction rates \nexceed sustainable yield, (iii) assess if proposed treatment and mixing will produce water of \nrequired quality, and (iv) redesign the treatment system if studies indicate more treatment is \nrequired. Additional water quality data is being collected for some proposed sources. In those \n ", "                  Appendix 13  59\nschemes where treated surface water will be mixed with the groundwater, final quality of the \nwater delivered to the end user will need to be tested to ensure that it meets drinking water \nstandards.  \n \n8.  The subproject warranting more attention is the construction of a 4 meter high, 1.5 km \nlong earth bund across the Per Aru in Vavuniya to impound 3.7 million m3 of water in an area of \n215 hectares to provide a year-round supply. A fraction of the area is already used to store \nwater. The Per Aru is a perennial relatively small stream and does not contain any important \naquatic habitats or fisheries. Therefore the subproject will not have any significant ecological \nimpacts. Presently, during monsoons, the Per Aru floods almost up to the proposed full supply \nlevel of the reservoir. Most of the vegetation, which includes secondary scrub and close cropped \ngrass, will be removed from the drawdown area, to reduce generation of high concentrations of \nnitrate,  phosphate,  and  organic  matter  resulting  from  decomposing  organic  matter  in  the \nimpounded waters. Small areas of primary riverine forests and around 38 hectares of paddy \nfarming land will be inundated. Available information indicates that no water users are located \ndownstream. Several studies including (i) the extent and species of primary riverine forest, (ii) \ndetailed hydrogeological studies of flow rates in the river, (iii) verified ecological calculations of \nminimum  flow  required  to  maintain  existing  riverine  forest  downstream  and  to  support  an \nadditional area equivalent to that lost upstream, and (iv) identification of suitable areas to be \nplanted downstream and preparation of planting and maintenance plan for the new habitat, are \nproposed prior to initiating work on the reservoir. The new area of riverine forest will be planted \nbefore  the  reservoir  is  filled.  The  construction  of  the  reservoir  will  not  result  in  relocating \ncommunities, however, alternative land and/or compensation will be provided, for the loss of 38 \nhectares of paddy farms, in line with ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). One of the \npositive features of impounding surface water is that the aquifers in this area will recharge more \nreadily from water that percolates to the ground from the bed of the reservoir. \n \n9.  Other than these impacts, construction of infrastructure is not expected to have major \nadverse impacts because \n(i)  most network improvements will be on unused ground alongside roads and can \nbe  built  without  causing  major  disruption  to  road  users,  houses,  shops,  and \nbusinesses; \n(ii)  most  new  facilities  (overhead  reservoir,  PH,  WTP,  STF)  will  be  located  on \ngovernment-owned land that is not occupied or used for any other purpose; \n(iii)  most network construction will be conducted by small teams working on short \nlengths at a time so most impacts will be localized and short in duration; and \n(iv)  the construction program will be relatively short for a project of this nature, and \nshould be completed in 3\u20134 years in the towns. \n \n10.  The schemes should operate without major negative impacts because \n(i)  schemes are designed to use simple technologies with low maintenance and little \nreplacement of parts to enhance their long-term sustainability; and \n(ii)  providing the responsible agency ensures that infrastructure is inspected regularly \nand maintained as required, repairs should be small-scale and short in duration. \n \nD.  Institutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Plan \n11.  Detailed  environmental  monitoring  plans  for  all  activities  in  the  four  towns  and  an \nenvironmental  management  plan  for  the  construction  of  the  reservoir  are  included  in  the \nindividual IEEs. Environmental plans will be implemented and coordinated by an environment \nspecialist attached to the project regional offices.  \n ", "60   Appendix 13 \nE.  Public Consultation and Information Disclosure \n12.  Primary stakeholders (residents, shopkeepers, and business people who live and work \nnear the construction sites; and owners and users of any land that is acquired for the Project) \nand  secondary  stakeholders  (NWSDB,  other  relevant  government  institutions,  NGOs  and \ncommunity-based  organizations  working  in  the  affected  communities;  other  community \nrepresentatives) were consulted in developing the IEEs through face-to-face discussions on-site \nand large public meetings held in December 2007 and January 2008. Views and concerns were \nincorporated into the IEEs and the planning and development of the Project. The IEEs were \nmade available in the local language at public locations in the towns and the summary initial \nenvironmental examination will be disclosed to a wider audience via the ADB website. NWSDB \nwill appoint a nationally recognized NGO to handle consultation during project implementation to \nensure full participation of stakeholders in subproject execution. \n \nF.  Findings and Recommendations \n13.  Environmental  issues  were  considered  throughout  development  of  the  Project  and \nnecessary changes made to outline designs to reduce or avoid impacts. Mitigation measures for \nother impacts are provided in detail in the individual IEEs. Once the schemes are built, most \nshould operate without major environmental impacts, providing the relevant agencies follow \noperation  and  maintenance  procedures  prepared  during  the  design  stage.  The  Project  will \nprovide the agencies with training, and budgets to enable them to fulfill these responsibilities. \n \n14.  Some uncertainties relate to the impact analysis of operating some of the water supply \nschemes, and additional data will be collected to ensure sustainability and prevent any negative \nimpacts. A range of studies (para. 7) will be conducted during the detailed design stage to \nensure that abstraction is conducted only at sustainable amounts and that proposed treatment \nmethods will deliver water meeting required standards. If the studies show that water cannot be \nabstracted  sustainably  by  methods  proposed,  subprojects  will  be  revised  accommodating \nalternative sources and/or treatment. Precautions are also needed at the septage treatment \nfacilities, to protect the health of workers and the users of water into which treated effluent is \ndischarged. Manuals and training will be provided for this purpose. \n \n15.  If water is abstracted sustainably and treated to the mandatory standards, then the \ncitizens of the towns and villages should benefit substantially as they will be provided with a \nconstant supply of good quality water and an improved sanitation service. Their quality of life \nshould  therefore  improve  significantly.  The  Project  will  conduct  a  program  to  raise  public \nawareness of sanitation and hygiene issues so the health of the community should also improve. \n \nG.  Conclusions \n16.  The environmental impacts of the Project were assessed by the IEE studies summarized \nin this document, conducted according to ADB policy and procedures. Many impacts will be \navoided by action during project development, and the IEEs describe further action that will be \ntaken during detailed design, construction, and operation. \n \n17.  Most impacts identified by this analysis should be reduced to acceptable levels by the \nmitigation proposed. However final conclusions regarding the impacts of the schemes as a \nwhole cannot be determined because of uncertainties regarding the impacts of operating the \nwater supply components. This should be possible once the studies described in paragraphs 7 \nand 8 are completed. The environmental monitoring plans and the environmental management \nplan will be updated during the detailed design stage. \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20081105102839+08'00'", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Keywords": "rrp: sri 37381, sri, sri lanka, dry zone urban water, sri lanka water sanitation project, urban water sanitation project, sri lanka  urban water", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 7.0 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20081202161404+08'00'", "Title": "Dry Zone Urban Water and Sanitation Project"}, "author_page": "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 28 October 2008) \n \nCurrency Unit \u2013  Sri Lanka rupee/s (SLRe/SLRs) \n \nSLRe1.00 =  $0.009259 \n$1.00 =  SLRs108.00 \n \nABBREVIATIONS \n \n  ADB  \u2013  Asian Development Bank \n  ADF  \u2013  Asian Development Fund \n  CBO  \u2013  community-based organization \n  EMP  \u2013  environmental management plan \n  ICB  \u2013  international competitive biding \n  IEE  \u2013  initial environmental examination \n  MDG  \u2013  Millennium Development Goal \n  NCB  \u2013  national competitive biding \n  NGO  \u2013  nongovernment organization \n  NRW  \u2013  nonrevenue water \n  NWSDB  \u2013  National Water Supply and Drainage Board \n  O&M  \u2013  operation and maintenance \n  PCC  \u2013  project coordination cell \n  PICC  \u2013  project implementation coordination committee \n  WRB  \u2013  Water Resources Board \n \nGLOSSARY \n \n  Dry zone  \u2013  Southeast, east, and northern parts of Sri Lanka, which receive \nbetween 1,200 and 1,900 millimeters of rain annually \n  Pradeshiya sabha  \u2013  Smallest political unit in periurban and rural areas  \n  Tank  \u2013  Reservoirs of various sizes but generally relatively shallow \n \nNOTES \n \n(i)  The fiscal year of the Government of Sri Lanka and its agencies ends on \n31 December.  \n(ii)  In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \nVice-President  X.
