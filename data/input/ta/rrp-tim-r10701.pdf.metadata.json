Consequently, three quarters of the population fled\ntheir homes and most of the country\u2019s infrastructure and public\nbuildings  together  with  thousands  of  private  homes  and\nbusinesses were destroyed. The upheaval was accompanied by\nlooting, burning, and damage to town and village water supplies\nand sanitation facilities throughout the country. In towns with\npublic water supply systems, vehicles, pumps, and motors were\nremoved; water treatment plants damaged; offices, stores, and\nother buildings burned; pipelines, tools, and spare parts stolen;\nstorage  tanks  ruptured;  and  water  sources  impaired.  The\nburning  of  houses  completely  destroyed  water  connections,\nincluding meters, and latrines and septic tanks were damaged\nwith  part  of  the  house  structure.  None  of  the  former  water\nsupply  or  sanitation  institutions  remained.  The  ongoing  first\nWater Supply and Sanitation Rehabilitation Project (WSSRP-1),\nwhich was approved on 4 August 2000 and commenced on 1\nSeptember  2000,  supports  physical  repair  and  rehabilitation,\nand  establishes  new  institutions  and  systems  for  managing,\noperating, maintaining, and further developing urban and rural\nwater  supplies  that  are  both  appropriate  and  sustainable.\nWSSRP-1's completion is expected on 30 June 2001.\nThe remaining challenges are significant. The capacity of the\nWater and Sanitation Service (WSS) to plan, develop, operate,\nand  maintain  water  supply  and  sanitation  (WS&S)  systems\nrequires  development  and  training.  While  repair  and\nrehabilitation of existing water supply systems in Dili and the\ndistrict capital towns under the WSSRP-1 have commenced,\nWS&S coverage remains below developing country targets and\nservice coverage improvement in the whole of East Timor will\nrequire additional sector activities over the coming years.\nProject Description The Project (Water Supply and Sanitation Rehabilitation Project,\nPhase II) will (i) extend the operation of the project management\nunit (PMU) established under the United Nations Transitional\nAdministration in East Timor's (UNTAET's) WSS; (ii) continue\nthe capacity building and institutional development program to\nconduct  training  in  priority  areas,  assist  in  key  policy\ndevelopment initiatives, and strengthen the capacity of WSS to\ncoordinate the overall development assistance for the sector;\n(iii) undertake priority WS&S implementation that will include (a)\na  WS&S  quick  response  facility,  (b)  Dili  water  supply\nrehabilitation  and  improvement;  (c)  district  water  supply\nrehabilitation  and  improvement;  (d)  community  WS&S\nrehabilitation and improvement; (e) extension of limited initial\nworks to improve deteriorating urban sanitation infrastructure\nand  services\u2013particularly  in  Dili\u2013focusing  on  drainage,  solid", "iii\nwaste, and human waste management. The works under (ii)\nand  (iii)  will  complement  activities  being  planned  by  other\ndonors or are already under way.\nThe  Project  is  in  environmental  category  B.  An  initial\nenvironmental examination was undertaken, and its summary is\na core appendix.\nBeneficiaries The Project is expected to directly or indirectly benefit a large\npart  of  the  country's  800,000  population.  It  will  generate\nemployment for local labor, and help to create a stable social\nand economic environment.\nThe Project is designed to distribute benefits in an equitable\nmanner  across  East  Timorese  urban  and  rural  communities,\nand  thus  contribute  to  (i)  sustainable  development  and\noperation in the WS&S sector, and (ii) poverty reduction.\nExecuting Agency UNTAET will administer the grant from the Trust Fund for East\nTimor (TFET) on behalf of East Timor. UNTAET will establish a\nPMU  within  WSS  that  reports  to  the  UNTAET  Infrastructure\nCabinet  Member  through  the  head  of  WSS.  The  PMU  will\nprogram, administer, and coordinate daily project activities and\nwill assume the role of an Executing Agency. UNTAET will also\nestablish a project steering committee with broad stakeholder\nrepresentation.\nCost Estimates and The  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  $4.50  million\nFinancing Plan equivalent. The Project will be entirely financed on a grant basis\nfrom the TFET. The funds have been committed by donors;\nhowever,  contributions  to  the  TFET  do  not  include  Asian\nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  resources.  The  International\nDevelopment Association (IDA) of the World Bank Group is the\ntrustee of the TFET. IDA and ADB are responsible for jointly\nmanaging the TFET funds.\nPeriod of Utilization Until 30 April 2003\nEstimated Project\nCompletion Date 30 October 2002\nProcurement All  procurement  under  the  Project  will  be  conducted  in\naccordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  The\nproceeds  of  the  Project  will  finance  imports  of  goods  and\nservices, local purchases, and civil works identified under the\nProject. Under ADB's guidelines, the items may be procured off\nthe shelf (direct purchase), or through international shopping or\nlocal  or  international  competitive  bidding,  as  appropriate.\nConsultants will be procured and engaged from ADB member\ncountries, East Timor, and all other donors and members of", "iv\norganizations that have contributed to the TFET.\nThe  PMU  will  require  international  consulting  services.  The\nconsultants  will  be  selected  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements\nsatisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants.\nSocial Issues and The  Project  will  rehabilitate  and  improve  water  supply  and\nPoverty sanitation services. An initial social assessment of the Project\nwas  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB's Guidelines for\nIncorporation of Social Dimensions in Bank Operations,  and\ndrew substantially on the initial social assessment prepared for\nWSSRP-1.\nThe Project is expected to have a significant positive social\nimpact. The social benefits will include (i) providing the means\nfor improved water supply and sanitation, and (ii) upgrading the\nquality of life for people in both urban and rural areas whose\nattempts  to  improve  their  status  and  health  are  continually\nimpeded  by  the  need  to  divert  time,  energy,  and  financial\nresources to acquire their daily water needs. In addition, the\nProject will generate employment for local labor and thus help to\ncreate a stable social and economic environment. The Project\nwill  be  responsive  to  communities\u2019  needs,  contribute  to\nsustainable and participatory development and operation in the\nWS&S  sector,  reduce  poverty,  and  minimize  environmental\nimpacts.\nThe  Project  will  involve  no  relocation  or  resettlement.  Land\nacquisition will be minimal, with the majority of facilities being\nconstructed on public land or rights-of-way.\nEnvironmental Issues An initial environmental examination (IEE) was carried out in\naccordance  with  ADB's  Environmental  Assessment\nRequirements, drawing substantially on the IEE prepared for\nWSSRP-1. The Project\u2019s environmental impact is classified as\ncategory  B.  Its  potential  impacts  could  be  mitigated  using\nestablished  procedures.  A  detailed  environmental  impact\nassessment is not required. The Project will generally have a\npositive  environmental  impact,  with  minor  adverse  impacts\nbeing related to construction activities, which are short term and\nconfined.\nAn environmental specialist will assist the PMU in ensuring that\nappropriate environmental mitigation measures are applied in\nimplementing project activities and that appropriate monitoring\nand reporting are carried out by the PMU.", "v", "I.  THE PROJECT\n1. I submit for your information the following report on a project grant to East Timor, as\nadministered by the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET), from\nthe Trust Fund for East Timor (TFET), for the Water Supply and Sanitation Rehabilitation\nProject - Phase II.1 The project framework is in Appendix 1.\nII.  INTRODUCTION\n2. UNTAET, in consultation with the East Timor Transitional Administration (ETTA), the\nNational Council of East Timor, and members of East Timor's civil society, has asked the Asian\nDevelopment Bank (ADB), through the TFET, to provide further assistance in rehabilitating and\nrestoring the damaged and inadequate water supply and sanitation infrastructure throughout\nEast Timor, and concurrently to reestablish the human and institutional capacity needed to\nmanage,  operate,  and  maintain  the  facilities.  An  ADB  Mission2  prepared  a  Project  with\nauthorized  UNTAET/ETTA  representatives.  The  agreements  reached  were  confirmed  in  a\nmemorandum  of  understanding.  The  Project  was  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  Joint\nManagement Arrangements for the Trust Fund for East Timor.3 The TFET does not include\nADB's own resources.\nIII.  BACKGROUND\nA.  Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Description\n3. The water supply and sanitation (WS&S) sector status is summarized in the following\nparagraphs. Additional details are in Appendix 2.\n1.  Current Status\na.  Institutional Arrangements\n4. The Water and Sanitation Service (WSS) of UNTAET has been established and is\noperating. WSS now has staff in all districts, is managing 13 public water supply systems in Dili\nand the other district capitals, and through the first Water Supply and Sanitation Rehabilitation\nProject  (WSSRP-1)  and  other  external  support  has  commenced  the  essential  policy\ndevelopment and institutional capacity building required to develop its capacity to deliver WS&S\nservices.  The  strategic  plan  for  WSS  (Appendix  3)  requires  WSS  to  assume  broad\nresponsibilities  for  the  delivery  of  WS&S  services  including  water  policy/water  resource\nmanagement, water supply, sanitation, solid waste, and drainage. Under the pre-independence\nadministration,  these  functions  were  fragmented  across  several  ministries  and  levels  of\ngovernment.\n5. WSS  is  a  newly  formed  agency,  which  is  just  developing  its  staff,  institutional\ninfrastructure,  policies  and  legislation,  and  operational  and  management  systems.  WSS\nrequires significant capacity building. Sector rehabilitation activities are being undertaken in an\n                  \n1 The Project first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 2 March 2001.\n2 The Mission comprised W.

The organization will play a key role in coordinating the wide range of donor activities for\nthe sector, but flexibility in planning and implementation is needed in the developing institutional\nenvironment.\nb.  Water Supply\n6. Under  the  pre-independence  administration,  the  quality  of  the  public  water  supply\nsystems was problematic with many of them poorly planned, designed, and operated. Typical\ndeficiencies  were  low  service  coverage,  poor  maintenance,  high  levels  of  unaccounted-for\nwater, intermittent supply, inappropriate treatment systems, poor water quality particularly from\nsurface water sources during the wet season, and frequent failure due to flood and landslide\ndamage to transmission pipelines. Service coverage4 in the piped systems was low (39 percent\nin district capitals and 29 percent in subdistrict towns). Private shallow wells were extensively\nused in the urban areas in Dili and other towns.\n7. Villages and rural areas not served by the public water supply systems had extensive\ncommunity-owned and -operated piped systems. Some of these received water from public\nsystems and others sourced water from small springs or streams. Shallow wells were also\nextensively used in villages and rural areas, especially those near the sea or on river plains. It\nwas estimated that 48 percent of the total population of East Timor had access to safe water.5\n8. A summary of key impacts of the violence on water supply follows. (i) The institutions\nresponsible  for  water  supply  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  ceased  to  exist  after  the\nIndonesian withdrawal. While many of the technical and administrative support staff were East\nTimorese, the majority of the management and professional staff of the PDAM/BPAMs (local\ngovernment  water  enterprise/district  water  board)  were  Indonesians  whose  departure  had\nsignificant implications for human resource capacity. Many technical staff from the former water\nenterprises have assisted in the process of restoring supplies. (ii) The institutional infrastructure\nincluding  buildings  and  other  assets,  technical  and  financial  records,  vehicles,  tools,  and\nequipment were either stolen or destroyed. (iii) Consumer connections were generally destroyed\nwith the widespread destruction of the houses that they served. (iv) The large numbers of\ndisplaced persons that have moved into the urban areas, particularly in Dili, caused further\ndamage and physical damage to pipes as they attempt to access water supply through illegal\nconnection. (v) Damage to major installations, such as treatment plants, was limited. Some\nbores were destroyed and pumps and/or electrical switchboards removed. In some instances,\nbore casings were filled with rocks. (vi) Power supplies were damaged, significantly affecting\npumped systems, especially in the early period after the Indonesian withdrawal. Anecdotal\ninformation indicates that damage to rural supplies was not extensive. However, there were\npockets of damage that showed contamination of sources such as shallow wells.\n9. Since the destruction in September 1999, there has been significant progress with both\nemergency  system  repairs  and  with  planning  for  more  substantial  rehabilitation  and\naugmentation (paras. 34 to 43). The public water supplies in each of the district capitals are\noperating and providing supplies of equivalent or better standard.\n                  \n4 Service coverage is defined as the percentage of the population receiving water supply services within the service\narea of the piped network.\n5 UNDP. 1998. Common Country Assessment; DiKesTk. I; Health Profile.", "3\n10. However, service coverage and the standards of service delivery before September\n1999 had been poor (48 percent compared with 73 percent in Indonesia as a whole). While the\nemergency phase and subsequent activities have made considerable progress in rehabilitating\nand  repairing  the  immediate  damage  caused  by  the  postconsultation  violence,  significant\ninvestment in additional improvements in both urban and rural water supply systems is needed\nto extend the coverage to an acceptable level and to improve service levels.\nc.  Sanitation\n11. Sanitation coverage before independence was estimated at 38 percent (footnote 5).\nDamage to sanitation facilities occurred as houses were destroyed. In addition, facilities to\nmaintain and desludge septic tanks were destroyed. As a consequence, access to higher order\nsanitation systems in the urban areas decreased. The damage to water supplies also impacted\non water availability and use for sanitation. Anecdotal evidence indicates limited impact on\nsanitation systems in rural areas. Some facilities have been implemented, particularly in Dili, to\naccommodate the additional demands created by the influx of UNTAET and peacekeeping\nforces (PKF) personnel.\n12. While  the  initial  emergency  phase  rehabilitation  activities  focused  on  water  supply,\ndonors and NGOs are now expanding their activities to incorporate integrated programs for\nWS&S,  which  include  community  education  and  hygiene  promotion  aimed  at  improving\nenvironmental  sanitation  through  community  participatory  approaches.  Similar  activities  are\nbeing undertaken under WSSRP-1 through nongovernment organizations (NGOs) in Dili and\nseveral district towns.\nd.  Solid Waste\n13. Before independence, most towns had a solid waste collection system in which waste\nwas deposited in strategically located collection boxes. The capacity of the collection systems\nwas grossly inadequate and wastes were indiscriminately dumped in drains and on roadsides.\nThe operation of solid waste disposal sites was questionable. Significant quantities of waste\nwere disposed of by burning. There was no solid waste management system in Dili after the\nIndonesian withdrawal. Previous systems involved both community and institutional participation\nin solid waste collection, cartage and disposal. But equipment (handcarts and trucks) used for\ncollection  and  transport  were  either  destroyed,  diverted  to  other  uses,  or  removed.  The\nprovincial sanitation office (Dinas Kebersihan) within the former Dili city administration no longer\nexists. Markets were destroyed, and solid waste is generated from informal markets that have\nestablished on roadsides. The equipment previously used in the solid waste collection systems\nin  other  district  towns  was  either  destroyed  or  removed.  The  community  and  institutional\nsystems for collection and disposal are no longer operating.\n14. The large expatriate presence has a significant impact on the generation of solid waste\u2013\nbottled water containers, soft drinks and beer cans\u2013and a general increase in the importation of\nconsumer goods. These problems are particularly apparent in Dili. The general destruction has\ncreated significant additional quantities of solid waste including building rubble, roofing material,\ncar bodies etc. Much of this still litters Dili streets for lack of capacity to collect and dispose of it.\n15. Initial  solid  waste  management  activities  were  undertaken  through  the  Community\nEmpowerment  and  Local  Governance  Project  (CEP)  and  other  programs  mainly  in  Dili.\nWSSRP-1 provides support in critical areas such as markets and in the cleanup of large\nquantities of waste generated by the postconsultation destruction. Portugal has funded studies", "4\non  solid  waste  management  in  Dili  and  the  districts,  but  does  not  propose  to  fund  the\nimplementation of recommended proposals.\ne.  Drainage\n16. Except in Dili, the drainage systems in most towns comprise a network of minor street\ndrains and are not of major significance. In problem areas, the drains are smelly because of the\ndischarge of septic tank effluent and/or gray water, exacerbated by solid waste deposited in the\ndrains and lack of regular maintenance. Occasional flooding occurs during the wet season. Dili\nhas  a  major  drainage  system  constructed  originally  during  the  Portuguese  period  and\nsubsequently extended during the Indonesian period. The system has been poorly maintained\nand  badly  neglected  for  many  years.  Deficiencies  include  poorly  designed  and  poorly\nconstructed drains (frequently lacks level control), significant solid waste and silt deposition\nreducing drain cross-section, broken roadside entry pits, and broken or missing drain covers.\nThe drains provide breeding grounds for vermin and insects and are a significant health hazard.\nLack of maintenance combined with poor design and construction causes flooding during the\nwet season. A master plan for Dili drainage was prepared in 1995 but was not implemented.\n17. The drainage systems sustained no obvious damage during the violence, but they had\ngradually deteriorated even before the Indonesian withdrawal because of lack of maintenance\nand increasing use of the drains as receiving areas for solid waste including building rubble. No\nmajor systematic work has been undertaken on Dili drainage. Disposing solid waste including\ngeneral garbage and building waste into drains continues, reducing the capacity of the drains to\nhandle flood flows. Sediment deposition and agricultural activities in some major drains are also\nof concern.\n2.  Medium- to Long-Term Sector Development\n18. Since  the  postconsultation  violence,  investment  in  the  WS&S  sector  has  been\nsignificant.  Basic  services  have  been  restored  to  standards  similar  to  those  during  the\nIndonesian administration. Nevertheless substantial rehabilitation investment is still required and\ncapacity building is needed. Donor interest in the sector is high. WSSRP-1 has significantly\ncontributed to overall sector development.\n19. The development context may be summarized as follows:\n(i)  The emergency phase is over.\n(ii)  It is time for proper planning and implementation of proposed sector investments.\n(iii)  Substantial rehabilitation remains to be done.\n(iv)  Substantial medium-term sector investment is required to raise WS&S services\nto more appropriate levels.\n(v)  WSS  has  been  established,  but  it  is  a  new  institution  requiring  substantial\ncapacity building. Capacity building for other stakeholders is also essential.\n(vi)  Quality and sustainability are priorities for future sector investments.\n(vii)  An  integrated  approach  is  required  for  WS&S  implementation  to  deliver  the\nexpected benefits, particularly for the poor.", "5\nB.  Policies and Plans\n20. Appendix 3 gives an overview of the current policies and plans of WSS. These are\nbased on a draft strategic plan prepared in March 2000. The plan gives the overarching goal or\nmission statement for WSS:\n\"To  ensure  the  communities  of  East  Timor  have  access  to  such  water  and\nsanitation services as are considered essential for public health, protection of the\nenvironment and for promotion of economic growth.\u201d\n21. To  achieve  this  mission,  WSS  has  determined  the  following  four  key  areas  of\nresponsibility (in order of priority based on expected immediate health benefit):\n(i)  urban water supply;\n(ii)  community (i.e. rural) water supply and sanitation;\n(iii)  urban sanitation (i.e. drainage, wastewater, & solid Waste); and\n(iv)  water resources.\n22. Objectives determined for each of these areas are detailed in the draft strategic plan. To\nachieve the stated objectives, an organization/staffing structure and budget were proposed for\nFY2000/01. Unfortunately, the East Timor recurrent budget constraints necessitated a budget\nreduction of approximately 50 percent, and a staffing reduction of approximately 60 percent.\nThe  budget  constraints,  combined  with  numerous  international  staffing  shortcomings,  have\nallowed WSS to focus only on urban water supply and, to a lesser extent, community WS&S, to\nthis time.\n23. The status of the WSS staffing recruitment is indicated in Table 1.\nTable 1: WSS Staffing Levels\nLevela 1 2 3 4 5 6 Total\nApproved 2000-2001 Budget 47 58 30 13 4 1 153\nChanges arising from Oct Budget review 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nApproved staffing plan at this date 47 58 30 13 4 1 153\nRecruitment in process (CRO) 0 6 4 0 0 0 10\nRecruitment in process (WSS) 21 22 11 11 1 1 67\nRecruited 26 30 15 2 3 0 76\nBudgeted Total Numbers 47 58 30 13 4 1 153\n     CRO = Central Recruitment Office of the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET),\nWSS = Water and Sanitation Service.\n     a These are grading levels for local staff as determined by the UNTAET.\n24. The WSS organization chart is in Appendix 3.\n1.  Urban Water Supply\n25. WSS is currently managing the O&M of urban water supplies in Dili and in 12 district\ncapital main towns. Levels of service are sufficient to achieve basic health objectives, but water\nquality is, at best, marginal. The longer term objectives are continual improvement and the\nmanagement of water supplies in 62 townships (i.e., all district and sub-district main towns\npreviously supplied with water supply systems by the Indonesian Government).", "6\n26. The achievement and sustainability of this ultimate objective depend on an increased\nbudget  (primarily  sourced  from  water-user  charges)  and  local  staffing  allocations.  WSS  is\ncurrently in the planning and resourcing stages for implementing water-user charges.\n2.  Community (Rural) Water Supply and Sanitation\n27. Some 70 percent of the population of East Timor live outside urban areas. Community-\nmanaged and operated small water supply systems will allow this large population to access\npiped water at minimal cost to East Timor's recurrent budget. Community management usually\nresults in a lower cost to users of small systems, but is usually accompanied by a lower, but\nacceptable, level of service.\n28. WSS aims to facilitate the provision of adequate, safe, and sustainable water supplies to\nrural  communities.  The  establishment  of  community-managed  water  supplies  is  a  lengthy\nprocess, requiring extensive community consultation and participation to ensure sustainability.\nWSS  has  accessed  substantial  external  resources  to  achieve  this  objective.  Such  funding\nusually also includes small-scale sanitation improvements and environmental health education.\n3.  Urban Sanitation (Drainage, Wastewater, and Solid Waste)\n29. Solid waste collection to date has been undertaken by district administrations in an ad\nhoc manner and with variable success. More sustainable waste collection and safe disposal\narrangements  are  increasingly  needed.  WSS  has  initiated  discussions  with  Dili  district  to\nimplement such arrangements through the private sector and to encourage waste minimization.\n30. Recent  heavy  rains  have  highlighted  the  need  for  proactive  activities  in  drainage.\nAlthough flooding is a transitory inconvenience, it does decrease road pavement life and creates\nbreeding sites for disease vectors. Again, there is an increasing need to maintain existing drains\nand undertake drainage improvements.\n31. East  Timor's  recurrent  budget  allocations  will  be  required  to  implement  drainage\nmaintenance and waste collection and disposal, although some minor external funding has\nbeen accessed to undertake one-off activities. WSS recently recruited an international staff\nmember to focus solely on achievement of sustainable urban sanitation arrangements. WSS is\nconfident such arrangements will be implemented within the coming six months, providing\nbudget allocations are forthcoming.\n4.  Water Resources\n32. The  assessment,  responsible  allocation,  and  adequate  protection  of  East  Timor's\nsurface and underground freshwater supplies are vital to the sustainable provision of water\nsupply at the lowest possible cost. To date, budget and staffing restrictions have prevented\nWSS from undertaking any significant activities in this important area. External funds may\nbecome  available  in  the  future,  but  will  depend  on  East  Timor  identifying  water  resource\nmanagement as a priority funding area. Some initial technical assistance is provided in the\nproposed project to support WSS in water resource management.\n5.  Policy Development and Institutional Capacity Building\n33. WSSRP-1 is taking a lead role developing the water sector policy by preparing a legal\nand regulatory framework and legislation, developing tariff policies, and preparing standards", "7\nand  guidelines.  Considerable  capacity  building  is  required  and  is  being  provided  through\nWSSRP-1 and through the Capacity Building Project for East Timor (CAPET) project of the\nAustralian Agency for International Development (AusAID).\nC.  External Assistance to the Sector\n34. Since  the  destruction  of  September  1999,  external  assistance  has  contributed  to\nsignificant  progress  in  both  emergency  system  repairs  and  planning  for  more  substantial\nrehabilitation and augmentation. Appendix 4 lists the major external assistance activities of\nmultilateral agencies, bilateral sources, and NGOs. The major interventions follow.\n35. Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) has completed the Study on Urgent\nImprovement for Water Supply Systems in East Timor. The study covers 15 towns including Dili.\nAmong the towns are 12 district capitals (excluding Oecusse) plus the townships of Ermera\n(Ermera), Maubisse (Ainaro), and Vila/Beloi on Atauro Island. Indications are that JICA will fund\nsystems implementation in 2-5 towns to be selected from Liquica, Lospalos, Ainaro, Suai, and\nMaliana.\n36. Japan has committed some $11.28 million to the planning, design, and implementation\nof improvements to the urban water supply for Dili. Planning for this phase has been completed\nand implementation commenced in March 2001. This activity is funded by the Government of\nJapan with implementation being managed by the United Nations Office of Project Services\n(UNOPS). WSS and the Japanese Government are currently discussing a refocusing of some\naspects of the ongoing project. WSS proposed a closer look at the distribution system to fully\nrealize the benefits of the headworks currently planned by the Project. The proposed change in\nscope will increase access to safe drinking water supplies and reduce system leakage.\n37. Australia  has  provided  significant  funding  for  emergency  rehabilitation  activities\nundertaken through NGOs including Oxfam and Bia Hula. In addition it has given substantial\nassistance to WSS through the Staffing Assistance Program for East Timor (SAPET) and the\nCAPET. Further capacity building assistance totaling $1.5 million is planned during 2001-2003.\nAustralia also plans to provide $8 million for a community/rural WS&S program that will focus on\nthe districts of Kova Lima, Bobonaro, and Viqueque over three years starting September 2001.\n38. Portugal is funding a range of activities covering water, sanitation, and solid waste. IPE-\nAguas de Portugal (Aquapor) is undertaking a range of water supply system rehabilitation\nmeasures in Aileu and Baucau. The total commitment from Portugal to date is approximately\n$2.5 million (including some studies for solid waste and sewerage), of which $1 million is for\nactivities planned for implementing rehabilitation in 2001 primarily in Baucau.\n39. Germany is funding water supply system rehabilitation in the districts of Baucau and\nViqueque. The German Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ) is the primary funding and\nimplementing agency, with some additional funding from Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW).\nThis work is focused on the district capital of Viqueque and on seven subdistrict centers. The\nGTZ budget is $1.6 million over two years with a planned extension of two years. KfW is\nunderstood to be contributing $0.5 million (DM1.0 million) to this work.\n40. The Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) recently committed $2 million\nover  three  years  for  implementing  rural  WS&S  programs  in  Aileu,  Ainaro,  and  Lautem.\nImplementation will be undertaken by Care Canada beginning in the second quarter of 2001.", "8\n41. The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) is implementing a program for WS&S for\nschools, which will cover some 200 schools by June 2001. In implementing this work, UNICEF\nis  working  with  former  Indonesian  Government  Health  Department  Sanitarians  who  have\nestablished  a  local  NGO,  East  Timor  Sanitarians  Association  (ETSA),  for  WS&S  sector\nactivities. The UNICEF activities include WS&S and health promotion education for teachers.\nUNICEF is also promoting the local manufacture of components (pour flush toilets, well rings)\nfor rural WS&S systems through technical assistance and training for village entrepreneurs.\n42. International NGOs have undertaken extensive works in several districts in association\nwith local NGOs or community-based organizations. The most significant participants include\nOxfam, Action Contre la Faim (ACF), Care, and the International Committee of the Red Cross\n(ICRC). In coordination with UNICEF, the European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO)\nplans to fund WS&S for schools to be implemented by some international NGOs.\n43. The  CEP  is  providing  funds  for  local  development  projects  at  the  village  level.\nApproximately 50 percent of the project funding is allocated to social infrastructure (including\nwater supply). Based on a small sample of second round proposals received to date, water\ncould account for some 10-20 percent of total CEP funding.\n44. WSS  undertakes  sector  coordination  through  regular  WSS  coordination  meetings\ninvolving  all  relevant  donors,  implementing  agencies,  and  UNTAET  departments.  The\narrangements are working well.\n45. WSSRP-1's project management unit (PMU) has played a significant role in supporting\nWSS with sector coordination activities. It has facilitated the identification and elimination of\npotential overlaps. WSSRP-1 has also been able to identify critical program gaps and to provide\nappropriate support to close these gaps in many instances.\nD.  Poverty Situation\n1.  General Assessment\n46. East Timor's massive political, economic, and social upheaval in the period from August\n1999 to September 1999 exacerbated the previously high poverty levels. By mid-2000, security\nwas being restored. Farming is the primary occupation of 85 percent of household heads. Cash\nincomes are almost nonexistent among the rural population. The poor are characterized by lack\nof education and low literacy, high dependency burdens, and a dependence on agriculture.\n47. Using  survey  data  (in  the  ADB-funded  report, East  Timor  Rapid  Assessment  of\nEconomic and Social Conditions, 2000) as the basis for estimating poverty from 1999 to mid-\n2000, the head count index has climbed significantly, reaching around 75 percent. Prior to this,\nthe incidence of poverty based on the official Indonesian poverty line fell from around 37 percent\nin 1993 to around 25 percent in 1997, but from 1997 to 1999 it climbed back to 37 percent due\nto the financial crisis and political upheaval. Prior to 1998, the average income of the poor\n(those below the poverty line) was around 2 percent less than the poverty line. From 1998, this\nhas steadily increased to about 7 percent in the first half of 2000.\n2.  Pro-Poor Growth/Interventions\n48. Several agencies carried out much planning and implementation of interventions during\nthe  transition  from  the  previous  Indonesian  administration  to  self-government  by  the  East", "9\nTimorese.  ADB  is  implementing  three  pro-poor  projects:  (i)  emergency  infrastructure\nrehabilitation: repairing bridges, power supplies, airports, ports etc.; (ii) rehabilitation of power\nand sanitation services; and (iii) microfinance delivery. In addition, ADB has several technical\nassistance (TA) studies: (i) poverty assessment and statistics; (ii) community empowerment; (iii)\ntransport  sector  rehabilitation;  (iv)  capacity  building  for  governance  and  public  sector\nmanagement; (v) rehabilitation of telecommunications; (vi) TAs in two aspects of microfinance:\n(a) small scale, and (b) policy and regulatory; (vii) environmental assessment capacity; (viii)\ncapacity building for local governments; and (ix) an economic policy forum.\n3.  Governance\n49. Many governance challenges face the new nation of East Timor. Democratic processes\nare  being  introduced.  Self-government  is  a  relatively  new  and  emerging  concept.  The\nchallenges will be to rebuild trust as a first step to participating in government, especially at the\nlocal level, and to ensure as much local participation in government administration as possible.\nA very important requirement of good governance is the skills base to provide the basic services\nof  government.  Basic  education,  preventive  health  Care,  family  planning,  and  improved\nagricultural production are the priority areas for investment and capacity building. Important\ninfrastructure is also needed to facilitate the delivery of education and health services, and to\nstimulate commercial activity, especially in the agriculture sector. The reconstruction of schools\nand health clinics and their staffing needs are also priorities. The speedy reconstruction of land\ntransport infrastructure is critical to pro-poor economic development.\n4.  Social Development\n50. Education indicators are generally poor. The last officially recorded literacy rates in 1986\nwere 51 percent on a national basis and 64 percent among adults. Evidence suggests a distinct\ngender bias in education enrollment. For example, in 1998, 52 percent of females over 10 years\nof age had never been to school. Postprimary education is still disrupted, and literacy among\nthe rural poor is less than 50 percent.\n51. The upheaval in 1999 had a serious impact on health services. Most facilities were\ndamaged, and 130 of 160 physicians were reported to have departed by mid-2000. Existing\nservices in rural communities are extremely limited. However, emergency services are provided\nby NGOs and donors. Prior to 1999, life expectancy was around 55-58 years. Infant mortality\nwas moderately high at 85 deaths per 1,000 births, and only 37 percent of all births were\nattended by medical staff. The under-five mortality rate was moderately high at 124 deaths per\n1,000 births, and immunization rates varied from 60 to 90 percent. Only 25 percent of villages\nhad a health clinic, and the average distance to a hospital was 75 kilometers.\nE.  The Water Supply and Sanitation Rehabilitation Project - Phase I\n1.  Overview\n52. After the 1999 upheaval, East Timor needed assistance in rehabilitating the WS&S\nsector.  The  required  funding  was  estimated  at  $39.9  million  for  the  FYs  2000-2003,  with\napproximately $12 million-15 million expected from TFET funds and the remaining balance from\nother sources. Under WSSRP-1, $4.5 million was allocated for FY2000/01.\n53. WSSRP-1  comprised  three  components:  water  sector  management  and  investment\nprogram, capacity building and institutional development, and WS&S implementation program.", "10\nThe  activities  were  developed  in  consultation  with  other  donors  to  ensure  that  they  are\nappropriate in the overall external assistance framework for the sector. The scope allowed\nflexible  implementation  to  meet  the  changing  needs  of  WSS  and  to  ensure  coordination\nbetween the various donors in the sector.\n54. WSSRP-1  covered  only  initial  rehabilitation  of  the  WS&S  sector.  It  began  on  1\nSeptember 2000 and is expected to be completed on 30 June 2001, in anticipation of a follow-\nup TFET-funded WS&S rehabilitation project, subject to the availability of funds for the purpose.\n55. UNTAET was the recipient of the TFET grant. UNTAET established a PMU within WSS\nthat reports to the UNTAET Infrastructure Cabinet Member through the head of WSS. The PMU\nwas responsible for programming, administration, and coordination of daily project activities and\nplayed the role of an executing agency. UNTAET also established a project steering committee\nfor broad stakeholder representation.\n2.  Status of Implementation\n56. Implementation began on 1 September 2000 and progressed within the schedule and\nbudget. Physical progress is about 90 percent and completion is expected between June and\nSeptember 2001. As of 19 May 2001, disbursements from the TFET amounted to $3.2 million;\ncash expenditures, $1.9 million; and contract commitments, $1.8 million.\n57. Progress on the three WSSRP-1 components is as follows.\n58. WS&S Sector Management and Investment Program. The PMU was established and a\ndetailed, budgeted program implementation document for the coordinated improvement of East\nTimor\u2019s WS&S sector, including a sector management and investment framework (SMIF) was\nprepared.\n59. Capacity Building and Institutional Development Program. In coordination with WSS\nand relevant bilateral sources, WSSRP-1 identified priority capacity and institutional development\nactivities. Assistance was being given to prepare a policy, legislative and regulatory framework\nand to prepare WS&S standards and guidelines for national application. Key staff are receiving\ncustomer focus training. This component also provides timely assistance to evolving and longer\nterm needs, including support for the quick-response facility in component 3.\n60. Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Implementation  Program.  This  component  provided\nphysical rehabilitation and development assistance to beneficiaries:\n(i)  The  WS&S  quick-response  facility  has  been  utilized  to  support  WSS  in\nundertaking  urgent,  substantial  repairs  to  and  rehabilitation  of  water  supply\nsystems across all 13 districts of East Timor.\n(ii)  The  Dili  water  supply  repair  and  rehabilitation  program  has  provided\nsupplementary  and  complementary  rehabilitation  work  such  as  small  local\ncontracts, construction contracts for deepwell drilling, as well as urban and peri-\nurban low-income works such as repairs and rehabilitation of public taps and\nother water points. The aim was to maximize the benefit of major works being\nimplemented by other sources, particularly the Japanese Government.", "11\n(iii)  The district water supply repair and rehabilitation program has provided a range\nof assistance to address the needs of smaller urban and rural communities\nthroughout the 13 districts of East Timor. Community participation and planning\nprocesses are being used during implementation to ensure sustainability and\nequity. A major portion of the assistance has been delivered through local and\ninternational NGOs working with local community-based organizations.\n61. Except for the sanitation, drainage, and solid waste disposal activities which are still\nbeing developed, most of the outputs for all the components have been achieved within the set\ntime frame and budget.\n3.  Beneficiaries\n62. WSSRP-1 is designed to distribute its benefits in an equitable manner across East\nTimorese  urban  and  rural  communities,  thus  contributing  to  sustainable  development  and\noperation in the WS&S sector and to poverty reduction.\n63. The immediate benefits include (i) providing the means for improved water supply and\nsanitation,  and  (ii)  upgrading  the  quality  of  life  for  people  in  both  urban  and  rural  areas.\nWSSRP-1 is generating employment for local labor, thus helping to create a stable social and\neconomic environment. WSSRP-1 directly or indirectly benefits a large part of the country's\n800,000 population.\n4.  Lessons Learned\n64. WSSRP-1 was designed to allow flexibility during implementation. This design aspect\nhas worked well, allowing the PMU to work with WSS to address emerging priority needs\nthrough appropriate modifications in the project framework. Other areas where this flexibility\nwas evident include (i) support to physical activities in the Japanese Government program for\nDili water supply through the community activities provided under the Bia Hula NGO contract;\nand (ii) the use of NGOs as contractors in the districts in which they have previous experience\nand are therefore readily able to assess priorities and undertake a wide range of physical\nrehabilitation, community participatory implementation, and hygiene promotion programs.\n65. WSSRP-1  has  been  extremely  beneficial  in  supporting  WSS  with  overall  sector\ncoordination  through  regular  meetings  with  other  sources  and  implementing  organizations.\nThus, potential overlaps in aid programs were identified and avoided. WSSRP-1 also allowed\nthe PMU to identify and address priorities not being addressed by other aid programs.\n66. The involvement of NGOs has been crucial to the success of WSSRP-1 because WSS\nlacked  resources,  particularly  in  the  districts,  and  the  rehabilitation  activities  are  not  for\nconventional implementation through contractors. Simplified contracts based on the scope of\nworks and priorities contained in the NGO proposals were successfully implemented within the\nconstrained implementation time frame. The use of NGOs has enabled community participatory\napproaches to be integrated with physical rehabilitation implementation activities and capacity\nbuilding for WSS district staff.", "12\nIV.  THE PROJECT\nA.  Rationale\n67. UNTAET is executing a program of humanitarian assistance in East Timor, part of which\ninvolves  rehabilitation  of  WS&S  facilities  damaged  during  the  September  1999  crisis.  The\nchallenge, however, is not just restoring the facilities to their precrisis status, but making sure\nsustainability  and  cost  recovery  can  be  achieved  in  the  postcrisis  environment.  WSSRP-1\nprovided substantial assistance to strengthen the institutional capacity of WSS by establishing\nessential institutional infrastructure including buildings, vehicles, tools and equipment for O&M;\ndeveloping policies including a regulatory and legislative framework, tariff policy, standards and\nguidelines;  and  supporting  key  operational  areas  including  development  of  information-\neducation-communication  (IEC)  capability  and  program  development.  WSSRP-1  also\nrehabilitated priority public and community water supply works in Dili and the districts, and PMU\nadvisers  assisted  WSS  with  overall  sector  and  aid  coordination.  WSS  has  progressed\nsignificantly since its establishment and currently has operational units in each district capital.\n68. The  remaining  challenges  are  significant.  The  capacity  of  WSS  to  plan,  develop,\noperate, and maintain WS&S systems requires strengthening through further support for policy\nand  systems  development  and  training.  While  emergency  assistance  and  support  under\nWSSRP-1 has allowed the repair and rehabilitation of existing water supply systems in Dili and\nthe  district  capital  towns,  WS&S  coverage  remains  below  developing  country  targets  and\nservice coverage improvement will require additional sector investment over the coming years.\nB.  Objectives\n69. The Project will (i) extend the operation of the PMU established under WSSRP-1 to\nimplement the Project and to plan for future development of the WS&S sector; (ii) implement a\ncapacity building and institutional development program to provide training in priority areas,\nassist in key policy development initiatives, and strengthen the capacity of WSS to coordinate\nthe overall development assistance for the sector; (iii) undertake priority WS&S implementation\nthat will include (a) a WS&S quick response facility; (b) Dili water supply rehabilitation and\nimprovement; (c) district water supply rehabilitation and improvements; (d) community WS&S\nrehabilitation and improvement; and (e) extension of limited initial works to improve deteriorating\nurban sanitation infrastructure and services particularly in Dili, focusing on drainage and solid\nand human waste management. The works under (ii) and (iii) will complement activities that are\nplanned by other sources or are already under way.\nC.  Scope\n1.  Project Management Unit (Component 1)\n70. PMU advisers, support staff, and operational expenses will be funded. The long-term\nadvisers  will  include  an  East  Timorese  project  manager  and  two  international  advisers:  a\ncommunity development adviser and a chief technical adviser. One of the two international\nadvisers will be appointed as PMU team leader. This team will be supported by an East\nTimorese  community  development  specialist  and  a  number  of  local  support  staff.  A  chief\nfinancial adviser may be appointed.", "13\n2.  Capacity Building and Institutional Development (Component 2)\na.  Capacity Building Technical Assistance (Subcomponent 2.1)\n71. TA to WSS will cover a range of activities such as policy development, human resources\ndevelopment, and institutional support including (i) training programs for WSS staff in identified\npriority areas; (ii) assistance in developing management and financial information systems; (iii) a\nwater resources study to aid in developing water resource management plans and institutional\narrangements; (iv) support for implementing a tariff system initially in Dili and selected district\ncapital  towns  focusing  initially  on  major  water  uses;  (v)  support  for  developing  asset\nmanagement systems focusing initially on urban water supply systems; (vi) support to the head\nof WSS in major projects and aid coordination; and (vii) environmental monitoring, evaluation,\nand capacity building.\nb.  Information Technology and Communications Equipment\n(Subcomponent 2.2)\n72. Essential computer and communication systems will be upgraded, including establishing\na local area network for the central/Dili office of WSS including the PMU, and improving internet\nand e-mail facilities. This is a prerequisite to the development of management and financial\ninformation systems and efficient day-to-day operation of WSS and the PMU.\n3.  Water Supply & Sanitation Implementation (Component 3)\na.  WS&S Quick Response Facility (Subcomponent 3.1)\n73. Funding will be provided for quick-response activities to support repair and rehabilitation\nneeds that arise during the project period. The activities will cover design, procurement, and\nconstruction  activities.  Examples  are  restoration  of  transmission  or  distribution  pipelines\ndamaged during wet season flooding or through other natural disasters, which are common in\nEast Timor.\nb.  Dili Water Supply Rehabilitation and Improvement (Subcomponent\n3.2)\n74. Equipment will be procured and contracts implemented for priority Dili water supply\nsystem rehabilitation and improvement. Priority activities will be selected in conjunction with\nWSS and will focus on essential rehabilitation and reinforcement to complement the work being\nundertaken under the Japanese Government-funded Dili Water Supply Project, which focuses\non headworks augmentation. An NGO will be engaged to support WSS activities including\nimplementation of IEC programs, community mapping, and problem solving/conflict resolution\nassociated with WSS programs. The NGO activities will not only support TFET-funded activities\nbut also programs of other donors, particularly the Government of Japan. Gauging stations will\nbe installed on surface water sources for Dili to improve the data available for reliable yield\nestimates and future water resource planning. The meteorology station in Dili will be restored. A\nbudget allocation will be made for minor design, documentation, supervision and civil works to\nsupport priority activities.", "14\nc.  District Town (Public) Water Supply Rehabilitation and Improvement\n(Subcomponent 3.3)\n75. Equipment will be procured and construction contracts implemented to rehabilitate and\nimprove  priority  district  capital  water  supply  systems.  Priority  activities  will  be  selected  in\nconjunction with WSS and will be coordinated with the recommendations of the JICA master\nplans and the proposed JICA implementation activities in the towns. NGOs will be contracted to\nassist in essential rehabilitation activities in the selected districts with a range of related IEC and\nhygiene promotion programs. Gauging stations will be installed on surface water sources for\nsome of the district capital towns to improve the data available for reliable yield estimates and\nfuture  water  resource  planning.  A  budget  allocation  will  be  made  for  minor  design,\ndocumentation, supervision, and civil works to support priority activities.\nd.  Community Water Supply and Sanitation Rehabilitation and\nImprovement (Subcomponent 3.4)\n76. Rehabilitation  and  improvement  of  community-based  WS&S  systems  will  receive\nassistance. Because of the limited capability within WSS, particularly in the districts, appropriate\nmechanisms must be selected to ensure that the proposed investments can be implemented\nand coordinated effectively. Two approaches are proposed: (i) supporting other donor programs\nby extending their scope or geographic coverage, and (ii) engaging NGOs on contracts to\nundertake  further  implementation  activities  in  priority  areas  within  districts  where  they  are\ncurrently active.\ne.  Urban Sanitation Improvement (Subcomponent 3.5)\n77. Assistance will support key urban sanitation initiatives, particularly in Dili. Assistance will\ninclude investments in solid waste collection, septic tank desludging, and septage treatment.\nProposals  will  be  developed  to  encourage  the  involvement  of  private  sector  resources  in\nproviding these services. Drainage systems will be rehabilitated by force account with focus on\ncleaning drains, structural repair, and mapping assets of priority drainage catchments.\nD.  Cost Estimates\n78. The total cost of the Project is estimated at $4.5 million equivalent and includes all costs\nfrom August 2001 to October 2002. TFET confirmed that the amount would be available in\nFY2001-02 for the Project. The cost estimates are summarized in Table 2 and outlined in more\ndetail in Appendix 5. The physical (14.6 percent) and price (2.4 percent) contingencies are the\nsame  as  for  WSSRP-1  and  higher  than  contingencies  under  ADB's  standard  procedures.\nHowever,  they  are  considered  justifiable  for  the  following  reasons:  (i)  introduction  of  new\nlegislation, (ii) introduction of taxation, (iii) absence of insurance cover, (iv) lack of competitive\nenvironment, and (v) private sector premiums.", "15\nTable 2: Summary of Project Costs\n(US$ million)\nComponents Total Cost\nA.

Financing Plan\n79. The total cost of the Project will be out of the TFET. Contributions to the TFET do not\ninclude ADB resources.6\n80. The Project covers FY2002 commencing in August 2001. The implementation activities\nare expected to continue through to October 2002.\nF.  Implementation Arrangements\n1.  Executing Agency\n81. UNTAET will be the recipient of the grant from the TFET. It will establish a PMU within\nWSS that will report to the UNTAET Infrastructure Cabinet Member via the head of WSS. The\nPMU will program, administer, and coordinate daily project activities in cooperation with WSS,\nmultilateral and bilateral donors, NGOs, community groups, and other stakeholders. Works and\nactivities funded out of the TFET will be fully integrated with aid-funded activities and projects.\nThe PMU will be headed by an East Timorese project manager (WS&S engineer) and include\nan East Timorese community development specialist. Their selection will be subject to ADB\napproval.  Two  internationally  recruited  consultants\u2013a  chief  technical  adviser  (CTA)  and  a\ncommunity development adviser (CDA), one of whom will be the PMU team leader \u2013will support\n                  \n6  An amount of $4.5 million has been earmarked in the TFET budget for FY2002 for the WS&S sector.", "16\nthe project manager in administering the Project and its contracts in accordance with ADB\nguidelines. Total international consulting services will be 52 person-months: 32 for the PMU and\n20 for the capacity building. The CTA and CDA, in coordination with WSA staff, will program and\ncoordinate daily project activities, including design, supervision, procurement of goods and\nservices, and management of civil works contracts. The international consultants will train their\nEast Timorese counterparts in the consultants' areas of responsibility. The organization chart of\nthe PMU and the terms of reference for the core PMU advisers are in Appendix 6. Under the\norganizational framework of UNTAET, the PMU will be an integral part of WSS and will be\nabsorbed by the service.\n2.  Technical Approach\n82. Where  possible,  the  works  under  the  Project  will  incorporate  labor-intensive,\nemployment-generating methodologies. Technical solutions will adopt least-cost methodologies.\nThese include maximum use of local labor, materials, and contractors, and simple technologies\ncontributing to sustainability of these works.\n3.  Steering Committee\n83. UNTAET will establish a project steering committee (PSC) involving broader stakeholder\nrepresentation  in  project  implementation.  The  PSC  will  be  convened  prior  to  project\nimplementation to inform the stakeholders of project activities. It will then meet monthly to\ndiscuss and resolve emerging implementation, procurement, and community issues, and to\nreview and comment on the project reports for submission to ADB.\n4.  Procurement of Goods and Services\n84. All procurement under the Project will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. The\nproceeds of the Project will finance imports of goods and services, local purchases, and civil\nworks identified under the Project. Under ADB guidelines, procurement may be off the shelf, or\nthrough local competitive bidding or international competitive bidding, as appropriate. Contracts\nvalued in excess of $500,000 for goods and $1,000,000 for civil works are subject to the\nrequirements for international competitive bidding. International shopping may be permitted for\nsupply contracts not exceeding $500,000 and civil works not exceeding $1,000,000. Direct\npurchase of off-the-shelf items will be allowed for values less than $100,000. An indicative list of\nrepair and rehabilitation works and consulting services is attached as Appendix 7. The PMU and\nWSS will coordinate with the aid community to ensure, as far as possible, that materials and\nequipment are compatible and of appropriate technology and quality, that spare parts are\nreadily available at a fair price, and that common standards and levels of service are used in all\nWS&S projects in East Timor. Consulting ser` ices will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. Advance action for recruitment of consultants will not be\nrequired.", "17\n85. For purposes of this Project, the term \"member countries\" will include ADB member\ncountries, East Timor, and all external sources and members of international organizations that\nhave contributed funds to the TFET.7\n5.  Implementation Schedule\n86. The Project will be implemented over approximately 15 months, starting in August 2000\nand ending in October 2002. Every quarter, the PMU will prepare a detailed implementation\nschedule  of  project  activities.  Project  implementation  consultants  and  contractors  will  be\nselected in accordance with activity priorities in the implementation schedule, upon project\napproval,  and  when  the  Grant  Agreement  is  signed.  The  WSSRP-1  PMU  will  undertake\nsignificant advance preparation for a detailed activity plan for the Project and to ensure that\nconsultants are recruited in a timely manner. The initial project implementation schedule is in\nAppendix 8.\n6.  Rights-of-Way\n87. UNTAET stated that most of the works under the Project are within existing rights-of-\nway. If needed, UNTAET will obtain rights to any land required on a timely basis and in\naccordance with ADB's resettlement policy,8 and provide compensation (including for crops), as\nrequired, in accordance with ADB\u2019s relevant guidelines. Detailed designs will minimize land\nacquisition. The Project is not expected to require any resettlement.\n7.  Disbursement\n88. As the International Development Association (IDA) agreed, disbursements for eligible\nexpenditures will follow ADB\u2019s disbursement guidelines set out in ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement\nHandbook and may be made as direct payment or reimbursement, or through an imprest\naccount. The imprest account will be replenished in accordance with the handbook. The PMU\nteam  leader  will  be  responsible  for  transactions,  replenishments,  and  use  of  the  imprest\naccount. Payments under these agreements will be made by IDA, based on ADB\u2019s request.\n89. Under the direct purchase procedure, the PMU will ask ADB to make a direct payment to\nthe supplier of goods and services. ADB will approve the request and send it to IDA, which will\npay the supplier directly. Request for payment will use ADB\u2019s standard withdrawal application.\nThe PMU will indicate in the withdrawal application the date on which payment becomes due to\nthe supplier. A separate application will be filled out for each currency in which the payment is\nrequested. The application will be submitted with supporting documents such as contracts,\ninvoices, receipts, and vouchers. This procedure will be used for payment of (i) consultants'\nfees,  and  (ii)  equipment  and  civil  works  contracts  awarded  on  the  basis  of  international\ncompetitive bidding. Copies of signed contracts will be forwarded to ADB as early as possible to\nfacilitate timely payments.\n90. The reimbursement procedure will be used when eligible expenditures are paid from\nUNTAET\u2019s budget and reimbursement claimed through ADB from the TFET. The PMU will\n                  \n7  R74-00: Joint Management Arrangements for the Trust Fund for East Timor, 23 March 2000.

The\nreimbursement procedure will be used for payment of (i) small purchases and (ii) short-term civil\nworks contracts.\n91. Under the imprest account fund procedure, ADB will ask IDA to advance funds to the\nPMU to meet subproject expenditures to prefinance payments to contractors and suppliers. The\nimprest account will be used for short-term civil works, small-scale design and supervision\nservices, remuneration of East Timorese staff, and small purchases under all cost categories\neligible for financing. ADB\u2019s statement-of-expenditure procedure will be used for reimbursement\nof expenditures and for liquidation of the imprest account for payments with value equal to or\nbelow $1,000 each. The currency of the imprest account will be the US dollar and the maximum\ninitial advance will be $1,000,000. The team leader supported by the PMU will be responsible\nfor administrative and accounting tasks under the Project and will establish adequate internal\ncontrol, accounting, and audit procedures to ensure efficient use of the imprest account and its\noperation. The imprest account will be established in Dili, subject to ADB's approval.\n8.  Reports, Accounts, and Audits\n92. UNTAET, with the support of the PMU, will furnish ADB with quarterly progress reports\nconcerning all aspects, including finances, procurement of services, equipment, and all civil\nworks in the Project, including bilateral activities. The PMU will prepare quarterly expenditure\nbudgets a month before the start of the following quarter. UNTAET, with the support of the\nPMU,  will  also  provide  quarterly  reports  on  the  use  of  the  recurrent  UNTAET  water  and\nsanitation budget, including activities and expenditures; and report progress in implementing\npolicy initiatives, WS&S regulations, and organizational changes. The PMU will also prepare a\nfinal project completion report on all aspects of the Project in accordance with ADB\u2019s relevant\nguidelines, one month before physical completion.\n93. The PMU will establish the necessary accounts in Dili, if possible. This bank account will\nbe under the control of the PMU team leader. The PMU will establish and maintain separate\naccounts for all eligible expenditures under the Project, including its individual contracts and\nother project components, and will furnish ADB with accounts and related financial statements\nfollowing international or other appropriate accounting standards. Auditors acceptable to ADB\nwill then audit the financial statements. The audited financial statements, together with the\nauditor\u2019s report, will be forwarded to ADB within six months of the end of the fiscal year. The\nPMU consultants will keep detailed records on the costing and expenditures of the project\ncomponents and will assist with reporting.\n9.  Technical Midterm Review\n94. In addition to a schedule of regular reviews to monitor project progress, a technical\nreview of the Project will be carried out within six months after mobilization to determine any\nneed to adjust the project design or implementation. The review will also assess the adequacy\nof funds, cost overruns, need for reallocations, and other factors, if any, including assumptions\nand risks that may constrain the satisfactory implementation of the Project and achievement of\ndevelopment objectives.", "19\n10.  Benefit Monitoring and Implementation\n95. The PMU will supervise and monitor the various contractors during implementation. All\nsector activities are expected to be implemented through the PMU, which will in turn coordinate\nits activities with the other sector programs through WSS. A comprehensive benefit monitoring\nand evaluation (BME) program will be developed during the implementation of component 1 and\nin conjunction with data generated through other ADB and other donor projects. A set of\npredetermined criteria and indicators will be identified, based on the key information needs of\nthe WSS in UNTAET and ADB. The BME will be used, along with the conventional project\nperformance monitoring systems approach, to assess the progress and implementation of the\nuse of funds and delivery of public works and infrastructure activities, and measure the impacts\nresulting from project implementation strategies. BME is important to identify and address the\npriority needs of the intended beneficiaries, and ensure that indicators more accurately reflect\nlocal  experiences.  Key  areas  for  BME  will  include  (i)  technical  and  physical  aspects,  (ii)\nsocioeconomic development, and (iii) human and institutional development. Impacts will be\nmeasured in terms of increased community participation, public accountability, transparency,\nbetter provision and coverage of basic services (especially for women and the poor), and\nopportunities and direct employment generation.\nV.  PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA.  General\n96. The  Project  will  have  a  positive  social  impact  on  the  East  Timorese  population,\nparticularly the poor. It will provide safe water and sanitation to a large part of the population.\nReady access to safe WS&S services will have significant long-term benefits by reducing\nwaterborne  diseases  including  diarrhea,  dysentery,  malaria,  and  skin  diseases.  It  will  also\ncontribute to human capital development and reduce poverty by putting labor, i.e., fetching\nwater, to more productive uses. The Project will maximize the use of local contractors in its\nrepair and rehabilitation works, thereby creating jobs at the local level. It will help to develop\nsector policies and institutional frameworks in which WS&S services are delivered so that they\ntake account of the needs of the poor.\n97. Following the complete destruction of all water-related infrastructure, it can be assumed\nthat  the  net  economic  benefits  will  be  positive,  especially  in  the  urban  areas  where  tariff\nschemes will eventually be introduced. In the rural areas, freeing labor for more productive\neconomic uses and reducing health-related costs are expected to result in the project's being\nnet economically positive.\n98. A key lesson is that in all aspects of WS&S project design, construction, operation, and\nmaintenance, the focus must be on striving for sustainable solutions. Experience in many\ncountries over many years has shown that the traditional least-cost approach to planning water\nsupply projects is inadequate to achieve sustainable resource use efficiency. What is required is\nan approach that integrates both supply- and demand-side concerns, and accounts for non-\nmarket costs and benefits. The extent to which benefits from water supply are likely to be\nsustained will depend on greater recognition of the role that prices can play in managing water\ndemand,  expanding  supply,  and  conserving  the  environment.  WSSRP-1  is  addressing  the\nestablishment of, and improvement in, tariff levels and structures and further support will be\nprovided  for  implementation  under  the  proposed  Project.  The  improvement  will  ensure", "20\ndifferential tariff regimes for different customer segments, some degree of cost recovery, and\nsustainability of services.\nB.  Environmental Aspects\n99. The Project is in environmental category B. An initial environmental examination (IEE)\nwas conducted in accordance with ADB's Environmental Assessment Requirements (Appendix\n9).\n100. The  Project  will  involve  only  minor  construction;  as  such,  transient  environmental\ndisturbances  normally  experienced  during  construction  will  be  insignificant.  Typical\nenvironmental disturbances related to water supply and sanitation will include minor excavations\nto replace or install pipes and fittings and repair drains; temporary road and street closures to\nallow pipe and drain construction activity; minor clearing along short lengths of existing pipeline\nroutes to allow repairs and rehabilitation; clearing of small areas (up to 20 square meters) to\ngive construction equipment and vehicles access to sites such as boreholes or other facilities;\nand minor, short-term, associated soil erosion if works are undertaken in high rainfall periods.\n101. Most of these disturbances will be on existing sites and only temporary. It is possible that\nnew sites will be required particularly for new bores, storage and associated facilities. Sites will\nbe  selected  after  community  consultation  and,  wherever  possible,  will  be  on  public  or\ngovernment-owned land. They will have an areal impact generally limited to less than 100\nsquare meters. As most works will involve the repair or replacement of existing pipelines and\nother water supply and sanitation facilities, environmental effects will be insignificant. Other\nworks  of  significance  include  the  proposed  repair  and  rehabilitation  and/or  construction  of\nWS&S related structures such as intakes, pump stations, treatment plants, generator rooms,\nstorage tanks, and boreholes. These works will generally be carried out on sites of existing\n(damaged) structures and no significant environmental effects are foreseen other than normal\nsmall building construction activities such as cartage of building materials and construction\nnoise. Again any effects will be small and temporary, possibly lasting from a few days to a few\nweeks. Specific measures will be incorporated in contracts for works at or adjacent to water\nintakes to prevent contamination of water supplies.\n102. A potential significant adverse operational impact is the increased local discharge of\nwastewater because of improved water supplies. In many instances, wastewater discharges will\nbe reduced because uncontrolled connections will be reduced and major pipe leaks repaired.\nAny  adverse  impact  will  be  mitigated  by  repairing  and  rehabilitating  drainage  systems  in\nproblem areas. Any other potential or identified adverse effects will be preempted or minimized\nby (i) improving water resource management, and (ii) promoting environmental conservation\nthrough community participation and education activities. The capacity of existing final disposal\nsites will be considered for studies related to additional waste disposal sites.\n103. Some project activities will significantly enhance the environment. The drainage, solid\nwaste management, and septage collection and treatment will substantially improve the urban\nenvironment, particularly in Dili, through reduced flooding, improved water quality, and reduced\nhealth risks.\n104. The  Project  will  also  contribute  environmentally  sustainable  development  through\nenvironmental monitoring under the guidance of the PMU. Monitoring will include (i) measuring\nthe effectiveness of any environmental improvements needed, (ii) identifying problems that may\narise during the works, and (iii) if necessary, providing ecological audit information for future", "21\nworks of this nature. The proposed monitoring will be designed to quantify the benefits gained\nand  any  impacts  sustained  from  repairing  and  rehabilitating  town  and  community  WS&S\nsystems. The PMU will define environmental parameters to be monitored, and will include the\nquality of raw water, treated water, and delivered water; the need for and effectiveness of\ndrainage systems; environmental conditions in river and spring catchments, including pollution\nand land clearing, landslide, and erosion problems affecting WS&S facilities; efficiency and\neffectiveness of sanitation facilities; and growth of algae in reservoirs. WSS will be responsible\nfor  all  water  quality  testing  (chemical  and  bacteriological)  and,  in  cooperation  with  local\ncommunities, also for monitoring construction and postconstruction environmental aspects.\n105. An  environmental  specialist  under  the  Project  will  assist  the  PMU  in  ensuring  that\nappropriate environmental mitigation measures are included in implementing project activities\nand that the PMU implements appropriate monitoring and reporting.\n106. Thus, while there will be some minor and transient environmental impacts, the medium-\nand long-term impacts of the Project are positive, especially in promoting economic and social\ndevelopment in East Timor and facilitating the nation's reconstruction and development. A\ndetailed environmental impact assessment is not required. However, if any new additional\nfacilities need to be developed, environmental assessment will be carried out.\n107. Under UNTAET, Indonesian environmental laws remain valid, although implementation\ncapacity  will  need  to  be  developed.  UNTAET  is  presently  reviewing  environmental  laws,\nregulations, and standards, and these may be applied to the Project in the future, although the\nProject is not expected to result in any adverse outcomes. Conversely, the PMU and WSS will\ncompile project environmental reports, information from which will be passed on to the relevant\nsection of UNTAET for consideration when developing environmental standards and legislation.\nC.  Social Issues and Poverty\n108. The Project will rehabilitate impaired water supply and sanitation services. An initial\nsocial assessment was prepared (Appendix 10).\n109. The Project is expected to have a significant positive social impact. By providing the\nmeans for improved water supply and sanitation, the Project will upgrade enhance the quality of\nlife of people in both urban and rural areas who will no longer need to spend much time, energy,\nand financial resources to obtain their daily water needs. In addition, the Project will generate\nemployment for local labor, thus helping to create a stable social and economic environment.\n110. Under the Project, a series of participatory exercises at community, local, district, and\nregional levels with citizens, government, and civil society (and the private sector as relevant)\nwill be led by a participation specialist working with a small team. The exercises will permit\nassessment of progress and challenges in the ongoing WSSRP-1 and promote improvements in\nthe Project. Voices of poor and vulnerable citizens will be heard in planning subsequent steps,\nand the work of government and civil society in responding to these voices will be reviewed.\nCitizens, NGOs, and new government organizations will take part in (i) planning sustainable\nwater and sanitation systems including local maintenance and management wherever feasible,\nand (ii) identifying and prioritizing needs for upgrading the skills of NGO and government staff to\nmaximize institutional capacity enhancement and sustainability. Plans for self-monitoring and\nongoing sharing among groups will be made in conjunction with follow-up training and support\nat every level throughout the Project.", "22\n111. The Project will involve no relocation or resettlement. Land acquisition will be minimal,\nwith the majority of facilities being constructed on public land or rights-of-way. Procedures\nestablished during WSSRP-1 will be used for negotiating land use and access rights, and\nappropriate compensation for private land where public land is not available. The beneficiary\nconsultations during WSSRP-1 confirmed widespread support for the proposed activities, which\nwill be continued in the Project. The project construction activities will generate significant\nemployment opportunities, and delivered services will free the labor force for more productive\nuses.\n112. Even before the 1999 destruction and displacement, East Timor was one of the poorest\nareas in Southeast Asia. Based on Indonesian statistics, social indicators prior to the upheaval\nalready  demonstrated  a  low  level  of  human  development,  with  some  50  percent  of  the\npopulation clustered around the poverty line. The situation has worsened dramatically since\nSeptember 1999.\n113. ADB\u2019s core development tenet is to combat poverty. Its commitment in East Timor is to\nprovide well-coordinated action to support reconstruction and long-term development planning,\nas well as humanitarian relief. This is being done by, among others, working to reduce poverty,\nwith particular attention to ensuring quality basic service delivery, opportunities for productive\nsector development, and provision of associated infrastructure needs.\n114. Prior to the upheaval, less than half of the population had access to safe water and\nsanitation  facilities.  Insufficient  water  constrained  sanitation  practices,  which  were  often\nnonhygienic. Lack of sanitation facilities caused major health hazards in poorer rural and urban\nareas. Poor households were further disadvantaged by having limited access to basic health\nand  education  services.  With  almost  the  entire  East  Timor  population  suffering  from  the\ndestruction, the need for repair and rehabilitation of water supplies and sanitation facilities is\nnow even higher.\n115. The Project directly addresses and seeks to overcome a number of factors that directly,\nor indirectly, contribute to poverty. WSSRP-1 was designed to distribute its benefits in an\nequitable manner across East Timorese urban and rural communities and the Project provides\nincreased emphasis on community WS&S in subdistrict and rural areas. The Project will be\nresponsive to communities\u2019 needs, contribute to sustainable and participatory development and\noperation in the WS&S sector, reduce poverty, and minimize environmental impacts. It will\ntarget communities where the need is greatest and where poorer people live (rural villages and\nperi-urban areas). It will consider the different needs of men and women and of the old and\nyoung. Where applicable, it will adopt approaches to WS&S that counteract the problems faced\nby poor households in respect of service charges. In all areas, rehabilitation and improvement of\nwater supplies will free labor (both men and women) for more productive uses, thereby assisting\nin the fight against poverty. Improved sanitation facilities and practices, and the provision of\nclean water will have beneficial health effects, particularly on children and infants, and reduce\nthe costs associated with disease and morbidity. This effect will particularly benefit the poor for\nwhom the costs of illness can be devastating.\nD.  Risks and Mitigating Measures\n116. The major risks and proposed mitigating measures are as follows:\n(i)  WSS  capacity  constraints,  i.e.,  the  limited  capacity  of  WSS  management  to\nparticipate  in  project  activities  including  design  and  supervision.  Mitigating", "23\nmeasures  include  (a)  utilizing  PMU  resources  and  external  consultants  to\nundertake most of design and supervision activities, and (b) maximizing use of\ntraining  and  demonstration  activities  for  WSS  capacity  building  during\nimplementation.\n(ii)  donor coordination, i.e., the potential for duplication (and omission) as the sector\nis crowded with a number of donors and programs overlap. Mitigating measures\ninclude (a) identifying overlaps through the framework prepared by the SMIF, (b)\nsupporting  WSS  major-sector  coordination  by  including  the  capacity  building\ncomponent in the proposed Project, and (c) participation of PMU advisers in\nWSS sector coordination arrangements involving major donors.\n(iii)  community participation, i.e., the possibility that communities may be unwilling to\nparticipate  in  projects  because  of  economic  constraints  and  experience  with\ntemporary  employment  projects  during  the  emergency  phase.  Mitigating\nmeasures  include  (a)  a  uniform  policy  on  donors'  community  participation\nprojects, (b) use of NGOs with local and sector experience, (c) involving all\nstakeholders from day 1 of the Project, and (d) empowering the community\nthrough  participatory  rapid  appraisal  methods  and  building  capacity  around\ncommunity-defined goals.\n(iv)  NGO capacity constraints, i.e., the limited capacity of NGOs, particularly local\nNGOs,  for  implementing  repair  and  rehabilitation  activities  and  associated\ncommunity and capacity building activities in districts. A measure for mitigating\nthis risk is selecting either international or local NGOs currently working in the\nsector and the districts.\n(v)  procurement, i.e., delays in appointment of consultants, NGOs, suppliers, and\ncontractors to implement the various activities. Mitigating measures will include\n(a)  early  preparation  of  and  agreement  on  a  detailed  program,  (b)  advance\nplanning by PMU advisers, and (c) simplification of procurement by appropriate\npackaging and streamlining or fast-tracking of ADB procedures.\nVI.

Sector Status Prior to the Postconsultation Violence\n1. Subsequent to the upheaval in September 1999 and the establishment of the United\nNations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET), extensive work was undertaken to\nassess the status of the water supply and sanitation (WS&S) sector. Key findings of a Joint\nAssessment  Mission  conducted  in  October  and  November  1999  are  in  the  Infrastructure\nBackground  Paper.1  Subsequently,  extensive  investigations  were  undertaken  by  an  ADB\nmission in preparing the Trust Fund for East Timor (TFET) Project.2 The following details\nsummarize the above documents and update them from field information as appropriate.\n1. Water Supply\n2. Extensive public water supply networks covered the 13 district capitals and reportedly all\nof the 62 subdistrict towns. Details available indicate a total of 44 discrete systems, 13 serving\ndistrict capitals and 31 serving subdistrict towns and villages.3\n3. Of the 31 systems serving subdistrict towns and villages, 16 were ibu kota kecamatan or\nsub-district capital (IKK) systems and 15 were proyek penyediaan sarana air bersih or clean\nwater facility installation project (PPSAB) systems. IKK systems were operated by the 13 district\nwater enterprises (PDAM or BPAM), which also operated the systems for the district capitals.\nConsumers of the PDAM or BPAM systems were charged a tariff for supply of water. The\nPPSAB systems were implemented by the Indonesian Government through central Government\nfunding. The recipient communities were responsible for operation and maintenance of the\nsystems. It appears that a number of other public water supply systems were not managed by\nthe district water companies. The existence, origin, and status of such systems are yet to be\ndetermined.\n4. A master plan was prepared for the Dili water supply system in 1998 with assistance\nfrom the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID)4.\n5. Overall coverage5 provided by the public water supply system was assessed at 36\npercent. In the district capitals, this figure rose to 39 percent and in the subdistrict towns and\nvillages served by the public systems this reduced to 29 percent. A summary of the towns and\nvillages with public water supply networks is in Table A2.1.\n                                                \n1 Joint Assessment Mission, Infrastructure Background Paper, 1999.\n2 The Mission comprised W.

The quality of the public water supply systems was problematic, with many of them\npoorly planned, designed, and operated. Typically deficiencies included low service coverage,\npoor  maintenance,  high  levels  of  unaccounted-for  water,  intermittent  supply,  inappropriate\ntreatment systems, poor water quality particularly from surface water sources during the wet\nseason, and frequent failure due to flood and landslide damage to transmission pipelines.\n7. In the urban areas of Dili and other towns, extensive use was made of private shallow\nwells.", "36\nAppendix 2, page 3\n8. Villages and rural areas not served by the public water supply systems had extensive\ncommunity-owned and -operated piped systems. Some received water from public systems and\nothers sourced water from small springs or streams. Villages and rural areas, especially those\nnear the sea or on river plains, also used shallow wells. It was estimated that 48 percent of the\ntotal population of East Timor had access to safe water.6  This figure is probably optimistic.\n9. The status of use of various water sources in East Timor is summarized in Table A2.2.\nTable A2.2:  Water Source Utilizationa\nApproximate % of Population Using Source\nWater Sourceb\nEast Timor Dili\nPiped system 13 41\nPump 10 37\nWell 10 7\nSpring 61 13\nRiver 6 2\nRain - -\nOthers - -\na  SUSENAS Census,1998.\nb  There is potential for confusion between source and type of system in this table.\n2. Sanitation and Liquid Waste\n10. No towns in East Timor had sewers. Liquid wastes were disposed of via \u201cseptic tanks\u201d7\nor directly into the drainage system. In Dili, less than half of the houses had septic tanks. In\nother towns the situation is less clear, but coverage is generally less than in Dili. The high water\ntables in many parts of Dili present a problem in disposing septic tank effluent, and systems are\ngenerally not designed for these conditions.\n11. There were no facilities for treating and disposing septic tank sludge or other liquid\nwastes. Tanker trucks were available to desludge septic tanks, but it was usual for sludge to be\ndischarged indiscriminately, often into nearby drains. There were no significant generators of\nnon-domestic liquid waste in Dili nor in other East Timor towns.\n12. Table A2.3 indicates the excreta disposal methods used in East Timor and in Dili. It is\ndifficult to estimate the level of acceptable sanitation coverage.  Data from the Indonesian\nadministration  indicates  that  38  percent  of  the  population  of  East  Timor  had  access  to\nsanitation.  This figure is probably optimistic.\n13. Institutional responsibility for sanitation under the Indonesian administration rested with\nthe provincial and district Dinas Kesehatan or health offices (DiKes). In Dili, the DiKes within the\nDili city administration was responsible for desludging of the septic tanks as well as other\nfunctions (solid waste collection and disposal, street cleaning, parks and gardens, drainage\nmaintenance).\n                                                \n6 UNDP Common Country Assessment. DiKesTk. I. Health Profile. 1998.\n7 The term \u201cseptic tank\u201d is often used erroneously to refer to a cesspit connected to a pour flush toilet.", "37\nAppendix 2, page 4\n3. Solid Waste\n14. A collection system for solid waste was available in most towns, with waste being\ndeposited in strategically located collection boxes. A disposal site existed in Dili and some other\ntowns.  The  capacity  of  the  collection  systems  was  grossly  inadequate,  and  indiscriminate\ndumping of wastes in drains and on roadsides was widespread. The construction and operation\nof solid waste disposal sites were questionable. Significant quantities of waste were disposed of\nby burning.\n15. In Dili, solid waste management was the responsibility of the Dinas Kebersihan within\nthe Dili city administration. In the districts, this responsibility rested with the district public works\ndepartment (Dinas PU).\nTable A2.3:  Excreta Disposal Methodsa\nApproximate % of Population Using Method\nDisposal Method\nEast Timor Dili\nPrivate toilet with septic tank 10 34\nPrivate toilet without septic tank 15 23\nShared toilet 6 6\nPublic toilet 11 1\nDirect to cesspit 23 16\nBushes, forest, yard 29 7\nPond - -\nRiver, stream 4 -\nOthers 12 1\na  \nSUSENAS Census, 1998.\n4. Drainage\n16. Except in Dili, the drainage systems in most towns comprised a network of minor street\ndrains and were not of major significance. No doubt there are problem areas where the drains\nwere smelly because of the discharge of septic tank effluent and/or grey water, exacerbated by\nsolid waste deposited in the drains and lack of regular maintenance. Occasional flooding could\noccur during the wet season.\n17. In  Dili,  the  major  drainage  system  constructed  during  the  Portuguese  period  was\nsubsequently extended during the Indonesian period. The Dili drainage system had been poorly\nmaintained and badly neglected for many years. Deficiencies included poorly designed and\npoorly  constructed  drains  (frequently  lacking  level  control),  significant  solid  waste  and  silt\ndeposition reducing the drain cross-section, broken roadside entry pits, and broken or missing\ndrain covers. The drains were breeding grounds for vermin and insects and were a significant\nhealth  hazard.  Lack  of  maintenance  combined  with  poor  design  and  construction  caused\nflooding during the wet season.\n18. A master plan for Dili drainage was prepared in 1995, but has not been implemented.\n19. The responsibility for urban drainage in Indonesia has always been unclear but in Dili,\nthe Dinas Kebersihan within the city administration was responsible for maintaining  the system.", "38\nAppendix 2, page 5\n5. Water Resource Management\n20. Rainfall records were kept during the Portuguese era, with complete records for 1952-\n1974 available from at least 14 recording stations with a wide geographical spread. During the\nperiod of Indonesian administration, rainfall data collection was less well-organized. The Bureau\nof Meteorology maintained some stations, but experience indicates that processed data was\nunreliable. The water resources section of Public Works installed small but complete climate\nstations (data for precipitation, temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, wind speed and\ndirection)  in  irrigation  areas,  but  these  often  fell  into  a  state  of  disuse  a  short  time  after\ninstallation, mainly because of insufficient operating budgets, and any collected data was not\nreadily available.\n21. Stream gauging was the responsibility of the water resources section of Public Works,\nbut gauging stations were often improperly installed, especially in areas of shifting stream\ncourses. The number and location of stream gauging stations are unknown.\n22. Groundwater monitoring was not generally included in the Public Works groundwater\nexploration programs. Most exploration was concentrated in areas where there was potential for\nusing groundwater for irrigation. The Ministry of Works and Energy, through the Directorate of\nEnvironmental  Geology  Groundwater  Section,  had  responsibility  for  mapping  groundwater\nresources throughout Indonesia, but because of a lack of funding and difficult access, only a few\nboreholes were drilled in East Timor.\n23. Institutional  arrangements  for  water  resource  investigation  and  management  were\ndiffused, with the ministries of agriculture and forestry, public works, mines and energy, and, to\na small extent, health and environment having some role. Interagency coordination was poor,\nand most data collected was not readily available to potential users. Where data was available\nin processed form, the reliability was generally low.\nB. Impact of the Violence and the Indonesian Withdrawal\n1. Water Supply\n24. The major impacts are in the urban areas where the destruction was most extensive.\nThe key impacts may be summarised as follows:\n(i)  The institutions responsible for water supply operation and maintenance ceased\nto  exist  after  the  Indonesian  withdrawal.  While  many  of  the  technical  and\nadministrative support staff were East Timorese, the majority of the management\nand professional staff of the PDAM/BPAMs were Indonesian and their departure\nhad significant implications for human resource capacity. (Many technical staff\nfrom  the  former  water  enterprises  have  assisted  in  the  process  of  restoring\nsupplies.)\n(ii)  The institutional infrastructure including buildings and other assets, technical and\nfinancial records, vehicles, tools, and equipment were either stolen or destroyed.\n(iii)  Consumer connections were generally destroyed with the widespread destruction\nof the houses that they served.", "39\nAppendix 2, page 6\n(iv)  The large numbers of displaced persons that have moved into the urban areas,\nparticularly in Dili, caused further damage as they attempted to access water\nsupply through illegal connection and physical damage to pipes.\n(v)  Damage to major installations such as treatment plants was limited. Some bores\nwere destroyed and the pumps and/or electrical switchboards removed. In some\ninstances, bore casings were filled with rocks.\n(vi)  Damage to power supplies impacted on pumped systems causing significant\nproblems especially in the early period after the Indonesian withdrawal.\n25. Anecdotal  information  indicates  that  damage  to  rural  supplies  was  not  extensive.\nHowever,  there  were  pockets  of  damage  where  sources  such  as  shallow  wells  were\ncontaminated.\n2. Sanitation and Liquid Waste\n26. Damage to sanitation facilities occurred as houses were destroyed. In addition facilities\nfor maintaining and desludging septic tanks no longer exist. With the destruction of houses and\nthe displacement of residents, access to higher order sanitation systems in the urban areas has\ndecreased. The damage to water supplies has also impacted on water availability and use for\nsanitation.\n27. Anecdotal evidence indicates limited impact on sanitation systems in rural areas.\n3. Solid Waste\n28. There  was  no  solid  waste  management  system  in  Dili  after  the  pre-independence\nwithdrawal. Previous systems involved both community and institutional participation in solid\nwaste collection, cartage, and disposal. Equipment (handcarts and trucks) used for collection\nand  transport  has  been  either  destroyed,  diverted  to  other  uses,  or  removed.  The Dinas\nKebersihan within  the  former  Dili  city  administration  no  longer  exists.  Markets  had  been\ndestroyed but solid waste was still generated from market activities, as informal markets have\nestablished on roadsides.\n29. While the solid waste collection systems in other rural areas were less extensive, most\nhad some form of collection and disposal. The equipment previously used has been either\ndestroyed or removed. The community and institutional systems for collection and disposal are\nno longer operating.\n30. The large expatriate presence has a significant impact on the generation of solid waste,\nparticularly items such as bottled water containers, soft drinks and beer cans, and a general\nincrease in the importation of consumer goods. These problems are particularly apparent in Dili.\n31. The  general  destruction  has  created  significant  additional  quantities  of  solid  waste\nincluding building rubble, roofing material, car bodies, etc. Much of this still litters Dili streets\nbecause there is no capacity to collect and dispose of it. Asbestos waste is mixed with the\nrubble.", "40\nAppendix 2, page 7\n4. Drainage\n32. There was no obvious damage to the drainage systems during the violence. Even before\nthe  Indonesian  withdrawal,  the  systems  had  gradually  deteriorated  because  of  lack  of\nmaintenance and increasing use of drains as receiving areas for solid waste including building\nrubble. Equipment used for maintenance by the Dinas Kebersihan including a jet pump for drain\nflushing has been removed or destroyed.\n33. The impact in smaller towns and rural areas is less severe, but similar problems exist on\na smaller scale.\n5. Water Resource Management\n34. Institutional structures and systems for water supply no longer exist. Any water resource\nrecords were probably either removed or destroyed during the Indonesian withdrawal. It is\nunlikely that physical assets such as stream gauging stations were damaged, although it is\nextremely likely that many of them are no longer in operating condition.\n35. The  greatest  potential  impact8  on  water  resources  since  the  pre-independence\nwithdrawal is deforestation of catchment areas, in particular those around Dili and the larger\ntowns. Kerosene stoves were very common during the pre-independence administration, and\nkerosene fuel was subsidized as one of the basic family needs along with rice, cooking oil, flour,\nand salt. With the stoves reportedly removed or destroyed, the remaining population have been\nforced to rely heavily on firewood. Kerosene is now far more expensive, and even if it were\naffordable, the majority of the population still cannot afford to replace stoves. Widespread\nunemployment has forced many people to rely on firewood collection as a source of income.\nTraditionally, firewood collectors only took branches from trees which would recover during the\nfollowing wet season (eucalyptus mainly), but the \"new\" collectors are cutting down all types of\ntrees to maximize the amount of firewood collected. Reforestation has commenced in a small\nway, and some project funding is being provided to assist in propagating seedlings and run an\ninformation-education-communication  campaign  about  deforestation  and  its  impacts.  Some\nfunding is reportedly available for disseminating designs for fuel-efficient woodstoves to reduce\nthe rate of consumption of firewood.\nC. Initial Rehabilitation and Planned Donor Activities\n36. This  section  summarizes  the  initial  rehabilitation  efforts  and  the  major  current  and\nplanned external assistance activities in the sector. Additional information is in Appendix 4.\n1. Institutional Arrangements\n37. The Water and Sanitation Service (WSS) has been established and is operating. While\nthere is some uncertainty about its role and responsibility, particularly its capacity to sustainably\nmanage WS&S systems below the district capital level, the organization now has staff appointed\nin all districts, is managing 13 public water supply systems, and has begun the essential policy\ndevelopment and capacity building required to develop its capacity to deliver services.\n                                                \n8 Tais Timor (Local UNTAET Newsletter), 22 October 2000.", "41\nAppendix 2, page 8\n38. The  strategic  plan  for  WSS9  envisages  broad  responsibilities  for  the  organization\nincluding water policy/water resource management, water supply, sanitation, solid waste, and\ndrainage. Under the Indonesian administration, these functions were fragmented across several\nministries and levels of government.\n39. However, WSS is a new agency that is developing its staff, institutional infrastructure,\npolicies and legislation, and operational and management systems. WSS requires significant\ncapacity building and is constrained in undertaking its broader responsibilities by insufficient\nhuman resources as a consequence of UNTAET-imposed staffing ceilings.\n40. Rehabilitation is thus being undertaken in an evolving institutional and policy framework\nand significant resource constraints in all areas of WSS. The organization will play a key role in\ncoordinating the wide range of aid activities for the sector, but there a need for flexibility in\nplanning and implementation to ensure that activities comply with WSS requirements as they\nevolve.\n2. Water Supply and Sanitation\n41. Since  the  destruction  of  September  1999,  progress  has  been  significant  in  both\nemergency system repairs and planning for more substantial rehabilitation and augmentation of\nWS&S  systems.  Appendix  4  lists  the  major  external  assistance  activities  by  multilateral\nagencies,  bilateral  sources,  and  NGOs.  The  major  interventions  in  this  area  include  the\nfollowing.\n42. The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) has completed the Study on Urgent\nImprovement for Water Supply Systems in East Timor. This study covers 15 towns including Dili\nand 12 district capitals (excluding Oecusse) plus the townships of Ermera (Ermera), Maubisse\n(Ainaro), and Vila/Beloi on Atauro Island. The study produced asset mapping and condition\nsurveys of the water supply facilities in each town and a feasibility study for a proposed three-\nyear rehabilitation plan. Currently being considered is funding for implementation in some 2-5\ntowns selected from Liquica, Lospalos, Ainaro, Suai, and Maliana.\n43. In association with the study, JICA also provided about $1 million to fund a number of\nimmediate implementation projects for leakage control in Dili; new water resource facilities in\nManatuto; rehabilitation of bores in Dili, Hera, and Liquica; and WS&S for schools.\n44. Japan has committed some $11.28 million to the planning, design, and implementation\nof improvements to the urban water supply for Dili. Planning for this phase was completed and\nimplementation began in March 2001. This activity is funded through the Government of Japan\nand implementation is managed by the United Nations Office of Project Services.\n45. Australia has given significant funding for emergency rehabilitation activities undertaken\nthrough NGOs such as Oxfam and Bia Hula. It has also provided substantial assistance to WSS\nthrough the Staffing Assistance Program for East Timor (SAPET) and the Capacity Building\nProgram for East Timor (CAPET). Further capacity building assistance totalling $1.5 million is\nplanned  during  2001-2003.  In  addition,  Australia  plans  to  provide  $8  million  for  a\ncommunity/rural WS&S program, which will focus on the districts of Kova Lima, Bobonaro, and\nViqueque over three 3 years commencing by September 2001.\n                                                \n9  Office of Water and Sanitation. Draft Strategic Plan for the Establishment of an East Timor Government Water &\nSanitation Institution. March 2000.", "42\nAppendix 2, page 9\n46. Portugal is funding a range of activities covering water, sanitation and solid waste. IPE-\nAguas de Portugal (Aquapor) is undertaking a range of water supply system rehabilitation\nmeasures in Aileu and Baucau. Portugal's total commitment to date is approximately $2.5\nmillion (including some studies for solid waste and sewerage), of which $1 million is for activities\nplanned for rehabilitation in 2001, primarily in Baucau.\n47. Germany is funding water supply system rehabilitation in the districts of Baucau and\nViqueque. The German Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ) is the primary funding and\nimplementing agency with some additional funding from Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW).\nThe focus is on the district capital of Viqueque and in seven subdistrict centers. The GTZ\nbudget is $1.6 million for two years with an extension of two years planned. KfW is understood\nto be contributing $0.5 million (DM1.0 million) to this work.\n48. The Canadian International Development Agency recently committed $2 million over\nthree years to implement rural WS&S programs in Aileu, Ainaro and Lautem. Implementation\nwill be undertaken by Care Canada commencing in the second quarter of 2001.\n49. The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) is implementing a program on WS&S for\nschools, which will cover some 200 schools by June 2001. In implementing this work, UNICEF\nis working with former Government of Indonesia Health Department sanitarians who have\nestablished a local NGO (East Timor Sanitarians Association) for WS&S sector activities. The\nUNICEF activities include WS&S and health promotion education for teachers. UNICEF is also\npromoting the local manufacture of components (pour flush toilets, well rings) for rural WS&S\nsystems through technical assistance and training of village entrepreneurs.\n50. International nongovernment organizations (NGOs) working in association with local\nNGOs or community-based organizations have done extensive works in several districts. The\nmost significant are the following.\n(i)  Oxfam has undertaken extensive water supply rehabilitation in Dili and in district\ncapitals and subdistrict areas in Liquica, Oecusse, and Kova Lima. This work\nfocused initially on the district capitals at the request of UNTAET, but the focus is\nincreasingly  shifting  to  subdistricts  and  rural  areas.  Hygiene  promotion  and\nsanitation programs are being incorporated into the activities.\n(ii)  Action Contre la Faim (ACF) has undertaken extensive works in Manatuto and\nErmera districts. As in Oxfam, the focus initially was on the district capitals, but is\nshifting to subdistricts. Some hygiene education and sanitation programs are also\nbeing undertaken.\n(iii)  Care undertook water source cleaning and rehabilitation focusing on Kova Lima.\nCare also plans WS&S for rural areas with a budget of some $2.5 million over\nthree years, possibly in the districts of Ainaro, Manufahi, and/or Aileu.\n(iv)  The  International  Committee  of  the  Red  Cross  assisted  with  emergency\nrehabilitation of transmission mains and water treatment plants in Dili; the repair\nof hand pumps in peri-urban systems in Dili; and rural WS&S activities in Aileu,\nAinaro, Baucau, and Ermera.\n51. The European Community Humanitarian Office is planning to fund WS&S for schools in\ncoordination with UNICEF, with implementation undertaken by a number of international NGOs.", "43\nAppendix 2, page 10\n52. The Community Empowerment and Local Governance Project (CEP) is providing funds\nfor local development projects at the village level. Approximately 50 percent of the project\nfunding is allocated to social infrastructure (including water supply). Based on a small sample of\nsecond round proposals received to date, water could account for some 10-20 percent of total\nCEP funding.\n3. Dili Sewerage and Sanitation\n53. To accommodate the influx of UNTAET and peacekeeping forces (PKF) personnel, a\nnumber  of  barrack-type  complexes  have  been  constructed  and  septic  tank  and\nevapotranspiration disposal systems installed. Some are not operating correctly due to design\nand/or construction deficiencies and unacceptable effluent discharges to the surface. UNTAET\nhas also contracted a private sector firm to desludge septic tanks and cesspits. This service is\nlimited to UNTAET/PKF facilities generally. PKF has constructed a lagoon treatment plant to\nreceive and treat liquid wastes from these sources. The facility has limited capacity for the\ncurrent waste load. Further, the current management responsibility for this facility is not clear.\n54. Portugal is funding a study on sewerage and sanitation being undertaken for central Dili.\nThe draft report was recently released and is being reviewed by WSS.\n4. Solid Waste\n55. Short-term temporary measures have been implemented to manage solid waste in Dili to\ndate. They have included a number of employment-generating schemes for street cleaning,\ncollection, and disposal at the disposal site in Tibar. UNTAET has contracted private sector\nfirms  to  collect  its  waste.  The  service  provided  has  been  limited.  Burning  of  waste  by\nhouseholds is prevalent as are indiscriminate dumping and disposal to drains, roadsides, etc.\nThe temporary employment-generating schemes are winding down and there are no plans for\ncontinuing similar activities.\n56. Portugal has undertaken studies on solid waste management in Dili and the districts.\nDraft reports were issued in late 2000. They included recommendations for Dili incorporating\nurban street cleaning, collection and transport of solid waste, and rehabilitation of the solid\nwaste disposal site at Tibar. Portugal will not fund the implementation of these proposals.\n5. Drainage\n57. No systematic work has been done on Dili drainage. Some minor works were done at\nthe end of 1999 in preparation for the wet season. Dili district has undertaken a limited program\nto construct concrete covers to replace broken drain covers.\n58. The disposal of solid waste including general garbage and building waste into drains\ncontinues. The practice reduces the capacity of the drains to handle flood flows and provides a\nbreeding ground for insects and vermin. Sediment deposition and agricultural activities in some\nmajor drains are also of concern. Some maintenance work in Dili District has been undertaken\nwith short-term assistance from PKF resources.", "44\nAppendix 2, page 11\n6. Water Resource Management\n59. Responsibility for water resource management has been assigned to WSS; however, at\nthis stage there has been no organizational or physical progress due to budget and staffing\nconstraints (water supply has a higher priority).", "45\nAppendix 3, page 1\nWATER AND SANITATION SERVICE DRAFT STRATEGIC PLAN AND\nORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE\n1. The Water and Sanitation Service (WSS) March 2000 draft strategic plan gives\nthe overarching goal or mission statement for WSS:\n\"To  ensure  the  communities  of  East  Timor  have  access  to  such  water  &\nsanitation services as are considered essential for public health, protection of the\nenvironment and for promotion of economic growth.\"\n2. To achieve this mission, WSS has determined the following four main key areas\nof responsibility (in order of priority based mainly on expected immediate health benefit):\n(i) urban water supply\n(ii) community (i.e. rural) water supply and sanitation\n(iii) urban sanitation (i.e. drainage, wastewater, and solid waste)\n(iv) water resources\n3. Objectives determined for each area are detailed in the draft strategic plan. To\nachieve  the  stated  objectives,  an  organization/staffing  structure  and  budget  were\nproposed for FY 2000/01.\n4. Unfortunately, the East Timor recurrent budget constraints necessitated a budget\nreduction of approximately 50 percent, and staff reduction of approximately 60 percent.\nThe budget constraints, combined with numerous international staffing shortcomings,\nhas  allowed  WSS  to  focus  only  on  urban  water  supply  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,\ncommunity water supply and sanitation, to date.\nA. Urban Water Supply\n5. WSS is currently managing the operation and maintenance (O&M) of urban\nwater supplies in Dili and 12 district main towns. Levels of service are sufficient to\nachieve basic health objectives, although water quality is, at best, marginal. The longer\nterm objectives are continual improvement, and the management of water supplies in 62\ntownships (i.e., all district and subdistrict main towns previously supplied with water\nsupply systems by the Government of Indonesia).\n6. The  achievement  and  sustainability  of  this  ultimate  objective  dependent  on\nincreased  budget  (primarily  sourced  from  water-user  charges)  and  local  staffing\nallocations.  WSS  is  currently  in  the  planning  and  resourcing  stages  for  the\nimplementation of water-user charges.\nB. Community (Rural) Water Supply and Sanitation\n7. Some 70 percent of the population of East Timor live outside urban areas. The\nprovision of community-managed and -operated small water supply systems will allow\nthis large population to access piped water at minimal cost to East Timor's recurrent\nbudget.  Community  management  usually  results  in  a  lower  cost  to  users  of  small\nsystems, but is usually accompanied by a lower, but acceptable, level of service.", "46\nAppendix 3, page 2\n8. The  WSS  objective  is  to  facilitate  the  provision  of  adequate,  safe,  and\nsustainable water supplies for the rural communities. The establishment of community-\nmanaged  water  supplies  is  a  lengthy  process,  requiring  extensive  community\nconsultation and participation to ensure sustainability. WSS has accessed substantial\nexternal resources to achieve this objective. Such external funding usually includes\nsmall-scale sanitation improvements and environmental health education.\nC. Urban Sanitation (i.e., Drainage, Wastewater, and Solid Waste)\n9. Solid waste collection to date has been undertaken by district administrations in\nan ad hoc manner and with variable success. There is an increasing need to implement\nmore sustainable waste collection and safe disposal arrangements. WSS has initiated\ndiscussions with Dili District to implement such arrangements through the private sector\nand to encourage waste minimization.\n10. Recent heavy rains have highlighted the need for proactive activities in drainage.\nAlthough flooding is a transitory inconvenience, it does decrease road pavement life and\ncreates  disease  vector  breeding  sites.  Again,  there  is  an  urgent  need  to  maintain\nexisting drains and undertake drainage improvements.\n11. East Timor's recurrent budget allocations are needed to implement drainage\nmaintenance and waste collection and disposal, although some minor external funding\nhas  been  accessed  to  undertake  one-off  activities.  WSS  recently  recruited  an\ninternational staff member to focus solely on achieving sustainable urban sanitation\narrangements. WSS is confident such arrangements will be implemented within the next\nsix months, provided budget allocations are forthcoming.\nD. Water Resources\n12. The assessment, responsible allocation, and adequate protection of East Timor's\nsurface and underground freshwater supplies are vital to the sustainable provision of\nwater supply at the lowest possible cost. To date, budget and staffing restrictions have\nprevented WSS from undertaking any significant activities in this very important area.\nExternal funds may become available in the future, but will depend on East Timor\nidentifying water resource management as a priority funding area.\nE.

Water and Sanitation Sector Coordination of Donor Projects\n13. WSS is currently managing the implementation or preparation of donor projects\nwith a total value of some $28 million. The projects include the Trust Fund for East\nTimor-Phase I, AusAID's Capacity Assistance Project for East Timor (CAPET) and East\nTimor  Water  and  Sanitation  Service  Rural  Partnership  Scheme,  Government  of\nPortugal's Water Supply Rehabilitation, and JICA's Dili Water Supply Improvement.\n14. All  projects  include  significant  capacity-building  components.  The  CAPET\nprogram, in particular, will place experienced technical advisers as counterparts to most\nWSS divisional managers.\n15.

Introduction\n1. The Project\u2019s environmental impact is classified as category B. An initial environmental\nexamination (IEE) of the Project was carried out in accordance with the Asian Development\nBank (ADB)'s Environmental Assessment Requirements.1 The summary IEE (SIEE) was based\non information in the IEE, which reviewed all project components to identify potential sources of\nenvironmental impacts, appropriate mitigation measures, and a monitoring plan.\nB. Project Description\n1. Rationale\n2. The United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) is executing a\nprogram of humanitarian assistance in East Timor, part of which involves rehabilitation of water\nsupply  and  sanitation  (WS&S)  facilities  damaged  during  the  September  1999  crisis.  The\nchallenge, however, is not just a matter of restoring the facilities, but ensuring sustainability and\ncost recovery can be achieved in the postcrisis environment. While emergency assistance and\nsupport under the Water Supply and Sanitation Rehabilitation Program, Phase I (WSSRP-1)\nhave repaired and rehabilitated existing water supply systems in Dili and the district capital\ntowns,  WS&S  coverage  remains  below  developing  country  targets,  and  service  coverage\nimprovement will require additional sector investment over the coming years.\n3. While the Water and Sanitation Service (WSS) has progressed significantly since its\nestablishment  and  currently  has  an  operational  unit  in  each  district  capital,  the  remaining\nchallenges  are  significant.  WSSRP-1  is  providing  substantial  assistance  to  strengthen  the\ninstitutional capacity of WSS and to rehabilitate priority public and community WS&S systems in\nDili  and  districts.  However,  WSS  capacity  to  plan,  develop,  operate,  and  maintain  WS&S\nsystems requires strengthening through further support for policy and systems development and\ntraining.\n2. Objectives\n4. The  Project  will  (i)  extend  the  operation  of  the  Project  Management  Unit  (PMU)\nestablished  under  UNTAET\u2019s  WSS  to  manage  project  implementation  for  15  months;  (ii)\nimplement  a  capacity  building  and  institutional  development  follow-up  program  to  further\nstrengthen the capacity of WSS to deliver services in accordance with its strategic plan; and\nundertake a WS&S implementation program covering public water supply systems in Dili and\ndistrict towns, community WS&S systems, and priority urban sanitation improvements.\n5. The immediate benefits of the Project include (i) improved WS&S, and (ii) enhanced\nquality of life for people in both urban and rural areas whose attempts to improve their status\nand health are continually impeded by the need to divert time, energy, and financial resources\nto acquire their daily water needs. The Project will generate employment for local labor, thus\nhelping to create a stable social and economic environment. The Project is expected to directly\n                  \n1 Office of Environment and Social Development. 1998. Environmental Assessment Requirements of the Asian\nDevelopment Bank.

It is designed to distribute its\nbenefits in an equitable manner across East Timorese urban and rural communities, thus\ncontributing  to  sustainable  development  and  operation  in  the  WS&S  sector  and  reducing\npoverty.\n3. Description\n6. The Project will have the following components: (i) extension of the operation of the\nPMU  under  WSS;  (ii)  implementation  of  a  capacity  building  and  institutional  development\nprogram that will identify and implement priority policy, human resources development, and\ninstitutional support activities as well as support physical reconstruction already under way or\nbeing planned; and (iii) formulation of a WS&S implementation program comprising (a) WS&S\nquick-response facility, (b) Dili water supply rehabilitation and improvement to complement the\nworks being undertaken by other donors, and (c) district town (public) water supply rehabilitation\nand improvement in coordination with plans and implementation activities being undertaken by\nother donors; (d) community water supply and sanitation rehabilitation and improvement using\nappropriate and sustainable approaches through nongovernment organizations and/or other aid\nprograms;  and  (e)  assistance  to  priority  urban  sanitation  rehabilitation  and  improvement\nincluding drainage, and solid waste and human waste management.\n7. The Project, particularly the WS&S implementation program, will have the following\nactivities:\n(i)  Water supplies. The Project will rehabilitate and improve existing public piped\nwater supply systems and community water supply schemes. Rehabilitation of\nexisting and construction of augmented facilities will involve providing pipelines,\npumping stations, treatment plants, and storage spaces.\n(ii)  Sanitation. There are no communal or public sewerage systems in East Timor.\nImproved  latrines,  where  they  occur,  dispose  of  effluent  in  septic  tanks  or\nsoakage  pits.  The  Project  will  rehabilitate  or  repair  some  damaged,  on-site\ndisposal  facilities  associated  with  markets,  schools,  clinics,  etc.  in  the  main\ntowns. Appropriate technology options will be utilized. As part of WS&S system\nimplementation,  community  awareness  programs  will  encourage  the  use  of\nimproved environmental sanitation practices and behavior.\n(iii)  Drainage.  The  Project  will  rehabilitate  selected,  damaged  drainage  works  at\nappropriate locations.\n(iv)  Solid  waste  management.  The  Project  will  support  solid  waste  collection  in\npriority  areas,  mainly  in  Dili.  Proposals  will  be  developed  to  encourage  the\ninvolvement of private sector resources in providing this service.\nC. Description of the Environment\n1. Physical Environment\n8. Timor is the largest and easternmost island in the Lesser Sunda Archipelago. East Timor\ncomprises the eastern half of Timor Island. East Timor has a contiguous area of 19,000 square\nkilometers (km2), and an additional 2,461 km2 in the Oecusse-Ambino enclave inside West\nTimor.", "67\nAppendix 9, page 3\n9. The island is along the junction of the Australian and the Asian geological plates and is\nthus  subject  to  frequent  earthquakes.  The  rock  formations  are  primarily  sedimentary  karst\nuplifted by the collision of the two plates. As the formation is recent, the karst is highly fractured\nand crumbles easily. Metamorphic rock from past volcanic activity is limited to the northern and\ncentral sections of the island. The high erosion rate from the crumbling karst layers has resulted\nin the formation of alluvial plains and isolated fertile valleys.\n10. The main geographic feature is the mountain range that runs east-west along the center\nof the island and that causes watercourses to flow either north to the Banda Sea or south to the\nTimor Sea. Mountain peaks reach up to 3,000 meters in elevation, so watercourses are steep,\nfast flowing, and, because of the extended dry season, generally ephemeral. The river systems\nare short, cutting deep ravines into the unstable rock, forming deep canyons in the highlands,\nand abruptly widening as they reach the flat alluvial plains. Often the rivers narrow as they\napproach the sea because of obstruction caused by sandbars and intertidal deposits. Countless\nlittoral terraces of coral origin and some extensive plateaus, also of coral origin, characterize the\nnorth side of the island (e.g., Baucau and Laga). A few alluvial areas occur between Lautem\nand Baucau and in Manatuto District. The main plains to the north occur at Batugade, Lois\nstream, Dili, Manatuto, and Com. The south coast comprises a wide plain that extends from the\nborder east to Viqueque where it begins to narrow, through to Lore in Lautem District. The\nenclave of Oecusse-Ambino is also very mountainous with a narrow coastal strip. Here all\nstreams  flow  to  the  north.  The  volcanic  island  of  Atauro  rises  steeply  from  the  sea  to  a\nmaximum elevation of 999 meters on Mount Mano Coco.\n2. Climate and Water Resources\n11. Situated in the equatorial region, Timor has basically two annual seasons (wet and dry)\ninfluenced variously by the monsoon regime, proximity to the Australian continent, and locally by\nthe  orographic  effects  of  the  mountainous  topography.  The  wet  season,  which  lasts  from\nNovember to May, results from the northern monsoon. It is characterized by thunderstorms,\nhigh tropical rainfall and temperature, and concomitant humidity. During the dry season from\nJune to October, winds from the south bring little rainfall and result in lower temperatures.\nAnnual rainfall ranges from some 500 to 1,500 millimeters (mm) in the low-lying coastal areas to\nover 3,000 mm in the mountains. Depending on location, average wet season rainfall ranges\nfrom 70 percent (Kova-Lima) to 95 percent (Ambino) of annual rainfall. Districts along the\nnorthern  coastline  (Ambino,  Liquica,  Dili,  Manatuto,  and  Baucau)  have  the  lowest  rainfall,\nranging from about 500 mm in Manatuto to 800 mm in Ambino and Baucau, with over 90\npercent generally falling in the wet season.\n12. The hydrological regime depends primarily on the climatic conditions of the alternating\nwet and dry monsoon seasons. Rivers in the area are generally characterized by their relatively\nshort length, steep gradient, short flood peaks, very high sediment load, and mobile beds. In\nmany areas, river and stream crossings require frequent realignment and repair due to continual\nchanges in river channels. Sediments tend to be very coarse, with boulders and large gravel.\nThe mountainous topography and streamflow pattern makes the construction of dams and weirs\nproblematic.\n13. Because of the relatively high rainfall and abundant springs and surface water, and the\nsmall  population,  there  was  no  need  for  significant  groundwater  investigation  in  the  past.\nKnowledge of groundwater occurrence and quality is therefore limited. Groundwater is accessed\nin the mountain areas mainly through springs, which are commonly tapped at their source with\nwater  fed  by  gravity  to  towns  and  villages  through  small-diameter  pipelines,  often  many", "68\nAppendix 9, page 4\nkilometers long. Villagers along the coastal alluvial plains usually rely on open, hand-dug, wells\nfor their domestic supplies. In addition a number of towns in East Timor obtain at least part of\ntheir raw water from groundwater, via small-diameter deep bores equipped with bore pumps.\n14. Typically, surface water, where available in the dry season, is of acceptable quality. In\nthe wet season, however, turbidity is normally unacceptably high with consequent implications\nfor water treatment. In general, the quality of water from springs and groundwater sources is\nacceptable for most of the year, though often hard. Communities in coastal areas may also have\nthe additional problem of saltwater intrusion into wells. The generally unfavorable geology and\nsteep topography in East Timor exacerbate the normal water resources difficulties faced during\nthe dry season as rivers dry up and spring flows recede, often to very small flows. All this\ncombines to produce a hydrological environment in which securing safe and reliable water\nsources for town and village supplies is difficult. Recurrent droughts exacerbate this problem.\n3. Biological Environment\n15. Timor is on the eastern side of Wallace's Line. The flora and fauna are similar to that of\nthe tropical Australia-Pacific group. It has no large animals, but many small mammals, such as\ndeer,  and  brightly  colored  birds.  Timor  was  one  of  the  first  islands  settled  by  Europeans\nbecause of its proximity to the Spice Islands. A number of domesticated\u2013horses, cattle, chicken,\nand pigs\u2013and feral animals have been introduced in the islands. During the last 10 years,\ndeforestation was officially estimated at 70,000 hectares, with the unofficial estimate double this\nlevel. The central highlands are planted to coffee, which commands a high price in the world\nmarket because of its higher-than-normal alkaline properties. Rice, corn, sorghum, beans, and\nroot crops are grown in the lowlands. Slash-and-burn agriculture is common even on the steep\nhillsides. A major environmental issue is deforestation of catchment areas through timber cutting\nfor fuel, which has increased significantly since the Indonesian withdrawal, particularly in areas\naround Dili and the major towns.\n4. Sociocultural Environment\n16. Most of the population is concentrated in the northern coastal towns and in fertile valleys\nin the interior. The coastal flatlands in the south are sparsely populated because of the harsh\nmountain terrain that divides the island. Sea travel from the north to the south is constrained by\nstrong waves most of the year. The economy is based on agriculture, with coffee as the major\nexport crop. Surplus rice, corn, and other agricultural produce are consumed within the island.\nThere is little industry or manufacturing. A number of mineral deposits have been identified, but\ntheir commercial potential has not been explored. During the Indonesian period, the service\nindustry  was  limited  to  the  civil  service  and  state-owned  corporations,  such  as\ntelecommunications,  power  and  water,  and  oil  and  gas  distribution.  Trading  and  other\ncommercial  activities  were  limited  to  traditional  marketplaces  in  small  settlements.  Banks,\nrestaurants, hotels, and other businesses were mostly in the two large centers: Dili and Baucau.\nMost formal businesses were burned down during the postconsultation destruction.\n17. Almost  70  percent  of  the  schools  were  destroyed  during  the  postconsultation\ndestruction. School reconstruction has progressed significantly through other Trust Fund for\nEast Timor programs and support from other sources. Tetum is the local language, with Bahasa\nIndonesia and Portuguese spoken by sizable portions of the population. Almost 95 percent of\nthe population are Roman Catholics, and the Muslim and Protestant populations are small.", "69\nAppendix 9, page 5\n18. The dislocation of large numbers of people as a consequence of the violence has had an\nimpact in many areas of East Timor. A significant number (perhaps up to 100,000) of refugees\nremain to be repatriated from West Timor.\nD. Screening Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures\n19. Environmental  Problems  Due  to  Project  Location.  These  problems  cannot  be\nassessed at this stage since the exact location of project activities will be determined during\nimplementation. The activities are likely to be in various towns and rural areas across East\nTimor, and will be determined by circumstances like priorities of other donors. However, the\nProject will support only small works comprising the repair and rehabilitation of existing facilities\nthat  were  either  deliberately  damaged  in  the  postconsultation  period  or  are  otherwise\nunserviceable. Only a few new facilities to improve the effectiveness of existing facilities will be\nconstructed. Therefore, no significant environmental impact related to project sites is expected.\n20. Environmental  Problems  Related  to  Design.  Comments  in  paragraph  19  apply.\nDesigns for the rehabilitation and improvement works will have to generally observe preexisting\narrangements and thus there is little latitude for the Project to make significant changes to\naccommodate environmental problems that may be encountered. However, if any problems are\nencountered, they will be mitigated using good environmental practices incorporated in the\nproject design.\n21. Environmental  Problems  Associated  with  Construction  Stage.  The  Project  will\ninvolve  only  minor  construction.  As  such,  transient  environmental  disturbances  normally\nexperienced during construction will be insignificant. Typical environmental disturbances related\nto  WS&S  will  include  minor  excavations  to  replace  pipes  and  fittings  and  repair  drains,\ntemporary road and street closures to allow pipe and drain replacement, minor clearing along\nshort lengths of pipeline routes to allow rehabilitation/construction, clearing of small areas (up to\n20  meters  square  [m2])  for  drill  rig  and  truck  access  to  bore  sites,  and  minor  short-term\nassociated  soil  erosion  if  works  are  undertaken  in  high-rainfall  periods.  Most  of  these\ndisturbances will be temporary and will have an areal impact generally limited to 10-100 m2. As\nmost works will involve the repair or replacement of existing pipelines and other WS&S facilities,\nenvironmental effects will be insignificant. Other possible works are the repair and rehabilitation\nand/or construction of WSS-related structures such as intakes, pump stations, treatment plants,\ngenerator rooms, storage tanks, and boreholes. These works will generally be carried out on\nsites of existing (damaged) structures and no significant environmental effects are foreseen\nother  than  normal,  small-construction  activities  such  as  cartage  of  building  materials  and\nconstruction noise. Again, any effects will be small and temporary, possibly lasting from a few\ndays to a few weeks. Specific measures will be incorporated in contracts for works at or\nadjacent to water intakes to prevent contamination of water supplies.\n22. Environmental Problems Resulting from Project Operations. A potential adverse\noperational  impact  is  increased  local  discharge  of  wastewater  because  of  improved  water\nsupplies. In many instances wastewater discharges will be reduced because of improvement to\nuncontrolled connections and repair of major pipe leaks. Therefore, the Project will emphasize\nthe repair and rehabilitation of drainage systems in problematic areas. Any other potential or\nidentified  adverse  effects  will  be  preempted  or  minimized  by  (i)  improving  water  resource\nmanagement, and (ii) increasing promotion of environmental conservation through community\nparticipation  and  education  activities.  The  capacity  of  existing  final  disposal  sites  will  be\nconsidered for studies related to additional waste disposal sites. The issue of sustainability of\nsystem operation is being addressed through capacity building and institutional development", "70\nAppendix 9, page 6\nactivities under the Project and through cooperation with WSS and donor partners active in the\nWS&S sector.\n23 Potential  Environmental  Enhancement  Measures.  Some  project  activities  will\nsignificantly enhance the environment. In particular, the drainage, solid waste management, and\nseptage collection and treatment will substantially improve the urban environment, particularly in\nDili. The Project will also contribute environmentally sustainable development, in the sector,\nthrough environmental monitoring under the guidance of the PMU.\nE.  Institutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Program\n24. Monitoring  will  comprise  (i)  measuring  the  effectiveness  of  any  environmental\nimprovements needed; (ii) identifying problems that may arise during the construction works;\nand (iii) providing, if necessary, ecological audit information for future works of this nature. The\nproposed monitoring will be designed to quantify the benefits gained and any impacts sustained\nfrom repairing and rehabilitating town and community WS&S systems.\n25. Environmental parameters to be monitored will be defined by the PMU, and will include\nthe qualioty of raw water, treated water, and delivered water; need for and effectiveness of\ndrainage systems; environmental conditions in river and spring catchments, including pollution\nand land clearing, landslide and erosion problems affecting WS&S facilities; efficiency and\neffectiveness of sanitation facilities; and growth of algae in reservoirs.\n26. WSS will be responsible for all water quality testing (chemical and bacteriological). In\ncooperation with local communities, WSS will also be responsible for monitoring construction\nand postconstruction environmental aspects of the project.\n27. Under UNTAET, Indonesian environmental laws remain valid, but their implementation\ncapacity will need to be strengthened. UNTAET is presently reviewing environmental laws,\nregulations, and standards; these may be applied to the Project in the future, although the\nProject is not expected to result in any adverse outcomes.\n28. The PMU and WSS will compile project environmental reports, information from which\nwill be passed on to the relevant sections of UNTAET for consideration when environmental\nstandards and legislation are developed.\n29.  An  environmental  specialist  will  be  recruited  to  assist  the  PMU  in  ensuring  that\nappropriate environmental mitigation measures are included in implementing project activities\nand that the PMU implements appropriate monitoring and reporting.\nF. Findings and Recommendations\n30. The Project will substantially improve the environmental conditions in the project area by\nrehabilitating  and  repairing  the  existing  facilities  and  strengthening  the  capacity  of  the\nresponsible  institution  as  well  as  through  an  improvement  program  that  will  educate  the\ncommunities  to  participate  in  maintaining  good  environmental  conditions,  e.g.,  managing\nhousehold wastes, maintaining the drainage system. Apart from the immediate beneficial impact\nof cleaning up, repairing, and rehabilitating WS&S infrastructure, the project will encourage\n                  \n2 TA 3501-ETM: Environmental Assessment Capacity Improvement, for $250,000, approved on 15 September 2000.", "71\nAppendix 9, page 7\npromotion  of  environmental  health  and  hygiene  education,  ensuring  that  correct  health\nprocedures and water conservation measures are undertaken. The Project will improve the\nmanagement of wastewater, and the solid waste and drainage systems.\n31. Any environmental impacts associated with the Project will be minor and temporary, will\nbe minimized by proper measures, and will be monitored by the PMU. Since the Project is part\nof the overall existing facilities, the result of the monitoring plan will generate a comprehensive\nmonitoring report touching on other investments in water supply and sanitation by other donors.\nG. Conclusions\n32. The  Project  will  not  generate  any  significant  adverse  impact,  but  will  result  in\nenvironmental  improvements.  Therefore,  an  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  is  not\nwarranted. However, is any additional new facilities need to be developed, an environmental\nassessment will be carried out.", "72\nAppendix 10, page 1\nSUMMARY INITIAL SOCIAL ASSESSMENT\nA. Introduction\n1. An  initial  social  assessment  of  the  Project  was  carried  out  as  part  of  the  Asian\nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)\u2019s  Fact-Finding/Appraisal  Mission.  The  report  was  prepared  in\naccordance with ADB's Guidelines for Incorporation of Social Dimensions in Bank Operations.\nB. Benefits and Beneficiaries\n2. In 1998, East Timor had an estimated population of under 0.9 million people, over 50\npercent of whom had been displaced during the postconsultation violence. It is estimated that\nupward of 85 percent have returned to their homes since the end of 1999. About 80-90 percent\nof the population live in rural areas, with the remainder living in the capital Dili and in 12 main\ntowns. The towns have formal urban dwellers, and an estimated 50 percent squatters and peri-\nurban populations.\n3. Even before the 1999 destruction and displacement, East Timor was one of the poorest\nareas in southeast Asia, with severe problems of adult literacy (64 percent), life expectancy (55-\n58 years), and infant mortality moderately high at 85 deaths per 1,000 live births, only 25 percent\nof villages had a health clinic, and health indicators demonstrated that East Timor was one of the\nunhealthiest provinces within Indonesia.1 The fall in the value of the rupiah against the dollar as\na result of the Asian financial crisis reduced real gross domestic product to only $246 in 1997.\nThe incidence of poverty fell from 37 percent in 1993 to around 25 percent in 1997,and then\nclimbed back to 37 percent due to the financial crisis and political upheaval. This has increased\nto 75 percent in 1999-2000 as a result of the political, economic, and social upheaval from\nAugust 1999 to September 2000 (footnote 1). In the rural sector, the destruction of people's\nmeans of agricultural production, the closure of banks, and loss of meager savings resulted in\nEast Timor being considered one of the absolutely poorest countries in the world.\n4. Under most Timorese traditional systems, the role of women was severely restricted, with\nmen dominating in decision making and leadership roles within the villages. These roles are\nchanging as a result of the social disruption caused by the country's long-term struggle for\nindependence,  with  women  participating  fully  in  the  clandestine  front  and  in  the  armed\nresistance. Women are gaining new skills and responsibilities, and are beginning to move into\ntraditionally male-dominated income-generating activities. It is imperative that this respect and\nnewly acquired roles are maintained within the new East Timorese society.\nC. Needs, Demands, and Absorptive Capacity\n5. Prior to the upheaval it is estimated that less than half the population had access to safe\nwater (48 percent) and sanitation (38 percent) facilities. Sanitation practices, which were often\nunhygienic, were constrained by the absence of sufficient water. Dry pit latrines were used\nextensively and were often located adjacent to water courses, or households. Major health\nhazards were due to lack of sanitation facilities in poorer rural and urban areas. Poor households\nwere further disadvantaged, with poor access to basic health and education services.\n                  \n1 Initial Poverty Assessment East Timor, Asian Development Bank in collaboration with the East Timor Transitional\nAdministration, September 2000.", "73\nAppendix 10, page 2\n6. With  the  substantial  damage  to  infrastructure  and  public  utilities  following  the\npostconsultation violence, already degraded services ceased to function. Most communities had\naccess to water through traditional means or through some emergency reconstruction works.\nThe situation worsened with the onset of the dry season. Emergency programs funded by\nvarious donors and nongovernment organizations (NGOs) had generally restored basic water\nsupply services in Dili and in district capitals by the start of the Water Supply and Sanitation\nRehabilitation Program, Phase I (WSSRP-1).\n7. In this environment, the immediate tasks of WSSRP-1 and the proposed Project will be to\nensure the establishment of a comprehensive and equitable water supply and sanitation (WS&S)\nprogram that will eventually provide adequate supplies and an appropriate level of service for all\npeople in East Timor. It is important to implement this program within the constraints imposed by\nthe community's commitments to other programs, restricted financial and institutional capacity,\nand other competing community and household objectives.\n8. In all areas, the rehabilitation and development of water supplies will free labor (both men\nand women) for more productive uses. Improved sanitation facilities and practices, and the\nprovision of clean water will have beneficial health effects, particularly on children and infants,\nand reduce the costs associated with disease and morbidity.\nD. Adverse Effects on Vulnerable Groups\n9. The Project will not involve any significant land acquisition. Small areas of land may be\nrequired for facilities such as intakes or borehole sites. In such situations, rights of access and\nuse will be negotiated for a period of, say, 50 years, with compensation to include damage to\ncrops. No resettlement is required under the Project. Project works will use the existing rights-of-\nway wherever possible. The Project will not have negative impacts on any vulnerable group.\nE. Social Dimensions in Project Design\n1. Community Participation\n10. The  remoteness  of  many  of  the  communities  and  the  difficulty  of  access  to  the\nsettlements made it almost impossible in the past for any effective services to be provided at the\ncommunity level. It was observed, and recounted in discussions, that community participation\nhad been lacking in the process of developing appropriate water supply systems and sanitation\nfacilities. In a number of villages, where infrastructure such as WS&S existed, the residents did\nnot know which agency the facilities came from. This resulted in lack of a sense of ownership\nand lack of a motivation for the community to manage, operate, or maintain the facilities and\nsystems. When technical problems arose, the community took no action, and reverted to the\nprevious methods of attaining water or disposing of faeces. This situation is prevalent in the\nmajority of communities visited during the mission.\n11. The communities have a very limited capacity to operate and maintain any facilities,\nprimarily due to lack of funds, and also poor training, lack of technical support, and lack of simple\nmanuals, tools, and repair equipment. The use of inappropriate technology in the past made\nmany systems difficult to maintain due to the difficulty of obtaining spare parts and the shortage\nof qualified and experienced technical staff to undertake the repairs. Some systems were also\nvery expensive to operate and maintain due to the need for constant repair and replacement of\nparts that were of inferior quality or where poor workmanship and quality of design and/or\nconstruction had resulted in frequent breakage or failure. It is therefore especially important for", "74\nAppendix 10, page 3\ncommunities to be able to plan, manage, and implement their own development. Systems in\ncommunities that operate and maintain their own facilities are more likely to sustainable than\nsystems that rely on government operation and maintenance (O&M).\n12. The success of any development project involved in the WS&S sector depends on the\neffective  participatory  involvement  of  the  community,  especially  at  the  earliest  stages  of\ncommunity project activities. The use of a methodology such as participatory rural appraisal\n(PRA) is effective in social preparation, problem solving, awareness raising, informing choice\nand facilitating participation of the community at all stages. An important lesson of WSSRP-1 is\nthe value of NGOs in facilitating participatory development. Their closeness to the community\nhelps in participatory planning and community mobilization, which creates a sense of ownership\nand therefore extends sustainability. Changes in knowledge, attitudes, and practices relating to\nwater use, hygiene, and sanitation are essential to achieve improvements in community health\nand well-being. Community participation and social preparation are critical in promoting hygiene\nand sanitation. The installation of facilities such as water supply systems and latrines does not in\nitself guarantee improved health of the people. The focus must be extended to the proper\nutilization and management of WS&S.\n13. While the process of community participation within the WS&S sector is an ideal way to\nproceed, in East Timor the current situation is more complicated. A Trust Fund for East Timor\n(TFET) World Bank Community Empowerment and Local Governance Project (CEP)1 is already\nunder way. Community WS&S activities are being implemented by NGOs including some under\nWSSRP-1. It is important to recognize that these programs may result in an inordinate time and\nresource burden on recipient community members who are still struggling to rebuild their own\npersonal lives. It is important that WS&S programs do not exceed this capacity threshold.\n14. Therefore, all WS&S program components, while still utilizing a community participatory\nand ownership approach wherever possible, should take account of other community initiatives\nand a community\u2019s capacity to engage in such activities.\n2. Gender\n15. The role of women in most Timorese traditional systems,was severely restricted. But the\nsituation has changed (para. 4). Women have gained new skills and responsibilities, and are\nbeginning to move into traditionally male-dominated income-generating activities. It is imperative\nthat these newly acquired status and roles are maintained within the new East Timorese society.\n16. Women are major contributors to household income by marketing agricultural produce\nand engaging in petty trading activities. Women report they have a say in decisions about\nhousehold spending and have access to savings to spend as needed.\n17. Although women reported fairly evenly divided responsibilities for water fetching, it was\ngenerally acknowledged that they bore the most burden and responsibility, as men were often\nworking elsewhere. Most rural women reported times in excess of 1 hour a day for water\ncarrying. Water was often not treated, due to lack of knowledge, time, or resources. In addition,\nwomen are the primary caregivers and are responsible for household work. They look after the\nhealth of family members and care for sick family members, further reducing time and energy for\nboth  productive  and  personal  activities.  It  is  therefore  women  who  are  in  most  need  of\n                  \n1 The CEP is a World Bank/ADB-managed, TFET-funded project that began in March 2000.", "75\nAppendix 10, page 4\nassistance in reducing the time and effort required to obtain water supplies and to care for family\nmembers.\n18. Female survey respondents reported frequent skin and genital inflammations, indicative\nof poor water quality and sanitation practices. Lack of water for washing was a recurrent theme.\nImplementation of community WS&S programs integrated with hygiene promotion activities will\nhelp improve the situation. It will give women more time to pursue other opportunities, and\nprovide  a  healthy  environment  for  themselves  and  their  families.  Any  WS&S  program  is\nexpected  to  work  in  conjunction  with  other  initiatives  in  community  development  and\nempowerment.\n19. Improving  hygiene  and  sanitation,  and  the  use  of  WS&S  facilities  by  improving\nknowledge, attitudes, and practices of the whole community will positively impact on women.\nThe  health  of  the  family  will  improve,  and  the  load  borne  by  women  as  caretakers  will\ncorrespondingly reduce. Due to their traditional roles in the sector, women have a particular\nneed for improved access to and effective management and use of WS&S facilities.\n3. Sustainability\n20. At this early stage of reconstruction and development, it is difficult to say how the WS&S\nsector, can be sustainable. There will certainly be a need for aid and support for many years to\ncome. The strength and perseverance of the East Timorese throughout and following the conflict\nare amazing and will provide a sound foundation for their nation.\na. Community Ownership\n21. Within the WS&S sector, sustainability will be different between the urban (public) and\nthe rural (community) systems. However, a common element in achieving sustainability will be a\nstrong level of ownership of project activities by the target groups, whether through community\nmanagement in the rural areas or cost recovery in the urban areas. Issues of sustainability can\nbe addressed through adequate involvement of target groups and participants early on in project\nactivities.\nb. Health and Hygiene Awareness\n22. Another common element for sustainability is health and hygiene awareness in water use\nand sanitation. It is essential that the community gain an understanding of the link between\nwater, and sanitation and health conditions of the community. The recognized importance of\ndomestic and personal hygiene, proper water use, and appropriate sanitation will encourage\ncommunities to change their habits. These changes will ensure that the people will sustain the\ndevelopments implemented within the Project, such as improved WS&S and water management\ngroups. An understanding of the importance of the changes to the health of the community will\nensure sustainability.\nc. Institutions\n23. WSS was established as a national WS&S organization with broad responsibilities for\nservice  delivery  in  the  sector.  It  is  expected  to  continue  and  develop  under  the  future\nindependent East Timorese Government. WSS must consider the sustainability of the institutions\nwithin the sector. Issues to consider include cost recovery, corporatization, and human resource", "76\nAppendix 10, page 5\ncapability. These issues are being dealt with under WSSRP-1 and the Project will provide further\ncapacity-building support.\nd. Cost Recovery\n24. In the urban WS&S systems there will eventually be the need for recovery of operation\nand maintenance costs if systems are to be sustained. In the urban areas, particularly in Dili,\nthere  is  a  decided  lack  of  community  management  in  an  everyday  utility  like  water  and\nsanitation, that is, it is taken for granted. Given this, it is essential that recipients be made aware\nof the price implications of the substantial investments and the operating costs involved. Aside\nfrom sustaining management and operations, tariffs also encourage users to utilize a resource\nmore effectively, further increasing the sustainability of the water resource itself.\ne. Willingness and Ability to Pay\n25. An essential component of cost recovery is the community\u2019s willingness and ability to pay\nor to participate in management. Without regard for these two issues, sustainability through cost\nrecovery  cannot  be  achieved.  During  project  implementation,  assessing  affordability  and\nwillingness to pay through a survey is suggested as basis for the progressive introduction of cost\nrecovery objectives. As the economy progresses, the situation will change (in varying degrees)\nand WSS will need to monitor these changes to ensure the threshold is not breached.\nf. Appropriate Technology\n26. The importance of appropriate technology in sustainability cannot be overemphasized.\nProblems have been encountered with O&M in some of the emergency systems implemented by\nthe  United  Nations  Transitional  Administration  in  East  Timor  (UNTAET)  and  NGOs.  By\nincorporating technology that is within the financial capabilities and technical capacities of the\ncommunity to manage, the extent to which the system will be sustainable will increase. Problems\nrelating to the lack of spare parts and repairs are also key concerns in the transfer of technology\nto  rural  communities.  Within  any  program,  provision  must  be  included  to  train  community\nmembers in the O&M of the facilities installed. In deciding appropriate technology mechanisms,\nthe  accessibility  of  spare  parts  must  be  considered.  In  relation  to  O&M,  encouraging  the\ncommunity to establish financial capabilities to sustain ongoing maintenance and repairs must\nalso be considered. Appropriate technology also means use of the most cost-effective technical\nsolutions.\n4. Urban and Rural Groups\n27. Following the destruction, there has been a fear that rural groups will relocate to urban\nareas. There is no conclusive evidence to support this now. Conversely, with the cessation of\nIndonesian rule (and their relocation policies), both urban and rural populations are grappling\nwith land title and occupation issues that impact on their ability to recover from the crisis. In\nsome cases, original landowners are reportedly asking families to relocate to their traditional\nhomelands, or to seek opportunities in urban areas. Additionally, town and district borders are\nbeing redrawn, families are still returning, and there are sporadic militia activities within border\ndistricts.  Overall,  there  is  a  sense  of  change  that  is  still  affecting  people\u2019s  decisions  and\npractices, and will do so until some normality returns.\n28. It is therefore important that all programs for urban and rural areas be seen as equitable.\nUrban works will eventually need to show cost recovery because of the greater investment", "77\nAppendix 10, page 6\nrequired. This cost should not be borne, even indirectly, by the rural population. Community\nwater  supplies  may  never  be  wholly  economical;  however,  their  small  investment  costs,\ncombined with linkage to other community development objectives (such as self management,\nempowerment, and community autonomy), may obviate the need for cost recovery. Additionally,\nwith the relocation of some families into urban areas, and the development of improved water\nand  sanitation  facilities  in  all  communities,  it  is  imperative  that  households'  knowledge  of\nappropriate water and hygienic practices be strengthened, so as to avert wastage and misuse,\nand maximize health benefits.\n5. Nongovernment Organizations\n29. Over 150 international and local NGOs currently operate in East Timor. With their greater\nfinances and support, the international NGOs, while doing great work and often working closely\nwith local NGOs, are overshadowing the local organizations. On many occasions, local groups\nstated that they wanted to have more involvement and autonomy within the sector. Indeed, a\nmore dynamic and larger group of local NGOs would be an asset to the sector, and the WS&S\nprogram  should  facilitate  local  NGOs'  establishment,  coordination,  development,  and\nparticipation in the sector.\n30. Implementation of WSSRP-1 used international and local NGOs to provide a range of\nservices. Further engagement of NGOs is proposed for the Project. The development of local\nNGOs and community-based organizations is significantly encouraged by a range of donor\nprograms.  The  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development  (AusAID)  in  particular  is\nproviding capacity-building support to local NGOs for WS&S activities through the NGO forum.\nThe intention is to build the local capacity of the East Timor NGOs to facilitate the sustainability\nof community WS&S work within the country.\n6. Health\n31. Poor health conditions related to WS&S and hygiene practices exist widely throughout\nEast Timor. While poor health in itself is a problem, high rates of morbidity adversely impact on\npoor  communities.  The  increased  burden  of  caring  for  sick  family  members,  as  well  as  a\nconsequent  reduction  in  productive  activities,  exacerbates  the  already  poor  socioeconomic\nstatus of the community.\n7. Minority Groups\n32. East  Timor  has  no  identified  minority  groups.  Rural  communities  are  the  main\nbeneficiaries of the water and sanitation works, especially those in the border districts that\nsuffered and continue to suffer the most interruption to normal activity. The Project aims to\nensure equity across districts, between genders, and between urban and rural communities.\n8. Resettlement and Land Acquisition\n33. The Project is not expected to require any resettlement based on existing service levels.\nWithin urban communities, there may be some land tenure and land acquisition issues that may\nrequire careful attention. Mechanisms for dealing with land access issues were established\nduring  WSSRP-1  and  will  be  used  for  the  Project  if  required.  Where  public  land  was  not\navailable, rights of access and use for a period of (say) 50 years were negotiated with land\nowners.", "78\nAppendix 10, page 7\n9. Stakeholder Participation\n34. The Project framework was developed using a rapid consultative approach consulting\nwith key stakeholders particularly within the UNTAET administration. The Project design is\nflexible, and it will be necessary to undertake further consultation with diverse stakeholders to\nfurther refine the detailed activities to be implemented. A process of community participation will\nbe part of the detailed planning and implementation of various project activities, managed either\nthrough  the  project  management  unit  or  through  the  participating  NGOs.  As  part  of  the\npreparation for WSSRP-1, many men and women, and various community and political groups\nat national, district, and community levels were consulted. Communities and both formal and\ninformal women\u2019s groups were consulted extensively throughout the field visits.\n35. It is essential that communities, local NGOs, and women\u2019s groups be involved in project\ndesign,  implementation,  and  O&M  of  the  program  components.  There  will  be  a  significant\ncommunity focus in all the water and sanitation implementation components."], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20010911171435Z", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 3.01 for Windows", "Author": "rsa", "Creator": "ADOBEPS4.DRV Version 4.10", "Title": "Microsoft Word - R107-01ETM.doc", "ModDate": "D:20040402082505+08'00'"}}
