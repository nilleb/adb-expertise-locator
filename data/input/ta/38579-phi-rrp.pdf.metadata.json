The loan \nwill be accompanied by a technical assistance (TA) grant of $500,000.  \n   \nRationale  The reduction of poverty is of the highest priority for the Government of \nthe Philippines. Poverty rates have declined in the Philippines in the \npast two decades, however, the absolute number of poor people has \nincreased to over 26 million. The second Quarter 2005 Social Weather \nSurvey reported that economic conditions for the people continue to be \nharsh, as 57% of household heads regard their households as poor, \nand 12% report that their households experienced hunger at least \nonce in the last three months. \n \nAccess to microfinance services can improve household incomes and \nreduce poverty and vulnerability of the poor. Access to microfinance \nservices can help the poor build viable businesses and pursue income-\ngenerating activities. Microfinance is the central strategy for poverty \nreduction in the Philippines under Republic Act 8425 (Social Reform \nand Poverty Alleviation Act) and is an important part of the Medium- \nTerm Philippine Development Plan (MTDP) 2004-2010 and the current \nadministration\u2019s  10-point  agenda.  Although  the  Philippines  has \nachieved good progress in promoting microfinance, more than two-\nthirds of poor households, or 17 million people, still do not have access \nto microfinance services. Critical actions must now be taken to develop \na  sound  foundation  to  develop  microfinance  further  at  a  much \nsubstantially  accelerated  pace  in  order  to  achieve  the  national \noutreach and necessary sustainability. \n   \nObjectives and  MDP  will  support  the  Government  to  address  the  systemic \nScope  weaknesses in the sector and achieve the Millennium Development \n  Goals including eradication of extreme poverty and hunger, and the \npromotion of gender equality and empowerment of women. It aims to \npromote  permanent  access  to  sustainable,  competitively-priced \nfinancial services for the poor and their microenterprises. It is aligned \nwith the G-8 Action Plan for poverty reduction, best practices of the \nConsultative  Group  to  Assist  the  Poor  (CGAP),  and  Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB) Microfinance Development Strategy.  \n \nThe overall objective of the MDP is to improve household incomes, \nreduce poverty, and reduce vulnerability of the poor. To achieve this \nobjective, the MDP will undertake strategic reforms to: \n \n(i)  enhance  the  enabling  policy  and  regulatory  environment  and \nremove regulatory impediments and policy distortions to promote \nmarket  efficiencies  and  increased  outreach  of  services  at \ncompetitive prices to the poor; \n \n \n ", "ii   \n(ii) build  viable  microfinance  institutions  (MFIs)  that  can  provide \nefficient and cost-effective retail delivery of services to the poor; \n(iii) strengthen regulatory and supervisory capacities and oversight for \na sound microfinance sector; and  \n(iv) increase financial literacy and consumer protection for the poor \nand users of microfinance services. \n   \nClassification  Targeting Classification: Targeted Intervention \nSector: Finance \nSub-sector: Microfinance \nThemes: Sustainable economic growth; inclusive social \n    development; gender and development \nSubthemes: Promoting economic efficiency and enabling markets; \n    gender equity in empowerment and rights \n   \nEnvironmental  Category C \nAssessment   \n   \nSocial Sector  Category C: Involuntary resettlement \nAssessment  Category B: Impact on indigenous peoples \n   \nLoan Amount and  It is proposed that ADB support the Government\u2019s policy reforms by \nTerms  providing a loan of $150 million. The Borrower will be the Republic of \nthe Philippines. The loan will be from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources \nwith a 15-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, an interest \nrate determined in accordance with ADB's London interbank offered \nrate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  and  a  commitment  charge  of \n0.75% per annum, and such other terms and conditions as are set \nforth in the Loan Agreement. The loan proceeds are expected to be \nutilized over a period of 24 months from the date of loan effectiveness. \n   \nProgram Monitoring  The program period will be 24 months. The loan will be released in two \nand Tranching  tranches. The first tranche of $75 million will be made available upon \nthe  Government  meeting  conditions  of  loan  effectiveness  including \nsatisfactory  compliance  with  first  tranche  conditions.  The  second \ntranche of $75 million, which is expected to be released within 24 \nmonths  of  loan  effectiveness,  will  be  released  upon  satisfactory \ncompliance with agreed-upon conditions.    \n   \nExecuting Agency  The Department of Finance (DOF) will be the Executing Agency for the \nand Implementation  MDP and provide overall guidance for project implementation. The \nArrangements  implementing agencies will include Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), \nBureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), Cooperative Development Authority \n(CDA), National Anti-Poverty Commission (NAPC), Philippine Postal \nSavings Bank (PPSB), and the Securities and Exchange Commission \n(SEC). NAPC is the mandated oversight body under the Social Reform \nand  Poverty  Alleviation  Act  (RA 8425)  for  the  development  and \nstrengthening of the microfinance industry. The National Credit Council \n(NCC) Secretariat has been nominated by the Secretary of Finance to \nbe the program management unit (PMU) to oversee implementation of \nthe  program  and  to  coordinate  activities  among  the  participating \nagencies.  The  NCC  inter-agency  committees  chaired  by  DOF, \nincluding  representatives  from  the  National  Economic  and \n ", "  iii\nDevelopment Authority (NEDA), and other participating agencies, will \nprovide ongoing forums to facilitate sector reforms.  \n   \nProcurement and  The loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange \nDisbursement  costs  (excluding  local  duties  and  taxes)  of  items  produced  and \nprocured  in  ADB  member  countries,  excluding  ineligible  items  and \nimports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources.  In \naccordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of \nDisbursement  Procedures  and  Related  Requirements  for  Program \nLoans, a reimbursement procedure will be used to disburse the loan \nproceeds based on certification to be provided by the Borrower.  No \nsupporting import documentation will be required, if during each year \nthat loan proceeds are expected to be disbursed, the value of the \nRepublic  of  the  Philippines\u2019  total  imports  minus  imports  from \nnonmember countries, ineligible imports, and imports financed under \nother official development assistance is equal to or greater than the \namount of the loan expected to be disbursed during such year. The \nGovernment  will  certify  its  compliance  with  this  formula  with  each \nwithdrawal request. Otherwise, import documentation under existing \nprocedures will be required. ADB reserves the right to audit the use of \nloan  proceeds  and  verify  the  accuracy  of  the  Government\u2019s \ncertification. \n   \nCounterpart Funds  The counterpart funds to be generated out of the loan proceeds will be \nused  to  finance  the  associated  structural  adjustment  costs  and \nactivities  consistent  with  the  MDP  and  the  development  of  a \nsustainable  and  diverse,  market-oriented  microfinance  sector  with \nexpanded outreach of a wider range of services at competitive prices \nto the poor. \n   \nRisks and  Implementation  of  the  Program  could  be  affected  by  a  number  of \nAssumptions  factors. The principal risk stems from resistance by vested interests to \nreforms,  including  measures  for  increased  transparency,  disclosure \nand  competition.  Such  resistance  can  be  overcome  through  the \nGovernment\u2019s  continued  commitment  to  poverty  reduction  and  the \ndevelopment of microfinance and microenterprises as embodied in the \nSocial Reform and Poverty Alleviation Act and the MTDP 2004-2010. \nThere  may  also  be  delays  because  of  political  instability  or  social \nunrest, and lack of capacity to implement reforms in a timely manner.  \n   \nBenefits and  The MDP will provide significant benefits and will have positive impacts \nBeneficiaries  on the poor. These include the following: \n \n(i)  a  deeper  financial  sector  that  fosters  broad-based,  economic \ngrowth,  reduces  poverty  and  contributes  to  macroeconomic \nstability;  \n(ii)  development  of  a  sustainable  and  diverse,  market-oriented \nmicrofinance sector with greater outreach to the poor;  \n(iii)  a  strengthened  regulatory  and  supervisory  framework  that \npromotes  governance,  transparency  and  disclosure,  and \nincreased competition and soundness of MFIs; \n(iv)  lower cost of services to the poor and increased access to a wider \nrange of services in rural and remote areas, including savings and \n ", "iv   \nremittance services; \n(v)  expansion of low-cost cell phone-based technology in the sector \nto facilitate remittance flows to MFIs and payments including in \nremote areas; \n(vi)  mobilization  of  savings  in  MFIs\u2019  deposit  accounts  providing  a \nlower-cost source of funds for MFIs, in turn lowering cost of credit \nto the poor;  \n(vii)  improved  efficiency,  sustainability,  and  performance  of  service \nproviders  through  national  training,  adoption  of  uniform \nperformance standards and standard chart of accounts; \n(viii)  increased financial literacy to empower the poor, and consumer \nprotection for users of microfinance services, including a viable \nsystem for the poor to make inquiries or file complaints in rural \nareas; and \n(ix)  reduced vulnerability of the poor to illegal and unsound practices \nas new products and services are introduced in an expanding \nmarket. \n   \nTechnical  The objective of the TA is to (i) promote financial literacy and help the \nAssistance   Government develop a national financial literacy program for the poor \nand  users of  microfinance  services;  (ii)  build  viable  MFIs  that  can \nprovide efficient and cost effective retail delivery of services to the poor \nand  (iii)  establish  a  consumer  protection  framework  to  reduce \nvulnerability of the poor to illegal and unsound practices. The TA is \nestimated  to  cost  $715,000  equivalent.  ADB  will  provide  $500,000 \nequivalent, to be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund \n(JSF), funded by the Government of Japan, and the Government will \ncontribute $215,000 equivalent.   \n \nIn parallel with the preparation of the MDP, an associated project is \nbeing  developed,  Developing  Financial  Cooperatives,  for  possible \nfinancing  by  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  (JFPR)  in  the \namount of $900,000, subject to the approval of the Government of \nJapan. This project is designed to develop monitoring and regulatory \ncapacities of CDA, and provide capacity building of the savings and \ncredit  cooperatives  sector  over  2005\u20132008  for  efficient  and  sound \noperations and financial services to the poor.  \n \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of the Philippines for the Microfinance Development Program (MDP). The report \nalso describes technical assistance (TA) to support the implementation of MDP, and if the Board \napproves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, shall \napprove the TA. \n \nII.  THE SECTOR \n \nA.  Sector Description and Performance  \n   \n2.  The Macroeconomic Context. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) Philippine country \npoverty analysis (CPA) for 2005 shows that the Philippines shares the common problem of low-\nincome countries \u2212 high poverty, despite its middle-income status. The overall poverty incident \nwas still high at 44.1% in 20031, though it had declined from 53.5% in 1991. The distribution of \nincome is highly inequitable. The lowest income quintile accounted for only 4.7% of total income \nin 2003, which was unchanged from 1991. Meanwhile, the highest income quintile accounted for \n53.4% of total income in 2003, compared to 53.9% in 1991. The Gini coefficient2 during the \nsame period was unchanged at 0.47, with a narrow fluctuation between 0.45 in 1994 and 0.49 in \n1997. Though the Philippines experienced sustained GDP growth from 2000\u20132003, preliminary \n2003 Family Income and Expenditure Survey results indicate a 10% drop in real average family \nincomes. Families in the National Capital Region (NCR) suffered an almost 20% drop. The \nsustained economic growth during this period had not been pro-poor. The very high rural \npoverty incidence (47% of families in 2000) has remained unchanged since 1988 (46.3% of \nfamilies). The urban poverty incidence fell from 30.1% of families in 1988 to 19.9% in 2000. \nHowever, the absolute number of urban poor families grew by 11% nationwide between 1997 \nand 2000. There are seven regions where the number of urban poor families grew by more than \n20%. Rural poverty incidence is much more pronounced than urban poverty incidence, but the \nnumber of urban poor families is increasing. \n \n3.  The  second  quarter  2005  Social  Weather  Stations  survey3  reported  that  economic \nconditions continue to be harsh; 57% of household heads regarded their households as poor, \nand 12% reported that their households experienced hunger at least once in the last 3 months. \nIn  the  Medium-Term  Philippine  Development  Plan  (MTDP)  2004\u20132010,  the  Government \nreported that poverty incidence worsened to 34% in 2000 from 33% in 1997 and the number of \npoor  individuals  increased  from  23.95  million  in  1997  to  26.54  million  in  2000.  With  the \npopulation growing at 2.36% per year and a projected annual addition of 1.6 million people, a \nheavy burden will be placed on the social and physical infrastructure and the environment. \nWithout  corrective  action  to  rebalance  population  growth  against  the  limited  resources, \nprospects are limited for moving the 40% of Filipinos currently living on $2 or less a day out of \npoverty. Even with no change in the population, \u201caccess poverty\u201d is a major problem. Poverty is \nmanifested in low incomes and in exclusion, including poor access to services. Income poverty \nin the Philippines is a dynamic phenomenon with people moving in and out of poverty over time. \nA survey to gauge chronic and transient poverty found that over a 3-year period about one fifth \n                                                 \n1  Schelzig, Karin. 2005. Poverty in the Philippines: Income, Assets, and Access. Manila: ADB. Poverty incident \ndefined as proportion of the population living on less than $2 per day. \n2  The Gini coefficient is a measure of inequality developed by the Italian statistician Corrado Gini and published in \n1912. It is usually used to measure income inequality, but can be used to measure any form of uneven distribution. \n3  Social Weather Stations (SWS), established in 1985 as a private non-stock, nonprofit social research institution, \nprovides survey-based social monitoring in the Philippines.  \n ", "2   \nof the surveyed households were chronically poor, whereas almost one third of the households \nmoved in and out of poverty over the period.4 \n \n4.  Poverty Reduction and Microfinance. The CPA highlights seven major causes of \npoverty: (i) weak macroeconomic management; (ii) employment issues; (iii) high population \ngrowth rates; (iv) an underperforming agricultural sector and an unfinished land reform agenda; \n(v) governance issues including corruption and a weak state; (vi) conflict and security issues, \nparticularly  in  Mindanao;  and  (vii) disability.  The  CPA  also  recognizes  that  poverty  is \nmultidimensional, and defines poverty as deprivation of five essential assets, or types of capital: \n \n(i)  human capital (education, good health, skills, and ability to work);  \n(ii)  natural capital (natural resource stocks such as land, forested areas, and clean \nair); \n(iii)  physical  capital  (basic  infrastructure  and  services  such  as  shelter,  transport, \nwater and sanitation, energy, and communications); \n(iv)  financial capital (earned income, savings, remittances, access to credit); and \n(v)  social capital (social resources such as network of family, friends, and social and \ncommunity organizations). \n \n5.  Access to credit is a form of financial capital. Microfinance credit and services that help \nthe poor to receive remittances and build savings safely can also help them gain access to other \nfundamental assets such as education, good health, shelter, and communications. Studies from \na number of countries have shown that the rural poor\u2019s lack of access to product and factor \nmarkets leaves them largely bypassed by the growth process. Making markets work for the poor \nis therefore a key element of a country\u2019s poverty reduction strategy.5 This supports the view that \nthe poor should be actively engaged in the growth process, as opposed to being left simply to \nshare in the benefits of growth (i.e., relying on the trickle-down effects of growth). Microfinance \ncan help the poor gain access to product and factor markets, and increase employment and \nincome-generating activities, thereby actively engaging them in the growth process.  \n \n6.  Supply and Demand of Microfinance Services. Various microfinance services are \nprovided in the Philippines by banks, cooperatives, and nongovernment organizations (NGOs), \nincluding 184 banks6 (rural, thrift and cooperative banks), about 500 NGOs, and 4,579 savings \nand credit cooperatives. Many other types of registered cooperatives also provide some form of \nfinancial services. In addition, an increasing number of financial institutions are engaging in \nmicrofinance, while informal and unregulated institutions are moving toward formalization. MFI \nNGOs have played an important role in providing services in hard-to-reach areas where the \nprivate sector has not entered and where there is less information on the markets and potential \nclients. The number of active borrowers from banks engaged in microfinance was reported by \nBSP at 549,348 as of December 2004. NAPC reports show total borrowers at 2.1 million, \nincluding bank clients, as of June 2005 based on information reported by government financial \ninstitutions (GFIs) engaged in wholesale lending to microfinance institutions.  \n \n7.  Although the Philippines has achieved significant progress in promoting microfinance, \nmore than two-thirds of poor households, or 17 million people, still do not have access to \nmicrofinance services.7 Instead, the poor rely heavily on self-finance or informal sources that \n                                                 \n4  Footnote 1. \n5  Yao, Xianbin. 2003. Infrastructure and Poverty Reduction \u2013 Making Markets Work for the Poor. Manila: ADB.  \n6  BSP data as of 31 December 2004. \n7  Source: NAPC. Based on average household size of six persons, and 4.3 million poor households. \n ", "  3\nmay  be  very  costly,  limiting  their  ability  to  participate  in  and  benefit  from  development \nopportunities and income-generating activities. The limited outreach of microfinance services is \nreported in the National Anti-Poverty Commission (NAPC) 2004 report, Status of Microfinance \nOutreach  in  60  Poorest  Provinces,  which  details  outreach,  potential  number  of  client \nhouseholds,  and  saturation  level  of  microfinance  services  in  each  area  (Supplementary \nAppendix A). Access to microfinance services can help the poor build viable businesses, pursue \neconomic opportunities and income-generating activities, and reduce vulnerability to external \nshocks  or  contingencies.  Microfinance  is  the  central  strategy  for  poverty  reduction  in  the \nPhilippines under Republic Act 8425 Social Reform and Poverty Alleviation Act, and is an \nimportant  part  of  the  MTDP  2004-2010.  However,  despite  Government  commitment  and \ndevelopment of the sector to date, further measures are required to meet popular demand, \nachieve  Government\u2019s  goal  of  universal  access  originally  targeted  for  2005,  and  address \nsystemic weaknesses in the sector.  \n \n8.   Microfinance  encompasses  a  range  of  services  including  savings  deposits,  loans, \npayment services, money transfers, remittances, and insurance. Historically, microfinance has \nconcentrated on microcredit designed for high-turnover microenterprises. In practice, however, it \nhas been found that clients have adapted the loans for a variety of purposes such as medical \nexpenses, funerals, and school fees in addition to funding livelihood activities. Microfinance is \nalso  important  for  land  acquisition,  housing  construction,  purchase  of  animals,  consumer \ndurables  and  other  items.  Bangko  Sentral  ng  Pilipinas  (BSP)  regulations8  specify  that  the \nmaximum principal amount of a microfinance loan shall not exceed P150,000 and, loans are \noften P4,000 and below. Interest rates in the market are high, and it is not uncommon to see \nrates of 60% or more per annum even before additional fees and deductions are taken into \naccount.  These  high  rates  of  interest  could  be  reduced  through  competitive  pricing  and \nincreased  efficiencies  to  lower  cost  of  borrowing  to  the  poor.  The  clients  of  microfinance \ninstitutions (MFIs) are broadly the poor and low-income households and their microenterprises.9  \nMore than 90% of borrowers to date have been women. Who controls the funds once received, \nand how these are managed within the household unit, are areas for further examination. MFI \nclients  typically  lack  assets  for  collateral,  and  are  self-employed  in  the  informal  sector  or \nengaged in economic livelihood activities. Loans are based on the borrower household's net \ncash  flow  and  non-traditional  forms  of  security,  and  may  be  provided  to  either  groups  or \nindividuals.10  The microfinance sector as a whole has had very good repayment rates, and this \nis one of the attractive features of this market for financial institutions. The demand for savings \nservices is strong as or stronger than the demand for credit, and an expansion of the outreach \nof savings services will be essential for institutional sustainability and poverty reduction.  \n \nB.  Issues and Opportunities \n \n  1.   Policy, Legal, and Regulatory Frameworks  \n \n9.  The Philippines National Strategy for Microfinance was prepared by the National Credit \nCouncil  (NCC),  an  inter-agency  body  chaired  by  the  Department  of  Finance  (DOF).  The \n                                                 \n8  BSP Circular 272, Guidelines Implementing the Provisions of Sections 40, 43 and 44 of the General Banking Act \n2000. Issued January 2001. \n9  A microenterprise as defined under BSP Circular No. 376 issued March 2003 is any business activity or enterprise \nwhose total assets, inclusive of those arising from loans but exclusive of the land on which the business entity\u2019s \noffice, plant and equipment are situated , has a value less than P3,000,000. In 2001, microenterprises accounted \nfor 91.7% of the total number of registered business firms in the Philippines and 38% of total employment.  \n10 Microfinance lending methodologies include the Grameen Bank Approach (group lending) and Association of \nSocial Advancement (ASA) Methodology (individual lending).  \n ", "4   \nregulatory framework for MFIs also formulated by NCC covers deposit-taking institutions that \nare  subject  to  prudential  regulation  and  supervision.  Under  existing  laws,  only  banks  and \ncooperatives are legally authorized to accept deposits. Banks can accept deposits from the \ngeneral public, and cooperatives can accept deposits from their members. The objective of the \nframework  is  to  provide  access  to  financial  services  in  a  liberalized  and  market-oriented \neconomy where the private sector plays a major role and the government provides the enabling \npolicy environment for efficient markets. The core principles of the strategy are: \n  \n(i)  a greater role for the private sector in the provision of financial services to the \npoor; \n(ii)  an enabling policy environment that will facilitate increased participation by the \nprivate sector; \n(iii)  adoption of market-oriented financial and credit policies (e.g. market-oriented \ninterest rates on loan and deposits); and \n(iv)  a phasing-out of government non-financial agencies and government-owned and \ncontrolled corporations in the implementation of credit programs  \n \n10.  A  sustainable  microfinance  sector  is  a  core  principle  of  BSP  regulations11  for \nmicrofinance. BSP regulations require \u201cinterest rates to be not lower than prevailing market \nrates\u201d to enable MFIs to recover financial and operational costs. For many years, it was believed \nthat the poor were \u201cbeneficiaries\u201d of microfinance who were unable to save, that those who did \nsave preferred non-financial forms, and that the poor could not afford the full cost of credit at \ncommercial rates. This earlier view led to an institutional response that was supply-led and \nfocused  on  subsidized  credit  programs  by  governments  and  international  donor  agencies. \nPrivate financial institutions, therefore, developed a high dependency on external borrowings \nand mobilization of savings was neglected. However, the poor are now viewed as bankable \n\u201cclients\u201d with high loan repayment rates and increasing savings, and provision of finance is \nincreasingly demand-driven rather than supply-led. Microfinance is considered to be an integral \npart of a well-functioning financial sector that includes poor people in economic flows and offers \nopportunities that support the growth of local markets. \n \n11.  The Philippine Government recognized that government-funded credit programs were \ncostly, inefficient, unsustainable and left many poor still lacking access despite a proliferation of \nprograms. Executive Order No. 138 issued in 1999 called for an end to subsidized, directed \ncredit programs and the transfer of government-directed credit programs to financial institutions. \nCredit subsidies were recognized as creating market distortions, weakening the rural banking \nsystem, and adding to the fiscal burden of the Government. DOF reported that as of end 2004, \nmost if not all of the direct credit programs have either been terminated or transferred to GFIs \nfor continued implementation. Providing subsidized government credit programs could \u201ccrowd \nout\u201d  private,  sustainable  microfinance  services,  and  would  run  counter  to  the  NCC  policy \nframework for microfinance.    \n \n12.  Although the Philippines is recognized for its microfinance sector, more than two-thirds \nof the 26 million poor, or 17 million people, have no access to it, and the country is still far from \nreaching its goal of providing access to microfinance services for all poor families. Recognizing \nthe importance of new entrants and of increased competition in the microfinance sector, BSP \ndeclared a partial moratorium on restrictions to allow establishment of microfinance-oriented \n                                                 \n11 BSP Circular 272. \n ", "  5\nbanks and microfinance lending windows for rural and thrift banks.12  A further relaxation of BSP \nregulations could facilitate more entry and competition. The definition/qualifications for banks to \nbe considered \u201cmicrofinance-oriented\u201d is limited, and restrictions on geographic location and \nfixed percentages of gross loan portfolio impede the expansion of sound financial institutions \nthat  could  provide  competitive,  efficient  microfinance  services.  Some  banks  have  also \nestablished NGOs in order to expand into restricted areas. This involves additional increased \ncost and administrative burden to the MFI and results in expansion of unregulated entities that \ncannot  provide  savings  services.  Increasing  expansion  of  deposit-taking  institutions  in \nmicrofinance is important not only to provide the savings services needed by the poor, but also \nto build the resources needed for sustainable microfinance. Although opening the sector for \nincreased competition may not entirely remove monopolistic pricing, the Consultative Group to \nAssist  the  Poor  (CGAP)  has  shown  that  increased  competition  can  reduce  the  pricing  of \nmicrofinance services, which is beneficial for the poor.  \n \n13.  A lack of standard disclosure practices across MFIs on total costs to the client also \nimpedes the development of a robust, competitive environment for microfinance. Although the \nbanks  have  established  truth-in-lending  guidelines  and  practices,  there  are  no  equivalent \nguidelines for cooperatives or NGO MFIs. This means that clients may not now the costs of \nborrowing and cannot effectively compare total costs among various providers of microfinance. \nInterest rates can be expressed in a variety of ways that are not transparent and do not reveal \ntotal costs. Practices vary among MFIs. Interest on microfinance loans, which is usually paid \nonce a week, can also be paid daily, monthly, or on another basis depending on the needs and \ncash  flow  capacities  of  clients.  Compulsory  deposits  or  compensatory  balances  and  other \ncharges and fees can also significantly increase the effective interest rate on funds borrowed. In \nthe banking sector, in 2004 and 2005 BSP required banks operating in microfinance to adopt \npractices  and  modify  truth  in  lending  forms  in  recognition  of  the  special  characteristics  of \nmicrofinance and the fact that many MFI clients may have limited financial education. However, \nthere are no established practices for the cooperative sector or NGO MFIs for truth-in-lending, \nand the majority of organizations are completely unaware of the Truth-in-Lending Act and \nrequirements for disclosure to protect borrowers. It is important that standard requirements for \ntruth in lending information and disclosure to microfinance clients are established for MFIs. \n \n14.  The tax regime for the microfinance sector is not specified, and there is a need for the \nBureau  of  Internal  Revenue  (BIR)  to  develop  revenue  regulations  for  clarification  of  tax \ntreatment in the sector. Presently, there is not a consistent application or enforcement of tax for \nMFIs within a particular class or type. Because of this uncertainty, there is confusion in the \nsector and some MFIs are deferring development plans pending resolution. Currently, there are \nincentives in the sector for MFIs to operate as NGOs, given the lack of restrictions on opening \nNGO branches, and as they pay no income or gross receipt tax. However, incentives for MFIs to \noperate as unregulated institutions (not authorized to accept deposits), promotes the expansion \nof  institutions  with  limited  sustainability.  This  ultimately  undermines  the  goal  of  achieving \nnationwide  sustainable  microfinance  services  for  the  poor.  The  need  to  commercialize \nmicrofinance in order to provide sustainable access to financial services is well recognized, and \nis part of the NCC microfinance policy. The profitability of microfinance operations has been \ndemonstrated  in  the  Philippines,  and  it  is  important  to  examine  whether  at  this  stage  tax \nexemption for microfinance is needed when the private sector can profitably operate such \nbusiness. In view of the current fiscal crisis in the Philippines, and the Government\u2019s ongoing \n                                                 \n12 Circulars 340 (2002); 365 (2003); 369 (2003). BSP Circulars providing rules and regulations for the establishment \nof branches and/or loan collection and disbursement points of microfinance-oriented banks and microfinance \u2013\noriented branches of regular banks.   \n ", "6   \nreview of tax policy and revenue measures, an examination of tax policy for the microfinance \nsector  should  be  undertaken  to  specify  tax  treatment  of  microfinance  transactions.  Any \nintroduction  of  taxes  could  be  phased  in  over  a  designated  period  to  provide  a  smooth \ntransition, and if there remains a need to provide tax incentives to MFIs to operate in remote \nareas, tax incentives could be offered for those designated areas to all types of MFIs for a fair, \ncompetitive, and robust market. \n  \n  2.  Regulatory and Supervisory Authorities \n \n15.  There is no single regulatory authority for entities providing microfinance services. Thrift \nbanks and rural banks are supervised by BSP; credit cooperatives are under the supervision of \nthe Cooperative Development Authority (CDA); and microfinance NGOs are not regulated or \nsupervised by any government agency. With no single authority, there have been both uneven \nstandards and fragmented supervision and regulation across MFIs. The following summarizes \nregulatory and monitoring frameworks for banks, cooperatives and MFI NGOs.  \n \n16.  Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP). BSP is the regulatory authority for all banking \ninstitutions including those engaged in microfinance. BSP recognizes microfinance-oriented \nbanks that are licensed, such as normal thrift or rural banks with additional requirements for \nmicrofinance.  BSP  circulars13  issued  in  2003  prescribe  detailed  reporting  on  microfinance \noperations and provide a formal minimum credit risk management guidelines, including the \nmeasurement of portfolio-at-risk and provisioning standards. As part of its regulatory mandate, \nBSP supervises and conducts regular examinations of banks. Examiners check for compliance \nwith  banking  laws,  rules  and  regulations;  soundness  of  systems  for  evaluating  credit; \nsupervision and collection of loans; and the quality of the loan portfolio. Recognizing that \nmicrofinance operations have special characteristics, in 2005 BSP will adopt a manual for the \nsupervision and examination of banks engaged in microfinance operations. Section 40 of the \nGeneral Banking Act of 2000 recognized the special characteristics of microfinance and directed \nthe Monetary Board to issue measures for microfinance. In that regard, BSP has issued a series \nof circulars to address microfinance operations and practices, and has reviewed its existing \nregulatory, supervisory and examination procedures and guidelines. More detailed information \non microfinance operations and performance by thrift and rural banks will be important for \nassessing the sector. In addition, data need to be made more accessible on the BSP website, \nwhich currently provides limited information on microfinance. \n \n17.  Cooperative  Development  Authority  (CDA).  Established  in  1990,  the  CDA  is \nmandated under the Cooperative Development Authority Republic Act No. 6939 (RA 6939) to \nprovide  oversight  functions  for  all  types  of  cooperatives14  including  savings  and  credit \ncooperatives. CDA extension offices are located in the cities of Dagupan, Naga, Iloilo, Cebu, \nCagayan de Oro, and Davao (Supplementary Appendix B). Credit cooperatives can mobilize \nmillions of pesos of deposits from members who are largely from low and middle-income \ngroups. In 2003, CDA reported savings of P6.9 billion and capital build-up and P3.5 billion in \n7,840 cooperatives. Some cooperatives are even larger than some rural and thrift banks, and \nthere is a need to institute prudential norms and oversight measures to protect cooperative \nmembers\u2019 deposits. The total number of registered cooperatives in the Philippines reported for \n2003 is 64,998, although the number of operating cooperatives was only 31,191. The large \n                                                 \n13 Circulars including 409 (2003). \n14 Cooperatives are associations organized for the economic and social betterment of their members, operating \nbusiness enterprises based on mutual aid and founded upon internationally accepted cooperative principles and \npractices. \n ", "  7\nalthough the number of operating cooperatives is only 31,191. The large percentage of inactive \nor failed cooperatives reflects the limited regulatory capacity and authority, among other factors. \n \n18.   CDA  registers  cooperatives  and  their  federations  and  unions,  and  requires  all \nregistrants to submit annual audited financial statements and general information sheets. CDA \ndoes not, however, supervise or examine the books of credit cooperatives, and lacks the data \nand management information systems to oversee them effectively. Data are not centralized at \nCDA headquarters or readily available to CDA officers in Manila, which significantly reduce \nCDA\u2019s  oversight  capacity.  Although  CDA  has  the  power  to  cancel  the  registration  of \ncooperatives for non-compliance with administrative requirements, it has not issued prudential \nrules  and  regulations  for  safe  and  sound  operation  of  cooperatives  in  savings  and  credit \nactivities. CDA has historically concentrated on development and promotion of cooperatives and \ntheir products and services, and regulation has been weak because of the conflicting mandates \nof  regulation  and  development,  insufficient  regulatory  power,  and  lack  of  uniform  and \ntransparent information on cooperatives. CDA was transferred from the Office of the President \nto  the  DOF  in  2004  to  strengthen  its  regulatory  and  oversight  functions  and  to  facilitate \ncoordination of policies and programs between DOF and CDA. Amendments to RA 6939 and \nthe Cooperative Code of the Philippines (RA 6938) were prepared by CDA and submitted to \nCongress in 2004. The reorganization of CDA is necessary for providing more focused oversight \nfor savings and credit cooperatives. \n \n19.  Cooperatives are a major MFI in the Philippines. Most of the 4,500 credit cooperatives \nand many of the over 18,000 other cooperatives provide microfinance services to their poor \nmembers. For a sound microfinance operation by the cooperative sector, CDA, in collaboration \nwith NCC, has developed a standard chart of accounts (SCA) and performance standards to be \napplied to credit and other types of cooperatives engaged in savings and credit services. The \nremaining challenge is to see these performance standards fully implemented by all financial \ncooperatives. This will need capacity building of cooperatives through training on credit risk \nmanagement,  accounting,  asset-liability  management,  corporate  governance,  and  other \nsubjects related to sound financial service operations. CDA is currently standardizing a training \nmodule on cooperative operations of credit and savings services. Training sessions based on \nthe  standard  curriculum  should  be  conducted  at  financial  cooperatives  by  cooperative \nassociations and unions accredited by CDA. There should also be training in the SCA and \nperformance standards developed by CDA for cooperatives engaged in financial services. Over \n2,500 cooperatives are registered every year. However, the current CDA registration system \nrequires  manual  reconciliation  and  verification.  Moreover,  only  15%  of  68,000  registered \ncooperatives (only about 28,000 of which are active) submit annual operational and financial \nstatus  accounts.  There  is  an  urgent  need  to  modernize  the  CDA  registration  system  and \nimprove cooperatives\u2019 compliance with CDA requirements. \n \n20.  Securities  Exchange  Commission  (SEC).  All  NGOs,  including  those  providing \nmicrofinance, register with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as non-stock, non-\nprofit  organizations,  and  are  required  to  file  annual  audited  financial  reports  and  general \ninformation sheets. Considered to be non-deposit-taking institutions, MFI NGOs are not subject \nto prudential regulation and supervision by any government regulatory authority. In practice, \nNGO MFIs do take \u201ccompulsory\u201d deposits (also known as capital build up and compensatory \nbalances)  from  borrower-clients.  Under  the  General  Banking  Act,  only  registered  banking \ninstitutions are allowed to accept deposits from the general public. However, BSP has been \ntaking a tolerant view of this practice as long as total deposits of the MFI NGO do not exceed \ntotal outstanding loan balances. MFI NGOs that collect savings beyond the  compensating \nbalance are encouraged to transform themselves into formal, regulated financial institutions \n ", "8   \n(credit cooperatives or rural or thrift banks). However, there are also concerns that some MFIs \nare illegally accepting individual voluntary deposits. With no effective monitoring mechanism in \nplace for monitoring this activity, it is difficult to assess these concerns fully. As these \u201cdeposit-\ntaking\u201d activities involve prudential issues that require regulation, there is a need to resolve this \nmatter. At best, MFI NGOs file only annual statements, and as can be seen in the sample of \nSEC documents referenced below, even these reports are not current for many institutions.  An \neffective information reporting system needs to be established if BSP is to oversee voluntary \ndeposit-taking properly.     \n \n21.  There is a general lack of data for MFI NGOs, and the lack of a current, uniform, and \ntransparent set of data for MFI NGOs is a significant issue. The majority of MFI NGOs do not \nuse the term \u201cmicrofinance\u201d to identify their business when registering with SEC, and therefore \nSEC  is  not  able  to  completely  identify  NGOs  that  operate  as  MFIs.  Common  business \ndescriptions such as \u201csocial development\u201d or \u201cfacilitating access to economic development \nactivities\u201d are often used. Although these are also indicative of NGO efforts, the failure to \ndisclose that an NGO is conducting microfinance lending operations prevents proper oversight \nand governance. A review of the latest filed SEC documents for 15 larger NGO MFIs found that, \nas of 15 May 2005, for 3 their most recent report was 2004, for 7 it was 2003, and for 5 it was \n2002. All of the 15 NGOs were members of the Microfinance Council of the Philippines, Inc. \n(MCPI), but only a few included microfinance as a stated business activity in their articles of \nincorporation. A few others stated that they \u201cfacilitated\u201d financial services but did not indicate \nthat they directly \u201cprovided\u201d financial services, although they were known to be providers of \nmicrofinance loans. Disclosure in annual information sheets is similarly lacking. One NGO \namended its articles of incorporation to eliminate \u201cmicrofinance\u201d from the name of the NGO, \nalthough it continued to provide microfinance services and to be a member of the MCPI.   \n \n22.  To  facilitate  proper  oversight  and  transparency,  articles  of  incorporation  should  be \namended to include microfinance as an authorized activity if NGOs provide such services.  In \naddition, the annual information sheets, which are in summary form, could be modified to \ninclude a box to be checked if microfinance activities are being conducted. This would facilitate \nreview by SEC and other authorities. MCPI tracks the performance of its members, although \nthis information has been limited because submission is voluntary, and data is published 10 \nmonths after year-end. However, there is potential for MCPI to play a stronger role as a center \nfor broader data collection on MFIs beyond its membership. MCPI, established in 1997, is a \nnetwork of 34 institutions (26 practitioners, mostly NGOs, and 8 service providers) working \ntowards the rapid development of the microfinance industry.15 Membership requirements include \n(i) a mission statement with a vision for the poor; (ii) a minimum of 3,000 clients; (iii) a minimum \nloan portfolio of Php10 million; (iv) a three-year track record; (v) an operations manual and \nmanagement information system (MIS); and (vii) SEC documents. \n \n3.  Institutional Capacity and Efficiency of MFIs \n \n23.  Limited competition in the microfinance sector has resulted in weak incentives for MFIs \nto build capacity, improve efficiencies, or lower the cost of services to clients. It is known that \nmicrofinance clients in the Philippines can and do pay high rates for borrowing, and that access \nis more important to the poor than cost. MFI rates are higher than those of other commercial \nlenders because of the high transaction and operating costs for lending and collecting (e.g., \n                                                 \n15 As of 31 December 2003, 21 members had a total gross loan portfolio of P2,334,494,701 and 578,493 active \nborrowers, indicting an average loan amount of P4,035 per client. MCPI. 2003 Performance Monitoring Report. \nManila. \n ", "  9\ndaily or weekly collection visits in often difficult to reach locations). Some of these costs are due \nto poor physical infrastructure (such as roads) in rural areas and the need for frequent client \nvisits. However some operating costs could be reduced through efficiencies. The fact that MFI \nclients have been noted to value access over cost should not be used as an excuse to justify \nany price, or to ignore the potential for greater outreach through competitive pricing. \n \n24.  The development and adoption of sound performance standards, SCA, and disclosure \nand  reporting  practices  will  help  ensure  that  MFIs  are  viable  and  sustainable  allow  the \nperformance of different types of MFIs to be compared and evaluated, which is difficult under \nthe  current  fragmented  regulatory  framework.  For  the  MFI  NGOs,  MCPI  has  adopted \nperformance standards and formulated a SCA, although these have not been widely adopted. \nThe chart of accounts is being reviewed to make it comparable with those for other types of \nMFIs. For credit cooperatives and other cooperatives offering savings and credit services, CDA \nhas developed a chart of accounts and performance standards.16 It has issued circulars17 \nrequiring adoption of the SCA and performance standards, and a transitional period of 1 year \nwas allowed to enable implementation by 2004. Although there has been some progress, the \nmajority of cooperatives have not yet adopted the chart of accounts or performance standards, \nand capacity building will be important if they are to be implemented effectively. In recognition of \nthe  need  for  common  standards,  NCC  and  a  technical  working  group  composed  of \nrepresentatives from microfinance practitioners and other stakeholders reviewed the existing set \nof performance standards and formulated a common set to be applied across all types of MFIs.  \nNCC announced the common standards in November 2004, and MFI NGOs, cooperatives and \nbanks with microfinance operations will move towards adopting these standards.   \n \n25.  The institutional capacity of MFIs is a significant constraint on increasing their size and \nenabling sustainable outreach to the poor.18  Major capacity building is needed if management \nis to gain the skills needed. Currently, many MFIs lack basic skills for sustainable, effective, and \nefficient delivery of microfinance services to the poor. Inefficiencies lead to higher operating \ncosts and to unnecessarily high interest rates for the poor. Skills need to be developed in \n(i) management, (ii) financial reporting and disclosure, (iii) credit and cash flow analysis, (iv) risk \nmanagement,  (v) performance  monitoring  systems  and  standards  for  MFIs,  and  (vi) best \npractices for sustainable microfinance. Donor assistance, including ADB TA, is helping to build \nMFI capacity and increase social mobilization.19 Longer term support for the rapidly growing \nmicrofinance industry would benefit from university and training institute programs and the \nconsolidation of current training programs and materials in a free national archive.  \n \n26.  A credit information bureau (CIB) including microfinance is important infrastructure to \nincrease financial transparency and promote a more efficient microfinance sector. In the current \nenvironment where there is a lack of credit information, many MFIs are reluctant to lend above \nP50,000. There is a gap in supply of loans in the range from P50,000 to P150,000 (maximum \nallowed), not due to a lack of available funds but to institutions\u2019 desire to diversify their portfolios \nand lower their risk. Better credit information could assist MFIs with risk management and help \nto improve the provision of microfinance to clients. With a rapidly expanding microfinance \n                                                 \n16 Technical assistance support was provided by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). \n17 The CDA \u201cCOOP-PESOS\u201d standards include administrative and performance standards for  (i) portfolio quality, \n(ii) efficiency, (iii) stability, (iv) operations, and (v) structure of assets. \n18 Fernando, Nimal. 2004. Delivering to the Poor: A Search for Successful Practices in Philippine Microfinance. \nPresented at the UNDP-National Anti-Poverty Commission Conference on Microfinance, Manila, 22 June. \n19 ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the Republic of the Philippines for Enhancing Access of the Poor to \nMicrofinance Services in Frontier Areas. Manila (approved December 2004 in the amount of $250,000 funded by \nthe Governance Cooperation Fund). \n ", "10  \nmarket, it is important to develop a microcredit information system that is useful to the full range \nof MFIs engaged in microfinance including MFI NGOs, rural banks, and cooperatives. The MDP \nwill support the establishment of a central CIB, including coverage of microfinance, to replace \nthe existing system of fragmented credit bureaus. A private nationwide credit bureau has been \nin place at the Bankers Association of the Philippines (BAP) since 1990. However, this system \nis limited to negative-file information only, and is accessible only to commercial banks. 20 \n \n4.  Financial Literacy, Gender Education, and Consumer Protection \n \n27.  Greater financial literacy among potential microfinance clients is needed to (i) introduce \nthe  poor  to  a  formal  or  semiformal,  market-oriented  institutional  environment,  (ii)  promote \neffective access and utilization of microfinance services, and (iii) ensure adequate knowledge of \nrights and obligations of microfinance clients. A national program for financial literacy is needed \nto  achieve  the  nationwide  expansion  of  microfinance  envisioned  in  the  Philippines.  The \nGovernment also recognizes the importance of educating women on their financial rights within \nfamilies. Although most borrowers from MFIs are women, concerns remain about management \nof funds once they are within the family unit. In addition, single women are not approved for \nloans under some lending methods, unless they can prove that they are head of the household. \nThis type of bias, and impact on women\u2019s development needs to be addressed. Significant \nresources will be needed for a comprehensive national program. NAPC, through the Joining \nArms  Together  Against  Poverty  (KALAHI)21  network,  and  in  coordination  with  concerned \nagencies,  can  provide  an  organizational  framework  for  a  sustainable  national  program. \nIncreasing financial literacy is essential if the poor are to be helped to obtain access to financial \nservices, and be protected from false and misleading or illegal practices. Such a program \nshould include information on the Truth in Lending Act and required disclosure forms, and other \nlaws and regulations applicable to microfinance services and products. Insurance is a particular \narea of concern, as the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) has discovered \nthat  some  MFIs  are  forcing  the  poor  to  purchase  insurance  policies  in  order  to  access \nmicrofinance  services,  and  selling  insurance  without  proper  license,  authority,  or  actuarial \nvaluation/reserves  to  ensure  payment  of  obligations.  The  poor  need  access  to  insurance \nservices in a safe and sound system and in accordance with the law.      \n \n28.  To strengthen consumer protection for the poor and users of microfinance, relevant laws \nand  regulations  need  to  be  reviewed  to  ensure  consumer  protection  for  the  poor  and \nmicrofinance  sector,  including  adequate  systems  for  addressing  consumer  complaints.  To \nfacilitate a system that is friendly and practical to the poor and to those in rural areas, an \naffordable system for making inquiries, filing complaints, and mediation in rural and provincial \nareas should be established. NAPC, in coordination with the relevant agencies, could lead \ndevelopment of a national system to effectively encompass the poor and disadvantaged groups. \nEstablishment of a compliance officer in each MFI responsible for compliance of applicable laws \nand regulations is important to ensure sound operations, and to protect the poor and users of \nmicrofinance services from illegal and unsound practices. Designation of an officer in the MFI to \nbe the compliance officer will not raise the operating overhead costs of the MFI, but will ensure \nsound and sustainable operations.    \n \n                                                 \n20 Source: Bankers Association of the Philippines. \n21 Pursuant to Memorandum Circular No. 33 Institutionalizing Kapit Bisig Laban sa Kahirapan (KALAHI) as the \nGovernment\u2019s Program for Poverty Reduction issued November 2002, the Government through KALAHI, will solicit \nactive participation of basic sector organizations, other society organizations, and the business sector in its poverty \nreduction programs or activities. This multistakeholder and interagency convergence policy is applied in all NAPC \npoverty reduction initiatives.  \n ", "  11\n5.  Savings Mobilization, Remittances, and New Technologies  \n \n29.  Mobilization of savings is essential for sustainable national microfinance. Historically, the \ndependence of MFIs on subsidized credits from the Government, donors, and lending agencies \nled to weak savings mobilization. As MFI\u2019s savings deposits increase, so does the pool of \nresources  for  MFIs  to  improve  services  and  expand  outreach.  The  NCC  strategy  for \nmicrofinance has turned away from promotion of subsidized credits towards mobilization of \nsavings deposits. Allowing banks to expand and open branches will help to mobilize savings. \nOne potential source for rapid mobilization of savings in the Philippines is remittances from \noverseas Filipino workers (OFWs). Money transfers and remittance services are important to \nmany poor, although many have no access to such services through formal channels. Instead \nthey rely on informal channels such as physical transportation of cash across borders and other \nmethods. BSP reported $8.6 billion in overseas Filipino workers remittances to the Philippines \nthrough formal channels in 2004. An equal, or even greater amount, is considered by some to \nbe channeled through informal channels into the Philippines. If MFIs could capture 5% of the \ninformal remittance flows, this would translate into $430 million. Capturing 15% of informal \nremittance flows would translate into $1.29 billion. A large portion of such remittances would go \nto a variety of household and family expenditures, but the remainder could remain in an MFI \ndeposit account rather than at home or at a neighbor\u2019s for safekeeping. \n \nTable 1: Potential Savings Mobilization through Remittancesa \n($ millions) \n \n  Projected percentage of informal \nremittance flows captured by  \nPercentage of \nmicrofinance institutions \nremittances retained \n($) \nas savings \n5%=$430  10%=$860  15%=$1,290 \n(%) \nmillion  million  million \n5  21.5   43.0  64.5 \n10  43.0  86.0  129.0 \n15  64.5  129.0  193.5 \n  a\n Assumes estimated $8.6 billion in informal remittance flows. \n  Source:  ADB estimates. \n \n30.  To facilitate the depositing of remittances directly into the accounts of regulated deposit-\ntaking MFIs (rural banks, thrift banks, credit and savings cooperatives), a regulatory framework \nis  needed.  Enabling  these  sectors  to  capture  informal  remittance  flows,  could  significantly \nincrease MFI savings deposits and provide a vital service to the poor. It could accelerate the \nexpansion and outreach of sustainable microfinance and lower the cost of loans to the poor. \nThe cost of funds raised through savings mobilization is significantly lower that the cost of funds \nprovided to MFIs by government financial institutions for onlending. Not only does savings \nmobilization provide resources for sustainable national outreach of microfinance services\u2014it \nultimately lowers the cost of credit to the poor. \n \n31.  New cell-phone-based technologies can also significantly lower the cost of remittances \nand money transfers into deposit accounts. The Philippines is the international leader in this \narea, and is rapidly adapting products and services to meet the needs of OFWs and the public. \nRegulations are needed to support the transfer of remittances into deposit accounts of regulated \nMFIs using cell-phone-based technology. Clear rules are needed for MFIs to be approved as \n ", "12  \nremittance centers. Specific regulations are needed for centers that receive remittances only in \npesos (and therefore do not need a foreign exchange facility). The Philippines is in a unique \nposition to establish best practice guidelines and regulations for cell phone technology that \ncould provide a global model. \n \n32.  An  estimated  43%  of  Filipinos,  or  36  million  people,  use  cellular  phones  and  the \npenetration rate is expected to increase by year-end 2005. A used cell phone can be purchased \nfor as low as P500, and a SIM card/phone number can be purchased for around P200\u2013P300, \nenabling cell phone access to many persons. Entrepreneurs with cell phones are also providing \npayment services to persons without cell phones or living in remote areas without cellular \nservice. This is an important service for microentrepreneurs living in remote areas who can not \nafford the time to personally visit an MFI to make loan payments, but have the capacity to repay. \nPayment by cell phone could result in a savings of 6\u20138 hours that could be used for productive \nwork in the microenterprise or livelihood activity. One service provider\u2019s tie-up arrangement with \nthe Rural Bankers Association of the Philippines (RBAP) and the Microenterprise Access to \nBanking Services Program (MABS),22 helps to facilitate disbursement and collection of loans via \ncell phone. The National Confederation of Cooperatives, Inc. (NATCCO) has also aligned with a \nservice provider to enhance loan services  and implement livelihood programs  for member \ncooperatives. The outreach opportunities for transfer and payment services are great, and the \ndevelopments underway for an alliance among major mobile operators in the Asia-Pacific that \nwill  support  regional  mobile  infrastructure  for  a  common  service  platform  that  will  allow \nseamless cross-border services.23 Remittances via cell phones are expected to gain significant \nmarket share especially in rural areas with weak financial infrastructure.            \n \n6.  External Assistance \n \n33.  Significant external assistance has been provided by funding agencies and donors to the \nPhilippines for the microfinance sector. ADB assistance will complement this assistance, and \nbuild upon sector developments and progress to date. ADB will continue coordination with \nagencies during the implementation of the MDP to ensure effective allocation of resources and \ncoordination among agencies active in this sector. Sector projects include the United States \nAgency  for  International  Development  (USAID)-funded  programs\u23afMABS,  Credit  Policy \nImprovement Program (CPIP), and the Credit Union Empowerment and Strengthening Program \nII  (CUES-II).  The  German  Agency  for  Technical  Cooperation  (GTZ)  Small  and  Medium \nEnterprise Program provides capacity building for financial institutions and a training program \nfor SME lending for privately owned rural banks, and thrift banks in the Visayas region. The \nMicrofinance Sector Strengthening Project (MSSP) funded by the United Nations Development \nProgramme  (UNDP)  and  the  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development  (AusAID) \nprovides technical assistance including training to MFIs on the ASA methodology of individual \nlending, and documents successful practices and case studies of MFIs. The Japan Bank for \nInternational Cooperation (JBIC) has conducted a pilot study on sustainable microfinance for \npoverty reduction, and assistance from the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) \nincludes access to the Canada Fund for Local Initiatives and the Private Enterprise Accelerated \nResource Linkages (PEARL) Project. Agencies providing credit facilities for onlending to micro, \nsmall and medium enterprises include International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD); \nKfW, and the World Bank. Additional information on these projects and planned assistance is \nprovided in the Development Coordination Matrix (see Appendix 6). \n                                                 \n22 Supported by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). \n23 Announcement in July 2005 of alliance of eight mobile operators including Bridge Mobile (which includes Globe \nTelecom) for development of regional mobile infrastructure. \n ", "  13\n \n7.  Lessons Learned \n \n34.  The Philippines\u2019 country assistance program evaluation (CAPE)24 noted that ADB can \nplay a pivotal role in helping the Philippines to reduce poverty and promote social development, \nand that ADB\u2019s future lending operations can focus on such areas as microcredit to support \nincome-generating  activities  of  the  poor.  It  was  also  noted  that  emphasis  should  be  on \nsustainability rather than the speed of implementation of reforms, recognizing the limitations that \ncan arise from stakeholder consultation and democratic process. The CAPE included two NGO \nmicrocredit projects25 approved in 1988 and 1991, and noted the success of the projects in \ncreating income-generating activities of the poor. ADB\u2019s experience in microcredit lending has \nheightened staff awareness of a number of important project design features. Reaching the very \npoor, particularly in the Philippine context, requires a high degree of social preparation of \ntargeted beneficiaries who are identified by a means test. Microenterprises, like any other \nbusiness, need continuous access to reasonably priced credit for sustainability and expansion. \nThe Rural Microenterprise Finance Project,26 approved in 1996, was based on findings of a \nnumber of evaluations of microcredit programs that showed: (i) subsidized loans provided to \nend-borrowers at below market rates encouraged corruption and often reached the local elite \nrather than target groups of lower-income borrowers; (ii) credit subsidies provided at the local \nlevel frequently discouraged institutional savings mobilization; (iii) where microcredit had been \nprovided  by  institutions  at  commercial  interest  rates,  and  where  local  savings  have  been \nmobilized, loans tended to be widely available and repayment rates high; and (iv) when credit \nsubsidies were replaced by commercial microfinance, there could be substantial savings to \ngovernments and funding sources. Lessons learned27 from ADB\u2019s microfinance operations are \nsimilar to those learned by other funding agencies and those reported in the CGAP guidelines \nand papers. \n \n(i)  The financial system approach is the key to achieving sustainable results and to \nmaximizing development impact. This approach emphasizes an enabling policy \nenvironment,  financial  infrastructure,  and  financial  intermediaries  that  are \ncommitted to achieving financial viability and sustainability within a reasonable \nperiod and that can provide a variety of financial services, not just credit, to the \npoor. \n \n(ii)  Microfinance  clients  are  more  concerned  about  access  to  services  that  are \ncompatible with their requirements than about the cost of services, and, given the \ndiversity of demand for financial services, a broad range of institutional types is \nrequired. \n \n(iii)  Strong retail institutions committed to outreach and sustainability are essential for \npermanently extending the reach of financial services and having a significant \nimpact  on  poverty  reduction.  Financial  institutions  committed  to  providing \nmicrofinance services in most developing member countries require considerable \nTA for capacity building. \n                                                 \n24 ADB. 2003.

Expanding the outreach of savings \nservices can have a significant impact on both institutional sustainability and \npoverty reduction. \n  \n(v)  Because microfinance is primarily targeted at the poor who are disadvantaged, \nsocial mobilization is necessary to introduce them to a formal or semi-formal, \nmarket-oriented institutional environment.   \n \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n \nA.   Objectives and Scope \n \n35.  The goal of the MDP is to assist Government to reduce poverty and promote sustainable \neconomic growth. The MDP supports the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) of eradicating \nextreme poverty and hunger, promoting gender equality and empowering women. The MDP will \ncontribute to these goals by achieving its objective of ensuring permanent access to sustainable \ninstitutional  financial  services  for  a  majority  of  poor  and  low-income  households  and  their \nmicroenterprises at competitive prices. A national financial literacy program, including gender \ntraining and consumer protection, will empower the poor and promote effective access and \nutilization of microfinance services. MDP will assist the Government to build viable MFIs , and \nimprove  the  performance  of  the  microfinance  sector,  including  reducing  transaction  costs \nassociated with delivery of financial services and thereby increase sustained access to financial \nservices by the poor. The poor will have opportunities to increase incomes and employment and \nimprove their quality of life through access to sustainable and more responsive microfinance \nservices  including  money  transfer  and  remittance  services  that  support  investment  and \nproduction.28  A Design and Monitoring Framework is included in Appendix 2. \n \nB.   Policy Framework and Actions \n \n36.  The policy framework and actions that have been agreed with the Government are \ndescribed in the development policy letter and the attached policy matrix in Appendix 3. The key \nmeasures are summarized as follows. \n \n1.  Enhance  the  Enabling  and  Regulatory  Environment  and  Remove \nRegulatory  Impediments  and  Policy  Distortions  to  Promote  Market \nEfficiencies and Increased Outreach of Services at Competitive Prices to \nthe Poor  \n \n37.   The Program will support development of the regulatory framework for a sustainable \nmicrofinance, and remove regulatory restrictions on competition and the expansion of sound \nMFIs. BSP regulations will be issued providing greater flexibility in bank branching for financially \nsound and well-managed banks, including those catering to the micro, small and medium \nenterprises. Disclosure and transparency will be increased in the sector, and truth-in-lending will \nbe introduced to all types of MFIs to ensure that costs of borrowing are fully disclosed to the \npoor. Disclosure practices will be strengthened and standardized so that costs of borrowing can \nbe effectively compared across all types of MFIs. Revenue regulations will be issued specifying \n                                                 \n28 In connection with the MDP, should a need arise in the future, a partial credit guarantee (PCG) facility may be \nestablished. \n ", "  15\nthe tax treatment of microfinance transactions, and clarifying the tax regime for MFIs and other \nentities engaged in microfinance, for consistent enforcement. To facilitate remittance flows to \nthe  Philippines,  including  to  MFIs  in  remote  areas,  and  to  lower  the  cost  of  transfer  of \nremittances from OFWs, rules and regulations will be issued to support application of cell phone \nbased technology for low cost transfers and payments. This will encompass regulations for e-\nbanking transactions including e-payment transactions and e-value transfers made through non-\nbank institutions including, but not limited to, peer-to-peer transfers, remittances, small value \ntransfers and stored value transfers. The Program will promote the mobilization of savings in \nMFIs  through  facilitation  of  direct  deposit  of  remittances  into  MFI  accounts.  The  savings \nmobilization will provide a lower-cost source of funds for MFIs, which in turn will lower the cost \nof credit to the poor. Savings mobilization is also essential to provide the resources necessary \nfor increased outreach and sustainable microfinance services. The Program will support the \nestablishment of an accurate, reliable and transparent set of data for all types of MFIs, and \ndevelopment  of  a  free  national  sector  database  in  NAPC.  To  increase  transparency  and \ndisclosure of MFI NGOs, a regulation will be issued under the Corporation Code requiring \nNGOs providing microfinance and other related financial services to disclose this information to \nthe SEC. To support collaborative action among Government, the banking community, the \ncooperative sector, the NGO sector and the donor community, a Philippine Declaration on \nMicrofinance will be issued towards fulfilling the MDGs and the MTDP 2004-2010. \n \n2.  Build  Viable  MFIs  that  can  Provide  Efficient  and  Cost-Effective  Retail \nDelivery of Services to the Poor  \n \n38.  To  increase  efficiencies  of  MFIs,  government  regulatory  agencies,  GFIs,  and  other \nstakeholders will join together through a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) to adopt and \nimplement  NCC  MFI  performance  standards,  effective  immediately.  The  MOA  was  signed \nOctober 2005. The performance standards will assist the MFIs in efficient, cost-effective delivery \nof microfinance services to the poor, and include credit risk management, operational efficiency, \nfinancial efficiency, and stability standards based on international best practices. To support a \nfast implementation, training modules on the uniform set of MFI performance standards will be \ndeveloped and software will be designed to assist MFI management in the implementation and \nmonitoring of performance. To strengthen governance of MFIs, minimum qualifications and fit \nand proper standards for board directors and key management will be established for savings \nand credit cooperatives. Internal management systems including requirements for mandatory \ncommittees for audit, credit, election, education/training, ethics, and mediation and conciliation, \nwill also be established for savings and credit cooperatives. To support a robust credit market \nincluding microfinance, and to facilitate access to credit at lower cost, draft legislation to support \nestablishment  of  a  credit  information  system  and  a  central  credit  information  bureau  was \nsubmitted to Congress. ADB plans to invest up to $1 million or 25% of the project cost in the \nCIB with BSP owning up to 49% of the shares. CDA will issue a Directive requiring savings and \ncredit cooperatives to collect information on microfinance clients for credit information system \nfor microfinance. To promote expansion of business development services (BDS) for the poor, \nNAPC in cooperation with the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) and private sector BDS \nproviders will issue guidelines and model BDS manuals for widespread dissemination to MFIs \nand free access. NAPC will conduct agency and stakeholder consultations and issue Industry \nAdvisories  to  promote  adoption  of  sound,  sustainable  microfinance  schemes,  including \nmicroinsurance and savings/microinvestment, to support the development and expansion of \nviable MFIs with products and services in compliance with existing laws.   \n \n39.  The Program will support formulating a privatization plan and options for the Philippine \nPostal Savings Bank (PPSB), and preparing an assessment and valuation of PPSB for DOF\u2019s \n ", "16  \nPrivatization and Management Office and PPSB Board of Directors with a view to bringing in \nstrategic investment for an accelerated outreach of savings and remittance services in rural and \nremote areas. Mobilization of savings through postal savings networks can be an effective way \nto expand outreach and provide essential services to the rural poor in remote areas. Maintaining \nsynergies with the postal infrastructure will be important to achieve national outreach. TA will be \nprovided as required to support PPSB in the planning and preparation of a privatization plan and \noptions.  \n \n3.  Strengthen  Regulatory  and  Supervisory  Capacities  and  Oversight  for  a \nSound Microfinance Sector \n \n40.  To promote a sound cooperative sector, legislative amendments have been submitted to \namend Cooperative Development Authority RA No. 6939 and RA Act No. 6938 Cooperative \nCode of the Philippines to allow restructuring of the CDA into a full regulatory body and to \nprovide enhanced authority and powers to CDA to effectively regulate cooperatives, including \nthe power to approve and implement standards, rules and regulations, and guidelines for the \nvarious types of cooperatives, and power for joint regulation of cooperative banks by CDA and \nBSP. CDA was transferred from the Office of the President to DOF to strengthen regulatory and \noversight  functions  of  CDA  over  the  cooperative  sector,  and  to  facilitate  development  of \nregulation  and  supervision  of  credit  and  savings  cooperatives.  A  reorganization  plan  to \nstrengthen CDA regulatory oversight of savings and credit cooperatives, including offices for \nmonitoring  financial  performance  of  savings  and  credit  cooperatives  will  be  prepared  and \ncapacity building provided for CDA staff to support implementation. Assistance will also be \nprovided for developing the CDA registration and database systems, which are recognized as \nseverely lacking for effective monitoring and oversight.  \n \n 41.  Regional  stakeholder  consultations  will  be  conducted  by  CDA  and  DOF  for  the \ndevelopment  of  prudential  rules  and  regulations  for  savings  and  credit  cooperatives,  and \nprudential rules and regulations will be issued by CDA for savings and credit cooperatives, to \nensure safe and sound operations of the more than 4,500 savings and credit cooperatives and \nto protect the investments and savings of the poor. CDA will issue a manual of prudential rules \nand regulations in collaboration with DOF, NCC, and BSP. BSP regulations will be issued to \nstrengthen audit and risk management committees, and the scope of examination for safe and \nsound conduct of business. Supervision guidelines will be issued by BSP to pilot risk-based \nsupervision  for  banks.  Risk  based  supervision  for  microfinance  will  be  adopted  and \nimplemented by BSP, and supervision and examination manuals issued for supervising banks \nengaged in microfinance recognizing the special characteristics of operations.   \n \n4.  Increase Financial Literacy and Consumer Protection for the Poor  \n \n42.  The MDP will support development of a national financial literacy program, including \ngender education and consumer protection, with NAPC as the lead implementing agency. The \nfinancial literacy program is envisioned to increase awareness of the poor people and the \ngeneral public as well, on the basic concepts and importance of microfinance and other forms of \nfinancial intermediation, and on managing financial resources, both in the household and local \neconomy.  NAPC will work through the KALAHI network and the NAPC member agencies which \ninclude 24 national government agencies, local government units, 14 NAPC Basic Sectoral \nCouncils,  microfinance  providers,  and  microfinance  training  institutions/technical  service \nproviders,  for  dissemination  and  adoption  of  the  program.  In  collaboration  with  these \nagencies/sectors, NAPC will determine the scope and the design of the program to achieve a \ngreater and wider expansion for microfinance access by the poor in the country. Assistance will \n ", "  17\nbe  provided  under  the  MDP  to  support  institutionalization  and  expansion  of  sustainable \nmicrofinance education in primary and secondary schools, state colleges and universities, and \ntraining centers. The NAPC will facilitate integration of the financial literacy program into the \nvarious existing extension, training and education programs and projects of some of its member \nagencies including Department of Education, Commission for Higher Education, Department of \nLabor and Employment, Department of Interior and Local Government, Department of Social \nWelfare and Development, Department of Agrarian Reform, Department of Environment and \nNatural Resources, People\u2019s Credit and Finance Corporation, CDA, National Commission on \nthe Role of Filipino Women, and National Commission on Indigenous People. The NAPC Basic \nSectoral Councils will also promote adoption of the financial literacy program in the respective \ncouncils\u2019 member organizations\u2019 training and education activities.   \n      \n43.  NAPC will establish a free public access website to support consumer protection and \nprovide a consumer action channel for the poor. The free public access website will include \ncapacity for the public to make inquiries and file complaints online for MFIs not in compliance \nwith Philippine laws and regulations. NAPC will submit complaints to relevant authorities and \npublish annually the number and type of complaints received in NAPC\u2019s Annual Report to the \nPresident and Congress. To facilitate access by the poor to computer and internet facilities, \nNAPC will enter into strategic partnerships with public and private organizations nationwide.  \nNAPC will issue a guidebook on consumer protection for the poor and users of microfinance \nservices, including information on Philippines\u2019 procedures for filing consumer complaints and \npublish  the  guidebook  on  NAPC\u2019s  free  public  access  website  and  distribute  it  to  industry \nassociations,  LGUs,  MFIs  and  consumer  and  basic  sector  groups.  Under  the  Program, \nrequirements will also be established for MFIs to have a designated compliance officer to \nensure regulated MFIs understanding and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. \n \nC.  Financing Plan \n \n44.  It is proposed that ADB support the Government\u2019s policy reforms by providing a loan of \n$150 million. The Borrower will be the Republic of the Philippines. The loan will be from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources with a 15-year term, an interest rate determined in accordance with \nADB's London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, and a commitment charge \nof 0.75% per annum, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the Loan Agreement. At \nGovernment\u2019s request, the grace period was extended from three to five years due to the \npoverty reduction target of the MDP. The loan proceeds are expected to be utilized over a \nperiod of 24 months from the date of loan effectiveness.  \n \n45.  The  proposed  loan  size  is  based  upon  the  program\u2019s  development  impact,  the \nimportance of the sector, and the associated adjustment costs related to the structural reforms. \nA  national  financial  literacy  program  for  the  poor  will  require  substantial  resources  and \ncommitment from Government over the near and medium term. On a per person basis, $150 \nmillion translates into less than $6 per person during this initial phase, assuming that poor \nindividuals currently accessing microfinance services also need the proper education to fully \nunderstand the services and products offered, and their rights and obligations. The total costs of \na  national  financial  program  are  expected  to  be  far  greater  than  this  amount,  and  it  is \nrecognized that even persons not classified as poor need the appropriate training for financial \nliteracy  to  ensure  safe  and  sound  financial  activities  and  protection  of  their  money.  \nEnhancement of regulatory authorities capacities and oversight will also result in significant \ncosts. \n \n ", "18  \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n46.  DOF will be the Executing Agency for the MDP and provide overall guidance for project \nimplementation. The NCC Secretariat has been nominated by the Secretary of Finance to be \nthe  program  management  unit  (PMU)  to  oversee  implementation  of  the  program  and  to \ncoordinate  activities  among  the  participating  agencies.  The  NCC  inter-agency  committees \nchaired by DOF, including representatives from NEDA and the participating agencies BIR, BSP, \nCDA, PPSB, SEC, and NAPC, will provide ongoing forums to facilitate sector reforms. \n \n47.  Inclusive social planning will be achieved through NAPC and the Government\u2019s KALAHI \nprogram, which provides a voice to indigenous peoples and other disadvantaged groups. Direct \nfield research, surveys, and consultations with the poor and disadvantaged, are also part of \nNAPC\u2019s mandate as the oversight body under the Social Reform and Poverty Alleviation Act \n(RA  8425)  for  the  development  and  strengthening  of  the  microfinance  industry.  This  act \nidentifies the disadvantaged sectors of Philippine society (also referred to as the \u201cbasic sectors\u201d) \nas farmers  and landless rural workers, artisanal fisherfolk, urban poor, indigenous cultural \ncommunities  and  indigenous  peoples,  workers  in  the  formal  sector  and  migrant  workers, \nworkers in the informal sector, women, youth and students, persons with disabilities, victims of \ndisasters and calamities, nongovernment organizations, children, and cooperatives. Through \nKALAHI, NAPC solicits the active participation of \u201cbasic sector\u201d organizations, other civil society \norganizations, and the business sector in its poverty reduction programs and activities. This \nmulti-stakeholder and interagency convergence policy is applied in all NAPC poverty reduction \ninitiatives.  Sectoral  councils,  formed  by  members  of  each  \u201cbasic  sector\u201d,  nominate \nrepresentatives for appointment by the President of the Republic.29 \n \n48.  Existing poverty mapping systems at the local level will be used to assess the impact of \nthe Program and determine access poverty. The community-based monitoring system (CBMS), \nestablished by the Department of Interior and Local Government, collects relevant, timely, and \nlocal access poverty indicators. Under this system, local government units (LGUs) collect 13 \nsurvival, security and enabling indicators annually that gauge access to education, health, and \nother vital services. The CBMS data allow for detailed poverty mapping at the local level and for \ntargeting and monitoring of interventions, based on knowledge of the specific determinants of \naccess poverty at the household level. In addition, data from other poverty mapping initiatives, \nincluding those of the Peace Equity Foundation and the National Statistical Coordination Board, \nwill  be  used  to  assess  program  impact.  NAPC  is  responsible  for  local  poverty  indicator \nmonitoring, and NAPC under its mandate from the Social Reform and Poverty Alleviation Act \nalso tracks key data on microfinance services and outreach, including gender impact. NAPC \nsubmits an annual report to Congress and the President. \n \n49.  In 1999, the Government initiated the public expenditure management improvement \nprogram.  This  consists  of  three  major  and  interrelated  components:  (i)  the  medium-term \nexpenditure framework (MTEF), (ii) the sector effectiveness and efficiency review, and (iii) the \norganizational performance indicator framework.  The MTEF aims to restructure the budget over \nthe medium term to better support the Government\u2019s development plan and improve operational \nefficiency by ensuring predictability of resources. The MTEF requires departments and agencies \nto formulate 3-year budgets consonant with the 3-year departmental baseline budgets issued by \nthe Department of Budget and Management (DBM). The sector effective and efficiency review \naims to strengthen and systematize the budget prioritization process in line with the MTDP. \n                                                 \n29 Sectoral representatives serve for a term of 3 years as members of NAPC along with heads of government bodies \nand presidents of the Leagues of Local Government Units (LGUs). \n ", "  19\nConducted by individual departments and agencies under the guidance of NEDA, it evaluates \nexisting  budgetary  programs,  activities,  and  projects  on  the  basis  of  their  importance  in \nachieving desired sector and department outcomes. The sector effectiveness and efficiency \nreview  is  used  to  improve  and  update  the  Medium-Term  Public  Investment  Program  and \nprepare agency budget proposals. The organizational performance indicator framework requires \ndepartments  and  agencies  to  specify  their  outcomes/outputs,  indicators  of  performance, \naccomplishments  and  targets,  and  the  corresponding  budgetary  allocations  for  related \nprograms, activities, and projects. This framework will eventually be tied to the performance \nassessment  of  individual  officials  and  employees  of  the  Government.  These  initiatives \nstrengthen  Government\u2019s  public  financial  management  system,  and  show  Government\u2019s \ncommitment for sound financial management.30 Overall financial management arrangements for \nthe Program are deemed satisfactory. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to the officials \nof the Government during program processing. \n \n1.  Procurement and Disbursement \n \n50.  The loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange costs (excluding \nlocal duties and taxes) of items produced and procured in ADB member countries, excluding \nineligible items and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources. In accordance \nwith  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related \nRequirements for Program Loans, the reimbursement procedure will be used to disburse the \nloan  proceeds  based  on  certification  provided  by  the  Borrower.  No  supporting  import \ndocumentation will be required, if during each year loan proceeds are expected to be disbursed, \nthe value of the Republic of the Philippines\u2019 total imports minus imports from nonmember \ncountries, ineligible imports, and imports financed under other official development assistance is \nequal to or greater than the amount of the loan expected to be disbursed during such year (see \nAppendix 5). The Government will certify its compliance with this formula with each withdrawal \nrequest. Otherwise, import documentation under existing procedures will be required. ADB \nreserves  the  right  to  audit  the  use  of  loan  proceeds  and  to  verify  the  accuracy  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s certification.   \n \n2.  Counterpart Funds \n \n51.  The counterpart funds to be generated out of the loan proceeds will be used to finance \nthe associated structural adjustment costs and activities consistent with the MDP, and the \ndevelopment of a sustainable and diverse, market-oriented microfinance sector with expanded \noutreach of a wider range of services at competitive prices for the poor. \n \n3.  Monitoring and Tranching \n \n52.  The program period will be 24 months. The loan will be released in two tranches. The \nfirst tranche of $75 million will be made available upon the Government meeting conditions of \nloan effectiveness. The second tranche of $75 million is expected to be released within 24 \nmonths of loan effectiveness. The progress of implementation of specified policy actions set out \nin the policy matrix (Appendix 3) will be reviewed by ADB with the Government on an ongoing \nbasis. \n \n                                                 \n30 ADB. 2005.

The objective of the TA is to (i) promote financial literacy and assist the Government in \ndeveloping a national financial literacy program for the poor and users of microfinance services; \n(ii) build viable MFIs that can provide efficient and cost effective retail delivery of services to the \npoor; and (iii) establish a consumer protection framework to reduce vulnerability of the poor to \nillegal and unsound practices. To achieve these objectives, the TA will focus on: \n \n(i)  promoting  financial  literacy  and  assisting  NAPC,  in  collaboration  with  other \nconcerned agencies and departments, local government units, and microfinance \ntraining institutions, in the development of a national financial literacy program, \nincluding gender education and consumer protection for the poor and users of \nmicrofinance  services;  developing  model(s)  for  sound  microinsurance  and \nsavings/  micro-investment  practices  in  consonance  with  existing  laws  and \nregulation; and preparing guidelines and business development services models \nfor MFIs; \n \n(ii)  increasing the efficiency of MFIs through (a) development of training modules on \nthe uniform set of MFI performance standards to promote adoption by MFIs, and \nto provide effective tools for training regulators, MFI management, microfinance \nwholesalers  of  funds,  and  rating  agencies;  (b)  design  of  software  for  the \nmicrofinance sector for monitoring performance and assessing MFI compliance \nto the performance standards; and (c) MFI training on performance standards. \n \n(iii)  formulating  a  privatization  plan  and  options  for  PPSB,  and  preparing  an \nassessment and valuation of PPSB for DOF\u2019s Privatization and Management \nOffice  and  PPSB  Board  of  Directors  with  a  view  to  bringing  in  strategic \ninvestment for an accelerated outreach of savings and remittance services in \nrural and remote areas; and \n \n(iv)  establishing  a  free  public  access  website  to  support  consumer  protection, \nincluding a public service section to assist the poor in making inquiries and filing \nconsumer  complaints  on  MFIs  not  in  compliance  with  Philippine  law  and \nregulation, and issuance of a consumer protection guidebook for the poor and \nusers of microfinance. \n \n54.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $715,000  equivalent,  comprising  $157,000  as  foreign \nexchange equivalent and $558,000 as local currency. The Government had requested ADB to \nfinance $500,000 equivalent to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and $343,000 equivalent \nof the local currency cost.  The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund \n(JSF), funded by the Government of Japan. The Government will provide $215,000 equivalent \nto finance counterpart staff and office facilities. The Executing Agency, DOF, will oversee and \ncoordinate  the  TA,  and  provide  the  necessary  counterpart  staff  and  office  space  for  the \nconsultants. A senior official will be appointed to serve as the TA Project Manager. The TA will \nbe implemented over a 22-month period and is planned to commence by March 2006 and be \ncompleted  by  December  2007.  Consulting  services  will  include:  (i)  six  person-months  of \ninternational consultants with expertise in MFI training and development, software design and \ndevelopment, financial valuation of corporations and financial institutions, and privatization in \nthe financial sector; and (ii) 46 person-months of domestic consultants with expertise in the \nmicrofinance sector\u23afincluding laws, regulations, practices, services, and products offered by all \ntypes  of  MFIs,  financial  literary  program  development  and  training,  website  design  and \n ", "  21\ndevelopment, consumer protection, and information services for the poor. A firm will be selected \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic consultants. The quality and cost-based \nselection  (QCBS)  method  and  simplified  technical  proposals  will  be  used  for  consultant \nselection. The cost estimates and financing plan and detailed terms of reference for consultants \nare provided in Appendixes 7 and 8, respectively. \n \n55.  In parallel with the preparation of the MDP, an associated project is being developed, \nDeveloping  Financial  Cooperatives,  for  possible  financing  by  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty \nReduction (JFPR) in the amount of $900,000, subject to the approval of the Government of \nJapan. This project is designed to develop monitoring and regulatory capacities of CDA and \nprovide capacity building of the savings and credit cooperatives sector over 2005\u20132008 for \nefficient and sound operations. Under the proposed project, the operations and performance of \ncredit and savings cooperatives would be strengthened through training of cooperative officers \nand trainers, including performance standards and international best practices, conducted by \ncooperative federations accredited by CDA. Inspectors will also receive training on supervision \nand examination techniques, and the performance monitoring capacities of CDA would be \nimproved by the installation of an advanced registration and management information system. A \ndraft proposal summary is attached as Appendix 9. \n \n \nV.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Benefits and Impact on Poverty \n \n56.  The Program will provide significant benefits and will have positive impacts on the poor. \nThe Program will support the Government in achieving the MDGs, including eradicating extreme \npoverty  and  hunger  and  the  promotion  of  gender  equality  and  empowerment  of  women. \nPreliminary estimates of potential impact of some measures are shown in Table 2.  \n \n57.  The Program supports the Government\u2019s vision of a financial sector that fosters broad-\nbased,  sustainable  economic  growth,  reduces  poverty  and  contributes  to  macroeconomic \nstability. The program will support a sustainable, diverse, market-oriented microfinance sector, \nwith expanded outreach of services at competitive prices to the poor. The greater outreach of \nmicrofinance  services  with  lower  costs  to  the  poor  will  increase  livelihood  and  income-\ngenerating  activities,  that  will  in  turn  result  in  increased  investment,  job  creation,  and  tax \nrevenues to the Government.  \n \n58.  The poor will benefit from improved efficiencies and performance of service providers \nthat can provide more cost-effective retail delivery of services on a sustainable basis. Sustained \naccess  to  microfinance  services  will  enable  the  poor  to  build  viable  businesses,  pursue \neconomic  opportunities  and  income-generating  activities,  and  reduce  their  vulnerability  to \nshocks and contingencies. Microenterprises will be able to expand, benefiting owners and their \nfamilies directly and the broader economy indirectly through increased economic activity.      \n \n59.  The removal of regulatory impediments to competition and barriers to expansion by \nfinancially sound and well-managed microfinance institutions will result in a more robust and \ncompetitive environment that will increase the outreach of MFIs and the range of available \nservices, and lower the cost of services to the poor. The poor will benefit from the introduction of \ntruth-in-lending to all types of MFIs for full disclosure of costs of borrowing and transparency in \ntransactions. \n ", "22  \n \n60.  Microfinance  providers,  clients  and  the  poor  will  benefit  from  an  enabling  and \ntransparent  regulatory  and  supervisory  regime,  with  stronger  regulatory  bodies  capable  of \neffective oversight to ensure protection of poor people\u2019s money and sound MFI operations. \nGreater transparency and certainty will also encourage investment. The commercialization of \nthe microfinance sector will stimulate investment in the sector, bringing strategic resources and \ntechnology for the management of MFIs.  \n \n61.  Remittance services for the poor, including in rural areas, will be expanded, and lower \ncost transfer of remittances via cell phone based technology will be facilitated through the \ndevelopment of a supporting regulatory framework. Transfer of OFW remittances directly into \nMFI  deposit  accounts  will  eliminate  the  costly  middleman  fees  common  in  current  tie-up \narrangements. Lowering the cost of transfers and payments is important, especially for poor \nfamilies. Remittances from OFWs can also play a significant role in mobilizing the necessary \nsavings for increased outreach and sustainability of MFI operations. If MFIs can capture only \n15% of the informal remittance flows currently believed to be outside the formal banking system, \nthat would translate into $1.3 billion. Even If only 10% of that amount is retained as savings after \nconsumption, significant capital will be mobilized in this sector.   \n     \n62.  The poor will be empowered and will benefit from a national financial literacy program \nthat  will  increase  awareness  and  understanding  on  basic  concepts  and  importance  of \nmicrofinance and other forms of financial intermediation, and on managing financial resources, \nboth in the household and local economy. Business development services for the poor will also \nbe expanded to help the poor develop livelihood activities and expand their microenterprises. \nConsumer protection will be strengthened to reduce vulnerability of the poor and users of \nmicrofinance services to illegal and unsound practices, and a free public access website will \nsupport consumer protection and facilitate inquiries and filing of complaints.  \n \nB.  Social and Environmental Safeguards \n \n63.  No  impacts  related  to  ADB\u2019s  environment  and  resettlement  policies  are  anticipated \nunder  this  loan.  Indigenous  peoples  will  be  targeted  through  the  Government\u2019s  KALAHI \nprogram, which seeks to reduce poverty throughout the country. Monitoring of KALAHI has \nshown that some indigenous peoples are relatively difficult to involve in the program, so special \ninitiatives are being planned so they can be reached more effectively. These initiatives will \npertain to KALAHI-facilitated activities under the MDP as well.  In addition, the MDP will ensure \nthat outreach to potential beneficiaries, and training programs for borrowers and savers (in \nfinancial literacy, gender, and consumer protection) and for staff of MFIs be made accessible to \nindigenous peoples. This may require delivery of courses in remote locations and in local \nlanguages. See Supplementary Appendixes D and E.  \n \n64.  A summary poverty reduction and social strategy is included in Appendix 4. \n \n ", "  23\n \nTable 2: Preliminary Estimates of Potential Impact from Selected Measures for the Poor \n \nLower Cost of Borrowing to the Poor: \n \n\u2022  Increasing competition in microfinance to lower cost of borrowing for the poor: \nEstimate for reduction in annual interest rates in   \na competitive market (based on data on current      20% to 30% (or more) \nMFI operations) \n   \n\u2022  Mobilizing savings to lower the cost of MFI funds and the cost of borrowing for the poor: \nAnnual cost of funds to MFIs from major GFIs    13% \nCurrent estimated annual cost to MFIs for funds    5% \nfrom savings deposits  ---------- \nDifference/potential savings that could be passed    8% \nto borrowers in reduced interest rate \n   \nNominal annual interest rates currently range from 24%-60%, however effective annual interest \nrates, taking into account other charges and fees, can result in rates that are twice the quoted \nrate. On a combined basis, the total annual savings in interest costs for the poor from increasing \ncompetition and from mobilizing savings could range from $17million to $45 million per year \ncalculated using an initial principal loan amount of P2,000 to, P4,000 and assuming 2.1 million \nclients. With a larger MFI client base, the  annual savings to the poor would be higher.  \n   \nLower Cost of Transfer of Remittances: \n \nBased on current cost estimates, families receiving remittances from OFWs utilizing cell-phone based \ntechnologies could save : \nEstimated savings per transaction (may be                $20  \nhigher)      \n   \nEstimated savings per year per worker   $240 \nassuming 12 transactions (may be higher)                               or P13,416 \n  (at exchange rate of P55.90 = $1.00) \n \nCalculating assuming MFIs capture 10% of the estimated $8.6 billion remittances believed to flow \nthrough informal channels, and assuming an average monthly remittance amount of $300, this \nwould translate into 2.87 million transactions per year.  At $20 savings per transaction, this would \ntranslate into potential savings to the poor of $57.4 million per year.   \n   \nIncreased Income-Generating and Employment Opportunities for the Poor: \n   \n      There are currently 17 million poor people who lack access to microfinance services. Universal \naccess  to  microfinance  services  could  mean  self-employment  for  17  million  people,  or  self-\nemployment for a majority, some of whom would also employ others. Preliminary field data show that \nsome microfinance clients who progressed to the third cycle of borrowing, and also received BDS \nsupport to strengthen management and/or operations, were able to expand business and hire 2-3 \npeople. \n \n \nIncreased Productivity of MFI Clients and MFI Staff: \nTransfers and payments using cell phone based technology can not only reduce the direct cost of \ntransactions, but can significantly reduce the indirect costs associated with these transactions. Clients \nliving in remote areas may walk up to four hours each way to an MFI/representative to make a \npayment, resulting in the loss of one days productive work. For MFI staff, the time savings and impact \non productivity would also be significant.  \n   \nSources:  ADB estimates; Globe Telecom; Mindanao Capital Corporation; and National Anti-Poverty Commission. \n \n ", "24  \n \n \nC.  Risks \n \n65.  Implementation of the Program could be affected by a number of factors. \n  \n(i)  The principal risk stems from resistance by vested interests groups to reforms, \nincluding measures for increased transparency, disclosure and competition. Such \nresistance can be overcome through the Government\u2019s continued commitment to \npoverty reduction and the development of microfinance and microenterprises as \nembodied in the Social Reform and Poverty Alleviation Act and the MTDP, 2004-\n2010. \n \n(ii)  There may also be delays because of political instability or social unrest, and lack \nof capacity to implement reforms in a timely manner. \n \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n \n66.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)   The Government will promptly adopt and implement the policies and program \nactions indicated in the MDP as specified in the Development Policy Letter, \nincluding the Policy Matrix, in a timely manner and shall ensure that such policies \nand actions will continue in effect during and after the MDP. \n \n(ii)  The Government will actively assist and support ongoing program monitoring and \nevaluation  by  facilitating  consultations  with  related  agencies  and  other  key \nstakeholders as appropriate. \n \n(iii)  The  Government  will  ensure  an  equitable  opportunity  among  women  and \nindigenous peoples in activities conducted under the MDP, including initiatives in \noutreach  and  training,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Gender  and \nDevelopment and Policy on Indigenous Peoples.   \n \n(iv)  The Government will provide ADB with an opportunity to comment on relevant \nstudies and draft laws or decrees that are likely to impact on program objectives \nand implementation. \n \n(v)  The Government will ensure that adequate and timely funds are made available \nto the DOF and the relevant agencies to facilitate implementation of the program. \n \n \n ", "  25\nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n67.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nADB, and recommend that the Board approve the loan of $150,000,000 to the Republic of the \nPhilippines for the Microfinance Development Program from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, \nwith interest to be determined in accordance with ADB's LIBOR-based lending facility, a term of \n15 years, including a grace period of 5 years, and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Program Loan Agreement presented \nto the Board. \n \n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda   \nPresident \n \n \n \n28 October 2005 \n \n ", " 26  Appendix 1 \nSECTOR ANALYSIS \n \n1.  Various microfinance services are provided in the Philippines by banks, cooperatives, and \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs), including 184 banks1 (rural, thrift and cooperative banks), \nabout 500 NGOs, and 4,579 savings and credit cooperatives. Many other types of registered \ncooperatives also provide some form of financial services. In addition, an increasing number of \nfinancial institutions are engaging in microfinance, while informal and unregulated institutions are \nmoving toward formalization. MFI NGOs have played an important role in providing services in \nhard-to-reach areas where the private sector has not entered and where there is less information \non the markets and potential clients. The number of active borrowers from banks engaged in \nmicrofinance was reported by BSP at 549,348 as of December 2004. NAPC reports show total \nborrowers at 2.1 million, including bank clients, as of June 2005 based on information reported by \ngovernment financial institutions engaged in wholesale lending to microfinance institutions.  \n \n2.  Although the Philippines has achieved significant progress in promoting microfinance, more \nthan two-thirds of poor households, or 17 million people, still do not have access to microfinance \nservices.2  Instead, the poor rely heavily on self-finance or informal sources that may be very \ncostly, limiting their ability to participate in and benefit from development opportunities and income-\ngenerating activities. The limited outreach of microfinance services is reported in the National Anti-\nPoverty  Commission  (NAPC)  2004  report,  Status  of  Microfinance  Outreach  in  60  Poorest \nProvinces, which details outreach, potential number of client households, and saturation level of \nmicrofinance services in each area.  Access to microfinance services can help the poor build viable \nbusinesses,  pursue  economic  opportunities  and  income-generating  activities,  and  reduce \nvulnerability to external shocks or contingencies. Microfinance is the central strategy for poverty \nreduction in the Philippines under Republic Act 8425 Social Reform and Poverty Alleviation Act, \nand is an important part of the Medium Term Philippines Development Plan (MTDP) 2004-2010.   \nHowever,  despite  Government  commitment  and  development  of  the  sector  to  date,  further \nmeasures are required to meet popular demand, achieve Government\u2019s goal of universal access \noriginally targeted for 2005, and address systemic weaknesses in the sector.  \n \n3.   Microfinance encompasses a range of services including savings deposits, loans, payment \nservices, money transfers, remittances, and insurance. Historically, microfinance has concentrated \non microcredit designed for high-turnover microenterprises. In practice, however, it was found that \nclients also adapted the loans for a variety of purposes such as medical expenses, funerals, and \nschool fees in addition to funding livelihood activities. Microfinance is also important for land \nacquisition,  housing  construction,  purchase  of  animals,  consumer  durables  and  other  items. \nBangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) regulations3 specify that the maximum principal amount of a \nmicrofinance loan shall not exceed P150,000, however loans are often in the amount of  P4,000 \nand below. Interest rates in the market are high, and it is not uncommon to see rates of 60% or \nmore  per  annum.  High  rates  of  interest  could  be  reduced  through  competitive  pricing  and \nincreased efficiencies to lower cost of borrowing to the poor. MFI clients are broadly the poor and \nlow-income households and their microenterprises,4 however more than 90% of borrowers to date \nhave been women. Who controls the funds once received, and how these are managed within the \nhousehold  unit  are  areas  for  further  examination.    The  MFI  clients  typically  lack  assets  for \n                                                 \n1  BSP data as of 31 December 2004. \n2  Source: NAPC.

The demand for savings services is considered as strong as or \nstronger than the demand for credit, and going forward an expansion of the outreach of savings \nservices will be essential to achieve institutional sustainability and poverty reduction.  \n \nTable A1.1: Providers of Microfinance in the Philippines \n \nMain \nLegal  Regulated  Supervised  Authorized  Target \nType  Ownership  Funding \nBasis  by  By  Activities  Market \nSources \n             \nFormal Institutions             \n               \nThrift Banks  Private  Thrift Banks  BSP, PDIC  BSP, PDIC  Equity,  Savings  General \nInvestors  Act, Law on  commercial  deposits and  public \nCorporations  loans,  loans \ndeposits \n               \nRural Banks  Private  Rural Banks  BSP, PDIC  BSP, PDIC  Equity,  Savings  General \nInvestors  Act, law on  commercial  deposits and  public \ncorporations  loans,  loans \ndeposits \n               \nPawnshops  Private  General  BSP, SEC  None  Equity,  Pawn loans  General \nInvestors  banking law  commercial  public \nloans \n               \nLending  Private  General  SEC  None  Equity,  Loans  General \nInvestors  Investors  banking law,  commercial  public \nlaw on  loans \ncorporations \n               \nSemiformal Institutions             \n             \n(Savings and  Individual  Cooperatives  CDA  None  Capital plus  Saving  Members \nCredit)  members  code  member  deposits and \nCooperatives  deposits  loan to \nmembers \n               \nNGOs  Private  Law on  Annual  None  Grants,  Loans to  General \ntrustees  trusts and  reports to  donations,  individuals  public \nnonprofit  SEC and  commercial  and groups \nfoundations  BSP  loans \n               \nBSP = Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, CDA = Cooperative Development Authority, NGO = nongovernment organization, \nPDIC \u2013 Philippine Deposit Insurance Commission, SEC = Securities and Exchange Commission. \nSource: ADB. 2003.

Foreign investment is currently limited to 60% of thrift banks under the Thrift Banks Act of \n1995, and no foreign ownership of rural banks is allowed under the Rural Banks Act of 1992. The \nrationale in allowing foreign ownership for the thrift banks had been the larger capital requirements \nfor that sector. There is an option under the General Banking Law of 2000, whereby the Monetary \nBoard may authorize a foreign bank to acquire up to 100% of the voting stock of one Philippine \nbank only.

People\u2019s Credit and Finance Corporation (PCFC) \n1.  The  People\u2019s  Credit  and  Finance  Corporation  (PCFC)  is  a  government-owned  finance \ncompany  registered  at  the  Securities  Exchange  Commission  (SEC)  in  1997  as  part  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s social reform agenda. It is supervised by Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) and has \na capital of P1 billion, comprising preferred shares of P900 million and common shares of P100 \nmillion, wholly owned by the National Livelihood Support Fund, a national fund supervised by LBP. \nLBP submits reports to BSP regularly. It is audited by the Commission on Audit. The PCFC board \nmembers are appointed by the President of the Philippines. \n2.  PCFC provides wholesale funds to about 200 MFIs for onlending to poor clients. Its current \nlending rate for an investment credit loan (up to 7 years) is 12% per annum, with a 1% front-end \nservice charge. Its lending rate for an institutional development loan (up to 4 years) is 3% per \nannum with 1% front-end service charge. Its loan portfolio, which is exclusively for microfinance, \namounted to P2.55 billion as of June 2004. \n3.  PCFC has 96 employees, including 38 account officers in charge of its accredited MFI \naccounts. Its head office is in Makati and it has no field office. As of the end of 2003, PCFC had \ntotal resources of P2.87 billion, a loan portfolio of P2.46 billion, a net worth of P1.15 billion, total \nliabilities of P1.65 billion (including an ADB and International Fund for Agricultural Development \n[IFAD] loan of P1.35 billion), and a net income of P53 million. It reported a past due rate on loans of \n1.55%. \n2.  Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) \n4.  LBP was created under the Agrarian Reform Law of 1963. Its major mandate is to provide \nfinancial support for the acquisition of lands by tenant farmers under the Government\u2019s land reform \nprogram.  In  addition  to  regular  commercial  banking,  LBP  conducts  program  lending  to  agri-\nbusinesses through rural financial institutions, primarily rural banks and cooperatives. LBP is a \ngovernment-owned  financial  institution  with  a  universal  banking  license.  It  is  under  the \nadministrative supervision of the Department of Finance (DOF). As a bank, it is under the regulatory \nsupervision of BSP. LBP is audited by the Commission on Audit. \n5.  LBP is a borrower from the ADB and IFAD loan referred to above (para. 4) and loans from \nthe World Bank for relending to PCFC in its wholesale microfinance operations. LBP\u2019s lending to \nPCFC amounted to P1.62 billion as of the end of 2003.  LBP has not lent directly to retail MFIs until \nrecently. However, it is widely known that some LBP branches have lent to rural banks and \ncooperatives under a different loan window, effectively financing their microfinance operations. The \nlending rate to MFIs is 12% per annum with a front-end charge of 1% (up to 5 years). In 2002 LBP \nstarted microfinance operations on a pilot basis, accrediting 12 MFIs working with its regional \noperations after the enactment of the Barangay Microenterprise and Business Enterprises Act (RA \n9178) in 2002. \n6.  As of the end of 2003, LBP had P268 billion in total resources, a loan portfolio of P120 \nbillion, net worth of P22 billion, and an annual net income of P2.0 billion. Its nonperforming loan  \nratio was 14.71%, against the industry average of 15.77%. LBP has 340 branches and field units \nand a network of 1,500 countryside financial institutions. \n \n \n                                                 \n1  Sources: People\u2019s Credit and Finance Corporation; Land Bank of the Philippines; Development Bank of the Philippines; \nand Small Business Guarantee and Finance Corporation.  \n ", " 32  Appendix 1 \n3.  Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) \n7.  The Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) is a development bank mandated to cater \nmainly to small and medium enterprises (SMEs). In the late 1950s, the Rehabilitation and Finance \nCorporation (which had helped finance reconstruction and rehabilitation in the period following the \nSecond World War) was renamed the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP). DBP is a \ngovernment-owned  financial  institution  with  a  universal  banking  license.  It  is  under  the \nadministrative supervision of DOF and under the regulatory supervision of BSP. DBP is audited by \nthe Commission on Audit. \n8.  DBP  was  given  a  mandate  to  undertake  microfinance  operation  only  recently  by  the \nBarangay  Microenterprise  and  Business  Enterprises  Act  in  2002.  Under  its  wholesale  lending \noperations, DBP has allocated P500 million for lending to retail MFIs. As of the end of 2003, its \nmicrofinance loan portfolio was only P36 million. DBP\u2019s sources for its funds for wholesale lending \nto its accredited retail financial institutions, including MFIs, are facilities funded by ADB, KfW, \nUSAID, and the World Bank. Lending rates are 10% per annum for loans up to 15 years under the \nADB Development of Poor Urban Communities Sector Project (DPUSP), 7.7% per annum up to 15 \nyears under the KfW facility, and 8.7% per annum up to 12 years under the Industrial Guarantee \nand Loan Fund (IGLF) funded by ADB, the World Bank and USAID. JBIC funds the Industrial and \nSupport Services Expansion Program (ISSEP II), part of which has been extended to PCFC and the \nSmall Business Guarantee and Finance Corporation (SBGFC).  \n9.  As of the end of 2003, DBP had total resources of P149 billion, a loan portfolio of P68 billion, \na net worth of P19 billion, and a net income of P1.9 billion. The nonperforming loan ratio was \n10.84%. DBP operates with 77 branches nationwide. It links with commercial banks, thrift banks \nand rural banks for its wholesale lending programs. Its main clients are SMEs, most of which are \nengaged in manufacturing and agricultural processing. \n4.  Small Business Guarantee and Finance Corporation (SBGFC) \n10.  The  Small  Business  Guarantee  and  Finance  Corporation  (SBGFC)  is  a  government \ncorporation established in 1991 under the Magna Carta for Small Enterprises (RA 6977), to provide \nGovernment support to SMEs. It provides wholesale lending, direct lending, and credit guarantee \nservices to the SME sector. In 2001, SBGFC merged with the Guarantee Fund for Small and \nMedium Enterprises, a guarantee fund operated by the Livelihood Corporation and attached to the \nOffice of the President. Subscribed and paid-up capital as of the end of 2003 amounted to P1.8 \nbillion, contributed by five government financial institutions (GFIs) and the national Government. \n11.  SBGFC, having been created by an act of Congress, is not registered with the Securities \nand Exchange Commission and is not under its supervision or regulation. However, as it is an \naffiliate of three commercial banks, SBGFC is audited by the Commission on Audit and examined \nby BSP. It is under the direct supervision of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI). The \nBarangay Microenterprise and Business Enterprises Act of 2002 mandated SBGFC to undertake \nmicrofinance operations. Its microfinance loan portfolio through 12 cooperatives amounted to P40 \nmillion as of the end of 2003. Its lending rates to MFIs are the same as those under the SME \nUnified Lending Opportunities for National Growth (SULONG) program, which are revised quarterly. \nThe current rates are: 9.5% per annum for up to 1 year; 13.8% per annum for 1-3 years; and 14.5% \nper annum for 3-5 years. \n12.  As of the end of 2003, SBGFC had total resources of P2.6 billion, a loan portfolio of P1.4 \nbillion, net worth of P2.0 billion, and a net income for the year of P42 million. The nonperforming \nloan  ratio  of  SBGFC\u2019s  wholesale  lending  facilities  as  of  December  2003  was  14.35%.  The \naggregate nonperforming loan ratio of direct loans was 15.95%. SBGFC has a head office in Makati \nCity, Metro Manila, one branch each in the Visayas and Mindanao, and two representative offices in \nLuzon.  \n ", "  Appendix 2  33 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign Summary  Performance Targets  Monitoring Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions: \nImproved household  \u2022 Increased outreach and  \u2022 Reports from the  \u2022 Government commit-\nincomes and reduced  access of the poor to  National Anti-Poverty  ment to policy and \npoverty and vulnerability of  sustainable microfinance  Commission (NAPC);  institutional reforms \nthe poor to shocks   services as measured by  Microfinance Council of \n\u2022 Macroeconomic stability \nConsultative Group to  the Philippines (MCPI), \n\u2022 Active participation of \nAssist the Poor (CGAP)  National Credit Council \nthe private sector and \ndepth of outreach tools  (NCC); Cooperative \nthe poor \nand guidelines  Development Authority \n(CDA) and other  \u2022 Effective social \n\u2022 Increased investment in \nconcerned agencies  mobilization of the poor \nincome-generating \nand active participation  \nactivities and micro-  \u2022 National statistics and \nenterprises  economic and  \u2022 Effective and timely \nconsumptions surveys  implementation of \n\u2022 Improvement in \nreforms \neconomic lives of poor  \u2022 Programs reviews \n\u2022 Satisfactory fiscal \n\u2022 ADB post-evaluation \nmanagement and \nreport \nmacroeconomic stability \nRisks: \n\u2022 Delays in \nimplementation of \nreforms \n\u2022 Insufficient mobilization \nof the poor \nOutcome      Assumptions: \nA sustainable and diverse,  \u2022 Microfinance institution  \u2022 Reports NAPC, MCPI,  \u2022 Government commit-\nmarket-oriented  (MFI) outreach  NCC, CDA, and other  ment to policy and \nmicrofinance sector with  indicators including  concerned agencies  institutional reforms \nexpanded outreach of  increase in active \n\u2022 Formally adopted or  \u2022 Macroeconomic stability \nservices at competitive  number of microfinance \nissued policies, \nprices to the poor    clients; and increase in  \u2022 Active participation of \nregulations, and \nthe private sector and \n  number of transactions  amended laws  \nthe poor  \nin 2005-2007 and \n\u2022 MFI audit reports \nbeyond from 2004  \u2022 Effective and timely \nbaseline level  \u2022 DOF monitoring and  implementation of \nreporting on fulfillment of  reforms \n\u2022 MFI sustainability \nindicators show  policy actions  Risks: \nimprovement1 in 2005- \u2022 Progress reporting by  \u2022 Delays in \n2007 and beyond from  ADB missions  implementation of \n2004 baseline level \n\u2022 Consultants\u2019 reports  reforms \n\u2022 Financial services \n\u2022 ADB post-evaluation  \u2022 Lack of qualified trainers \nprovided other than \nreport  or institutes for large \ncredit  (e.g. savings, \nscale capacity building \nmicroinsurance services, \nand training \nand remittances) \n\u2022 Increase in savings to \nGDP ratio and savings \nmobilization in MFIs \nOutputs      Assumptions: \n1.

Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy \n \nA.  Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nIs the sector identified as a  Is the sector identified as a national \n Yes   Yes \nnational   priority in country poverty partnership \npriority in country poverty   No  agreement?   No \nanalysis? \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in the Philippines: \n \nMicrofinance is recognized as the central strategy for poverty reduction in the Philippines under Republic \nAct 8425 Social Reform and Poverty Alleviation Act passed in 1997. It is also an important part of \nPresident  Arroyo\u2019s  10-point  agenda  which  calls  for  the  creation  of  10  million  new  jobs,  and  the \nPhilippine\u2019s Medium Term Development Plan (MTDP) 2004-2010 which includes microfinance as a main \nstrategy and proven effective tool in alleviating poverty. The G-8 Action Plan for poverty reduction \nincludes expanding access to microfinance for entrepreneurs1 and working with the Consultative Group to \nAssist the Poor (CGAP)2 to promote best practices in microfinance for developing countries. Ensuring \npermanent access to institutional financial services for poor and low-income households at competitive \nprices is a goal of ADB\u2019s Microfinance Development Strategy3, and microfinance is a priority in the \nPhilippines Country and Strategy Program (CSP) 2005-2007. \n \nMicrofinance  clients  are  broadly  the  poor  and  low-income  households  and  their  microenterprises. \nMicrofinance encompasses a range of services including savings deposits, loans, payment services, \nmoney  transfers,  and  insurance.  Access  to  microfinance  services  can  help  the  poor  build  viable \nbusinesses, pursue economic opportunities and income-generating activities, and reduce vulnerability to \nexternal shocks or contingencies. Improved access and efficient provision of services can enable the poor \nto smoothen their consumption, manage their risks better, build assets, develop microenterprises, and \nenhance their income-earning capacity.  \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                       Proposed Classification: Targeted intervention \n \nThe Government reported in the Medium Term Development Plan (MTDP) 2004-2010 that poverty \nincidence worsened to 34 % in 2000 from 33 % in 1997 and the number of poor individuals increased \nfrom 23.95 million in 1997 to 26.54 million in 2000. With population growing at 2.36% per year in the \nPhilippines, heavy burdens will be placed on the social and physical infrastructure and environment with a \nprojected annual addition of 1.6 million people. Without corrective action to rebalance population growth \nagainst the limited resources, prospects are limited for moving out of poverty the 40% of Filipinos \ncurrently living on $2 or less a day. Even with no change in population, \u201caccess poverty\u201d is a major \nproblem in the Philippines. Poverty is manifested in low incomes and in exclusion, including poor access \nto services which keeps the poor vulnerable. Income poverty in the Philippines is a dynamic phenomenon \nwith people moving in and out of poverty over time. A survey designed to gauge chronic and transient \npoverty found that over a 3-year period about one fifth of the surveyed households were chronically poor, \nwhereas almost one third of the households moved in and out of poverty over the period. 4  \n \nPoverty incidence in terms of families in the 60 poorest provinces, and the status of microfinance \noutreach is included in Appendix 1, Table A1.1.  \n \n                                                 \n1  June 2004 statement on the G-8 Action Plan, Applying the Power of Entrepreneurship to the Eradication of Poverty.  \n2  The Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP) was formally established in 1995 with bilateral and multilateral \nfunding agencies, including ADB, to expand poor people\u2019s access to quality financial services from sustainable or \npotentially sustainable MFIs.

Yes    No \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes    No \n \nParticipation of stakeholders will be facilitated through the Government\u2019s KALAHI (Kapit Bisig Laban Sa \nKahirapan) program for poverty reduction, which solicits active participation of basic sector organizations, \nother civil society organizations and the business sector in its poverty reduction programs and activities. \nThis multi-stakeholder and interagency convergence policy is applied in all NAPC poverty reduction \ninitiatives.  \n \nThe basic sectors defined under RA 8425 are farmer-peasants and landless rural workers; artisanal \nfisherfolk; workers in the formal sector and migrant workers; workers in the informal sector; indigenous \npeoples and cultural communities; women; persons with disabilities; senior citizens; victims of calamities \nand disasters; youth and students; children and urban poor.  \n \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nTo date, more than 90% of borrowers in the microfinance sector have been women. Who controls the \nfunds  once  received,  how  the  funds  are  managed  within  the  household  unit,  who  controls  the \nmicroenterprises and income generated are all areas that need further examination in determining the full \nimpacts and potential benefits for women. The National Anti-Poverty Commission (NAPC) has taken a \nproactive role in furthering gender education for women in the Philippines, and launched an initial Gender \nIn Microfinance Training Seminar in 2005 to address some of these issues. The strategy under the \nMicrofinance Development Program (MDP) is to combine the gender training with the planned national \nfinancial literacy program to attain maximum outreach and education.       \n \nHas an output been prepared?     Yes    No \n \nInitial Gender in Microfinance training seminar materials have been developed by NAPC. These materials \nwill be further developed for application and dissemination with the national financial literacy program. \n \n \n ", "54  Appendix 4 \nE.

Grant Development Objective(s) and Expected Key Performance Indicators \nGrant Development Objectives (GDO): The ADB Philippine Country Strategy and Program (CSP) 2005\u2013\n2007 identifies development of microfinance as one of the key strategies for more rapid poverty reduction. \nMicrofinance is recognized as the central strategy for poverty reduction in the Philippines under Republic \nAct 8425 Social Reform and Poverty Alleviation Act. Ensuring permanent access to institutional financial \nservices for poor and low-income households at competitive prices is also a goal of ADB\u2019s Microfinance \nDevelopment Strategy. ADB is currently formulating the Philippine Microfinance Development Program, \nwhich aims at developing sustainable Philippine microfinance industry in line with the CSP.

The Project aims to promote healthy development of the sustainable \nmicrofinance  industry  in  the  Philippines  to  increase  household  incomes,  reduce  poverty  and  reduce \nvulnerability of the poor to shocks by improving performance of financial cooperatives through capacity \nbuilding and strengthening their compliance with CDA\u2019s regulatory requirement and operating efficiencies. \n \nThe Project comprises the following 2 components: \n\u2022  The operations of savings and credit cooperatives will be strengthened by training sessions conducted \nby cooperative federations accredited by CDA, which will standardize the training module on sound \nmicrofinance operations based on the international best practices. (Component A). \n\u2022  The  performance  monitoring  capacities  of  CDA  will  be  improved  by  the  installation  of  advanced \nregistration/management information system (Component B). \nExpected Key Performance Indicators (maximum 5 indicators): \n\u2022  Improve and standardize the training module on cooperative microfinance operations \n\u2022  Disseminate the CDA performance standards to financial cooperatives \n\u2022  Increase training sessions to cooperatives, cooperative trainers, and CDA inspectors \n\u2022  Increase cooperative compliance with CDA performance standard requirement \n \nIII.
