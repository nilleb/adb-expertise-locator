THE ENSUING PROJECT \n \n1.  Seventy-five percent of Kazakhstan\u2019s urban infrastructure needs replacement and/or \nrehabilitation. An estimated $2.8 billion is needed for water supply improvements and $1.3 billion \nfor sewage treatment in 28 cities, $2.0 billion for solid waste management, $3.0 billion for urban \ntransport, and up to $8.0 billion for integrated investments covering district heating, energy \nefficiency  and  housing  improvement  measures.1 To  put  these  amounts  in  perspective, \nKazakhstan\u2019s gross domestic product in 2016 was equivalent to about $133.0 billion, a substantial \nreduction from the high of about $224.0 billion in 2013.2 Overall, annual investment requirements \nprojected to total of at least $20.0 billion are required for promoting economic diversification and \nenvironmentally sustainable and inclusive growth aligned with the government\u2019s Strategic Plan \nfor Development of Kazakhstan 2025: Technological Modernization for Accelerated Growth and \nBetter Quality of Life.3 The government prefers to avoid sovereign borrowing given their current \nfinancial constraints, but its own funding for infrastructure investment is only about Tenge 90.0 \nbillion in 2016 from both the government\u2019s budget subsidies and investments. Private sector \nparticipation is limited due to a weak enabling environment i.e. policy, legal, institutional, and \nfinancial frameworks; weak technical and operational efficiency and financial management of \nmunicipalities and utilities; as well as the lack of a pipeline of bankable projects. \n \n2.  The proposed Kazakhstan Urban Infrastructure Modernization Program and Finance \n \nFacility (the Project) is a medium to long-term roadmap to ensure sustainable development and \nfinancing of urban infrastructure operationalized through a national level facility \u2014 Kazakhstan \nUrban Infrastructure Financing Facility (KUIFF).4 KUIFF will be designed to help the government \nto more effectively utilize its funds by addressing specific systemic weaknesses identified through \nthe Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) earlier policy advisory and research engagements with \nthe government. Some of these weaknesses are at an overarching national level e.g. lack of \ncapital markets instruments to make long-term local currency (tenge) funding available to utilities \nfor capital expenditures, short-term budgeting plans, and inefficiencies in tariff setting. Some are \nlocal level such as weak corporate financial management and operational inefficiency of individual \nutility companies. Specifically, KUIFF will comprise a: \n(i)  technical  unit  to  (a)  develop  sustainable  business  model(s)  with  effective \noperations and maintenance and financial management of urban utility companies \nto  improve  creditworthiness,  corporate  governance,  and  asset  management;  \n(b) establish criterion for screening projects and parameters for implementation \nincluding  safeguards  through  environmental  and  social  management  system;  \n(c)  recommend systemic policy, regulatory, and institutional reforms, including \ntariff setting and regulation, and framework to enabler private sector participation; \n(d) improve the capacity of local administrations to appraise, develop, and manage \nurban  projects  with  trainings  for  the  technical,  institutional,  and  financial \nmanagement; and (e) structure and implement bankable projects.  \n(ii)  financing unit to (a) raise sovereign long-term finance from ADB, World Bank, and \nother development partners; and (b) blend these sovereign funds and deploy them \nto lower overall financing cost of projects including project structuring costs, crowd-\nin private funds as well as technological and managerial efficiencies including \n                                                \n1   ADB. 2017.

Strategic Plan for Development of Kazakhstan 2025: Technological Modernization \nfor Accelerated Growth and Better Quality of Life. Astana. \n4  Project presented to the government on 29 October 2017 during a joint ADB-WB Mission; included in Country \nOperations Business Plan 2018 -2020 for 2019 Board consideration as Urban Water Supply and Sanitation Project. \n ", "2 \n \nthrough private public partnerships, and provide lower cost finance for the riskiest \nperiod (pre-construction) of projects to make projects financially bankable. \n \n3.  Overall, the blended finance approach of KUIFF enables: (i) projects and utilities to be \nmore financially sustainable and therefore directly meet all financing costs including sovereign \ngovernment obligations; and (ii) ADB\u2019s long-term, low interest (sovereign) funds to leverage \nprivate sector finance. The transaction technical assistance (TRTA) is included in the country \noperations business plan, 2018\u20132020, for Kazakhstan for urban water supply and sanitation and \nis  proposed  as  a  larger  urban  infrastructure  modernization  program  in  response  to  the \ngovernment\u2019s request for ADB support to the urban sector.5 The total project cost is estimated at \n$560 million equivalent, of which $250 million will be financed by ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources \nas a project loan, $250 million will be financed by the World Bank as cofinancing, and $60 million \n(12% of total project cost) will be financed by the government toward taxes and duties, land \nacquisition and resettlement costs, as required. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n4.  The TRTA will help the government to design the project including: (i) conceptually \ndesigning the KUIFF; (ii) identifying urgent urban infrastructure and services projects for sovereign \nfunding and at least three demonstration projects for private sector participation and undertaking \npreliminary technical, financial, economic, social, and environmental due diligence of these \nprojects; (iii) identifying and designing the key policy, institutional, legal, and financial measures \nfor enabling private sector participation; and (iv) developing a medium-term capacity development \nplan for government staff. TRTA consultants will prepare the project to ensure that the ensuing \nloan complies with ADB and government requirements.6 \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n5.  Output 1: Kazakhstan Urban Infrastructure Modernization Program (KUIMP) and \nKUIFF  designed.  This  output  will  design  the:  (i)  KUIMP,  as  a  roadmap  for  urban  sector \ndevelopment, and (ii) KUIFF, as a technical support and financing facility to operationalize the \nKUIMP. Specifically, the output will develop the institutional and governance structure and the \noperational guidelines for KUIMP\u2019s financing and technical support units, including selection \ncriteria for projects. It will assess the suitability of the financial intermediary (FI) modality for the \nproject and accordingly conduct financial due diligence of KUIFF (and relevant government \nfinancial institutions). It will also design a robust financial management system including internal \ncontrol (s) for KUIFF to ensure effective and efficient deployment of funds in line with qualifying \ncriteria established for projects and to facilitate accurate, detailed and timely project accounting, \nauditing and reporting. The output will explore the possibility of KUIFF creating investible long-\ndated debt securities attractive to long-term liability holders such as the Unified National Pension \nFund and functioning as a performance-based long-term lender to utilities. \n \n6.  Output 2: Demonstration projects identified and developed. This output will review \nthe existing public investment pipeline of local governments to identify demonstration projects, \nundertake preliminary technical, financial, economic, legal, institutional, social and environmental \ndue diligence of five to six projects, and prepare project briefs to develop a pipeline. The criteria \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2017. Country Operations Business Plan: Kazakhstan, 2018\u20132020. Manila. \n6  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 17 November 2017. \n ", "3 \nprepared under output 1 will be used to select two to three demonstration projects for KUIFF\u2019s \ntechnical support unit. The types of projects to be prepared will be two-fold: (i) bankable projects \nfor blended financing; and (ii) urgent local urban infrastructure investments through sovereign \nfinancing. A technical support unit team comprising international and national experts including \nrelevant staff from designated ministries and local government will be formed to: (i) undertake \nprefeasibility  studies  for  the  identified  demonstration  projects;  (ii)  prepare  tender  and  bid \ndocuments; and (iii) provide management support services to help improve operations and \nmaintenance,  and  financial  management  of  utilities.  This  output  is  to  help  kick-start  the \ndevelopment  and  financing  of  Kazakhstan\u2019s  municipal  infrastructure  rehabilitation  and \ndevelopment with simple and conventional projects backed by feasible financing plans, and to \nslowly and steadily build a track record of successful smaller projects before launching major \nprojects.   \n \n7.  Output 3: Key policy, institutional, legal, regulatory, and financial measures for \nimproved  private  sector  participation  identified.  This  output  will  identify  the  systemic \nconstraints i.e. policy, institutional, legal and regulatory, and financial frameworks, that are \nimpeding the sustainable financing and delivery of urban infrastructure and services, including \nthrough private sector participation. Based on the constraints identified, it will propose key \nmeasures both at the national and local level that are critical to further developing and or \nstrengthening key elements of these enabling frameworks. \n \n8.  Output  4:  Medium-term  capacity  development  plan  developed.  This  output  will \ndevelop a medium- to long-term capacity development plan with a set of coordinated and highly-\ntargeted technical assistance activities. These would be used to build sustainable professional \ncapacity in key institutions of the Government of Kazakhstan to support them in performing their \nfunctions related to the KUIFF, including project identification, screening, preparation, appraisal \nand evaluation, and implementation. All relevant organizations at national level would be covered, \ntogether with Akimat-level entities in oblasts and cities whose utility companies will qualify for \ntechnical support and financing under KUIFF. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n9.  The technical assistance (TA) is estimated to cost $1,100,000 equivalent, of which \n$1,000,000 equivalent will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special \nFund (TASF-Others) and 10% of the TA cost will be financed by the Government of Kazakhstan \nfor in-kind contribution. The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 1. The government will \nprovide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff,  office  space,  office  supplies, \nsecretarial assistance, domestic transportation, and other in-kind contributions. The government \nwas informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project.   \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n10.
