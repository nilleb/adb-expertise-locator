INTRODUCTION \n1.  During  the  2010  country  programming  mission,  the  Government  of  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for technical assistance \n(TA) in financial management. The PRC country partnership strategy for 2008\u20132010, under the \n\u201cinclusive  growth  and  balanced  development\u201d  pillar,  emphasizes  the  strengthening  of \ngovernance  in  public  resource  management  to  improve  central  and  provincial  government \nfinances and help develop the poorer, western provinces.1 A TA fact-finding mission on 3\u20139 \nMay 2011 discussed in detail the objectives, scope, implementation arrangements, costs, and \nterms of reference of the TA with the Ministry of Finance (MOF). This report reflects ADB\u2019s \nfindings  and  the  understanding  reached  with  the  government  on  the  TA.  The  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2  \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The PRC has developed rapidly in the last 30 years. Its economy grew by more than 9% \nyearly on average and became more decentralized, market based, and integrated with the world \neconomy.  The  government  budget  and  financial  management  systems  are  increasingly \nimportant  in  such  core  functions  as  supporting  economic  growth  and  stability,  resource \nallocation for national goals, delivery of critical public services, and protection of the vulnerable \nin society. \nA.  Fiscal Policy for Emergency Management \n3.  The  PRC  is  among  the  countries  most  affected  by  natural  disasters.  There  are \nestablished fiscal policies for emergency management,3 but research and further improvements \nare  needed.  Current  emergency  management  objectives  and  interventions  emphasize \nimmediate  disaster  response  and  post-disaster  restoration  and  reconstruction.  Too  little \nattention is placed on prevention through stronger infrastructure, institutions, and capacity. In \naddition, (i) emergency management activities and funding are fragmented among the different \nministries  and  levels  of  government  and  are  ineffective;  (ii) fiscal  policy  instruments  for \nemergency management (expenditure, revenue, and transfer policy) are limited; (iii) budget \nmanagement and monitoring of emergency funds are inadequate; (iv) laws and regulations \ngoverning fiscal policy for emergency management are incomplete; and (v) emergency-related \nasset use and compensation policy lack a clear legal and institutional basis. \nB.  Management of the Social Insurance Fund  \n4.  While the social security system is complex with different schemes and inadequate \ncoverage of the population, in particular the rural poor and migrants, the total amount of social \ninsurance funds (SIFs) has expanded rapidly and reached an estimated CNY2 trillion at the end \nof 2010.4 But social insurance management and service delivery is devolved, fragmented, and \nlargely municipality based. The Social Insurance Law was passed by the National People\u2019s \nCongress  in  October 2010  and  took  effect  on  1  July  2011.  Its  implementation,  including \n                                                      \n1  ADB. 2008. Country Partnership Strategy: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2008\u20132010. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of the ADB website on 10 June 2011. \n3  Emergency management, or disaster management, is the organization and management of resources, roles, and \nresponsibilities for dealing with all aspects of emergencies, including preparedness, response, and rehabilitation.  \n4  The social insurance system in the PRC comprises pension, health, unemployment, maternity, and work injury \ninsurance.  \n ", "2   \nconsequent revisions in regulations and guidelines, and the rapid growth of the SIF require \nbetter management at the various levels.  \n \n5.  A nationwide budget for SIF was compiled for the first time in 2010 on a 3-year trial basis. \nImplementation  has,  however,  been  significantly  hampered  by  the  highly  decentralized \nadministration of the SIF. Financial and accounting regulations for SIF, issued in 1999, demand \nrevision. The management of individual accounts and investments is not transparent and varies \nwidely and unevenly among the tiers of government. The SIF accounting system is cash based. \nRelationships between provincial and local level social insurance agencies need to be clarified; \nin  particular,  policy  making  functions  must  be  separated  from  account  management  and \npayment services. \n \n6.  SIFs are invested at the various levels of government with inadequate coordination. \nInvestments are restricted to bank deposits and government bonds, which offer inadequate \nprotection  against  inflation.  There  is  a  lack  a  consolidated  social  insurance  database  and \nwell-developed  information  system  for  sharing  information  vertically  (between  levels  of \ngovernment) and horizontally (between ministries) for better coordination of social insurance \nschemes \nC.  Development of the Local Government Bond Markets  \n7.  Since 1995, the Budget Law has barred local governments from borrowing or issuing \nbonds without State Council approval. As a result, infrastructure investments are often funded \nwith revenues from land leases and with indirect off-budget borrowings, through public utility \ncompanies,  special-purpose  vehicles,  and  urban  development  investment  corporations. \nGranting local governments direct access to the bond market promises significant benefits. \nLocal governments will gain access to more resources for infrastructure development and be \nexposed in the process to market discipline and reporting requirements. Fiscal transparency \nand good governance will thereby strengthen. Expanding local government borrowing will also \nhelp deepen the financial markets.                                                                                                                     \nD.  The Leading Accounting Talent Project \n8.  Progress in putting in place the institutional framework for accounting, auditing, and \ncorporate financial reporting in the PRC has been impressive. But the financial management \nprofession needs further strengthening. New accounting professionals lack practical exposure to \napplying latest accounting standards. In particular, few leading accountants have the high-\nquality international qualifications and experience and the senior management skills needed to \ncope with the demands of an increasingly open and advanced economy. The PRC had about 10 \nmillion accountants at the end of 2009; of these, only 2% were senior accountants. \n \n9.  In 2010, MOF developed a talent development plan for the accounting industry for 2010\u2013\n2020. It was the first long-term national development plan for accounting professionals. As \ncalled for in the plan, the government is sponsoring the Leading Accounting Talent Project \n(LATP)  in  order  to  develop  qualified  accountants  capable  of  meeting  the  challenges  of \ninternationalization in accounting and reporting practices. MOF launched the LATP in 2005 to \nbring the total number of leading accountants in the PRC  to 2,000 by 2020. The training \nprovided  under  the  plan  is  centered  on  applicable  accounting  and  auditing  standards, \nprofessional challenges and values, and international dimensions of accounting and auditing in \nthe corporate setting, in the public sector, and in the academe. Since 2005, 700 candidates \nhave been identified and trained under the LATP and 50 of those have graduated. At the same \n ", "  3 \ntime, the demand for leading accountants has risen as the PRC economy has internationalized \nand confronted the effects of the international financial crisis. \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The expected impact of the project is increased fiscal effectiveness in national and \nsubnational governments, and its expected outcome is deepened financial management reform \nat both levels of government. ADB is currently implementing four TA projects related to fiscal \npolicy and public finance reforms in the PRC.5 This TA will supplement the current TA programs \nby addressing a wider range of key public finance and financial management reform issues.  \n \n11.  Related  interventions  by  other  development  partners  include  World  Bank  projects \ninvolving (i) advisory analytical work in pension reform and rural and urban social insurance; \nand (ii) infrastructure and institutional reforms for the development of the local government bond \nmarkets, in cooperation with the budget department of MOF.  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The outputs of the TA will consist of the following: (i) a fiscal policy framework for \nemergency management, (ii) a study on the reform of SIF management, (iii) a study on the \ndevelopment of local government bond markets, and (iv) support for the LATP. The fiscal policy \nand bond market studies will be published as knowledge products in the form of policy and \ntechnical notes to guide researchers and senior policy and decision makers. \n \n13.  Output 1: Fiscal policy framework for emergency management. A holistic fiscal \npolicy framework for emergency management based on good international practice will be \ndeveloped. An overall report and sub-reports on the following key areas will be prepared:  \n \n(i)  Infrastructure, institutions, and capacity building for emergency management. \nResearch  will  deal  mainly  with  (a) the  distribution  of  emergency  management \nresponsibilities  among ministries,  levels  of government,  and  agencies;  (b) early \nwarning systems; (c) emergency storage and reserve systems; (d) technology for \nemergency management; and (e) capacity building. \n(ii)  Fiscal  policy  instruments  and  public  financial  management  systems  for \nemergency management. Research will pertain to (a) stable revenue mobilization; \n(b) budget  and  public  finance  management  procedures  (budget  preparation, \nexecution,  monitoring,  procurement,  performance  management,  and  auditing); \n(c) expenditure  and  transfer  payment  policy;  and  (d) the  integration  and \nstrengthening of the related laws and regulations.  \n(iii)  Emergency-related  asset  use  and  compensation  policy.  The  policy  will  be \ngrounded in clear legal and institutional arrangements. \n                                                      \n5  ADB. 2008.

Output  2:  Study  on  the  reform  of  Social  Insurance  Fund  management.  Four \ninterrelated key issues of SIF management reform under MOF will be studied in depth, in \nrelation to international good practice: \n \n(i)  Strengthening  of  social  insurance  budget  management.  The  method  of \ncompiling a consolidated budget for SIF will be improved, and relevant regulations \nand guidelines prepared. A consolidated budget will tighten fund supervision at the \nvarious levels of government and establish a sound basis for central government \nsubsidies and efficient fund investments. A consolidated budget, once published, \nwill also increase the transparency of SIF operations. \n(ii)  Revision of financial regulations. The management of individual accounts and \ninvestment  must  be  standardized  and  made  more  transparent.  Financial \ntransactions must involve a wider range of banks which cover rural areas. Interest \nrates on deposits must be standardized and the SIF must move toward an accrual \nsystem  of  accounting.  Relationships  between  social  insurance  agencies  in  the \nprovinces must be clarified.  \n(iii)  Improvement of investment strategy and systems. The investment of social \ninsurance funds must be coordinated and unified across government. A nationwide \nframework  for  investment,  including  risk  management,  financial  control  and \nsupervision, and governance structures, and a wide variety of financial instruments \nmust be developed. \n(iv)  Expansion  of  computerized  management  information  systems  (MISs).  A \nnationwide computerized administration system with greater vertical and horizontal \nconnectivity will (a) allow the establishment of a social insurance database with \ninformation about beneficiary accounts at central, provincial, and county levels; \n(b) reduce the risk of fraud and overlapping benefits; (c) promote the coordination \nof social insurance schemes and increase the transparency of individual account \nmanagement;  (d) provide  data  to  improve  the  monitoring  of  SIF  performance; \n(e) make it easier for the central government to supervise account management \nand investment; and (f) facilitate the portability of pension rights.  \n \n15.  Output 3: Study on the development of local government bond markets. Operating \nmechanisms, institutions, and the transition to a nationwide system of local government bond \nmarkets will be studied. The research will be based on international good practice and the \nexperience of different provinces in the PRC, and will include a survey of the literature on the \nlocal government bond markets in three developed countries. Five provinces, representing the \nvarious  geographic  regions  of  the  PRC  (eastern,  central,  southwestern,  northeast,  and \nnorthwestern), will be selected for an examination of the preconditions for the setting up of local \ngovernment  bond markets  in  different  provinces.  A team  of treasury department  staff  and \ndesignated consultants will make field visits to consult with local financial bureaus and financial \ninstitutions. The case studies will support pilot bond issues by the provinces in line with the \ncurrent agenda of the treasury department.  \n \n16.  The research will expand recent studies led by the budget department of MOF on the \nfiscal concerns connected with the issue of local government bonds by paying closer attention \nto the related core responsibilities of the treasury department and local finance bureaus. Those \ncore  responsibilities  include  investor  relations,  bond  structure  and  yield  curve,  debt \nmanagement, risk management, market liquidity, primary and secondary market development, \ninformation disclosure, and rating.  \n \n ", "  5 \n17.  Output 4: Support for the Leading Accounting Talent Project. A mid-term review of \nthe LATP will be carried out and the overall framework for capacity building under that project \nwill be revised. Research on two selected accounting management areas, i.e., internal control \nsystems and financial and accounting methods for international acquisitions, will be conducted, \nbased on case studies on selected companies. A model will be developed for the adoption of \nthe internal control regulations and implementing guidelines that were issued in 2008 and 2010. \nThe  case  studies  will  provide  benchmarks for the  proper  use  of  accounting  standards for \ninternational  acquisitions,  which  now  poses  a  major  challenge  to  state-owned  and  private \nenterprises in the PRC.  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1.4 million. At the government\u2019s request, ADB \nwill finance $1.2 million with a grant from its Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF\u2013other \nsources) and the government will cover $0.2 million in local currency costs in kind, comprising \noffice accommodation, counterpart staff, and other related services. Detailed cost estimates are \nin Appendix 2. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  The International Department of MOF will be the executing agency. Various other MOF \ndepartments will be the implementing agencies\u2014the Department of Economic Construction for \nthe  fiscal  policy  framework  for  emergency  management  (output 1);  the  Social  Security \nDepartment for the study on SIF management reform (output 2); the Treasury Department for \nthe  study  on  local  government  bond  market  development  (output 3);  and  the  Accounting \nRegulatory  Department  for  support  for  the  LATP  (output 4).  A  team  of  four  international \nconsultants (6 person-months) and 15 national experts (99 person-months) will be hired. The \nTA activities are expected to start in November 2011 and end in December 2013. \n \n20.  The  International  Department  of  MOF,  as  executing  agency,  will  supervise  the \nday-to-day work of the consultants, in consultation with the implementing agencies. The national \nconsultants  will  be  hired  through  firms.  As  no  single  firm  can  be  expected  to  provide \nwell-qualified consultants for the entire TA project, given the diversity of the outputs, the national \nconsultants are to come from several firms. The firms will be recruited through quality- and \ncost-based selection at a quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20. If no suitable firms can provide the required \nnational consultants, making quality-and cost-based selection inapplicable, the consultants may \nbe  hired  individually,  subject  to  the  appropriate  ADB  approval  process.  The  international \nconsultants will be hired individually. ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as \namended from time to time) will be used in the hiring of all the TA consultants. The TA proceeds \nwill be disbursed according to the Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as \namended from time to time). \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,200,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  Public  Finance  and  Financial \nManagement Reforms, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n     \n  Performance Targets  Data Sources and   \nDesign Summary  and Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nIncreased fiscal  Local government bonds  National and subnational  Government is committed to \neffectiveness in national  issued by seven pilot  government budget  PFM reforms.  \nand subnational  provinces by 2015  reports    \ngovernments      Risk \n  Government policy  Renewed macroeconomic and \nannouncements  financial instability may create \n  pressure to postpone priority \nBond tender  PFM reforms.  \nadvertisements in China \nDaily \nOutcome      Assumption \nDeepened financial  Improved fiscal policy  Government policy  Government is committed to \nmanagement reform in  framework for  announcements  PFM reforms.  \nnational and subnational  emergency management   \ngovernments   prepared by 2013   \n \nImproved framework for \nSocial Insurance Fund \nmanagement prepared \nby 2013 \n \nFramework for smooth \ntransition to systems for \nlocal government bond \nissues prepared by 2013 \n \nImproved capacity-\nbuilding framework for \nLATP prepared by 2013 \nOutputs       Assumptions \n1.
