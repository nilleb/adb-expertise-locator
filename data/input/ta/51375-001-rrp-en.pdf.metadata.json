THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nIndia for the Public\u2013Private Partnership in Madhya Pradesh Road Sector Project. \n \n2.  The  proposed  project  will  improve  transport  connectivity  in  Madhya  Pradesh  by \nrehabilitating and upgrading about 1,600 kilometers (km) of newly declared state highways and \nsingle-lane major district roads (MDRs) to two-lane widths. The project will be implemented under \na hybrid\u2013annuity model (HAM), which is a form of public\u2013private partnership (PPP). This will be \nthe first HAM project by the executing agency and will pave the way for increased investment in \ntransport by mobilizing private sector participation.1 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Madhya Pradesh is the second largest state in the country with an area of about 308,000 \nsquare km and is the fifth most populous with a population of 73 million.2 Agriculture is the \nmainstay of the state, with 72% of the population living in rural areas. From 2011 to 2018, the \nstate\u2019s economy grew by an average of 8% because of various industrial developments and policy \nmeasures, such as the development of industrial nodes on the Delhi\u2013Mumbai Industrial Corridor, \nand other industrial areas and growth centers.3 Despite recent economic growth, Madhya Pradesh \nis still among the poorer states in the country with per capita income (at constant prices) at about \n63% of the national average and about 32% of the state\u2019s population living below the poverty \nline.4 The state\u2019s large size, dependence on agriculture, and distributed industrial development \nmake transport infrastructure, particularly roads, a critical necessity. \n \n4.  Road infrastructure in Madhya Pradesh. As of 2018, the state had a road network of \nabout 63,637 km. About 7,806 km are national highways, 11,060 km are state highways, 22,412 \nkm are MDRs, and the balance are other district roads and village roads.5 The current road \ncapacity is unable to cope with the increasing vehicle ownership with the number of registered \nvehicles growing at an average annual rate of 10.3% since 2006 to reach 11.14 million in 2016.6 \nSome areas are also subject to frequent flooding during monsoons, which accelerates road \nsurface deterioration, limits access to goods and services, and compromises road safety. \n \n5.  Road sector strategy. The Government of Madhya Pradesh (GOMP), in its road sector \nmaster plan for 2013\u20132033, envisions connecting all regional and district headquarters by two-\nlane roads, and connecting all villages by all-weather roads.7 This is aligned to the agenda of the \nGovernment of India to develop states\u2019 road networks to enhance connectivity, road safety, and \n \n1  ADB. 2017. Country Operations Business Plan: India, 2019\u20132021. Manila. The project was listed in the country \noperations business plan as Madhya Pradesh Roads Project VI but was renamed to indicate the modality. \n2  Government of India. Open Government Data Platform India (accessed 8 April 2019). \n3  The Government of Madhya Pradesh (GOMP) has identified seven industry growth centers at Bhopal, Gwalior, \nIndore, Jabalpur, Rewa, Sagar, and Ujjain. There are 19 industrial development parks, 129 industrial areas, 8 \nintegrated development centers, and other industrial zones being developed around these city clusters (Sources: \nGOMP, Department of Industry Policy and Investment Promotion; and India Brand Equity Foundation). \n4  Reserve Bank of India. 2019.

Bhopal. \n \n ", "2 \nquality.8 State highways and MDRs form key links between rural roads and national highways and \nare critical for rural and peri-urban connectivity. Developing this road network by increasing \ncapacity and constructing all-weather roads will improve road conditions and safety and will foster \ninclusiveness by enabling better access to markets and basic services. To create a more efficient \nroad network and to better link national and state highways to towns and rural areas, the GOMP \nintends to rehabilitate and upgrade these roads to two-lane roads. \n \n6.  Previous ADB loans to the Government of Madhya Pradesh. Since 2002, the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) has provided the GOMP with five loans to develop its road network.9 \nIn these prior loans, about 7,300 km of roads were developed, which represents only 11% of the \ntotal road length in the state. Through an ADB technical assistance, the Madhya Pradesh Road \nDevelopment Corporation (MPRDC) was established and has become a leading organization of \nits type in the country. Previous projects not only built the MPRDC\u2019s institutional capacity in \nexecuting roads projects but have also initiated an accident response system and pilot-testing of \nan accident insurance scheme. This project extends experience from previous projects, related \nto procurement and performance-based maintenance contracts, to PPP arrangements through \nthe HAM to bring private sector efficiencies for sustainable asset creation and maintenance. \n \n7.  Use of the hybrid\u2013annuity model. The model was introduced by the Government of India \nin 2016 to revive private sector investments in road projects since PPP participation, in the form \nof toll-based concessions, decreased from 6,144 km in 2011 to 209 km in 2018.10 The HAM is a \nmix of engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) and build\u2013operate\u2013transfer (BOT). \nUnder EPC, the government pays contractors to build roads with design and implementation risks. \nUnder  the  BOT  model,  private  contractors  or  concessionaires  build,  finance,  operate,  and \nmaintain the road and receive fixed payments from the government during the concession period. \nFor this project under HAM, the government will release 60% of the total project cost during \nconstruction, which will be paid to the concessionaire in tranches linked to completion milestones. \nThe remaining 40% is arranged by the concessionaire, usually 20%\u201325% in the form of equity \nand the rest as commercial debt. Once the project is completed, the government will repay the \nconcessionaire\u2019s financial investment and operation and maintenance costs, in fixed semi-annual \npayments over the next 10 years. This project is designed to minimize land acquisition, and the \nuse of HAM passes design, implementation, and operation and maintenance (O&M) obligations \nto the private sector, while bringing in a modicum of private sector financing. The project will be \nthe MPRDC\u2019s first HAM project. ADB is implementing two loans with HAM contracts in Rajasthan \nand Karnataka. Two of three HAM contracts of Rajasthan State Highway Investment Program are \ncompleted, and contracts under Karnataka State Highways Improvement III Project recently \nachieved financial closure.11 \n \n8.  Alignment with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030. The project is consistent with the following \noperational priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030: (i) reducing poverty and inequality, (ii) accelerating \nprogress in gender equality, (iii) tackling climate change, and (iv) promoting rural development.12 \nThe project is also consistent with the strategic pillar of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for \nIndia, 2018\u20132022 on providing inclusive access to infrastructure networks and services, and in \n \n8  National Institution for Transforming India Aayog. 2018.

Value added by ADB assistance. ADB assistance to the project will add value by: \n(i)  Increasing private sector involvement. The project seeks to continue ADB\u2019s \nengagement with the state\u2019s road sector by assisting the MPRDC in private sector \nfinancing through its first HAM project to leverage government financing and \nimprove the sustainability of capital investments. \n(ii)  Developing an e-maintenance asset management system. The project will \ndevelop an e-maintenance asset management system for state highways and \nMDRs, with software that can record the location, type(s) of defect, or maintenance \nrequired. The system will include an online module on the MPRDC\u2019s website so \nthe public can inform the MPRDC of road defects for necessary action. This system \nwill enable closer monitoring of road infrastructure and timely repairs. \n(iii)  Increasing public\u2013private partnership knowledge and hybrid\u2013annuity model \nimplementation skills of the executing agency. The project will strengthen the \ninstitutional  capacity  of  the  MPRDC  engineers,  consultants,  and  contractors \nthrough training on HAM implementation, PPP investment, and project financing \noptions. The gender action plan includes capacity and institutional strengthening \nof  private  partners  toward  sustained  gender  parity  in  human  resources  and \noperations to help promote and sustain institutional gender policies and practices. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The project is aligned with the following impact: mobility and connectivity in India improved \n(footnote 8). The project will have the following outcome: road transport efficiency and safety in \nMadhya Pradesh improved.14 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n11.  Output 1: State highways upgraded to two-lane and all-weather roads. At least 750 \nkm of state highways will be upgraded to two-lane and all-weather standards with road safety and \nelderly, women, children, disabled-friendly features. \n \n12.  Output 2: Single-lane major district roads upgraded to two-lane and all-weather \nroads. At least 850 km of MDRs upgraded to two-lane and all-weather standards with road safety \nand elderly, women, children, disabled-friendly features. \n \n13.  Output  3:  Capacity  for  hybrid\u2013annuity  model  implementation,  and  road  asset \nmaintenance and management improved. An e-maintenance system for state highways and \nMDRs will be developed. A training program to develop the MPRDC\u2019s capacity on HAM contract \nimplementation and project financing options will be conducted. \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n14.  The project is estimated to cost $904 million, including a 10-year O&M obligation during \nthe concession period (Table 1). \n \n13 ADB. 2017.

Such amount does not represent an excessive share of the project cost. The \namount of taxes and duties to be financed by ADB (i) are within the reasonable threshold identified during the country \npartnership strategy preparation process, (ii) represent only 7.6% of the investment plan, and (iii) apply only to ADB-\nfinanced expenditures.

Commitment charges for the ordinary capital resources loan are 0.15% per \nyear to be charged to the undisbursed loan amount. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \n15.  The government has requested a regular loan of $490 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period \nof 5 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other \nterms and conditions in the draft loan and project agreements. Based on the straight-line method, \nthe average maturity is 15.25 years, and maturity premium payable to ADB is 0.10% per year.15 \n \n16.  Modality. The sector lending modality is the most suitable modality for the project because \n(i) the project will finance small subprojects, i.e., state highways and MDRs throughout the state; \n(ii) Madhya Pradesh has a sector development plan in place (footnote 7); (iii) the MPRDC has the \nrequisite institutional capacity to implement the sector development plan and prepare individual \nroad packages; and (iv) the MPRDC has substantive experience in the procurement of contractors \nand implementation of ADB loans.16 The roads selected in this project are based on (i) sector \ndevelopment plan priorities, (ii) development priorities of the government, and (iii) readiness to \nimplement.  Under  the  sector  loan,  approval  of  non-sample  subprojects  will  be  based  on \nsatisfactory  technical,  economic,  social,  and  environmental  assessment  compliance,  with \neligibility criteria agreed between the MPRDC and ADB, and based on the criteria set for the \nsample roads. The selection criteria for subprojects are described in Appendix 6 of the project \nadministration manual (PAM).17 The MPRDC is preparing to upgrade 800 km of newly declared \nMDRs using the HAM contract model and has indicated that it may propose these to ADB for \nadditional financing in subsequent years. \n \n \n15 The government will confirm the loan tenure and repayment period. \n16 Footnote 7; ADB.

The summary financing plan is in Table 2. ADB will provide $490 million from its ordinary \ncapital resources to finance part of the civil works and consulting services during construction, \nincluding recurrent costs and taxes, as relevant. As the concessionaire will only be paid 60% of \nthe project cost during construction, private sector investment is required to cover the remaining \nconstruction cost and O&M obligation. The government will provide $128 million to implement the \nproject and cover annuity payments over the life of the contract. ADB funding will only cover the \nconstruction period.

The executing agency for the project will be the GOMP, acting through the MPRDC. The \nMPRDC was set up through ADB technical assistance, initially as a project management unit for \nADB projects.19 The MPRDC is an empowered agency with the chief minister of Madhya Pradesh \nas the chairperson and senior government functionaries on its board. While the MPRDC is the \nimplementing agency for multilateral loans, it has also pioneered a toll-based BOT approach to \nimprove and maintain roads, where such tolling is feasible. \n \n20.  The MPRDC will engage construction supervision consultants as independent engineers \nfor the works contracts. Procurement, including consulting services, to be financed by ADB will \nfollow the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement \nRegulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). The project will be \nimplemented over 4.5 years, beginning in December 2019.

The analysis was conducted using the Highway Development \nand Management Model and life cycle costs that compared with- and without-project scenarios \nusing a 9% discount rate and the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) as decision criteria \nfollowing ADB guidelines.20 The EIRRs for the individual sample roads range from 12.6% to \n21.8%, and their aggregation provides 17.4%, indicating that the overall project is economically \nfeasible for implementation. This is further affirmed by the sensitivity analysis given adverse \nchanges in costs and benefits. The EIRRs remain above 9% in all cases, individually and \naggregately, demonstrating the robustness of the overall project\u2019s economic feasibility. \n \n23.  Financial sustainability. The project will not generate revenue. HAM, contracts awarded \nunder the project will include a 10-year O&M obligation. After the initial 10-year O&M period, the \nMPRDC will maintain the state highways while the Madhya Pradesh Public Works Department \nwill maintain the MDRs. Both agencies have maintenance manuals in place and have historically \n \n20 ADB. 2017. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n ", "7 \nbeen allocated adequate road maintenance funds. Furthermore, the project\u2019s incremental impact \non the total state road network\u2019s maintenance needs is estimated to be very small. Further, \nassurances will be sought from the Government of India and the GOMP that adequate funds for \nannuities and maintenance will be provided. To enhance the capacity of both agencies to improve \nand maintain the assigned road network in the medium and long term, the project will finance the \ndevelopment of an e-maintenance system for state highways and MDRs as well as a training \nprogram to develop the capacity of the MPRDC and contractors on HAM implementation. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n24.  Institutional capacity. The MPRDC was incorporated in 2004 under the Companies Act \nof 1956 and is a wholly owned company of the GOMP. It is familiar with ADB procedures, having \nimplemented previous ADB loans, and has strong institutional capacity for ADB and PPP projects. \nThe MPRDC is headquartered in Bhopal and has divisional offices across the state. \n \n25.  Financial  management.  Financial  management  assessment  of  the  MPRDC  was \nconducted following ADB\u2019s financial management and due diligence guidelines.21 It covered fund \nflow  arrangements,  staffing,  budgeting,  accounting  and  financial  reporting,  and  audit \narrangements, and found that the MPRDC has an established record in implementing ADB \nprojects and has adequate financial management capacity. The financial management risk is \nmoderate. The assessment noted that for ongoing ADB projects, the most recent audit reports \nwere unqualified and submitted on time. However, the submission of the MPRDC\u2019s audited entity \nfinancial statements for fiscal year 2018 was delayed by more than 6 months compared with \nprevious years; this is an area that needs to be monitored in the future. \n \n26.  As part of the project, the MPRDC will maintain separate books of accounts following \naccounting standards acceptable to ADB. The project financial statements will be audited annually \nby an independent auditor, following auditing standards acceptable to ADB. The MPRDC\u2019s \nfinancial management capacity will be further enhanced by (i) making efforts to retain adequate \nfinance and accounts staff until the end of the project, (ii) enhancing annual and quarterly financial \nreporting, and (iii) providing training to project staff on ADB\u2019s procedures and requirements. \n \n27.  Procurement. The project procurement risk is high. The MPRDC has substantive prior \nexperience with ADB procurement, including large contracts using international advertisement, \nand with the procurement of PPP contracts via BOT and EPC. Contracts for this project have \nbeen bundled into packages to attract qualified contractors, and business opportunity seminars \nhave received good responses from potential bidders. However, since private sector interest and \nfinancing appetite are beyond the MPRDC\u2019s control, the risk after mitigation remains high. \n \n28.  Anticorruption. India\u2019s Prevention of Corruption Act (1988, amended in 2018) was \nenacted to combat corruption in government agencies and public sector businesses. ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the \nGovernment of India and the GOMP. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 16). \n \n \n21 ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila; ADB. 2009.

Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n29.  Improved connectivity and transport infrastructure will impact incomes, livelihoods, and \njobs, resulting in multiplier socioeconomic benefits. In rural areas, improved road infrastructure \nhas influenced women\u2019s participation in gram sabhas and strengthened their participation in local \ndecision-making processes.22 Focus group discussions conducted during the socioeconomic \nsurvey ascertained the inadequacy of the road infrastructure and safety issues that restrict \nwomen\u2019s and girls\u2019 mobility. Infrastructure gaps, such as the lack of adequate lighting, bus \nshelters, and signage, were highlighted. Women were willing to participate in job opportunities \nduring construction and maintenance. \n \n30.  Gender. The project is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. A gender action plan \nhas been prepared to maximize opportunities for women\u2019s participation and benefits from project \nactivities. The project will support (i) infrastructure with features that are friendly to the elderly, \nwomen, children, and people with disabilities; and bus shelters with solar lights;23 (ii) institutional \nstrengthening of public and private sector partners on gender-related aspects, benefits, and \nimpacts of their operations; (iii) women\u2019s economic opportunities; and (iv) women\u2019s greater \nawareness on road safety and government schemes against sexual harassment, exploitation, \nand  abuse  (SHEA).  The  project  will  collect  sex-disaggregated  data  on  staff,  consultants, \ncontractors,  and  project-related  training.  Improved  road  infrastructure  will  provide  reliable \ntransportation facilities promoting safe mobility, reduced time poverty, improved access to health \nand education services, and income-generation opportunities. \n \n31.  HIV and AIDS. Madhya Pradesh has low prevalence and low risk of HIV incidence. \nContractors will carry out HIV and AIDS awareness programs for laborers at work sites, which will \nbe monitored by the independent engineers during project implementation. Awareness camps for \nlaborers at work sites will include a component on SHEA issues, prevention, and mitigation. \nExecuting and implementing agency staff, consultants, and contractors will also be oriented on \nthis. Information related to women-centric schemes at bus stops will include information on SHEA \nand help line numbers. The health camps will educate and raise awareness of community \nmembers (women, children, and adolescents) about SHEA risks, mitigation, and legal rights. \n \n32.  Labor. The bidding documents for the civil works include provisions to (i) ensure that all \napplicable labor laws are complied with, including the prohibition against employing children in \nconstruction; (ii) encourage the employment of poor, affected communities, particularly women; \nand (iii) ensure that wages for men and women are equal for work of equal value. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n33.  In  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (SPS)  (2009),  the  project\u2019s \nsafeguard categories are as follows.24 \n \n34.  Environment (category B). The scope of work includes rehabilitating and upgrading state \nhighways and MDRs. There is adequate right-of-way for all sample subprojects, and impacts are \nlocalized, temporary, and can be easily mitigated. No long-term and irreversible impacts are \n \n22 Gram sabhas comprise representation of persons included in the electoral rolls for the village council.  \n23 A. Bhatt, R. Menon, and A. Khan. 2015. Women's Safety in Public Transport: A Pilot Initiative in Bhopal. Bhopal. The \nstudy pointed to the lack of bus shelters as one of the biggest problems of female commuters. Bus shelter guidelines \ninclude lighting as an important component for women\u2019s safe mobility and public transportation usage. \n24 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n ", "9 \nanticipated. Anticipated impacts, which will mostly be confined to the construction phase, include \nelevated levels of air pollutants, noise, soil erosion, siltation of water bodies, vegetation impacts, \noccupational health and safety impacts, and impacts on the community using and living near the \nroads. Mitigation measures to address environmental impacts have been included in subproject-\nspecific environmental management plans (EMPs), which are included in the bidding documents. \nConsultations  have  been  conducted  with  stakeholders  and  affected  persons  during  project \npreparation, and their concerns have been incorporated in the project design and EMPs. A \ngrievance redress mechanism has been established to continue receiving feedback and any \ncomplaints from affected parties and to address them during construction and operation. \n \n35.  Initial environmental examinations for sample subprojects with EMPs were prepared and \ndisclosed on the ADB website.25 As required for sector projects, an environmental assessment \nand  review  framework  was  prepared  to  provide  guidance  on  the  environmental  safeguard \nrequirements for non-sample roads that will be finalized after project approval. The framework \nsubscribes to both the Government of India\u2019s environmental assessment guidelines and ADB\u2019s \nSPS. No category A subprojects will be financed under the project. \n \n36.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). The project is designed to avoid land acquisition \nand involuntary resettlement by improving roads within the rights-of-way of existing roads. \nStakeholders  and  affected  persons  were  consulted  during  the  preparation  of  the  sample \nsubprojects, project information was disclosed, and eight resettlement plans were prepared in line \nwith the acts and policies of the Government of India and ADB\u2019s SPS. Most impacts are expected \nto be partial or temporary on shops and residential structures encroaching on the rights-of-way. \nOne sample subproject will have the most significant impact, where 33 households (164 persons) \nwill be significantly affected by the loss of greater than 10% of productive assets or structures.26 \nAs required for sector lending, a resettlement framework has been prepared to guide screening \nand  resettlement  planning  for  all  subsequent  subprojects.  If  any  changes,  additional  land \nrequirements,  or  involuntary  resettlement  impacts  are  identified  during  implementation,  a \nresettlement plan will be prepared or updated for ADB approval. \n \n37.  Indigenous peoples (category B). Social impact assessment indicated that for sample \nroads, scheduled tribe households will experience limited involuntary resettlement impacts on \nprivately owned land and structures. The subprojects are not expected to render the scheduled \ntribe  households  vulnerable.  However,  Madhya  Pradesh  is  home  to  46  scheduled  tribes \nrecognized under the constitution, and they comprise about one-fifth of the state\u2019s total population. \nBecause of the potential for non-sample roads to affect scheduled tribe communities, the project \nis classified B. An indigenous peoples\u2019 planning framework  was prepared to guide impact \nscreening, assessment, and mitigation of non-sample subprojects. \n \n38.  No category A subprojects for any safeguard category will be financed under the project. \nThe Environmental and Social Cell of the MPRDC will monitor compliance with all safeguard \nrequirements. At the sites, 12 project implementation units will be assigned to each contract \npackage to manage safeguard issues.27 The independent engineers for the construction contracts \nwill  include  environmental  and  social  safeguard  experts  who  will  support  the  project \nimplementation units. Semiannual monitoring reports will be disclosed on the ADB website. \n \n25 Each initial environmental examination covers roads in the same geographic region and includes non-sample and \nsample roads.  \n26 Rewa\u2013Beeda\u2013Semariya Road\u2013Godha Junction. \n27 Bhopal, Chambai, Chhindwara, Dhar, Gwalior, Indore, Jabalpur, Narmadapuram, Rewa, Sagar, Shahdol, Ujjain. \n \n ", "10 \nF.
