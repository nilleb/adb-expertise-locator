During the 2003 Country Programming Mission, the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) \nrequested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to respond quickly to support policy development \nin a wide range of areas consistent with the PRC Country Strategy and Program (CSP). ADB, \ntherefore, included a technical assistance (TA) project in the 2004 TA pipeline. A Fact-Finding \nMission visited Beijing in  March and April 2004, and reached agreement on  the objectives, \nscope, cost, and implementation arrangements with the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and other \nconcerned government agencies.1 The TA framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The PRC\u2019s specatcular growth over the last 25 years is largely attributable to market \nreforms. The PRC\u2019s experience has demonstrated that a gradual transformation from a centrally \nplanned to a market economy can work. The PRC is one of few countries that has maintained \nrapid economic growth while making that transition.  \n \n3.  The transition has put extraordinary demands on redefining the role of Government, \ndivesting it of direct control of business decision making and changing the policy and regulatory \nenvironment to one appropriate for a modern market economy. Over the past decade the \nGovernment  has  made  considerable  progress  in  developing  an  economic  management \nframework with modern institutions and practices. A series of substantial reforms has improved \npublic administration by reducing the Government\u2019s role; increasing the private sector\u2019s role; \ndecentralizing power; and making use of market forces, price signals, and competition to \nimprove productivity and efficiency. \n \n4.  Despite the substantial progress made, many reforms are needed in the labor, capital, \nand land markets. Needed reforms include improving the business environment; increasing \ncompetition;  strengthening  the  legal,  judicial,  and  regulatory  systems  to  improve  industry \nstandards; improving dissemination of accurate information; enhancing the fiscal and financial \nsectors;  and  improving  corporate  governance.  Policy  improvements  are  needed  in  all \ndimensions of governance\u2014accountability, predictability, transparency, participation. Making \nthe transition from a centrally planned to a market economy means that the private sector must \nplay a bigger role and that the Government must withdraw from areas where the market is more \nefficient. The Government\u2019s role in a market economy is to create a pro-business environment \nso the private sector can thrive; to address market failures such as poverty and environmental \ndegradation;  and  to  provide  public  goods  such  as  health,  education,  social  security,  and \ninfrastructure. This daunting agenda poses many challenges for policymakers.  \n \n5.  As a development partner, ADB played a role in bringing in international experience in \nhelping policy reforms in the PRC.  The objective of  ADB\u2019s CSP is  \u201cto  promote  pro-poor \neconomic growth by enabling greater access of the poor to the benefit of economic prosperity \nand opportunity to achieve it.\u201d The four operational pillars identified by the CSP are  to (i) \npromote pro-poor inclusive economic growth, (ii) build an enabling environment for the private \nsector and strengthen public sector governance, (iii) foster regional cooperation to help integrate \nthe PRC into the global economy, and (iv) promote environmental sustainability. Many policy \nreforms and institutional changes will be required to make progress in these areas. ADB\u2019s ability \nto  successfully  use  knowledge-based  products  to  contribute  to  policy  reform  will  largely \ndetermine ADB\u2019s strategic impact andth e continued relevance of ADB\u2019s PRC operations .\n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 14 February 2004. \n ", " 2   \n \n6.  Promote Pro-Poor Inclusive Economic Growth. The PRC\u2019s Gini coefficient, which \nmeasures income distribution, has reached a high level. The rising inequality reflects differences \namong geographic regions, rural and urban areas, and pockets of urban and rural poverty. This \nhas widened gaps in job, educational, health care, and social security opportunities. Pursuing a \npro-poor inclusive economic  growth agenda will require adoption of many policy reforms to \nimprove the environment for job creation, adoption of pro-poor fiscal reforms, stimulation of rural \ndevelopment, support for social sector development and social security reform, and removal of \ninfrastructure barriers to development in the poor interior regions. \n \n7.  Make Markets Work Better. The economy suffers from financial sector weaknesses, \npoor corporate governance, an incomplete legal and regulatory system, underfunded pensions, \nproblems in the enabling environment for the private sector, lack of transparency and access to \nreliable information, and accounting and auditing weaknesses. To make markets work better, \nthe PRC needs to restructure  the financial sector, promote private sector development, and \nestablish  a  rule-based  legal  and  regulatory  and  institutional  infrastructure.  Improving \ngovernance, developing an enabling environment for the private sector, removing infrastructure \nconstraints to improve the business environment, and supporting financial sector reform and \nsmall and medium-sized enterprise development are key issues. \n \n8.  Foster  Regional  Cooperation.  With  the  PRC\u2019s  accession  to  the  World  Trade \nOrganization  (WTO), globalization impacts pose many policy, legal, and institutional challenges. \nBetter regional cooperation can help the PRC to integrate into the global economy, and other \ncountries to capture  the benefits of  the PRC\u2019s global emergence.  The PRC intends to  bring \ndown policy and institutional barriers to regional cooperation. The PRC also needs to remove \nbarriers to cross-border trade and investment, encourage cross-region private investment, and \nstrengthen regional surveillance and regional financial infrastructure.  \n \n9.  Promote  Environmental  Sustainability.  The  PRC  faces  many  environmental \nchallenges,  including  air,  water,  and  solid  waste  pollution,  and  land  degradation.  The \nenvironmental legal and regulatory frameworks, and enforcement and use of market-based \ninstruments also have weaknesses. Although environmental degradation slowed in the 1990s, \nproblems such as land degradation and desertification  have worsened. The PRC needs to \nstrengthen the environmental legal, policy, and regulatory framework and institutional reform; \nencourage clean-production technologies and renewable  energy; reverse land degradation; \nenhance water resource management; improve management of water and air pollution and of \nsolid waste; and promote private sector and civil-society participation in providing environmental \ninfrastructure and services. \n \n10.   ADB has supported many Government reform initiatives through advisory TAs. While \nmany TAs have  been important  in  formulating  and implementing reform programs,  issues \nrelated to the efficiency and effectiveness of some TAs concern the Government and ADB. An \nADB study, Improving Effectiveness of Advisory Technical Assistance in PRC (2001), identified \na number of constraints that contributed to inefficient use of financial and other inputs by the \nGovernment and ADB: 2 (i) occasionally supply-driven TA topic selection, (ii) lack of executive \nagency ownership and involvement in the TA design and implementation, (iii) poor consultant \nperformance, and (iv) ineffectively disseminated and used TA outputs. \n \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2001. PRC/Improving Efficiency of ADTAs Operation in the PRC. Manila. ", "      3\n11.  Topic selection, and timing  of TA implementation  and output delivery are key  to TA \nsuccess. However,  from inclusion of TAs in the country assistance program to  fact finding, \nrecruiting consultants, implementing the TA, and producing reports normally takes 2\u20133 years. In \nsome cases, the TA outputs are only available after major policy decisions have been made. In \nother  cases,  the  recommendations  turn  out  to  be  less  relevant  because  of  changing \ncircumstances.  Sometimes  the  recommendations  are  made  but  cannot  be  implemented \nbecause the issue is no longer a high priority on the Government\u2019s agenda.   \n \n12.  Policy  reform  in  the  PRC  is  a  dynamic  process  covering  the  whole  gamut  of \ndevelopment  issues.  Accurately  projecting  2\u20133  years  in  advance  the  precise  timing  and \nsequencing of reform initiatives is not possible. The Government does significant research on \nmany policy topics simultaneously, and then decides to move ahead with specific reforms when \npreparation work matures and conditions3 for implementation are appropriate. To improve TA \nefficiency and impact, a flexible approach has been developed at the request of, and with active \nsupport from, the Government. While some of the components were identified during the TA fact \nfinding, other suitable components will be identified during TA implementation. The intention is \nto allow ADB to rapidly provide assistance on a range of policy issues. \n \n13.  Designing policy reform actions requires a thorough  analysis that identifies  detailed \npolicy options and implications. The PRC has set national goals in many areas of economic and \nsocial development. The best path to achieve these goals should be selected from a range of \ncompeting options that have emerged from research over a period of years. Supporting the final \npolicy  decision-making  requires  knowledge  of  related  technical  know-how, implementation \nmethods,  information  dissemination,  and  international  experience  in  balancing  the  parties\u2019 \ninterests and addressing other possible difficulties. Such information will help the Government \nselect the best implementation actions, paths, and contingency plans related to policies under \nconsideration.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n14.  The TA objective is to provide timely responses from ADB in the period close to the final \ndecision making to support policy reforms that are consistent with the four pillars of the CSP: (i) \npromoting equitable and inclusive growth, (ii) making markets work better, (iii) fostering regional \ncooperation, and (iv) promoting environmental sustainability.  \n \n15.  During fact finding, four policy areas were identified (Appendix 3) in close consultation \nwith the Government as examples of the type of assistance that can be provided. For each \npolicy area, the Government plans to make major  reform decisions in 2004 or 2005.  The \ncomponents and their outputs are the following:  \n \n(i)  Private sector development. Outputs are (a) a study identifying major issues \nand policy actions to promote private sector development; and (b) background \npapers analyzing the issues and constraints faced by the private sector, covering \nareas such as property rights, the legal and judicial system, level playing field, \ntransparency,  entry  and  exit  mechanisms,  taxes  and  fees,  investment  and \nfinancing,  human  resources,  industry  associations,  and  the  role  of  the \n                                                 \n3Such conditions include institutional capability, the complementary legal and regulatory framework, progress in \nreforms in other sectors, public opinion, performance of the domestic economy, and external conditions. \n ", " 4   \nGovernment. The Government will use the study\u2019so utput to formulate important \npolicy documents for private sector development. \n \n(ii)  Government  procurement.  Outputs  are  (a)  a  paper  on  the  design  of \nGovernment  procurement  regulations  within  the  framework  of  the  2002 \nGovernment Procurement Law, (b) papers on the practices of European Union \nand United States, and (c) E-based procedures to implement the Government \nprocurement policy.  MOF will conduct a conference in the fall of 2004  on the \nEuropean Union\u2019s practices of using government procurement as a tool for social \neconomic  development;  the  policy  and  implementation  of  United  States \nGovernment procurement;  an introduction to, and impact evaluation of, ADB\u2019s \nprocurement policies in developing member countries; and the means and trends \nof using E-based procedures to implement government procurement policy.  \n \n(iii)  Fiscal reform. This component will cover fiscal expenditure efficiency evaluation \n(FEEE), and the outputs include (a) papers on international FEEE; and (b) \nresearch papers on the design of regulations, evaluation index systems, and \ninstitutional arrangements. MOF will conduct  a conference in the fall of 2004 to \nintroduce best international experience and lessons learned in other countries. \nThe  target  audience  will  include  Government officials  and  international and \ndomestic experts. The information presented at the conference will be used to \nhelp design and implement a suitable system. Based on the  results of the \nconference, MOF will establish a task force to produce a policy paper on FEEE \nand publish the relevant materials.  \n \n(iv)  Budget law. The output will be a report consisting of examination of budget laws \nof countries such as France, Japan and Brazil, survey of the implementation of \nthe  Budget  Law  of  PRC,  and  proposed  amendments  to  the  Law.  To  build \nconsensus on the legislative recommendations, the Committee for the Budget \nLaw  Amendment  under  the  Standing  Committee  of  the  National  People\u2019s \nCongress (NPC) will conduct a conference targeting  government officials and \ndomestic  experts.  All  these  efforts  are  to  prepare  for  the  draft  Budge  Law \namendments to be submitted to NPC in 2006. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n16.  The TA will allow ADB to quickly support the PRC\u2019s policy reform. The TA design is \nflexible enough to allow selection of some topics during TA implementation. The criteria for topic \nselection include the following: (i) all topics are consistent with the reform agenda set out in the \nPRC CSP, (ii) the Government must accord the policy reform a high priority, (iii) the proposed \npolicy reform has reached a mature stage and the Government is close to making a decision, \nand (iv) a small amount of strategic assistance will help push the reform agenda forward. \n \n17.  To produce the outputs, ADB will work with the Government to identify international \nexperts as well as top domestic experts who are working in relevant areas in either the public or \nprivate sector. These experts will, in some cases, be used as short-term resource persons to \nintroduce international best practice; provide in-depth local knowledge; and advise on the policy \noptions, challenges, and implications of various courses of action. ADB staff will closely monitor \nthe  TA  progress  and  outputs,  and  conduct  policy  discussions with relevant  Government \nagencies. Because the TA will cover a range of policy areas, the Resident Mission in the PRC ", "      5\nwill administer the TA while sector divisions will lead in some areas that directly support the \nagenda for policy dialogue.   \n \n18.  The TA will include active Government participation in topic selection, assistance design, \nand implementation. The Government will help identify suitable experts to undertake studies \nand make presentations at conferences. The conferences and workshops will be designed to \nbuild consensus on policy and implementation issues. During the conferences and workshops, \nintensive consultations will be conducted between working-level officials and international and \ndomestic officials. The assistance will include information dissemination mechanisms in English \nand Chinese.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n19.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $600,000 equivalent, comprising $130,000 in \nforeign exchange costs and $470,000 equivalent in local currency costs. ADB will provide \n$450,000 equivalent on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA funding program to finance the entire \nforeign exchange cost and $320,000 equivalent of local currency costs. The Government will \ncontribute $150,000 equivalent in kind for office space, counterpart staff, honorarium, and other \nmiscellaneous services. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \n20.  The cost estimate is based on engaging a total of 12 international experts as resource \npersons and 16 domestic experts as resource persons or individual consultants. The resource \npersons and individual consultants will be engaged in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants and other arrangements, satisfactory to ADB.  For each component, \nconferences and workshops or seminars will be held to discuss the issues, build consensus, \nand disseminate information. The line items under conference and seminars will cover costs \nrelated  to  venue,  equipment  rental,  translation,  printing  and  copying,  and  logistics  and \nadministration support. If needed, surveys and field investigations will also be undertaken.  In \naddition, to facilitate implementation of the seminars and conference, advance payment facility \ncan be provided to the implementing agencies (IAs). \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n21.  MOF will be the Executing Agency for the TA, responsible for coordination and direct \nimplementation of activities related to fiscal reform and Government procurement. The All-China \nFederation of Industry and Commerce and NPC will be the IAs for the work on the private sector \nstudy and the Budget Law, respectively. The  IAs for other components will depend on the \ntopics. In addition to office space,  MOF and  the IAs will provide counterpart staff and other \nsupport.  The Government and ADB will identify additional issues high on the Government\u2019s \npolicy agenda and fit in the four pillars of ADB\u2019s operation in the CSP. Support is needed \nquickly. The TA is expected to commence in July 2004, and be complete by December 2005. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $450,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019sR epublic of China for the Facility for Policy Reform, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board.  \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \nMonitoring  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Performance Indicators/Targets \nMechanisms  and Risks \nGoal       \nSupport elements of  \u2022  Inclusive and equitable economic growth  \u2022  Monitoring by  \u2022  The Government\u2019s \nthe agenda for policy  \u2022  An enabling environment for private sector  PRCM   commitment to \nreform outlined in  development  \u2022  Government  policy reform  \nADB\u2019s Country  \u2022  Improved governance in government  reports   \u2022  Sustained \nStrategy Program in  procurement  \u2022  ADB review  macroeconomic \nthe PRC  \u2022  Improved design and implementation of fiscal  missions  development \n  policy \n\u2022  Improved road safety \nPurpose       \nEnhance the  \u2022  By 2006 the Government adopts a policy road  \u2022  Monitoring by  The Government \nefficiency of  map to promote private sector development  PRCM  adopts \npolicymaking and  \u2022  By 2005 the Government adopts regulations  \u2022  Government  recommendations \nimplementation in  to implement the Procurement Law  reports   developed under the \nselected areas  \u2022  Continuing progress by MOF in planning to  \u2022  ADB review  TA. \n  establish an FEEE system  missions   \n\u2022  Amended Bdget Law     \n\u2022  Others to be determined upon the \nconfirmation of additional TA components \nOutputs       \n1.

Private Sector Development \n1.  Background \n1.  The  private  sector 1  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China P(RC)\u2014domestic \nbusinesses  and  foreign-invested  enterprises\u2014has  grown  rapidly  over  the  past  two \ndecades. In 2002, it contributed more than 70% of gross domestic product (GDP) and \nmore than half of urban employment. However, private sector development is hampered \nby many constraints: (i) lack of access to finance, (ii) unavailability of managerial and \ntechnical skills, (iii) unavailability of information, (iv) nontransparent and/or inconsistent \nimplementation of policies and regulations, (v)  local protectionism, (vi) absence of fair \ncompetition laws and policies and other deficiencies in the market, and (vii) lack of a fully \ndeveloped  legal  and  regulatory  framework.2 These  are  barriers  to  foreign  direct \ninvestment in the western region.3 The All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce \n(ACFIC) and International Finance Corporation have undertaken related studies in this \narea. \n \n2.  Some progress has been made in addressing the legal challenges and policy \nissues adversely affecting  private sector development.  Protection of legally acquired \nprivate property  was included in  a March 2004  constitutional amendment. Still, much \nmore progress is needed to develop an environment for private sector development. \nThis is among the Government\u2019s top economic priorities. More than 20 provinces and \ncities have issued policy guidelines in this area. Now, the central Government needs a \nclear policy road map with time-bound action plans for Government agencies to remove \nthe impediments to and promote private sector development. The Government needs to \nset policy guidelines to implement the 2004 constitutional amendment. A study will be \nneeded to recommend policy actions that can be used as a basis for designing the policy \nframework and detailed guidelines. \n \n2.  Generic Terms of Reference for Consultants \n3.  ACFIC will form a task force for private sector development with a group of top \ndomestic experts and assign them different tasks. These experts will be hired to conduct \nstudies in (i)  property rights,  (ii) legal and judicial system,  (iii) level playing field, (iv) \ntransparency, (v) entry and exit mechanisms, (vi) taxes and fees, (vii) investment and \nfinancing, (viii) human resources, and (ix)  industry associations and  the role of  the \nGovernment. These experts will include well-known nongovernment experts who have \ndone  solid  research  in  relevant  areas,  and  government  officials  who  have  long \n                                                 \n1 The private sector means the nonpublic sector.  \n2  ADB. 2000.

After completion of the draft, ACFIC will organize several round-table discussions \nwithin the task force, and two conferences with relevant Government agencies to build \nconsensus on the results of the analysis of the issues, constraints, and proposed policy \nactions.  \n \nB.  Government Procurement \n1.  Background  \n5.  The  Government  procurement  mechanism  is  a  policy  means  for  fiscal \nexpenditure  management.  Government  procurement  amounted  to  CNY100.0 billion \n($12.0 billion) in 2002, an increase from CNY13.0 billion in 1999, CNY32.8 billion in \n2000, and CNY65.0 billion in 2001. Government procurement covers from county and \ncity level and up. The scope of procurement has expanded rapidly.  \n \n6.  To strengthen the legal base of the Government procurement system,  ADB \nprovided  a  technical  assistance5 to  support  the  drafting  of  the  2002  Government \nProcurement Law and implementing regulations. The law mandates market competition \nin the  Government procurement process.
