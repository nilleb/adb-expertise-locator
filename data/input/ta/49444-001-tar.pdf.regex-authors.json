INTRODUCTION \n1.  Implementing projects in the Pacific is challenging. Most Pacific island countries are in a \nfragile  and  conflict-affected  situation,  or  close  to  such  situation  as  defined  by  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). They are small, geographically isolated, dependent on aid, and \nvulnerable to the effects of climate change. \n \n2.  In the 2014 action plan developed to implement the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020,1 \nADB  recommitted  to  improving  operational  performance  by  strengthening  project \nimplementation, streamlining procurement, and fast-tracking disbursement. In the Pacific, ADB\u2019s \nprincipal development partners and cofinanciers have repeatedly stressed the need for ADB to \nincrease project implementation capacities and tailor procurement procedures to address the \nunique needs of and constraints facing Pacific island countries. In response, the ADB Pacific \nDepartment (PARD) and Operations Services and Financial Management Department prepared \nthe Pacific Project Improvement Action Plan (PIAP) to improve project performance in the \nPacific, which includes this proposed regional capacity development technical assistance (TA).2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  In developing the Pacific PIAP, PARD analyzed its portfolio performance in detail and \nfound that (i) project performance ratings for Pacific projects at completion were relatively low, \nalthough ratings have improved in since 2010;3 (ii) the performance ratings of ongoing Pacific \nprojects  are  lower  than  the  ADB  average,  with  59%  of  Pacific  projects rated  on  track  as \ncompared to the ADB average of 73% at the end of 2015; (iii) the PARD contract award ratio \nwas 23% in 2015, equal to the ADB average; (iv) the PARD disbursement ratio was 19.4% in \n2015, higher than the ADB average of 17.2%; and (v) project implementation in the Pacific is \ntypically delayed\u2014all 27 investment projects completed in 2011\u20132015 were extended. The \naverage implementation period for PARD projects was extended from 4.1 years to 6.6 years. \n \n4.  The  major  causes  of  poor  project  performance  were  (i)  insufficient  implementation \npreparation during project design; (ii) detailed designs were prepared following project approval; \n(iii) limited government essential capacity for project management, both in the number of staff \nand  their  skill  levels,  particularly  in  such  fundamental  areas  of  procurement,  financial \nmanagement, contract administration, and community engagement; (iv) time consuming land \nacquisition  procedures  and  inadequate  implementation  of  safeguard  plans;  and  (v) \ncommunication difficulties as a result of remoteness and inadequate communication facilities in \nthe region. \n \n5.  To  overcome  these  difficulties,  the  PIAP  proposes  actions  to  (i)  improve  project \npreparation, (ii) increase implementation support, (iii) streamline procurement, and (iv) increase \ndonor  coordination.  This  TA  is  designed  to  increase  implementation  support  and  thereby \nstrengthen the implementation capacities of executing agencies, and provide timely support for \nprojects that face implementation delays. \n \n6.  The TA aims to improve the performance of all ongoing and future loan and grant \nprojects in the Pacific. The TA is consistent with the ADB Pacific Approach, 2010\u20132014 and the \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2014. Midterm Review of Strategy 2020: Meeting the Challenges of a Transforming Asia and Pacific. Manila; \nand ADB. 2014. Midterm Review of Strategy 2020: Action Plan. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 22 February 2016. \n3  Of the Pacific projects completed in 2012\u20132014, 73% were rated highly successful or successful, compared with \nthe ADB average of 90%. \n ", "2 \nInterim Pacific Approach, 2015 and will support the monitoring of key portfolio performance \nindicators.4 The TA is included in the regional operations business plan, 2016\u20132018 for the \nPacific,5 and will be relevant in the future (improved project implementation remains a priority \nunder  the  forthcoming  Pacific  Approach,  2016\u20132020).  Although  TA  projects  have  been \napproved to assist the design and implementation of selected Pacific projects, there has been \nno  regional  TA  to  comprehensively  strengthen  the  project  implementation  capacities  of \nexecuting agencies, and thereby improve project performance. \n \n7.  The  TA  builds  on  the  10-point  action  plan  for  procurement  reform  to  improve \nprocurement performance by reducing procurement time, increasing administrative efficiency, \nand improving project delivery while maintaining sound fiduciary oversight. 6 The TA will also \ncontribute to implementation of the ADB plan for enhancing its effectiveness in fragile and \nconflict-affected  situations, 7  which  focuses  on  supporting  state-building  and  long-term \ninstitutional capacity development in fragile countries. \n \nIII.  THE REGIONAL CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact will be improved project implementation performance in the Pacific. The \noutcome  will  be  strengthened  capacity  of  executing  agencies  in  the  Pacific  to  implement \nprojects effectively. The indicators will be (i) at least 75% of ongoing projects are rated on track \nunder the project performance rating system; (ii) procurement processes are expedited, such \nthat, the time from project approval to the first contract award of major works or goods is \nreduced to 24 months, from 29.6 months for projects approved in 2009\u20132012; (iii) the time to \nreview bid evaluation reports is reduced to 10 working days, from 58 working days in 2015; (iv) \nthe annual contract award ratio is increased to above 26%; and (v) the annual disbursement \nratio is increased to above 22%. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA outputs will be: (i) establishment of project and procurement support team \n(PPST) and capacity building training given to staff of executing  and implementing agencies on \nproject management, including procurement, consultant selection, social and environmental \nsafeguard planning and measures, financial management including disbursement, and other \naspects of project management; (ii) provision of on-the-job problem solving and training to staff \nof executing and implementing agencies by PPST to  resolve project-specific implementation \nissues and constraints; (iii) conduct of country and/or regional portfolio review meetings; and (iv) \nestablishment of a new business process using a \u201cone consultant for one project\u201d approach, \nincluding consulting contracts with novation.8 \n \n10.  For  output  1,  16  capacity  building  training  will  be  held  in  four  groups  of  Pacific \ndeveloping  member  countries  (DMCs),  covering  procurement,  safeguards,  and  financial \n                                                \n4  ADB. 2015.

The capacity building sessions will be supported by experienced ADB staff in addition \nto the PPST. In collaboration with the ADB Budget, Personnel, and Management Systems \nDepartment, training on International Federation of Consulting Engineers (FIDIC) conditions of \ncontract,  general  conditions  of  contracts  by  the  Engineering  Advancement  Association  of \nJapan,10 or other contract forms will also be organized for Pacific counterparts. \n \n11.  For output 2, on-the-job problem solving and training for executing and implementing \nagencies  will  be  provided  on  demand  for  specific  projects,  and  will  supplement  project \npreparatory  TA  or  consulting  services  under  loan  and  grant  facilities.  This  on-the-job  and \nproject-specific  support  recognizes  that  (i)  consulting  services  requirements  under  project \npreparatory TA projects, loans, and grants are often underestimated or reduced due to budget \nconstraints; and (ii) mobilized consultants may be unfamiliar with ADB\u2019s procurement guidelines \nand safeguard requirements. \n \n12.  For output 3, the TA will help organize country and/or regional portfolio review meetings \nby financing participants\u2019 travel and accommodation, the venue, and other associated costs. \nThe portfolio review meetings will provide cross-learning opportunities for both DMC and ADB \nstaff  by  sharing  project  management  experiences  with  participants  who  work  for  different \nprojects. The TA will also finance expenses to organize business opportunity seminars where \ninformation  on  future  projects  and  bidding  opportunities  will  be  disseminated  to  attract \nprospective contractors and consultants. \n \n13.  For output 4, a new business process will be established that responds to the unique \nneeds  of  and  constraints  faced  by  small,  remote  Pacific  island  countries.  Under  the  \u201cone \nconsultant for one project\u201d approach, a single consultant will be responsible for a project from \npreparation to physical implementation. ADB\u2019s typical business process involves at least two \nconsultants for a given project, one for project preparation and the other for implementation. But \nfor  smaller  projects  in  the  Pacific,  involving  two  consultants  can  contribute  to  significant \ndelays\u2014requiring, for example discussions on engineering options or procurement procedures, \nin addition to the time needed for consultant recruitment; mobilization; and learning about the \nproject, local conditions, and related issues. The new business process is expected to reduce \nthe project period from concept establishment to completion by 9\u201315 months. \n \n14.  The risks in achieving the outcomes include (i) possible high staff turnover in executing \nand implementing agencies, (ii) political instability in some Pacific island countries, (iii) slow \ndecision-making in governments due to bureaucracy and multiple organizational interventions, \nand (iv) possible fraud and corruption in procurement processes. \n \n                                                \n9  For Papua New Guinea, the capacity building session will be held in Port Moresby. For the Cook Islands, Fiji, \nKiribati, Samoa, Tonga, and Tuvalu, it will be held in Suva. For Nauru, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu, it will be \nheld at the Pacific Liaison Coordination Office in Sydney, Australia. For the Marshall Islands, Federated States of \nMicronesia, Palau, and Timor-Leste, it will be held at ADB headquarters. Additional capacity building sessions will \nbe programmed as needed. \n10 Used for the procurement of plant, design, supply, and installation in ADB-funded projects. \n ", "4 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-V).  The  detailed  cost  estimates  are  in \nAppendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  ADB  will  be  the  executing  agency  responsible  for  coordinating,  supervising,  and \nimplementing all TA activities. PARD headquarters\u2019 project administration unit (PAU) will be the \nfocal point for the TA, working closely with ADB\u2019s Procurement Division 2, Office of the General \nCounsel, Loan Administration Division, and Strategy and Policy Department; PARD resident \nmission  PAUs;  and  executing  and  implementing  agencies  in the  Pacific. One  international \nconsultant\u2014a project management and/or procurement specialist\u2014will serve as team leader. \nThe project management and/or procurement specialist will organize capacity building programs \nand monitor the design and implementation status of PARD loan and grant projects, identify \ncapacity building needs and projects that require assistance from the TA, and deploy necessary \nspecialists to provide on-the-job training to executing agencies. \n \n17.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  from  April  2016  to  March  2018.  The  TA  will  engage \nindividual  international  and  national  consultants  to  form  the  PPST,  including  specialists  in \nproject management, procurement, social safeguards, environmental safeguards, and financial \nmanagement; and a procurement-focused legal expert. The procurement, social safeguard, \nenvironmental safeguard, and financial management specialists will require at least two national \nand/or international consultants for each position. They will be fielded to project sites for on-the-\njob problem solving and training on a flexible and timely basis. The TA will also mobilize FIDIC \nspecialists as resource persons for seminars on FIDIC conditions of contract. About 16 person-\nmonths  of  international  consultants,  6  person-months  of  national  consultants,  and  some \nresource persons will be required. All specialists will be recruited individually and engaged \nunder an indefinite contract when appropriate. \n \n18.  To ensure the focus of the TA activities, the TA implementation plan will be reviewed \nquarterly in coordination with PAU heads and staff implementing loan and grant projects and \nbased on information shared in PARD quarterly project performance review meetings. \n \n19.  Consultant selection will follow the ADB Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as \namended from time to time). Proceeds of the TA will be disbursed following the ADB Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis to \nall Pacific developing member countries for Building Project Implementation Capacities in the \nPacific, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "Appendix 1  5 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the Project is Aligned with: \nImproved project implementation performance in the Pacifica \n \n  Performance Indicators with  Date Sources and \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Reporting  Risks \nOutcome       \n  By the end of 2018:     \nStrengthened  a.
