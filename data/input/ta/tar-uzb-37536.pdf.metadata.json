The Government of Uzbekistan requested  technical assistance (TA) from the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to prepare the Land Improvement Project. The TA, which is included \nin the country assistance plan for 2004, will help the Government prepare a project that will \naddress land degradation and increase agricultural productivity. ADB in March 2004 reached an \nunderstanding with the Government on the objectives, output, implementation arrangements, \ncosts, and financing arrangements for the TA.1 A preliminary framework for the proposed project \nis presented in Appendix 1. \n  ISSUES \n2.  More than half of the Central Asian region is highly affected by land degradation,2 \ncaused by geological, geomorphological, and human factors. The dominant natural causes of \nland degradation in Central Asia are water and wind, compounded by human activities that \ncontribute to rapid soil and water contamination. Human activities, mainly incorrect irrigation \npractices and inadequate drainage, by far surpass natural causes of soil salinity. The economic \ncosts of land degradation can be assessed at three levels: on-farm decline in productivity;  \nnational  lower  growth  of  the  agriculture  sector;  and  global  negative  impact  on  carbon \nsequestration and climate change, loss of productive capacity of agricultural land, damage to \nbiodiversity conservation, and pollution of transnational water resources.  Introducing  large-\nscale irrigation in the region also resulted in sizable water abstraction from the Amudarya and \nSyrdarya rivers, and a decline of the Aral Sea to less than 50% of its original area.  \n3.  Agriculture in Uzbekistan \u2014 which accounts for 35% of the gross domestic product, 45% \nof employment, 60% of export revenues, and nearly half of the employment of the population3 in \nrural areas \u2014 is seriously affected by land degradation. Due to the arid climate, the country\u2019s \nagriculture is entirely dependent on irrigation. Currently 4.2 million hectares (ha) of the country\u2019s \ntotal arable area of 4.8 million ha are irrigated, corresponding to 54% of the total irrigated area \nin the Aral Sea Basin.4 Increased use of irrigation water led to larger drainage flows and \noverloaded the drainage systems. \n \n4.  Inadequate drainage capacities, extensive water use to leach salts, and lack of natural \ndrainage  increase  waterlogged  areas  and  soil  salinity,5  the  two  main  reasons  for  land \ndegradation. It is estimated6 that in 2002, waterlogging and soil salinity affected some 46% of \nthe country\u2019s irrigated area. Due to increased land degradation, agricultural production and farm \nproductivity are declining, farms are incurring losses, and rural incomes are falling. 7Cotton yield \nlosses are estimated to be in the range of 25% for moderately saline soils and 60% for highly \nsaline soils. Similar yield losses are observed for food crops (wheat, grains, etc.). Annual loss of \ncrop production in Uzbekistan due to land salinization/degradation is estimated8 at $31 million, \nthe economic value of land abandoned due to high salinity is $12 million, and the cost of \nadditional water for annual leaching of salts accumulated in the soil is $51 million. Land loss due \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 12 February 2004. \n2 According to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification,  66% of the agricultural land area  in \nKazakhstan, 80% in Uzbekistan, over 88% in Kyrgyzstan, and 97% in Tajikistan suffer from various degrees of \ndegradation. \n3 The share of the rural population in Uzbekistan increased from 60% in 1991 to 63% in 2000. \n4  Irrigation in Uzbekistan consumes 51% of the river basin flows of Syrdarya and 42% of Amudarya. \n5 Soil salinization is also related to inadequate budget allocations and weak capacity of water sector institutions. \n6 Asian Development Bank. 2003.

Thus, land degradation directly affects the \noverall  performance  of  the  agriculture  sector,  incomes,  and  living  standards  of  the  rural \npopulation.  \n5.  The  Government  regards  land  improvement/reclamation  and  rehabilitation  of  key \ndrainage  facilities  as  important  to  protect  the  livelihoods  of  the  large  rural  population. \nGovernment policy in the water sector aims at (i) securing reliable irrigation supplies, (ii) \nimproving irrigation and drainage efficiency through rehabilitation of infrastructure, (iii) providing \nadequate resources for operation and maintenance (O&M), and (iv) improving and transferring \nthe management of these systems to the end users. In 2003, the Ministry of Agriculture and \nWater Resources (MAWR) reorganized its irrigation organizations into river basin organizations \n(RBOs) based on hydrologic boundaries. New water users associations (WUAs) are being \nformed, and responsibilities for water delivery and O&M of infrastructure are being handed over \nto those organizations. In March 2004, the Government prepared a new initiative to test market \nprinciples in the use of water resources and develop a mechanism for introducing water delivery \nfees.  \n6.  However, despite the Government\u2019s efforts, land degradation during the last decade has \nincreased  substantially.  A  new  approach  to  arrest  land  degradation,  based  on  better \nmanagement  of  soil  and  water,  is  needed.  Rural  communities\u2019  capacities  to  maintain  the \ndrainage and irrigation systems, introduce on-farm water and soil conservation technologies, \nand  sustain  improvement  of  the  rural  living  standards  need  to  be  enhanced.  Additional \ninvestments and policy actions are required to improve the management of water resources; \nimprove O&M; and gradually introduce an incentive structure for water conservation at national, \nregional, project, and on-farm levels. Actions to empower private farmers to manage their farm \noperations and crop production are also needed.  \n7.  A number of multilateral and bilateral agencies finance projects in the agriculture and \nwater sectors in Uzbekistan. The World Bank is supporting the Government\u2019s reform agenda \nthat includes support to private farms, rehabilitation of drainage infrastructure, water resources \nmanagement, and rural credit.9 The United States Agency for International Development is \nfinancing the regional Natural Resources Management Program comprising improvement of \nwater resource management, water conservation, irrigation system automation, and capacity \nbuilding  for  water  agencies.  The  Swiss  Agency  for  Development  and  Cooperation  is \nimplementing the Integrated Water Resource Management Project in Fergana valley to assist in \nbuilding the capacity of water sector institutions and reorganizing water management. The \nEuropean Union supports land registration, training for farmers, and crop forecasting. \n8.  ADB's  Country  Operational  Strategy  for  Uzbekistan  and  the  Country  Strategy  and \nProgram Update emphasize the need for policy and investment interventions in the agriculture \nand water sectors to increase productivity and income, and to generate employment. The \nobjectives  of  the  proposed  Land  Improvement  Project,  e.g.  increasing  incomes  of  rural \npopulation, through increased land quality and productivity, are in line with these documents. \nCurrently,  ADB  finances  two  projects  in  the  water  sector  \u2014  the  Ak  Altin  Agriculture \nDevelopment Project and Amu Zang Irrigation Rehabilitation Project.10 These projects support \nthe rehabilitation of irrigation facilities, strengthening of WUAs, and reforms in the agriculture \n                                                 \n9  Projects  under  implementation  are  the  Rural  Enterprise  Support  Project;  Drainage,  Irrigation  and  Wetlands \nImprovement Project; and Water and Environmental Management Project. \n10 Loans 1883-UZB and 2069-UZB.  ", "    3 \nand water sectors. ADB also finances two regional TAs,11 which promote improved farming \ntechnologies and water conservation, and support the formulation of national action plans to \ncombat  desertification.  In  March  2004,  the  Government  signed  a  Memorandum  of \nUnderstanding with ADB for the improvement of water supply in the rural areas of Kashkadarya \nand Navoi provinces.12  \n9.  To mitigate and reverse land degradation, and improve farm productivity and incomes of \nthe rural population, in 2003 the Government requested ADB financing for land improvement \nprojects in provinces most affected by land degradation: Bukhara, Djisak, Kashkadarya, Navoi, \nSurkhandarya, and Syrdarya. Irrigated areas amount to 273,700 ha in Bukhara, 124,400 ha in \nNavoi, and 504,500 ha in Kashkadarya.13 In many areas of these provinces, land degradation \nhas led to over 30% decrease in agricultural productivity. Other lands will become unsuitable for \ncultivation in a few decades.  \n10.  The total population of the three provinces is above 4,400,000 of whom 85% reside in \nrural  areas.  The  main  source  of  income  of  the  rural  population  is  agricultural  production \ndominated by cotton and wheat, which heavily depends on irrigation. Off-farm employment \nopportunities are very limited, and the deteriorating land quality and declining crop yields have \nserious negative impact on living standards. This impact is expected to worsen in the future, \nconsidering the high population growth rate in the rural areas, which would raise demographic \npressure  on  the  limited  land  resources.  Therefore,  the  cost  of  inaction  is  high,  as  land \ndegradation,  if  not  arrested  and  reversed,  would  lead  to  increased  poverty  and  social \nimbalance, desertification, and further environmental degradation.  \n  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n11.  The main purpose of the TA is to assist the Government to formulate and carry out a \nfeasibility study for the Land Improvement Project aimed at  stopping the worsening of land \ndegradation and restoring land quality/productivity. It is envisaged that the project will increase \nagricultural productivity and provide farmers with opportunities for sustained and increased \nincomes.  \n \n12.  The TA output is a project feasibility report that will contain the following: \n(i)  a project framework, prepared in consultation with the stakeholders and comprising \nthe goals, purpose, and specific objectives of the project;  \n(ii)  proposals for improving land and water management practices at the project and \ncountry levels; \n(iii)  updated  agriculture  and  water  sector  profiles  prepared  under  the  Amu  Zhang \nIrrigation Rehabilitation Project;14 including recent Government policies, long-term \nand midterm plans, farm privatization and restructuring process, foreign assistance, \nand implemented water resources projects;  \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2000.

Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The key TA activities are as follows:  \n(i)  identifying  priority  areas15  for  cost-effective  land  improvement/reclamation16 \nthrough  low-cost  technologies,  introducing  bio-drainage  on  marginal  lands, \ntargeting  rehabilitation  of  drainage  facilities,  and  preparing  socioeconomic \nprofiles  of  the  proposed  project  areas,  including  gender-disaggregated data \nrelevant to agriculture in the project area; \n(ii)  reviewing policies and institutions in the water sector, and preparing proposals \nfor changes needed to support sustainable project implementation, including \nsupport to RBOs, WUAs, and introduction of water delivery fees;17  \n(iii)  developing a package of cost-effective interventions for efficient use of land and \nwater through (a) integrated irrigation and drainage management; (b) low-cost \nprioritized O&M18 procedures; (c) innovative on-farm water and soil conservation \npractices19  (including  precise  land  leveling,  subsoiling,  crop  diversification, \nintroducing salt-tolerant fodder crops);  \n(iv)  preparing  proposals  for  priority  rehabilitation  of  key  water  control/distribution \nstructures needed for efficient irrigation water delivery to private farms; and \n(v)  assessing the impact of improved land quality/productivity and integrated water \nmanagement on the environment, and on poverty, and an initial environmental \nexamination (IEE) of the project.  \n14.  The proposed investment will be based on the results of the social assessment to \nensure that the poor will benefit from the interventions supported under the project. The project \ndesign and arrangements for O&M will be determined through stakeholder consultations and \nfocused  group  discussions,  involving  local  governments,  village  organizations,  and \nbeneficiaries.  The  TA  will  take  into  account  the  beneficiaries\u2019  self-help potential, examine \ninstitutional arrangements, and rely on consultations with stakeholders and beneficiaries.  A \nsummary of the initial poverty and social analysis is in Appendix 2.  \n                                                 \n15 Details in Appendix 4, Outline Terms of Reference. \n16 Project interventions will be limited to areas with reliable irrigation supplies, and low or moderate saline soils, where   \nsubstantial improvement of land productivity could be achieved with relatively low investments.  \n17 In line with ADB\u2019s policies, and technical notes Beyond Cost Recovery and  Setting Users Charges for Public \nServices of the ADB\u2019s Economic and Research Department. \n18 Using simplified computerized simulation to prioritize the maintenance of canals and drains.   \n19 Results from the ADB-financed TA 5866 (footnote 11) indicate more than 25% reduction of water application at on-\nfarm level.

The project will be subject to an IEE, which will follow ADB\u2019s environmental guidelines \nindicated  at  ADB\u2019s  website  http://adbweb/Documents/Guidelines/Environmental \nAssessment/default.asp). If an environmental impact assessment (EIA) is needed, the TA will \nprepare  terms  of  reference  for  EIA,  including  a  description  of  tasks,  time  schedule,  and \nestimated costs.   \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $850,000 equivalent, comprising $420,000 in \nforeign  exchange  and  $430,000  equivalent  in  local  currency.  ADB  will  finance  $550,000 \nequivalent consisting of the entire foreign exchange cost and $130,000 equivalent in local \ncurrency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The \nGovernment will provide $300,000 equivalent to cover the in-kind counterpart costs for office \naccommodation, data compilation, logistical support, and counterpart staff costs. Detailed cost \nestimates are in Appendix 3. The Government has been informed that approval of the TA does \nnot commit ADB to finance any ensuing project.   \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  MAWR will be the Executing Agency for the TA. A steering committee (SC), chaired by \nthe first deputy minister of MAWR, will be established to supervise TA implementation. The SC \nwill  include  representatives  from  the  ministries  of  environment,  economy,  finance,  local \nauthorities, and other concerned agencies, and will meet periodically to review TA progress and \nthe proposed project design, as required. SC members and ADB staff will participate in SC \nmeetings and workshops at key stages of TA implementation. \n18.  The TA will be implemented from October 2004 to March 2005.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n \nContribution of the Agriculture and Water Sectors to Reduce Poverty in Uzbekistan  \nAgriculture is a dominant sector in Uzbekistan\u2019s economy, and it accounts for 35% of the gross \ndomestic  product,  45%  of  employment,  and  60%  of  export  revenues.  National  level  poverty \nincidence1 in Uzbekistan is estimated at 27.5%. Of Uzbekistan\u2019s poor, 70% (approximately 4.5 million \npeople)  live  in  rural  areas.  The  rural  population  especially  the  poor,  is  highly  dependent  on \nagriculture: rural nonfarm employment outside of the state and large enterprises account for less than \n10% of rural nonagricultural employment in rural areas, with the self-employed accounting for nearly \nhalf of these.  \nThere are at least two ways in which land improvement will make significant inroads in combating \npoverty in the country. First, improved productivity will translate to higher outputs and increased  \nincomes of the rural poor, as deteriorating land quality and lack of access to modern on-farm \ntechnologies limit crop yields and constrain their cash income. \nSecond,  agriculture  can  contribute  to  reducing  poverty  by  creating  jobs.  With  the  limited rural \nemployment opportunities and the poor performance of agriculture, wages in the sector have been \ndepressed. Improved farm productivity and profitability, therefore, are key to a sustained expansion of \nrural labor demand.  \nB.  Poverty Analysis              Proposed Classification: Poverty Intervention \n \nWhat type of Poverty Analysis Is Needed? \nAssessment of Poverty in the Proposed Project Areas.  Poverty in the southern region, where \nKashkadarya and Surkhandarya oblasts are located is nearly twice the national average. The relative \nrisks of extreme poverty in this region are even higher, nearly three times the national average. \nFurthermore, the southern region accounts for 28% of the poor and 46% of the extreme poor. In \nKashkadarya,  20.3% of the population is poor, and the extreme poor account for 38.2%. In Navoi,  \n2.2% is poor and 1.8% extreme poor. The Bukhara region accounts for 2.8% of the poor and 1.1% of \nthe extreme poor.2 \nDuring the first-stage screening of the proposed project areas under the technical assistance (TA), \ndata will be collected to assess the living standard of the population. The data will be sourced \nprimarily from existing secondary data. The gender-disaggregated living standard survey data, along \nwith data on infrastructure repairs, ongoing projects, expected economic returns and sustainability, \nand environment impacts will be used to rank the candidate districts. Therefore, project interventions \nto improve land productivity will help raise the standards of living of the poorest of the rural poor. \nOnce the project districts are selected, in-depth poverty incidence will be estimated by community \nprofiling through participatory rural appraisal (PRA). \nProfiling the Poor.  The  nationwide  reform  process  in  agriculture  has  reduced  public  sector \nemployment in farm enterprises. As a result, incomes of the poor are derived mainly from individual \nplots. The overall number of households with plots has reached 2.5 million, and the average plot size \nper family has increased from 0.12 ha to 0.19 ha. Government statistics indicate that these garden \nplots generate on average 30% of total rural family income and 70-90% of total income for low-\n                                                 \n1 As there is no official poverty line in Uzbekistan, the Project opted to adopt a poverty threshold based on the   \nrequired calories per person per day used in many countries, which is equivalent to 2,100 calories per person per \nday. A food-based poverty line would amount to SUM3,765/month at October 2000 prices; this is less than half the \nvalue of the minimum wage in 2001. \n2   World Bank. 2003. Living Standards Assessment.

At the national level,  \nwomen among the officially unemployed comprised 62% as of the beginning of 2001.3 Women and \nchildren from poor households are typically employed during the cotton-harvesting season.  \nPoverty Impact Assessment of Project. During the feasibility design, in-depth analysis will be made \non how the project components and supportive policy reforms help prevent or reduce poverty in the \nproposed project area. Parallel assessment will also be made on the social impacts of the project on \nindicators such as access to food and potable water, reduced incidence of illnesses, and reduced \nunemployment. \nC.   Participation Process \nStakeholders Identified  \nThe project will involve a wide range of stakeholders. The assessment of issues, design of project \nscope, arrangement of project implementation, monitoring and operation and maintenance will be \nconducted with the participation of the following stakeholders:  \n(i)  dehkan farms farmers, individual farm and rural households, and representatives \nof remaining state-owned collective farms;  \n(ii)  village organizations;  \n(iii)  water  users  associations;  farmers  associations  (local  and  national);  district \ngovernments  (including  agriculture  and  water  resources,  health  and \nenvironmental monitoring departments and water and electricity utilities);  \n(iv)  province (oblast) governments (including committee for environmental protection) \nand industrial enterprises;  \n(v)  civic and nongovernment organizations;  \n(vi)  ministries of agriculture and water resources, health, environment, and other \nGovernment agencies; and \n(vii)  other concerned agencies and organizations.  \nDuring  social  assessment,  broad  consultations  with  key  stakeholders  will  be  conducted  using \nqualitative and quantitative approaches. The analysis will pay attention to potential project impacts on \nvulnerable  groups,  including  women,  low-income  people,  downstream  water  users,  and  ethnic \nminorities. \nParticipation Strategy \nA mechanism needs to be developed to ensure that the primary target beneficiaries (farm households, \nfarm  employees,  and  rural  communities)  will  be  able  to  benefit  from  the  proposed  project.  A \nparticipation plan will be developed to (i) identify the target beneficiaries and vulnerable groups and (ii) \ninvolve them in designing, implementing, and monitoring and evaluating the project components. The \nparticipation  process  will  encompass  (i)  dissemination  of  information,  (ii)  consultations  with \nbeneficiaries  and  population  groups  that  could  be  negatively  affected  by  the  project,  and  (iii) \ncooperation between concerned people and institutions.  \nA  combination  of  quantitative  analysis  (village  surveys),  qualitative  data  gathering  (community \nconsultation meetings, information sharing and training workshops, and focused group discussions), \nand review of secondary information will identify issues and the needs of the poor and vulnerable \ngroups.  \nRequired Social Assessment  \nTA study will \n(i)  develop a comprehensive profile of the target groups and associated organizations likely \n \n3 Statistical Collection. 2002.
