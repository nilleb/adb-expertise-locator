During the Country Programming Mission in 2001, the Government of Vanuatu and the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) agreed that ADB will provide grant funding for an advisory \ntechnical assistance project (TA) in 2003 to enhance the technical and vocational education and \ntraining  (TVET)  system.  The  agreement  was  confirmed  during  the  Country  Programming \nMission in May 2002. \n \n2.  An ADB Fact-Finding Mission visited Vanuatu 26 September-18 October 2002.1 The \nMission consulted widely with representatives from government agencies, formal and nonformal \ntraining providers, and aid agencies. The Mission visited Santo, Malekula, and Tanna islands \nand consulted with the provincial governments and education advisors, and training providers. \nThe TA framework is in Appendix 1 and the summary initial social and poverty analysis is in \nAppendix 2. The Government reconfirmed its strong interest in and support for the TA, and \nhighlighted its timeliness.2  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Over  the  past  4  years,  the  Government  has  focused  on  implementing  the \nComprehensive  Reform  Program  (CRP).  The  CRP  has  emphasized  macroeconomic  and \ngovernance reforms and professionalization of the public sector. Much has been achieved in \nthose areas, but the economic and political environment is still weak and unstable. Moreover, \nrural areas have not seen an improvement in the delivery of basic services, nor has economic \ndevelopment taken place there. The Prime Minister's annual policy statement of 3 June 2002 \nreconfirmed this situation and stressed the importance of rural development as a key element in \nthe Government's vision for Vanuatu.  \n \n4.  Among 174 countries, Vanuatu ranks 124th  on the human development index. The \nUnited  Nations  considers  this  rank  as  medium  range;  nevertheless,  a  recently  conducted \nparticipatory poverty assessment3 indicates that the threat of poverty is increasing. Education \nstandards are considered the poorest in the Pacific region. Adult literacy is only 64%, and infant \nmortality is high at 41 per 1,000 live births. \n \n5.  The estimated population growth rate is 3%, with the population under the age of 15 \nyears comprising 42.7% and  growth rate being 31.3% in the age group 15-35 years. Further, \nabout 80% of the population live in rural areas, in geographically isolated small communities.  \nCurrent trends indicate that the number of rural people could double over the next 23 years. \nRecent  reviews  of  community  priorities  undertaken  by  the  Rural  Economic  Development \nInitiatives (REDI) program as well as other community assessments and surveys of both formal \nand informal labor market demand all point to a common requirement of skills training to attain  \nlocal development priorities and the income-generating aspirations of the youth and rural people \nin  general.  This  demographic  and  socioeconomic  backdrop  makes  skills  development \nimperative and explains the priority given to providing skills in a variety of government initiatives. \nThe initiatives range from the CRP to the more recent move to reassign the responsibilities of \nthe previous Ministry of Youth and Sport, which is now named the Ministry of Training and \nYouth Development (MTYD). \n                                                 \n1The  Mission  comprised  A.  Iffland,  Project  Economist/Mission  Leader,  ADB  HQ;  G.Hurley,  TVET \nSpecialist/Consultant; and S. Wirth, Trust Fund Specialist/Consultant.  \n2 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 13 November 2002. \n3 ADB. 2000. Regional Technical Assistance for Poverty Assessment in Pacific Developing Member Countries. \nManila.  ", "2  \n \n \n6.  In 2000, a review of TVET provided details of Vanuatu's system. The review included an \nassessment  of  the  demand  and  supply  of  nonformal  vocational  skills  training  and  the \ndevelopment of alternative strategies to enhance delivery.4  Assessments of the training needs \nof a sample of 22 rural communities from all six provinces revealed the lack of a wide range of \nbasic vocational skills, which are considered essential to improve the livelihood of the rural \ncommunities and generate supplementary cash income for families. An informal survey, which \nwas part of the TA (footnote 4), demonstrated the growing importance of this sector and the \ntype of business activities it comprises. The training levels of proprietors were generally low and \ntheir  perceived  training  needs  ranged  from  technical  skills  upgrading  to  small  business \nmanagement. On the supply side, skills development is currently undertaken by a variety of \nnonformal training providers, ranging from community-based rural training centers (RTCs) and \ninputs  from  church-led  groups,  women  and  youth  institutions,  and  other  nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs), mostly operating in the rural areas. RTCs are the only major training \nvenue in most parts of rural Vanuatu. However, the number of operational but ill-equipped RTCs \nhas declined from 44 in 1999 to under 30 in 2002 as they continue to face serious financial \nproblems. Most RTC managers quote the inability of students to pay course fees as the main \nreason. The very basic training offered by women and church groups is organized on an ad hoc \nbasis, subject to the availability of grant funding and the financial capacity of the participants. \nThe Government does not provide funding for nonformal training, but faces increased pressure \nto address the causes of the lack of skills training in rural areas. Formal, generally government-\nfunded, skills training is limited to two church-led technical schools and the Vanuatu Institute of \nTechnology (VIT). The latter offers officially recognized certificate and diploma courses. To date \nthere have been no formal linkages between the formal and nonformal training programs and \nonly limited contact in terms of information exchange, technical guidance, or assistance. Both \nthe review and the subsequent participatory workshop in 2001, which was attended by over 70 \nrepresentatives from relevant national and provincial institutions, showed that the  TVET must \nbe seen as part of a continuum of training opportunities, no matter where or how it was \ndelivered, and that such training should be targeted at providing a range of income-generating \nskills appropriate to local needs. The results of the workshop were taken up by the Vanuatu \nNational Training Council (VNTC) and (i) are reflected in the Bill for VIT, (ii) formed the starting \npoint for the Education for All (EFA) task force and are integrated into Vanuatu's National Action \nPlan for EFA, and (iii) are the key elements of the policy and budget directives for MTYD.   \n \n7.  The requirement of sustainable resources\u2013both financial and material\u2013to support and \nmaintain training initiatives at all levels, particularly in rural areas, was also stressed as a \npriority. These concerns were given further impetus by a subsequent consultation process in \nAugust 2002 at which over 80 stakeholders expressed their support for the policy directions \nprepared  for  the  new  MTYD  and  proposed  that  the  Government  should  adopt  the  \nrecommendation of UNESCO that access to TVET should be seen as a right as described in \nArticle 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. \n \n8.  To  address  these  issues  the  Government  has  already  enacted  legislation  that  has \nestablished the VNTC, with representation from concerned government ministries, the private \nsector, and formal and nonformal training providers. VNTC has been made responsible for \nplanning, coordinating, and assisting formal and nonformal TVET at both national and provincial \nlevels.  A  VNTC  secretariat  will  be  appointed  shortly  through  regular  official  budgetary \nallocations to facilitate these activities.  Further legislation has been prepared to broaden the \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance to Vanuatu for Preparing the Skills Development Project. Manila.  ", "    3 \nscope of VIT, giving it a wider responsibility that will enable it to provide sustainable technical \nand advisory support to the provinces and other nonformal training providers in areas such as \ntrainer training and curriculum development. To accomplish this wider scope, existing training \nfacilities, which can range from secondary and technical schools to RTCs, will be designated as \nVIT provincial campuses.5 The aim is to have one in each of the six provinces. These training \nfacilities will provide new bridging courses designed to provide linkages between formal and \nnonformal programs. Trained staff will provide a genuine provincially based TVET resource in \nterms of advice, guidance and materials available to all local training providers. Most important, \nthe new provincial campuses will introduce new modular training courses that can be used by all \nlocal training providers and which can build up to a Vanuatu Community Certificate and a \nVanuatu Foundation Certificate offering new options in literacy, numeracy, self-reliance and self-\nsubsistence, and personal and community development. Although each module will be a stand-\nalone  unit  capable  of  enhancing  an  individual\u2019s  capacity  to  improve  his  or  her  livelihood, \nassembled together over time they can open up a pathway to a formally recognized career \nstructure.  \n \n9.  To support  these initiatives and the institutions tasked with their implementation, there is \na need to develop new policies and delivery modalities.  Formal education already has its \nmaster plan. The TVET sector also needs a master plan to guide national development and to \nassist each province to set its own training priorities based on local needs already identified by \nREDI programs.  Proposals for provincial campuses need to be elaborated, their implications \nidentified, and their potential benefits assessed as part of the bridges that should be built \nbetween disadvantaged youth and rural communities and the opportunities presented by the \nformal labor market. To avoid the disappointment caused by failed expectations of potential \nbeneficiaries, these new developments need to be supported by sustainable funding resources. \nTrials are therefore needed to demonstrate how such sustainability of funding could be built into \nfuture developments of the TVET system in Vanuatu.        \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n10.  The  TA  will  assist  the  Government  to  establish  and  operationalize  a  national  and \nprovincial TVET framework that will facilitate continuous life-long learning. The framework will \nlay the foundation for a systematic and sustainable approach to provide young people and \nadults with equitable access to appropriate learning and life skills as stipulated in Vanuatu's \nnational action plan for EFA\u2013the overall goal the TA aims to contribute to.  The TA will have the \nfollowing outputs: (i) a national TVET master plan; (ii) provincial TVET implementation plans, \nincluding  proposals  for  six  provincial  campuses;  (iii)  an  organizational  structure  and \nimplementation arrangements for a sustainable TVET training fund; and (iv) the delivery of \nnonformal, income-oriented skills training using the pilot TVET training fund mechanism.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TVET master plan and the associated provincial TVET implementation plans will be \nprepared by key stakeholders with the support of a TVET policy advisor through a series of \nprovincial and national workshops and conferences. Senior government officials concerned with \n                                                 \n5 No new infrastructure will be required. Existing training facilities will be strengthened mainly through capacity \nbuilding for human resources, e.g., upgrading teachers, training headmasters/managers, to fulfill the role of a \nprovincial campus. These facilities will be the link between the formal and the nonformal TVET system.  ", "4  \nthe development of TVET and nongovernment stakeholders involved in delivering TVET will \nexamine various TVET models in the Asia Pacific region. A guided study tour will facilitate this \nprocess. The experiences and insights gained will be presented at the first of a series of \nnational conferences. The preparation of the provincial action plans will be facilitated by VNTC, \nVIT,  and  MTYD  through  a  series  of  provincial  stakeholder  workshops.  The  costing  of  the \nimplementation  of  the  provincial  implementation  plans,  and  the  selection  of  host  training \ninstitutions for the VIT provincial campuses form an integrated part of this participatory process. \nThe national conferences will focus (i) on the overall TVET master plan and the linkages with \nthe provincial implementation plans complementing REDI, and (ii) the organizational structure \nand  implementation  arrangements  for  the  training  fund.  Key  provincial  stakeholders  will \nparticipate in these conferences.  \n \n12.  The development of the organizational structure and implementation arrangements for a \nsustainable TVET training fund will be facilitated by an advisor on training fund operations. The \norganizational  structure  at  national  and  provincial  levels,  an  operational  manual,  and  the \nconstitution of the training fund will be developed with support from VNTC and finalized at a \nnational stakeholder workshop (para. 11). This funding mechanism will be pilot-tested during the \nsecond year of TA implementation with the start of the skills training (para. 13). The outreach \nand impact of training by nonformal training providers\u2013the direct beneficiaries of the training \nfund\u2013will be assessed. This will provide the basis for a  Government decision on whether to \nintroduce a larger training fund, which will use the accrued interest on the capital only, and by \ndoing so will have an unlimited operation period.6  \n \n13.  The delivery of nonformal, income-oriented skills training using the pilot TVET training \nfund mechanism will be achieved through (i) a series of technical training-of-trainer programs in \nthe  provinces,  designed  to  upgrade  the  technical  and  teaching  capacity  of  local  training \nproviders; (ii) a 1-month training7 program for one VNTC executive staff in applying costing, \nselecting,  and  monitoring  short-term  income-oriented  skills  training;  (iii)  a  national  training \nprogram  on  the  preparation  and  screening  of  training  proposals;  and  (iv)  the  provision  of \n$50,000 to fund, monitor, and evaluate short-term income-generating skills training. The TA will \nfund up to 70% of the total training costs.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n14.  The cost of the TA is estimated at $325,000 equivalent, of which $149,000 is the foreign \nexchange  cost  and  $176,000  equivalent  is  the  local  currency  cost.  The  Government  has \nrequested ADB to finance $250,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost and \n$101,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB's TA funding program. The Government will provide counterpart staff, transport, and office, \nworkshop, and communication facilities amounting to $60,000 equivalent in local currency, and \nthe training providers8 will contribute $15,000 equivalent in kind for skills training, amounting \ntogether to 30% of the total project cost. The TA will finance (i) international consulting services; \n(ii) one study tour for senior government officials and key TVET stakeholders; (iii) a series of \nprovincial workshops and national conferences; (iv) 1 month of training for a VNTC executive \n                                                 \n6 The Government of Papua New Guinea is operating a skills development fund using accrued interest only. It is a \nmodel for the type of sustainable funding mechanism Vanuatu intends to set up. The fund is supported by Loan  \n1706-PNG: Employment-Oriented Skills Development Project.  \n7 The training will be undertaken in Papua New Guinea in cooperation with the skills development trust fund. \n8 The selection criteria for training providers to participate in the TA and to share the cost of skills training are part of \nthe scope of the TA. The type of training providers can range from NGOs and church-based organizations to formal \ntraining institutions.  ", "    5 \nofficer in the operational procedures of the training fund; (v) a series of provincial training-the- \ntrainer workshops; and (vi) up to 200 skills training courses for school dropouts, unemployed \nyouth and women, particularly those in rural areas. Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 3.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The Department of Economic and Social Development (DESD) will be the Executing \nAgency of the TA. MTYD will be the Implementing Agency and will, in cooperation with VNTC \nand VIT, provide counterpart staff, office space, and transport and communication facilities. The \nteam of consultants will work under the overall guidance of the director general of education, \ntraining and youth development.9 The executive secretary of VNTC and the principal of VIT will \nwork on a day-to-day basis with the team of international consultants.  \n \n16.  The two international consultants will have specialization in (i) TVET policy, and  (ii) \ntraining fund operations. The consultants\u2019 terms of reference are in Appendix 4. The TA will be \nimplemented over a period of about 24 months (February 2003-January 2005). The assignment \nof the consultant for TVET policy (3 person-months) will be carried out in two phases: at the \nbeginning and at mid-point of the implementation period. During phase 1, the consultants will \nassist MTYD in preparing the first draft of the TVET master plan and guide the study tour for \nsenior government officials. Phase 2 will focus on the synthesis of the provincial implementation \nplans and the TVET master plan and the presentation of the final draft for approval by the \nVanuatu Council of Ministers.  The TVET policy consultant will submit (i) an interim progress \nreport upon completion of  phase 1 of the TA, and (ii) a draft final report in accordance with the \nterms of reference 2 weeks after the completion of  phase 2 of the TA. The international \nconsultant for training fund operations (1 person-month) will advise the Government on the \norganizational structure and operational procedures of the training fund and will prepare a draft \nfinal report within 2 weeks after completion of the assignment. The expected TA completion \ndate is January 2005. The individual consultants will be selected and engaged by ADB in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $250,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Vanuatu for the Policy Framework and Capacity Building for Technical and \nVocational Education and Training, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                 \n9 The positions of director general for MTYD and for MOE are merged and held by one person.
