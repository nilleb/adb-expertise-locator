The  Technical  Assistance  (TA)  aims  to  improve  sector  agencies\u2019  understanding  of \npractical applications of results-based management (RBM) systems. The concept paper for the \nTA was prepared by the Regional and Sustainable Development Department, Governance and \nRegional Cooperation Division (RSGR), and cleared by the governance and capacity-building \ncommittee in May 2002.1 The TA was endorsed by the knowledge management committee  \nmeeting in June 2002.2  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  In many Developing Member Countries (DMCs), improving the delivery of basic services \ncontinues to be a challenge. DMC sector agencies work in environments that have complex \nstrategic  frameworks,  such  as  national  poverty  reduction  strategies  and  millennium \ndevelopment goals, as well as challenging public administration demands such as medium-term \nexpenditure frameworks (MTEFs) and decentralization programs. Improved delivery of basic \nservices requires that these systems be simultaneously applied in institutional environments that \nare changing rapidly, fiscally constrained, and unevenly endowed with capacities to deal with \nradical modifications. RBM must be explored to see how far it can be used in a structured and \ncoordinated way to translate strategic and public administration frameworks into results that \nimpact on peoples\u2019 lives.  \n \n3.  Since the 1980s, funding agencies have encouraged sector agencies to adopt RBM, but \nfor external aid projects rather than the agencies themselves. A number of lessons are to be \nlearned  from  the  international  practice  and  experience  of  RBM,  as  documented  by  the \nOperations Evaluation Unit of the Organization of the Organization for Economic Cooperation \nand Development (OECD):  \n  \n(i)  RBM requires a fundamental paradigm shift in how sector agencies operate. Such a \nmajor change requires modifications in the business culture and processes, which \ncan only be achieved in the medium to long term, and is critically dependent on how \nquickly staff capacities can be built.  \n(ii)  RBM requires strong support and commitment from the highest levels of sector \nagency management. If RBM is to be integrated into institutional practices, then \nsenior  management  of  participating  agencies  must  provide  unequivocal  and \nsustained direction.  \n  \n4.  DMCs  have  only  recently  given  more  attention  to  agency-level  adoption  of  RBM.  \nBangladesh, Cambodia, Mongolia, and the Philippines are beginning to use RBM to formulate \nand evaluate policies, largely by adopting sector-wide approaches. In Cambodia, the first SWAp \nwas developed in the education sector through Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance in \n2001 and is being implemented. SWAps are applications of RBM in sector agencies, and \nimportant triggers for RBM reforms. SWAps emerged during the mid-1990s, initially in the health \nand  education  sectors,  in  response  to  popular  disaffection  with  poor  coordination;  vertical \nimbalances between higher and lower levels of authority in planning, financing, and delivering \nservices; and a chronic misallocation of resources. SWAps are based on the assumption that \nthe  sector  agency  takes  lead  responsibility  and  accountability  for  the  delivery  of  specified \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 17 September 2002. \n2 The concept paper, approved by the committee, was titled \u201cDeveloping a Methodology for Strengthening Sector \nPerformance,\u201d later slightly adjusted to better reflect the TA\u2019s purpose.  \n ", "2   \nmedium-term  sector  outcomes.  Performance  analyses  identify  the  policy,  institutional,  and \nfinancial constraints that hinder eventual outcomes. The sector program of investment and \nreform is built around addressing these constraints. So far, DMCs\u2019 experiences with RBM at the \nsector level are not well documented. \n \n5.  The TA will enable sector agencies to learn from experiences in RBM and promote its \nadoption. The experiences gained from implementing this TA will help DMC sector agencies \nstrengthen their sector focus and effectiveness, prepare sector road maps and demonstrate \nADB  operations\u2019  effectiveness.  The  TA  will  also  help  sector  agencies  implement  the \nrecommendations following from the ongoing ADB operations evaluations study on lessons \nlearned  from  project  performance  management  in  ADB  and  selected  DMCs.  The  TA  will \ncontribute to the effective use of the project performance management system in ADB and \nDMCs  (for  ADB-funded  projects).  The  TA  will  contribute  to  the  success  of  ADB's  country \nstrategies and programs (CSPs).  \n \n6.  The  ongoing  discussion  within  the  donor  community  on  the  effectiveness  of  aid3 \nemphasizes sustainable growth and poverty reduction. External aid allocation will soon be \nlinked to not only country performance but also sector performance. The policies and institutions \nadopted  by  sector  agencies,  particularly  those  responsible  for  basic  service  delivery,  are \nimportant in achieving sustainable growth and reducing poverty. Participating sector agencies \nwill thus be enabled to increase their access to donor funding generally and ADB funding \nspecifically. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Outputs \n7.  The TA will improve sector agencies\u2019 understanding and applications of RBM systems \nby  paying  special  attention  to  RBM  issues  arising  from  the  broader  context  of  public \nadministration reform. By supporting RBM reforms in service delivery sector agencies, the TA \nwill help improve basic service delivery (Appendix 1).  \n \n8.  Participating sector agencies will increase their emphasis on at least one element of \nRBM:  (i)  defining  strategic  performance  objectives;  (ii)  specifying  results  and  performance \nexpectations of stakeholders; (iii) establishing performance measurement systems, including a \ntransparent database for performance reporting; (iv) creating accountability for performance; \nand (v) promoting performance analysis for continuous improvement.  \n \n9.  The TA has four closely linked outputs: \n \na)  Provide opportunities to targeted sector agencies in at least two DMCs to (a) \nreview RBM experiences against RBM concepts and good practices in other DMCs, and \n(b) determine the focus and approach of diagnostic studies.  \n \nb)  Conduct a diagnostic analysis to identify the reasons for performance gaps that \nunderlie poor basic service delivery. The approach will emphasize how to address sector \nissues arising from public administration reform, requiring an in-depth analysis of sector \n                                                 \n3   World Bank. 2002.

Washington, DC.  \n \n ", "    3\nimpacts  of,  for  example,  MTEFs,  sector  policy  and  performance,  and  policy  and \nstructures for decentralization. \n \nc)   Develop  action  plans  to  prepare  or  improve  sector  road  maps.  Given  the \nimportance of leadership within a given agency, high-level workshops will be utilized to \npresent the results of the diagnostic studies and obtain directions for further steps, \nfollowed by working-level workshops.  \n \nd)   Facilitate cross-sectoral and cross-country learning to enable countries/sectors to \nlearn from good practices. For instance, cross-sectoral in-country workshops on topics of \ncommon concern (e.g., how to translate millennium development goals into performance \nindicators, etc.) will be held and information exchanged between the agencies.4  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n   \n10.  The TA is the first of a series of follow-up TAs to develop, test, and implement RBM for \nsector agencies. RSGR will try to ensure fund availability for the follow-up TAs.  \n \n11.  Given the TA\u2019s limited budget, the selection of participating DMCs and sector agencies \nis  critical  to  ensure  a  clear  focus  of  the  work.  The  screening  process  will  involve  sector \ncommittees; operational departments, particularly the resident missions; and RSGR. Selection \ncriteria will be (i) availability and access to adequate and up-to-date sector work on public \nadministration reform, e.g., decentralization programs, SWAps, MTEFs, etc.; (ii) amount of ADB \nresources programmed to support basic service delivery; (iii) readiness of sector agencies to \nadopt the approach, indicated by at least some initial RBM work; (iv) leverage the agency has to \nchange  decision-making  processes/leadership;  (v)  readiness  of  operational  departments, \nparticularly the resident missions, to support the TA by, for example, acting as a focal point for \nthe TA.  \n   \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The total TA cost is estimated at $310,000 equivalent, of which $188,000 will be in \nforeign  currency,  and  $122,000  in  local  currency  equivalent.  ADB  will  provide  a  grant  of \n$250,000 financed by the TA funding program. A detailed cost estimate is in Appendix 2. The \ngovernments  will  each  finance  $30,000  of  the  local  costs  by  providing  office  space, \nremuneration, and per diem of counterpart staff. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  RSGR will implement the TA in close coordination with resident missions, which will act \nas focal points. The TA will focus on education agencies in Cambodia and Mongolia. The TA \nmight  be  extended  to  other  DMCs  and  to  their  health  and  education  agencies  based  on \ndiscussions with governments. Consultants will only be engaged when agreement has been \nreached with two sector agencies in two DMCs.  \n \n                                                 \n4 Depending on whether the Asian Development Bank Institute's (ADBI) support can be ensured, an E-learning \nplatform will be designed in cooperation with and funded by ADBI along the lines of the program developed for \nPacific DMCs.  \n \n ", "4   \n14.  RSGR will actively implement the TA by coordinating the selection of DMCs and sector \nagencies; and contributing to workshops, case studies, and diagnostic analysis. RSGR will \ncoordinate the TA with the Operation Evaluation Department's special evaluation study on \nlessons learned from project performance management in ADB and selected DMCs. RSGR will \nalso link the TA with other ADB-supported initiatives being implemented with the targeted \nagencies. \n \n15.  The TA will require up to 6 person-months of international consultant services and up to \n18 person-months of domestic consultant services. All consultants will be engaged by ADB as \nindividuals in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. Outline terms of reference for \nthe consultants are in Appendix 3. The TA will involve educational and training institutions in the \nDMCs. \n \n16.  The experiences gained under the TA will be disseminated through the ADB governance \nwebsite and a publication to be titled \u201cRBM Reforms in Asia: Case Studies from a Sector \nAgency Perspective.\u201d  \n \n17.  As the process of organizational development will be highly inclusive and participatory, \nfrequent workshops, working-group meetings, and field trips to regional offices will be required.  \n   \n18.  The TA is intended to be the first phase (12 months) of a long-term process. By the end \nof the first phase, the two agencies will have increased their understanding of RBM, conducted \ndiagnostic studies to identify performance gaps, and developed road maps. Agencies involved \nin the TA will share their experiences with other DMC agencies working in similar fields of work.  \n  \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $250,000 on a grant basis for \npreparing  the  Strengthening  Results-Based  Management  for  Sector  Agencies,  and  hereby \nreports this action to the Board.    \n \n ", "  Appendix 1  5\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \n  \n       \n  Performance  Monitoring   Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Indicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \n     \n       \nGoal       \nImprove delivery of  Significant  In-country performance  The governments are \nbasic services   improvement in  measurement systems  committed to improve the \nquality and quantity  at local level  delivery of health and \nof services delivered  education services. \nin the next 10 years   \n       \nPurpose       \nImprove sector  Evidence of improved  DMC sector agency  Funds are available to \nagencies\u2019  understanding and  road maps and work  continue and sustain the \nunderstanding and  applications of RBM  plans;
