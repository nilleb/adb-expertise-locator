Since 1992, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been supporting the Greater \nMekong Subregion (GMS) Economic Cooperation Program to enhance cooperation between  \nCambodia,  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (PDR),  Myanmar,  Thailand,  Viet  Nam,  and  \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). During the fifth meeting of the GMS Human Resource \nDevelopment working  group  on  16\u201317  June  2004  in  Yangoon,  participants  confirmed  that \ncommunicable diseases control (CDC) is a top priority for regional collaboration in view of \nemerging  diseases  such  as  human  immunodeficiency  virus/acquired  immunodeficiency \nsyndrome (HIV/AIDS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), along with endemic \ncommunicable diseases like diarrheal diseases, malaria, measles, and tuberculosis.   \n \n2.  As a first phase, a project is proposed for regional CDC in Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet \nNam, which will also facilitate collaboration with other GMS countries. Accordingly, ADB\u2019s GMS \nprogram includes a regional CDC project of $30 million in grant or loan.1 ADB and the World \nHealth Organization/Western Pacific Regional Office2 (WHO/WPRO) have been developing \npartnership in CDC through various small projects3 and want to strengthen this further.4 A joint \nADB-WHO/WPRO project preparatory technical assistance (TA) Fact-Finding Mission carried \nout regional consultations and visited Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam to develop the project \nconcept with government representatives and external agencies.5  ADB, WHO/WPRO and the \nGovernments of Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam have agreed on the overall objectives, \nscope,  cost  estimates  and  financing  plan,  implementation  arrangements,  and  consulting \nservices,  as  documented  in  signed  Memoranda  of  Understanding.  The  indicative  project \nframework is in Appendix 1.      \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Achieving Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).  At the Yangoon meeting, the \ncountries demonstrated their progress and commitment to achieving the MDGs by 2015. CDC \ndirectly relates to half the MDGs\u2014reducing child and maternal mortality and malnutrition, and \ncontaining and beginning to reverse the trend of HIV/AIDS and other communicable diseases. \nThus, achieving these MDGs in the Mekong will, to a large extent, depend on progress in CDC.   \n \n4.  Socioeconomic Transition.  The three countries, with a per capita income of less than \n$450 per year and about one third of the population living in poverty, are  undergoing rapid \neconomic expansion. Road construction is improving regional and local connectivity, opening up \nnew areas and creating employment. Settlements along these roads attract entrepreneurs and \nmigrant laborers.  Immigration and  trade agreements stimulate the flow of people and goods \nbetween countries. Tourism promotion and increased wealth  encourage regional travel and \ndemand for services. These economic developments accelerate social change and are likely to \nhave both positive and negative impacts on health. If unchecked, communicable diseases will \n                                                 \n1  The provisional distribution is $9 million to Cambodia, $6 million to the Lao PDR, and $15 million to Viet Nam.   \n2  WHO/WPRO, based in Manila, covers Cambodia, Lao PDR, Viet Nam, and People\u2019s Republic of China.

Palmer and C. Beaver of  WHO/WPRO. \n5  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 14 April 2004. \n ", "2     \n \nconstrict the regional economy and social development.6 On the other hand, effective CDC will \nnot  only  help  achieve  the  health-related  MDGs,  but  also  contribute  toward  economic \nproductivity, better learning in school, and poverty reduction.    \n  \n5.  Multiple  Challenges.  The  governments  in  the  region  have  to  address  multiple \nchallenges to CDC. They need to deal with a high burden of endemic diseases like diarrheal \ndiseases  and  acute  respiratory  infections  causing  the  highest  child  mortality,  and  expand \ncoverage of vaccination and control of tuberculosis and malaria to remote populations not \nreached so far. They also need to provide a coordinated response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic to \ncontain its spread among high-risk groups. Governments need to track and quickly respond to \nemerging epidemics like SARS and avian influenza. CDC will also require sound management. \nParticipants  at  the  Yangoon  conference  identified  harmonizing  CDC  programs,  improving \nsurveillance  systems,  CDC  for  remote  populations,  and  HIV/AIDS  prevention  as  regional \npriorities.      \n \n6.  Communicable  Diseases  Control  Coordination.  Reducing  the  prevalence  of \ncommunicable  diseases  across  the  region  will  require  harmonization  of  CDC  efforts  and \ncapacity building for health systems, by learning what works and doesn\u2019t work, developing \ncommon  strategies  and  standards,  staff  development,  and  coordinated  action.  Regional \nnetworking and institutional collaboration will need to be intensified. One particular area of \nconcern is the quality of medicines for CDC. Poor quality drugs and inappropriate use of drugs \nresult in ineffective treatment and drug resistance.  \n \n7.  Emerging Epidemics. SARS and avian influenza epidemics as seen during 2003\u20132004 \ncan have a major economic impact on the region in terms of loss of tourism, export, and \ninvestment. The multiple surveillance systems currently operating are either limited in coverage \nor slow, and lack integration. The outbreaks clearly showed weaknesses in preparedness, \nsurveillance, and response; and delays in intercountry coordination. Controlling these outbreaks \nwill require strong coordination from community to global levels. ADB and WHO are currently \nreviewing surveillance systems in the region (footnote 3). The new WHO International Health \nRegulations  (IHR),  to  become  effective  in  2006,  will  provide  the  global  framework  for \nsurveillance, and will require considerable regional capacity building. Each country will need to \nmake substantial efforts in upgrading and streamlining existing surveillance systems, including \nreporting and diagnostic capacity, and building a strong emergency response capacity.     \n \n8.  Endemic Diseases. Poor people living in remote areas including mountains, jungles \nand border areas\u2014many of whom are ethnic minorities\u2014suffer most from common endemic \ninfections that cause high levels of child mortality and malnutrition. Among these are diarrheal \ndiseases, acute respiratory infections, malaria, measles, hepatitis, tuberculosis, and parasitic \ninfections. Simple, highly cost-effective preventive and curative interventions are available for \nthese conditions. However, public  funding for primary care and child survival programs is \ninadequate, and local public health systems have limited capacity to reach remote populations. \nReaching  these  populations  to  achieve  MDGs  will  require  innovative  strategies  such  as \nmultipurpose outreach workers and community-based programs that need to be explored.   \n \n9.  HIV/AIDS.  Within  GMS,  Cambodia,  Myanmar,  and  Thailand  have  a  generalized \nepidemic,  defined  as  having  HIV  prevalence  of  more  than  1%  among  pregnant  women. \n                                                 \n6  ADB/UNAIDS. 2004. Asia Pacific\u2019s Opportunity: Investing to Avert an HIV Crisis. Manila. Estimated economic loss \ndue to HIV in Asia and Pacific totaled $7.3 billion in 2001.  ", "      3   \nCambodia and Thailand have managed to reduce HIV prevalence, but are still at risk of \nescalation. Viet Nam and PRC\u2019s southern provinces have concentrated epidemics (prevalence \nof  more  than  5%  among  drug  users  and  sex  workers).  The  Lao  PDR  still  has  low  HIV \nprevalence, but is  surrounded by countries with much higher HIV prevalence. The Mekong \nHIV/AIDS epidemic at this stage is largely driven by injecting drug users (IDUs) who pass it on \nto sex workers, their clients, partners, and children. Blood products and infected needles are \nother  sources  of  HIV  infections\u2014and  other  pathogens  like  Hepatitis  B  virus.  HIV/AIDS  is \nspreading  among  migrant  and  mobile  people,  ethnic  minorities  living  along  new  transport \ncorridors,  and  youth  due  to  high-risk behavior associated with wealth, poverty, and social \nchanges. Despite major funding going into HIV/AIDS control, there is a paucity of funds for \nHIV/AIDS prevention, such as for promoting condom use among sex workers, reducing harm  \namong IDUs, and preventing mother to child HIV transmission.7  \n \n10.  Regional Approach.  Regional coordination for CDC has a  strong rationale. Cross-\nborder migrant workers may not have access to CDC, are exposed to social pressure and urban \nenvironments, and face periodic unemployment without family support systems.8 New markets \nalong roads and borders increase exposure of traditional communities to mobile people, but \nalso expose settlers and those in transit to endemic diseases such as malaria. Ethnic minorities \nliving across borders share similar languages and practices, requiring special strategies to \nreach  them.  CDC  strategies  need  harmonization  through  regional  networking.  Exchanging \nexperiences can also strengthen commitment and improve efforts for CDC at the national level. \nCDC will also benefit from standardizing products and services across borders, and improve \nquality control. Developing those areas will require institutional strengthening and technology \ntransfer that would benefit from using regional policy analysis and research capacity. The need \nfor  strengthening  regional  surveillance,  response  capacity,  and  information  exchange  has \nbecome evident with the SARS and avian flu epidemics. Rather than relying on overseas \nassistance, the region needs to develop its own capacity to deal with epidemics.  \n \n11.  Opportunities. The current setting is favorable for developing regional collaboration in \nCDC. Recent epidemics have created a political will to exchange information on CDC, impose \nquality  standards,  and  learn  from  each  other.  In  2003,  six  ministers  of  health  signed  an \nagreement to share information on CDC surveillance. Progress in the Association of Southeast \nAsian Nations (ASEAN) and GMS have created strong regional frameworks for collaboration. \nThe new IHR of WHO give a further boost to improving surveillance systems.    \n \n12.  Lessons  Learned.  ADB\u2019s  regional  CDC  projects  (footnote  3)  and  national  health \nprojects9 have generally done well, driven by strong national commitments to improve the health \nof the poor. However, capacity constraints have caused initial delays in project implementation. \nRegional  and  national  coordination  has  been  satisfactory,  but  community-based activities \nproved more challenging.      \n \n                                                 \n7   Antiretroviral drugs can reduce mother to child HIV transmission from above 30% to below 5%. \n8  For example, discontinuing the preferential trade agreement for Cambodia\u2019s garment industry would lead to \nthousands of young women in Phnom Penh becoming unemployed.  \n9   Ongoing projects are ADB. 2002.

The TA will help (i) assess CDC efforts in Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam in the \ncontext of the GMS; (ii) identify priorities for, and feasibility of strengthening CDC programs and \ncoordination; and (iii) prepare a project proposal based on these priorities.    \n \n14.  The Project will support MDGs of reducing child and maternal mortality, and containing \nand beginning to reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS and communicable diseases by reducing the \nburden  of  common  communicable  diseases  in  vulnerable  populations,  particularly  among \nwomen and children; and reducing the economic cost of endemic diseases and emerging \nepidemics. The objectives would broadly be to (i) improve regional CDC coordination; (ii) ensure \ntimely and appropriate control of epidemics that are likely to have a major impact on public \nhealth and the economy; (iii) reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS in high-risk populations; and (iv) \nreduce the burden of endemic infectious diseases of remote populations, including in border \nareas.   \n \n15.  The scope of the Project will be determined during the TA. The indicative project \ncomponents are (i) harmonizing and advocating CDC strategies, quality standards, and services \nthrough  regional  networking  and  institutional  collaboration;  (ii)  strengthening  surveillance \nsystems and implementation of WHO IHR; (iii)  preventing HIV/AIDS in high-risk populations; \nand (iv) developing district-wide integrated CDC systems for remote populations.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n16.  The  consulting  team  will  conduct  local,  national,  and  regional  consultations;  and \nparticipatory planning with stakeholders and beneficiaries for the situation analysis and design \nof components. The team leader will coordinate with the agencies concerned, provide technical \nguidance, coordinate consultants and TA work, and prepare reports. A health policy expert will \nexamine challenges and opportunities for strengthening and streamlining CDC in the region. A \nsurveillance  expert  will  review  surveillance  and  health  management  information  systems \nincluding  those  of  vertical  programs,  their  funding  source  and  sustainability,  capacity  and \nperformance, and potential for improvement. This will be followed by a regional discussion to \nidentify priorities to strengthen surveillance systems, feasibility, and issues of various designs. A \npublic health expert and a social development expert will review current CDC programs for \nvulnerable  populations,  their  coverage  and  funding,  and  identify  priorities  based  on  cost-\neffectiveness and other criteria. The social development expert will prepare the poverty analysis \n(Appendix 2), the public health expert the environmental assessment, and the health economist \nthe economic analysis, including the rationale for a regional project.    \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $800,000 equivalent. ADB will provide $600,000 \nequivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the \nGovernment of Japan. WHO will provide $150,000 equivalent in kind. The three governments \nwill provide $50,000 equivalent in kind\u2014$25,000 from Viet Nam, $15,000 from Cambodia, and \n$10,000 from the Lao PDR\u2014of the local currency cost. The cost estimates and financing plan \nare in Appendix 3. The Governments have been advised that approval of the TA does not \ncommit ADB to finance any ensuing project.  \n ", "      5   \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  ADB (Mekong Department Social Sectors Division) will be the Executing Agency for the \nTA. WHO will provide technical guidance. A regional steering committee will be established \nconsisting of representatives of governments of the participating countries, ADB, and WHO. The \ncommittee  will  guide  the  TA  through  three  regional  meetings  at  inception,  midterm,  and \ncompletion of the draft final report. At the national level, a subcommittee chaired by a senior \ngovernment  representative  with  membership  from  the  concerned  departments,  the  ADB \nresident mission, and the WHO country office, will guide national planning activities.  \n \n19.  ADB will establish and manage a regional coordination unit (RCU) in Hanoi for the \npurpose of implementing the TA. The international consultants will work from this base. The \nRCU will be responsible for regional coordination of the TA, including liaison with stakeholders; \ndata  collection  and  analysis;  support  of  consultants;  provision  of  logistic  support;  and \norganization of workshops. At the national level, each Ministry of Health (MOH) will identify a \ndepartment as the focal point for coordinating TA work, and nominate a full-time government \nstaff member, supplemented with one project research assistant, to help implement the TA. \nEach WHO country office will identify a resource person to assist MOH and RCU with TA \nimplementation. A participatory planning process will be followed for analyzing and planning \neach subcomponent.            \n \n20.  ADB will finance a total of 18 person-months (number of person-months enclosed in \nparentheses) of international consulting services, including a team leader-public health expert \n(6),  a  health  economist  (5),  a  social  development-HIV/AIDS  education  expert  (5),  and  a \nsurveillance expert (2). WHO/WPRO will provide a CDC policy expert (2) on part-time basis, \nand three domestic public health experts (18 total) for this TA. ADB consultants will be engaged \nas individual consultants by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \nand other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. The indicative \nterms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 4. Any equipment and supplies financed by \nADB will be procured under the TA in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. On \ncompletion of the TA, acquired equipment will be transferred to the project office.   \n21.  Within 6 weeks of the start of the TA, the RCU will submit an inception report discussing \nthe findings of the first consultants, outputs, methodology, and work schedule. The sector \nanalysis will be submitted at midterm, the draft final report 2 weeks before completion of the TA, \nand the final report within 2 weeks after completion of the TA, for approval of the steering \ncommittee. The TA will start in October 2004 and will be completed by April 2005.    \n   \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Governments of

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, \nand Viet Nam: Communicable diseases pose major human and economic burdens on families living in isolated areas, \nmany of them ethnic minorities lacking access to public or private health systems. Medical expenses constitute a \nmajor share of household expenditures, particularly for the poor. As a result of frequent and serious illnesses, many \nhouseholds end up in poverty, have to sell their assets, and send family members, often young persons, out as \nmigrant laborers, exposing them to new health risks with little preparation. The roads that are being constructed in the \nregion have opened up remote areas in these countries, drawing in local people and enabling the spread of human \nimmunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) \namong them. The sector will need to make major efforts to reach these poor people and help them protect themselves \nfrom endemic and emerging communicable diseases.      \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                  Proposed Poverty Classification: Poverty intervention1 \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  The Project will target remote living communities, many of them ethnic \nminorities and high-risk populations for HIV/AIDS. The analysis will include an assessment of health status, priorities, \nservices and issues for the poor, including major ethnic minorities, compared with other populations. The analysis will \nalso look at distributional impact and the  effects of the high cost of health care on the poor.  To reach remote \npopulations, the Project will  analyze alternative strategies that will make services affordable and acceptable, of \nadequate quality, and locally sustainable within the scope of government and community resources.  Similarly, for the \nhigh-risk populations, including sex workers and drug users, special strategies will need to be developed to reach \nthem, secure their trust and participation, and engage them through behavioral change programs and targeted \nservices. The poverty analysis will also need to assess the potential benefits, issues and constraints of the Project, \nand ensure that the investments are benefiting the poor and disadvantaged groups most. \n  \nC.
