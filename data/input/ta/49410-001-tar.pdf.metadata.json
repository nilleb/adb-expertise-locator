INTRODUCTION \n1.  The proposed regional capacity development technical assistance (TA) follows on from \nand  builds  upon  the  successful  implementation  of  the  TA  for  Promoting  Gender-Inclusive \nGrowth in Central and West Asia Developing Member Countries (DMCs), which is scheduled to \nbe completed in March 2016.1 Although that TA is likely to be rated highly successful, it is based \non a problem analysis and the related design from 2009, which is now outdated. This TA will (i) \nbuild on the successes of the TA on Promoting Gender-Inclusive Growth in Central and West \nAsia DMCs; (ii) realign gender approaches with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) \nagreed in 2015 as well as emerging issues and opportunities in the region; and (iii) assist all 10 \nDMCs in Central and West Asia (CWA) to inform and strengthen, from a gender perspective, \nthe design, performance, and evaluation of projects financed by the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB). \n \n2.  This TA was developed through the experience of implementing, as well as leveraging, \nthe existing gender and development (GAD) networks established in each participating member \ncountry under the TA on Promoting Gender-Inclusive Growth in Central and West Asia DMCs. \nIn this way, access to government representatives, partners from United Nations agencies, \nbilateral and multilateral development organizations, and civil society to discuss key issues \nsurrounding gender-inclusive growth has informed the development of this TA. In particular, the \nfinal  workshop  of  the  previous  TA,  which  was  held  in  October  2015  and  attended  by \nrepresentatives from all 10 DMCs in CWA, identified emerging and persistent gender issues, \nnational priorities, and new opportunities in the region. Government partners expressed support \nand indicated the continued need for ADB\u2019s work in the thematic area of gender. The design of \nthis TA has been informed by (i) feedback provided by ADB\u2019s regional network of gender \nspecialists,  focal  points,  sector  specialists,  and  country  directors  about  recommended \napproaches, events, and activities; (ii) consultations with development partners; (iii) ADB staff \nexperience in developing and delivering gender mainstreaming activities through investments in \npublic sector finance and social protection, and the education, transportation, energy, urban, \nand  water  sectors  in  the  region;  and  (iv)  good  practices  internationally.  Government \nconcurrence with the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1) will be obtained from each \nDMC prior to TA effectiveness, and no activity will be financed or undertaken in any participating \nDMC until government concurrence is received.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Although most DMCs in CWA have nearly achieved their education and literacy targets, \nkey gender gaps remain, which impact the extent to which women and girls benefit from growth, \nexacerbating inequality. Labor markets in the region are vertically and horizontally segregated, \nmeaning professional women are concentrated in sectors considered more suitable for women \n(such as education or health), which pay lower wages. Women are overrepresented in the rural \nand agriculture sectors and the informal economy, and they have limited access to social \nprotection. When  employed  in  industry,  women  are  underrepresented in  management  and \n                                                \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2010. Promoting Gender-Inclusive Growth in Central and West Asia Developing \nMember Countries. Manila (TA 7563-REG). This TA was approved for $0.75 million and received subsequent \nfunds to finally total $4.5 million. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 11 December 2015.  \n ", "2   \ntechnical positions. While labor force participation rates are nearly equal in many DMCs, female \nunemployment outstrips that of men3.  \n \n4.  Women also remain predominantly responsible for unpaid domestic and care work, \nwhich is time-consuming and compounded by substandard infrastructure such as limited water \nsupply, sanitation, or electricity. As a result, women often lack the time to pursue paid work, \nparticipate in community governance, or further their skills and education.  \n \n5.  Violence  against  women  (domestic  violence,  harassment  in  public,  restrictions  on \nmobility, discrimination, or the \u201cmissing girls phenomenon\u201d)4 is also prevalent in the region. The \ncosts  of  gender-based  violence  are  felt  not  just  by  individuals  (in  the  form  of  direct  and \nopportunity costs) and families, but also communities and economies, in terms of additional \nhealth costs, the absence of women in the labor force and the governance costs of criminal, \njudicial, and support systems that could be reapplied to productive sectors. Climate change and \ndisaster risks will also impact the region, with women and men facing different challenges and \npossessing differing capacities for resilience due to their gender roles and responsibilities. \n \n6.   The ADB Central and West Asia Department has a high annual level of new project \ninvestments classified as \u201ceffective gender mainstreaming (EGM)\u201d (46% of approved projects in \n2015). However the capacity of governments (through project management units) to implement \ngender  action  plans  is  weak  (only  33%  of  investments  classified  as  EGM  delivered  their \nintended gender equality results in the year ending 2014). The mid-term review of ADB\u2019s \nStrategy 20205 noted that despite increased quality of project gender action plans, \u201cboth the \nimplementation of these plans and ADB\u2019s capacity to monitor and capture gender equity results \nremained weak\u201d. The subject TA will enable ADB to better work with DMCs to improve in these \nareas, as well as address the gender gaps noted above. \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n6.  The types of gender gaps, and the most relevant entry points for gender mainstreaming \nin each ADB investment, are unique in each DMC. This is reflected in the wide range of Gender \nInequality  Index  scores  in  the  region,  which  range  from  0.323  in  Kazakhstan  to  0.705  in \nAfghanistan.6 As such, resources are required for analysis, women\u2019s participation, formulation of \ncountry  and  sector-specific  approaches,  and  provision  of  capacity  building  assistance  to \ngovernment implementation in the thematic area of gender to ensure inclusive growth. The TA \nwill provide DMC capacity support for gender mainstreaming to (i) strengthen incorporation of \nsocial and gender perspectives in the ADB portfolio, (ii) assist in identifying entry points for \neffective gender mainstreaming, (iii) assist sector specialists to better develop and implement \ngender-sensitive  approaches  in  investment  projects  and  programs,  and  (iv)  participate  in \ncountry-level networks related to gender and social inclusion. \n \n7.  The  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs)  have  served  as  the  prevailing  global \ndevelopment framework since 2000. MDG 3 seeks to promote gender equality and empower \n                                                \n3 Female unemployment (as a % of females aged 15-64) in the region ranges from 4.9% in Kazakhstan to 18.8% in \nArmenia, compared with a range of 3.2% to 15.8% in the same countries for men.

The SDGs7, the successor to the MDGs, will drive the global development agenda \nduring 2015\u20132030. The SDGs use more powerful language and are more ambitious in both \nnumber and intended outcome than the MDGs.8 \n \n8.  To achieve SDG 5 (\u201cAchieve gender equality and empower all women and girls\u201d), DMCs \nmust (i) end discrimination against women and girls everywhere;  (ii) eliminate all forms of \nviolence against all women and girls in the public and private spheres; (iii) eliminate all harmful \npractices (including child, early, and forced marriage); (iv) recognize and value unpaid care and \ndomestic work through provision of public services, infrastructure, and social protection policies; \n(v) ensure women\u2019s full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership at all \nlevels of decision making in political, economic, and public life; (vi) ensure universal access to \nsexual and reproductive health services and rights; (vii) undertake reforms to give women equal \nrights to economic resources (including ownership and control over land and other property, \nfinancial  services,  inheritance,  and  natural  resources);  (viii)  enhance  the  use  of  enabling \ntechnologies to promote the empowerment of women; and (ix) adopt and strengthen sound \npolicies and enforceable legislation for the promotion of gender equality and the empowerment \nof all women and girls at all levels. This TA will help DMCs in CWA meet the SDG 5 targets. It \nwill also help CWA DMCs implement GAD activities in support of countries\u2019 national policies and \ninternational commitments on GAD in ADB-financed investment programs. \n \n9.  All CWA country partnership strategies include gender as a key cross-cutting theme. \nCentral Asia Regional Economic Cooperation 2020, the regional strategy for CWA, is anchored \nto four key areas of cooperation: transport, trade facilitation, trade policy, and energy.9 Projects \nunder  these  areas  tend  to  be  large  and  have  difficulty  mainstreaming  gender-responsive \napproaches. Additionally, the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Comprehensive \nAction Plan is silent on both gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment. This TA will help meet \nADB\u2019s wider policies10 on inclusive growth, gender, and development in the region.  \n \n10.  Without capturing and unleashing the talents, human capital, and economic potential of \nwomen and girls, who constitute half of Asia\u2019s population, the goal of a region free of poverty will \nnot be realized. This is stated clearly in ADB\u2019s Gender Equality and Women\u2019s Empowerment \nOperational Plan, 2013\u20132020, which (i) describes gender mainstreaming as the key strategy to \npromote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment across the full range of ADB operations, \nand  (ii)  promotes  the  use  of  pilot  projects  to  demonstrate  new  approaches  for  gender \nmainstreaming and to foster innovation.11  \n \n                                                \n7  United Nations.

The impact will be the attainment of gender-inclusive growth in participating DMCs. The \noutcome will be improved capacity of participating DMCs in gender mainstreaming. The TA\u2019s \noutcome target is that at least 50% of ADB-financed projects with gender mainstreaming in the \nCWA region deliver their intended gender equality results by the end of 2018.12  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  Outputs are as follows: \n(i)  Relevant  country-level  gender  information  will  be  produced. This  will  include \ncountry-, sector-, and thematic-level gender analysis and knowledge work to \ninform country partnership strategies and ADB investments. Selected knowledge \npartnerships will be explored with regional and national organizations working in \nthe thematic area of gender. \n(ii)  Gender  mainstreaming  approaches  will  be  modeled.  These  will  include  the \nconduct  of  10  pilot  projects  to  explore  new  and  emerging  practices  and \nmethodologies to  (a) enhance gender outcomes in relevant sectors; and (b) \ndemonstrate strategies, tools, and approaches for scaling up or integrating in \nsector projects and programs. \n(iii)  The  operational  environment  for  gender  mainstreaming  in  each  participating \nDMC will be strengthened. This will include the provision of (a) gender specialists, \nwho will work from each ADB resident mission (with the exception of Uzbekistan, \nwhich has a national officer for gender) to work with ADB staff, and (b) executing \nand  implementing  agencies  throughout  the  country  planning  and  investment \nproject cycle to support the effective gender mainstreaming of  all work. The \ngender specialists will also (a) oversee the implementation quality of projects with \na gender action plan, providing high-level capacity advice to project management \nunits; and (b) participate in country-level GAD networks, including identifying joint \nactivities with partner organizations for the promotion of gender equality results. \n \n13.  Together, these outputs and their associated activities will help guide ADB investments \nso they contain relevant designs to promote distribution of benefits to women and girls and \nprevent the creation or widening of gender gaps. Knowledge work and participation in national \nGAD networks will help make ADB\u2019s work relevant to existing and emerging issues in each \nCWA DMC. Provision of capacity building assistance to project implementation professionals \nwill increase the likelihood of anticipated gender results being realized in each CWA DMC. \nSuccess of the TA will depend on recruiting skilled consultants.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.   The TA is estimated to cost $1,500,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The TA will be implemented from April 2016 until March 2018. ADB will be the executing \nagency. CWRD\u2019s Portfolio, Results, Safeguards and Social Sector Unit will be responsible for \nthe overall administration and supervision of the TA, and will engage consultants and coordinate \n                                                \n12  The baseline for the end of 2014 is 33%. \n ", "  5 \nwith implementation partners. CWRD will be accountable for the delivery of the TA\u2019s outputs. \nPartner international organizations and nongovernment organizations will be determined during \nTA implementation. \n \n16.  The TA will require the services of one international consultant (24 person-months) and \nfive  national  consultants  (120  person-months).  The  international  consultant  will  oversee \nactivities in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan, and will assist with \noverall  regional  issues and/or studies,  capacity  development  support, and  preparation  and \ndissemination of information. A total of four national consultants (24 person-months each) will \nbe  engaged  in  Afghanistan,  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Pakistan,  and  Tajikistan.  One  national \nconsultant (24 person-months) will be hired to help coordinate implementation and supervision \nof the TA. Terms of reference for the consultants are provided in Appendix 3. The consultants \nwill be recruited by ADB using the individual consultant selection method, in accordance with \nthe Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). To expedite \nconsultant mobilization, advance contracting procedure will be followed.  \n \n17.    Under the TA, it is expected that consulting firms or nongovernment organizations will be \nengaged for pilot activities in each DMC. As the value of each contract is expected to be less \nthan $100,000, recruitment will be done using consultant qualification selection, in accordance \nwith the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The first two pilot projects have already been \nidentified to be carried out by the following organizations: Center for Entrepreneurship and \nExecutive Development (CEED) (for $15,000) in Armenia and ACTED (for $80,000) in Pakistan. \nGiven the small size of the contract for Armenia and the unique nature of the services CEED \ncan provide in Armenia, single-source selection will be requested. Information related to both \norganizations is in Supplementary Appendix A. Output-based contracts will be utilized wherever \npossible for pilot projects. Under output 1, potential partner organizations will be determined \nbased on their appropriate experience and track record, and with reference to ADB\u2019s integrity \ndue diligence. \n \n18.  Materials and equipment under the TA will be procured following ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  including  materials  and  equipment  \npurchased by consultants, who will use shopping procedures. Disbursement will be done in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time).  \n \n19.  The TA will use different methods to disseminate information, including social media, \nworkshops,  reports,  and  knowledge  products.  Consultants  will  provide  quarterly  reports.  A \nmidterm review mission will be held after the first year of the TA. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,500,000 on a grant basis \nfor Strengthening Gender-Inclusive Growth in Central and West Asia, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the TA is Aligned with: \nGender-inclusive growth is attained in participating DMCsa  \n  Performance Indicators  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  with Targets and Baselines  Reporting  Risks \nOutcome       \nImproved capacity of  At least 50% of ADB- Sustainable   \nparticipating DMCs in  financed projects with  Development and \ngender  gender mainstreaming in  Climate Change \nmainstreaming  the Central and West Asia  Department year-end \nregion deliver their  assessments of gender \nintended gender equality  results from project \nresults by the end of 2018  completion reports \n(2014 baseline: 33%) \nOutputs       \n1.
