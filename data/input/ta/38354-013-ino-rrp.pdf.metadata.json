I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of Indonesia for the State Accountability Revitalization Project.1  \n \n2.  The project aims to support key government reform priorities to improve government \naccountability by increasing the capacity of central and regional internal auditors and public \nfinance officers. It focuses on (i) providing incentives to auditors and finance officers to improve \ntheir capacity, (ii) improving trainer capacity, and (iii) implementing the e-learning and state \naccountability management information system (SIMA). This will improve governance in public \nfinancial management (PFM) and public service delivery for the benefit of Indonesian citizens. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.   Over the last decade, the government has placed a high priority on strengthening \ngovernance in public sector management and public service delivery. The Asian Development \nBank (ADB) risk assessment for Indonesia shows the government made considerable progress \nwith the legal and regulatory framework for PFM. In particular, most implementing regulations \nsupporting the main PFM laws, i.e., laws on state finance, treasury, and audit, have been \npromulgated.  Transparency,  accountability,  and  efficiency  are  key  pillars  of  PFM  and \nprocurement-related  reforms.  This  reflects  the  government\u2019s  priority  to  build  effective  and \naccountable  institutions  to  use  available  resources  to  translate  into  more  effective \ndevelopment.2 The country\u2019s effectiveness in providing goods and services has been improving. \nMost notably in 2009, for the first time, the Supreme Audit Board (BPK) gave a qualified (clean \nwith exceptions) 3 opinion on the government\u2019s financial statement, as opposed to a previous \ndisclaimer. Furthermore, about 40% of the line ministries and agencies received an unqualified \nopinion.  \n \n4.   To maintain momentum, the government has set an ambitious target for achieving \nunqualified audit opinions for all central government agencies by 2014. Progress has been \nmade, particularly in the area of budget execution, with the development of a treasury single \naccount  to  strengthen  the  comprehensiveness  and  control  over  spending  and  cash \nmanagement. Improvements were also made in fiscal accounts, accounting practices, payroll \nand internal controls, and fiscal risk management. However, some indicators remain behind \ncomparator economies in Southeast Asia.4 Further improvements are needed to achieve good \ngovernance  to  improve  the  quality  of  services  to  the  population, i.e.,  economical,  speedy, \ntransparent,  and  accountable  as  defined  in  Indonesia\u2019s  long-term  development  plan.5 The \ngovernment  has  implemented  the  control  framework  of  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring \nOrganizations and strengthened the government\u2019s internal audit function. \n \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  World Bank. 2008. Investing in Indonesia\u2019s Institutions: Country Partnership Strategy for Republic of Indonesia \n2009\u20132012. Washington, DC. \n3  BPK\u2019s  classification  of  audit  opinions,  from  strongest  to  weakest  is  as  follows:  unqualified  (clean  without \nexceptions), qualified (clean with exceptions), adverse, and disclaimer. \n4  ADB. 2010. Indonesia: Critical Development Constraints. Manila \n5  Government of Indonesia. 2007. National Long-Term Development Plan of 2005\u20132025 or Rencana Pembangunan \nJangka Panjang (RPJP). Jakarta. ", "2 \n5.  Despite significant progress, ADB\u2019s sector assessment on public sector management in \nIndonesia  identifies  lack  of  adequate  capacity  in  public  audit  institutions,  especially  local \ninstitutions, which negatively affects the performance of the government\u2019s audit institutions.6 \nCoordination among regional agencies is weak, and no uniform audit planning framework is in \nplace. Although the government regulation (PP) 60/2008 clarified the delineation of external and \ninternal audit functions, audit institutions, particularly regional internal auditors, have insufficient \ncapacity. The regulation requires all government institutions, including local governments, to \nimplement the Government Internal Control System (GICS). Under the regulation, the Central \nGovernment Internal Auditors (BPKP) is mandated to ensure the quality of internal audit reports \nand to provide guidance and consultancy on the GICS. Thus, the capacity of internal auditors \nneeds to be improved through formal education and a professional certification program. In \naddition,  government  officials  involved  in  financial  management,  budgeting,  planning,  and \nfinancial reporting require capacity development to ensure that auditors and auditees have \ncommon knowledge and standards. The quality of audit by inspectors general in line ministries \nand local government inspectorates remains substandard with little focus on risk-based audit. A \nrecent mapping process on the capacity of the government internal audit function in Indonesia, \nbased on the internal audit capability model developed by the Institute of Internal Auditors, \nrevealed  that  93%  of  the  respondents  (25  inspectors  general  and  237  local  government \ninspectorates)  reported  that  (i) transactional  audits  were  conducted  for  accuracy  and \ncompliance only, (ii) audit plans were not prepared based on stakeholder priorities, and (iii) audit \noutput was based on the capacity of certain individuals. \n \n6.  The  country\u2019s  decentralization  process  (starting  in  2000)  transferred  more  than  30 \nfunctions and 2 million civil servants from the central to subnational governments. However, the \nnew intergovernment setting inherited a large administrative and institutional burden, a multitude \nof public agencies, lack of professional civil servants, uncertified accountants, weak public \nmanagement  systems,  graft,  and  corruption.  The  latest  data  of  the  State  Ministry  for \nAdministrative Reforms (2008) shows that 50% of Indonesia's 4 million civil servants were not \nsufficiently qualified. Latest data from BPKP shows that Papua and West Papua provinces have \nno  government  internal  auditors.  Lack  of  capacity  limits  effective  PFM  and  influences \ngovernance  by  regional  governments.  In  2010,  only  7%  of  the  516  regional  governments \nreceived an unqualified (clean without exceptions) audit opinion for their financial statements. \n \n7.  Other factors weaken regional PFM. First, decentralization resulted in more civil servants \nin regional governments, which translated into more of the budget being spent on salaries, thus \ndecreasing available funds for better service delivery and capacity building. Second, regional \ngovernments are seeking ways to expand income sources, i.e., taxes and levies, which in some \ncases (due to low capacity in formulating revenue policies) have become a burden to citizens \nand business. Third, central government PFM-related laws and regulations are often complex \nand inconsistent.  \n \n8.  Strategic policy and sector relevance. The project is in line with the government\u2019s \nplan to promote good national and local governance. The government\u2019s National Medium-Term \nDevelopment Plan (RPJMN), 2010\u20132014 identifies good governance as a priority. This priority \nintersects with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2012\u20132014 for Indonesia,7 which identifies \nimproved governance as essential for more inclusive growth, especially in the context of PFM \nand decentralization. The project is in line with ADB\u2019s existing support for local government \nsystems and capacity building in PFM under ADB\u2019s Second Local Government Finance and \n                                                 \n6  Sector Assessment: Public Sector Management (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n7  ADB. 2012. Country Partnership Strategy: Indonesia, 2012\u20132014. Manila. \n ", "3 \nGovernance  Reform  Program  (LGFGR). 8  The  project  targets  capacity  development  for \ndecentralized public management to improve governance; financial management systems of \nlocal  governments;  and  national  and  local  audit  systems,  and  capacity  for  planning, \npolicymaking, and financial management. This target supports BPKP\u2019s 2010\u20132014 strategic \nplans to strengthen PFM officer capacity to become professional and competent. They aim to \nhave 2,500 internal auditors at central and regional governments. \n \n9.  Lessons from ADB support for public sector management. The project\u2019s design \nbuilds on progress and lessons from three ADB programs: the State Audit Reform Sector \nDevelopment  Program,9 the  LGFGR  Sector  Development  Program,10 and  the  Sustainable \nCapacity Building for Decentralization Project.11 They show capacity building to be the key \ncomponent to implementing good governance practice in the government. In particular, focus \nshould  be  given  to  building  the  PFM  capacity  of  local  government  staff.  Incorporating \ninformation, and communication technology in the business processes of local governments \nimproves efficiency and increases their accountability. \n \n10.  Aid coordination. In the design of the project, ADB coordinated with other development \npartners, such as the Australian Agency for International Development, United States Agency \nfor International Development, and the World Bank. The World Bank, in particular, is managing \na multidonor trust fund on PFM, funded by the governments of Switzerland and the Netherlands, \nand the European Union.12 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The  impact  will  be  strengthened  accountability  of  central  and  local  government \ninstitutions to deliver high-quality public services. The outcome will be strengthened capacity of \nthe government\u2019s internal auditors and public finance officers to plan budgets, report, carry out \ninternal audits, and manage assets. \n \nC.  Outputs \n1.  Output 1: Capacity Development for Government Internal Auditors and \nPublic Finance Officers  \n12.  To meet the minimum standard central and regional competency requirements, the \nproject will provide financial resources for degree programs and certification for the current \ninternal auditors and PFM officers. The degree program will support an estimated 2,500 internal \nauditors and finance officers in obtaining graduate degrees in government accounting and \npublic finance. To ensure transparent and accountable selection, rigorous methodology based \non  objective  and  transparent  eligibility  criteria  for  the  universities  and  participants  will  be \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2008.

The project will finance specialized courses, training, and certifications for an estimated \n9,800 government internal auditors and finance officers of public institutions in central and \nregional governments, across provinces, districts, and cities. Certifying government internal \nauditors and PFM officers ensures GICS competencies. BPKP, through its regulation 211/2010, \nestablishes a competency standard or minimum requirement for auditors as a quality assurance \ntool for government internal auditors. The standards include minimum competency requirements \nfor  risk  management,  strategic  audit,  audit  reporting,  professional  attitude  in  audit, \ncommunication, public sector management, and audit management. BPKP\u2019s target for 2014 is \nthat all government internal auditors will comply with the competency standard. The training will \ncover PFM transactions in planning, budgeting, accounting, procurement, public debt, asset \nmanagement, ethics, and financial reporting. It will also cover training to support implementation \nof  the  GICS  and  state  budget  accounting  and  Presidential  Instruction  (Inpres)  No.4/2011, \nAcceleration in Quality Improvement of State Finance Accountability. Certification programs will \ninclude the mandatory auditor functional position (Jabatan Fungsional Auditor [JFA]).  \n \n14.  Cooperation between BPKP and regional governments. The project will seek to \nincrease  cooperation  between  BPKP  and  regional  governments  through  the  transfer  of \nknowledge  from  BPKP  as  the  central  government  internal  auditor  to  regional  government \ninternal auditors. This will include active participation of the BPKP training facility and BPKP \nestablishing centers of excellence of internal audit in selected regional universities. The transfer \nof knowledge will entail BPKP auditors to develop internal audit cooperation with selected \nregional governments and internal audit curriculum in local universities. The establishment of \nthe center of excellence in selected regional universities will promote (i) internal audit best \npractices  and  (ii)  cooperation  between  regional  universities  in  providing  PFM  courses.  In \nparticular, the project will look into promoting a twinning program between more- and less-\ndeveloped regional universities. \n \n15.  Training  of  trainers.  The  project  will  enhance  the  technical  and  training  skills  of  \n200  potential  internal  audit  trainers  from  BPKP  and  14  leading  regional  universities  by \nexamining best practice in the full spectrum of internal audit functions. The training will include \n(i) internal audit risk assessment process; (ii) setting of audit objectives and development of an \naudit plan; (iii) selection of a sample of representative contracts for audit; (iv) audit execution; (v) \nassessment of value for money; (vi) analysis of audit observations and findings, and discussion \nwith BPKP; (vii) audit reporting; and (viii) improvement of the training methodology. Topics such \nas  procurement  audit  and  contract  management  will  be  included.  The  project  will  instill \ninternational best practices for the trainers. BPKP will play an active role by providing resource \nspeakers to ensure that trainers have hands-on experience. \n \n2.  Output 2: Development of e-Learning System and Modules  \n16.  The project will develop an e-learning system and module for training and certifying \ngovernment internal auditors. Full implementation of the GICS will require 40,000 JFA-certified \ninternal auditors in central and local government inspectorates. The current annual capacity of \nconventional JFA training in BPKP is about 2,000 participants. The project will use an e-learning \nsystem as an innovative means to reach the target of 40,000. The project-funded e-learning \nsystem will encompass various forms of e-learning and e-teaching, and may include web and/or \ncomputer-based training, virtual classroom opportunities, and digital collaboration. The project \nwill provide funds to design the best system suitable for BPKP\u2019s needs to provide GICS training \n ", "5 \nto all government internal supervisory officials. The modules will be consistent and in equal \nquality as provided in the regular JFA classroom training, thus ensuring quality assurance of the \ngraduates. To ensure smooth implementation of the system, it will be tested, piloted, and rolled \nout on a trial basis before being fully implemented. Post project use of the e-learning system is \ncrucial to meet the demand for JFA-certified auditors, and therefore, ADB will ensure that BPKP \nallocates funding to continue use of the system under its national training and education center. \n \n3.  Output 3: Institutional Strengthening through System Improvement \n17.  State accountability management information system. The project will assist BPKP \nin  developing  an  integrated  SIMA  as  part  of  BPKP  infrastructure  strengthening.  Capacity \nbuilding for government PFM officers is expected to improve governance, particularly the quality \nof institution\u2019s financial statements or reports. With its new mandate, BPKP is in charge of \nensuring  quality  assurance  for  the  government\u2019s  financial  statements,  and  providing \nconsultations to stakeholders. The government institutions provide their financial reports to \nBPKP for quality assurance prior to submitting to BPK. The SIMA will enable BPKP to receive \nhigh-quality reports, and at the output end, provide accurate analysis and information to its \nstakeholders. The SIMA is expected to support BPKP\u2019s accessibility to the reports, and help it \nproduce quality and timely analysis for its stakeholders.  \n \n18.  SIMA development will consider existing systems, business process improvement and \nchange management, and communication with stakeholders. The project funding will be used to \ndesign, install, and roll out the system on a trial basis, as well as provide necessary training, and \nsoftware development and licenses. The project will undertake consultations and workshops on \nchange management with the stakeholders to ensure smooth system implementation. \n \n19.  Cross-sector evaluation system. The project will assist BPKP in piloting an evaluation \nsystem  for  cross-sector  programs  based  on  government  regulation  (PP)  60/2008,  which \nredefined BPKP\u2019s role as the President of Indonesia\u2019s auditors or the government internal \nauditors.13 As such, BPKP is mandated to conduct internal supervision or evaluation of state \nfinancial  accountability  over  certain  activities,  including  the  government\u2019s  cross-sector \nprograms. BPKP will conduct the evaluation and make recommendations to the President. As \nthis  authority  is  new  to  BPKP  and  in  line  with  the  project\u2019s  objective  to  improve  good \ngovernance in PFM, the project will support BPKP to develop standard audit procedures and \nexecute its authority. The project will select specific cross-sector programs on a pilot basis. The \nSIMA is expected to support an evaluation system for cross-sector programs. Thus, through this \npilot testing, the SIMA will be used to ensure its operationalization and any feedback will be \nused to improve the system. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n \n20.  The project is estimated to cost $60.53 million (Table 1).  \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n13 Article 49 para. (2) PP 60/2008. Cross-sector program involves two or more ministries or government agencies \n(central or regional) in planning and implementing the activities. Supervision over cross-sector program falls under \nBPKP\u2019s authority, not the internal auditors of the respective ministries. An example of a cross-sector program is \ndisaster management where the country\u2019s Agency for Disaster Management will have to coordinate with the \nMinistry of Public Works to undertake central and local reconstruction and rehabilitation activities. \n ", "6 \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \nAmounta\nItem  ($ million)\nA.

The government has requested a loan of $57.75 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the project. The loan will have an 18-year term, including a grace \nperiod  of  6  years,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. \n \n22.  The financing plan is in Table 2. The loan proceeds of $57.75 million will be made \navailable to the Ministry of Finance (MOF), which will channel the funds to BPKP, the executing \nagency. The loan proceeds will finance goods and services under the project outputs and \nproject implementation support. BPKP will fund the remainder of the project cost, estimated at \n$2.78 million (including $1.2 million for project management and $0.15 million for taxes and \nduties).

Implementation Arrangements \n23.  BPKP will be the executing agency. The project will be implemented over 5 years from \nJanuary 2013 to December 2017. As mandated in PP 60/2008, Inpres 4/2011, and RPJMN \n2010\u20132014, BPKP is the coordinator for the GICS implementation. \n \n ", "7 \n24.  The project will help BPKP develop modules for training and certification, taking into \naccount existing training manuals on state budget accounting, and internal audit as references. \nBPKP will coordinate with the Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA) and MOF in conducting training \nand developing training materials for public finance officers. This coordination is imperative to \nencompass training already provided by MOF\u2019s directorate generals of fiscal balance and of \ntreasury  on  regional  financial  management  and  on  budgeting  (also  provided  by  MOHA\u2019s \nDirectorate General of Regional Finance). In addition to the development of training manuals, \ncoordination will focus on utilizing the information system for regional finance management. The \nregional financial information system will be viewed as a tool to improve financial management \nof regional governments nationwide, while the main objective still focuses on increasing the \ncapacity of personnel who manage financial planning, budgeting, reporting, and auditing. \n \n25.  The project will help BPKP conduct the regional training and certification program, which \nwill utilize BPKP\u2019s 25 representative offices across Indonesia and regional universities. The \nregional  offices  will  be  the  training  centers  for  the  region\u2019s  PFM  officers.  BPKP\u2019s  existing \nmemorandums of understandings with local universities will support the training activities.  \n \n26.  BPKP will be responsible for project planning, implementation, financial management, \nprocurement, information dissemination, and reporting. It will set up a project management unit \nwith the head of BPKP\u2019s bureau for audit planning as project director to provide oversight. The \nBPKP  project  manager  will  assist  the  project  director  with  day-to-day  management  of  the \nproject. A project implementation unit will be set up in each BPKP regional office.   The  project \nwill form a steering committee to provide overall policy guidance, and monitor, supervise, and \nevaluate project outcomes. The committee will also provide guidance on the selection criteria for \nthe degree program candidates and criteria for participating universities. BPKP will chair the \ncommittee,  which  will  comprise  directors  from  BPKP,  MOF,  MOHA  and  the  National \nDevelopment Planning Agency (BAPPENAS). The project will develop effective and efficient \nmonitoring covering all provinces, districts, and cities to ensure timely implementation, while \nmaintaining high quality standards for the program. The  implementation  arrangements  are \nsummarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the project administration manual.14  \n \n27.  Assisted by consultants financed under the project, BPKP will develop rigorous selection \nmethodology  for  the  universities  participating  in  the  degree  program  (output  1)  to  provide \nobjective and transparent eligibility criteria, including (i) a university with a master\u2019s degree \n(graduate) study program in accounting or public finance registered with the Directorate General \nof Higher Education of the Ministry of Education and Culture; and (ii) such study program has at \nleast a \u201cB\u201d accreditation from the National Accreditation Agency for Higher Education. The \nuniversity eligibility criteria will be agreed with ADB. Further, BPKP guided by the steering \ncommittee, and based on equitable and transparent criteria will select relevant government \nofficers as candidates to participate in the study program. The project will develop the criteria \nusing the government\u2019s criteria for the master\u2019s degree government scholarship program as a \nstandard. The list of selected participants will be published and periodically updated. For cost \nefficiency, a participating student will enroll in the eligible university located in the vicinity of the \nstudent\u2019s residence. If and when selected participants are in proximity to a university that meets \nthe agreed eligibility criteria, the university will be engaged through single-source selection \nunder service delivery assignment (education) contracts to provide specialized degree courses \nto the selected participants. The project administration manual identifies candidate universities.  \n \n                                                 \n14  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements\nImplementation period  January 2013 \u2013December 2017 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2017 \nManagement \n(i) Oversight body  Steering committee  \nBPKP deputy of politics, social and security (chair) \nDirectors from BPKP, MOF, MOHA, and the National Development Planning \nAgency (BAPPENAS), (members) \n(ii) Executing agency  BPKP \n(iii) Key implementing agencies   BPKP \n(iv) Implementing unit   BPKP central and representative Offices, 60 staff \nProcurement  National competitive bidding and/or  Up to 12 contracts  $4.9 million \nshopping \nConsulting services  Quality- and cost-based selection  840 person-months  $4.6 million \n  Individual consultant selection  144 person-months  $0.7 million \nOthers       \nExtension degree program  Modified single-source selection  Multiple contracts  $4.8 million \nMaster\u2019s degree program  Modified single-source selection  Multiple contracts  $13.4 million \nDisbursement   The  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2012, as amended from time to time) and detailed \narrangements agreed upon between the government and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, BPKP = Central Government Internal Auditors, MOF = Ministry of Finance, MOHA \n= Ministry of Home Affairs. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical  \n28.  The project provides significant technical improvements through the use of accountability \nand e-learning systems based on information and communication technology in BPKP. An \nassessment of technical viability will be conducted during system design. It will review available \ninfrastructure, technology, and compatibility with local conditions prior to system installation, \ntaking into account other ADB-funded e-learning projects in other countries. Local staff capacity \nwill be evaluated for system operation and maintenance, and upgraded as needed. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n29.  The economic rationale for the project rests largely on promoting good governance \nthrough stronger capacity of internal auditors and public finance officers. Good governance will \nprovide efficient and effective use of state funds for development to benefit the nation. Budget \nleakages across governments in the country are expected to be reduced through improved \ncompetency of government internal auditors and public finance officers. Improved governance \nand transparency will improve investor confidence. \n \nC.  Governance \n30.  BPKP has sufficient capacity, staffing, and systems in place for financial, accounting, \nand procurement functions. As the government\u2019s internal auditors, BPKP has extensive financial \nmanagement  capacity,  and  is  responsible  for  setting  benchmarks  for  good  financial \nmanagement to other government bodies. All BPKP staff hold the minimum of a diploma in \naccounting from the State Accounting Institute. Based on its experience in implementing the \nADB-funded State Audit Reform Sector Development Program, BPKP is expected to have the \ncapacity  to  manage  project  implementation,  financial  management,  and  procurement  in \n ", "9 \naccordance with ADB guidelines and requirements. Thus, management control of the project \ncan be relied upon. Some new staff unfamiliar with ADB procedures will be provided with \ntraining on ADB project management, administration, procurement, and disbursement.  \n \n31.  Due diligence to ensure sound selection of candidates for the degree program and \nparticipating universities covered under the project is required to achieve the project objectives. \nIn coordination with the Ministry of Education and Culture, the project\u2019s steering committee will \nissue and implement transparent guidelines on criteria for selecting candidates and universities \nto participate in the degree program to ensure program quality. The guidelines will include \nselection procedures and mechanisms to implement the program. \n \n32.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and BPKP. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the project administration manual.15  \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n33.  The  project  will  support  Indonesia\u2019s  poverty  reduction  goals  through  improved \naccountability of public institutions in managing state funds. This improvement will enhance \npublic confidence in the government and therefore enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of \ndelivering basic public services to the poor.  Regional disparities in terms of poverty rates and \naccess to basic services continue. In 2010, Maluku province reported a poverty rate of 27.7%, \ncompared  with  3.5%  in  Jakarta  and  4.3%  in  Bali.  Inequalities  extend  to  other  human \ndevelopment dimensions. East Maluku reported a human development index16 of 70.96 in 2009, \nwell  below  77.36  for  Jakarta.  The  percentage  of  households  with  improved  sanitation  in \nYogyakarta is more than 75%, compared with around 25% in Papua and Kalimantan Tengah. At \nleast 12 provinces report that fewer than 70% of households have access to electricity; about 12 \nprovinces  report  almost  full  coverage.  Progress  in  reducing  poverty  and  achieving  the \nMillennium Development Goals will largely depend on improved access to, and quality of, basic \nservices delivered to the local population. In supporting it, increased efforts are needed to \naccelerate development in lagging regions, strengthen pro-poor elements of regional budgets, \nand improve public financial systems and governance. \n \n34.  The project has some gender elements because it will directly improve women's access \nto capacity and career development through education and training programs supported by the \nproject. At start-up, the project will collect and determine sex-disaggregated baseline data for all \nparticipating regional governments and the central government. The project will ensure that at \nleast 30% of participants under output 1 are women. The project will include sex-disaggregated \ndata in the monitoring and evaluation system to ensure the female representation target is \nachieved at project completion.  \n  \nE.  Safeguards \n35.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified \nunder category C for impacts on the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous \n                                                 \n15  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16 The human development index is a composite statistic used to rank provinces by \"human development\" and \nseparate \"very high human development,\" \"high human development,\" \"medium human development,\" and \"low \nhuman development\" provinces. The Center Bureau of Statistics prepares the provincial index in Indonesia. The \nstatistics comprise data on life expectancy, education, and per-capita gross national income (as an indicator of \nstandard of living or income) collected by subnational governments. \n ", "10 \npeoples. The project will involve capacity building activities. Hence, no adverse environmental \nimpacts are expected. Land acquisition and resettlement is not expected because the project \nwill take place in existing government offices and/or university premises. The project is not \nexpected to affect indigenous peoples.  \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n36.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.17 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures\nLack of government ownership will  In addition to the regular steering committee meetings, ADB will actively support \nresult in late implementation  policy dialogue among key stakeholders to help ensure continued government \nownership.

A focal point from each government agency will be \nappointed to facilitate.  BAPPENAS' monitoring meetings will be a forum to \nensure BPKP's smooth project implementation, i.e. BAPPENAS relevant sector \ndepartments will provide necessary supports to resolve project issues, not only \nif there is an issue with data access. \nTrained staff will be transferred or  BPKP will sign a memorandum of understanding with the head of the regions to \npromoted to nonrelated positions  retain participating staff in positions for at least 2 years after training, and place \ntransferred or promoted staff in positions relevant to their qualifications. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES  \n37.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the project will conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the project \nadministration manual and loan documents. \n \n38.  The government has agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are \nset forth in the loan agreement.  \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n39.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$57,750,000 to the Republic of Indonesia for the State Accountability Revitalization Project, \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of 18 years, including a \ngrace period of 6 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance \nwith those set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board. \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n8 October 2012 \n                                                 \n17 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "  Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData Sources \nPerformance Targets and  and Reporting  Assumptions  \nDesign Summary  Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact  Five years after project completion:    Assumptions \nStrengthened  Integrity index of central and regional  KPK  Full commitment of national \naccountability of public  public institutions increased from 6 in  and regional governments to \n \ninstitutions able to  2009, to 8  implement relevant policies and \ndeliver high-quality  BPKP  actions related to \nGovernment internal supervisory \npublic services  implementation of the GICS \nofficial governance improved from \n  20% nationwide in 2010 to 60%a   Risks \n  Delay in enactments of relevant \nimplementing regulations for \nPP No. 60/2008 related to \ninternal audit (implementation \nof the GICS) \nOutcome  By 2017:    Assumptions \nImproved capacity of  Percentage of BPK\u2019s \u201cunqualified\u201d  BPK audit  Strong commitment from \ngovernment internal  audit opinion increased by 100% at  reports  K/L/Pemda \nauditors and public  the central level from 42.17% in \n  Risks \nfinance officers in  2009, and by 60% in the regions \nbudget planning,  from 2.73% in 2009     Trained officers assigned in \nreporting, internal audit,  nonrelevant position \nand asset management  100% timely submission of financial  BPK audit \nreports to BPK  reports \n \nInternal audits are undertaken in  BPK audit \naccordance with professional  reports \nstandards and using a modern risk-\nbased audit methodology \nOutputs  By 2017:    Assumptions \n1.
