THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FACILITY SUBPROJECT \n \nA.  Justification \n \n1.  The proposed transaction technical assistance (TA),  a subproject under the transaction \ntechnical assistance cluster (C-TA 0040-INO) for Sustainable Infrastructure Assistance Program \nPhase II (SIAP2), has been designed as a transaction technical assistance facility which will \nsupport the preparation of the following projects on renewable energy and energy efficiency: the \nSustainable  and  Inclusive  Energy  Program  Policy-Based  Loan  subprogram  3  (SIEP3),  the \nRenewable Energy Development Project, and a Sustainable and Efficient Sector Development \nProgram (SESDP). \n \n2.    SIAP2 was approved on 29 November 2018 and is due to close on 30 June 2024. SIAP2 \nprovides (i) project preparation support to specific ensuing infrastructure projects listed in Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB) current and future country operations business plans for Indonesia; \n(ii) implementation and capacity-building support to specific ongoing ADB-funded infrastructure \nprojects; and (iii) knowledge and policy advisory support in the areas of infrastructure planning \nand financing, together with program management support for effective SIAP2 implementation. \nAs of 23 July 2019, total approvals are $8,000,000 (26.67% of total funds against time elapsed of \n10%), and there are no disbursements so far.1 As of 23 July 2019, SIAP2 has an available balance \nof $22,000,000, including the ADB management fee and foreign exchange reservations. \n \n3.   In the face of fast-growing energy demand, Indonesia needs to reform its energy policy \nframework to address the expected increases in energy use and limit the potential increased \ngreenhouse  gas  emissions  from  the  surge  in  energy  consumption.  Indonesia\u2019s  energy \nconsumption is among the world\u2019s fastest growing in both percentage and absolute terms. It is \nestimated that Indonesia\u2019s electricity consumption will more than triple by 2030.2 A growing middle \nclass and rapid adoption of electrical appliances in Indonesia are driving this unprecedented \nincrease in peak electricity demand, increasing the stress on electricity grids, raising energy costs, \nand contributing to carbon dioxide emissions growth. The transport sector is the largest user of \noil-based energy products in Indonesia and is also a key contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. \nIn addition, air pollution is a critical environmental and health challenge in Indonesia\u2019s largest \ncities and addressing this with cleaner solutions will be a key contributor to a sustainable energy \ntransformation.  \n \n4.  Renewable energy policy design and renewable energy investments by the public and \nprivate sector need strong support to start the needed energy transformation. The expected \nsubstantial size of Indonesia\u2019s energy demand growth necessitates large scale infrastructure \ninvestments. For climate, sustainability, and energy security reasons, these investments need to \nbe on a low carbon path, which is possible given the potential of 788 gigawatts of new and \nrenewable energy supply, most of which remains untapped. While Indonesia set a target in 2015 \nfor renewable energy to reach 23% of primary energy supply by 2025, its current 8% share is not \nenough progress. Developing renewable energy also presents an opportunity to reduce primary \nenergy costs. Indonesia has significant solar power resources with 4.8 kWh/m2 (kilowatt hour per \nsquare meter) per day, and an estimated total potential of 9.3 gigawatts for onshore wind energy, \nbut still needs to develop a meaningful solar and wind energy market. Renewable energy has \nbeen held back by an incoherent policy support environment, subsidized fossil-based energy \n                                                \n1   As of 23 July 2019, one subproject (Knowledge and Support Technical Assistance for Innovative Infrastructure \nFinancing, Infrastructure Planning, and Program Management Support) has been approved under C-TA 0040-INO.  \n2   International Renewable Energy Agency. Renewable Energy Projects: Indonesia (Executive Summary). 2017. \n ", "2   \npricing, inadequate electricity grid and grid balancing capacity, and the absence of investable risk \ncapital and financing.  \n \n5.  Energy efficiency is a cost positive intervention in the energy sector and both policy \nsupport and early stage investments to prove the market are needed. The huge energy demand \ngrowth also necessitates energy efficiency measures as a cost-effective means of lessening the \ninvestment and infrastructure development burden, and further promoting climate, sustainability \nand energy security goals. The National Energy Master Plan 2017 assesses that Indonesia has \na potential for 10%\u201335% savings in energy efficiency across multiple sectors.3 On this basis, the \ngovernment targets 17% energy savings by 2025, which translates into approximately $18 billion \nin avoided cost, and is equivalent to construction of 20 new 500- to 1,000-megawatt power plants. \nReaching this target would avoid 341 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions, which \nrepresents 17% of Indonesia\u2019s emission reduction target of two giga tons by 2030 under its \nNationally Determined Contribution.4 A key gap is a lack of working  financial mechanism to \nenable  financing,  and  the  absence  of  public-private  partnership  (PPP)  schemes  between \nmunicipalities, central government agencies, state-owned enterprises and private sector energy \nefficiency service companies. A lack of credible data and energy baselines is also a challenge. \n \n6.  The  capacity  of  both  public  and  private  sector  actors  in  Indonesia  to  implement  a \nsustainable  energy  transformation  varies  greatly  between  institutions,  departments  and \nenterprises. The financial community lacks deep knowledge on the latest sector developments \nand technologies, while the energy community does not have much experience with innovative \nfinancing and regulatory frameworks to leverage more private sector participation. The level of \nknowledge and experience decreases from central to local levels where physical infrastructure \nimplementation, operation, and maintenance needs to happen. In addition to reforming policies \nand  supporting  investments,  practitioners  and  financiers  need  to  become  enablers  to \nsystematically support the needed transformation. \n \n7.  The TA subproject is included in the Country Business Operations Plan 2019\u20132022 and \nconsistent  with  the  Country  Partnership  Strategy  for  Indonesia,  2016\u201320195 priorities  of \nincreasing sustainable energy access across the country, promoting clean energy, and supporting \nreforms to accelerate infrastructure investment. It is also consistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 \nvision on promoting sustainable development through interventions in infrastructure to improve \naccess to energy and accelerating low greenhouse gas emissions development. The TA will \nsupport the following Operational Priorities under Strategy 2030: OP 3 Tackling climate change, \nbuilding climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability and OP 6 \nstrengthening governance and institutional capacity. It also supports sustainable development \ngoal 7: Affordable and Clean Energy. \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n8.  Output 1: Sustainable and inclusive energy policy reforms prepared. Under this \noutput, the TA will provide support to Indonesia for the formulation of (i) policy and regulatory \nreforms to address the expected increase in energy demand, and (ii) a policy framework to \n                                                \n3  National  Energy  Master  Plan  (Rencana  Umum  Energi  Nasional  [RUEN])  2017, \nhttps://www.esdm.go.id/assets/media/content/content-rencana-umum-energi-nasional-ruen.pdf  \n4  M.

Manila.  \n ", "3 \npromote the increase of renewable energy, energy efficiency, and electric transport investments, \n(iii) as well as increased private sector participation via PPPs. Output 1 will focus on providing \npolicy advice to relevant government ministries and agencies, identifying policy and regulatory \nsolutions to barriers for the growth of renewable energy, enhanced energy efficiency market \ndevelopment,  and  the  deployment  of  electric  vehicles  and  sustainable  (solar)  charging \ninfrastructure. The TA will also analyze gender barriers and policy opportunities for women \nempowerment in energy sector regulation. The support for the government\u2019s clean energy policy \nframework formulation will concentrate on the readiness of the policy actions and triggers under \nthe SIEP3, subprogram 3, and the SESDP. The intention is to address the financial stability of the \nsector, leverage private sector investments, and further clean energy policies. The TA will provide \nanalytical support for policy and planning design using tools such as focus group discussions, \ndirect policy advice, expert inputs to policy development, and review of existing policies. \n \n9.  Output 2: Renewable energy projects and programs prepared. The TA will provide \nsupport for the preparation of economically viable renewable energy projects and programs with \nboth central government agencies and state-owned enterprises. The TA will work with the \ngovernment on prioritizing, planning, and preparing a series of renewable investment projects to \nimplement the electrification program, to reach 100% electricity access for rural households using \noff-grid  renewables  including  mini-grids  and  stand-alone  home  systems.  This  may  include \nfinancing options to rehabilitate existing but defunct off-grid solar photo-voltaic systems. Special \nattention will be given to involving women in the design and operation and maintenance of \ncommunal electricity systems as well as training modules how to use electricity efficiently and \nproductively.  The  TA  will  support  feasibility  studies;  (ii)  economic  analysis;  (iii)  financial \nmanagement  assessments,  financial  evaluation  and  financial  analysis;  (iv)  procurement \nassessments, procurement plans, and preparation of bidding documents; (v) gender analysis, \ncollection of baseline data, and gender action plans; (vi) risk assessment and management plans; \nand (vii) safeguards documents on environment, involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples \nfor the renewable energy projects as the basis for ensuing lending program. It will also support a \nstate-owned enterprise with the construction of utility-scale on-grid and/or captive renewable \nenergy generation for industrial and commercial use, thus increasing the sustainability of existing \nenergy-intensive industries. \n \n10.  Output 3: Energy efficiency projects prepared. Closely tied to the policy work, the TA \nwill prepare an energy efficiency investment program to enable municipalities and government \ncontracting agencies to engage in energy efficiency savings programs with energy efficiency \nservice companies (ESCOs) under Indonesia\u2019s revised 2018 legislation on PPPs, Regulation on \nGovernment Procurement of Goods and Services Policy 29/2018, (Peraturan Lembaga Kebijakan \nPengadaaan Barang / Jasa Pemerintah), which regulates solicited PPPs. The focus will be on \nreplacing municipal street lighting and retrofitting buildings. The TA will develop a feasibility study, \neconomic analysis, and implementation arrangements to establish a guarantee product on energy \nefficiency with the Indonesia Infrastructure Guarantee Fund, and provide capacity building for \nmunicipalities and the banking sector on project preparation and financial, economic, technical \nand gender assessment of energy efficiency projects. The fund would guarantee the savings \npayments from the energy efficiency project owner to the implementing ESCO, and in turn make \nboth the ESCO and the project bankable, and open access to commercial credit for the ESCOs \nto pre-finance the project. \n \n11.  Output  4:  Innovation  and  institutional  capacity  enhanced.  In  order  to  ensure \nimplementation capacity of the executing agency and implementing agencies, the TA will support \nthe identification of training and capacity building required at government agencies and relevant \ninstitutions  on  formulating  standards,  setting  up  baselines,  addressing  financial  barriers, \n ", "4   \ninstitutional strengthening, and knowledge sharing related to PPPs and energy efficiency. These \nwill also include financial experts to work with the various agencies in the energy sector to identify \nexisting regulations for PPPs and energy efficiency, and to engage in activities that will help \ndevelop mechanisms relevant to the Indonesian context. Support for the government\u2019s plans to \nprioritize the electrification of public transport will be a key feature of the capacity-building effort, \nincluding gender and disability considerations related to the design and operation of e-vehicles.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,550,000 of which $1,500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Government of Australia through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and \nadministered by ADB. The scope of the TA is expected to expand to cover additional activities, \nconsistent with the TA\u2019s outputs and outcome, and be replenished from time to time as funds are \nrequired and identified, including those from cofinancing sources and ADB-administered trust \nfunds. The government will provide counterpart support in the form of communication facilities \nand other in-kind contributions. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are shown in \nAppendix 1. Activities will start after obtaining no-objection from the government. The government \nwas informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  ADB will select, supervise and evaluate the consultants. ADB will hire a firm and individual \nconsultant to provide the consultancy services to ensure integrated project delivery. The TA \nsubproject does not include procurement of goods other than office equipment and workshop \nvenues.
