INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  Five Pacific countries (Fiji Islands, Papua New Guinea [PNG], Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, \nand Vanuatu), which lie within or border the Coral Triangle of the Pacific,1 raised key concerns \nregarding  the  management  of  their  coastal  and  marine  resources.  In  response,  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) provided a regional technical assistance (TA) grant to prepare a program \nto  strengthen  the  management  of  coastal  and  marine  resources  in  the  Coral  Triangle.2 This \nproposed phase 2 program will assist PNG, Solomon Islands, and Timor-Leste in fulfilling their Coral \nTriangle Initiative (CTI) objectives; and engage with the Fiji Islands and Vanuatu in these efforts. 3 \nThese  five  Pacific  countries  have  demonstrated  their  interest  in  cooperating  with  the  Global \nEnvironment  Facility\u2014Pacific  Alliance  for  Sustainability  (GEF-PAS). 4  Since  there  are  strong \ncomplementary objectives between the CTI and GEF-PAS objectives, and the Fiji Islands and \nVanuatu are eligible for GEF cofinancing, this TA will provide a common approach to integrated \nmarine protected area management with efforts to control damage from pollutants derived from \nonshore activities. 5 The TA will also complement ongoing and planned efforts of ADB\u2019s Southeast \nAsia Department,6 as well as its development partners (such as the GEF, the United States Agency \nfor International Development,7 and the Australian Agency for International Development) in the \nCoral Triangle, which are all intended to support the Coral Triangle countries in the conservation and \nmanagement of coral reef and associated habitats for food security and poverty reduction. The \ngovernments  of  the  five  participating  countries  were  consulted,  and  agreed  with  the  proposed \nimpact, output, outcomes, implementation arrangements, cost and financing arrangements, and \nterms of reference for consultants. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Key coastal and marine resource management issues identified in the five Pacific countries \ninclude (i) coastal development and fishing pressures, including overexploitation of coastal areas \nand overharvesting of valuable species; destructive fishing practices used in the live reef food fish \ntrade; illegal, unregulated, and unreported fishing; and sediment and effluent discharge from the \nwatershed areas; (ii) climate change impacts; (iii) weak management of natural resources systems; \nand (iv) extremely limited staff and budgetary resources and capacity for public sector environmental \n                                                 \n1  The Coral Triangle is a global center of marine diversity covering 5.7 million square kilometers and containing vast \nmarine resources critical to the economic and food security of an estimated 120 million people. \n2  ADB. 2008.

Technical \nAssistance for Regional Cooperation in Knowledge Management, Policy, and Institutional Support to the Coral Triangle \nInitiative. Manila (TA 7307-REG, approved on 8 July) and the proposed regional TA for Strengthening Coastal and \nMarine Resources Management in the CTI-Southeast Asia.  \n3  As stated in the CTI national and regional plans of action. The CTI was established in 2007 by the governments of \nIndonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, PNG, Solomon Islands, and Timor-Leste, agreeing on core principles and a \nframework for the development of a CTI plan of action. The plan of action addresses interrelated issues facing the future \nof coral reefs, fisheries, and food security, which are considered priority development issues that have increasingly \nthreatened a significant proportion of coastal communities.   \n4  The  GEF-PAS  is  a  regional  effort  increasing  attention  on  global  environmental  concerns  that  support  national \ndevelopment priorities in partnership with the GEF and its agencies. ADB is one of 10 GEF agencies with access to GEF \nfinancing for activities that support the achievement of global environmental objectives in areas such as climate change \n(mitigation and adaptation), biodiversity conservation, and management of international waters.  \n5  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 23 August 2010. \n6  ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance for Strengthening Sound Environmental Management in the Brunei Darussalam, \nIndonesia, Malaysia, and Philippines East ASEAN Growth Area. Manila (TA 6446-REG). \n7  The Government of the United States has a financing commitment of $42.15 million for the CTI in Southeast Asia and \nthe Pacific, of which $11.4 million, or 27% of the total, is intended for PNG, Solomon Islands, and Timor-Leste.   \n ", "2  \nmanagement programs\u2014all of which are exacerbated by high rates of population growth and rural \npoverty, creating food insecurity concerns. 8 \n \n3.  Coastal resource management lies mostly outside of any effective governance framework. \nHowever, the reinvigoration of community-based natural resource management reflecting traditional \nrights to exclude outsiders from accessing community resources is being strengthened to build a \nresource  management  framework.  Community-based  natural  resource  management  alone  is \nconsidered  insufficient  as  a  means  of  achieving  sustainable  coastal  and  marine  resources \nmanagement. Key limitations include (i) the lack of mechanisms to address external threats such as \nclimate  change  and  its  impacts;  (ii)  the  inability  to  address  cumulative  effects  of  multiple \ncommunities drawing from linked resources; (iii) the inability to address the influences from factors \noutside community-controlled resources, such as sediment and nutrient movement, into coastal \necosystems;  and  (iv)  the  challenge  of  managing  an  increased  population,  increased \ncommercialization of harvesting, and the impact of new technologies.  \n \n4.  Most  governments  are  unable  to  go  down  to  the  grassroots  level  and  support  the \nmanagement of coastal and marine resources using an integrated ecosystems approach. In general, \nexisting  government  resources  and  organizations  are  more  focused  on  achieving  sector \ndevelopment objectives, rather than on resource management or community well-being goals. As a \nresult,  staff  levels  and  skill  sets  do  not  match  resource  management  needs.  Most  of  these \ngovernment agencies do not consider natural resource management policy and legal reform as \npriorities because of factors such as (i) implementation constraints or limitations at the local level, (ii) \nlack  of  understanding  of  best  management  practices  (BMPs)  at  the  community  level,  and  (iii) \noverexploitation  of  resources  for  economic  reasons.  Policy  and  institutional  weaknesses  are \nexacerbated by weak monitoring and evaluation and information systems for strategic planning, \nprogram implementation, and monitoring of sector performance, among others. \n \n5.  Increased management effectiveness requires (i) new approaches and tools to move from \nspecies-based  management  to  an  area-based  management  approach;  (ii)  a  shift  from  the \nmanagement of coastal waters to managing wider ecosystems, including linkages to catchment land \nuse  within  a  \u201cridge  to  reef\u201d  approach  to  manage  sediment  and  nutrient  loading  into  coastal \necosystems; (iii) a change in focus from fish utilization to fisheries management based on habitat \nmanagement within an ecosystems management model or ecosystem-based fisheries management \n(EBFM);  (iv)  establishing  linkages  between  climate  change  adaptation  and  integrated  coastal \nresource  management  (ICRM)  and  mainstreaming  these  into  national,  subnational,  and  sector \ndevelopment planning; and (v) establishing a system of sustainable financing, including payment for \necosystem services, and orienting financial resources toward the achievement of the CTI national \nand regional plans of action, which provide the frameworks adopted by the countries to focus work in \nthe CTI.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n6.  The TA will help ensure food security for the population in Pacific CTI countries, resulting \nfrom the increased resilience of coastal and marine ecosystems. It will support the introduction of \nmore effective management of coastal and marine resources, especially those associated with coral \necosystems, to build their resilience in a period of increased threats arising from human induced and \nclimate change impacts. The TA will contribute toward halting or reversing the expected decline in \n                                                 \n8  A consequence of increased population levels will be increased reliance on subsistence, village-level socioeconomic \nsystems that currently provide the only social safety net. For coastal communities, this will increase demand for land, \nwater, and coastal resources that are often already stressed. \n ", "  3\necosystem  productivity  caused  by  these  stressors  through  more  effective  management  that \naddresses land and water interactions and the management of threats to coastal habitats arising \nfrom local human activities. By maintaining productivity over a longer time frame, local community \nwell-being will be ensured.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n7.  The impact and outcomes will be attained through four outputs: (i) capabilities of national and \nlocal institutions strengthened for sustainable coastal and marine resource management, (ii) coastal \ncommunities experienced in applying best practices in ecosystem-based management and climate \nchange  adaptation,  (iii)  resilience  of  coastal  ecosystems  to  climate  change  enhanced,  and \n(iv) effective program management established by ADB and the participating governments. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1, and a detailed description of the program is in \nSupplementary Appendix 1.  \n \n8.  Output 1: Capabilities of national and local institutions strengthened in sustainable \ncoastal and marine resources management. The TA will support the strengthening of national \nand local institutions and stakeholders in ICRM and EBFM through (i) the conduct of a wide range of \nnational- and local-level training courses aimed to refocus sector agencies away from an economic \nutilization to an increasingly resource management and climate adaptation orientation; and (ii) the \nestablishment or improvement of an enabling environment for institutionalizing effective ICRM and \nEBFM. 9 The latter will involve the following activities, among others: (i) enhancement of the policy \nand legal framework for sustainable financing options and organizational reform leading to the \nadoption of a \u201cwhole of government\u201d perspective for strategic planning, monitoring, and detailed \nICRM and EBFM planning; (ii) building of public sector legal capacity and promoting the participation \nof private sector lawyers in environmental matters and in international and regional law networks; \nand (iii) synthesis of BMPs, successes, and lessons for use in developing legal and policy reform \nroad  maps  with  priority  reforms  drafted,  including  at  the  provincial  and  local  level;  and  (iv) \ndevelopment  of  coastal  and  marine  information  systems  and  building  of  resource  information \ncapacity in national and local government agencies. \n \n9.  Output 2: Coastal communities experienced in applying best practices in ecosystem-\nbased  management  and  climate  change  adaptation.  Stakeholders  will  be  supported  in \ncustomizing and adapting natural resource management approaches to local conditions to make \nthem more effective. BMPs in ICRM and EBFM will be identified, agreed, and used to strengthen the \npolicy, legal, and institutional reform agenda as well as planning procedures to support local-level \nimplementation. ICRM plans will be developed to define management priorities at the ecosystems \nlevel  and  above,  and  spatial  plans  will  be  taken  down  to  the  community  level,  where  local \nmanagement plans will be prepared by those with responsibility at the provincial and local levels. \nAbout 48 pilot demonstration projects on ecosystem-based management, including climate change \nadaptation, will be implemented by designated community-based organizations that will be provided \nwith small grants. The progress of implementation of these pilot projects will be evaluated through \nan  annual  participatory  stakeholder  program  that  will  identify  achievements,  successes,  and \nconstraints. \n \n10.  Output 3: Resilience of coastal ecosystems to climate change enhanced. A climate \nchange adaptation program will be linked to ICRM to increase the resilience of coastal ecosystems \nto climate change. The program will support the five Pacific countries in (i) conducting climate \nvulnerability  assessments;  (ii)  developing  climate  adaptation  measures  with  TA  provided  by \n                                                 \n9  About 1,000 trainees from government agencies, nongovernment organizations, and other stakeholders in the five \nparticipating countries will benefit from various training courses to be conducted under the TA (see Supplementary \nAppendix 2 for details). \n ", "4  \nscientists to coastal communities; (iii) creating wide public awareness of climate change challenges \nand threats to coastal ecosystems, including human communities; and (iv) developing knowledge \nproducts related to (a) methods and procedures for the characterization of future climate risks, \n(b) guidelines for BMPs in multi-scale vulnerability assessment, and (c) guidelines for completing \nadaptation planning and its integration with ICRM and EBFM planning. \n \n11.  Output 4: Effective program management established by ADB and the participating \ngovernments. A program management system will be set up, consisting of a TA coordination unit \n(TCU) within ADB\u2019s Pacific Department (PARD), a regional program management office (RPMO) to \nbe  located  in  PNG,  and  national  program  management  units  (NPMUs)  in  each  of  the  five \nparticipating countries. A program performance management system will be designed and installed \nin the ADB-TCU and the NPMUs, which will include the agreed performance indicators, targets, and \ndata and/or information sources, as defined in the design and monitoring framework. An international \nprogram coordinator and a program management consultant (firm) will be engaged by ADB to \nsupport  the  countries  in  program  planning,  implementation,  and  liaison  with  ADB  and  the  CTI \nregional secretariat.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.   The TA is estimated to cost the equivalent of $18,500,000, of which $1,150,000 will be \nfinanced by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV) and $800,000 will be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund10 under the Regional Cooperation and \nFinancing Partnership Facility. The GEF will provide $13,100,000 equivalent as a grant11 to be \nadministered  by  ADB.  The  Australian  Institute  of  Marine  Science  will  provide  about  $450,000 \nequivalent in-kind contribution on a tied basis, which will not be administered by ADB. The remaining \n$3,000,000 will be contributed by the five participating governments12 through in-kind counterpart \nsupport services and related costs. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  Executing and implementing agencies. ADB will be the executing agency, through PARD, \nand will exercise overall responsibility for the coordination, supervision, and implementation of all \nproject activities. The execution of the TA will be the responsibility of the following agencies: (i) Fiji \nIslands: Department of Environment under the guidance of the Integrated Coastal Management \nCommittee; (ii) PNG: Department of Environment and Conservation; (iii) Solomon Islands: Ministry \nof Environment and Conservation Management and Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources; \n(iv) Timor-Leste:  National  Directorate  of  Fisheries  and  Aquaculture,  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and \nFisheries; and (v) Vanuatu: Department of Environment, Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources. \nThe TA will be implemented over a 4-year period commencing on 1 January 2011 and ending on 31 \nDecember 2014. \n \n14.  Program  management.  A  TCU  will  be  set  up  within  PARD  and  will  comprise  core \nprofessional staff, support staff services, and an international program coordinator who will oversee \nday-to-day TA implementation on behalf of ADB. The TCU will liaise with other relevant ADB units \nand/or offices, particularly the South Pacific Subregional Office, Pacific Liaison and Coordination \nOffice, PNG Resident Mission, Special Office in Timor-Leste, and focal points concerned in the \nRegional and Sustainable Development Department and the Southeast Asia Department.  \n \n                                                 \n10 Established by ADB. \n11 Breakdown of GEF financing by country is as follows: Fiji Islands, $1.1 million; PNG, $4.0 million; Solomon Islands, $2.9 \nmillion; Timor-Leste, $2.7 million; and Vanuatu, $2.4 million.   \n12 Governments of Fiji Islands, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, and Vanuatu. \n ", "  5\n15.  At the national level, an NPMU will be set up in each implementing agency to oversee and \ncoordinate the implementation of program activities in the field. The NPMUs will be responsible for \n(i) preparing  the  work  plan,  administering  the  local  contracting  services,  maintaining  program \naccounts  for  monitoring  expenses,  and  preparing  liquidation  reports;  (ii)  setting  up  a  program \nperformance management system for supervising and monitoring the work program for specific \ncomponents and activities, linking the national coordinating committees to the CTI monitoring and \nevaluation system at the CTI Secretariat, and preparing local progress and monitoring reports; \n(iii) coordinating the local activities of the different program implementers; and (iv) liaising with the \nnational coordinating committees and the GEF focal points in the countries.  \n \n16.  Regional  coordination.  An  RPMO  will  be  established  within  the  PNG  Department  of \nEnvironment and Conservation, which is also the designated focal point for coordination of the CTI \nregional plan of action. Under the leadership of a regional program manager to be fielded by the \nprogram management consultant, the RPMO will be primarily responsible for overall supervision of \nTA activities in the five countries and for coordination between the NPMUs in the countries and the \nCTI regional secretariat based in Indonesia, as well as between the NPMUs and the TCU based in \nPARD. The RPMO will also prepare regular progress reports for submission to the CTI coordination \ncommittee and the senior officials\u2019 meeting, which will provide oversight supervision for the TA.13    \n \n17.  Consulting  services.  The  TA  will  require  91.5  person-months  of  international  and \n423 person-months of national consulting services (Appendix 3). ADB will engage an international \nprogram  coordinator  on  an  individual  basis  to  serve  for  42  person-months  and  coordinate  TA \nactivities,  including  liaison  with  the  CTI  Secretariat  and  other  relevant  development  partners\u2019 \nactivities in the CTI region. A program management consultant (firm) will be recruited to supply \n91.5 person-months  of  international  and  423  person-months  of  national  consulting  services  to \nsupport in-country program management and implementation in the five Pacific countries. The firm \nwill  also  be  responsible  for  the  management  and  administration  of  various  training  programs, \nworkshops, conferences, and surveys, including subcontracting of various service providers such as \ntraining institutions, local nongovernment organizations, and community-based organizations. To \nensure that a firm with strong technical skills and proven program management experience is \nrecruited by ADB, it will be selected using quality- and cost-based selection evaluation (90:10) \nfollowing ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). In \naddition, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature Oceania, the World Fish Center, and \nthe International Food Policy Research Institute will be engaged on a single source selection basis \nto  conduct  special  studies,  research,  and  other  selected  activities  related  to  climate  change \nadaptation, environmental law and learning, and food security issues for an equivalent of 51 person-\nmonths of consultant inputs (Appendix 3). 14   \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n \n18.\u00a0 The  President  recommends  that  the  Board  approve  (i)  ADB  administering  a  portion  of \ntechnical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $13,100,000 to be financed on a grant basis by \nthe Global Environment Facility, and (ii) ADB providing the balance not exceeding the equivalent of \n$1,950,000 on a grant basis, for Strengthening Coastal and Marine Resources Management in the \nCoral Triangle of the Pacific (Phase 2).\u00a0\n                                                 \n13 A detailed description of the TA implementation arrangements, including the project organization structure and funds \nflow, is in Supplementary Appendix 3. \n14 These are international and/or regional centers of excellence with qualifications, expertise, and experience in the \nidentified fields of study and which have been working on the solution of issues to be addressed by the project.

This appendix provides a summary of the consulting services required during technical \nassistance (TA) implementation and the type of technical services and/or specialist inputs to be \nprovided under five contract packages: (i) one international program coordinator to be hired \ndirectly  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  international,  42  person-months;  (ii)  one \ninternational program management consultant (firm) to be recruited through quality- and cost-\nbased selection (90:10), 91.5 person-months international and 423.0 person-months national;1 \nand (iii) three international organizations: the International Union for the Conservation of Nature \n(IUCN)-Oceania  (20  person-months),  the  World  Fish  Center  (19  person-months),  and  the \nInternational Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) (12 person-months) to be engaged through \nsingle source selection.2 These consultants will be engaged following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The outline terms of reference are \ngiven below and the organization of the consulting services and detailed terms of reference are \nin Supplementary Appendix 4. \n \nB.  International Program Coordinator (individual consultant, 42 person-months) \n 2.  An international program coordinator will be engaged directly by ADB to manage the \noperations of the TA coordination unit at ADB and provide TA and support to the participating \ncountries  during  TA  implementation.  He  or  she  will  (i)  liaise  closely  with  the  program \nmanagement  consultant  (firm)  to  ensure  that  work  planning,  financial  management,  and \nprogram  reporting  are  consistently  applied  using  an  agreed  format  and  agreed  timelines; \n(ii) review work plans and budgets; (iii) review procurement documentation; and (iv) report on \nprogram progress to ADB. He or she will also oversee the implementation of the single source \nselection contract packages (IUCN, World Fish Center, and IFPRI) and the production of their \nrespective deliverables. \n \nC.  Program Management Consultant (firm) (international, 91.5 person-months; national, \n423.0 person-months)  \n3.  An  international  consulting  firm  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  to  serve  as  the  program \nmanagement  consultant  with  responsibility  for  the  provision  of  day-to-day  technical  and \nadministrative support to the national program management units in the participating countries \nin program implementation, including (i) detailed work planning, (ii) coordinating demonstration \nimplementation,  (iii)  procurement  of  goods  and  services,  (iv)  financial  management,  and \n(v) documentation and reporting.

Law and Learning (IUCN, 20 person-months, single source selection) \n \n4.  IUCN (Oceania) will be contracted to support the development of legal capability in the \nCoral Triangle Initiative (CTI)-Pacific countries as part of the wider IUCN Environmental Law \nCommission  Program.  Its  scope  of  work  will  cover  two  main  parts:  strengthening  of \nenvironmental law and facilitated regional learning. Part A will include (i) building public and \nprivate sector environmental law capacity through a regional public sector legal network linked \nto  regional  networks  and  through  awareness  building  and  training,  and  (ii)  supporting  the \nstrengthening of legal governance through development of Environmental Law associations. \nPart B will involve the development of a regional learning forum that will compare progress and \nperformance across countries and then synthesize these into best practices. IUCN as chair of \nthe regional environment roundtable will work with each country program to develop an agreed \ntimeline and format for the regional learning program. It will report on the findings of each \nRoundtable  forum  on  regional  learning  and  how  these  should  be  reflected  in  future  work \nplanning. Their report will be submitted to ADB and the national coordinating committees (for \nCTI countries) and National Advisory Committees (for the non-CTI countries) in a scorecard \nreview format. As best practices are identified, these will be collated into integrated coastal \nresource management best management practice guidelines for dissemination to interested \nparties.  \n \nE.  Climate  Change  Adaptation  (World Fish Center, 19 person-months, single source \nselection)  \n \n5.  WorldFish will provide the services of a team of consultants comprising a policy adviser, \nclimate risk specialist, coastal resources specialist, resource economist, social development \nspecialist, and communications specialist to develop knowledge products on climate change \nand transfer the knowledge and skills to national counterparts. The products to be developed by \nthe team will include (i) guidelines and training materials for the development of future climate \nscenarios using integrated risk characterization; (ii) guidelines and training materials for multi-\nscale vulnerability assessment; and (iii) procedures for climate change adaptation including \npolicy, planning, and implementation. All knowledge products will be institutionalized into the \nintegrated  coastal  resource  management  and  ecosystem-based  fisheries  management \nimplementation programs with technical and training support provided by WorldFish. \n \nF.  Climate Change, Development Strategy, and the Coral Triangle Initiative-Pacific \nCoastal Communities (IFPRI, 12 person-months, single source selection) \n  \n6.  The IFPRI will carry out a study on the economic impacts of climate change on coastal \nand marine resources and use the results of the economic analysis to prepare a development \nstrategy for coastal communities in the CTI-Pacific countries. The study will (i) review the \nrelationship among population, food security, and natural resource use; (ii) include modeling of \n ", "  Appendix 3  15 \nscenarios of population growth, climate change, and their impact on food security and coastal \nand marine resources; (iii) assess current economic development plans to ascertain benefits to \ncoastal  communities;  (iv)  evaluate  the  economic  benefits  of  climate  proofing  for  prototype \nprojects; and (v) formulate strategies for improving food security for coastal communities over \nthe medium to long term. The study will be conducted by a team of specialists in climate change, \nresource economics, food security, and development strategy formulation.   \n \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20101116103359+08'00'", "Author": "rgo", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Producer": "Acrobat Elements 7.0 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20101116103359+08'00'", "Title": "Microsoft Word - RPATA CTI 2 FINAL_15 Nov 2010"}, "author_page": " \n \nABBREVIATIONS \n  ADB  \u2013  Asian Development Bank \n  BMP  \u2013  best management practice \n  CTI  \u2013  Coral Triangle Initiative \n  EBFM  \u2013  ecosystem-based fisheries management \n  GEF  \u2013  Global Environment Facility \n  ICRM  \u2013  integrated coastal resource management \n  IFPRI  \u2013  International Food Policy Research Institute \n  IUCN  \u2013  International Union for the Conservation of Nature \n  km  \u2013  kilometer \n  M&E  \u2013  monitoring and evaluation \n  NGO  \u2013  nongovernmental organization \n  NPMU  \u2013  National Program Management Unit \n  PARD  \u2013  Pacific Department \n  PAS  \u2013  Pacific Alliance for Sustainability \n  PNG  \u2013  Papua New Guinea \n  RCIF  \u2013  Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund \n  RPMO  \u2013  regional program management office \n  TA  \u2013  technical assistance \n  TCU  \u2013  TA coordination unit \n \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CLASSIFICATION \nType  \u2013  Regional\u2014Policy advisory technical assistance (R-PATA) \nTargeting classification  \u2013  Targeted intervention: geographic \nSector (subsector)  \u2013  Agriculture and natural resources (water-based natural resources \nmanagement) \nThemes (subthemes)  \u2013  Environmental sustainability (natural resources conservation), \nregional cooperation and integration (other regional public goods), \ncapacity development (institutional development) \nClimate change  \u2013  Climate change adaptation \nLocation impact  \u2013  national (high), rural (medium), regional (high) \nPartnership  \u2013  Global Environment Facility \n \nNOTE \nIn this report, \u201c$\u201d refers to US dollars. \nVice-President  C.
