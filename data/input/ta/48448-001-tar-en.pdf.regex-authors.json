INTRODUCTION \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will (i) strengthen the research \ncapacity of the Viet Nam Academy of Social Sciences (VASS), and (ii) strengthen VASS\u2019 \nknowledge management and capacity to carry out policy advocacy.1 To strengthen VASS\u2019 \nresearch capacity, the TA project will establish an internal system for research planning and \nquality control within VASS, and will carry out actual research projects to international standards. \nTo strengthen VASS\u2019 knowledge management and policy advocacy capacity, the TA project will \ndevelop a new knowledge management and dissemination plan. This will improve the quality of \npolicy briefs for Viet Nam\u2019s Socioeconomic Development Plan (SEDP) for 2021\u20132025 and bring \nthose briefs more in line with the 17 United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals \n(SDGs).2 \n \n2.  The TA is included in the Asian Development Bank\u2019s country operations business plan for \nViet Nam, 2017\u20132019.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Poverty reduction progress. Robust economic growth over the past 2 decades has \ncontributed to Viet Nam being recognized as a successful development story. From 2007 to 2016, \nper capita income more than doubled in Viet Nam, from $919 to $2,110.4 National poverty rates \nhave been declining for years\u2014from 58.1% in 1990 to 7.0% in 2015.5 However, pockets of chronic \npoverty  persist  in  some  rural  agricultural  areas  and  among  ethnic  minority  groups.  The \ngovernment has adopted a new multidimensional poverty index that measures (i) living conditions, \n(ii) income levels, (iii) access to education and health care, (iv) access to information, and (v) \naccess to social assistance.6 According to this multidimensional poverty index, about 11.35% of \nthe  national  population  is  still  classified  as  poor.  Viet  Nam  has  achieved  its  Millennium \nDevelopment Goal targets to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger, provide universal primary \neducation, promote gender equity, and improve maternal health. Viet Nam has also made positive \nprogress  in  other  health-related  indicators.  Viet  Nam\u2019s  SEDP  for  2016\u20132020  targets  more \ninclusive and environmentally sustainable growth, but the country continues to face several \nchallenges in achieving such growth, including vulnerability to climate change, an underdeveloped \nclean-energy  sector,  low  agricultural  competitiveness,  delays  in  economic  reforms,  and \nunaffordable social services.7 These challenges could slow Viet Nam\u2019s progress in achieving \nSDGs and UN Human Development Index targets.8 \n \n4.  Sustainable  Development  Goals  adoption.  To  demonstrate  its  commitment  to \nachieving  the  SDGs,  the  government  has  established  a  cross-ministerial  SDG  task  force, \nincluding representatives of VASS, to create a national action plan. That plan has singled out 115 \npriority targets out of the 169 targets covered by the 17 SDGs. Among the most urgent targets: \n                                                \n1   The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 6 October 2017. \n2   United Nations. 2015.

New York. \n ", "2 \nstrengthening the government\u2019s research capacity, improving data collection, networking with \nknowledge institutes, and improving policy advocacy vis-\u00e0-vis SDGs. As the key SDG agency, \nVASS has been tasked with (i) developing SDG monitoring indicators, (ii) helping the government \nachieve SDGs through innovative and high-quality knowledge solutions, (iii) designing future \ncountry development plans that are more inclusive and aligned with SDGs, and (iv) monitoring \nand assessing implementation of the SDGs.  \n \n5.  Viet Nam Academy of Social Sciences contribution to inclusive growth. Since its \nestablishment in 1953, VASS has been a key policy advisory body to the national assembly and \nthe Government of Viet Nam. About 1,700 researchers belonging to 30 different institutes and \ncenters under VASS have researched poverty issues.9 Together with the Ministry of Planning and \nInvestment, VASS has been the major author of the country\u2019s SEDPs. VASS also helps write \nfeasibility reports for official development assistance-funded projects and provides evidence-\nbased  advice  on  government  investment  decisions.  Together  with  the  United  Nations \nDevelopment Programme, VASS also issues the annual Viet Nam Human Development Report, \na key government knowledge product and the official data source for SDGs. The report is also \nused for monitoring the implementation of SEDP. \n \n6.  Challenges. As one of the key SDG agencies and authors of Viet Nam\u2019s SEDPs, VASS \nhas faced multiple challenges.  \n \n7.  Limited research capacity. VASS lacks the capacity to create relevant research studies \nthat comply with international standards. VASS researchers often begin research projects without \nclear benchmarks and without a research management plan. There is currently no unified quality \nassurance system for knowledge products within VASS, with each center and institute adopting \ntheir own standards.  Networking opportunities with foreign and regional knowledge institutes are \nlimited, leaving VASS with limited access to the types of sophisticated, international-standard \nresearch methodologies that are needed to address Viet Nam\u2019s complex development challenges. \nAs a result, knowledge solutions and research topics lack innovation and are often supply-driven \nrather than being based on development priorities.  \n \n8.  Weak knowledge services. While the SEDP for 2016\u20132020 supports SDGs, gaps exist \nbetween the SDGs and the development targets identified in the SEDP. Furthermore, the SEDP \ndoes not provide a feasible roadmap for achieving all of the SDGs. VASS will need to address \nthese gaps in the SEDP for 2021\u20132025 by proposing development targets that are more closely \naligned with the SDGs. This will require improving the capacity of VASS to carry out policy \nadvocacy, disseminate knowledge products, and improve its internal knowledge management \nsystem.  Improving  VASS\u2019  capacity  will  also  prepare  VASS  to  be  more  involved  in  official \ndevelopment assistance and concessional loan-financed projects.  \n \n9.  ADB knowledge strategy and value addition. In its 2016\u20132020 country partnership \nstrategy, ADB emphasizes the importance of strengthening knowledge management of Viet \nNam.10 This dovetails with ADB\u2019s strategy to strengthen its support to middle-income countries by \nproviding innovative knowledge solutions. The country knowledge plan for Viet Nam, 2016\u20132020, \n                                                \n9 VASS\u2019 major tasks include (i) conducting a broad range of academic research studies related to poverty reduction \nand inclusive economic growth; (ii) reviewing and providing guidance on national draft strategies, policies, plans, and \nprograms; and (iii) monitoring the implementation of approved policies. \n10 ADB. 2016.

Manila.  \n ", "3 \nrecommends  that  ADB  knowledge  products  and  services  be  more  focused,  strategic,  and \ncoordinated (with other development partners), and that they be disseminated more effectively.11  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The TA will have the following impact: Viet Nam\u2019s national development plan will be more \ninclusive, sustainable, and aligned with the UN\u2019s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and \nthe SDGs.12 The TA will have the following outcome: VASS\u2019 knowledge solutions improved.13  \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities  \n11.  Output 1: Research capacity strengthened. The TA will strengthen VASS\u2019 research \ncapacity by (i) establishing an internal system for research planning and quality control at VASS, \nand (ii) implementing actual research projects to international standards. The TA will support the \ndevelopment of new research manual and the training of VASS management and researchers to \nuse this manual. With a new research management system and support from international \nresearchers, VASS will undertake three research projects that will directly support SDGs and will \ninform future ADB assistance to Viet Nam. These will cover renewable energy, sustainable human \nresource development, and global value chains in the agriculture sector. The three research \nprojects will support the following SDGs: affordable and clean energy (SDG 7), good health and \neducation development (SDGs 3 and 4), gender equality (SDG 5), decent work and economic \ngrowth (SDG 8), responsible consumption and production (SDG 12), and partnership for the goals \n(SDG 17). Development partners that will offer complementary support for this TA include the \nWorld Bank, UN agencies, and bilateral donors. \n \n12.  Output  2:  Knowledge  services  improved.  To  help  strengthen  VASS\u2019  knowledge \nmanagement  and  capacity  in  policy  advocacy,  the  TA  will  (i)  develop  a  new  knowledge \nmanagement and dissemination plan, (ii) implement a new knowledge management system using \ninformation technology solutions, and (iii) support the preparation of SDG-aligned policy briefs to \ninform the SEDP for 2021\u20132025. The new knowledge management system will allow SDG \nprogress to be monitored beyond the TA implementation period, thus helping to ensure the \nsustainability of the TA. Knowledge-enhancing activities will include knowledge dissemination \nworkshops and policy dialogue with other development partners on SDGs and the new SEDP.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,440,000, of which $1,200,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB, and $100,000 will be \nfinanced  on  a  grant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF  6).  The \ngovernment will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, provision of office \nspace, and other in-kind contributions. The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2.  \n \n14.  Under the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction 2017 Policy Guidelines, the following are \nineligible expenditures: (i) purchase of vehicles, (ii) salaries for civil servants, (iii) any foreign \ntravel, (iv) scholarships or long internships, (v) detailed engineering design, (vi) civil works and \n                                                \n11 ADB. 2016.
