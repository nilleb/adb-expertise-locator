INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Asian financial crisis showed that an overdependence on the banking system can \nexacerbate problems for borrowers. Having a deep and liquid bond market will offer borrowers \nthe flexibility to diversify their sources of funding and provide them with an alternative for raising \nlong-term  capital  to  meet  their  long-term  financing  needs.  Local  currency  bond  markets, \ntherefore, help borrowers overcome the currency and maturity mismatches that contributed to \nthe weaknesses of the financial system, as witnessed during the 1997\u20131998 Asian financial \ncrisis. Based on the lessons learned from the crisis, ASEAN+31  launched the Asian Bond \nMarkets Initiative (ABMI) in December 2002 to develop bond markets as an alternative source \n \nof funding to bank loans. \n2.  ASEAN+3 agreed to focus its activities on the four areas viewed as the essential building \nblocks in developing bond markets: (i) the creation of securitized debt instruments, (ii) the \nestablishment of a credit guarantee and investment facility, (iii) the establishment of a regional \nsettlement and clearance system, and (iv) the enhancement of credit rating practices. These \nfour areas aim to boost new issuance of bonds denominated in Asian currencies by the private \nsector, improve credit information on debt issuers in the region to help inform investment \n \ndecisions, and build market infrastructure to support cross-border issuance and investment. \n3.  Much has been achieved since ABMI was launched. The volume of outstanding local \ncurrency-denominated bonds has grown sharply from less than $1 trillion in 2001 to nearly $4.8 \ntrillion by the end of June 2010. By 2008, the local currency bond markets had become an \neffective alternative source of funding for governments and the corporate sector in the region to \nfinance fiscal stimulus programs and meet their financing needs during the financial market \nturmoil. Twenty-five domestic rating agencies across the region were trained on international \nbest practice in rating, and a handbook was provided to domestic rating agencies and regulators \nto help harmonize rating practices. A group of experts completed a study on impediments to \ncross-border bond transactions, and ASEAN+3 and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) worked \ntogether to establish an ASEAN+3 Bond Market Forum (ABMF) to remove these impediments. \nThey are also working to set up a regional credit guarantee and investment facility to provide \ncredit guarantees for issuers that seek to tap into long-term local currency debt markets within \nthe region. \n4.  However, to accelerate the growth of local currency bond markets, ASEAN+3 needs to \nsolve the problem of limited liquidity and a narrow investor base in those markets. While ADB \nprovided regional technical assistance (TA) to explore the possibility of further developing the \nprimary dealer system in the government bond markets to help boost liquidity, ASEAN+3 has \nalso requested TA for assessing how the region could further broaden the investor base to \nsupport  the  local  currency  bond  markets.  The  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in \nAppendix 1. The concept paper of the TA was approved on 9 February 2010.2 \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n1 Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the People's Republic of China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea. \n2 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 15 April 2010. \n ", "2  \nII.  ISSUES \n5  Emerging East Asia has come a long way in promoting investment in local currency \nbond markets. As of March 2010, banks held 56.6% of total outstanding government bonds in \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), 19.1% in Indonesia, 20.4% in the Republic of Korea, \n43.4%  in  Malaysia,  34%  in  Singapore,  and  28.6%  in  Thailand.  Insurance  companies  and \npension funds also play an increasingly important role in shaping the domestic bond markets in \nthese economies. As of March 2010, insurance companies and pension funds held 9.3% of the \ntotal outstanding government bonds in Indonesia, 22% in the Republic of Korea, 36.2% in \nMalaysia, 66.1% in Singapore, and 39.6% in Thailand. \n6.  In the PRC, where insurance companies and pension funds hold only 5.2% of total \noutstanding government bonds, the government recently took several steps to promote investor \ndiversity,  including  allowing  insurance  companies  to  invest  in  instruments  backed  by \ninfrastructure projects and raising the limits for insurance companies to invest in corporate \nbonds. The PRC also continued to liberalize and promote the participation of qualified foreign-\nfunded financial institutions in local debt markets. \n7.  ASEAN+3 wants to broaden the investor base because investor diversity (i) leads to \nmore liquid bond markets, as different investors have different risk perceptions and employ \ndifferent trading strategies; (ii) not only enlarges the size of the market, but can also dampen \nvolatility during periods of market stress; (iii) supports the efficient pooling of long-term funds \nand helps mitigate risk; and (iv) encourages innovation in products and technology, thereby \nreducing transaction costs.  \n8.  Increasing investor diversity in local currency bond markets essentially means promoting \ndomestic  institutional  investors\u2014banks,  insurance  companies,  social  security  and  pension \nfunds, investment funds\u2014as well as attracting foreign investors.  \n9.  The development of contractual savings vehicles is driven largely by the growth of \nliabilities, demographic changes, and welfare policies adopted by governments. Life insurance \ncompanies have a demand for longer-dated bonds based on their long-term liabilities. As the life \ninsurance industry expands in the region, it will help grow the size of local currency bond \nmarkets and extend the maturity profile of benchmark government yield curves. On the other \nhand, nonlife (general) insurance firms tend to expand in line with economic growth, which helps \nboost sales growth in automobile and housing mortgages. \n10.  Pension funds in the region have significant growth potential as the authorities seek to \nmeet the retirement income needs of a rapidly expanding and ageing population. Many of the \npension systems are relatively new and evolving. The oldest pension systems are found in \nMalaysia, the Philippines, and Singapore, but these systems, too, are constantly evolving. The \nRepublic of Korea\u2019s relatively advanced system was established in 1988 and continues to \nundergo reforms. \n11.  The growth of pension funds and the liberalization of pension asset investments will help \ndrive local currency bond markets. Mutual funds are popular vehicles for mobilizing retail funds. \nThey  also manage  the  investments  of other  institutional  investors,  such  as  insurance  and \npension funds. The mutual fund industry has grown and matured in several domestic markets \nand while not all funds are equally developed, some of the most advanced markets can be \nfound  in  the  region.  Sound  regulation  and  pricing  practices  are  important  for  the  smooth \nfunctioning of investment funds, particularly during volatile periods. However, the expansion of \n ", "  3\ncontractual savings vehicles will have to be supported in tandem with overall capital market \ndevelopment. \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The impact of the TA will be the broadening of the investor base. The TA will help \nstrengthen the regional financial system by deepening the bond markets and making them less \nvulnerable to sudden withdrawal of capital by a group of investors. The TA will help amend \npolicies, regulations, and standards that have impeded broader participation by both domestic \nand foreign investors. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The key activities under the TA will be coordinated with the efforts of ADB\u2019s Southeast \nAsia  Department  (SERD)  to  support  capital  market  development  within  the  Association  of \nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Given that broadening the investor base would also require \npromoting  the  development  of  nonbank  financial  institutions  such  as  pension  funds,  the \ninsurance industry, and mutual funds, which is extensive and beyond the scope of this TA, the \nkey activities under this TA will concentrate on the following:    \n(i)  Comprehensive analysis of both the domestic and foreign investor bases for local \ncurrency  bonds  within  ASEAN,  the  PRC,  and  the  Republic  of  Korea.3 This \nincludes classifying investors by type of institutions (e.g., banks, pension and \nsocial security funds, insurance companies, investment funds); by size and by \nrationale of their investment in local currency bonds; and by the potential for \ngreater investment by these investors in ASEAN, the PRC, and the Republic of \nKorea.  The  analysis  will  also  assess  the  factors  that  favor  and  impede \ninvestment by these investors.  \n(ii)  Recommendations, after consultation with regulators and market participants, on \nhow these factors, particularly the regulations and standards, could be reformed \nand  harmonized  to  encourage  broader  participation  by  domestic  and foreign \ninvestors. The recommendations to facilitate foreign investment will (a) take into \naccount the study and recommendations by the group of experts under ABMI on \ncross-border bond transactions, and (b) include measures for the governments to \nconsider to minimize the vulnerability of their economies to sudden withdrawal of \nforeign investment in local currency bonds.  \n(iii)  Comprehensive analysis of mutual funds in ASEAN, the PRC, and the Republic \nof Korea including their market size, policies, and practices to promote retail \ninvestments in local currency bonds. Recommendations on how the policies and \npractices in countries that actively promote retailed investment such as Thailand, \nSingapore, and the Philippines could be further improved to further broaden \ninvestor base and how such measures could be promoted across the region.  \n(iv)  Dissemination of the recommendations to policy makers, regulators and market \nparticipants through workshops, as requested by members. \n                                                \n3 The TA will cover only ASEAN member countries, the PRC, and the Republic of Korea because the bond market \ndevelopment in Japan is well advanced.  \n ", "4  \n(v)  Selection  of  key  policy  makers,  regulators,  and  market  participants  within \nASEAN+3 that are to be invited to the ABMF. Presentation and discussion of the \nTA analyses and the recommendations on broadening the investor base at the \nABMF,  to  encourage  adoption  of  the  recommendations  by  policymakers, \nregulators, and market participants.  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,100,000. It will be financed on a grant basis by the \nInvestment Climate Facilitation Fund under the Regional Cooperation and Integration Financing \nPartnership Facility,4 and administered by ADB. The cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 2.    \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The  TA  will  be  administered  by  the  Office  of  Regional  Economic  Integration  in \ncoordination with ASEAN+3 under the ABMI Task Force 2 work plan. The Office of Regional \nEconomic Integration will also cooperate and exchange information with ADB\u2019s Southeast Asia \nDepartment  on  bond  markets  in  the  ASEAN+3  economies.  The  TA  will  be  disbursed  in \naccordance with ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). The design and monitoring framework in Appendix 1 will be used to track and \nevaluate progress in implementation. The TA will be  implemented over 18 months and is \nexpected to begin in April 2011 and be completed by September 2012.  \n \n16.  The TA will require 21 person-months of international consulting services and 21 person-\nmonths of national consulting services. The consultants will be engaged by ADB as individual \nconsultants in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended \nfrom time to time). The international consultants will include a bond market specialist, who will \nalso be the team leader, and a capital market specialist. National consultants with expertise in \nthe  same  areas  will  be  engaged  for  the  same  length  of  time  to  provide  support  to  the \ninternational consultants. The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3.    \n \n17.  The team leader will coordinate all consultant inputs. The consultants will submit (i) an \ninception report within 1 month of TA commencement; (ii) an interim progress report, including \nanalysis of factors impeding investment in local currency bonds in the markets of ASEAN, the \nPRC, and the Republic of Korea, 5 months after TA commencement; (iii) a draft final report \n12 months after TA commencement; and (iv) a final report after receiving and incorporating \ncomments from ASEAN+3 members and ADB. The progress of the TA project will be discussed \nat the ABMI Task Force 2 meeting and reported to the ABMI steering meeting. The report will \nthen be discussed at the ABMF to encourage adoption of its recommendations. The results and \noutputs will be shared with government officials and market participants through dissemination \nseminars and workshops, as well as with ABMI members in coordination with the Southeast \nAsia Department.   \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n4  Established by the Government of Japan. \n ", "  5\nIV.
