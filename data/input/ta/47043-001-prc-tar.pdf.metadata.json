The  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  requested  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to provide technical assistance (TA) to help make the country\u2019s urban \npension system more sustainable.1 A TA fact-finding mission to Beijing on 23\u201324 July 2013 \nreached  agreement  with  the  government  on  the  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  implementation \narrangements, costs, financial arrangements, and terms of reference for the consulting services \nof the TA. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The aging of its population is a critical challenge to development in the PRC. In 2010, \nthe working-age ratio in the PRC stood at 72.4% and had increased by 13% in the last 3 \ndecades.3 This suggested that the country\u2019s rapidly growing economy had benefitted from a \ndemographic dividend during this period.4 This dividend is expected to begin declining in about \n2015. In addition, the elderly dependency ratio in the PRC is projected to rise from 11.3% in \n2010 to 17% in 2020 and 24% in 2030, which is above current levels in such major developed \ncountries as Canada and the United States.5 Meanwhile, rapid urbanization in the last decade \nhas greatly increased the urban population in the PRC, which reached 51% of the overall \npopulation in 2011. This growth is expected to continue.  \n \n3.  The rapidity and extent of this aging trend raise concerns about the sustainability of the \nPRC\u2019s pension systems. The country\u2019s urban and rural populations are covered by separate \npension systems. The urban pension system was established in 1997.6 The rural system has \nbeen introduced since 2009.7 Sustainability is not a major concern for the rural pension since it \nis designed largely as a social welfare system and requires significant fiscal subsidies from the \ncentral and local governments. The urban pension system consists of a pay-as-you-go (PAYG) \nscheme and individual accounts, which forms a primary economic protection for the majority of \nthe elderly people in the urban areas of the PRC.8 Although the design of the country\u2019s pension \nsystems provides for universal coverage, this is not yet in place. Achieving full coverage will \nincrease  public  expenditures  and  put  additional  stress  on  the  current  pension  system. \nTherefore, there is an urgent need for the PRC to examine the pension system\u2019s sustainability in \nanticipation of the full impact of the demographic transition. \n \n4.  A key factor affecting sustainability of a pension system is the expected duration of \n                                                 \n1   The TA is included in ADB 2013 Country Operations Business Plan: People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), 2013\u2013\n2015. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 2 August 2013.  \n3  The working-age ratio is defined as the ratio of population between 15 and 64 years old to total population. The \ndata in this sentence is from Department of Economics and Social Affairs, the United Nations. \n4  Demographic dividend is a period when a country\u2019s working-age population and the labor force grow more rapidly \nthan the dependent population, and more resources can therefore be invested in economic development. The \ndemographic dividend thereby contributes to the country\u2019s economic development.  \n5  The elderly dependency ratio is defined as the ratio of the population over 65 years old to the population between \n15 and 64 years old. The data in this sentence is from United Nations data website. \nhttp://data.un.org/Data.aspx?d=PopDiv&f=variableID%3A44#PopDiv (accessed on 3 September 2013). \n6  The government established a nationwide basic pension insurance system for the urban population based on \nState Council Document 26 issued in 1997. \n7  Pilots of a new rural pension system have begun in 2009. \n8  Pay as-you-go (PAYG) is a scheme financing defined benefits. Under this scheme, benefits are paid from current \ncontributions and taxes. Individual accounts are the funded financing scheme. Under the individual accounts \nscheme, the defined contribution is funded or saved in the individual account. \n ", "2  \nretirement, which determines length of the period over which pension benefits must be paid.9  A \nrealistic estimate of life expectancy after retirement age is important to keep a pension system \nsustainable.  In  member  countries  of  the  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and \nDevelopment (OECD), average life expectancy after formal retirement age was 18.5 years for \nmen and 23.3 years for women as of 2010.10 Based on the PRC\u2019s current formal retirement age, \nlife expectancy after retirement age is 20.7 years for men and 25.7 years for women.11 To \nmaintain the sustainability of their pension systems, most OECD countries have committed to \nraise the retirement age to bring it more in line with increases in life expectancy. The PRC may \nalso need to review the formal retirement age on the ongoing efforts to strengthen sustainability \nof its urban pension system. \n \n5.  In addition, the effective retirement age is closely related to the years of contribution \nrequired for full pension benefits.12  Some countries set both a minimum number of contribution \nyears  for  pension  benefit  eligibility  and  contribution  years  for  qualification  for  full  benefits. \nBenefits for pensioners whose contribution years are less than the required years for the full \nbenefits are reduced based on the specified calculation. The required contribution years for full \npension benefits vary across countries. For example, it is about 10 years in the United States, \n25 years in Turkey, 30 years in the United Kingdom, 40 years in Japan, and 41 years in France. \nAn individual needs to contribute for 15 years to qualify for a PAYG urban pension under the \ncurrent pension system in the PRC.13 In general, the short contribution period requirement \nmotivates  people  to  retire  before  the  formal  retirement  age.  Setting  conditions  for  early \nretirement, such as a minimum eligible age and reduced benefits, can have an effect on the \nchoice of the effective retirement age. The levels of the contributions required and the benefits \npaid  out  are  other  key  factors  in  determining  a  pension  scheme\u2019s  sustainability.  These \nparameters also need to be examined to strengthen the PRC\u2019s urban pension system. \n \n6.  As urban pension schemes are managed at province and municipality levels in the PRC, \nthere are no reliable aggregated projections on net pension liabilities for the whole country.14 \nNet liabilities are not recognized in accounting terms until the obligation to pay arises. Under \nPAYG  schemes,  the  contributions  are  used  to  pay  the  current  pension  recipients  but  not \naccumulated for future pension payments for the contributors. Therefore, net pension liabilities \nmay arise under the PAYG scheme, if the number of pensioners increases and becomes more \nthan contributors due to a change in demographic structure. Liabilities generally do not arise \nunder  the  individual  account  scheme  because  the  individual\u2019s  contribution  is  saved  in  the \nindividual account to fund the future benefit payment. However, the current PRC individual \naccount scheme assumes post-retirement life to be 120 months. If the individual lives longer \nthan  120  months,  the PAYG  scheme  is  required  to  continue  financing  pension  payments. \nTherefore, the individual account scheme has also become partially unfunded in the PRC \nbecause of the increase in life expectancy.   \n \n7.  The lack of reliable projections on aggregated liabilities makes it difficult to properly \nassess the sustainability of the PRC\u2019s urban pension system. It also raises concerns about \n                                                 \n9  This factor is an important determination of costs in paying for pensions. \n10  The average life expectancy at age 65 is 83.1 years in member countries of the OECD. \n11  The life expectancy at age 65 is 80.7 years in the PRC (OECD. 2011. Pension at a Glance 2011: Retirement-\nincome Systems in OECD and G20 Countries. Paris). The formal retirement age is 60 years for men and 55 years \nfor women under the current urban pension system in the PRC. \n12   The effective retirement age or the actual retirement age refers to the age of retirement actually observed.  \n13  Pensioners whose contribution years are less than 15 years receive benefits only from the individual accounts but \nnot from the PAYG scheme in the PRC. \n14   Net pension liabilities are future net liabilities under unfunded pension schemes. \n ", "  3\nwhether the National Social Security Fund (NSSF), established in 2000 as a national long-term \nstrategic reserve fund to meet future pension obligations, has enough resources to meet those \nobligations.15 Total NSSF assets increased rapidly during 2000\u20132011 from 0.2% to 1.8% of \ngross domestic product. It is considered important that the NSSF is adequately resourced when \nit takes on responsibility for major pension expenditures in about 2030, but its ability to meet \nthese needs cannot be known without reliable projections of pension liabilities. The PRC needs \nto develop these projections to assess the sustainability of the urban pension system and the \nasset level of the NSSF. \n \n8.  ADB\u2019s country partnership and strategy, 2011\u20132015 for the PRC promotes inclusive \ngrowth as one of its three strategic pillars.16 A sound pension system will provide economic \nprotection for the elderly, which contributes to achieving the inclusive growth. The purpose of \nthe TA will provide the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security (MOHRSS) with \nrecommendations  for  strengthening  the  sustainability  of  the  urban  pension  system.  It  will \ncontinue ADB\u2019s support for pension reforms in the PRC since the mid-1990s.17 ADB\u2019s previous \nsupport helped expand the rural pension system and improved its administration. The proposed \nTA provides further assistance to MOHRSS in strengthening the sustainability of the urban \npension system.  \n \n9.  The TA will examine the following key issues: (i) the adequate retirement age; (ii) the \nnumber of required years of contributions, and the adequate levels of contributions and benefits; \n(iii) disincentives for early retirement; (iv) the projection of pension liabilities and of the scale of \nthe NSSF\u2019s future assets; and (v) public opinion on potential pension reforms. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact will be improved sustainability of the urban pension system while ensuring \nadequate benefits. This will be measured by adoption of recommendations that emerge from the \nTA. The outcome will be improved framework of the urban pension system for strengthening its \nsustainability.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA will achieve the outcome through six major outputs:   \n \n(i)  Analysis of the sustainability of the PRC urban pension system with a focus on \nretirement  age,  required  years  of  contribution  payment,  disincentives  for  early \nretirement,  and  the  levels  of  contributions  and  benefits.  The  analysis  will  also \nexamine the impact of unifying the retirement age between men and women. \n(ii)  Analysis  of  international  practices  on  strengthening  pension  sustainability.  The \nanalysis will focus on: retirement age, including gender difference in retirement age; \nthe required years of contribution payment; disincentives for early retirement; and \n                                                 \n15  The National Social Security Fund is a public pension reserve fund that is expected to play a major role in the \nfuture financing of public pension systems and thus alleviate the impact of population aging on public finance. \n16    ADB. 2012.

To deliver the planned outputs, the consulting team leader will develop a detailed work \nplan in consultation with the MOHRSS. The consulting team will analyze the sustainability of the \nPRC pension system for urban employees.18 The survey to be conducted by the team in several \nprovinces will investigate public opinion on potential pension reforms. Based on the analyses, \nthe consulting team will formulate recommendations for strengthening the sustainability of the \nurban pension system in the PRC, providing scenarios for the pension liabilities based on the \noptions proposed.  \n \n13.  The TA will include an international study tour to observe international good practices. \nWorkshops will be organized at various stages of project implementation to enhance awareness \nof key issues for the relevant government officials. The workshops will include but not be limited \nto an interim workshop and a final workshop. The MOHRSS will also ensure that finalized reports \non the analyses and the recommendations are circulated to all relevant government agencies.    \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost the equivalent of $430,000, of which $400,000 will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADB's Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). \nThe government will provide counterpart support in the form of office accommodation, data and \ndocuments for the consultants; counterpart staff; logistical support, including costs of selected \ntranslation and meeting arrangements; and other related services. Detailed cost estimates are \nin Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months from 21 October 2013 to 20 October 2015. \nThe MOHRSS will be the executing agency.  \n16.  The TA will cover remuneration, travel, and per diem of consultants, as well as the costs \nof workshops, seminars, the study tour, and miscellaneous expenses.
