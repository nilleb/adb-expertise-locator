During  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB)  operational  missions  in  2002,  the \nGovernment of Cambodia requested technical assistance (TA) for building the capacity of \nElectricity Authority of Cambodia (EAC), the new independent electricity sector regulator, to \ndevelop transparent policies, guidelines, and procedures for setting tariffs for electricity supply. \nWhile it was not included in the Country Strategy and Program Update (CSPU), the advisory TA \nwas endorsed by the Vice President (Operations 1) on 3 June 2003 and is now included in the \n2003 program. An ADB Fact-Finding Mission visited Cambodia during 4\u201317 June 2003 and \nreached  an  understanding  with  the  Government  on  the  objective,  scope,  cost,  financing, \nimplementation arrangements, and the consultants\u2019 terms of reference for the TA.1 The TA \nframework is attached as Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.    Damaged by years of war and neglect, the electricity supply system in Cambodia is \npresently  fragmented  and  extremely  varied.  A  sizable  portion  of  demand  continues  to  be \nsupplied  from  small  and  medium-size  generators  owned  by  consumers  and  small  private \nenterprises. This means that the national electricity supply is unreliable and operators cannot \ncapture economies of scale. The average retail electricity tariff in Phnom Penh is $0.15 per \nkilowatt-hour (kWh), while tariffs in provincial areas outside of Phnom Penh range from $0.30 to \n$0.92/kWh. These tariffs rank among the highest in the region.  Despite  the  Government's \nefforts, its institutions require further development, and power supply is costly, unreliable, and \nlimited mostly to urban areas and towns. Over the past decade, assistance from ADB and other \ninternational  finance  institutions  has  primarily  focused  on  rehabilitating  generation  and \ndistribution systems in Phnom Penh and developing similar systems in larger provincial towns to \nreduce the cost of electricity. In recent years, lenders have provided assistance for institutional \nstrengthening to clarify the sector roles of the Government and provincial authorities, promote \nprivate sector participation under a more transparent framework, commercialize state-owned \npower utilities and reduce their operational inefficiencies, and facilitate subregional integration. \n \n3.    The new Electricity Law of Cambodia, promulgated in 2001, defined the management \nand regulation of activities in relation to the supply and consumption of electricity. In effect, the \nlaw  outlined  the  institutional  restructuring  of  the  sector  by  clarifying  and  segregating  the \nGovernment's role as a regulator, policy maker, electricity supplier, and investor. One of the \nmain purposes of the law was to establish the EAC as an autonomous public agency to regulate \nelectricity  services  and  to  govern  the  relation  between  the  delivery,  receipt,  and  use  of \nelectricity. EAC\u2019s main duties are licensing participants and approving their tariffs and other \nterms and conditions of electric power service. EAC will ensure that the provision of electric \npower  services  will  be  governed  by  the  principles  of  efficiency,  quality,  continuity,  and \ntransparency.  The  Ministry  of  Industry,  Mines  and  Energy  (MIME)  would  maintain  its \nresponsibility for policy management and for strategies and planning for the Government in the \npower sector.  \n \n4.    ADB\u2019s  CSPU  for  Cambodia  indicates  that  ADB  will  support  the  development  of \ninfrastructure and promote an enabling environment for private sector participation. In 2000, \nADB approved the Provincial  Power Supply Project2 to support Electricit\u00e9 du Cambodge\u2019s \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) in June 2003.  \n2  ADB. 2001. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nKingdom of Cambodia for the Provincial Power Supply. Manila. ", "2 \n(EDC)  rehabilitation  of  electricity  supply  systems  in  eight  towns  to  stimulate  the  local \neconomies.  The  upgraded  systems  will  lower  electricity  costs  under  EDC  supply,  provide \nreliable electricity and strengthen the local network so that entrepreneurs can connect to the \nsupply. ADB is currently preparing the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Power Transmission \nProject, which will construct a 220-kilovolt transmission line between Viet Nam and Cambodia. \nThe GMS Project will allow Cambodia to import substantially cheaper electricity to the Phnom \nPenh area. Upgraded systems and imports from Cambodia will help reduce the cost and \nimprove the quality of electricity service.     \n \n5.    However, the Electricity Law stipulates it is EAC\u2019s responsibility to set tariffs to ensure \nthat consumers will benefit from these improvements and will be protected from arbitrary pricing.  \nUntil the law was passed and EAC established, the Government permitted full cost recovery \npricing in provincial areas, while retail tariffs in Phnom Penh were not adjusted regularly for full \ncost recovery. EAC is responsible for establishing principles and policies for the operation of the \nelectricity sector as well as licensing participants for reliable and safe provision of electricity to \nconsumers.  Cambodia  is  in  a  unique  situation  in  that  it  already  has  substantial  private \nparticipation in electrification through an estimated 600\u20131,000 private rural electricity enterprises \n(REEs) operating on the periphery of provincial towns and in rural areas. While the REEs are \nrelatively small, fragmented private sector enterprises, they provide an essential basic service in \nrural areas. Presently, REEs operate under a harsh business environment with limited access to \ncapital, limited short-term operating permissions, and an uncertain regulatory environment that \nresults in high tariffs. The high tariffs severely affect affordability to poor consumers and \nconstrain demand, with consequential implications for rural development and poverty reduction. \nA clear tariff-setting mechanism will create incentives for the private sector to reduce costs and \nbecome more efficient in its operations, and, most importantly, ensure that end consumers \nbenefit from investments in the sector.    \n  \n6.  While EAC has been operational since late 2001, it has focused its capabilities on \nissuing long-term licenses to the larger operators in Cambodia (e.g., EDC\u2019s Phnom Penh \noperations,  EDC\u2019s  provincial  town  service  areas,  and  independent  power  producer  [IPP] \ngenerators). It is only now beginning to review and issue longer-term licenses to some of the \nREEs, which will also encourage further investment and price reductions. EAC has issued the \nGeneral Conditions of Supply in late 2002 and recently issued procedures for issuing and \nrevising licenses. The license procedures include a public consultation process to review and \ncomment on proposed licenses. Information of this nature is also regularly posted on its Internet \nweb  site  and  physically  posted  in  service  locations.  Assistance  for  clarifying  licensing \nprocedures and setting technical service standards has been provided under World Bank \nfunding.  However,  EAC  has  been  unable  to  fully  develop  those  policies,  procedures  and \nguidelines for tariff setting that will promote efficiency, transparency, and affordable supply of \nelectricity. ADB support is needed to strengthen EAC\u2019s capabilities as an effective sector \nregulator and promote good governance in the sector. A regulator\u2019s ability to provide effective \noversight depends significantly on the strength of its technical capabilities. Therefore, this TA \nexpects  to  familiarize  EAC  with  international  good  practices  and  standards  in  regulatory \nfunctions. In addition, the TA will strengthen consumer and stakeholder participation in the \nprocess to further demonstrate the regulator\u2019s intent to protect all consumers and promote \ntransparency and accountability in the sector.   \n ", "    3 \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n7.    The TA will strengthen EAC\u2019s capacity to discharge its tariff-setting responsibilities \nmandated in the Electricity Law and function as an effective independent regulator of electricity \nsupply in Cambodia. The TA will be realized through the following components and output:  \n(i) development of transparent electricity pricing guidelines and regulatory methodology for  \ntariff-setting; (ii) operational support to EAC on policies, procedures, and specific guidelines for \neffective monitoring of licensees; (iii) training on international tariff-setting methodologies and \nfinancial monitoring mechanisms; and (iv) stakeholder participation workshops on tariff setting \nand design of an information dissemination campaign to consumers. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.    The electricity pricing guidelines and tariff-setting strategy will be developed, presented, \nand  discussed  with  stakeholders,  taking  into  account  the  current  structure  of  Cambodia\u2019s \nelectricity market and heterogeneous type of licensees.3 Due to these attributes, two tariff \nsetting procedures may need to be developed, which will be consistent with the basic economic \nprinciple of regulation. Once the guidelines have been developed in conjunction with EAC, the \nconsultants will assist EAC staff in drafting the subdecree for MIME\u2019s and EAC\u2019s review and \njoint submission to the Government for approval. The subdecree, which is required by the \nElectricity Law, will outline the principles of tariff setting and what costs of electricity production \nand distribution can be recovered through the tariff.   \n \n9.    The consultants will also provide operational support and in-house training for EAC staff. \nFirst, they will hold an in-house training seminar on key aspects of forms of economic regulation \nand applications to Cambodia. Once guidelines have been developed, the consultants will give \nEAC\u2019s financial and technical staff on-the-job training in the processes and procedures. In \nparticular, the consultants will demonstrate how Excel-based computer models can be used to \nmonitor financial performance and how to analyze performance indicators. \n  \n10.   Establishing an effective regulatory mechanism requires interaction and participation \nwith  all  stakeholders:  the  Government,  public  utilities,  private  sector  operators,  advocacy \ngroups, and consumers. In drafting the guidelines, the consultants will present international \ngood practices in participatory approaches in regulation, so that EAC appreciates the potential \npitfalls of tariff setting, which changes are often politically charged issues and have a direct \nimpact on the poor. The consultants will assist EAC plan, design, and carry out a public \nstakeholder workshop on methods of regulation, proposed tariff-setting methodologies, and \npotential impacts on actual tariffs. The consultants will discuss with EAC the feedback collected \nfrom these meetings and determine any midcourse adjustments to address concerns before the \nguidelines are finalized. As part of drafting the guidelines, the consultants will assist EAC in \ndesigning an information campaign to disseminate the results and explain the tariff-setting \nprocess.  These  workshops  will  help  strengthen  public  confidence  that  EAC  intends  to \ntransparently set tariffs that protect consumers as well as ensure that licensees can recover \ncosts. It is important to note that the workshops must be driven by EAC and the consultants to \nensure Government sense of ownership of the process and to build credibility. \n                                                 \n3  Cambodia has several large licensees, including EDC and nidependent power producers, which collectively \nprovide electricity to Phnom Penh and other major populated areas. However, the remainder of the provincial and \nrural areas are served by the numerous REEs. It may not be practical or possible for EAC to require (and \nsubsequently review) the same detailed information from REEs as from the larger licensees. ", "4 \n11.   The above activities constitute the first phase of  the tariff-setting process, in which \nguidelines in the form of the subdecree will be developed and presented to the Government for \napproval. Once the subdecree is approved, there is the risk that EAC staff\u2019s technical and \nfinancial skills may still be insufficient to carry out the detailed review and tariff-setting process. \nTo mitigate this risk, further TA is planned to assist EAC through the implementation phase of \nthe tariff-setting mechanisms. While EAC has indicated its intent to pursue other grant funding \nfor this next phase (and commits to keep ADB informed of progress), an allocation to finance \nthis subsequent assistance has been made from the expected loan proceeds of the GMS \nTransmission Project, scheduled for Board presentation in the fourth quarter of 2003. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $300,000  equivalent  comprising  foreign \nexchange  of  $229,500  and  local  currency  equivalent  of  $70,500.  The  Government  has \nrequested ADB to finance the entire foreign exchange cost of $229,500 and $10,500 equivalent \nof the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Governance \nCooperation Fund, to be administered by ADB. The Executing Agency, EAC, will finance the \nbalance of the local currency cost, equivalent to $60,000, by providing office accommodations \nand  facilities,  local  communication,  counterpart  staff,  secretarial  support,  data  and  other \ninformation needed for the TA. Detailed cost estimates and the financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  EAC will be the Executing Agency for the TA. To ensure a close working relationship, \nthe consultants will work in EAC\u2019s offices in Phnom Penh. EAC will provide counterpart staff to \nwork with the consultants and will make proper arrangements for office space, secretarial \nsupport, and local transportation for site visits. EAC will provide necessary assistance to the \nconsultants  in  liaising  with  other  Government  ministries  and  agencies,  and  in  obtaining \nnecessary data and documentation. EAC will also provide available operating and financial \ninformation on licensees to ensure that the consultants have a clear understanding of the \ncurrent electricity market before making recommendations on regulatory processes.   \n \n14.  The TA will require approximately 7 person-months of international consulting services.  \nIt will be implemented over 6 months starting in November 2003 and ending in April 2004. \nOutline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. It is envisaged that a team \nconsisting  of  a  regulatory  economist  and  a  financial  analyst  will  carry  out  the  TA.  The \nconsultants will have expertise in regulating electric utilities, private sector participation, utility \nfinancial  analysis  and  tariff-setting  methodologies,  and  process-oriented  training.  ADB  will \nengage  a  consulting  firm  in  accordance  with  its  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants. \nConsultants will be recruited under the quality- and cost-based selection procedures, and \nsimplified technical proposals will be requested. There will be no procurement under this TA. \n \n15.  Deliverables  will  be  disseminated  through  stakeholder  workshops  to  discuss  tariff \nmethodologies and appropriate approaches for Cambodia, considering its unique situation. The \nworkshops will help build the credibility of EAC in moving forward with its decisions, which will \nbe integrated into the subdecree. In the course of the TA, EAC staff will also be trained on \nprocedures for internal review, financial analysis of submissions by licensees, and decision-\nmaking processes. Results will also be conveyed through an end-consumer dissemination \ncampaign designed under the TA. \n ", "    5 \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $240,000 to the Government \nof Cambodia to be financed on a grant basis by the Governance Cooperation Fund for the \npurpose of Capacity Building of Electricity Authority of Cambodia, and hereby reports this action \nto the Board.

Introduction \n \n1.  A  team  of  international  consultants  will  carry  out  the  technical  assistance  (TA)  to \nElectricity Authority of Cambodia (EAC) over 6 months. It is envisaged that the team will consist \nof one regulatory economist (4 person-months) and one financial analyst (3 person-months). \nThe regulatory economist will be the team leader and will be responsible for managing the TA \nand submitting all deliverables according to schedule. The consultants will have expertise in \nregulating electric utilities, private sector participation, utility financial analysis and tariff-setting \nmethodologies, and process-oriented training. \nB.  Scope of Work \n \n2.  The work covers four major areas. The consultants must review the scope of work \nbefore their services start and make any recommendations to the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) to ensure completion of deliverables in a cost-effective manner.  \n \n1.  Review  of  Electricity  Supply  Market  and  Proposals  for  Tariff-Setting \nPrinciples and Methodology \n3.  The consultants will undertake these tasks: \n \n(i)  Review  the  requirements  and  authority  provided  to  EAC  under  the \nElectricity  Law  (2001),  EAC\u2019s  General  Conditions  of  Supply,  EAC\u2019s \nlicensing procedures, and all other information on Cambodia\u2019s electricity \nsector. \n(ii)  Present issue-based discussion papers to EAC on various economic and \nfinancial  approaches  to  regulation,  tariff-setting  principles,  and \ninternational good practices. \n(iii)  Recommend specific tariff-setting policies and guidelines for Cambodia, \nincorporating the principles of cost recovery, efficiency, reliability, and \ntransparency. The approach must consider what is an appropriate and \npractical method of tariff regulation that will cover large licensees with \ndetailed information and rural electricity enterprises (REEs) with limited \ninformation. \n(iv)  Comment on the draft tariff application containing the public consultation \nprocess of tariff review and approval, and procedures for customers and \nother interested parties to comment on the applications. \n \n2.  Operational Support to EAC \n4.  The consultants\u2019 specific tasks are as follows. \n \n(i)  Propose evidentiary requirements for tariff submission and time frame for \ndecisions. Propose procedures for EAC to obtain additional information \nfrom licensees as necessary to evaluate tariff applications. \n(ii)  Develop Excel-based computer models for analyzing financial information \nand tariff applications from licensees. \n(iii)  Assist  EAC  officials  draft  the  Electricity  Law  subdecree  on  electricity \npricing costs. \n ", "10  Appendix 3 \n(iv)  Draft  a  uniform  and  standardized  application  for  tariff  approval  and \nsubmission of accounts for financial monitoring, based on International \nAccounting Standards. \n \n3.  Internal EAC Training \n5.  The consultants\u2019 tasks are as follows. \n \n(i)  Train EAC staff on the key aspects of economic and financial regulation, \nprinciples, and methods. \n(ii)  Offer  training  on  how  to  evaluate  the  different  costs  of  electricity \nproduction and supply so that, as much as possible, uniform categories \ncan be used. \n(iii)  Train financial staff to use Excel-based computer models for financial \nanalysis and modeling of alternative revenue/tariff scenarios. \n(iv)  Provide training on how to apply the same computer models to facilitate \nEAC\u2019s compliance monitoring on an ongoing basis. \n \n4.  Stakeholder Workshops and Design of Information Dissemination \n6.  The consultants\u2019 tasks are as follows. \n \n(i)  Before finalizing the tariff-setting guidelines and subdecree, conduct a \npublic  consultation  workshop  on  methods  of  regulation  and  gather \nfeedback  on  the  recommended  strategy.  The  methodology  to  be \nproposed should be made available in advance to stakeholders for their \ncomment. \n(ii)  Conduct at least one, or preferably 2\u20133 field visits or workshops with \nREEs to understand the provincial operating and business environment, \nwhich may affect recommendations on regulatory design. Additional field \nvisits and consultations will be held as can be accommodated in the \nbudget. \n(iii)  Design an information dissemination campaign for EAC to implement \nonce the subdecree is approved. The campaign should be designed to \nallow for additional feedback from stakeholders (especially consumers) to \nensure that the process is fully understood. \n \nC.  Reporting Requirements \n \n7.  Within 2 weeks of the start of services, the consultant will submit an inception report, \nwhich outlines the work to be undertaken and highlights any issues that require ADB\u2019s and \nEAC\u2019s feedback. Two months after the start, the consultant will issue an interim report, which \nwill indicate progress on the scope of work and any discussion papers and presentations \ncompleted. Four months after the start of services, the consultant will submit a draft final report \nincluding (i) proposed guidelines, policies, and procedures for tariff setting; (ii) a draft subdecree \non electricity pricing costs; (iii) Excel-based computer models for financial monitoring and \nanalysis of licensees; (iv) proposed templates for financial reporting and application for tariff \napproval; (v) a summary of results of the public consultation meetings; and (vi) design of the \ninformation dissemination campaign. Three weeks after receiving comments from ADB and \nEAC, the consultant will submit the final report integrating such comments.
