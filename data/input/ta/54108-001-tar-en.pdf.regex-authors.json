THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FACILITY \n \nA.  Justification \n1.  The Proposal \n1.  The proposed transaction technical assistance (TA) facility will support the Government \nof Bangladesh during 2020\u20132022 to improve performance of the country\u2019s energy sector through \ntechnical, policy and capacity development support for investment projects in power and gas \nsectors.1 During this period, Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) energy portfolio in Bangladesh is \nexpected to increase by $1.7 billion, equivalent to the current ADB portfolio developed during \n2015-2020.2 \n2.  The TA facility will combine the preparation of various projects in Bangladesh during 2020-\n2022.  Such  an  approach  is  expected  to  result  in  a  better-performing  energy  portfolio  in \nBangladesh than would be achieved through project-specific TA because of improved (i) response \ntime by providing the country with consistent energy solutions; (ii) quality of outputs through \nefficient delivery systems; (iii) sector assessment and policy support; and (iv) knowledge sharing \nacross sub-sectors. These improvements, including administrative efficiency, will be achieved \nthrough the use of a common pool of high-quality consultants as due diligence requirements are \nsimilar across energy sector projects.   \n3.  The TA facility is in line with the recommendations of the ADB\u2019s policy paper to enhance \noperational efficiency,3 and will increase (i) optimization of ADB resource use by effectively \nprioritizing TA resource allocation and improving project design quality; (ii) project implementation \neffectiveness by reducing delays in project implementation, promoting cost-efficient procurement \nof services, and optimizing the value addition of consultant services; and (iii) administrative cost-\neffectiveness. \n2.  Sector Constraints and Opportunities \n4.  Bangladesh  has  achieved  consistent  and  steady  economic  growth,  with  real  gross \ndomestic product (GDP) estimated at 7.1% in fiscal year (FY) 2016, 7.3% in FY2017, and 7.8% \nin FY2018. The government aims to accelerate the growth to 8.0%, on average, between now \nand 2021. The structure of the Bangladesh economy is gradually shifting from agriculture to \nmanufacturing and services. The industrial growth rate is also expected to increase to 10.9% from \n9.6%  during  the  same  period.  Availability  of  adequate  and  affordable  energy  is  a  major \nimpediment in achieving the country\u2019s growth and development objectives. \n5.  Power. The power sector in Bangladesh is characterized by recurring shortages of \nelectricity generating capacity in the face of ever-rising demand in a growing economy. In FY2015, \nper capita electricity consumption was 310 kilowatt-hours (kWh); this was lower than most of the \nother countries in South Asia, indicating that power sector infrastructure facilities in Bangladesh \nrequire significant capacity additions.4 In tandem with increasing power generation capacity, \n \n1  A list of ensuing projects supported by the TA facility is detailed in Appendix 2. The ensuing projects and respective \npreparatory TAs are listed in Bangladesh\u2019s Country Operations Business Plan, 2020\u20132022.   \n2  See footnote 1 and ADB Data Library https://data.adb.org/dataset/adb-sovereign-projects (accessed 23 February \n2020. \n3  ADB. 2015. Enhancing Operational Efficiency of the Asian Development Bank. Manila. \n4  Annual per capita consumption levels reported in 2015 by other countries in the region were as follows: Bhutan 3,039 \nkWh, India 800 kWh, Maldives 558 kWh, Sri Lanka 530 kWh, and Nepal 140 kWh. \n \n ", "2   \n \ninvestments in the transmission and distribution networks are crucial to address bottlenecks for \nthe evacuation of bulk power from power stations to major load centers and further uninterrupted \ndelivery to end users. \n6.  To  this  end,  the  government,  following  its  Power  System  Master  Plan  2016,5has \ndeveloped series of investment projects to expand national power transmission network as well \nas increase capacity of its power distribution systems. Sustainable and Reliable Power Supply \nProject  (SRPSP)  proposed  by  the  government  is  part  of  this  investment  plan  to  address \nconstraints in power transmission and distribution sector, and ADB was requested to provide $550 \nmillion to finance the project. \n7.  Renewable Energy. Bangladesh\u2019s renewable energy potential is estimated at 3,666 \nmegawatt (MW).6 The country has been slow in developing renewable energy, despite  its \nRenewable Energy Policy\u2019s,7 and Vision 2021\u2019s plan to generate up to 10% of its power from \nrenewable energy by 2021. 8 Land acquisition has been a major hurdle in developing utility scale \nsolar photovoltaic power plants, as existing land policy restricts the use of agricultural land for \nlarge  solar  power  plants.  The  government  has  encouraged  private  sector  participation  in \nrenewable energy development through competitive bidding and unsolicited proposals. However, \nonly a few of the proposed projects have advanced due to land constraints and inability to reach \nfinancial closure. \n8.  The government is committed to meeting its Nationally Determined Contributions under \nthe Paris Climate Accord, which includes reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 5% by 2030 \nfrom the business-as-usual case. To meet this target, installation of up to 1,000 MW of renewable \nenergy generation capacities is planned for medium-term development. However, given land \nconstraints and the government\u2019s policy to retain as much land as possible for agriculture, utility \nscale solar photovoltaic power plants can be constructed only on marginal land, which poses big \nchallenges for future scaling up. Floating solar photovoltaic power systems are ideal solution for \nBangladesh as they do not compete with agricultural land, do not suffer from efficiency penalties \ncaused  by  high  ambient  temperatures,  and  can  be  quickly  deployed  and  built  in  stages. \nBangladesh has large water reservoirs, but the potential of floating solar photovoltaic power has \nnot yet been fully explored. \n9.  Through its ongoing TA, ADB, together with the government, is assessing floating solar \nphotovoltaic power potential, developing an investment plan covering solar, wind, biomass, and \nother renewable energy resources that complements both the government\u2019s climate change \ncommitments and energy sector interventions by ADB.9 Currently, the TA has identified and \nshortlisted several locations favorable for floating solar systems, wind, small hydro and biomass \nenergy generation. The government is planning to conceptualize these projects and initially seeks \n \n5  Government of Bangladesh, Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources. 2016.

Energy efficiency. Bangladesh is one of the most energy-intensive countries in South \nAsia. The final energy consumption tripled over the past decade. Industrial growth has been one \nof the key drivers of Bangladesh\u2019s increasing energy intensity, accounting for 47% or almost half \nof the final energy use. Considering the development scenario, Bangladesh\u2019s emissions are \nexpected to increase dramatically by 2030. The government recognized the importance of green \ngrowth and passed the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Master Plan up to 2030 (EECMP), \nwhich aims to restructure and improve economic institutions toward more efficient use of natural \nresources  and  improved  competitiveness  of  the  economy,  which  will  be  achieved  through \nincreased investments in technological innovation, natural capital, and economic instruments. \nThis will contribute to responding to climate change, reducing poverty, and addressing sustainable \neconomic development challenges. One of the important strategic objectives is to reduce primary \nenergy consumption per GDP (energy intensity) by 15% by 2021 and 20% by 2030 compared to \nthe 2013 level. \n11.  Several development partners including ADB, Japan International Cooperation Agency, \nand  Deutsche  Gesellshaft  f\u00fcr  Internationale  Zusammenarbeit  (GIZ)  have  supported \nimplementation of the core actions of EECMP. In December 2016, ADB approved a regional TA \nfor improving institutional capacity in preparing energy efficiency investments in five countries in \nSouth Asia including Bangladesh aiming to develop energy efficiency investment pipelines for the \nnext  5  years.10 A  study  conducted  under  this  TA  revealed  that  large  energy  efficiency \nopportunities exist in the Bangladesh textile, garment, cement, iron and steel manufacturing \nindustries as well as in buildings. The total energy efficiency investment potential in selected \nsolutions over the next 5 years in Bangladesh is estimated at $2.25 billion, focused almost wholly \non the industry and building sectors. \n12.  Energy efficiency and conservation are crucial in Bangladesh to (i) help the country in \naddressing the multiple challenges facing the energy sector; (ii) improve energy intensity in the \neconomy by effectively curtailing energy demand growth; (iii) make electricity available universally; \nand (iv) meet its climate change goals. To address the issues, the government requested ADB to \nprovide a credit line that would facilitate investment in energy efficiency solutions with preferential \nterms that will stimulate energy efficiency and conservation investments under item (iv) of the \nEECMP as well as a technical assistance loan to implement the remaining core actions identified \nin the EECMP. ADB aims to provide such credit line under the Scaling Up Energy Efficiency and \nConservation Project (SUEECP) which is expected to be approved in 2020. \n3.  Delivering Solutions and Facility Outcomes \n13.  The TA facility is aligned with the ADB Strategy 2030\u2019s operational priorities and will \nsupport the delivery of solutions for (i) tackling climate change, building climate and disaster \nresilience,  and  enhancing  environmental  sustainability;  (ii)  making  cities  more  livable;  (iii) \nstrengthening  governance  and  institutional  capacity; (iv)  fostering  regional  cooperation  and \nintegration; and (v) accelerating progress in gender equality. \n14.  The TA facility will deliver energy sector solutions by improving (i) the energy systems \nplanning process (by developing holistic plans in a participatory and inclusive manner); (ii) the \n \n10 ADB. 2016.

(TA-9266-REG).  \n \n ", "4   \n \nquality of energy sector service delivery (through efficient and climate change resilient project \ndesign and management to expand infrastructure and introduce good operation and maintenance \npractices); (iii) institutional effectiveness in line ministries and utilities (by ensuring sustainability \nthrough good governance and improved credit worthiness); and (iv) the enabling environment for \nenergy sector services (by improving the policy, legal, and regulatory setting). \n15.  The TA facility will combine activities that will help develop the portfolio of the South Asia \nEnergy Division (SAEN) during 2020\u20132022, and thereby help catalyze and mobilize resources \nneeded for development; strengthen ADB\u2019s knowledge services and support to Bangladesh; and \nimprove ADB\u2019s response to client needs with respect to project design, administration, and \nknowledge management. \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n16.  Initially, the TA facility will support preparation and implementation of three ensuing \nprojects: (i) Scaling Up Energy Efficiency and Conservation Project; (ii) Sustainable and Reliable \nPower Supply Project; and (iii) Green Power Development Investment Project. The TA facility will \nbe further expanded to support preparation of other projects within the overall scope of this TA \nfacility. \n17.  Output 1: Improved planning, project design, and readiness. The TA facility will be \nprovided for planning and design of ensuing projects to ensure they are procurement ready. \nHolistic, inclusive, climate-resilient, and participatory planning approaches will be considered \nwhere appropriate in prioritizing project and/or programs for ADB financing. Detailed activities will \ninclude, when required: (i) feasibility studies and/or preliminary engineering designs for the \nensuing investment;11 (ii) economic analysis; (iii) financial management assessment, financial \nevaluation and financial analysis; (iv) strategic procurement planning including procurement risk \nassessment; (v) gender analysis, collection of sex-disaggregated baseline data, and gender \naction plans; (vi) risk assessment and management plans; (vii) safeguards documents addressing \nrisks  and  impacts  on  the  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples;             \n(viii) climate risks and vulnerability assessments; (ix) sector assessments; and (x) information, \ncommunication, and technology systems. The TA facility will also explore options to apply \nadvanced  or  high-level  technology  in  project  design  by  adapting  such  technology  to  local \nconditions, with awareness of the local contracting market. \n18.  Output 2: Improved institutional capacity in project administration and energy \nsector service delivery. As part of policy and regulatory support, this output will identify and \nassess potential reforms for (i) improving the effectiveness and efficiency of ministerial oversight \nof state-owned enterprises; and (ii) improving the uptake of energy-efficient technologies. To \nimprove credit worthiness, analyses of the fiscal efficiency and sustainability of public utilities will \nbe carried out to identify possible operational reforms that could be incorporated into future \nprograms or projects. Counterpart staff capacity building will include (i) peer-to-peer arrangements \nfor energy sector service delivery; (ii) project administration oversight; and (iii) support in establishing \ndesign standards, policy, and regulatory frameworks. Assistance will be provided in specific fields \nof expertise, including (i) technical expertise in advanced technology in core energy sector \nservices (reliable power and gas supply; digitalization of energy systems; energy efficiency and \naudit; safety management, and energy systems planning and development); (ii) procurement and \n \n11 The TA will not provide financing for detailed engineering designs of ensuing projects.  \n \n ", "5 \n \ncontract management (resolving bid evaluation and contractual disputes); and (iii) social and \nenvironmental safeguard monitoring (resolving noncompliance issues).   \n19.  Output 3: Improved knowledge management and sharing among sub-sectors. The \nTA facility will support knowledge management and sharing through the organization of training, \nworkshops, and conferences at the country level, enhancing knowledge and lesson sharing \namong concerned line ministry, sector utilities and regulators. The TA facility will also support, \nwhen required, the development of knowledge solutions linked to the ensuing projects and will \nwork in close collaboration with ADB\u2019s energy sector group to collect and disseminate appropriate \nlessons. To the extent possible, the TA facility will also support peer-to-peer learning through \ntwinning arrangements between organizations in Bangladesh involved in the ensuing projects and \ntheir  counterparts  in  developed countries.  All  these  activities  are  directly  linked to  smooth \nprocessing of ensuing projects and their implementation through knowledge sharing among the \nprojects and the stakeholders.  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n20.  The TA facility is estimated to cost $1,025,000, of which $1,000,000 will be financed on a \ngrant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-6). The key expenditure items \nare listed in Appendix 1. \n21.  The TA facility scope is expected to be expanded to cover other additional activities, \nconsistent with the TA facility\u2019s outputs, and the facility will be replenished from time to time as \nfunds are required and identified. The government will provide counterpart support in the form of \ndata acquisition, counterpart staff, and other in-kind contributions. The government was informed \nthat approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n22.  ADB will administer the TA facility and will be responsible for the selection, supervision \nand evaluation of consultants.  \n23.  Output 1 activities for the ensuing projects will commence only after ADB approves the \nrespective  project  concept  papers.  Output  2  activities  to  assist  Bangladesh  in  project \nmanagement and Output 3 activities involving knowledge management and sharing shall also \ncommence once ADB approves the project concept papers of the respective ensuing projects. \nThe TA facility will be implemented over 44 months and is expected to commence in May 2020. \n24.  The TA facility will recruit a team of individual consultants to assist in achieving the outputs. \nSelected, core individual consultants will be based at ADB headquarters to ensure integration of \nconsultant activities into SAEN\u2019s workplan. Offices at project locations will be established when \nrequired, either at Bangladesh counterpart premises, ADB\u2019s Bangladesh resident mission, or \nrental offices, depending on location and availability. \n25.

Multidisciplinary team of individual consultants will be recruited to carry out activities \nidentified under the TA facility and approximately 43 person-months of international consultants\u2019 \ninput and 30 person-months of national consultants\u2019 input will be required. The expertise of the \nconsultants will cover the entire range required to conduct necessary due diligence for the ensuing \nprojects. The recruitment will follow ADB\u2019s individual consultant selection process and will use \ntime-based and/or output-based partial lump-sum contracts. Consultants will be deployed based \non the requirements of each ensuing project (footnote1). Individual consultant selection rather \nthan firm selection is considered appropriate, because the TA facility involves multiple activities \nthat are not necessarily interdependent and will require a varied range of consultants\u2019 expertise \nand services. Since the 2021 and 2022 investment projects have not yet been fully conceptualized, \nthe engagement of individual consultants offers the necessary flexibility in preparing those \nprojects. To prepare a series of investment projects as planned to be supported by this TA facility, \nimportant synergies may be reaped from engaging the same consultants for a standard set of due \ndiligence. \nE.  Governance  \n \n28.  ADB will administer the TA facility, and thus the financial management, procurement, and \nintegrity risks during implementation are assessed to be low. However, the TA facility will conduct \nthorough risk assessments of governance subjects for ensuing investment projects. \n \n \n12 Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n \n ", "7 \n \nII.
