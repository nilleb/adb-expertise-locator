INTRODUCTION\n1. In 1997, the Government requested the Bank's assistance to improve the water\nsupply and sewerage systems in the Suva\u2014Nauson area of Fiji's principal island of Viti Levu.\nThe Bank's country program for Fiji includes a loan Project for this purpose in 2000. The\nproposed Project is part of a Government program to upgrade water supply and sewerage\nservices in Fiji's main population centers. Bank-financed technical assistance (TA) to prepare a\nframework for corporatizing water supply and sewerage services in Fiji has recently been\ncompleted.1\n2. The Government reaffirmed its request for assistance to the Bank's 1998 Country\nProgramming mission. The Government is concurrently seeking further assistance from the\nBank to implement its program to corporatize public enterprises. Further TA for implementing\nthe recommended corporatization measures is programmed for 1999, and will be implemented\nin step with the proposed Project. A Fact-finding Mission for the project preparatory TA for the\nproposed Suva\u2014Nausori Water Supply and Sewerage Project visited Fiji from 27 May to 5 June\n1998.2\nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n3. Suva is the capital of Fiji. The Suva urban area, which includes Suva city and the\nnearby towns of Nausori and Lami, is located in the east of Fiji's principal island of Viti Levu. It\nhas a population of 250,000 people, it is Fiji's principal commercial and service center, and it is\nthe center of Government. Retail banks, insurance companies, and distributors of supplies and\nmaterials have their principal offices and depots in the Suva urban area Suva is also one of Fiji's\nmajor ports, which has stimulated the growth of associated industries and commercial ventures.\nExport-oriented industries include clothing manufacture, footwear manufacture, and food\nprocessing. Other small industries are associated with distribution and local consumption.\n4. The Suva urban area is served by a common water supply system, but Suva and\nNausori have independent sewerage systems. In 1998 Suva suffered from water supply\ndisruptions, which were overcome by adjusting and optimizing existing supply facilities.\nMeasures to reduce water losses from system leaks are being implemented. However, the\nwater supply system has very little reserve capacity. Only about 60,000 of Suva's 160,000\npopulation are connected to the piped sewerage system. The remainder of the city's population\nis served by on-site disposal systems - septic tanks, household cesspits, and the like - and\nlevels of pollution in the streams and drains that flow through the city indicate that the discharge\nof untreated sewage is increasingly becoming an environmental and health hazard.\n5. Since 1993, the Government has focused its economic policies on export-led\ngrowth, but has recognized that inadequate infrastructure will be a major constraint. A program\nto improve water supply and sewerage services in the main centers of economic activity has\ncommenced. The two most significant centers, are the Suva urban area and the Nadi-Lautoka\narea of Viti Levu.\n6. The population of the Suva urban area grew at a rate of 4.7 percent per annum\nduring the intercensus decade between 1976 and 1986. Final census data for 1996 are being\nTA No. 2621-FIJ: Corporatization of the Water and Sewerage Section of the Ministry of Public Works,\nInfrastructure, and Transport, for $800,000 approved on 30 July 1996.\nThe TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in April 1 96.\n- -\n-\n-\n.\t -\t -\t -\n-\t -\t --- -\t -\nh1\t\nI-.- I\t *, I\t \u2022.

The population growth rate now appears to have\nincreased again, and may continue at around 3 percent per annum until 2000. The increased\nrate of population growth will place further strain on Suva's water supply and sanitation systems.\nAs well as constraining economic growth, lack of capacity in these systems will have a\ndeleterious impact on community health and the city's environment.\n7. Urban water supply and sewerage services in Fiji are developed and operated by\nthe Water and Sewerage Section (WSS) of the Public Works Department. 1 As a component of\nits economic reforms, the Government has embarked on a program of corporatizing and, where\nappropriate, privatizing the delivery of urban services. The Bank has been assisting the\nGovernment in the c\u00f4rporatization of WSS, and has programmed further assistance in the\nimplementation of corporatization.2\n8. In the Suva urban area, development of water supply services has continued in\nline proposals made in the late 1970s, and set out in greater detail in a master plan prepared in\n1984. The city's sewerage master plan was prepared in 1971, and development of the\nsewerage system has largely followed the concepts set out in the original master plan.\n9. The capacities of Suva's two principal sources of water supply are nearing their\nlimits. An assessment of demand is required, and water treatment and transmission systems\nneed to be optimized to better match sources to centers of demand. Priority has been given to\nthe connection of old sewers in Suva's central business area, and to new low-cost housing\nareas. A rational plan for the development of the sewerage system is required. A master plan for\nthe development of the city's principal sewage treatment plant at Kinoya was completed in\n1997. As a first step, WSS is refurbishing the plant, and will shortly commence a project that will\nincrease its capacity and remove nutrients that would otherwise cause enrichment of the nearby\ncoastal waters.\n10. The Government is receiving assistance from Japan to upgrade the Nadi-\nLautoka water supply system.3 Assistance from the European Union is programmed for an\nenvironmental project that will provide a new solid waste disposal landfill for Suva, and will\nextend the outfall pipeline from the Kinoya sewage treatment plant to discharge treated sewage\n1.5 kilometers offshore.\n11. A new master plan for the development of water supply and sewerage services in\nthe Suva urban area will be developed under the TA. The master plan will identify short-term\nand long-term development requirements, and identify optimal investment packages. From the\ndevelopment of the master plan, the TA will prepare a feasibility study for a Project that will\nsignificantly contribute to fulfilling the medium-term needs for water supply and sewerage\ndevelopment in the Suva urban area.\n12. The TA will complement programmed Bank assistance for public enterprise\nreform. The master plan and investment project identified by the TA will prepare the physical\ncomponents of Suva's water supply and sewerage systems for commercialized operation, and\nwill ensure that their development is matched to consumer needs.\nPWD is a department of the Ministry of Communications, Works, and Energy.\nThe Government has declared WSS to be a reorganization entity, and with programmed Bank TA for pubLic\nenterprise reform WSS will become an autonomous Government -owned company.\nA soft loan from the Overseas Economic cooperation Fund for US$17 million was approved in February\n1998.\n,.,I I J JI I\t I IjJI\t I\t e\t Ii\t i !..JLI)\n_I \u2022 W I\t V I\t I \u2022 I II IPIIt Y I1 II IIIL1I 11d I\na .....a \n- -----------n._..

The objective of the TA is to assist with economic and human development in\nFiji through the development of water supply and sewerage services in the Suva urban area.\nUnder Phase I of the TA, a master plan will be prepared to guide the development of water\nsupply and sewerage services for the next 20 years. An investment Project suitable for Bank\nfinancing will be prepared under Phase 2 of the TA. The TA framework is in Appendix 1.\nB.\t Scope\nMaster Plan\n14. Under Phase 1 of the TA, current master plans for the development of water\nsupply and sewerage services in the Suva urban area, which includes the city of Suva together\nwith the towns of Nausori and Lami and nearby rural areas, will be reviewed. Service levels will\nbe reviewed, public expectations will be evaluated, and willingness to pay for water services will\nbe assessed in conjunction with a review of the fiscal and household affordability. Appropriate\nservice levels will be determined. Projections of the geographical spread of the population,\ntogether with commercial and industrial growth, will be made for a 20-year time frame.\n15. The extent of the water supply and sewerage systems will be reviewed, demand\nin the localities covered by the systems will be projected, and recommendations will be made on\nthe future extent of the system. Demand projections will be based on projections of\ndevelopment, with allowance being made for suppressed demand, the likely impact of the\nintroduction of rationally based tariffs, and practicable targets for the reduction of nonrevenue\nwater. The capacities of existing facilities will be assessed and alternatives for the development\nof services will be evaluated. Recommendations for future developments will be based on least-\ncost options. Particular attention will be paid to the need for and timing of the development of\nnew sources of water supply.\n16. At the conclusion of Phase 1 of the TA, a master plan for the development of\nmain water supply and sewerage services in the Suva urban area will be prepared, which will\nset out a staged development program and will indicate the costs of each component of the\ndevelopment program. The master plan will be discussed, and its components agreed to by the\nGovernment, Bank, and consultants.\n2.\t Feasibility Study\n17. A priority investment Project will be identified from the master plan prepared\nunder Phase 1 of the TA. A feasibility study for the proposed Project will be carried out. The\nobjectives and scope of the proposed Project will be fully defined, and effective demand for\nProject outputs will be assessed. A detailed Project framework, setting out the objectives,\ntargets, inputs, outputs, measurable indicators, assumptions, and risks associated with the\nProject will be prepared, and benchmarks for measuring the impact of the Project will be\ndetermined. Technical alternatives for meeting the objectives ofthe Project will be identified and\nProject components will be determined from the results of a least-cost analyses of the\nalternatives.\n. .I.I;\t\n.........-.-i.  ,...-e..i......-..T\t \t -.- .................-.-.-.-.-..-.-.-------\n- --------\t ---\t-------- I_-i- 1-I1-I-.4-I-,,-I1-,-II)-(.I I\tIII(JI- I\t\t -.\t I I It\t 1UJVI ill III  IL I\t L.1J1 ItIJIUI LIV\t .trI'L..l  1_L.II. .L I- I I\t....-. -- - - -.I I- LII It LII\n--\nLL.I Ll\t LJclIir\\\t IJJ LIL1LIIILI\t\n. .\t .\t LAJI I ILIiLLl.\t - -\na, ILl\t a.j\t .LlI V i'..,I\t 1 I\t III\t i'..t.I I\t 'I V '.\"' '\t II\t I IVVIJI I'.

The social and environmental implications of the proposed Project will be\nassessed from the viewpoints both of short-term impacts during Project implementation and\nlonger term impacts after the conclusion of implementation, in accordance with the Bank's\ncurrent guidelines. Local environmental impact assessment procedures will be followed, and\nany necessary mitigation measures will be determined. Economic and financial analyses will\nalso be carried out in accordance with the Bank's current guidelines. Quantifiable and\nnonquantifiable Project benefits will be determined, and risk analyses and economic and\nfinancial benefit-cost analyses will be carried out. An outline design of the Project components\nwill be prepared, and will incorporate the findings of the economic, social, and environmental\nanalyses. Topographical surveys will be carried out where necessary to verify the location of\nfacilities.\n19. Packages for the procurement of materials and equipment, and for execution of\nengineering works, will be recommended. Project cost estimates will be prepared, detailing\ndirect and indirect foreign exchange costs and local currency costs. Outline terms of reference\nfor consulting services will be prepared, and a full report on the findings of the feasibility study\nwill be presented for the consideration of the Government and the Bank.\nC.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n20. The total cost of the TA is estimated as US$852,000 equivalent, of which\nUS$693,000 is the foreign exchange cost and US$159,000 equivalent is the local currency cost.\nThe Bank will finance the entire foreign exchange cost and US$107,000 of the local currency\ncost. The TA is proposed initially as a grant from the Bank-funded TA program. The technical\nassistance is currently under consideration for possible funding from JSF. If such funding is\napproved by the Government of Japan, the Bank will shift the sources of funding from the Bank-\nfunded TA program to Japan Special Fund (JSF).  The Government will meet the balance of\n1\nlocal currency costs, equivalent to US$52,000 in kind, for counterpart staff, office\naccommodation, and local communications. The Government has been informed that approval\nof the TA does not commit the Bank to finance any ensuing project.  Cost estimates of the TA\n2\nare given in Appendix 2.\nD.\t Implementation Arrangements\n21. The Executing Agency for the TA will be the Ministry of Communications, Works\nand Energy (MCWE), which will establish a steering committee to guide the TA. The overall\nimplementation period will be eight months.  Phase 1 will be completed in a three-month period,\n3\nand will be followed by a review period of one month, during which a draft master plan will be\ndiscussed by the Government, Bank, and TA consultants. The master plan will be finalized from\ndiscussions at the conclusion of Phase 1. Phase 2, which will focus on the feasibility study, will\nbe completed in a further period of four months.\n22. For Phase 1, a total of nine person-months of international consulting services\nand four person-months of domestic consulting services will be required. The consulting\nservices will be carried out by a firm of international consultants, in association with a firm of\ndomestic consultants. International consultants will comprise a water supply and sewerage\nShould JSF funding be confirmed, the cost recovery provisions set out in the President's Decision will not\napply.\nThe TA may lead to an investment Project of about $26 million.\nIt is expected that consultants will be fielded in November 1998.\n1'o VnIIe I.
