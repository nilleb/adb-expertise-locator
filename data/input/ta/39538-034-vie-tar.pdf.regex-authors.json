INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Viet Nam has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nprovide technical assistance (TA)1 to support implementation of the State-Owned Enterprise \nReform and Corporate Governance Facilitation Program.2 The ADB strategy toward the state-\nowned  enterprise  (SOE)  sector  in  Viet  Nam  has  two  defining characteristics:  (i)  long-term \nsupport, and (ii) responsiveness. ADB has been engaged with SOE reform since the late 1990s. \nADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program,  2007\u201320103 as  well  as  the  proposed  new  country \npartnership strategy, 2012\u20132015 underline SOE reform as central to its strategy for business \ndevelopment and private-sector-led employment growth. The ADB country assistance program \nevaluation4 carried out in 2009 also recommends support for SOE reform. A fact-finding mission \nwas  fielded  on  26\u201330  September  2011  and  reached  an  understanding  with  government \ncounterparts on the objective, scope, cost, and implementation arrangements for the TA. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  To date, efforts at SOE reform in Viet Nam have largely focused on equitization (the \nprocess of converting SOEs into joint stock companies with limited liability) and divestment of \nsmall and medium-sized SOEs. While this has resulted in a marked reduction in the number of \nSOEs,  remaining  SOEs\u2014many  of  them  large  in  size,  complex  in  operation,  and  weak  in \nperformance\u2014continue to account for some 40% of assets in the enterprise sector.5 Reform \nand restructuring of large SOEs will be crucial to reducing the deadweight of inefficient state \nproduction,  promoting  private  sector  development,  and  supporting  economic  growth.  Such \nreforms, however, will be inherently complex in both design and implementation, involving a \ndisparate range of stakeholders and interests. \n \n3.  The government clearly recognizes the necessity as well as the complexity of these \nreforms and has undertaken a step-by-step approach in partnership with ADB through the \nimplementation of a multitranche financing facility (MFF) in support of SOE reform (footnote 2). \nThe MFF supports the corporate, operational, and financial restructuring of selected individual \nSOEs on a pilot basis\u2014with a view to supporting the development of a generalizable approach \nto reform and restructuring of large SOEs. \n \n4.  The MFF became effective in 2011 and has a projected implementation period of about \n5 years. The overall MFF amount is for $630 million ($600 million ordinary capital resources; \n$30 million Asian Development Fund), with the first tranche (periodic financing request [PFR 1]) \namounting  to  $130  million  ($120  million  ordinary  capital  resources;  $10  million  Asian \nDevelopment Fund) currently under implementation. Earlier project preparatory TA approved in \n2006 supported the preparation of the overall MFF design as well as PFR 1.6 It closed in 2009 \nfollowing  completion  of  these  objectives.  Additional  resources  will  be  needed  to  support \nimplementation of the MFF (including the design and preparation of remaining tranches) and \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 28 October 2011. \n2  ADB. 2009.

Manila. \n ", "2   \ndevelopment of a generalizable approach to SOE reform that builds on lessons and experience \ngained from the pilot restructurings. \n \n5.  PFR 1 supports the pilot testing of a systematic approach to SOE reform involving the \ncorporate, financial, and operational restructuring of two selected SOEs.7 Before moving into \nPFR 2, it will be important to closely monitor progress on the ground of the two participating \nSOEs under PFR 1, and provide support for ongoing stakeholder consultation and consensus \nbuilding with respect to reforms. Ongoing monitoring and assessment of the pilot reforms will \nalso allow for refinements to be made to the approach adopted under PFR 1 for subsequent \ntranches. The Ministry of Finance (MOF), the executing agency, has been assigned by the \ngovernment to take the lead in the development and implementation of an SOE restructuring \nprogram, which takes into account and builds on lessons and experience gained from the \nimplementation of the pilot restructurings under the MFF. This TA aims to provide support to the \nMOF and other implementing agencies in this regard through support for the updating of the \ninstitutional and policy framework to allow for an effective generalizable approach to SOE \nrestructuring and reform, drawing on lessons from the implementation of the pilot restructurings \nunder the MFF. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The impact of the TA will be improved efficiency and accountability of the SOE sector. \nTo this end, it will support, as its outcome, the adoption of an updated institutional and policy \nframework for SOE reform, based on lessons from implementation of pilot restructurings under \nthe MFF. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n7.  Development of a generalizable approach to SOE reform will involve close monitoring \nand ongoing assessment of the pilot restructuring efforts under PFR 1 of the MFF, with a view to \nsupporting ongoing stakeholder consultation and consensus building on the approach adopted. \nTo this end, the TA will provide support through (i) establishment of a monitoring system for \nassessing progress on SOE reform and restructuring; (ii) development of an updated approach \nto SOE restructuring building on lessons learned from implementation of the program; and (iii) \ndevelopment of knowledge products and related capacity to update the institutional and policy \nframework for SOE reform. The TA will also help to support the government in the identification \nand preparation of SOE candidates for subsequent restructurings. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n8.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,200,000 equivalent. The government has requested ADB \nto finance $1,200,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). The government will provide counterpart support in the \nform of counterpart staff, office space and utilities, and other in-kind contributions. The cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \n                                                \n7  Debt restructuring has been undertaken and contracts for the main corporate restructuring packages for the two \nSOEs have been awarded with implementation expected to commence in early 2012. \n ", "  3 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n9.  The MOF will be the executing agency for the TA. Implementing agencies include the \nMinistry of Planning and Investment and SOEs undergoing restructuring. Coordination will make \nuse of existing project management units and arrangements established under the MFF. Inputs \nprovided by participating government agencies and SOEs will include provision of necessary \ncounterpart staff time, facilities, documents, and data. \n \n10.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months from February 2012 to January 2014. The \nmajority of activities under the TA will be carried out by an international consulting firm with \nstrong experience in SOE reform. Activities under the TA will be divided into two components: \none focused on monitoring and evaluation of pilot restructuring and supporting strengthening of \nthe policy and institutional framework for SOE reform, and the other focused on supporting MFF \nimplementation.  The  international  consultants  supporting  activities  related  to  monitoring, \nevaluation, and strengthening of the institutional and policy framework will comprise (i) an SOE \nreform and corporate governance specialist (8 person-months), (ii) a corporate restructuring \nspecialist (3 person-months), and (iii) a legal and regulatory specialist (2 person-months). Two \nnational consultants will support the international experts: (i) an SOE reform and corporate \ngovernance  specialist  (5  person-months),  and  (ii)  a  legal  and  regulatory  specialist  who  is \nfamiliar with SOE reforms (1.5 person-months). International consultants supporting activities \nrelated  to  MFF  implementation  will  include  (i)  SOE  reforms  and  governance  specialist  (5 \nperson-months),  (ii)  corporate  restructuring  specialist  (3  person-months),  (iii)  financial \nrestructuring specialist (2 person-months), and (iv) a SOE legal and regulatory expert (1 person-\nmonth). The team will be supported by the required number of national consultants (5 person-\nmonths), including a project coordinator. Interpreters will be engaged to facilitate the workshops. \nThe  consulting  firm  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time) using the quality- and cost-based selection \nmethod based on submission of simplified technical proposals. \n \n11.  This will be complemented by a small team of national individual consultants to provide \nsupport to the project monitoring unit within the MOF. The team will consist of one national \nconsultant (minimum 15 person-months) familiar with the Viet Nam SOE sector as well as an \ninterpreter (24 person-months) to help in translation and related work. A number of workshops \nwill be held intermittently to strengthen the capacity of the line ministries, the MOF, and the \nMinistry of Planning and Investment; and to discuss, comment, and obtain stakeholder feedback \non the evolving framework for SOE reform. Workshops will engage national and international \nresource persons as needed. Consultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants. TA disbursements will be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). All procurement will \nbe done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). \n \n12.  TA  implementation  will  be  closely  monitored  and  evaluated  through  (i)  ongoing \nconsultations with stakeholders, (ii) regular review missions, and (iii) periodic progress reports. \nThe  TA  will  support  timely  distillation  and  dissemination  of  recommendations  and  lessons \nthrough (print as well as web-based) publication of working papers and support for stakeholder \nworkshops and conferences). \n \n ", "4   \nIV.
