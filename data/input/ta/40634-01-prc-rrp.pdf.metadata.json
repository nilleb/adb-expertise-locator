I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  People's  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  for  the  Inner  Mongolia  Autonomous  Region \nEnvironment Improvement Project (Phase II). \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n2.  The PRC depends heavily on coal, which made up 68.7% of the primary energy supply \nin 2008. This has brought substantial environmental damage caused by harmful emissions such \nas sulfur dioxide (SO ), nitrogen oxides (NO ), and total suspended particulates (TSP). SO  and \n2 x 2\nNO  are the main causes of acid rain, a pressing environmental problem in the PRC, and TSP \nx\ncauses serious respiratory diseases. Carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, is a major \nemission from coal burning and a cause of global warming. Air pollution is estimated to cost the \nPRC  economy  3.8%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  annually. 1  The  Inner  Mongolia \nAutonomous Region (IMAR) depended on coal to meet more than 90% of its energy demand in \n2008. Reliance on coal has a high environmental cost for urban areas in IMAR, as only 6 out of \n15 cities monitored for air quality reach class II air quality standards.2 IMAR has proven coal \nreserves of more than 47 billion tons, or about 25% of the total coal reserves in the PRC, but it \nhas less than 2% of the PRC's population.3 IMAR generates electricity for export to other \nprovinces and major load centers like Beijing. This causes disproportionately high SO  and \n2\nother coal emissions in IMAR. In 2008, its SO emissions were 1.43 million tons, which is 5% of \n2 \nnational emissions. Coal burning for district heating contributes 10% of IMAR SO  emissions. \n2\nThe Government of the PRC targets in its Eleventh Five-Year Plan, 2006\u20132010 a 10% reduction \nin SO  emissions and a 20% reduction in energy intensity4 by 2010 compared with 2005. The \n2\nIMAR  economy  is  relatively  inefficient,  using  2.61  tons  of  standard  coal  equivalent  per \nCNY10,000 of GDP, or double the national average of 1.10 tons in 2008. The IMAR target is to \nimprove energy intensity by 25% by 2010. \n \n3.  District heating in IMAR depends primarily on coal, which provides 95% of heating \nrequirements. Moreover, most of the existing district heating infrastructure is old and inefficient. \nThe IMAR government recognizes the importance of improving energy efficiency in district \nheating  as a  priority  toward  achieving  IMAR's  target  for  improving  energy  intensity.  Large \nenergy efficiency gains are attainable from the district heating subsector through replacing and \nupgrading heat generators and improving insulation on distribution systems. Small heating \nboilers  typically  have  efficiencies  of  40%\u201350%,  while  new,  larger  boilers  have  efficiencies \nexceeding  80%.  Additional  opportunities  for  improving  energy  efficiency  and  reducing  the \nenvironmental impact of district heating are offered by alternative renewable or recycled energy, \nsuch as geothermal energy and using waste heat from industrial processes.  \n \n4.  Due to its remoteness and low population density, IMAR includes some of the poorest \nareas in the PRC. The population of IMAR was 24.14 million in 2008, which is 1.82% of the \nnational total, though IMAR occupies 12.3% of the land area. IMAR has 31 national poverty \ncounties and 29 provincial poverty counties with 800,665 people living below the poverty line. \n                                                 \n1\n World Bank and State Environmental Protection Administration. 2007.

", "2   \nThe  provision  of  reliable,  affordable  household  heating  is  a  basic  necessity  in  IMAR  as \ntemperatures can fall to \u201340\u00b0C and the heating season can last for 7 months. Environmental \nimpacts  from  current  heating  methods  have  a  disproportionately  high  impact  on  the  poor. \nInadequate coverage of district heating in low-income urban areas drives residents to use \nindoor coal stoves for heating, which is a major cause of respiratory disease. Urban pollution \nfrom small, local boilers also worsens outdoor air pollution and causes significant cumulative \nharm to public health. The cost of heating for the poor is relatively high. A typical family living on \nthe poverty line in a remote area of IMAR can expect to pay 20%\u201330% of its annual income on \nheating. Poor-quality district heating has a disproportionate impact on women as women take \nmore responsibility for collecting fuel and operating household heating systems and spend more \ntime at home exposed to high indoor pollution.  \n \n5.  Demand  for  district  heating  is  growing  rapidly  with  strong  economic  growth,  higher \nincomes, and the privatization of housing, which has increased sharply in recent years. Single-\nstory residences that are expensive to supply with district heating are rapidly being replaced \nwith high-rise residential buildings that are more suitable for district heating. Relocation policies \nfor rural herders, intended to reduce environmental pressure on fragile pastures, are causing \nurbanization and increased demand for district heating. The urban share of IMAR\u2019s population \nincreased from 42.2% in 2000 to 51.7% in 2008.5 As a consequence, the district heating area \nhas expanded rapidly, increasing by more than 50% during 2006\u20132008. This rapid increase has \nresulted in demand\u2013supply imbalance.  \n \n6.  Municipal  and  county  governments  are  responsible  for  urban  planning,  establishing \nheating tariffs, providing financial support to the urban poor to pay heating bills, encouraging \nprivate sector participation in the heating sector, and establishing supply contracts with district \nheating companies. Heating reforms are works in progress with significant adjustments in tariffs \nthat are now based on cost recovery plus a margin, and mechanisms are in place to allow tariff \nadjustments based on increases in operating costs. However, private sector engagement in \nIMAR\u2019s heating sector has been relatively slow because (i) financial returns are low; (ii) initial \ninfrastructure costs are high; (iii) perceived high risks make local financial institutions reluctant \nto provide financing, particularly in remote urban areas with small markets; and (iv) the number \nof private companies with the required technical and managerial capacity to operate such \nutilities is small. The district heating sector is not yet mature enough to survive the withdrawal of \nsupport from the public sector that is required for capacity building and easier access to capital.  \n \n7.  Existing district heating infrastructure consists largely of inefficient neighborhood coal-\nfired boilers with low capacity and efficiency and an aging and poorly insulated pipe network that \nsuffers high distribution losses. The existing coal-fired boilers are highly polluting and lack \nemission-control devices. In many urban areas, district heating systems were installed in the \n1970s and have exceeded their design lives, resulting in unreliable service. The inadequacy of \nheating in remote areas disproportionately affects the poor.  \n \n8.  IMAR is a major producer of natural gas, which is widely considered to be the cleanest \nfossil fuel.6 But the consumption of natural gas as a proportion of total energy consumption is \nless  than  2.5%,  lower  than  the  national  average.  This  is  primarily  because  natural  gas \ntransmission  and  distribution  infrastructure  is  underdeveloped.  Analysis  of  natural  gas \nconsumption  patterns  in  IMAR  shows  that  natural  gas  is  used  mainly  in  industry,  while \nhousehold use accounts for only 16.1% of the total. The project will extend the natural gas \n                                                 \n5  National Bureau of Statistics of China. 2009.

The project will upgrade infrastructure for district heating that will make it more energy \nefficient and allow increased heat supply for expanding areas. Assistance will construct more \nefficient  boilers,  as  well  as  transmission  and  distribution  pipelines.  The  government  has \nclassified natural gas for residential use as a priority area for development. Keyouqian Banner \nhas incorporated the supply of natural gas into the design of newly urbanized areas. The project \nwill  enable  the  provision  of  clean  energy  to  the  city  and  boost  economic  development  in \nKeyouqian, which is one of the poorest banners in IMAR.7  \n \n10.  The project will avoid coal consumption by 1.04 million tons annually, thereby reducing \nannual emissions of 14,070 tons of SO , 15,420 tons of TSP, 6,500 tons of NO , and 1.59 \n2 x\nmillion  tons  of  carbon  dioxide  (CO ).  Combined,  the  Inner  Mongolia  Autonomous  Region \n2\nEnvironment Improvement Project8 and the proposed project will construct or rehabilitate a \ndistrict heating area of 71.49 million square meters (m2) in IMAR, which is 38.7% of the total \ndistrict heating area of 184.5 million m2 in 2008.9 Together, these projects will improve energy \nefficiency in the district heating sector of IMAR by more than 15%, thereby annually avoiding \n1.75 million tons of coal consumption and annual emissions of 31,640 tons of SO , 36,967 tons \n2\nof TSP, 9,218 tons of NO ,and 2.66 million tons of CO .10 \nx  2\n \n11.  The  project  is  consistent  with  the  PRC  country  partnership  strategy,  2008\u2013201011 \nstrategic pillar of resource efficiency and environmental sustainability and the Energy Policy12 \npriority of energy efficiency and environmental protection. It supports the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) energy efficiency initiative to expand ADB\u2019s investments in clean energy projects. \nThe project will build on continuing engagement with the Government of IMAR (GIMAR) in the \nenergy sector. In 2006, ADB approved the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Environment \nImprovement Project for $120 million (footnote 8), which targeted district heating and natural \ngas  distribution  in  the  Wuhai  and  Bayannur  municipalities  of  IMAR.  In  June  2010,  ADB \napproved  a  major  change  in  project  scope  for  the  expansion  of  Linhe  district  heating \nsubcomponent, utilizing $48.96 million in unused balance of Loan 2260.13 The project will help \nGIMAR  provide  improved  and  diversified  district  heating  to  a  significant  proportion  of  the \nremaining municipalities in IMAR, including remoter and poorer areas.  \n \n12.  Some start-up delay was experienced in implementing the Inner Mongolia Autonomous \nRegion Environment Improvement Project due to (i) slow mobilization of domestic loan funds, \n(ii) county governments\u2019 poor understanding of requirements for counter guarantees, and (iii) \ndeferment  of  detailed  project  design  until  the  loan  agreement  is  signed.  The  project  has \naddressed these issues by (i) rigorously reviewing the key factors in project readiness that may \n                                                 \n7  A banner is an administrative unit essentially equivalent to a county. \n8  ADB. 2006.

Manila \n(Loan 2260-PRC, approved on 29 September, $120 million). \n9  The IMAR heating area increased from 52.2 million m2 in 2000 to 184.5 million m2 in 2008 and was projected to \nincrease to 245 million m2 by 2010 and 492 million m2 by 2015. \n10 The detailed environmental benefit is in the Summary Sector Assessment (Appendix 2).  \n11 ADB. 2008.

Manila.  \n13 The major variation was necessary due to accelerated implementation of six district heating components ahead of \ntime without utilizing the ADB loan amount. Similarly, one of the wastewater treatment facilities became obsolete \nas the source of the wastewater was forced to shut down because it failed to meet environmental performance \nrequirements. The expanded Linhe district heating will enlarge coverage to additional 10 million m2 than what was \noriginally envisaged.  \n ", "4   \ndelay  start-up;  (ii)  ensuring  that  county  governments  are  fully  aware  of  counter-guarantee \nrequirements; (iii) providing training on ADB procurement and disbursement procedures; (iv) \ncommencing  detailed  project  design  even  while  the  loan  is  being  processed;  and \n(v) encouraging  utilization  of  advanced  contracting  and  retroactive  financing  features.  In \naddition, the project management office is getting involved early in the project design stage to \nensure better coordination between the design institutes and implementing agencies. To further \nensure smooth implementation, especially in the first year, separate capacity-building technical \nassistance (TA) for Energy Efficiency Improvements in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is \nprovided.14 This TA provides support in (i) capacity building and knowledge dissemination for \nimproved energy conservation in the district heating sector and (ii) institutional capacity building \nin project management.  \n \n13.  GIMAR  will  implement  key  heating  reforms  in  the  project  areas  by  requiring  the \nimplementing agencies to (i) install radiator control valves in apartments to encourage heat \nconservation, and (ii) use heat-measuring devices and consumption-based billing systems so \nthat charges will be based on actual heat consumption. These reforms will enable consumers to \nregulate the amount of heat they consume, which is essential if tariff-based incentives for heat \nconservation, insulation installation, and heat-loss reduction are to work. \n \n14.  Although the heating sector\u2019s high growth rate provides significant opportunity for private \nsector  participation,  a  number  of  barriers  exist  (para.  6).  Considering  the  importance  of \naffordable and reliable heating during winter, GIMAR plans initially to support interested private \ncompanies, thus allowing them to strengthen their technical, financial, and managerial capacity \nand  reach  economies  of  scale.  The  project  will  provide  financial  assistance  to  two  100% \nprivately owned district heating companies and two partly privatized companies to expand \noperations in remote urban areas, thereby contributing to economies of scale and improved \ncommercial performance.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n15.  The impact of the project will be improved energy efficiency in IMAR. The outcome of the \nproject will be improved air quality in six urban areas in IMAR.   \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n16.  The  project  will  have  two  outputs:  (i)  district  heating  supply  and  (ii)  natural  gas \ntransmission and distribution, as summarized below. \n \n17.  Output A: District heating supply. Output A will rehabilitate or construct infrastructure \nfor 34.49 million m2 of district heating area.15 It comprises six subprojects and will involve the \ninstallation of 21 efficient coal-fired boilers, 591 heat-exchange substations, 535 kilometers (km) \nof  heating  pipelines,  and  10  supervisory  control  and  data  acquisition  (SCADA)  systems, \nallowing the closure of 383 small, coal-fired boilers. Eighty percent of the heat will be from \ncombined  heat  and  power  plants,16 19%  from  coal-fired  boilers,  and  1%  from  waste  heat \nrecovery.  \n                                                 \n14 ADB. 2009.

The  government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $150  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 24-year term, including a grace \nperiod  of  4  years,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year \n(the interest and other charges during construction to be capitalized in the loan), and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. The government has \nprovided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility based on these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its \nown independent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n21.  The ADB loan will finance 45% of total project costs. The remaining $183.02 million \n(55%)  will  be  financed  by  implementing  agency  equity  (35.5%)  and  domestic  bank  loans \n(19.5%). Implementing agency equity includes internally generated funds from parent company \nor local government contributions. The ADB loan will be used for civil works, equipment and \nsupplies, consulting services, interest, and commitment charges during construction on the ADB \nloan, and including taxes and duties estimated to be $9.93 million on the ADB financed portion \nof the project costs. ADB's decision to finance the taxes and duties was based on the analysis \nthat the amount of taxes and duties does not constitute an excessive share of the project cost \nand it is material to the success of the project.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n24.  Financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  is  calculated  for  each  subproject.  Financial \nanalyses of the subprojects indicate FIRRs of between 7.0% and 9.2%, which for each case is \nhigher than the specific weighted average cost of capital. The FIRR for the whole project is \n7.6%, more than double the weighted average cost of capital of 3.6%. Sensitivity analysis \n ", "8   \nshows that the FIRR of the whole project would decrease to (i) 6.4% if there were a cost overrun \nof 10%; (ii) 4.5% if revenue decreased by 10%; (iii) 5.5% if major operating costs increased by \n10%; (iv) 7.4% if there were a 1-year delay in construction; and (v) 3.9% if (i), (iii), and (iv) were \nall to occur. The project is considered financially viable and sustainable. Sensitivity analysis \nshows that the project is likely to be sustainable under various adverse scenarios. \n \n25.  The  economic  benefits  of  district  heating  supply  include  improvements  in  heating \nefficiency and to the environment. The economic benefits of natural gas supply derive from \nimprovements to the environment. The calculations reflect all project-related costs, benefits from \ncost  savings  from  alternative  fuels  and  efficiency  improvements,  and  local  and  global \nenvironmental benefits. Analyses for each subproject indicate economic internal rates of return \n(EIRRs) ranging from 14.1% to 34.8%. The EIRR of the whole project is 27.6%, which is more \nthan double the 12% economic cost of capital. Therefore, the project is economically feasible. \nSensitivity analysis for each subproject indicated that a 10% benefit decrease would lower \nEIRRs for the subprojects to between 12.7% and 32.3%, still exceeding the economic cost of \ncapital. The analysis indicated that a 10% cost increase would reduce EIRRs for the subprojects \nto between 10.1% and 28.2%, with three subprojects having EIRRs marginally lower than the \neconomic cost of capital. This is considered acceptable and would not affect the project\u2019s \nviability.  Should  the  project  encounter  a  1-year  delay  in  commissioning,  the  EIRR  for  the \nsubprojects would fall to between 12.4% and 29.7%, which would not affect project viability. \n \nB.  Governance \n \n26.  Procurement  of  goods  and  works  shall  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  International  and  national \nconsultants financed under the loan will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time) using the quality- and cost-based \nselection method with simplified technical proposal (quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20).  \n \n27.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  GIMAR.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n28.  The project will improve public health by reducing urban air pollution with the closure of \nsmall, inner-city boilers, installation of more efficient heating boilers, reduced use of household \nstoves, and reduced coal truck traffic through urban areas. Improvements in air quality will \nindirectly benefit the entire urban population of about 2.28 million residing in the six subproject \nareas, and particularly the 78,100 poor residents, or 3.4% of the total. Access to reliable district \nheating and natural gas will improve the standard of living. By 2015, it is expected that 786,200 \nurban residents will benefit directly from improved district heating and natural gas supply as a \nresult of the project, and a further 680,500 urban residents will benefit from the improved \ninfrastructure. The increased use of natural gas and improved district heating will reduce the \nuse of such fuels as raw coal, wood, and coal briquettes for indoor heating and cooking, which \nwill benefit public health, particularly for the poor and women who spend most of their time \nindoors, as well as reduce the labor needed to acquire and burn fuel. The project will eliminate \n1,229 jobs with the closure of small boilers. The survey of affected workers indicated that 30% \nof them were former employees of the heating companies and the remainder were migrant \nworkers  with  contracts  for  a  single  heating  season.  A  labor-restructuring  plan  has  been \n ", "  9\nprepared to cover the affected workers.18 The implementing agencies have agreed to ensure \nthat all permanent employees affected by the closure of the small boilers under the project are \nreemployed in a timely manner and in accordance with the project labor-restructuring plan.  \n \nD.  Safeguards \n \n29.  The project has been classified as environmental category B, involuntary resettlement \ncategory B, and indigenous peoples category C. The project has substantial environmental \nbenefits resulting from energy efficiency improvements and reductions in emissions from coal \nburning. The project will (i) close small, inner-city coal-fired boilers; (ii) replace household coal-\nfired stoves; (iii) stop the transportation of coal through urban areas; (iv) substantially improve \nlocal air quality through reduced emissions of SO , TSP, and NO ; (v) provide a global public \n2 x\ngood by reducing emissions of CO ; and (vi) support the utilization of industrial waste heat. The \n2\npotential  adverse  environmental  impacts  from  the  project  include  (i)  soil  erosion  during \nconstruction,  (ii)  increased  noise  and  dust  affecting  local  residents  during  construction, \n(iii) inappropriate  storage  of  hazardous  materials  and  wastes  during  operation,  and \n(iv) increased gas emissions during operation. The summary initial environmental examination \nconcluded that the potential adverse environmental impacts can be adequately mitigated by \nfunding appropriate mitigation measures.19 \n \n30.  The project is classified as involuntary resettlement category B and indigenous peoples \ncategory C. One of the seven subprojects, Zhalaite District Heating Supply (DHS), will affect \npeople through land acquisition. The remaining subprojects have no resettlement, as they will \nbe implemented on government-reserved land or existing premises. For Zhalaite DHS, the \nexpansion  of  the  existing  facilities  will  require  (i)  1.1  hectares  of  government-owned  land \ncurrently used by two private entities, a driving school and a closed factory, and (ii) 1,740 m2 of \noffice and factory buildings of these entities. A short resettlement plan has been prepared for \nthe Zhalaite DHS subproject.20 \n \n31.  The resettlement objective is to achieve equal or better income and living standards in \nline with ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). Consultations with the two entities \naffected by Zhalaite DHS revealed that they prefer cash compensation for losing land-use rights \nand  structures.  The  estimated  cost  of  land  acquisition  and  leasing  is  CNY3.54  million  for \nZhalaite DHS, including compensation for land-use rights, nonresidential buildings, other assets, \nmoving allowances, administration and internal monitoring, and contingencies.  \n \nE.
