" \nI.  INTRODUCTION \n1.  During  the  2006  Country  Programming  Midterm  Review  Mission  for  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC), the Government confirmed its request for technical assistance (TA) to \nprepare the Central Yunnan Roads Development Project.1 The Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nFact-Finding Mission (i) visited the PRC in  February 2006; (ii)  traveled to the project  area; \n(iii) carried  out  an  initial  poverty  and  social  assessment  (IPSA)  and  rapid  environmental \nassessment  (REA),  and  held  consultation  meetings;  and  (iv)  discussed  economic,  social \ndevelopment, and project-specific issues with officials of the central and local governments. This \nreport is based on the agreement reached with the Government on the objectives, scope, costs, \nfinancing, terms of reference, and implementation arrangements for the TA, and the Mission's \nobservations in the field. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Since 1979, the PRC\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) has grown by 9.6% annually. Per \ncapita GDP increased from CNY379 in 1979 to CNY11,200 in 2005. More than two decades of \neconomic growth and industrial restructuring have substantially increased demand for road \ntransport to accommodate increased flows of goods, services, and people. From 1990 to 2004, \nthe volume of road passengers grew by 9% annually, reaching 877 billion passenger-kilometers \n(km) in 2004 and accounting for 54% of total passenger transport. During the same period, road \nfreight volume grew by 6% annually, reaching 760 ton-km and accounting for 11% of the total \nfreight  transport.  Road  transport  was  especially  preferred  by  medium-  and  short-distance \ntravelers as it carried 92% of total passengers and 74% of total freight in 2004. Despite rapid \neconomic growth, the coastal and western regions face large and rising disparities. In 2004, \nGDP per capita was CNY55,307 in Shanghai but only CNY6,733 (70% of the national average) \nin Yunnan Province. The long distance from major economic growth centers and inadequate \ntransport  infrastructure,  together  with  geographical  disadvantages,  have  impeded  the \ndevelopment of the western region.  \n \n3.  To facilitate the western region\u2019s economic development and mitigate regional disparities, \nthe  Government  launched  the  Western  Region  Development  Strategy  in  2000.  Yunnan,  a \nsouthwestern province with 44.5 million people and 394,000 square kilometers (km2), is among \nthe 12 western provinces targeted by the strategy. It is one of the least-developed provinces, \nwith the third-lowest GDP per capita among all provinces in 2004. Its average GDP growth rate \nin 2001\u20132005 was 8.9%, lower than the national average of about 10.0%. Poverty and the \nurban\u2013rural disparity are the major issues. Of the province\u2019s 128 counties, 73 are officially \ndesignated as poor. In 2005, the average annual disposable income was CNY9,250 for urban \nresidents but only CNY2,000 for rural residents. Per capita GDP in the most developed urban \ndistrict is almost 44 times that in the poorest rural county. Only 23% of the counties have a per \ncapita GDP reaching the provincial average, and less than 10% reach the national average. \n \n4.  Inadequate road infrastructure, particularly in rural areas, has been a major obstacle to \neconomic development and poverty reduction. The province\u2019s road network is among the least \ndeveloped in the PRC. By the end of 2004, expressways and high-standard highways (classes \n1 and 2) amounted to 1,291 km and 3,326 km, respectively, of the total 167,050 km of roads in \nthe province. In total, high-standard roads accounted for only 2.8%, which was much lower than \nthe national average of 12.0%, and more than 90.0% of the roads are class 4 or unclassified. \nRoad density is about 3.8 km per 1,000 inhabitants and 0.4 km per km2. Vehicle ownership grew \nby more than 15% annually in the past 10 years to 2.8 million in 2004, but road transport \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 8 February 2006. \n ", "2   \ndevelopment has lagged behind economic development: total freight transport volume in 2005 \nwas 65 billion ton-km, in which road transport accounted for 58% or 38 billion ton-km, but the \nannual growth rate of road freight volume was only 5.1% in 2001\u20132005, lower than the total \nfreight growth rate of 6.2% and much lower than the provincial GDP growth rate of 8.9%. \nSimilarly, total passenger transport volume in 2005 was 34 billion passenger-km, in which roads \naccounted for 71% or 24 billion, but the annual growth rate of road passenger volume in 2001\u2013\n2005 was 7.3%, also lower than the total passenger growth rate of 7.5% and the provincial GDP \ngrowth rate. \n \n5.  Studies and evaluations of several completed road projects financed by ADB2 and the \nWorld  Bank3 show  that  road  investments  reduce  poverty.  Road  development  that  is  well \nintegrated  with  local  roads  and  supports  transport  services  helps ensure  that  the  benefits \nderived from expressways filter down to the poor. The Government plans to invest CNY100 \nbillion  in  developing  rural  roads  during  the  11th  Five-Year  Program  (2006\u20132010).  The \nGovernment\u2019s commitment to reducing poverty through transport infrastructure is reflected in \nthe poverty partnership agreement between the Government and ADB.4 In Yunnan in the past 5 \nyears, the Government has invested CNY77.8 billion in road development, CNY32.3 billion of \nwhich in local roads, but it has difficulty sustaining this level of investment even with the \nGovernment\u2019s grant. \n \n6.  Yunnan has abundant natural resources. It has about 17.7 billion tons of coal reserves, \nninth highest in the PRC; its reserves of 25 minerals are among the top three; its reserves of \nhigh-quality iron and ore, lead, zinc, and tin rank first, and copper and nickel, third. It is the \nrichest in indium and cadmium, and the second richest in silver, germanium, and platinum. \nThree billion tons of phosphorus ore reserves have been proven, ranking first. High-value cash \ncrops  include  tobacco  and  sugar  cane,  both  ranked  first.  Yunnan  is  also  rich  in  tourism \nresources. It has more than 2 million hectares (ha) of nature reserves, the largest in the country, \nmaking up 5.1% of the province\u2019s total area. It has 6 national reserve parks, 43 provincial \nreserve parks, and 55 prefecture or county reserves. The province\u2019s tourism revenue in 2005 \nwas CNY41 billion, accounting for 12% of its total GDP. The revenue growth rate during 2001\u2013\n2005 was 14%, much higher than the industrial growth rate of 9% and the agriculture growth \nrate of 5%. Mountainous terrain and inadequate transportation have limited the shipping of \nnatural resources and the travel of domestic and international tourists. Investment in roads is \nexpected to substantially improve accessibility, and thereby provide jobs and income for local \npeople. Township and village enterprises, facilitated by road development, will be a major \nsource of rural jobs and economic development. \n \n7.  Since  the  PRC\u2019s  membership  in  the  World  Trade  Organization  in  December  2001, \npromoting international trade has assumed increasing importance for the Government. Located \nin the PRC\u2019s southwest, adjoining Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Thailand, and \nViet Nam, Yunnan is well placed. In 2000\u20132005, the province\u2019s international trade grew by 21% \nannually, reaching $4.7 billion in 2005, and Myanmar is the province\u2019s largest trade partner. \nSince 1995, the average trade growth rate between the PRC and the Association of South East \nAsian  Nations  has  reached  15%  annually.  Ten  Association  of  South  East  Asian  Nations \n                                                 \n2  In Liaoning and Yunnan provinces, construction of expressways, complemented by upgrading of local roads, was \nassociated with a significant increase in rural incomes in the project area (ADB. 2000.

ADB supports regional integration and launched \nthe Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) initiative in 1992. The GMS Cross-Border Transport \nAgreement was ratified by all the six GMS governments by 2005, and is expected to be fully \nimplemented by 2008. In Yunnan, ADB has financed three road projects, all part of the GMS \ntransport network planned to ease cross-border trade and investment. Major traded products \ninclude agriculture produce, textile products, natural resources, home electric appliances, and \nmotorcycles. An efficient and safe road transport system is more flexible and responsive to the \nneeds of the market economy than other transport modes. \n \n8.  The proposed Project represents the fourth road project in Yunnan under ADB financing. \nThe  first  two  projects5 have  been  successfully  completed  while  the  third  one6 is  being \nimplemented satisfactorily. The fourth will be an important section of the transport link between \nwestern PRC and the GMS countries. The proposed project expressway, connecting Kunming \nand Wuding (Map 1), constitutes a 66 km access-controlled four- to six-lane expressway with \ndesigned  speed  of  80\u2013100  km  per  hour.  The  Project  expressway  will  be  supported  by \nassociated  local  road  upgrading  and  other  complementary  components.  The  project  area \nincludes Xishan district; and Fumin, Luquan, and Wuding counties. The existing class-2 road \nbetween Kunming and Wuding comprises the 9 km Wuding\u2013Luquan section and the 71 km \nLuquan\u2013Kunming section. With the development of the western economic corridors, the road is \nsaturated with about 6,600 vehicles daily and cannot meet rapidly increasing traffic demand. Its \ntechnical standard confines the average speed on the road to less than 40 km per hour, which \ncannot meet rising demand for movement of goods and passengers.  \n \n9.  From a broader regional perspective (Map 2), the proposed Project will be an important \nlink to extend the cross-border expressway network from Kunming to Chengdu, the capital city \nand economic center of Sichuan Province; then to Mianyang, a manufacturing production base \nin Sichuan; and onward to Xi\u2019an, Taiyuan, and finally Beijing. It forms the starting section of the \neconomic corridor of Kunming\u2013Chengdu\u2013Xi\u2019an, a part of the Beijing\u2013Kunming section that is \none  of  the  seven  national  expressways  radiating  from  Beijing  in  the  National  Expressway \nNetwork Plan approved in 2005. It is also an important link in the Kunming\u2013Lanzhou corridor in \nthe PRC\u2019s Western Corridors Development Plan. There are three ADB-financed road projects in \nthis corridor: from Xichang to Panzhihua;7 from Ya\u2019an to Lugu;8 and from Wudu to the Sichuan\u2013\nGansu border, which is under processing for ADB consideration in 2006. These expressways \nwill support regional integration and facilitate the movement of goods, services, and people \nbetween western PRC and the GMS countries. \n \n10.  ADB\u2019s operational strategy in the PRC\u2019s road sector focuses on (i) constructing roads \nthat connect major growth centers and improve access in the western and central regions; (ii) \nintegrating the national trunk highway system with local road networks; (iii) developing roads \nthat support the regional cooperation initiatives, including GMS; (iv) promoting road safety and \nreducing  vehicle  emissions;  (v)  strengthening  the  corporatization  and  commercialization  of \nexpressway organizations; (vi) adopting pricing policies to ensure optimum use of road transport \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2001.

Since 1995, local \nroads have been included in the scope of road projects to make ADB\u2019s interventions in the road \nsector more pro-poor. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The TA will help develop an integrated road transport system supporting sustainable \neconomic growth in Yunnan Province and facilitating cooperation among GMS countries. The \nTA  will  (i)  help  the  Yunnan  Provincial  Communications  Department  (YPCD)  upgrade  the \nfeasibility study, including an environmental impact assessment (EIA) and a resettlement plan, \nto ensure that the Project conforms with ADB\u2019s requirements; and (ii) review road sector issues \nand provide the basis for strengthening the ongoing policy dialogue with the Government in key \nareas,  focusing  on  poverty  reduction,  road  safety,  vehicle  emission,  trade  facilitation  and \nregional integration, commercialization and corporatization, private sector participation, pricing \npolicies for road users, and transport services. The output will be a project suitable for ADB \nfinancing. A design and monitoring framework, outlining the expected impact, outcome, outputs, \nand activities is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The IPSA and REA (Appendix 2) carried out during fact-finding helped identify the social \nand environmental issues that need to be addressed during project preparation. The Fact-\nFinding Mission also reviewed the need to assess the social and environmental aspects for \nwhich ADB has established policies and norms of good practice. The IPSA examined poverty \nconditions, minority issues, resettlement effects, gender issues, and vulnerable groups, and \nconcluded that the key social issues to be assessed during project preparation are poverty \nimpact, resettlement effects, and an impact on ethnic minorities. The IPSA concluded that the \nProject should be in involuntary resettlement category A,9 requiring a full resettlement plan. The \nREA concluded that the Project should be in environmental category A, requiring a full EIA. The \nTA will examine the project documents, and prepare a Project that is feasible technically, \neconomically,  and  financially  and  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  policies  on  the \nenvironment, resettlement, and indigenous people. The TA will help develop a results-based \nmonitoring system with adequate baseline data. The key activities will include field surveys, \ndocument  review,  data  analysis,  and  discussion  with  stakeholders,  including  government \nofficials, project beneficiaries, and project-affected people. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $625,000,  of  which  the  Government  has \nrequested ADB to finance $500,000 (Appendix 3). The TA will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government will finance the balance equivalent to $125,000 by \nproviding counterpart staff, office facilities, and other support services. The Government has \nbeen informed that TA approval does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \n                                                 \n9  The proposed Project is likely to require about 416 ha, affecting about 5,000 people.

Poverty in the project area is mainly caused by the poor \nenvironment in this mountainous area and by lack of good transportation. The project road will link Wuding county to \nKunming, the capital of Yunnan. The expressway will be an important transport link in the Kunming\u2013Lanzhou corridor, \none of the PRC\u2019s eight western development corridors and a missing link of the Beijing\u2013Kunming section, one of the \nseven radiating expressways from Beijing in the PRC\u2019s National Expressway Network approved in 2005. The Project \nwill (i) reduce travel distance, time, and cost for passenger trips and freight transport; and (ii) improve trade between \nwestern PRC and the GMS countries, thereby developing the economy, creating jobs, and improving access to social \nservices. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \nThe Project will directly reduce poverty by creating construction jobs in the short term; improving access to markets for \ncash crops such as medicinal herbs, tobacco, sugar cane, and tea leaves; and attracting tourists.

Transportation  is \ninconvenient and education and medical facilities are basic. Per capita GDP in Luquan County, a major project-\naffected area, was only CNY2,600 in 2003, 46% of the provincial and 26% of the national average. The project area \n(three counties and four urban districts) has two nationally designated poverty counties. Many of the poor are \nmembers of ethnic minorities living in remote mountainous areas. \n \nA detailed poverty analysis will identify the causes of poverty in the project area and demonstrate how the Project will \nhelp reduce poverty by incorporating specific measures in its scope.

The financial assessment of the operating entity should include (i) \ncorporate planning and budgetary control, (ii) financial and management accounting, (iii) cost \naccounting, (iv) internal control and audit system, and (v) data processing. In light of ADB\u2019s \npolicy on governance,1 recommend ways to improve corporate governance of the expressway \noperating entity. \n \n10.  Review the current status of private sector participation in expressway development and \noperations  in  Yunnan  and  assess  the  potential  for  operating  the  project  expressway  as  a \ncorporation or as a concession by the private sector. Identify arrangements to implement such a \nstrategy, considering options such as leasing, securitization, joint venture, build-operate-transfer, \nand other arrangements for operation and maintenance. \n \nD.  Social and Poverty Analysis \n \n11.  Prepare socioeconomic and poverty profiles for the project area. The information should \ninclude  population,  income  levels,  occupations,  unemployment,  education  levels,  health \nconditions, transport expenditures, and other relevant socioeconomic data, separated by gender \nand ethnicity. Poverty incidence will be assessed based on the government poverty lines and $1 \na day (equivalent to CNY900 per year). Review the government\u2019s policy, strategy, and programs \nfor poverty reduction and regional economic development. Conduct surveys to develop a profile \nof transport services and costs, which are available in the project areas, and assess whether \naccessibility is affordable for low-income groups. \n \n12.  Based  on  the  initial  poverty  and  social  analysis,  conduct  a  full  poverty  and  social \nanalysis in accordance with ADB\u2019s Handbook on Poverty and Social Analysis (2001) and Policy \non Indigenous Peoples (1998). Assess how the proposed Project may help improve people\u2019s \nlivelihoods.  Assess  gender  issues,  ethnic  minority  issues,  identify  vulnerable  groups,  and \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1995. ADB\u2019s Policy on Governance. Manila. \n ", "  Appendix 4  15 \nrecommend  measures  to  address  impacts  and  promote  development  opportunities  during \nconstruction, and operation and maintenance of the Project. Estimate (i) the number of project \nbeneficiaries by area, occupation, and income; and (ii) the number of adversely affected people \nby type of impact. Assess the risks of HIV/AIDS and human and drug trafficking caused by the \nProject and propose mitigation measures for any high-risk groups. Quantify how the Project will \nimprove benefits for local people by income group and ethnicity. Formulate an ethnic minorities \ndevelopment action. \n \n13.  Help establish consultation and participatory processes during project preparation that \nwill continue throughout project design, construction, and operation. Stakeholders should be \nidentified and representatives consulted so their needs and demands can be considered for \nincorporation into the Project or as parallel initiatives. Prepare a stakeholder participation and \nconsultation report. \n \nE.  Environmental Impact Assessment \n14.  Review the project environmental impact assessment (EIA) to ensure it conforms to \nADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002). Assist the Yunnan Provincial Communications Department \n(YPCD) to carry out further investigations and analysis, and to finalize the environmental impact \nstatement, management plan, and monitoring plan. Prepare a summary EIA in accordance with \nADB requirements and a loan-processing schedule. Ensure that an EIA includes (i) mitigation of \nconstruction activity impacts; (ii) investigation and excavation procedures for cultural relics; (iii) \nroad safety measures; (iv) containment and cleanup of hazardous or toxic chemical spills; and \n(v) the benefits of proposed environmental enhancement measures that include the construction \nof sewer mains, trees, and other green space within the right-of-way.  \n \n15.  Assess  the  environmental  conditions  in  the  project  area  through  site  investigation, \nincluding natural resources, forests, cultural sites, and historical monuments, as well as the \ncurrent  negative  environmental  impacts  resulting  from  industrial  activities  and  road  traffic. \nReview the secondary environmental impacts arising from mineral exploitation, tourism, etc., \nand  propose  mitigation  measures.  Review  the  Government\u2019s  plan  to  reduce  adverse \nenvironmental impacts. Assess the direct and indirect environmental impacts of the Project \nresulting from construction activities or operation. \n \nF.  Resettlement Planning \n \n16.  Review the draft resettlement plan and help YPCD make modifications as required to \ncomply with ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement.2 The resettlement plan should address all \nproject components. Prepare a socioeconomic profile of project-affected households based on a \nsocioeconomic survey of 10% of the project-affected population (including 20% of the seriously \naffected  population),  including  income  levels  and  sources,  housing  conditions,  expenditure \npatterns, landholdings, skills base, and assets. Using primary and secondary data, assess the \nsocioeconomic  condition  of  affected  townships  and  villages/neighborhoods.  Assess  the \nsocioeconomic conditions, needs, and priorities of women affected by land acquisition and \nresettlement; identify specific measures to assist them; and ensure that land acquisition and \nresettlement do not disadvantage women. The resettlement plan must include a social impact \nassessment of project-affected people, land, assets, and occupations, indicating how the project \nimpacts on different groups. \n                                                 \n2  ADB.1995. ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement. Manila. \n ", "16  Appendix 4 \n \n17.  Assess and justify that (i) the compensation standards are based on replacement value; \n(ii) the overall resettlement budget is sufficient to implement the resettlement plan based on the \nproposed entitlements and rehabilitation plans; (iii) land is to be redistributed, confirm that \nadequate land is available for reallocation without negatively affecting the host population; and \n(iv) if relocation sites will be developed, ensure that project-affected people are consulted on the \nselection  of  sites  and  services.  For  seriously  affected  villages,  prepare  village  economic \nrehabilitation  plans  to  restore  incomes  of  project-affected  and  host  people.  For  affected \nhouseholds, assess the risks from land acquisition and related project impacts and formulate \nappropriate rehabilitation measures in consultation with project-affected people to ensure they \nare not worse off as a result of the Project. \n \n18.  Help YPCD prepare a public consultation and disclosure plan, develop a format for \ndocumenting consultation with project-affected people, and initiate a participatory process for \nresettlement plan preparation and implementation among affected communities, local leaders, \nproponents, and other stakeholders. Help the YPCD prepare a resettlement information booklet \nfor  distribution  to  all  project-affected  villages  and  households.  Review  the  organizational \nstructure  and  capacity  for  resettlement  implementation  and  recommend  improvements  and \nactions  required  before  the  start  of  land  acquisition.  Provide  training  to  YPCD  and  local \ngovernment staff on the ADB\u2019s Policy on involuntary resettlement (footnote 2) requirements and \nprocedures. \n \nG.  Road Transport Services and Trade Facilitation \n \n19.  Assess the provision of trucking and public transport services in the project area in terms \nof  pricing,  quality,  and  frequency  of  service.  Assess  the  degree  of  competition  and  the \nproportion of the reduced transport costs that are likely to be passed on to end users. Review \nthe conditions of road transport services, including passengers and freight in Yunnan in general, \nand in the project area in particular, and examine how such services can be improved to provide \nefficient services in the poor remote areas. Recommend suitable components, e.g., public \ntransport center, freight distribution center, improvement of bus services, and any others, for \ninclusion in the Project. \n \n20.  Review the current status of trade between Yunnan and neighboring Greater Mekong \nSubregion (GMS) countries. Evaluate the potential of trade development between western PRC \nand the GMS countries after the completion of the proposed Lanzhou\u2013Kunming corridor and the \nBeijing\u2013Kunming corridor. Assess the impact of the Project on trade in the short and long terms. \nRecommend practical project components to facilitate trade, considering physical infrastructure, \npolicy and institutional measures, and capacity building in selected cities, such as Hekou and \nKunming, e.g., intermodal transfer stations, warehouses and centralized distribution centers, \neconomic  development  zones,  trade  and  logistic  management  information  systems,  staff \ntraining in international trade standard, promotion measures, trade documentation and practice \naccepted by international importers and exporters, carriers, banks and insurance companies, \nand cross-border supply-chain management. \n \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20060529112053+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20060424093746+08'00'", "Title": "Microsoft Word - TA-PRC-Ojiro-CLEAN.doc", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Author": "RMT", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 6.0 (Windows)"}, "author_page": " \nCURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 17 April 2006) \n \nCurrency Unit \u2013  yuan (CNY) \nCNY1.00 =  $0.1249 \n$1.00 =  CNY8.0064 \n \n \nABBREVIATIONS \n \n  ADB  \u2013  Asian Development Bank \n  EIA  \u2013  environmental impact assessment \n  GMS  \u2013  Greater Mekong Subregion \n  GDP  \u2013  gross domestic product \n  IPSA  \u2013  initial poverty and social assessment \n  PRC  \u2013  People\u2019s Republic of China \n  REA  \u2013  rapid environmental assessment \n  TA  \u2013  technical assistance \n  VOC  \u2013  vehicle operating cost \n  YPCD  \u2013  Yunnan Provincial Communications Department \n \n \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CLASSIFICATION \n \nTargeting Classification  \u2013  General intervention \nSector  \u2013  Transport and communications \nSubsector  \u2013  Roads and highways \nThemes  \u2013  Sustainable economic growth and regional cooperation  \nSubthemes  \u2013  Promoting economic efficiency and enabling markets, and fostering \nphysical infrastructure development \n \n \nNOTE \n \nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n \n \n \n \nVice President  C.
