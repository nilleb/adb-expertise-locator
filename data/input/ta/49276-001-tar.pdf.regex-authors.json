INTRODUCTION \n1.  This technical assistance (TA) is provided by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in \nresponse to a request from the Government of India for help in developing an industrial corridor \nand implementing reforms to improve Rajasthan\u2019s ease of doing business ranking.1 Consultation \nmissions were fielded and the Government of India and ADB reached an agreement on the TA \ndesign and implementation arrangements. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix \n1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The revival of manufacturing is a key priority of the Government of India, as reflected in \nthe recent Make in India initiative portraying the sector as the engine of long-term growth. Indian \nmanufacturing has long stagnated at low levels, accounting for around 17.2% of gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) in FY2013 and 12.6% of employment in 2011/12.2 Government of India aims to \ntransform the sector by increasing its GDP share to 25% and creating 100 million jobs by 2022.3 \n \n3.  Rajasthan is one of India\u2019s lagging states, with a per capita income of about $1,200 in \nFY2013, below the national average of $1,500.4 Similarly, the performance of manufacturing \nsector in the state has been weaker than at the country with a GDP share of around 10% in \nFY2013 and an annual growth rate of less than 2% since FY2012, below the national average of \n6.2%. The sector employs 9% of Rajasthan\u2019s workforce, far below the national average of \n12.6%. With a large number of young people entering the labor force every year and a low skills \nbase, job creation has become a top priority of the Government of Rajasthan (the government).5  \n \n4.  The Make in India initiative and the associated Delhi\u2013Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC) \npresent major development opportunities for Rajasthan, especially with regard to job creation. \nThe DMIC is India's most ambitious infrastructure program aimed at developing new industrial \ncities as smart cities. This is intended to expand India's manufacturing and services base and \ndevelop the corridor as a \"Global Manufacturing and Trading Hub\". The DMIC will significantly \nboost planned urbanization in the country, with manufacturing as the key driver. \n \n5.  Rajasthan is a major DMIC partner as 60% of its area falls within the project influence \narea and 39% of the dedicated freight corridor passes through the state. Rajasthan\u2019s prospects \nfor industrial development are also good due to its proximity to the National Capital Region; \nabundance of land; and substantial resources of minerals, oil, and gas. \n \n6.  To  supplement  the  envisioned  infrastructure  development,  the  government  has \nimplemented several initiatives since 2013 to improve the business environment and attract \nmuch-needed  private  sector  investment  in  the  manufacturing  and  services  sectors. 6 \n                                                \n1  The vice president operations 1 approved the TA concept paper on 21 July 2015.The TA first appeared in the \nbusiness opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 4 September 2015. \n2  Government of India, Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, Central Statistical Office. FY2013 \nrefers to fiscal year 2013-14, starting on 1 April 2013 and ending on 31 March 2014. 2011/12 refers to period \nstarting from 1 July 2011 and ending on 30 June 2012.  \n3  Government of India, Ministry of Commerce and Industry. 2011. National Manufacturing Policy. New Delhi. \n4  The state is also lagging on various socioeconomic indicators compared with the national averages, including rates \nof literacy, net school enrollment, and infant and maternal mortality. \n5  About 55% of Rajasthan\u2019s population is below the age of 24, and around 25 million people will enter the workforce \nover the next 20 years. \n6  These  initiatives  include skills  development  and  employability  (e.g.,  the  Rajasthan  Mission  on Livelihoods); \ninvestment  promotion  (tax  incentives,  single  window  clearance,  dedicated  industrial  areas  for  Japanese \n ", "2 \n \nConsequently, Rajasthan was ranked sixth in a recent ease of doing business ranking of Indian \nstates released by the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion in September 2015. \nHowever,  the  government  is  aware  that  there  is  more  to  be  done.  Last-mile  connectivity \nproblems continue to reduce the impact of reforms. Also, it is crucial to continue strengthening \nof the regulatory environment and simplifying business processes, especially given increased \ninterstate competition for investments.  \n \n7.  Rajasthan can improve its domestic and international competitiveness by focusing on \nboth existing and potential productive industry clusters. A productive industry cluster is a group \nof firms closely linked by common product markets, labor pools, similar technologies, supply \nchains, infrastructure, technical colleges, and/or other economic ties. This cluster concept goes \nbeyond the traditional concept of a cluster as a horizontal network of firms operating in the same \nend-product market within the same industry group.7 Such a productive cluster development \napproach is important as the firms and organizations involved in clusters can synergize and \nleverage economic advantages from shared access to information and knowledge networks, \nsupply and distribution chains, markets and marketing intelligence, competencies, infrastructure, \nlow transaction and communication cost, and resources in a specific locality, thus leading to \noverall improved competitiveness and productivity of industry and state at large.  \n \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.   The TA impact will be a more investment-friendly climate, improved competitiveness of \nindustrial clusters in the Delhi\u2013Mumbai Industrial Corridor, and an increased employment rate in \nRajasthan, in alignment with the state\u2019s Twelfth Five-Year Plan, 2012\u20132017.8 The outcome will \nbe strengthened government capacity to develop productive clusters and the economic corridor. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA will include two major outputs: \n \n(i)  Cluster  development  plan  for  accelerated  industrial  development  in \nRajasthan  completed.  This  output  will  identify  (i)  productive  clusters  in \nRajasthan;  (ii)  an  infrastructure  and  regulatory  strategy  to  increase  the \ncompetitiveness of these clusters; and (iii) a set of priority projects, particularly \nlast-mile connectivity projects, to unlock the potential of the identified clusters.9 \nThe  TA  will  also  suggest  improvements  to  Rajasthan\u2019s  regulatory  business \nenvironment. The state\u2019s businesses need to be able to (i) access India\u2019s vast \ndomestic market more efficiently and cheaply, and (ii) link up with global value \nchains to create more jobs and expand operations. Improved processes and \nregulations  are  necessary  to  remove  existing  bottlenecks  and  ensure  the \ncontinued improvement of Rajasthan\u2019s investment climate.  \n \n                                                                                                                                                       \ninvestment, and the DMIC); land acquisition (land pooling); and labor reforms (laying off workers, reducing the \nnumber of trade unions, reducing the compliance burden, and implementing the apprenticeship act). \n7  Enright and Roberts. 2001.

Jaipur. \n \n ", "3 \n \n(ii)  Capacity  building  on  the  design,  development,  and  management  of \nproductive  clusters  and  economic  corridors  implemented.  The  TA  will \nstrengthen the capacity of relevant government agencies to sustainably improve \nbusiness  and  regulatory  changes  (which  often  require  many  departments  to \ncoordinate closely), and enhance harmonization and information-sharing across \ndepartments  and  divisions.  The  management,  planning,  and  maintenance  of \ninfrastructure  also  require  special  skills  and  increased  information  sharing. \nWorkshops will be held to increase knowledge about ongoing activities (such as \ncomprehensive urban planning), the relevance of industrial clusters to regional \ndevelopment,  and  the  importance  of  synchronizing  the  implementation  of \nindustrial  and  urban  policy  reforms  and  programs. Workshops  and  capacity-\nbuilding  programs  will  be  organized  for  government  agencies  to  increase \nawareness of the significance of productive clusters and economic corridors in \norder to spur industrial development, economic growth, and job creation. Training \nmodules on ease of doing business, with perspectives from other states, will also \nbe designed. \n \n10.  Key risks include (i) inadequate government ownership within the state to implement \nregulatory reforms and/or invest in infrastructure within the identified productive clusters; (ii) \ndelayed  completion  of  the  cluster  development  plan  due  to  difficulties  building  consensus \namong the numerous stakeholders in the planned industrialization project; and (iii) constraints \nrelated to social and/or environmental aspects, public financial management, procurement, and \ncorruption.  Consulting  with  stakeholders  regularly  would  mitigate  these  risks,  and  regular \ndissemination workshops will inform stakeholders of the findings of the studies conducted under \nthe TA. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.01 million, of which $1 million will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The cost estimates \nand financing plan are in Appendix 2. The government will provide counterpart support in the \nform  of  counterpart  staff,  office  space,  office  supplies,  domestic  transportation,  workshop \nvenues, remuneration and per diem of counterpart staff, and other in-kind contributions. The \nvalue of the government contribution is estimated to account for 1% of the total TA cost.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  from  January  2016  to  December  2017.  ADB\u2019s  India \nResident Mission will administer the TA and the Department of Industries, Rajasthan will be the \nexecuting agency. The TA will be implemented in close coordination with the Rajasthan State \nIndustrial  Development  and  Investment  Corporation,  the  Japan  Bank  for  International \nCooperation, Japan International Cooperation Agency, and internal partners, including ADB\u2019s \nSouth Asia Regional Cooperation and Operations Coordination Division and South Asia Urban \nDevelopment and Water Division. \n \n13.  The TA will engage a consulting firm as well as individual consultants. The TA provides \nfor  12  person-months  of  international  consultant  inputs  and  78  person-months  of  national \nconsultant inputs. The consultants will include (i) an industrial cluster specialist and team leader \n(international, 6 person-months); (ii) a transport expert (national, 6 person-months); (iii) an \nurban  infrastructure  expert  (national,  6  person-months);  (iv)  an  energy  expert  (national,  6 \nperson-months); (v) a policy and regulatory expert (national, 6 person-months); (vi) economists \n ", "4 \n \nand/or  analysts  (national,  2,  12  person-months  each);  (vii)  a  capacity  development  expert \n(national, 6 person-months); (viii) a coordination expert (national, 24 person-months); (ix) an \nindustry  economist  (international,  2  person-months);  (x)  an  urban  infrastructure  specialist \n(international, 2 person-months); and (xi) a policy and regulatory specialist (international, 2 \nperson-months). \n \n14.  The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3.  ADB will engage \nconsultants in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended \nfrom time to time). Consulting firms will express their interest through a simplified technical \nproposal and will be engaged using quality- and cost-based selection. The method for engaging \nindividual  consultants  will  be  decided  on  a  case-to-case  basis.  Output-based  lump-sum \npayments contracts will be considered. Disbursements under this TA will be made in keeping \nwith ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time) \nand all procurements will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to \ntime). ADB will also provide workshop venues and consultation activities organized at the India \nResident Mission. \n \n15.  The TA will be monitored through the evaluation of consultant outputs, regular reporting, \nand feedback solicited from key stakeholders. Consultants will submit progress reports to be \nevaluated thoroughly in consultation with the core team members, who will provide detailed \nfeedback. The progress reports will be closely monitored and evaluated against the agreed \ntimelines and terms of reference. Annual TA progress reports detailing the status of the TA \nactivities will be submitted to the donors.  A TA completion report evaluating the achieved \noutputs against the targets will be prepared at the end of the project, and the findings will be \nshared with the donors and other stakeholders. \n \n16.  Consultation workshops will be held regularly to discuss the progress of the TA, its \nfindings, and any issues involved. The development results of the TA and lessons learned will \nbe disseminated in the India\u2013ADB partnership publications and other ADB reports. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n17.   The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $1,000,000  to  the \nGovernment of India to be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction \nfor Supporting Rajasthan\u2019s Productive Clusters in the Delhi\u2013Mumbai Industrial Corridor, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board.  \n \n ", "Appendix 1  5 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpacts the TA is aligned with: \nA more investment-friendly climate, increased competitiveness of industrial clusters in the Delhi\u2013Mumbai \nIndustrial Corridor, and a higher employment rate in Rajasthan (Rajasthan Twelfth Five-Year Plan, 2012-\n2017)a \nPerformance Indicators  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  with Targets and Baselines  Reporting   Risks \nOutcome       \n     \nCapacity of the \nA cluster development  Official website of the  Inadequate \nGovernment of \nplan for each of the  Bureau of Investment  government ownership \nRajasthan to develop \nidentified productive  Promotion, Rajasthan  within the state to \nproductive clusters \nclusters to speed up the    implement regulatory \nand the economic \nindustrial development of  Economic Review and/or  reforms and/or invest \ncorridor strengthened \nRajasthan approved by  State Budget,  in infrastructure within \n2017 (2015 baseline:  Government of Rajasthan  the identified \nNone)    productive clusters \n   \n   \nAt least one infrastructure  Economic Review and/or \ndevelopment investment  State Budget, \nproject to strengthen the  Government of Rajasthan \nidentified productive \nclusters in Rajasthan \nincluded in the India \ninvestment program for \n2018 (2015 baseline: Not \napplicable) \n       \nOutputs       \n1.

Power:  Demand  estimation  in  the  cluster  looking  at  the  industry  profile; \nassessing supply options including assessing the feasibility of conventional fuels \n(coal and gas), and the potential of nonconventional sources (wind and solar) to \nsupply power to the cluster and; assessing available infrastructure to meet the \ncluster\u2019s requirements. \n \n(b)  Identify early-bird infrastructure projects to support the identified industrial \nclusters  by  examining  all  possible  interventions,  from  last-mile \nconnectivity to hinterland connections. \n \n(iv)  Perform a regulatory framework assessment to understand the extent to which \nexisting rules and regulations (and their implementation) impede the operation \nand growth of the identified productive clusters. This assessment will take into \naccount cluster-specific requirements and will \n(a)  analyze key aspects of the regulation and administrative processes that \ncould  reduce  the  competitiveness  of  existing  productive  clusters  and \nimpede the creation of new productive clusters; \n(b)  assess ongoing work, propose recommendations to streamline processes, \nand  improve  the  implementation  of  existing  regulations  and  policy \nmeasures; and \n(c)  assess  the  regulatory  environment  for  small  and  medium-sized \nenterprises  and  the  extent  to  which  existing  policy  measures  and \nregulations  are  implemented,  and  suggest  ways  to  improve \nimplementation and streamline existing measures. \n \n(v)  Conduct an institutional assessment of agencies whose activities directly impact \ndevelopment and management of clusters. This should also include identification \nof governance structure for the identified clusters and an assessment of capacity \nof selected urban municipalities to support subsidiary \u201csoft\u201d infrastructure (such \nas ability to provide multimodal transport, good housing, and their financial and \nimplementation capacity to deliver the \u201clast mile\u201d of infrastructure and services), \nOther agencies\u2019 ability to implement the measures necessary to support the \nidentified clusters also needs to be assessed. \n \n(vi)  Develop capacity building and training programs for government agencies to \nincrease awareness of the significance of productive cluster development and \nmanagement, assess staff capacity, and prepare training materials. The training \nmodules will cover such topics as synchronizing urban planning and industrial \npolicy, the benefits of industrial clusters and economic corridors, and ways to \npromote international competitiveness, as well as more hands-on training such \nas in information technology and data entry to ensure efficient implementation of \nexisting government initiatives to improve ease of doing business. \n ", "Appendix 3  11 \n(vii)  Develop a concise productive cluster development approach paper that pulls \ntogether the elements of (i)\u2013(vi). \n \n3.
