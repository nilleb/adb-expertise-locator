THE ENSUING PROJECT \n1.  The proposed project will help finance new construction, rehabilitation, and modernization \nof specific items of medium-scale rural infrastructure which are either non-existent or have \ndeteriorated over the past decades due to disasters triggered by natural hazards, and severe \nbudgetary constraints that have contributed to this progressive deterioration. Infrastructure to be \nimproved will include, but not limited to the following: (i) rural roads, (ii) irrigation drainage and \nflood control schemes, (iii) rural markets, (iv) solid waste disposal and collection, and (v) domestic \nwater supply and sanitation schemes. As such, the project will help improve the livelihoods of the \nrural population by (i) increasing access to markets, agricultural inputs, and public services such \nas health and education; (ii) increasing employment opportunities; and (iii) reducing vulnerability \nto  disasters  due  to  natural  hazards.  The  proposed  project  will  have  two  outputs:  (i)  rural \ninfrastructure in the project areas constructed and/or modernized; and (ii) capacity for devolved \ndevelopment and management of rural infrastructure strengthened. These outputs will result in \nthe following outcome: rural productivity increased. The project will be aligned with the following \nimpact: livelihoods and standards of living for rural population improved. \n \n2.  The project is estimated to cost $140 million. ADB will finance $100 million from its ordinary \ncapital resources (concessional loans) and the government of the Republic of Uzbekistan (the \ngovernment) will finance $40 million through exemptions of taxes and duties. The sector modality \nis used for the proposed project since it will provide selective support for the Prosperous Village \nProgram as the sector development plan, which highlights key investment requirements and \npolicy development for comprehensive and inclusive rural development.

Outputs and Activities \n \n4.  The TA has three outputs: (i) Output 1: the IFS conducted; (ii) Output 2: the NFS prepared. \nThe NFS shall be prepared as a requirement of the government in processing its approval of the \nproject after ADB\u2019s approval; and (iii) Output 3: loan processing and implementation startup \nexpedited. \n \n1.  Output 1\u2014Conducting the Investment Feasibility Study \n \n5.
