During the 2003 Country Programming Mission for the People's Republic of China (PRC), \nthe Government confirmed its request for technical assistance (TA) to prepare an integrated roads \ndevelopment project  (the Project)  in central Sichuan Province.1 The Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) Fact-Finding Mission visited the PRC in October 2003; traveled to the project area; carried \nout an initial poverty and social assessment (IPSA) and rapid environmental assessment (REA); \nand discussed economic, social development,  and project-specific issues with officials of the \ncentral and local governments. This report is based on the understanding reached with the \nGovernment  on  the  objectives,  scope,  costs,  terms  of  reference,  and  implementation \narrangements for the TA, and the Mission's observations in the field. The TA framework, outlining \nthe goal, purpose, outputs, and inputs, is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The PRC's rapid economic growth over the last decade has substantially increased the \ndemand  for  transport  services.  The  changing  structure  and  increasing  sophistication  of  the \neconomy have altered the pattern of transport demand, with rapid growth in the demand for road \ntransport compared with other modes. Road traffic grew at 9.4% per annum for passenger traffic, \nreaching 781 billion passenger-kilometers (km), and 6.1% per annum for freight, reaching 678 \nbillion ton-km in 2002. The continued development of the private sector and light manufacturing \nindustries, expansion of the service sector, increasing volumes of intra- and interprovincial trade, \nand rapidly growing demand for passenger travel favor the development of flexible, efficient, and \nmarket-responsive road transport services. Car ownership is growing rapidly, and an increasing \nproportion of passengers are traveling by road. The PRC\u2019s road network grew from 1.16 million \nkm in 1995 to 1.76 million km in 2002, equivalent to an annual increase of 85,700 km. Of this, the \nexpressway length increased from 2,141 km to 25,200 km during the same period. 2 However, the \nroad network is still underdeveloped in quality and extent. High standard roads, i.e., above class \nII,3 account for only about 14% of the total road network; the remaining 86% (class III road and \nbelow) are medium- to low-grade paved and gravel roads. With only 1,285 km of roads per million \ninhabitants and  18.3 km per 100 km2 in 2002, the density of the PRC's road network is low, \nresulting in serious transport capacity constraints and bottlenecks. \n \n3.  In Sichuan Province, road traffic grew at a slower pace than the national average: 6.5% \nper annum for passenger traffic, reaching 45 billion passenger-km, and 3.4% per annum for \nfreight traffic, reaching 24 billion ton-km. Road traffic accounts for  about two thirds  of total \npassenger traffic and  one third of total freight traffic. The road network  in Sichuan remains \nunderdeveloped. The total road length was 111,898 km in 2002, including 1,501 km expressway. \nHigh standard roads, i.e., above class II, were 11,593 km, accounting for only about 10% of the \ntotal road network, and the remaining  90% are class III roads. With only 1,320 km of roads per \nmillion inhabitants and 23.1 km of road per 100 square kilometers of land, the density of the \nSichuan Province\u2019s road network is low. By 2005, the total road length is expected to reach \n116,000 km (including 1,700 km of expressways and 14,000 km of class II and above roads). In \naddition, 4,500 km of county roads extending to poor remote areas will be completed. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 16 May 2003. \n2 The PRC has the world\u2019s second longest expressway system after the United States. \n3 Highways generally capable of accommodating 3,000\u20137,500 vehicles per day in the medium size truck equivalent \nwithin the expected design life.  ", "2 \n4.  The link between road development and poverty reduction is supported by studies and \nthe evaluation of several completed road projects financed by ADB4 and the World Bank.5 \nPreliminary findings of an ongoing TA6 have confirmed that the contribution of road investments \nto economic growth and poverty reduction in the PRC as well as the validity of the geographic \nfocus of the road portfolio on the poorer western interior province.  They also revealed that \ncomplimentary  investments  in  local  roads  would  strengthen  the  impact  of  expressway \ninvestments and that well-integrated road investments help ensure that the benefits derived \nfrom the expressway filter down to the poor. A detailed case study in Shaanxi also found that \nimproved roads were correlated with poverty reduction.7 Several studies and feedback from \nconsultation with the poor have found that adequate transport infrastructure is a prerequisite for \nreducing poverty, and involving the participation of local communities increase the likelihood of \nsuccess of road projects. Benefits for poor rural areas include lower transport costs; lower cost \nof inputs, expanded agricultural support services; improved farming practices; greater access to \nemployment opportunities in urban areas; and better access to health, education, and social \nservices.8  A prominent feature of the PRC\u2019s poverty reduction strategy since the mid-1980s has \nbeen to accelerate investment in rural infrastructure. Investment in rural roads, for example, \ngrew by 23% annually in the 1990s\u2014more than double the annual growth in the 1980s.9 \n \n5.  The Government\u2019s policy for the road sector, as reflected in its Tenth Five Year Plan \n(2001\u20132005), calls for (i) accelerating the construction of the network of highways and national \nroads, with focus on five north-south and seven east-west sections of the national trunk highway \nsystem; (ii) commencing construction of eight new highways in the western region (total 18,000 \nkm); and (iii) by 2005, having approximately 1.95 million km of highways open to traffic, with \nexpressways accounting for 35,000 km. In 2003, the Government announced plans for 5,300 \nrural road projects with a total length of 78,000 km. A total of 176,000 km of rural roads will be \nbuilt in the following 3 years, with an investment of $6 billion (CNY50 billion) provided by the \ncentral Government. Currently, 184 towns and 54,000 villages have no access to roads, most of \nwhich are in the western region. The plan is to develop road network that will reach 99.8% of \ntowns and 96.0% of villages by 2005. By the end of 2010, all towns and villages will be \nconnected to roads. This major program will be a pro-poor initiative since in many surveys the \npoor ranked improved roads as one of their highest development priorities. The Government\u2019s \ncommitment to reducing poverty through transport infrastructure investment is reflected in the \npoverty partnership agreement between the Government and ADB. \n \n6.  The private sector will be the PRC\u2019s engine of employment generation and a main \nmechanism to increase productivity\u2014two essential instruments to reduce poverty. According to \nthe ADB surveys,10 infrastructure constraints are among the impediments faced by private \n                                                 \n4  In Liaoning and Yunnan provinces, construction of expressways complemented by local road upgrading was \nassociated with a significant increase in rural incomes in the project area.

Of 756 domestic private firms interviewed, 21% cited poor \nroads as a major constraint after a lack of land and buildings. Among foreign firms, 39% would \nnot expand their operations into the central and western provinces and infrastructure constraints \nwere  one  of  the  barriers  most  frequently  cited.  It  is  imperative  that  road  infrastructure  be \nimproved to attract private investment to the poor interior provinces. \n \n7.  Sichuan is a poor interior province located in the southwest PRC. With an area of 487,600 \nsquare kilometers and population of 84.7 million, Sichuan is one of the largest and most populous \nprovinces of the PRC. Sichuan\u2019s gross domestic product per capita was $697 (CNY5,766) in \n2002, 71% of the national average, and per capita rural income was $255 (CNY2,108), 85% of the \nnational average.  About one third of the counties in Sichuan  are officially designated poor \ncounties. About 3 million people live below a rural per capita income of $76 (CNY625). One of the \nreasons  for  relatively  high  poverty  incidence  is  slow  economic  growth,  partly  because  of \ninadequate infrastructure  despite the  considerable investments. The bottlenecks in the road \nnetwork hamper efficient transport access to large parts of the country. Better transport links are \nnecessary to improve economic efficiency, foster domestic and international trade, facilitate \ninterregional integration, and reduce poverty. \n \n8.  In Sichuan Province, significant road sector development is being implemented during \nthe Tenth Five-Year Plan (2001\u20132005). Because of the need to remove transport bottlenecks to \nfacilitate efficient, sustained economic growth and reduce poverty, Sichuan Province is investing \n$8.0 billion (CNY67 billion) during the Tenth Five Year Plan, up from $2.8 billion (CNY23 billion), \nduring the  Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996\u20132000). The road sector investment  is growing  at an \naverage annual rate of 13% during this period. The Government will have difficulty sustaining this \nlevel of investment even with official development assistance. \n \n9.  A proposed Project constitutes a 244-km access controlled four-lane expressway that will \nstart 140 km southwest of Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province, and extend southward to \nLugu. The expressway forms part of the main 900-km north-south route connecting Chengdu and \nKunming, the capital of Yunnan Province and is part of eight western corridors included in the \nGovernment\u2019s Western Region Development Strategy. The expressway will traverse one district \n(Yuchen  in  Ya\u2019an  City)  and  four  counties  (Yingjing,  Hanyuan,  Mianning,  and Shimian in \nLiangshan Yi Minority Autonomous Prefecture). The Project area will cover 12,288 km2 and a \npopulation in 2002 of 1.3 million, of which 1.0 million are rural (80%). The per capita gross \ndomestic product in this area, $764 (CNY6,324), is lower than the national average $989 \n(CNY8,184). The average  rural income is $260 (CNY2,150) per capita. The number of rural \nresidents with an annual income below $121 (CNY1,000) is 237,214 (24% of the population). \nThe four counties are all provincial level poverty counties. The severe socioeconomic conditions \nin this area were verified during the field investigation. \n \n10.  The Project is  the third road project in Sichuan for ADB financing. The first one, the \nChengdu-Nanchong Expressway Project,11 was successfully opened to traffic in December 2003, \nand  was  awarded  a  national  prize  by  the  Ministry  of  Communications  as  a  high  quality \nexpressway project. It contributed to poverty reduction by integrating expressway development \nwith local road network improvement. Construction is starting on the Southern Sichuan Roads \nDevelopment Project.12 The proposed project expressway will link up with the second project in \nLugu. Lessons learned from the ongoing ADB-financed projects in Sichuan will be reviewed under \nthe TA and incorporated in the project design.

", "4 \ndeveloped communities, the TA will study the local road network and identify local roads in the \nProject area that could be included in the project scope. As the project expressway will be in \nmountainous terrain at  500\u20131,500 meters above sea level, and involve extensive tunnels and \nbridges accounting for 39% of the total length, the TA will carefully review design and construction \nmethods  to  address  this  technical challenge.  Traffic on the  existing  330-km  road,  National \nHighway 108, is 763\u20134,409 vehicles per day (in medium truck units), depending on road sections \nand has been growing at about 10% per annum in the last 5 years.  \n \n11.  ADB's  operational  strategy 13  in  the  PRC\u2019s  road  sector  is  designed  to  remove \ninfrastructure constraints and support policy and institutional reforms.  Since 1991, ADB has \nprovided 27 loans totaling $4.8 billion to finance 3,555 km of highway development. The broad \nscope of these projects has included improving 5,826 km of local roads. Local roads have been \nincluded in the project scopes since 1995 to make ADB's road projects more pro-poor. All the \nADB  loans  are  generally  being  implemented  satisfactorily.14 With  the  completion  of  the \nnortheast transport corridor, the focus of ADB's activities in the road sector has shifted to poorer \nprovinces in the western and central regions. The strategy supports (i) constructing roads that \nconnect major growth centers and improve access in the western and central regions; (ii) \nintegrating the national trunk highway system with local roads networks, particularly those that \nprovide access to poor areas; (iii) promoting road safety and vehicle emission reductions; (iv) \nstrengthening  the  corporatization  and  commercialization  of  expressway  organizations;  (v) \nadopting appropriate pricing policies to ensure optimum use of road transport capacity; and (vi) \nusing alternative methods of investment financing, including private sector participation. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n12.  The TA will (i) assist  the Sichuan Provincial Communications Department (SPCD) in \nupgrading the feasibility study, including environmental impact assessment (EIA) and resettlement \nplan for the proposed  Central Sichuan Roads Development  Project in conformity with ADB\u2019s \nrequirements; and (ii) review the road sector issues and provide the basis for strengthening the \nongoing policy dialogue with the Government in the key areas, focusing on the poverty impact of \nroad  projects,  road  safety,  vehicle  emissions,  commercialization  and  corporatization,  private \nsector development, pricing policies for road users, and public transport services. The output will \nbe a project suitable for ADB financing. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  Government preparation for the Project has reached an advanced stage. The feasibility \nstudy and the EIA have been prepared and a resettlement plan will be prepared soon. The IPSA \n(Appendix 2) and REA (Appendix 2) carried out during fact-finding helped identify the social and \nenvironmental issues that need to be  addressed during project preparation. They also reviewed \nthe need for assessing the social  and environmental aspects for which ADB has established \npolicies and norms of good practice. The  IPSA examined  poverty conditions, minority issues, \nresettlement effects, gender issues,  and vulnerable groups, and concluded that  the key social \nissues to be assessed during project preparation are poverty impact, resettlement effects, and \nminority people. The REA concluded that the Project should be a category A project, requiring a \n                                                 \n13 ADB. 2003.

The project performance audit reports for four road projects concluded that the projects were \neither highly successful or successful. ", "  5 \nfull EIA to be prepared. The TA will examine the available project documents,15 and prepare a \nproject that is feasible from the technical, economic, and financial points of view and is in \ncompliance with ADB\u2019s safeguard policies on environment, resettlement, and indigenous people. \nThe key activities will include field surveys; document review; data analysis; and discussion with \nstakeholders, including government officials, project beneficiaries, and affected people. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $880,000 equivalent, which consists of $490,000 in \nforeign exchange cost and $390,000 equivalent in local currency cost. The Government has \nrequested ADB to finance $700,000 equivalent covering the entire foreign exchange cost and \n$210,000 equivalent of local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA \nfunding program. The Government will finance the balance of the local currency cost, equivalent \nto $180,000, through the provision of counterpart staff, office facilities, and other support services. \nDetailed cost estimates are  provided in Appendix  3. The Government has been advised that \napproval of the TA does not commit ADB to financing any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  A team from an international consulting firm in association with domestic consultants will \nbe engaged by ADB using the simplified technical proposal procedures in accordance with ADB's \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other  arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the \nselection and engagement of domestic consultants. The TA will require about 17 person-months \nof international consulting services and 23 person-months of domestic consulting services to carry \nout the study as defined in the terms of reference (Appendix 4). The international consultants will \nhave expertise in (i) highway engineering, (ii) transport economics, (iii) financial analysis and \nexpressway operation, (iv) environmental analysis,   (v) poverty and social analysis, and (vi) \nresettlement. The international consultants will be encouraged to utilize domestic consultants in \nthe above fields.  \n \n16.  SPCD, as the Executing Agency for the TA, will appoint suitable counterpart staff who will \nbe responsible for supervision and coordination of TA activities, including monitoring of progress, \nresolving any issues that may arise during implementation, assisting in arranging meetings, and \nliaising  with  government  agencies  and  organizations.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  will  ensure \ncoordination  among  the  National  Development  and  Reform  Commission,  Ministry  of \nCommunications, State Environmental Protection Administration, SPCD, and other government \noffices relevant to the TA. The consultants are expected to be fielded by mid-May 2004, and carry \nout their work for 5 months. The TA is expected to be completed in mid-October 2004. Workshops \ninvolving the Government, ADB,  and the consultants will be held in the PRC to review the \nconsultant\u2019s reports.  The  equipment  to  be  provided  under  the  TA  will  be  procured  by  the \nconsultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $700,000, on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for preparing the Central Sichuan Roads \nDevelopment Project, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n15 Project documents were prepared in two separate parts: Ya\u2019an to Shimian and Shimian to Lugu.

Yes  country poverty partnership agreement?  Yes \n   \n \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in the People\u2019s Republic of China: The \ntransport sector contributes to poverty reduction directly through improved access to markets, \nemployment  opportunities,  and  social  services,  and  indirectly  by  stimulating  economic \ndevelopment. Despite good natural resources, the project area has lagged behind in terms of \neconomic development mainly due to lack of good transportation, which is currently limited to a \nclass II or III highway. The Project will link the project area to the existing Chengdu-Ya\u2019an \nexpressway and the Xichang-Panzhihua expressway that is currently under construction with \nAsian Development Bank funding. The proposed Ya\u2019an-Lugu expressway will reduce travel time \nand cost for passenger trips and freight transport, thereby facilitating economic and tourism \ndevelopment, job creation, and improved access to social services.    \n \n \n2.  Poverty Analysis   Proposed Classification: Other \n \nThe  Project  will  directly  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  in  the  project  area  by  generating \nconstruction employment opportunities in the short term and improving access to market for cash \ncrops.  The  Project  will  substantially  improve  transport  infrastructure  that  will  facilitate \ndevelopment mineral and tourism resources and thereby indirectly provide greater employment \nand income generation opportunities for local people.   \n \nFurther, the Project will improve access to social services in the county centers and larger cities. \nThe  local  people  have  inconvenient  transportation  and  very  basic  education  and  medical \nfacilities. The poverty incidence in the project area is estimated to be (i) 71,400 people, or 7%, \nbased on the national poverty line of $76 (CNY625) income; and (ii) 237,214, or 24%, based on \nthe provincial poverty line of $121 (CNY1,000) income. \n \nA detailed poverty analysis will be carried out to identify the causes of poverty in the project area \nand demonstrate how the Project will help reduce poverty by incorporating specific measures in \nthe project scope. The analysis will be based on the Handbook on Poverty and Social Analysis \nand Handbook for Integrating Poverty Impact Assessment in the Economic Analysis of Projects. \n \n \n3.  Participation Process \n \nStakeholder analysis: Some public consultation has been carried  out  by  the  Executing Agency ", "Appendix 2  9\nduring the preparation of the feasibility study and by the research institute that prepared the \nenvironmental impact assessment. Further consultation will be carried out during the technical \nassistance (TA) to enhance the environmental management plan, conduct social surveys of \naffected people and ethnic minorities, and prepare the resettlement plan. This will be included in \nthe TA. \nParticipatory strategy required:  In order to enhance benefits to the poor and particularly ethnic \nminorities, a participation strategy will need to be developed under the TA. This may focus on \nlocal roads and/or other rural development support. \n \n \n4.  Gender Issues \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: Expressway projects tend to be gender neutral, since \nthe benefits accrue at the household level. In this remote area, employment of women for \nconstruction work is limited and constrained by the need for women to handle household work \nand animal husbandry. The TA will investigate opportunities to enhance the benefits to women \n(e.g., through adult education and skills training in cash crops, animal husbandry, tourism). \nParticular focus will be placed on ethnic minority women, as they tend to drop out of school and \nhave limited skills for outside work. \nGender plan to be prepared?

Review the draft resettlement plan (RP) and prepare modifications as required to comply \nwith ADB\u2019s Handbook on Resettlement 1998. The RP should address all project components \nincluding  the  expressway,  local  roads,  access  roads,  and  construction  areas.  Conduct \nresettlement household surveys to ensure adequate understanding of social impacts. Quantify the \ntypes  and  degree  of  impacts  on  the  affected  people.  Help  formulate  a  resettlement  plan  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Safeguard Policy requirements. Document in the \nRP  the  extent  to  which  the  project  design  and  alignment  has  avoided  or  minimized  land \nacquisition and displacement of people and businesses. Identify potential impoverishment risks \nand vulnerable groups, including those severely affected through loss of land, those with low \nincome, and others (e.g., the disabled, the elderly, ethnic minorities, the unemployed, illiterate \npeople, women, and children) and develop special mitigation measures, as required.  \n \n32.  Prepare an entitlements matrix covering compensation and other assistance for all types \nof impacts to achieve full replacement for lost assets, income, and livelihoods. The entitlements \nshould be based on the PRC Land Administration Law, local government regulations, and ADB\u2019s \npolicy  on  involuntary  resettlement.  For  seriously  affected  villages,  prepare  village  economic \nrehabilitation  plans  to  restore  incomes  of  affected  people  and  host  people  including  specific \nmeasures for the severely affected, poor, ethnic minorities (especially the Yi). Assess whether the \noverall resettlement budget is sufficient to acquire the land and implement the resettlement plan \nbased on the proposed entitlements and rehabilitation plans. \n \n33.  Assist Sichuan Provincial Communications Department (SPCD), the executing agency to \nexpand consultation with the affected communities, local leaders, proponents, and stakeholders\u2019 \nwho may be opposed to the Project. Assess stakeholders concerns and consider possible \nchanges in the project design to minimize land acquisition and resettlement effects. Assist SPCD \nto  prepare  a  resettlement  information  booklet  and  distribute  to  all  affected  villages  and \nhouseholds.  Ensure  that  Chinese  versions  of  the  RP  are  distributed  to  all  relevant  local \ngovernment offices and affected village leaders. \n \n34.  Review  the organizational structure and capacity for resettlement implementation and \nrecommend improvements and actions required before the start of land acquisition. Assist SPCD \nto prepare a detailed resettlement implementation schedule that is linked to the overall project \nschedule. A summary of milestones for resettlement supervision should be developed and agreed \nto with SPCD and ADB prior to finalization of the RP. The RP will include a plan for regular internal \nmonitoring and supervision by SPCD, and terms of reference for periodic external monitoring, and \nevaluation by an independent agency.
