THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FACILITY \n \nA.  Justification \n \n1.  The proposal. The transaction technical assistance (TA) facility will support project \npreparation, increase project readiness of pipeline projects, and support ongoing projects with \nadditional expertise as required and agreed with the project executing agency. The TA will also \nprovide support to ensure project sustainability and transfer capacity through specific training and \nskills-building activities as required. Initially, the TA facility will support: \n \n(i)  Preparing Outer Islands for Sustainable Development (POISED) Project,1 \n(ii)  Additional financing for POISED project,2 and \n(iii)  Greater Mal\u00e9 Energy Sector Project.3 \n   \n2.  Sector overview. Maldives, located 750 kilometers (km) southwest of Sri Lanka, is an \narchipelago consisting of 26 atolls4 and a total land area of about 300 square km. About half of \nthe country\u2019s population lives on the outer islands. Maldives has about 290 megawatts (MW) of \ninstalled diesel generation capacity in 186 inhabited islands, and additional generators in tourism \n(about 144 MW) and in industrial islands (20 MW). A total of 21.5 MW of renewable energy \nsystems are installed across the country. The demand for electricity is expected to grow annually \nby 8.5%, out of which the Greater Mal\u00e9 region accounts for approximately 55% of the total \nprojected electricity demand of all the inhabited islands. Generation capacity is not optimized due \nto lack of power interconnection between islands. Imported fossil fuels are by and large the most \nimportant source of energy for Maldives. Fuel imports account for about 10% of the country\u2019s \ngross domestic product (GDP), and approximately half of it is for power generation. The electricity \ngeneration costs are estimated in the range of 0.30\u201370 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh) (depending \non the island) and required government subsidies amounting to $58 million or 1.0% of GDP in \n2019. The heavy diesel dependence of Maldives also makes its carbon emissions per unit of \nelectricity among the highest in the region. \n \n3.  Impacts of coronavirus disease. The unprecedented economic shock caused by the \ncoronavirus  disease  (COVID-19)  pandemic  has  shown  the  vulnerabilities  of  the  country\u2019s \neconomic model. The energy sector has not been spared, with the finances of the utilities \ndetrimentally  affected  by  reduced  demand  from  remunerative  industrial  and  commercial \nconsumers. This, coupled with poor bill collection rates, is expected to create significant cashflow \nshortfalls through first quarter of 2021. The real toll of the pandemic, however, is much higher, \nwith thousands of livelihoods affected by the shutdown of tourism. Though oil prices have reduced \n \n1  The POISED project is one of the largest energy sector intervention in Maldives which aims to introduce renewable \nenergy-based grids in 160 outer islands. The project has already installed solar photovoltaic-battery-diesel hybrid \nsystems  including  energy  management  systems  and  distribution  grid  upgrades  in  70  islands.  Report  and \nRecommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Grant and Administration of Grant to the \nRepublic of Maldives for the Preparing Outer Islands for Sustainable Energy Development Project. \n2 The additional financing for POISED was approved on 29 October 2020,  and will scale up renewable-energy-ready \ngrid systems in additional outer islands, introduce disaster-resilient project components and gender-inclusive \nlivelihood activities, and accelerate the pace of reform initiatives introduced in the current project. \n3  Greater Mal\u00e9 Energy Sector Project aims to introduce liquefied natural gas (LNG) in Greater Mal\u00e9 region for power \ngeneration. One of the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) flagship initiatives is development \nof a liquefied petroleum gas and LNG hub in Sri Lanka. Maldives can take advantage of this by importing LNG cargos \nfrom import terminals in South India or planned LNG terminal in Kerawalapitiya, Sri Lanka. The LNG import, \nregasification and distribution facilities developed in Sri Lanka and Maldives for power generation can help the LNG \nmarket to discover regional prices. The LNG supply sources being considered in South India and Sri Lanka are Kochi \nand Kerawalapitiya with an approximate distance of 400 nautical miles (nm) and 450 nm from Maldives.    \n4  Maldives has 1,192 islands of which 194 islands are inhabited. \n ", "2   \nto historic low values due to the pandemic, the financial difficulties in the energy sector will remain \nas institutions and households struggle to pay their utility bills. The crisis further emphasizes the \nneed to improve the sector\u2019s financial viability by reducing electricity generation costs. \n \n4.  Government\u2019s vision. Maldives\u2019 vision for the energy sector is the provision of sufficient, \nreliable, sustainable, secure, and affordable energy to all citizens. This vision is translated into \nthree pillars: energy efficiency, renewable energy, and integration of technology innovation. The \nMaldives Energy Policy and Strategy 2016 and the Strategic Action Plan (SAP) 2019\u201320235 \nrecognize investing in renewable energy and switching towards cleaner energy sources as vital \nsteps to improve the national energy security. The SAP 2019\u20132023 also has a 2023 target to \nincrease the share of renewable energy mix by 20% compared to 2018 levels, including a \ncommitment to install a minimum of 10 MW of solar photovoltaic under net metering regulations, \nand 30 MWh of energy storage capacity to allow higher penetration of renewable energy. \n \n5.  The low carbon development roadmap for the energy sector of Maldives prepared under \nan ongoing ADB project6 foresees interventions around the three pillars of the energy sector vision \n(para. 4). Renewable energy investments are unarguably the best solutions for outer islands. The \nmain areas considered in future interventions include scaling up of solar photovoltaic penetration \nthrough private sector investments, mobilizing finances for battery storage and grid enhancement \nto create enabling environment for private sector, creating market infrastructure for net metering \nand pilot testing of future potential technologies applicable to Maldives. Limited space hampers \nthe deployment of established low-cost renewable energy technologies such as solar photovoltaic \nin the Greater Mal\u00e9 region. The roadmap has also identified liquefied natural gas (LNG) as a \ncleaner substitute for power generation in the Greater Mal\u00e9 region where large scale deployment \nof renewables for power generation is constrained by space. Hence, the substitution of diesel with \nrenewables and cleaner sources presents an important opportunity for the country to meet \ngrowing energy demand and reduce the corresponding increase in pollution. \n \n6.   ADB\u2019s experience and energy sector priorities. ADB has broad experience in Maldives \nthrough projects which support meeting electricity demand in the capital of Mal\u00e9\u2014such as the \nongoing POISED project and the previously completed  Outer Island Electrification (Sector) \nProject7\u2014 and various technical assistance programs. ADB\u2019s Maldives energy sector operation \nis  increasingly  focusing  its  attention  on  renewable  energy,  energy  efficiency,  and  fuel \ndiversification. These are relatively new areas for the executing and implementing agencies in the \ncountry for which in-house capacity is still lacking.8 The lack of competencies within these \norganizations leads to delay in identifying the appropriate project components, project preparation, \nand approval; low readiness; and delayed benefits to the users. During implementation,9 the \nability to monitor the design aspects of the project is also weak. In addition, these projects to be \nprepared for ADB financing require due diligence, which includes preparing detailed technical \nspecifications, cost\u2013benefit analysis, financial and economic analysis, social and environmental \n \n5  The SAP 2019\u20132023 outlines the developmental targets and priorities of the government for the five-year period. \nGovernment of Maldives. 2019.

Manila. \n8  The Energy Department under the Ministry of Environment (MOE) is the executing agency, and Fenaka Corporation \nLimited (FENAKA) and State Electricity Company Limited (STELCO) are the implementing agencies for energy \nsector projects in Maldives. \n9  Although the ongoing POISED project has been supporting executing and implementing agencies with project \nimplementation, capacity building activities such as workshops on renewable energy, classroom trainings, and \nsupervisory and hands-on training, support is still required in the areas of planning, feasibility studies, design, design \nreview and its verification to ensure development of viable and sustainable projects. \n ", "3 \nsafeguards  and  documentation,  climate  change  assessment  (CCA)  and  climate  risk  and \nvulnerability assessment (CRVA), and procurement documents. \n \n7.  Enhancing and supplementing skills and competencies of the executing and implementing \nagencies are essential to improve project preparation, implementation, and overall portfolio \nperformance. This proposed TA will support government agencies, continue to consolidate the \npositive  actions,  and  build  upon  their  strengths  to  develop  and  implement  energy  sector \ninfrastructure projects from earlier TA resources. This TA supports the priorities of ADB Strategy \n2030,  namely:  (i)  making  cities  more  livable  by  improving  urban  planning  and  financial \nsustainability of utilities; (ii) tackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience and \nenhancing  environmental  sustainability;  (iii)  accelerating  progress  in  gender  equality  by \nincorporating  gender  inclusive  project  components  in  project  design;  (iv)  strengthening \ngovernance and institutional capacity; and (iv) regional cooperation and integration. This TA \nfacility is listed in the current Maldives country operations business plan.10 \n \n8.  The impact of the ongoing and ensuing projects will be supporting sustainable and \nenhanced socio-economic development of the country through: (i) increased renewable and \ncleaner power generation, (ii) improved quality of electricity, (iii) energy security, and (iv) reduced \nfiscal burden as envisaged in SAP 2019\u20132023. These projects are in the energy sector and have \nsimilar due diligence requirements and implementation arrangements. The TA facility approach \nis suitable as it will allow (i) use of common resources to prepare and support projects in the same \nsubsector, thereby enhancing project preparation and implementation efficiency; (ii) executing \nagency  and  implementing  agencies  to  ensure  adoption  of  uniform  approach  and  project \nimplementation arrangements; and (iii) smooth coordination between consultants and project \nteam. Overall, this TA facility will reduce the transaction costs and time by reducing the resources \nrequired of stand-alone transaction TA. \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n9.  Output 1: Survey and assessment to identify optimal liquefied natural gas facility \nand site completed. Activities include survey and analysis to identify the type of LNG facility and \nsuitable site for LNG infrastructure development with support from various experts. Based on the \nsurvey and assessment undertaken, technical report on type and capacity of LNG facility, \ntechnical specifications, engineering estimates, and other relevant details for potential LNG \ninfrastructure will be prepared.  \n \n10.  Output 2: Power system planning, and detailed technical assessment of projects \nenhanced. Activities include basic survey to ascertain the condition of existing network, network \nplanning  to  optimize  the  network  configuration,  and  determine  transmission  expansion \nrequirements based on generation development scenarios and the demand forecast. Based on \nthe network survey planning and simulation exercise, guidelines will be developed for the utility in \nconducting power system planning incorporating load flow and short circuit analysis, switching \nstudies, protection coordination, and other related assessments, to ensure reliability of the power \nsystem. \n \n11.  Output 3: Technical, procurement, financial, environment and social safeguards \nassessments completed. Expertise for conducting due diligence for technical, procurement, \n \n10 ADB. 2019.

The TA facility was formerly named \nas Greater Mal\u00e9 Liquefied Natural Gas Feasibility Study Project in Maldives COBP 2020\u20132022 approved in July \n2019. \n ", "4   \nfinancial,  environment  and  social  safeguards  will  be  provided  to  support  preparation  and \nimplementation of energy sector projects. Activities will include assistance for (i) technical study \nand analysis; (ii) procurement assessment; (iii) financial and economic analysis; (iv) preparing \nsafeguards documents on environmental, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples; and \n(v) designing climate adaptation, mitigation and disaster risk reduction measures. \n \n12.  Output 4: Technical capacity of the executing and implementing agencies improved. \nTechnical  expertise  and  capacity  building  will  be  provided  to  executing  and  implementing \nagencies  with  ongoing  or  ensuing  projects,  to  enhance  overall  energy  investments \nimplementation and sustainability. Support will be provided through consultants, focusing on \nenhancing quality of project design by supporting surveys/studies, project monitoring by assisting \nin supervision, seminars, workshops, and on-the-job training activities benefiting staff of executing \nand implementing agencies of three projects supported under this proposed TA. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA facility is estimated to cost $550,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a \ngrant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-6). The key expenditure items \nare listed in Appendix 1.  \n \n14.  The government agencies responsible for each project will provide counterpart support in \nthe form of counterpart staff, office space, office supplies, project-related information and other \nin-kind contributions. The government was informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB \nto finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  The Ministry of Finance, Government of Maldives will be the executing agency, and the \nMinistry of Environment (MOE) will be the implementing agency of the TA facility. The TA does \nnot require logistical support and undertaking from MOE. TA activities for an ensuing project will \nstart only after ADB approves the project concept paper on the ensuing project.  \n \n16.  ADB  will  administer  the  TA  and  will  be  responsible  for  the  selection,  supervision, \nmonitoring and evaluation of consultants, and payments under the TA. However, this will be \nclosely coordinated with executing and implementing agencies, including consent for recruiting \nthe consultants for project preparation and implementation. The implementation arrangements \nare summarized in Table 1. \n \nTable 1: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation  November 2020\u2013October 2022 \nperiod \nExecuting agency  Ministry of Finance \nImplementing agency  Ministry of Environment \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by IA and ADB \n  ICS (international)  (20 person-months)  $200,000 \n  ICS (national)  (24 person-months)  $60,000 \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2020, as amended from time to \ntime). \n ", "5 \nAspects  Arrangements \nAsset turnover or disposal  The assets purchased under this TA will be handed over to the \narrangement upon TA  Ministry of Environment upon TA completion. \ncompletion \nADB = Asian Development Bank, IA = implementing agency, ICS = individual consultant selection, TA = technical \nassistance.  \nSource:  Asian Development Bank.  \n \n17.  Consulting services. The TA facility will provide an initial 44 person-months of consulting \nservices (20 person-months international and 24 person-months national)11 in the field of LNG \ndesign,  renewable  energy  studies,  power  system  planning,  and  due  diligence  support  for \nprocurement, financial management, financial analysis, economic analysis, environment and \nsocial safeguard assessment, and climate change assessment, and climate risk and vulnerability \nassessment. The TA will also support the required survey, purchase of software and simulation \nrequired for energy sector project preparation and capacity building activities. It is expected that \nthe consultants will be recruited using individual consultant selection method and deployed based \non  the  requirements  during  project  preparation  and  implementation.  ADB  will  engage  the \nconsultants following the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and its \nassociated project administration instructions and/or staff instructions. Except for the survey \nactivities for LNG,12 individual consultant selection is appropriate in this instance because the TA \nfacility involves multiple activities that are not necessarily interdependent and will require a varied \nrange of consultants and services. However, where suitable, recruitment through a firm might be \nconsidered.  \n \nE.  Governance \n \n18.  Since ADB will administer the TA facility, the financial management, procurement capacity, \nand integrity risks during TA facility implementation are assessed to be low. However, thorough \nrisk assessments for procurement, financial management and integrity for ensuing investment \nprojects will be conducted under the TA facility.  \n \nII.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nMaldives for Strengthening Capacity to Design and Implement Energy Sector Projects, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board.  \n \n \n \n11 TA facility savings may be utilized for additional consultant inputs, as may be necessary. \n12 The offshore survey and hydrodynamic study require specialized equipment, and trained equipment operators and \ntechnicians. Hence, it is recommended to engage a firm with experience working in ocean waters to carry out this \nmarine survey assignment. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($\u2019000) \nItem  Amount \nA.
