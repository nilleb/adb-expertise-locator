Reforming  education  to  improve  its  relevance  to  new  political  and  economic \nenvironments has been a priority of the Central Asian republics (CARs) since they gained \nindependence in the early 1990s. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been supporting \nnational reform efforts through major lending and nonlending operations and currently is the \nprincipal development partner for education in the CARs both in terms of policy advice and \namount of investment.  ADB provided technical assistance (TA) for subregional cooperation in \nmanaging education reforms1 to review national education reform processes with a view to \npromoting the exchange of experience between six developing member countries (DMCs): \nAzerbaijan,  Kazakhstan,  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Mongolia,  Tajikistan,  and  Uzbekistan.  The  TA \ninitiated collaboration between ADB and the Open Society Institute (OSI) in education reforms in \nCentral Asia. OSI\u2014through its Soros national foundations\u2014 facilitated field work in three DMCs: \nAzerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Tajikistan. \n \n2.  As  part  of  the  TA  activities,  ADB  sponsored  a  subregional  policy  conference  on \neducation reforms in October 2002 in Bishkek (the Bishkek Conference). The conference \nconvened  key  education  stakeholders  of  the  region,  including  Government  officials, \nnongovernment education partners, and the external funding community. The conference called \nfor further external assistance to strengthen subregional cooperation in education, including an \ninitiative to support the free flows of information, experience, and know-how through networking \namong education stakeholders. Following this conference, ADB and OSI agreed to further their \ncollaboration by supporting a central Asia education cooperation network (CA-ECN). \n \n3.  The OSI has acquired considerable knowledge of local conditions through its Soros \nnational foundations and network programs, and has developed sectoral and thematic expertise \nin education reform management and good governance promotion. Among relevant recent OSI \ninitiatives are a program for civil society\u2019s participation in education policy and the establishment \nof the South-East Europe Education Cooperation Network (SEE-ECN).  \n \n4.  This TA paper was developed by ADB and OSI staff  through a consultation process \ninvolving Soros national foundations and other partners of the Bishkek Conference. It presents \nthe rationale and objectives of a joint ADB-OSI TA to establish and support the CA-ECN.2 The \nTA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n5.  Major Challenges for the Education Systems. The CARs have had to face dramatic \nchanges in their political realities as well as deep socioeconomic struggles during the last 10 \nyears. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, reform efforts in the newly independent republics \nof Central Asia have been hampered by Soviet cultural (e.g., victimization and intolerance), \ninstitutional (e.g., survival of inefficient institutions, lack of information sharing), and economic \n(e.g., centralized states and command economies) legacies. Some pre-Soviet legacies are \ninfluencing societal development (reinforced traditional hierarchical structures in family and \ncommunity).  These  legacies  present  a  major  complex  challenge  for  reforming  education \nsystems in the CARs.  \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2000. Subregional Cooperation in Managing Education Reform. Manila. \n2 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 3 June 2003.  ", "2 \n6.  Education Reform Initiatives.  All of the CARs have been engaged in major education \nreform  initiatives.  Sector  reforms  have  been  characterized  by  such  common  trends  as \ndecentralizing education administration, encouraging a private education sector, shifting part of \nthe  cost  of  education  to  parents  and  communities,  extending  the  duration  of  compulsory \neducation from 10 or 11 to 12 years, modernizing the general education curriculum, rationalizing \nthe network of schools, introducing new generations of textbooks, and supporting child-centered \nand active teaching methods. In higher education, greater autonomy was given to universities, \nmultiple funding sources for education were legalized, and new accreditation mechanisms were \nintroduced. \n \n7.  Lessons  Available.  Currently,  there  are  few  practical  examples  and  comparative \nstudies  that  could  be  used  as  references  when  developing  national  policies.  Educational \nstakeholders are seeking examples from countries that are culturally and politically close to \nthem, but these are not readily available and capacity to produce them is limited. This impedes \nattempts at moving forward with changes. \n \n8.  Decision Making, Politics and Top Down Approaches. Education developments are \noften driven by political agendas rather than based on participatory and informed decision-\nmaking processes. One of the main obstacles to effective education change has been a \ncentralized, top-down approach to education planning and administration, resulting in exclusion \nof major stakeholders from deliberation of education policy. Furthermore, education innovations \nare usually introduced through legislative changes and government regulations and are rarely \nsupported  by  adequate  implementation  mechanisms  (capacity  building  for  education \nadministrators, retraining programs for teachers, etc.).   \n \n9.  Dramatic Decline of Financing. State funding of education has declined considerably \nin all the CARs. In general, no analysis was carried out to determine how to use resources more \neffectively. Policies of financial decentralization and cost privatization have not been successful \nin matching the resource gaps caused by state withdrawal. No substantial changes in school \nfinancing and governance have taken place as a result of such policies; decision-making \nregarding matters of educational content, school organization, allocation of resources, etc. are \nstill centralized. Decentralization and privatization policies have, at least in the short run, often \nled to increasing disparities in the provision and quality of education.  \n \n10.  Inaccessible, Unreliable Information and Data. Information systems are fragmented \nand do not always generate statistics and indicators that are aligned with international practices. \nThe comparability, reliability, and policy relevance of education data is questionable. Efforts to \nimprove the information base tend to be piecemeal, small-scale, and uncoordinated. Analytical \npapers are often  not distributed widely and shared with others who may benefit from the \nknowledge.  \n \n11.  Developing Professional Capacity.  Policy makers, decision makers, and educational \nresearchers lack the capacity to gather and analyze information, formulate policy options, and \nexamine their implications. In part, this is due to the lack of demand from governments for such \ninformation. A new generation of educational professionals is now emerging, bringing policy \nanalysis skills, professional distance from political groups, and/or credibility within the local \ncommunity  to  objectively  analyze  reform  processes  and  effectively  inform  policy-making. \nGreater involvement of the local education professionals and nongovernment organizations \n(NGOs) will strengthen the ownership of new education reform initiatives.    \n ", "    3 \n12.  Coordination of External Assistance. The level of international funding to support \nstability  in  the  region  has  escalated  rapidly  since  11  September  2001.  However,  most \ninternational organizations rely on external rather than internal expertise in identifying their \nfunding  priorities,  which  can  lead  to  duplication  of  assistance,  conflicting  priorities,  or \nmisinterpreted local needs and capacities. A mapping of the work of external agencies would \nhelp to avoid duplication, to capitalize on each other\u2019s strengths, and to fill in the gaps.  \n \n13.  Regional Cooperation for Education Reform. Some cross-border cooperation exists \nbetween the CARs. Sharing of policy information has been promoted through the preparation of \nEducation For All country assessments in the year 2000. ADB-supported TA for Subregional \nCooperation in Managing Education Reform (footnote 1), was a noticeable attempt to enhance \nregional  policy  dialogue  with  the  participation  of  civil  society.  However,  more  effective \ncoordination of reform initiatives, exchanges of experiences, and thorough analysis of overall \neducation reform processes in the CARs are urgently needed. The economic and social benefits \nof  improved  coordination  and  cooperation  can  take  multiple  forms:  harmonized  curricula, \nlegislation, and educational structures can facilitate recognition of diplomas and free flows of \nworkers;  standardized  statistics  and  financial  data  permit  comparability  of  information  and \naccurate analysis for policy-making; and the best practices and conditions for successful policy \nchanges can best be identified from a variety of country experiences. \n \nIII.  THE  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n14.  The objective of the CA-ECN is to  enhance the education reform processes through \nimproved cooperation between the CARs. \n \n15.  The main purpose of the TA is to establish a network of education stakeholders in the \nCARs, interacting primarily through an Internet interface, with a view to sharing information on \neducation  reforms,  including  policy  statements,  project  documents,  legislative  acts  and \nregulations, statistics, analytical reports, research papers, textbooks, methodology guides, data \nbases of experts and consultants, etc. The main expected outputs are  \n \n(i)  an  opening  of  education  reform  processes  to  a  variety  of  stakeholder  groups, \nincluding civil society bodies; \n \n(ii)  the development of the capacity of local education professionals for educational \npolicy research, analysis, comparative analysis, reporting, monitoring, and advocacy; \n \n(iii)  greater awareness among CAR policy makers regarding international experience in \nreforming education; and \n \n(iv)  a  platform  for  discussing  and  initiating  cooperation  and  partnership  between \neducation stakeholders of the CAR.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n16.  Key  TA  activities  will  comprise  (i)  development  of  a  network  of  focal  points \n(knowledgeable  educational  institutions)  beginning  with  Soros  national  foundations  in  the \nparticipating countries, (ii) web site development and maintenance, (iii) constitution of data ", "4 \nbases  and  virtual  libraries,  and  (iv)  information  dissemination  through  networking  of \nstakeholders and the Internet interface.  \n \n17.  Building on Resources and Institutions. The CA-ECN will build on achievements of \nthe  OSI  network  programs  and  Soros  national  foundations\u2019  programs  by  strengthening \ncollaborative links among individuals, groups, and education institutions in the CAR. Rather than \nestablishing a new structure, the initiative will support the development of a regional network of \naffiliated  focal  points  that  will  mainly  be  linked  through  an  Internet  interface  leading \nsubsequently to collaborative projects. Soros national foundations will host and/or support this \nnetwork of focal points, initially in four countries: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, and \nUzbekistan. Focal points will be in charge of the maintenance of the web site, act as centers of \nexpertise  in  education  policy  analysis,  mobilize  national  educational  stakeholders  in  the \nnetwork, and link with each other for the implementation of regional activities. To ensure the \nfinancial sustainability of the initiative, recurrent expenses will be borne by the focal points and \nother network members. Such expenses are modest, consisting principally of communication \ncosts for the Internet interface.  \n \n18.  Information Dissemination. The Internet interface will be the main mechanism for \ncreating  a  regional  education  cooperation  network.  Dialogue  between  organizations  and \nindividuals of the network will take place through the Internet interface. Such dialogue is \nexpected to lead to a variety of cooperation modalities and initiatives: exchange of information, \ndevelopment and translation of materials such as textbooks and teachers guides, professional \ndebates, identification and mobilization of experts, partnership agreements between institutions, \njoint research projects, meetings and conferences, etc. After the establishment of the virtual \nnetwork, physical networking is expected to develop through joint research projects, training, \nmeetings, conferences, etc. The CA-ECN Internet interface will be linked to sites of other \nagencies, including ADB and OSI.  \n \n19.  Development of Regional Professional Expertise. National focal points are expected \nto  federate  and  support  initiatives  of  education  professionals  and  institutions.  They  will \nconstitute venues for training in areas such as research methodology, program evaluation, \npolicy analysis, financial and economic analysis, educational planning, data gathering, analysis \ntechniques,  etc.  Cooperation  with  international  professional  partners,  including  academic \ninstitutions  and  consulting  firms,  will  be  a  preferred  modality  for  capacity  development. \nProfessional partners can provide assistance in analytical work and training, and act as an \ninformational resource.  \n \n20.  Replication Potential. The CA-ECN initiative is an adaptation of the OSI-supported \nSEE-ECN, a broad-based initiative that supports the exchange of information, ideas, and know-\nhow for the reform and quality improvement of education in 11 countries in southeast Europe \n(http://www.see-educoop.net). During the TA implementation period, the extension of the CA-\nECN initiative to other CAR countries will be sought, depending on satisfactory progress and the \nidentification of appropriate focal points in those countries. Further, such initiatives could be \nreplicated in other DMC regions where national education systems share common concerns, \npriorities, and reform challenges (the Mekong, and the Pacific Islands, for instance). \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n21.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $400,000 equivalent for a period of 24 months. \nADB will finance $200,000 equivalent on a grant basis from the Governance Cooperation Fund. \nOSI  will  contribute  approximately  $200,000  both  directly  and  through  the  Soros  national ", "    5 \nfoundations. The TA will mainly support the provision of consulting services, training at the \nregional  level  (study  visits,  bringing  of  experts  from  other  countries  to  Central  Asia,  and \nworkshops), and equipment for web-site development and maintenance. The cost estimates \nand financing plan are provided in Appendix 2. The CA-ECN initiative can be expected to \ngenerate additional external support from other agencies. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n22.  Executing Agencies and Implementation Partners. The TA will be jointly executed by \nADB (Social Sectors Division, East and Central Asia Department) and OSI (Education Support \nProgram).  The  identified  focal  points  in  the  four  countries,  supported  by  Soros  national \nfoundations, will be the principal implementation partners, with the focal point of Kazakhstan \ntaking a lead and coordination role. The four national focal points are presented in Appendix 3.  \n \n23.  Facilitators and Consultants.  A group of country lead facilitators (at least one in each \ncountry) will support the establishment of the CA-ECN. Their main responsibilities will be to \nfacilitate  bringing  in  other  necessary  expertise,  fundraising,  brokering  cooperation  with \ninstitutional partners, and  transferring professional and academic skills. ADB will provide the \nservices of the regional lead facilitator based in Almaty, Kazakhstan, to ensure coordination of \nthe overall initiative and supervise the work of country lead facilitators. If needs arise, ADB may \nuse  the  TA  contingencies  budget  to  engage,  for  certain  periods  of  time,  the  services  of \nsupplementary country lead facilitators. ADB will also provide consulting services related to the \nestablishment and maintenance of the Internet interface, including (i) one Internet interface \ndevelopment consultant in each country; and (ii) the Internet interface development coordinator, \nbased in Almaty, and responsible for establishing the common portal. The focal points will help \nidentify suitable candidates and submit their biodata to ADB. ADB will select and engage the \nservices of qualified domestic consultants, because the skills required are country-specific and \nreadily available domestically at reasonable cost (needs include Russian and local language \nrequirements, frequent interaction with local civil society, knowledge of educational institutions, \nand basic information technology and web site development skills). The consultants will be \nselected in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Outline terms of \nreference of consultants are presented in Appendix 3. ADB will also provide computer hardware \nand software for the Internet interface development. Ownership of equipment will be transferred \nto the focal points at the end of the TA.  \n \n24.  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  from  October  2003  to \nSeptember 2005. ADB and OSI staff will supervise the TA implementation through review \nmissions and quarterly progress reports submitted by focal points and consultants. ADB will \nsupport a midterm review workshop, and final TA evaluation, undertaken jointly by ADB and \nOSI, with a view to determine the appropriateness of continuing support to the CA-ECN. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S  DECISION \n \n25.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $200,000 to be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Governance Cooperation Fund for the ADB-OSI Central Asia Education \nCooperation Network, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK

The proposed Central Asia Education Cooperation Network (CA-ECN) seeks to add \nvalue to cooperation and networking initiatives at the regional, subregional, and country levels.  \nIt will rely heavily on existing institutions and on \u201cvirtual\u201d approaches, i.e., the use of cost-\neffective electronic means of networking, rather than trips and conferences.  Membership in the \nnetwork will be open, assuming some form of Internet access among education communities in \nmost countries of the region.   \n \n2.  In each country, one or several focal points will act as main implementation agents of the \nCA-ECN initiative. The number of identified focal points is expected to expand during the \ntechnical assistance (TA) implementation period. Focal points are knowledgeable education \ninstitutions with (i) experience in conducting education policy analysis projects, (ii) accumulated \ninformation and materials on educational reforms in their countries, (iii) interest in promoting \ncross-border  and  regional  cooperation,  and  (iv)  good  country-level  contacts  and  direct \ncommunication with the whole Open Society Institute (OSI) network.  \n \n3.  The focal point in Almaty will be the central coordinator. It will (i) guarantee coordination \nof regional activities of the focal points, (ii) be responsible for the development of a web-based \nregional resource center, (iii) facilitate the process of collecting key policy documents and other \nrelevant materials from the region and outside of the region, (iv) help broker cooperative \nactivities on issues of common interest among the members of the network, and (v) foster good \nrelations between the network and external funding agencies or other regional or cross-border \ninitiatives.  \n \n4.  National focal points will be responsible for (i) developing and updating their national \nweb  sites;  (ii)  collecting  and  disseminating  information  on  the  web  sites;  (ii)  promoting \nnetworking of education stakeholders at local and national levels; (iii) enhancing networking with \ncounterparts from other countries and coordinating with the lead focal point; (v) promoting \ncross-border and regional cooperation; (vi) identifying themes, topics, and/or activities in which \nthey will take a lead role in the network. The focal points will further define their mandates taking \ninto account their institutional capacities, comparative advantages, and interests.  \n \n5.  The first identified focal points are the following:  \n \n(i)  Kazakhstan.
