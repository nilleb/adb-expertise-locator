The Government of the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh (the Government) requested \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  provide  advisory  technical  assistance  (TA)  for \npreparation of a national policy on involuntary resettlement to strengthen the Government\u2019s \nlegal  framework  for  mitigation  of  development-induced  displacement  and  resettlement  of \naffected persons (APs) caused by acquisition and requisition of land for development projects. \nThe Bangladesh Resident Mission (BRM) fielded a fact-finding mission on 19\u201326 October 2004 \nand reached an understanding with the Government on the objectives, scope, cost estimates, \nfinancing plan, and implementation arrangements for the TA. The TA is included in the BRM\u2019s \ncountry assistance program for 2004.  \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  In Bangladesh, the Acquisition and Requisition of Immovable Property Ordinance II of \n1982  sets  standards  for  payment  of  compensation  for  land  and  other  immovable  assets \nacquired for infrastructure projects. The Ordinance, however, does not deal with the broader \nsocial and economic impacts of land acquisition and resettlement including land replacement or \nland compensation paid at replacement cost; income restoration; relocation assistance and \nallowances; consultation and grievance redressal; assistance to vulnerable groups such as \ninformal settlers/squatters, female-headed households, the elderly, and disabled; and provision \nfor resettlement sites and services. There is no requirement for monitoring and evaluation of \nresettlement once the legally stipulated compensation is disbursed. Thus, land acquisition is \nalways viewed with concern and apprehension by the APs, because it potentially diminishes the \nproductive base of farm families, and because it is always associated with low and delayed \ncompensation payments and often harassment from local revenue officials.1 \n \n3.  The  criteria  used  in  assessing  compensation  entitlement  under  the  Ordinance  are: \n(i) market value of the property on the date of acquisition (based on the registered value of \nsimilar property bought and/or sold in the area in the past 12 months), and (ii) a 50% increase \non such assessed value due to the compulsory nature of land acquisition. The registered value \nof land is, however, only about half of market value because people devalue land in transactions \nto avoid, or pay lower, registration fees. As a result, compensation for land is always less than \nthe market or replacement value of the property. The 1982 Ordinance is not only inadequate for \nthe purposes of resettlement but involves decision making by various levels of administration, \ncausing significant delays in acquisition and project implementation. In sum, resettlement of \nproject-affected  people  is  not  adequately  addressed  in  the  land  acquisition  process  in \nBangladesh. In this context, a national resettlement policy framework to provide adequate \nassistance  to  the  APs,  particularly  nontitled  vulnerable  persons\u2014the  rural  poor,  landless, \nwomen, and other disadvantaged groups\u2014is required. \n \n4.  Official statistics on project-related displacement are rarely available in Bangladesh. \nThrough the 1970s and 1980s, many irrigation, flood control, hydropower, and urban/industrial \ndevelopment projects were completed without any resettlement plan despite foreknowledge of \nlarge-scale land acquisition and population displacement. For instance, the Kaptai Hydroelectric \nDam Project, completed in 1961, displaced a significant large number of families who were not \n                                                 \n1  M. Q. Zaman. 1996. \u201cDevelopment and Displacement in Bangladesh: Toward a Resettlement Policy.\u201d Asian \nSurvey, Vol. 36:7.   \n ", "2  \nadequately rehabilitated.2 In recent years, due to development partners\u2019 policy requirements \nand persistence to mitigate project-induced displacement, some improvements in the form of \n\u201cbest practices\u201d are noticeable in many projects, including those funded by ADB (for example, \nJamuna Multipurpose Bridge Project, Jamuna Bridge Access Roads Project, Jamuna Bridge \nRail Link Project, and Southwest Road Network Project). The best practices include (i) time-\nbound comprehensive resettlement plan for project-affected persons; (ii) entitlement matrix, \nbased on types of losses by the APs; (iii) provision for replacement value of assets (land and \nhousing); (iv) income restoration to a pre-project situation; (v) special attention to women and \nvulnerable  groups;  and  (vi)  civic  amenities  in  resettlement  sites/host  communities  in \nresettlement management. \n \n5.  Notwithstanding  these  project-specific  and  ad-hoc  measures,  findings  from  the  \nEvaluation of Resettlement Experience in Selected Projects3 indicate major problems in land \nacquisition and resettlement management including (i) long delays in payment of compensation \nand resettlement assistance; (ii) lack of adequate consultation with APs at sufficiently early \nstage  to  affect  decision  making  process  and  project  design;  (iii) weak  income  restoration \nprogram; and (iv) weak coordination and monitoring of resettlement activities. ADB\u2019s Special \nEvaluation Study on the Impact of Involuntary Resettlement4 found that the ability to implement \na resettlement plan efficiently and effectively depends both on the clear policy guidelines and \nlegal  framework,  as  well  as  the  knowledge,  skills,  and  experience  of  the  staff  of  project \nimplementation agencies. \n \n6.  To date, the Government has no clearly formulated resettlement policy for persons \naffected  by  development  projects.  As  a  move  to  improving  policy  and  implementation  of \nresettlement, a draft outline of a National Resettlement Policy for Bangladesh was prepared in \n1999 under an ADB-funded regional TA,5 but no follow-up assistance was made due to certain \npolitically sensitive issues at that time. The capacity-building small-scale TA6 for resettlement \nmanagement  training,  completed  in  December  2003,  prepared  further  groundwork  for  a \nresettlement  policy  for  Bangladesh  in  the  form  of  draft  guidelines  for  resettlement  policy \nformulation,  which  were  endorsed  as  the  first  \u201cright step\u201d  by  participants  representing key \ngovernment ministries, departments/agencies, and members of nongovernment organizations \nand  representatives  of  civil  society.  The  draft  guidelines  considered  all  aspects  of  project \nimpacts and contained a set of recommendations for the formulation of a national policy for \ninvoluntary resettlement in Bangladesh. ADB\u2019s lending pipeline for Bangladesh over the next \nseveral years includes projects in the transport, energy and power, water resources and flood \ncontrol, and urban and social infrastructure sectors, which will necessitate land acquisition and \nresettlement. The TA is, therefore, critical for the development of a national policy on involuntary \nresettlement for better management of development-induced displacement and resettlement. \n \n7.  There  is  strong  support  within  the  key  government  departments  and  agencies, \nparticularly the infrastructure agencies such as Roads and Highways Department, Bangladesh \nWater  Development  Board,  Power  Development  Board,  Rural  Electrification  Board,  Local \n                                                 \n2  M.

The training and draft guidelines for policy formulation provided under ADB TA \n4006-BAN:  Enhancing  Capacity  of  Infrastructure  Agencies  in  Management  of  Involuntary \nResettlement  have  generated  great  enthusiasm  in  favor  of  adopting  a  national  policy  on \ninvoluntary resettlement in Bangladesh. The scope of the TA has been discussed jointly in the \nmeetings of the Local Consultative Group (LCG), Transport Subgroup in the country and has \nbeen supported by the development partners, including the World Bank.  \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n8.  The TA will assist the Government in the development of a national policy on involuntary \nresettlement to complement the present Acquisition and Requisition of Immovable Property \nOrdinance II (1982) by addressing the broader issues resulting from loss of land, property, and \nlivelihood. The policy will be developed in accordance with international standards to harmonize \nwith other donor policies and use the ADB policy on involuntary resettlement as a model. It will \nset standards and provide the legal and administrative framework for efficient resettlement \nmanagement  in  implementing  development  projects.  It  will  also  ultimately  strengthen  the \ninstitutional  capacity  of  infrastructure  agencies  in  better  planning  and  management  of \nresettlement activities.  \n \n9.  The TA will (i) analyze the existing legal framework and best practices and disseminate \nthe findings to the Government and stakeholders; (ii) develop the first draft national involuntary \nresettlement  policy  for  Bangladesh;  and  (iii)  prepare  recommendations  and  propose \namendments  to  existing  land  acquisition  laws,  so  that  they  are  harmonized  with  the  draft \nnational involuntary resettlement policy prepared. A TA agreement will be signed between the \nGovernment of Bangladesh (GoB) and ADB before the commencement of the TA. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  Broadly, the main activities under the TA will: (i) review existing policies, legislation on \nland acquisition, and sector policies to identify gaps; (ii) identify likely APs and project impacts \non different groups and communities; (iii) identify relevant mitigative actions and development \napproaches;  (iv) develop mechanisms for including resettlement plans in project preparation; \n(v) develop schemes for compensation and reestablishing livelihoods; (vi) identify possible \nimpacts  on  vulnerable  groups;  (vii)  propose  entitlements,  based  on  potential  losses;  (viii) \ndevelop systems for disclosure of information and consulting with stakeholders; (ix) identify \nprocedures for grievance redressal; (x) assess the institutional capacity of leading infrastructure \nagencies; (xi) review the existing time frame for accomplishing the legal procedures of land \nacquisition, and develop an adequate time frame for this purpose; (xii) explore and recommend \nprocedures for resettlement financing; (xiii) identify monitoring and evaluation systems; and (xiv) \nprovide training on implementation of the policy. Bilateral and multilateral funding agencies will \nalso be consulted during the implementation of the TA. \n \n11.  The TA activities will be carried out by a team of consultants in accordance with a work \nplan to be drawn in consultation with the Ministry of Land (MOL). The overall activities for \ndevelopment of the national policy will be accomplished in two phases. The TA will cover Phase \n ", "4  \nI  activities,  which  will  include  (i)  review  of  the  current  land  acquisition  framework  and \nidentification of gaps for improvement to harmonize with ADB\u2019s involuntary resettlement policy; \n(ii)  evaluation  of  past  resettlement  experience  including  social  dimensions  in  resettlement \noperations, assessment of resettlement implementation and effectiveness of ADB\u2019s and other \ndonor\u2019s resettlement policies in recent projects and lessons learnt based on available reports \nand field level assessments; (iii) conducting sector-specific and national workshops to identify \nboth scope and resettlement needs of various sectors/agencies; (iv) documentation of the \nsector-specific workshops and desk studies highlighting key legal, policy, and institutional issues \nfor policy development in Bangladesh; (v) organizing a study tour to Sri Lanka comprising \nmembers of the relevant ministries, consultant team leader, and representative of ADB to review \nthe Sri Lankan experience in the development of a national involuntary resettlement policy \nfunded by ADB; (vi) preparing a preliminary first draft of the national involuntary resettlement \npolicy; and (vii) conducting a national workshop to review the first draft national involuntary \nresettlement policy. \n \n12.  Subject to satisfactory progress of the TA and to approval by Management of ADB for \nfurther assistance, the remaining activities (Phase II) for development of the national policy will \nbe undertaken under a follow-up ADB TA in 2006 with, primarily, a focus on preparation of a \nfinal draft national policy for involuntary resettlement, as well as implementation guidelines. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $438,000 equivalent, comprising $201,000 of \nforeign  exchange  costs  and  $237,000  equivalent  of  local  currency  costs.  The  TA  will  be \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. ADB will finance $350,000 equivalent \nto meet the entire foreign exchange costs and $149,000 equivalent of local currency costs. The \nGovernment will finance the remaining $88,000 equivalent of the local currency costs, covering \nthe cost for office space for the consultants, counterpart staff, and administrative and logistics \nservices. The detailed cost estimates for the TA are given in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The TA Executing Agency (EA) will be MOL. MOL will provide office accommodation for \nconsultants and provide the necessary secretarial support staff. A joint secretary of MOL will \ncoordinate (as the TA coordinator) the TA activities and provide necessary assistance to the \nconsultants to carry out their work. \n \n15.  A steering committee chaired by the secretary, MOL will be established following the \nfielding  of  the  consultants,  and  will  include  members  representing  the  relevant  ministries \nincluding Economic Relations Division, Ministry of Finance; Implementation, Monitoring, and \nEvaluation Division, Ministry of Planning; Ministry of Land, Planning Commission; Ministry of \nPower,  Energy  and  Mineral  Resources;  Ministry  of  Communications;  Ministry  of  Water \nResources;  and  Ministry  of  Local  Government  and  Rural  Development.  In  addition, \nrepresentative(s)  from  the  legal  profession,  selected  non-government  organizations  with \nresettlement  experience,  and  the  academic  community  will  also  be included.  The  team  of \nconsultants  will  closely  coordinate  with  MOL  and  the  steering  committee  through  regular \nperiodic  meetings  and  participate  in  the  steering  committee  meetings.  Apart  from  regular \nperiodic meetings, the steering committee will also have extended meetings during inception, \npreparation, and final review of the draft policy paper.  \n \n ", "  5\n16.  The TA activities will be carried out over a period of 8 months. A team of consultants will \nprovide  a  total  input  of  29  person-months  (8  international  and  21  domestic)  of  consulting \nservices  for  the  study.  Both  international  and  domestic  consultants  will  have  expertise  in \n(i) resettlement policy formulation and implementation aspects; (ii) institutional analysis and \ncapacity  building  in  resettlement  policy  and  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  resettlement; \n(iii) indigenous peoples\u2019 issues; (iv) gender and resettlement issues; (v) legal issues pertaining \nto land laws and other legislation related to ownership and user rights; and (vi) government \npolicies with regard to housing of the urban poor/informal settlers, urban development, and \nresettlement. The consultants will be recruited by ADB in accordance with the Guidelines on the \nUse  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  for  international  and  domestic  consultants \nacceptable to ADB following the quality- and cost-based selection method with biodata technical \nproposal. Outline terms of reference are attached in Appendix 3. \n \n17.  To  enhance  stakeholder  involvement  representing  the  public,  Government,  private \nsector, non-government organizations, and community-based organizations, the consultants will \norganize consultative workshops at the inception, draft policy (after circulation), and the final \ndocument. The team leader, in consultation with the TA coordinator, will identify workshop \nparticipants. In addition, sector-specific workshops will be held during the preparation. The \nconsultants will conduct field visits to selected project sites to review and ascertain resettlement \nissues and impacts for incorporation into the policy as appropriate. The steering committee and \nthe EA will help the consultants circulate the draft policy paper to all the stakeholders. To ensure \nthe widest possible consultation, the draft policy will be circulated in Bangla and English. \n \n18.  The TA study is expected to commence in May 2005 and be completed by January \n2006. The consultants will submit an inception report 1 month after the start of the TA, a \nprogress  report  at  the  end  of  month  three  and  an  interim  report  at  the  end  of  Phase  I \nincorporating  (i)  review  and  content  analysis  of  the  existing  land  acquisition  and  legal \nframework, (ii) a sector-specific stakeholder report, (iii) detailed documentation of resettlement \nexperience both in development partner and domestically funded projects, and (iv) preparation \nof the preliminary first draft of the national involuntary resettlement policy. \n \n19.  A  tripartite  review  will  be  carried  out  at  inception  and  after  the  circulation  of  the \npreliminary first draft policy report. The report will be revised and finalized by the end of January \n2006. \n \n20.  Several items of office equipment will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s standard \nprocedures of direct procurement using TA funds for use by the consultants, including one each \nof the following: personal computer, printer, fax machine, photocopier, map copier, and other \naccessories as required. These will be handed over to the EA on completion of the TA study. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n21.
