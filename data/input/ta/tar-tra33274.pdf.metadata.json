INTRODUCTION\n1. One of the  cornerstones  of  good governance  is  an  independent, professional,  and\ncompetent system for the administration of justice.  With this in mind, the South Pacific Judicial\nConference (SPJC), comprising senior members of the judiciary from throughout the Pacific\nregion,1 launched the Pacific Judicial Training Project at the SPJC\u2019s 13th biennial meeting held\nin Apia, Samoa, in July 1999.  The Project is a regional approach to capacity building and\ninstitutional strengthening in the area of judicial training and court administration.  The Project\naims to provide a regional resource to promote and build capacity within the region so that\nindividual Pacific jurisdictions can over time establish their own sustainable judicial education,\ntraining,  and  professional  development  programs  for  judicial  service  personnel:  judges,\nmagistrates (including lay magistrates), registrars, and other court staff.\n2. The  regional  resource  center,  which  when  fully  operational  is  expected  to  have  a\nminimum of three internationally recruited  professional staff and two locally recruited support\nstaff, will be based in Suva, the Fiji Islands, at the Institute of Justice and Applied Legal Studies\n(IJALS), which is attached to the University of the South Pacific (USP).  SPJC has requested\ntechnical assistance (TA) to assist with the start-up of the Project and the first three years of the\njudicial training center\u2019s operations.2\nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n3. In  tandem  with  efforts  by  regional  leaders  to  provide  an  enabling  environment  for\nsustainable economic development, SPJC in 1995 resolved to enhance the efficient working of\nthe courts of the region.  As a first step, SPJC commissioned IJALS to conduct a judicial training\nneeds feasibility study.  That decision in essence supported the South Pacific Forum\u2019s regional\naction plan, particularly its call to strengthen the rule of law, improve public accountability, and\npromote good governance.  The then director of IJALS carried out the study in two phases\n(interviews and questionnaire) over a 14-month period.  The study examined the previous,\nexisting, and planned training needs of the judiciary, magistracy, and court administrative staff.\nTheir own identified training needs were recorded.  A total of 14 jurisdictions were surveyed, of\nwhich 11 were Pacific developing member countries (PDMCs).  Among the conclusions drawn\nfrom the results of this study (Grimes Report) are the following:\n(i)  Notwithstanding  that  most  SPJC  member  countries  are  implementing  some\nforms of judicial training initiatives (in many cases using assistance from bilateral\nsources), training has historically proven to be piecemeal in nature and there has\nbeen little evidence of resource and knowledge sharing among SPJC members.\n(ii)  Although valuable courses and training programs have been and continue to be\navailable  across  and  beyond  the  region,  jurisdictions  expressed  a  broad\n                                                       \n1  SPJC, although being the foremost judicial professional entity of the region, has no formal structure or permanent\nsecretariat.  Its members, primarily chief justices, hold biennial meetings to discuss matters of mutual interest.\nCurrent SPJC participating members are drawn from the following countries: American Samoa, Australia, Cook\nIslands, Fiji Islands, Guam, Hawaii, Kiribati, Northern Marianas,  Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia,\nNauru, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, French Polynesia, Samoa, Solomon\nIslands, Tokelau, Tonga, and Vanuatu.\n2  The RETA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in April 1999.", "2\npreference for in-country training delivered by both domestic and international\nconsultants.\n(iii)  The magistracy and court administrative staff require systematic training in both\nlaw and procedure.\n(iv)  Judges, magistrates, and court staff require training in the use of computers in\nrelation to their work.\n(v)  Most jurisdictions request training and assistance with law reporting.\n(vi)  To be successful, any training program must be based on national needs in\nterms of delivery, language, substantive law, procedure, custom, and tradition.\nFrom these and a number of other findings, the Grimes Report concluded that coordination and\nplanning in this area are presently lacking, and that a regionally based coordination point for\njudicial and related education is needed.  It further concluded that it would be cost-effective and\nworthwhile for some of the required training courses to be offered and conducted at the regional\nlevel, whereas other purely national programs \u2014 particularly those involving the training of\ntrainers \u2014 could be formulated in a regional resource center but delivered in-country.\n4. The Grimes Report was used as the basis for SPJC to approach the aid community.\nFirst, however, SPJC set up a subcommittee3  charged  with formulating a  regional  judicial\ntraining project.  In March 1998, at a meeting in the Fiji Islands funded by the United Kingdom\u2019s\nDepartment  for  International  Development  (DFID)  and  organized  by  IJALS,  the  SPJC\nsubcommittee and the representatives of five prospective aid agencies \u2014 Australian Agency for\nInternational Development (AusAid), DFID, New Zealand\u2019s Overseas Development Assistance\nProgram (NZODA), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and Asian Development\nBank  (ADB)  \u2014  met  to  consider  the  findings  of  the  Grimes  Report.    Although  the  report\nadequately highlighted the judicial training needs of Pacific island countries, the aid agencies\nfelt more work was needed to flesh out specific training proposals in more detail, including\ninstitutional and implementation arrangements.  A judicial training expert was subsequently\nengaged for this study using DFID funding.  The expert\u2019s report (the Armytage Report) was the\nsubject of a second round of meetings in Sydney in February 1999.\n5. The outlines of the Pacific Judicial Training Project were agreed upon at the February\n1999  meetings.    UNDP  thereupon  drafted  a  Project  Document  (ProDoc)4  which  it  then\nproceeded to finalize in consultation with SPJC, USP/IJALS, and four other prospective sources\n(AusAID, DFID, NZODA, ADB).  The ProDoc endorses the Armytage Report\u2019s  recommendation\nthat, to be effective, any regional judicial training program must be reasonably long term; the\nProDoc speaks in terms of a project duration of five years.  It also assumes aid  agency\ncontributions of $1,285,000 over the initial stages of the Project, $500,000 of which is to come\nfrom ADB.\n                                                       \n3  The present SPJC subcommittee comprises the Chief Justice of Papua New Guinea (chairman), the Chief Justice\nof the Fiji Islands, the Chief Justice of Samoa, the Chief Justice of the Federated States of Micronesia, an\nAustralian Federal Court Judge, and the President of the Court of Appeal of New Caledonia.\n4  The  ProDoc  is  entitled  \u201cMulti-Donor  Support  Toward  Establishment  of  a  Pacific  Regional  Judicial  Training\nProgramme\u201d.", "3\n6. The ProDoc was signed on 22 June 1999; the signatories were the Chief Justice of\nPapua New Guinea on behalf of SPJC, the Vice-Chancellor of USP on behalf of the project\nexecuting agency, and UNDP\u2019s Resident Representative in the Fiji Islands.\n7. Concurrent with the formulation of the ProDoc, UNDP, with assistance from ADB and the\nother prospective aid agencies, used the services of the United Nations Office for Project\nServices (UNOPS) to advertise internationally for the first project director/program coordinator.\nThe four short-listed candidates for the position were interviewed in Sydney in June.  The\nselection panel comprised the director of IJALS representing USP, two judges nominated by\nSPJC,  and  a  senior  AusAID  officer  representing  all  five  prospective  aid  agencies.    The\nsuccessful candidate5 took up his position in August after participating in the official \u201cdry\u201d launch\nof the Project at the SPJC biennial meeting in Apia in July.\nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.  Objective\n8. The Project aims to establish an ongoing and comprehensive process of education,\ntraining, and professional development for judicial service personnel in the developing island\nnations of the Pacific, including Papua New Guinea.  It should lead to the enhanced competence\nof Pacific judicial service personnel in terms of knowledge of law, proficiency in judicial skills, and\ndevelopment of appropriate attitudes and  values.   The overall development  objective  is  to\nstrengthen the rule of law in the Pacific region through more efficient and effective administration\nof justice.  The TA logical framework is in Appendix 1.\nB.  Scope\n9. The Armytage Report identified nine outputs on which the Project will focus:\n(i)  Faculty development.  Develop within the region and in each country a local\ncapacity  to  plan,  conduct,  and  manage  a  program  of  continuing  judicial\neducation, training, and development.\n(ii)  Mentor program.  Develop and conduct a mentor scheme to provide \u201coff-the-\nbench\u201d practical help and support for new judicial appointees.\n(iii)  Regional workshops.  Provide a regular mechanism to develop on a continual\nbasis the professional skills and attitudes of all judicial service personnel.\n(iv)  National  conferences.    Provide  a  regular  mechanism  to  keep  the  judiciary\ninformed on recent developments in law and practice, address current technical\nand professional issues, and exchange professional experience.\n(v)  Regional orientation program.  Induct new appointees to judicial office.\n                                                       \n5  The position of project director has been awarded to a UK-trained lawyer, Mr. Kim Stanford-Smith, who was Chief\nMagistrate and Registrar of the High Court and Court of Appeal in Solomon Islands in 1983-1990 and has since\nworked extensively in the Pacific region, most recently as the Director/Resource Trainer (Judicial) for a DFID-\nfinanced Pacific region human rights education resource team.", "4\n(vi)  National seminars and workshops.  Provide a continuing mechanism of national\nseminars and specific workshops for the judiciary on particular areas of training\nidentified as being of special importance to them.\n(vii)  Bench books.  Produce practical court manuals on common and difficult aspects\nof law and court practice for use by judges and magistrates on a day-to-day\nbasis, and revise existing services.\n(viii)  Bulletin.   Publish  written  materials  to  keep  the  judiciary  informed  on  recent\ndevelopments and current issues in justice, law, and practice.\n(ix)  Extension learning packages.  Develop, conduct, and support the delivery of\nlocal  continuing  judicial  training  through  extension  and  distance  learning\npackages.\n10. The focus countries for the Project will be all 12 PDMCs: Cook Islands, Fiji Islands,\nKiribati, Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, Papua New Guinea, Samoa,\nSolomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu, together with Niue, Palau, and Tokelau.  ADB\nfunding under the Project will be restricted to activities in or on behalf of the PDMCs.\n11. Since his appointment in August, the Project Director has notified all jurisdictions of the\ncommencement of the Project.  National coordinators (NCs) have been identified (in most cases\na  senior  judge  or  court  registrar),  and  in  most  jurisdictions  a  National  Judicial  Education\nCommittee (NJEC) comprising 3-6 senior members of the legal community has already been\nformed.\n12. The Project Director has also personally visited a number of PDMCs to consult with the\nNCs and NJECs and jointly identify the immediate national training needs  within the  nine\nactivities of the program as they apply to each jurisdiction.  From that, a tentative work program\nfor the first 12 months was developed.  During this start-up period, the Project Director has also\nestablished contact with other judicial education programs \u2014 in particular, those offered by the\nAustralian Institute of Judicial Administration, the New Zealand Institute of Judicial Studies, and\nthe  Commonwealth Judicial  Education  Institute.    Full  cooperation  with  the  Pacific  Judicial\nTraining Project has been promised in every case.\n13. The two imperatives of the work program as it was being developed were that it must\naddress capacity building and produce training activities and material.  Its guiding principles\nhave been (i) judicial ownership, (ii) bench specificity, (iii) national focus and decentralized\ndelivery,  (iv)  capacity building,  (v)  sustainability  of  incremental  medium-term  change,    (vi)\nresource  utilization  and  coordination,  (vii)  bottom-up  priority,  (viii)  consolidation  of  judicial\nidentity, and (ix) investment in future technologies.\n14. Through the emphasis on bottom-up priority \u2014 i.e. an emphasis on the training of\nmagistrates  (lay,  quasi-qualified,  qualified)  ahead  of  the  training  of  senior  judges  \u2014  the\ndevelopment of appropriate attitudes and values is expected ultimately to bring the court and\njustice systems within the  reach  of  a  wider  range  of citizens, particularly  women,  than  is\npresently the case.  The work plan is expected to start in the first quarter of 2000 with a regional\n(Fiji Islands/Solomon Islands/Vanuatu) orientation program for magistrates and an intensive (10-\n14 days) program for 20-25 NCs.", "5\nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n15. The Armytage Report formulated a budget of $1,285,000 for the start-up phase of the\nProject.   AusAID,  DFID,  NZODA, and  UNDP have  expressed  their  intention  to  contribute\nbetween them $785,000, and ADB has agreed in principle to finance $500,000.  The funds will\nbe secured for at least the first 18 months through cost-sharing agreements  between  the\nindividual aid agencies and UNDP.  The agreements with AusAid and DFID are already in place\nand those with NZODA and ADB are in the final stages of negotiation.  The TA will be financed\nby ADB, on a grant basis, from the ADB-funded TA program, and for this initial period (Phase I)\nwill be for $350,000 rather than the $500,000 envisaged under the ProDoc.  Detailed, although\nstill tentative, cost estimates and the financing plan are presented in Appendix 2.\nD.  Implementation Arrangements\n16. The University of the South Pacific will be the Executing Agency and will implement the\nProject through its Institute of Justice and Applied Legal Studies.  IJALS was established in\n1995 primarily  to  provide six-month practical  training  courses  for  USP  law  students  upon\ngraduation from USP\u2019s Law School at Port Vila.  Part of  IJALS\u2019s brief  is  also  to  support\ncontinuing legal education for the legal profession generally, including members of the judiciary\nand their staff.\n17. IJALS earlier this year moved into well-equipped modern premises on USP\u2019s lower\ncampus in Suva.  Two existing buildings on the site are in the final stages of being renovated to\nhouse this judicial training project; one will be used for offices and the other, for training rooms.\nAny judicial personnel brought to Suva for regional seminars or conferences under the Project\nwill be able to make use of the excellent accommodation, catering, and communication facilities\nthat are now part of the IJALS complex.\n18. Implementation of the Project will also be guided by a project steering committee (PSC),\nwhich is expected to meet twice yearly and to receive quarterly reports from the Project Director.\nSir Arnold Amet, Chief Justice of Papua New Guinea, chairs the PSC and Sir Timoci Tuivagi,\nChief Justice of the Fiji Islands acts as cochair.  Other members of the PSC are representatives\nof the five aid agencies (AusAID, UNDP, DFID, NZODA, and ADB) and representatives of USP\nand IJALS.  The PSC\u2019s first meeting following the official launch of the Project took place in\nearly December, at which time the tentative program of activities for the Project\u2019s first 12 months\nas proposed by the Project Director was formally approved.  The implementation time frame of\nthe Project as contemplated under the Armytage Report is expected to be about five years with\nUSP as the Executing Agency for  the  whole  period.    TA  support from  ADB, however,  is\nexpected to terminate after approximately three years, i.e., by March 2003.  ADB has already\nindicated that toward the end of that period,  it will consider a Phase II TA of up to $150,000 to\nmeet the full target of $500,000 referred to earlier.\nIV. THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n19. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the\nprovision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of\n$350,000 for the purpose of the Pacific Judicial Training Project, and hereby reports such action\nto the Board.", "6\nAppendix 1, page 1\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT FRAMEWORK\nDesign Summary Targets/Measurable Monitoring Assumptions\nIndicators Mechanisms and Risks\nGOAL\nEnhanced competence of \u2022 Better vocationally \u2022 Reduction in complaints, Continuing confidence in the\nPacific judicial service trained judicial officers e.g., to Judicial Service justice system and respect for\npersonnel in terms of Commissions the rule of law\nknowledge of law, proficiency\nin judicial skills, and \u2022 Reduction in appeals \u2022 Judicial reviews and\ndevelopment of appropriate and review judgments annual reports\nattitudes and values.\n\u2022 Increased effectiveness \u2022 Court statistics\nof courts (fewer delays)\n\u2022 Reduction in remand \u2022 Court statistics\nperiods\n\u2022 Reduction in case \u2022 Field tests\nbacklogs (hearings and\nreserved judgments)\nPURPOSE\nProvide Pacific developing \u2022 The South Pacific \u2022 SPJC education SPJC-SC finds mechanism to\nmember countries (PDMCs) Judicial Conference subcommittee (SPJC- enable meetings so policy and\nwith a regional resource to (SPJC) through its SC) takes lead role in program can be formulated and\npromote, assist, and build education subcommittee judicial education in the implemented.\ncapacity to establish their own has capacity to Pacific.\nongoing, sustainable and coordinate,  and ability The United Nations Development\ncomprehensive judicial to secure funding and \u2022 The Project office is Programme (UNDP) and the\neducation, training, and draw upon a faculty of established, judicial University of the South Pacific\nprofessional development judicial educators from education programs and (USP) will work out simplified\nprograms for judicial its member countries material are designed, and effective financial\npersonnel within each Pacific where logistically it is delivered, and management of the Project for\njurisdiction. advantageous to disseminated. handover to USP.\naddress training needs\nthrough a regional USP will deliver facilities and\njudicial education manage Project effectively.\nprogram.\nSuitable staff are employed and\n\u2022 Established ongoing and design and deliver appropriate\ncomprehensive process \u2022 National judicial courses and material.\nof judicial education, education committees,\ntraining, and national coordinators, Jurisdictions support the\nprofessional and judicial training SPJC-SC and \u201cbuy into\u201d the\ndevelopment for judicial officers attend training. training program.\nservice personnel within\ncountries through their \u2022 National training courses\nnational judicial are designed and\neducation committees delivered.\n(NJECs).\n(Reference in text: page 3, para. 8)", "7\nAppendix 1, page 2\nDesign Summary Targets/Measurable Monitoring Assumptions\nIndicators Mechanisms and Risks\n\u2022 Established core of \u2022 Regional training Jurisdictions appoint and supprt\ncourses are designed effective and capable NJECs\nmodel programs and\nmaterial, which PDMC and delivered. and national coordinators (NCs)\nthat can access recurrent funding\njurisdictions can draw\nupon through the \u2022 Training material is to run national training programs\ntraining center. produced. in medium and long term.\nOUTPUTS\nA.
