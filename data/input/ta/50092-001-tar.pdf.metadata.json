Independent  evaluation  at  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  aims  at  raising  the \ndevelopment  impacts  of  ADB  operations.  This  proposed  cluster  regional  research  and \ndevelopment technical assistance (TA) will support high- and mid-level studies and outreach \nactivities in the work program for 2016\u20132018 of the Independent Evaluation Department (IED), \nand its subsequent ADB Board of Directors-approved rolling work programs.1 The work program \nfor 2016\u20132018 was endorsed by ADB\u2019s Development Effectiveness Committee (DEC) and later \napproved on a no-objection basis by the Board on 9 December 2015.2 Evaluation studies and \noutreach  activities  for  funding  by  the  TA  seek  to  improve  ADB  policies,  strategies,  and \noperations\u2014subsequently benefiting ADB\u2019s developing member countries.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  In the coming decades, countries in Asia will confront major challenges such as (i) \nmaking their economies resilient to shocks from economic crises, social tensions, and natural \nhazards; (ii) tackling climate change and environmental degradation; (iii) sustaining inclusive \ngrowth to prevent inequality from hurting growth and poverty reduction; and (iv) seeking private \nsector  solutions  to  boost  the  sustainability  of  results  and  bring  innovation.  Given  the \ntransboundary dimensions of such development challenges, solutions are needed on many \nfronts and will require a multidisciplinary understanding of the causes and effects of the issues \ninvolved. \n \n3.  ADB\u2019s operating landscape is also changing. Future strategic directions need to reflect \nthe  emergence  of  new  development  finance  institutions,  the  approval  of  the  Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals, and the new Climate Change Agreement. As more members transition to \nmiddle-income countries, ADB needs to reflect the most appropriate approach to address their \nneeds. It must meet these new challenges and make valuable and timely contributions. ADB is \nnow developing a new corporate strategy, Strategy 2030. \n \n4.  IED\u2019s high- and mid-level evaluations complement project-level evaluations and give a \nstrategic perspective to ADB operations and directions in Asia and the Pacific. IED can identify \neffective  approaches  to  addressing  development  challenges  through  its  evaluations.  Such \napproaches will be fed back to operations for project designs to address the development \nchallenges in a better manner. \n  \n5.  In 2016, IED is undertaking evaluations that will provide recommendations on ADB\u2019s \nStrategy  2030,  engagement  with  middle-income  countries, 4  and  partnerships. 5  This  is \ncomplemented by topical papers on environmentally sustainable growth (ESG)6 and private \n                                                \n1  The TA cluster first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 23 May 2016. \n2 This is driven by several key considerations: (i) providing timely inputs to formulating future ADB policies, \nstrategies, and programs; (ii) providing real-time feedback during loan processing and implementation; (iii) building \nevaluation capacity, both within and outside ADB; and (iv) producing strategically relevant knowledge on emerging \nregional development issues to inform ADB operations and development policies in member countries. \n3  Evaluations include thematic, corporate, real-time, and impact evaluation studies; evaluation knowledge studies; \nand country and regional evaluations.

In  response  to \ndevelopment partners\u2019 requests, IED will conduct a study on policy-based lending. \n \n6.  IED will continue to align with ADB\u2019s operational priorities. It will take on key studies to \nstrengthen  private  sector  work  over  the  next  3  years\u2014credit  enhancement,  private  sector \noperations, and risk management. IED will also evaluate ADB\u2019s experience with safeguards \nthrough case studies in 2016. In 2017 and 2018, it will generate impact evaluations on projects \nin the water resource management and education sectors, conduct an evaluation study on ESG, \nand complete the studies on ADF operations (ADF 12) and the piloting of results-based lending. \n \n7.  In the past, IED prepared regular TA on an annual basis to support studies and activities \nin its 3-year rolling work program. Priorities for independent evaluation, as reflected in the work \nprogram, are updated yearly to be consistent with the emerging development issues faced by \nADB in its strategic directions and operations. Often, this would need scope changes to keep \nthe TA updated to meet changing work programs. This made the process cumbersome and \ntime-consuming from an administrative point of view. The shift to a TA cluster approach to \nsupport this and subsequent rolling work programs is appropriate. It seeks to streamline the \napproval process while offering flexibility and close quality control, i.e., subprojects can be \ndesigned and outputs and activities determined just before their implementation. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The impact will be improved development effectiveness of ADB operations, policies, \nstrategies, and business processes. The outcome will be increased use of evaluation studies by \nthe ADB Board of Directors and its DEC, ADB Management and operations staff, and country \nagencies and stakeholders (Appendix 1). \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n1.  Cluster Technical Assistance \n \n9.  The TA cluster comprises three subprojects that enable the preparation of IED high- and \nmid-level evaluation studies and conduct outreach activities. The pipeline is drawn from IED\u2019s \nyearly Board-approved work programs. Each program is developed as a 3-year compilation of \ntasks, which when taken together addresses, on a rolling basis, ADB\u2019s involvement in Asia and \nthe Pacific. The outputs of the TA cluster are (i) evaluation studies, knowledge briefs, and other \nevaluation  products  completed;  (ii)  knowledge-sharing  and  learning  events  satisfactorily \nconducted; (iii) evaluation outreach products and services and derivative products from learning \nevents disseminated; and (iv) information system for managing and disseminating evaluation \nknowledge  improved.  Lessons  and  recommendations  from  TA-funded  evaluations  will  be \ninputted into IED\u2019s evaluation information systems, i.e., lessons database and management \naction records system. \n \n10.  During  the  formulation  and  implementation  of  studies  and  activities,  IED  teams \nconcerned will hold consultations with various institutions in government and civil society. These \n                                                \n7  IED. 2016. Topical Paper: A Comparative Institutional Review of Private Sector Operations. Manila: ADB. \n ", "  3 \nconsultations may be determined at the concept or evaluation approach paper (EAP) stage. \nWhere  appropriate,  draft  reports  will  be  sent  to  government  and  other  stakeholders  for \nfeedback. \n \n11.  Prior to starting an evaluation, an EAP will be prepared, providing its rationale, objective \nand scope, methods to be used, resource requirements, terms of reference for consultants, and \ndissemination plan. A concept paper may be prepared when (i) diagnostic work is needed prior \nto finalizing an EAP, or (ii) a country sector assessment is more conveniently done ahead of a \ncountry assistance program evaluation (CAPE). Consultant recruitment may begin when either \na draft EAP or concept paper is approved by IED\u2019s director general for interdepartmental review. \nEach evaluation study will have internal and external peer reviewers. Completed studies are \ncirculated to the Board and Management and normally discussed by the DEC. \n \n2.  Learning and Accountability from Independent Evaluations and Validations \n \n12.  Subproject 1 will focus on evaluations for delivery in 2017, and will be based on the \ncurrent IED work program for 2016\u20132018.8 These studies will commence in the second half of \n2016. Supplementary Appendix A gives a tentative list of evaluation studies for financing by \nsubproject. Subproject 1 will support about seven high-level and five mid-level evaluations. The \nhigh-level evaluations are (i) thematic and/or corporate evaluations on gender, policy-based \nlending, private sector operations, sustainability of energy sector operations, small and medium-\nsized enterprises; (ii) an impact evaluation (water resource management); and (iii) a CAPE on \nGeorgia. Mid-level evaluations include a topical paper on livable cities and validations of the \ncountry  partnership  strategy  final  reviews  for  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Nepal,  Thailand,  and \nTurkmenistan. Supplementary Appendix B describes select thematic and corporate evaluations \nfor financing by Subproject 1. \n \n13.  Subproject  2  will  be  structured  along  the  same  line,  and  focuses  on  delivering \nevaluations for 2018. This will depend on the Board-approved work program for 2017\u20132019.9 \nThese evaluations will start in the second half of 2017. Indicatively, it will fund about seven high-\nlevel and five mid-level evaluations. Based on the current work program, high-level evaluations \nto be supported are (i) thematic and/or corporate evaluations on ESG, rural development, ADF \n12 operations (including the disaster response facility), risk management, and results-based \nlending  pilot;  (ii)  an  impact  evaluation  (education  project);  and  (iii)  a  CAPE  (as  will  be \ndetermined  by  the  2017\u20132019  work  program).  Mid-level  evaluations  include  validations  of \ncountry partnership strategy final reviews for Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bhutan, Cambodia, and Fiji \n(Supplementary Appendix A). \n \n14.  Similarly structured, subproject 3 will focus on evaluations for delivery in 2019. It will \ndepend on the Board-approved work program for 2018\u20132020.10 It will support evaluations that \nwill commence in the second half of 2018. Tentatively, it is also expected to fund about seven \nhigh- and five mid-level evaluations. Based on ADB priorities and subsequent discussions with \nthe DEC during the preparation of the 2016\u20132018 work program, the indicative pipeline beyond \n2018 includes studies on agriculture and food security operations, health operations, education \n                                                \n8  Studies supported by the subproject will also be adjusted through a change in scope in the subproject memo \nshould the subsequent 2017\u20132019 work program warrant it. IED will start consultations with the DEC, ADB \nManagement, and heads of departments on the upcoming 2017\u20132019 work program in July 2016. Where needed, \nsubprojects 1\u20133 can support preparatory and/or advance work on evaluations in the out-years of the work \nprograms. \n9  Scope changes in the subproject memo can be made depending on the work program for 2018\u20132020. \n10 Scope changes in the subproject memo can be made depending on the work program for 2019\u20132021. \n ", "4 \n \noperations, urban operations, water operations, public\u2013private partnerships, climate adaptation, \nintegrated disaster risk management operations, information and communication technology for \ndevelopment, safeguard policy statement review, project monitoring and evaluation, use of the \nmultitranche financing facility, private equity operations, and inclusive business (Supplementary \nAppendix A). \n \n3.  Evaluation Outreach, Knowledge Sharing, and Partnerships \n15.  Independent  evaluation  becomes  meaningful  only  when  its  findings,  lessons,  and \nrecommendations are shared and used to improve ADB development results. For subprojects \n1\u22123, TA cluster components on knowledge-sharing and outreach activities will cover, among \nothers: (i) continuing use of IED information and technology for dissemination (website and \nsocial media), (ii) periodic learning events to inform both ADB staff and external stakeholders, \n(iii) continuing preparation and sharing of summary knowledge products like learning lessons \nand  learning  curves,  and  (iv)  periodic  maintenance  and/or  enhancements  to  the  lessons \ndatabase and management action record system. Supplementary Appendix C gives further \ndetails on evaluation outreach activities. The 2015 Knowledge-Sharing and Outreach Report of \nIED gives an overview of knowledge sharing and outreach during the year.11 \n \n16.  Further to knowledge sharing and outreach, the TA cluster will also support cooperation \nwith a range of development partners (with operations in Asia and the Pacific) at the institutional \n(i.e., bilateral, multilateral, and regional organizations and institutions) and operational and/or \ncountry levels (i.e., academe, civil society, evaluation associations, and government). \n \n17.  Several risks have been identified in implementing the TA (Appendix 1). Unexpected \nshifts in strategic and policy directions occurring in ADB and in countries in Asia and Pacific can \naffect the TA outcome. The delivery and quality of IED evaluations will also depend on the \navailability and quality of data. Since IED\u2019s dissemination activity is largely online, success can \nbe dependent on the internet connectivity of users. IED will look at ways to mitigate these risks. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost $7,500,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF)\u2212other sources. Subproject 1 for $2,500,000 \nwill be financed by TASF\u2212other sources. Subprojects 2 and 3 will have the same TA size \nfinanced by the TASF\u2019s annual resource allocation to IED in the subsequent years (Appendix 2). \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA. IED will implement the TA and supervise \nall  planned  studies  and/or  knowledge-sharing  and  outreach  activities.  The  TA  cluster  will \nsupport the (i) engagement of sector and thematic specialists and researchers to help conduct \nin-depth analysis and/or give expert inputs on the development context and challenges during \nreport preparation, i.e., data collection, surveys and processing, quantitative and qualitative \nanalyses,  background  analytical  papers,  and  main  report  preparation;  (ii)  engagement  of \nexternal experts for independent peer reviews; and (iii) engagement of resource persons to \nspeak and/or coordinators to help organize key evaluation outreach and knowledge-sharing \nactivities (Supplementary Appendix D). \n \n                                                \n11 IED. 2015. Knowledge Sharing and Outreach Report. Manila: ADB. \n ", "  5 \n20.  These  will  require  the  services  of  about  155  international  consultants  (about \n300 person-months) and 230 national consultants (about 540 person-months) from 2016 up to \n2019. The outline terms of reference for indicative consulting requirements are in Appendix 3. \nFull details of consulting services (i.e., positions, expertise, duration, terms of reference and \ndeliverables, and cost estimates) will be determined at the concept or EAP stage of a study or \nactivity. \n \n21.  ADB will engage consultants (either on an individual or resource person arrangement) in \naccordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). \nLump-sum or output-based contracts will be used as appropriate.12 Use of a consulting firm or \nentity (along with the selection method and type of technical proposal) will be assessed at the \nconcept  or  EAP  stage.  Purchase  of  equipment  and  services  for  conducting  conferences, \nseminars,  and/or  workshops;  and  surveys  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time), and will be in coordination with \nthe  Controllers\u2019  Department, Office  of  Information  Systems  and Technology,  and Office of \nAdministrative Services, where applicable. After the TA is completed, any procured equipment \nwill  be  disposed  of  in compliance  with  Administering  Grant-Financed Technical  Assistance \nProjects in the Project Administration Instructions.13 \n \n22.  TA disbursements will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). Progress on key evaluation milestones will be \ntracked through mission back-to-office reports and ad hoc presentations or consultations on \nevaluation findings. The TA outputs will be disseminated in accordance with IED\u2019s evaluation \npolicy,  particularly  on  public  disclosure,  dissemination,  and  lessons.  Implementation \narrangements will be flexible to accommodate alterations in IED\u2019s work program. \n \n23.  A mix of small and large teams, led by IED staff, will be used based on the complexity of \nthe  work. The  deployment  of staff  may  cut  across evaluation  divisions,  depending  on  the \nexpertise  required.  Each  team  is  responsible  for  formulating  the  study  or  activity. \nImplementation oversight (e.g., adequacy of staff, consultant processing, and management), \naccountability  for  outputs,  and  communication  with  stakeholders  will  be  delegated  to  the \nevaluation team leader of a study or activity concerned. \n \n24.  The  TA  and  its  subprojects  are  expected  to  be  implemented  from  July  2016  to \nDecember 2020. Indicatively, a subproject will have a 2.5-year implementation period. ADB will \nobtain a no objection from the government before starting any activity financed under this TA in \nthe territory of that country. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S RECOMMENDATION \n25.  The President recommends that the Board approve the provision of technical assistance \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $7,500,000 on a grant basis for Selected Evaluation Studies \nand Outreach for 2017\u20132019. \n                                                \n12 Where appropriate, these contracts will encourage job technical transfer opportunities or expert interactions with \ngovernment counterpart staff. If an assignment requires specific timing for expert fielding or field time, these will be \nclarified in the terms of reference. Variations to lump sum contracts will be on a case-to-case basis, with exceptions \nconsidered only when the added terms of reference clarify distinct outputs for additional payments. \n13 ADB. 2013.

Knowledge Program \n \n1.  The  program  comprises  high-level  evaluations  such  as  corporate  and  thematic \nevaluations and impact evaluations; and mid-level evaluations such as knowledge studies and \ntopical papers. Other evaluative research and outreach products include knowledge briefs, \njournal articles, books, and brochures and flyers. The mix of evaluation products for subprojects \n1\u20133 of this technical assistance (TA) cluster will be based on the yearly work programs (2016\u2013\n2018) endorsed by the Development Effectiveness Committee and approved on a no-objection \nbasis by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Board of Directors. The nature or scope of work of \neach product is briefly described below. \n \n(i)  Corporate and thematic evaluations. Focus on thematic issues across sectors \nor countries or evaluate an ADB policy or business process. \n(ii)  Impact evaluations. Use quasi-experimental designs and emphasize the validity \nand reliability of evaluation results. \n(iii)  Evaluation knowledge studies. Offer forward-looking insights and prospective \napplication of lessons on major crosscutting themes. \n(iv)  Topical  papers.  Focus  on  current  development  issues  to  share  ideas  or \ntechnical working papers related to evaluation reports. \n(v)  Knowledge  briefs.  Synthesize  evaluation  findings,  lessons,  and \nrecommendations for a broader range of clients (i.e., drawn from evaluation and \ncompletion reports and literature reviews). \n(vi)  Other evaluative research and outreach materials. Prepare books and journal \narticles on operationally relevant topics, and other awareness-raising matters like \nbrochures and flyers. \n \n2.  Independent  evaluations  will  generally  involve  mixed  methods  and  be  informed  by \ndocumentation analysis, key informant interviews, pilot economic analysis, and site inspections. \nEach evaluation team will be supported by a mix of international and national consultants. \nIndicatively, a total of 108 international consultants (about 226 person-months) and180 national \nconsultants  (about  432  person-months)  will  be  mobilized.  This  is  a  rough  estimate  of  the \nrequirements during the implementation of subprojects 1\u20133. The number, type, expertise, and \nduration of assignment will vary depending on the sector and/or theme topic and complexity of \nthe study. The need for consultant inputs will be determined at the concept paper and/or \nevaluation approach paper (EAP) stage.  \n \n3.  International  consultants.  Sector  and  theme  specialists  with  relevant  academic, \nprofessional, work experience, and evaluation expertise will be mainly engaged on individual \nassignments. Consultant inputs will normally be 1\u20133 person-months per assignment. Taking into \naccount  the  scope  of  work  (e.g.,  stakeholder  survey,  focus  group  discussions,  and  key \ninformant  interviews)  and  inputs  involved,  a  consulting  firm  may  be  engaged  during  the \npreparation of the concept paper and/or EAP. \n \n4.  Evaluators and/or advisors. The specialists will use secondary, project and survey \ndata, and in-depth interviews to assess the implementation of relevant ADB strategy, policies, \nand operations. They will (i) review ADB project documents; (ii) join an evaluation mission to \nvalidate  the  impacts  of  ADB  implementation  through  site  visits,  and  interview  relevant \ngovernment ministries and local communities (about their experiences on specific projects); (iii) \nhelp organize sample surveys of stakeholders, evaluate performance by carrying out a portfolio \n     ", "Appendix 3  11 \nanalysis,  investigate  specific  projects for  best practices  and  those  with  key  lessons to  be \nlearned through country case studies; (iv) assess experiences from other multilateral agencies; \nand (v) prepare assigned sections of the evaluations. \n \n5.  For  impact  evaluations,  the  scope  of  work  will  involve  (i)  a  literature  review,  (ii) \nsecondary data analysis and identification of counterfactual results for the analyses, (iii) primary \ndata  collection  (usually  a  large  questionnaire  survey),  and  (iv)  data  analyses  and  report \npreparation.  The  evaluation  will  build  on  data  collected  during  project  implementation  and \nidentify and/or analyze comparison groups or counterfactual results based on questionnaires, \nkey informant interviews, and secondary data. The evaluation team will require, as deemed \nnecessary,  a  sector  and/or  thematic  expert  and  an  econometrician.  Both  will  have  strong \nquantitative  and  qualitative  evaluation  skills,  and  proven  experience  in  (i)  evaluation \nmethodologies; and (ii) conducting impact evaluation using both qualitative and quantitative \nmethods through sample surveys, statistical and econometric tools, focus group discussions, \nand key informant interviews. They will have prior experience in conducting rigorous impact \nevaluation. \n \n6.  For the assessment of nonsovereign operations, private sector consultants will (i) review \nADB\u2019s  private  sector  operations  strategies,  instruments,  portfolio  trends,  organization,  and \nprocesses; (ii) assess individual private sector operations transactions through document review, \nfield visits, and interviews with project sponsors, financiers, and relevant ADB staff; (iii) compare \nADB\u2019s operations with comparable multilateral financial institutions; and (iv) based on findings \nunder (i\u2013iii), advise what changes are necessary to enhance ADB\u2019s value addition. Consultant \ninputs will be about 2 person-months per assignment. \n \n7.  For topical working papers, the consultant(s)-cum-advisor (about 3 person-months per \nassignment), with a high level of expertise and strong multilateral experience, will help prepare \nshort papers with a strong evaluative angle, connecting past lessons to current and prospective \nsituations. They will draw lessons from evaluations (from ADB and other development partners) \non topics of high operational relevance. \n \n8.   Resource persons-cum-external reviewers. They will (i) comment on the draft report, \nfocusing on areas that need strengthening; and (ii) give guidance on articulating key findings, \nlessons, and recommendations. Each study will have about two peer reviewers, with each \nassignment involving a maximum of 10 working days.1 \n \n9.  National consultants. The need for national consultants will be assessed at the EAP \nstage.2 Like international consultants, the number, mix, type, expertise, work experience, inputs, \nand duration of assignment will vary depending on the topic and complexity of the study. \nConsultant inputs will be at least 1 person-month for in-country assignments and about 2\u20134 \nperson-months for work carried out at headquarters. \n \n10.  In-country  consultants.  The  consultants  will  (i)  prepare  country  reports,  initially \nfocusing on relevant ADB implementation experience, and current practice in the country as well \n                                                \n1  For resource persons, passports will be used to verify an expert\u2019s nationality or member country eligibility. United \nNations documents such as the laissez-passer are not acceptable. Resource persons from nonmember countries \ncan be financed by the TA after waiver of membership eligibility in consultation with ADB\u2019s Office of the General \nCounsel. \n2  National consultants may take a regional task to assist international experts if the task does not account for a \nsubstantial part of their terms of reference. If the TA envisages international travel by a national expert, these \nrequirements must be added to their terms of reference. \n ", "12  Appendix 3 \n \nas that of other development partners; (ii) support evaluation mission field work, in particular \nfacilitating logistics; (iii) arrange and conduct structured interviews with key informants; and (iv) \nsupport  survey  or  questionnaire  and  data  analysis.  They  are  expected  to  have  a  sound \nunderstanding of development issues at the country level, ADB policies and operations, and \ndevelopment partners. \n \n11.  Headquarters-based. Philippines national consultants (research analysts, statisticians, \nand/or  econometricians)  will  support  data  collection  and  analytical  work.  These  include \n(i) literature reviews, policy, and program analysis; (ii) review of project and other documents; \n(iii) portfolio  analyses,  benchmarking  analyses,  and  preparation  of  country  case  studies; \n(iv) secondary data collection; (v) managing surveys and/or questionnaires and related data \nanalyses; and (vi) other statistical support and/or econometric analyses. \n \n12.  For nonsovereign operations, private sector experts will be engaged to (i) provide advice \non  the  national  environment,  and  national  project  finance  and  financial  market  conditions; \n(ii) arrange and conduct structured interviews with key informants; and (iii) facilitate logistical \narrangements. \n \nB.  Learning and Accountability from Independent Evaluations and Validations \n(Country Program Operations) \n \n13.  Country assistance evaluations provide ADB and its developing member countries with a \nbasis  for  determining  future  country  partnership  strategies  (CPSs).  Depending  on  country \nrequirements, sector and/or thematic assessments are undertaken to give inputs to the main \ncountry  assistance  program  evaluation  (CAPE). 3  As  indicatively  programmed,  country \nevaluations and validations will require about 40 international consultants (about 72 person-\nmonths) and 36 national consultants (about 90 person-months) during 2016\u20132019. \n \n14.  International  consultants.  The preparation of  CAPEs and validations of CPS final \nreviews will require at least 22 evaluators (1\u20133 person-months each based on complexity).4 \nSpecific tasks will include, among others: (i) review ADB assistance programs and assess their \nrelevance, effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability, and impacts on strategic sector objectives; \n(ii) do key informant interviews, conduct surveys on the outcome and impact of ADB assistance, \nand  discuss  sector  development  issues  and  concerns  with  executing  agencies  and  other \nstakeholders; and (iii) help assess the validity of ADB\u2019s sector development strategies in the \nstudy country. In addition, at least 18 resource persons or advisor-cum-external reviewers will \n(i) comment  on  the  draft  report,  focusing  on  areas  that  need  strengthening;  and  (ii)  give \nguidance on articulating key findings, lessons, and recommendations (footnote 1). \n \n15.  National consultants. At least 36 in-country and headquarters-based experts will be \nrequired to support the evaluation teams (at least 1 person-month for in-country assignments \nand about 2\u20134 person-months for work carried out at headquarters based on complexity). In-\ncountry  evaluation  consultants  with  previous  exposure  to  development  issues  (sector  and \nthematic) in the study country will be recruited to (i) present an overview of the relevance and \nimplementation of ADB sector strategies; (ii) assess and rate the achievement of project and \nprogram objectives, and the delivery of core sector, crosscutting, and thematic programs; (iii) \n                                                \n3  Estimates of consultant inputs are tentative and will be reviewed during discussions of the concept paper or EAP. \n4  If the work program of the Independent Evaluation Department (IED) does not include a CAPE for a country where \na new CPS is to be prepared, IED will validate a CPS final review. The CPS final review validation report then \nserves as the equivalent of a CAPE as an input to CPS preparation. \n ", "Appendix 3  13 \ncomment on ADB\u2019s institutional positioning and performance in a sector; (iv) organize and \nfacilitate focus group discussions, workshops, and meetings; and (v) define important issues \nand lessons in a sector\u2019s operations. \n \n16.  Philippines- and/or headquarters-based national consultants will comprise evaluation \nresearchers and coordinators. Evaluators-cum-researchers will provide analytical support during \ndata collection and analyses. These include (i) desk reviews of project and other relevant \ndocuments, internet searches, and other literature reviews; (ii) statistical and other technical \nsupport such as portfolio reviews, policy and program analyses, benchmarking, and statistical \nand/or econometric analyses; and (iii) preparation of country case studies. Evaluators-cum-\ncoordinators will (i) carry out quality assurance reviews on validated project and/or program \ncompletion reports and extended annual review reports, and/or (ii) help the project or program \nreview report focal or group leader supervise and administer the validation process. \n \nC.  Evaluation Outreach, Knowledge Sharing, and Partnerships \n \n17.  Other  evaluative  research  and  outreach  products  include  knowledge  briefs,  journal \narticles, books, and brochures and flyers. Specific services from consultants and resource \npersons will also support (i) management of information systems and technology (6 person-\nmonths for two Philippines- or headquarters-based consultants; (ii) derivative communication \nand outreach products (4 person-months for three headquarters-based consultants); and (iii) \nknowledge sharing, i.e., contributions during international events or forums, consultations with \ndeveloping member countries, and interactive learning event(s). As indicatively programmed, \nevaluation outreach will require about 7 international consultants (about 2 person-months) and \n14 national consultants (about 18 person-months). \n \n18.  The  TA  will  also  support  cooperation  with  a  range  of  development  partners  (with \noperations in Asia and the Pacific) at the institutional level (i.e., bilateral, multilateral, and \nregional organizations and institutions) and operational and/or country level (i.e., academe, civil \nsociety,  evaluation  associations,  and  government).  Within  the  Independent  Evaluation \nDepartment\u2019s  yearly  outreach  program,  these  involve  participation  in  (resource  person)  or \ncontributions to (sponsorship or cooperation agreements) international evaluation events and \nactivities (e.g., conferences, training workshops, and joint evaluations) that focus on priority \nevaluation  issues,  promote  learning,  coordinate  or  harmonize  evaluation  practice,  and \nstrengthen evaluation capacity.  \n \n19.  Specific  requirements  for  interactive  learning  events  include  (i)  in-country  event \nmanagement-cum-partnership coordinators (3 person-months for two national coordinators); \n(ii) Philippines-  and/or  headquarters-based  event-cum-partnership  coordinators  (5  person-\nmonths for two national coordinators); (iii) panelists (1.4 person-months for six international \nexperts); and (iv) a moderator (0.25 person-month for an international expert). \n \n "], "metadata": {"Author": "ADB", "CreationDate": "D:20160729105752+08'00'", "Creator": "Microsoft\u00ae Word 2010", "Keywords": "adb technical assistance ta report", "ModDate": "D:20160810183842+08'00'", "Producer": "Microsoft\u00ae Word 2010", "Title": "Technical Assistance Report"}}
