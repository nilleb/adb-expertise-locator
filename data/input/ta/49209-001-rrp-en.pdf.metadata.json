THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed policy-\nbased loan to India for the Second West Bengal Development Finance Program. The report also \ndescribes the proposed technical assistance (TA) for  Supporting the Second West Bengal \nDevelopment Finance Program, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the \nauthority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA.1  \n \n2.  The proposed program seeks to facilitate the continuation of a comprehensive fiscal \nconsolidation program in West Bengal initiated in 2012. This will generate fiscal savings and, \nthereby, assist West Bengal to augment growth-enhancing development financing and improve \ndelivery of public services.  \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The need to develop a comprehensive program that addresses fiscal consolidation and \ndevelopment for the Government of West Bengal (GOWB) has been on the agenda of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) since 2005 when the preparatory stage of a policy-based loan was first \ninitiated.2 This acquired renewed focus in 2011 when the state introduced a series of reforms with \nthe change in state administration. Since then, ADB and GOWB have been in constant policy \ndialogue to develop a durable reform and developmental agenda starting with the preparatory \nstage of the first policy-based loan in 2012.3 \n \n4.  In view of the GOWB\u2019s fiscally-stressed situation, ADB approved a policy-based loan of \n$400.0 million and a TA grant of $0.7 million to India in 2012 for the first West Bengal Development \nFinance Program (the first program). The key contributory factors to the fiscal stress were the \nstate\u2019s low own-tax revenue4 effort and a high level of non-discretionary expenditure (salaries, \ninterest  payments,  and  pensions),  which  adversely  affected  GOWB\u2019s  ability  to  pursue  its \ndevelopment financing objective.5 This provided the rationale to the first program, which aimed to \ncreate the fiscal space to augment and sustain higher development spending (public investment) \nin the state.  \n \n5.  Given the difficulties of rationalizing public expenditure over 2\u20123 years, ADB and GOWB \nagreed that the first program would facilitate the necessary steps to augment revenue and lay the \nfoundations for improved targeting of scarce public resources to improve the overall efficiency of \n                                                \n1  The proposed program is a continuation of the West Bengal Development Finance Program (the first program). A \nfollow-on program was envisaged in the original design of the first program. \n2  West Bengal is a densely populated state, fourth largest in India, with a population of 91 million people and \nstrategically located in eastern India bordering Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal.  \n3  ADB. 2012. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors for Proposed Policy-Based Loan \nand Technical Assistance Grant to India for West Bengal Development Finance Program. Manila (Loan 2926-IND, \napproved on 30 October 2012). \n4  The state\u2019s revenue receipts comprise (i) own revenues, which include those tax and non-tax revenues that fall within \nthe jurisdiction of the Government of West Bengal (GOWB), and (ii) transfers from the Government of India in the \nform of grants and share in central government\u2019s taxes and duties. \n5  These have had an adverse impact both in terms of (i) preventing effective use of the budget as an instrument to set \npolicy priorities particularly through discretionary spending; and more importantly, (ii) constraining both public and \nindirectly private investments, thus undermining economic growth and development in the state. These have also \nhad serious implications for manufacturing growth in the state leading to a narrowing of the commercial tax base. \n \n ", "2 \nspending. The GOWB achieved full compliance on all policy actions under the first program, and \nhas moved beyond the goals of the first program.6 Independent assessments recognized the \nGOWB\u2019s commitment to fiscal consolidation, and the GOWB received several awards for e-\ngovernance in tax administration in 2014.7 \n \n6.  Policy actions in the first program clearly enhanced the revenue performance of GOWB in \na broad-based manner, and improved the state\u2019s finances (Table 1). Public investment (as a \npercentage of gross state domestic product [GSDP]), reached almost 1.3% in FY2016 from 0.5% \nin FY2012, although the fiscal deficit reduced to 2.2% in FY2016 from 3.4% in FY2012. This was \none of the major contributions of the first program. \n \nTable 1: Key Fiscal Parameters \n(% of gross state domestic product unless stated otherwise) \nItem  FY2010  FY2012  FY2015  FY2016  \nFiscal deficit  6.3  3.4  3.4  2.2 \nRevenue deficit  5.4  2.8  2.1  1.0 \nCapital outlay  0.8  0.5  1.2  1.3 \nDebt stock  42.0  39.3  34.7  32.6 \nCost of revenue collection as a  2.43  1.64  1.03  \u2026 \n   percentage of revenue  \nOwn-tax revenue  4.2  4.7  4.9  4.5 \n(\u2026) = not available, FY = fiscal year. \nSource: Government of West Bengal, Finance Accounts, FY2010\u2013FY2016.  \n \n7.  The first program was an example of successful partnership between the GOWB (and the \nGovernment of India) and ADB. It critically hinged on the political commitment of GOWB to bring \nabout necessary fiscal reforms, so that it can set the fiscal objectives on a balanced and \nsustainable path geared toward meeting the state\u2019s long-term development financing needs. \n \n8.  It was recognized in the original design of the first program that the full effect of the reforms \non improvements of public service delivery would need a period of 5 years to materialize, and that \nthe  GOWB  will  require  additional  support  under  a  follow-on  program.8 Additional  external \nassistance is required to sustain the reform momentum because of the following reasons: \n \n(i)  Some of the reforms already initiated, by their very nature, have a long-term \nimplementation cycle. The foundations of these reforms were laid under the first \nprogram but they now need to be carried forward. These reforms include linking \nthe  medium-term  expenditure  frameworks  (MTEFs),  initiated  under  the  first \n                                                \n6  The PCR rating for the first program was successful. The TA was rated highly successful. ADB. 2015. Project \nCompletion Report for West Bengal Development Finance Program. Manila. \n7  In recognition of the success of many e-governance initiatives, the GOWB\u2019s Directorate of Commercial Taxes \nreceived the FY2015 Government of India\u2019s National Award for excellence in government process re-engineering. \nSimilarly,  the  Finance  Department  received  FY2014  CSI-Nihilent  e-governance  awards  for  (i)  promotion  of \ninformation management in administration of commercial taxes, and (ii) workflow-based file and letter tracking \nsystem. Furthermore, the Excise Department received the 2014 Skotch digital inclusion award for the e-Abgari \nsystem, which introduced an online tax filing system in the state excise administration that also helps track production, \ndistribution, and sale of liquor. Finally, the Finance Department received an award from the Chief Minister on the \noccasion of the 68th Independence Day of India on 15 August 2014 for the outstanding contribution to citizen-friendly \ntax reforms and e-governance. In recognition of the improvements in finance and tax-related compliances, GOWB \nwas recognized by the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion under the Ministry of Commerce and Industries, \nGovernment of India in May 2014 report on improving business environment across India. \n8  The GOWB requested a second program in a letter to the Department of Economic Affairs dated 29 October 2014. \nIt considers a second program necessary to further consolidate its finances and step-up financing of infrastructure, \nsocial welfare, and development programs, which are important prerequisites for improved service delivery.  \n ", "3 \nprogram, with actual budget allocations; payments for the voluntary retirement \nscheme (VRS) and/or early retirement scheme (ERS) in selected state-owned \nenterprises  (SOEs)  to  ensure  effective  implementation  of  the  subsidy \nrationalization strategy; and digitizing legacy data on registered property deeds in \nall registration offices in the state. A continued assistance for such reforms through \nthe proposed second program would consolidate and sustain gains made towards \nbetter own-revenue management and expenditure rationalization. \n \n(ii)  The first program focused on augmenting public investment. However, creating an \nenabling environment for facilitating private investment, especially in the areas of \nsocial and economic infrastructures, is equally important in the context of growth \nand public service delivery. Thus, the second program envisages supporting \nprivate investments more directly. This is intended to be achieved by creating an \ninfrastructure  facility  for  supporting  project  preparation,  development,  and \nappraisal activities as well as for viability gap funding (VGF).9 \n \n(iii)  The follow-on  reforms will  have  major  cost  implications,  such  as  linking the \nmedium-term expenditure frameworks (MTEFs) with actual budget allocations; \npayments for the voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) and/or early retirement \nscheme (ERS) in selected state-owned enterprises (SOEs), settlement of liabilities \nof two SOEs, and VGF for PPP projects. If GOWB has to incur the entire cost of \nreforms, then this could undermine GOWB\u2019s regular budgetary allocations for \npublic investment (enhanced under the first program). \n \n9.  An integrated solution comprising a policy-based loan with clear program costs supported \nby the attached TA is the appropriate lending approach and modality. This will help ADB and \nGOWB to design and implement additional policy actions to carry forward GOWB\u2019s own reform \nagenda without putting unsustainable strain on the public exchequer to finance reforms costs. \nThe second program will support key elements of the state\u2019s agenda including making the tax \nadministration more efficient and transparent through simplification of rules and e-governance, \nenhancing outlays for capital creation, and improving the business environment for micro, small \nand medium enterprises.10 \n \n10.  ADB\u2019s India country partnership strategy for 2018\u2013202211 aims to support the Government \nof India\u2019s goal of higher, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth with its emphasis on three \npillars,  viz.  (i)  boosting  competitiveness  to  create  better  jobs;  (ii)  inclusive  provision  of \ninfrastructure and services, comprising public sector management among other thrust areas; and \n(iii) addressing climate change and increase climate resilience. The strategy declares that ADB \nwill extend assistance to improve the efficiency of public sector resource management at state, \nlocal body, sector (including public sector undertaking), and project level. The first area of \nemphasis in public sector management includes ADB\u2019s support towards fiscal space creation and \nsound fiscal discipline at state and urban local bodies levels, through fiscal consolidation and \nimproved capacity of public financial management. Support may include budgetary reforms with \n                                                \n9  Viability gap funding (VGF) is a grant that is provided as capital subsidy to attract private participation in those public-\nprivate partnership (PPP) projects that have economic justification but may not be financially viable without that grant. \n10 Government of West Bengal, Finance Department. 2017.

A key lesson learned from the first program, which also provides the rationale for the \nproposed second program, is that sustained political commitment and strong ownership of \nreforms in the state is the most important prerequisite for a successful policy-based loan. Another \nimportant  lesson  is  that  ownership  is  guaranteed  through  long-term  association  with  the \ndevelopment partner(s) and continuation of the key implementation staff. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The impact will be improved accessibility, quality, and affordability of public services.12 \nThe outcome will be improved and sustained investment in the state, particularly in the social and \neconomic sectors.13 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n13.  The three output areas under the second program will be:14 \n \n(i)  Expenditure rationalization efforts accelerated. To consolidate reforms initiated \nunder the first program, the second program will include (a) VRS and/or ERS for \nselect SOEs, including state transport corporations and Shalimar Works Limited \n(as part of continued implementation of the action plan on subsidy rationalization \nprepared under the first program);15 (b) settlement of liabilities for restructuring of \ninoperative  or  loss-making  SOEs; 16  (c)  linking  MTEFs  (health  and  school \neducation) initiated under the first program to the actual budget allocations for \nFY2019;17 (d) implementing the remaining three modules of the integrated financial \nmanagement  system;18 and  (e)  strengthening  internal  audit  in  the  Finance \nDepartment.  \n                                                \n12 Government of West Bengal, Department of Planning. 2013. Annual Plan 2013\u20122014. Kolkata. \n13 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n14 There are 25 policy actions under the second program, of which 11 are in the first tranche. The GOWB has already \ncomplied with the policy actions in the first tranche, which is expected to be released in October 2017. The balance \n14 second tranche actions are expected to be completed within 22 months of the release of the first tranche, or by \nAugust 2019. \n15 State transport corporations include Calcutta State Transport Corporation, Calcutta Tramways Company, South \nBengal State Transport Corporation, North Bengal State Transport Corporation, and Shalimar Works Limited. \n16 These include National Iron and Steel Company Limited and Neo Pipes and Tubes Company Limited. \n17 An MTEF requires policymakers to look across sectors, programs, and projects to examine how public spending can \nbest serve national development objectives over the medium term. In doing so, they must weigh the importance \nattached to short-term goals against the attached to medium-term objectives and set aside the narrow self-interests \nof spending agencies. MTEFs can promote fiscal discipline by addressing several causes of deficit bias. By specifying \nan overall resource constraint, MTEFs rein in the political tendency to overcommit public resources (the common \npool problem) by requiring policymakers to acknowledge that the total amount of resources is limited, to negotiate \ncollectively, and to commit themselves to detailed multiyear fiscal constraints. Further, by imparting a medium-term \nperspective to budgeting and taking into account the future fiscal costs of government policies and programs, an \nMTEF can fill information gaps that allow politicians to renege on their commitments to implement affordable policies. \nA few studies suggest that fiscal discipline is stronger in many countries after adoption of MTEFs. World Bank. 2013. \nBeyond the Annual Budget: Global Experience with Medium-Term Expenditure Frameworks. Washington, D.C). \n18 Four out of the seven modules have been implemented under the first program viz.drawing and disbursement \nmodule, computerization of salary accounts (COSA) software, the budget-treasury interface (e-allotment) module, \nand the government revenue receipt portal system. The three remaining modules are e-pradan, e-centralized \ntreasury system, and centralized budget monitoring system. \n \n ", "5 \n \n(ii)  Facilitation  of  private  investment  improved.  The  state\u2019s  public\u2012private \npartnership (PPP) policy was developed under the first program. To catalyze \nprivate investments in the state further, it is proposed that the GOWB sets up the \nWest  Bengal  Investment  and  Infrastructure  Development  Fund  (WBIIDF)  to \nfacilitate PPPs through VGF, with emphasis on health and education projects.19 In \naddition, the GOWB will set up a centralized single window portal for statutory \ncompliance requirements for micro, small, and medium enterprises to support ease \nof doing business. \n \n(iii)  Revenue administration strengthened. Activities proposed under the program \nare broadly in continuation of the reform agenda initiated under the first program. \nThese include: (a) improved tax monitoring by the Directorate of Commercial \nTaxes; (b) completion of preparatory steps for integration with the goods and \nservices  tax  network; 20(c)  continued  support  to  information  technology  (IT) \nsystems in strengthening administration of the Excise Directorate; (d) continued \nsupport to IT systems in strengthening administration of the Land and Land \nReforms Department, and the Directorate of Registration and Stamp Revenue to \ncomplete the digitization of legacy deed data in both departments, and enable \nsimultaneous mutation of land records on the registration of a property; and (e) \nimproved service delivery for taxpayers by setting up facilitation centers in the \nselected registration offices.  \n \n14.  The objective of the second program is to help the GOWB sustain a fiscal profile that \nensures elevated public investment in the state without breaching the key fiscal targets. Higher \ninvestment in economic and social infrastructure, combined with policies to promote private \ninvestment, will remain an important prerequisite for sustaining high growth and employment. \nWithout high growth, especially manufacturing growth, GOWB\u2019s own revenue will not grow in \nadequate measure to support the state\u2019s development financing needs. Once public finances are \nplaced on a sustainable path, the GOWB will also be in a strong position to provide affordable \npublic services, leading to a discernible positive impact on the livelihoods of the people of West \nBengal.  \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n \n15.  A development financing gap has been estimated based on discussions with GOWB about \n(i) additional development financing needs, (ii) the current fiscal profile of the state, and (iii) a \nsustainable fiscal consolidation road map for 5 years (FY2018\u2012FY2022) to carry forward fiscal \nconsolidation efforts initiated under the first program. At a macro level, the proposed second \nprogram  will  help  the  state  to  augment  and  sustain  development  financing.  Development \nexpenditure (capital outlays) as a percentage of gross state domestic product (GSDP) is expected \nto rise from 1.3% in FY2016 to 1.5% and 1.7% in FY2018 and FY2019, respectively, so as to \neventually reach 2.2% by FY2022 under the program. The policy reforms under the program will \nlead to improved revenue generation and contain growth of total expenditure leading to improved \nfiscal outcome under a reform scenario. The reforms will generate additional revenue equivalent \nto $1.9 billion over the program period directly through revenue administration reforms, and \n                                                \n19 This will be in line with the Government of India\u2019s policy for VGF. \n20 Goods and services tax is a comprehensive, multi-stage, destination-based single indirect tax that will be levied on \nevery value addition and subsumes within it 5 taxes at the central level and 6 taxes at the state level. Other levies \nwhich were applicable on inter-state transportation of goods have also been done away with in GST regime. It has \nbeen implemented with effect from 1 July 2017. \n ", "6 \nindirectly through revenue buoyancy impact of increased growth-enhancing investments. The \nsecond program will thereby contribute towards sustainability while increasing development \nspending in a sustained manner. However, there is a development financing gap (additional \ncapital outlays plus additional current expenditure under the ADB-supported reform program net \nof new fiscal space created under the program) of $431.3 million over the program period. ADB\u2019s \nassistance will help cover 69.6% of the gap (Appendix 5).21  \n \n16.  Based on the development financing requirements of the policy reform program, the \nGovernment of India has requested a regular loan in the amount of $300 million equivalent from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in regular terms, to help finance the program. Two tranches in \nthe amount of $150 million equivalent each are envisaged, with the first tranche disbursed upon \nloan effectiveness, and the second tranche approximately 22 months after the first tranche. \n \n17.  At the request of the Government of India,22 ADB will provide the Government of India with \nan option to request disbursement in Indian rupees (INR) for either or both of the tranches under \nthe second program.23 In effect, withdrawals under either or both of the tranches may be made in \nINR or United States Dollar (USD), on terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and program \nagreements. The local currency financing option is at the discretion of the Government of India\u2015it \ncan choose not to exercise it. At the same time, ADB has provided this option to the Government \nof India on a best efforts basis. If the market condition is not conducive and ADB is unable to raise \nINR in full, the disbursement for that tranche will be, in part or in full, as applicable, in USD. \n \n18.  The USD portion of the loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years, \nan annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms \nand conditions as set forth in the draft loan and program agreements. Based on the straight-line \nmethod, the average loan maturity is 10.39 years, and there is no maturity premium payable to \nADB. The Government of India will relend to GOWB the local currency generated from the \nproceeds of the total loan amount in USD in accordance with its arrangement for transfer of \nexternal assistance to the GOWB. The tenor and grace period of the INR portion of the loan will \nmatch that of the USD loan, and have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years. The \nterms and conditions of any disbursement in INR will be specified in the INR pricing notice, \nprovided to the GOWB in response to its withdrawal request for disbursement in INR.24  \n \n19.  The Government of India has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow \nin local currency and USD under LIBOR-based lending facilities based on the above terms and \nconditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices are its own independent decision and not \nmade in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n                                                \n21 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n22 This request was followed by the Government of India\u2019s relaxation of its regulatory requirements, facilitating ADB to \nraise INR funding.

The drawdown amount in INR would be computed \nusing the ADB foreign exchange book rate (https://forex.adb.org/fx_rate/) on the date of receipt by ADB of the INR \nwithdrawal request.  \n24 Government of India can request for indicative cost any time before the disbursement date and it will submit a formal \nirrevocable withdrawal request at least 20 days prior to the requested disbursement date. \n ", "7 \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  The Finance Department of GOWB will continue to be the executing agency of the second \nprogram, and the Principal Secretary of the Finance Department will be the focal point for matters \npertaining to the program.  \n \n21.  The Fiscal Policy and Management Unit (FPMU), set up during implementation of the first \nprogram, will assist the line departments implementing the program. It will be headed by a senior \nGOWB official as the program director. The FPMU will be responsible for: \n \n(i)  overall coordination and monitoring of the program, including the policy actions; \n(ii)  preparing and submitting all required reports to ADB;  \n(iii)  submitting the quarterly reports to ADB; and \n(iv)  helping to implement the attached TA. \n \n22.  Procurement,  advance  contracting,  and  retroactive  financing  are  not  expected.  The \nprogram will be implemented over 2 years. The proceeds of the loan will be disbursed in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s simplification of disbursement procedures and related requirements for \npolicy-based loans.25 ADB will monitor program implementation through periodic progress reports \nand will field regular missions to confirm fulfillment of policy actions for tranche release. \n \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n23.  The attached TA will strengthen the key institutions responsible for implementing reforms \nto improve fiscal management performance in the state. The TA components are: \n \n(i)  Revenue administration strengthened. The TA will support the GOWB in (i) \nimplementation of the goods and services tax; (ii) implementation of supply chain \nmanagement system in excise, and (iii) strengthening of the property registration \nsystem. \n(ii)  Project appraisal and monitoring capacity strengthened. The TA will train and \nassist FPMU in project appraisal and monitoring. \n(iii)  Medium-term expenditure frameworks developed. Support will be provided to \nupdate the MTEFs prepared under the first program and link the updated MTEFs \nwith actual budget allocations for FY2019. \n(iv)  West  Bengal  Investment  and  Infrastructure  Development  Fund \noperationalized. Technical support will support and build capacity of the FPMU \nstaff to select, structure, and develop the PPP projects that will be provided viability \ngap funding  under the WBIIDF. \n(v)  Internal  audit  strengthened. The TA  will  help  strengthen the  internal  audit \ndepartment within the Finance Department, including introduction of a risk-based \naudit manual. \n \n24.  The TA is estimated to cost $600,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-Others). The GOWB will provide counterpart \nsupport in the form of counterpart staff remuneration, office accommodation and supplies, local \ntransport, other logistical support, and other in-kind contributions. \n \n25.  The implementation arrangements for the TA will be aligned with those of the policy-based \n                                                \n25  ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila. \n ", "8 \nloan. The FPMU will implement the TA components, and the Finance Department will carry out \noverall  supervision  and  coordination.  A  total  of  28  person-months  of  consultancy  services \n(national) will be required intermittently. The consulting firm will be engaged for recruiting the \nnational consultants using the quality and cost-based selection method with a standard quality \ncost ratio of 90:10. All consultants will be recruited in line with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time). All disbursements under the TA will be made \nin accordance with ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended \nfrom time to time). \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n \n26.  Several outputs of the program have technical components at their core. The information \nand communication technology-driven initiatives such as QR-code based holograms for liquor \nbottles and SMS-based detection facility for liquor bottles will continue to boost compliance of \nvarious state taxes. Integration with the goods and services tax network will remain a major \nchallenge. Preparation, selection, and monitoring of PPP projects to be funded under the WBIIDF \nwill require strong financial and project management skills. Updating the MTEFs and linking them \nwith actual budget allocations will require sound technical knowledge. Capacity building support \nunder the program will assist the relevant government departments to manage these technical \noperations better. \n \nB.  Economic \n \n27.  The program was subject to economic analysis, the results of which demonstrate that its \nbenefits considerably outweigh the costs. The key direct benefits considered are (i) reduced \ncompliance costs in revenue administration (due to e-filing of tax returns, for example, and other \nIT-based taxpayer services) leading to higher tax buoyancy; (ii) fiscal savings from greater \nefficiency and cessation of systemic leakages; and (iii) targeted public expenditure on health and \neducation over the medium to long run. A comparison between the baseline and the pro-growth \nreform program scenarios shows that the overall fiscal deficit is expected to remain around the \ntarget figure of 3% of GSDP despite higher capital outlays (development financing) under the \nreform scenario (Table 2). Fiscal space created under the program, resulting both from revenue \naugmentation and expenditure rationalization, will contribute to this outcome. Moreover, the debt \nstock\u2013GSDP ratio will decline from 33.71% in FY2017 to 30.01% in FY2022 under the reform \nscenario (footnote 21). \n \nTable 2: Baseline and Reform Scenarios  \n(% of gross state domestic product) \nItem  FY2018  FY2019  FY2020  FY2021  FY2022 \nBaseline Scenario           \nFiscal surplus or deficit  (2.95)  (2.90)  (2.85)  (2.85)  (2.85) \nCapital outlays  1.45   1.50   1.60   1.70   2.05 \nDebt stock  32.86   32.05   31.29   30.62   30.02  \nReform Scenario           \nFiscal surplus or deficit  (2.93)  (3.07)  (2.89)  (2.88)  (2.82) \nCapital outlays   1.50   1.70   1.80   1.90   2.20 \nAdditional capital outlays  0.05   0.20   0.20   0.20   0.15 \nDebt stock  32.83   32.20  31.41   30.70   30.01 \n( ) = negative. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n ", "9 \nC.  Governance \n \n28.  As part of program preparation, a governance risk assessment was conducted along the \nlines  prescribed  by  the  implementation  guidelines  of  ADB\u2019s  Second  Governance  and \nAnticorruption Action Plan. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was also \nexplained  to  and  discussed  with  the  GOWB\u2019s  Finance  Department.  Consistent  with  its \ncommitment to good governance, the implementation of the program will adhere to ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy. This assessment was complemented by a review of areas of possible risk \nand vulnerability in state financial management. The assessment found some risks that could \naffect the proposed program. They include risks related to (i) political support for and ownership \nof GOWB, especially for sensitive reforms; and (ii) institutional dimensions of the proposed \nprogram (e.g., weak capacity in the relevant institutions). The financial assessment found several \nareas of concern: (i) weak appraisal capacity of investment projects and integration of capital and \ncurrent budgets through proper planning, (ii) weak  internal audit systems, and (iii) lack of \nalignment  between  sector  goals  and  resource  allocation. 26  While  no  major  risks  of \nmismanagement of resources at the executing level can be discerned, issues identified in the \nfinancial assessments are targeted for capacity development under the TA and policy changes \nunder the loan.  \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n29.  The poverty reduction and social impacts of the program are positive. The support for \naugmenting and sustaining development financing will have a substantial impact on human and \nincome poverty. The program\u2019s emphasis on better expenditure targeting, especially in health and \neducation through linking MTEFs with budget allocations, is clearly geared toward protecting the \npoor and other vulnerable groups. The health indicators for women and children in the state are \npoor because of ineffective delivery of public services and lack of adequate budget allocations. \nThis is manifest in many ways. For example, higher maternal mortality rates in West Bengal, \ncompared with some other advanced states, reflect inadequate health services and facilities for \nantenatal and obstetric care. Rectifying these problems becomes more challenging if GOWB is \nunable to invest in economic and social infrastructure\u2015either directly or through partnerships with \nthe private sector.27 \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n30.  Given the nature of the program, all three safeguard categories (environment, involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples) are categorized C. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n31.  Major risks and mitigating measures are described in detail in the risk assessment and \nrisk management plan.28 Fiduciary risks are moderate because of strong commitment of GOWB \nto reforms, as evidenced in the first program. Overall, the risks are assessed to be low and the \nintegrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs.  \n \n \n                                                \n26 An updated Results-Based Public Sector Management Assessment Framework (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n27 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n28 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nTable 3: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nGOWB\u2019s commitment to sensitive  ADB staff will engage continually with GOWB, and will adopt \nfiscal reforms is not sustained.  pre-emptive strategy to avoid potential bottlenecks.
