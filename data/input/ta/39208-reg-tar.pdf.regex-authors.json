In November 2001, the World Trade Organization (WTO) launched a new round of \nmultilateral trade negotiations known as the Doha Development Agenda (DDA), or Doha Round, \nto revitalize the world economy through the expansion of trade. As trade plays a key role in \nreducing poverty through faster economic growth, international institutions are invited to assist \ndeveloping  member  countries  (DMCs)  in  international  trade.  Capacity  development  is \nparticularly essential, to integrate the DMCs into the WTO multilateral trading system, as called \nfor in the statements of the Group of Seven (G7), Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) \nleaders\u2019 meetings, and WTO ministerial conferences. \n2.  In  May  2002,  the  WTO  and  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  concluded  a \nmemorandum of understanding to cooperate in technical assistance in WTO-related issues in \nthe region. At the request of the Government of Japan, made to the President on behalf of the \nAPEC economies, ADB\u2019s Economics and Research Department launched three WTO-related \ncapacity development programs in 2002,1 2003,2 and 2004.3 The responses to an evaluation \nquestionnaire  indicated  that  these  activities  have  achieved  the  expected  outcomes.  Many \nparticipants  also  requested  a  focus  on  trade  facilitation  in  future  capacity  development \nprograms.4   \n3.  The proposed capacity development program is supported by technical assistance (TA). \nThe fourth of this kind, it is designed to provide technical inputs to customs administrations of \nDMCs that are members of the WTO to help them develop a detailed plan for implementing the \nAgreement on Trade Facilitation. Appendix 1 gives the framework of the TA.5 \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  In July 2004, the General Council of the WTO, the highest decision-making body of the \norganization, decided to include trade facilitation in the Doha Round as a new area under the \nso-called \u201cJuly 2004 Package.\u201d Trade facilitation negotiations in the DDA cover public trade \nprocedures for exports and imports, but almost all of these are customs-related and the WTO \nhas no clear and detailed rules for trade facilitation at present.  \n5.  Trade facilitation is essential for trade expansion. Recent ADB and APEC studies show \nthat trade facilitation measures would generate more gains than trade liberalization measures.6 \nWTO  members  must  implement  all  the  DDA  agreements  under  the  \u201csingle  undertaking\u201d \ncommitment, but implementing the lengthy agreement (Appendix 2), with its detailed provisions, \nwould be burdensome to DMCs, particularly their customs authorities. \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2002.

Manila: ADB. \n ", "2   \n6.  Before  the  start  of  negotiations  for  trade  facilitation,  DMCs  demanded  and  got  a \ncommitment from all WTO members that technical assistance and capacity development in both \ntrade facilitation negotiations and implementation of the agreement on trade facilitation would be \nprovided to them. In fact, the July 2004 Package for Modalities for Negotiations on Trade \nFacilitation states that \n7.  Negotiations shall aim to clarify and improve relevant aspects of Articles V (freedom of \ntransit),  VIII  (fees  and  formalities  connected  with  importation  and  exportation),  and  X \n(publication and administration of trade regulation) of the 1994 General Agreement on Tariffs \nand Trade with a view to further expediting the movement, release and clearance of goods\u2026. \n8.  It  is  recognized  that  the  provision  of  technical  assistance  and  support  for  capacity \nbuilding is vital for developing and least-developed countries to enable them to fully participate \nin and benefit from the negotiations. \n9.  Support and assistance should also be provided to help developing and least-developed \ncountries implement the commitments resulting from the negotiations\u2026. \n10.  In  order  to  make  technical  assistance  and  capacity  building  more  effective  and \noperational  and  to  ensure  better  coherence,  Members  shall  invite  relevant  international \norganizations\u2026to undertake a collaborative effort in this regard. \n11.  To date, more than 140 proposals on various elements of trade facilitation have been \nsubmitted. It is expected that, once the DDA freeze is lifted, a first draft agreement on trade \nfacilitation will be tabled. It is therefore necessary to provide capacity development to customs \nadministrations  of  DMCs  that  are  WTO  members  for  the  smooth  implementation  of  the \nAgreement on Trade Facilitation. Capacity development in the following areas is particularly \nvital: \n(i)  examination of the contents of the agreement and identification of the obligations \nof WTO members under the agreement; \n(ii)  listing of legal, operational, and organizational measures and changes required \nto implement the agreement in the light of the existing framework; and \n(iii)  preparation of a realistic implementation plan.        \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The TA will enable DMCs to develop a plan for implementing the WTO Agreement on \nTrade Facilitation. To this end, the TA will provide the DMCs with a clear understanding of the \ncontents  of  the  Agreement  on  Trade  Facilitation,  in  particular  the  obligations  of  customs \nadministrations under the agreement, to equip the DMCs and their customs administrations with \nthe necessary knowledge and skills.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The TA\u2019s capacity development program has four components.   \nCustoms  DG-Commissioner  Meeting  on  Trade  Facilitation,  February  2007,  Asian \nDevelopment Bank Institute (ADBI), Tokyo. This 3-day high-level meeting will focus on policy \naspects of the Agreement on Trade Facilitation, e.g., the political importance of the agreement \n ", "  3\nin international trade, and the economic benefits from the implementation of the agreement. \nOther key trade facilitation issues, such as partnership with the private sector, use of information \ntechnology, and regional cooperation, will also be addressed.  At the same time, the proposed \nregional TA will be introduced to maximize its benefits to the DMCs. The World Customs \nOrganization (WCO) and the Customs and Tariff Bureau of Japan\u2019s Ministry of Finance will fully \ncollaborate with ADB in this activity. Customs directors-general and commissioners from 23 \nselected DMCs will be invited to participate.  \n14.  Intensive Course on Obligations of Customs Administration under the Agreement \non Trade Facilitation, June 2007, Thailand Resident Mission, Bangkok, Thailand. This 5-\nday training course will address the contents of the agreement and the obligations of WTO \nmembers under it. It will require detailed technical analysis of the agreement. In addition, the \nobligations of customs administration under the agreement must be identified in a detailed and \nprecise manner in preparation for the next step, i.e., comparison of the legal framework with the \nobligations under the agreement.  Customs officials with the rank of director who take charge of \ntrade facilitation in 23 selected DMCs will be invited to participate. \n15.  Intensive Course on Possible Measures and Changes Required to Implement the \nAgreement on Trade Facilitation, March 2008, Customs Academy, Malacca, Malaysia. This \n8-day course will examine the differences between the customs-related laws of DMCs and the \nDMCs\u2019 obligations under the agreement. These differences, which will vary between DMCs, \nmust be identified before amendments to the customs-related laws, regulations, and directives \nare drafted to implement the agreement. WCO is expected to undertake case studies on the \ndifferences between the customs-related laws of a couple of DMCs and present the outcome at \nthis course. Customs officials with the rank of director who are in charge of trade facilitation in \n23 selected DMCs will participate. \n16.  Intensive  Course  on  the  Implementation  Plan  of  the  Agreement  on  Trade \nFacilitation,  June  2008,  ADBI,  Tokyo,  Japan.    This  5-day  course  will  examine  the \nimplementation plans prepared, submitted, and presented by the DMCs. Experts will provide \ntechnical advice on trade facilitation to enable the implementation plan to be finalized. Customs \nofficials with the rank of director who are involved in drafting the implementation plan for the \nAgreement on Trade Facilitation in 23 selected DMCs will attend the course. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $450,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on \na grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The details of \nthe cost estimates and financing plan are shown in Appendix 3. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  ADB\u2019s Economics Research Department will implement the TA in cooperation with WCO \nand the Government of Japan. Implementation is expected to begin in January 2007 and to end \nin September 2008. A detailed curriculum for the four intensive courses will be developed in \ncollaboration with WCO and the Customs Authority of the Government of Japan. WTO, WCO, \nand customs authorities of Australia, Japan, and New Zealand are expected to provide experts \nin trade facilitation. \n ", "4   \n19.  Twelve resource persons who are experts in trade facilitation will be recruited for 2 \nperson-months for the high-level meeting and the three intensive courses. They will be hired \nindividually by ADB according to its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (April 2006, as \namended from time to time). The TA will finance travel and per diem, as well as the honoraria of \nresource persons in certain cases (Appendix 4). The customs authorities of Australia, Japan, \nand New Zealand are, however, expected to partly finance the participation of their experts as \nin-kind contributions to the program.   \n20.  The  DMC  participants  will  come  from  Bangladesh;  Brunei  Darussalam;  Cambodia; \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China; Fiji Islands; Hong Kong, China; India; Indonesia; Republic of Korea; \nKyrgyz  Republic;  Malaysia;  Maldives;  Mongolia;  Myanmar;  Nepal;  Pakistan;  Papua  New \nGuinea;  Philippines;  Singapore;  Solomon  Islands;  Sri  Lanka;  Taipei,China;  and  Thailand.7  \nHong  Kong,  China;  Republic  of  Korea;  Singapore;  and  Taipei,China  will  be  requested  to \nshoulder the cost of their participation in the four activities. \n21.  Information  about  the  four  activities  will  be  published  on  ADB\u2019s  Web  site.  The \nparticipants will evaluate the activities through a structured questionnaire.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $450,000 on a grant basis for \nthe Capacity Development of Selected Developing Member Countries on the Implementation of \nthe Trade Facilitation Agreement of the World Trade Organization, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n \n \n                                                 \n7  Tonga and Viet Nam have been admitted to WTO subject to the necessary domestic ratification procedures.
