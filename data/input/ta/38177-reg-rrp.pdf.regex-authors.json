No  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts  are \nanticipated. \n   \nProject Description  The Project is a continuation of Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nsupport  for  customs  reform  and  modernization  for  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic and Tajikistan following the launch of the Regional Trade \nFacilitation and Customs Cooperation Program in December 2002. \nThis program initially consisted of two program loans for the two \ncountries, two project preparatory technical assistance (TA) grants \nand a regional TA to support regional customs cooperation in the \nEast  and  Central  Asian  region.  Demonstrating  ADB\u2019s  long-term \nengagement in the sector, the Project will reinforce the ongoing \ncustoms legal and institutional reforms supported by the program \nloans, and strengthen the two countries\u2019 participation in regional \ncustoms cooperation.  \n \nThe Project comprises two components for the Kyrgyz Republic \nand  Tajikistan  to  develop  (i)  a  unified  automated  information \nsystem (UAIS), and (ii) customs border-post infrastructure. \n \nThis first component consists of three interrelated subcomponents \nto  (i)  develop  core  UAIS  application  systems  and  associated \noperations-support  systems,  (ii)  develop  communications \ninfrastructure  to  support  UAIS  operation  (i.e.,  provide  and \nstrengthen  communication  links  between  customs  headquarters, \nregional customs offices, and border posts), and (iii) train staff and \ndevelop a public awareness campaign to ensure sustainability and \nbroad-based support for customs modernization. \n \nThe second component aims to (i) improve customs border posts \nand facilities, (ii) provide customs operations and antismuggling \nequipment, and (iii) extend capacity building and promote border \ninteragency cooperation. ", "         iii \n \n \nRationale  Since independence in 1991, the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan \nhave been in transition to private sector-led and market-oriented \neconomies.  Since  both  countries  are  highly  dependent  on \ninternational  trade,  development  of  an  outward-oriented  trading \nenvironment is an integral part of the transition strategy. Significant \nprogress has been made in trade liberalization and trade-related \npolicy  reforms  in  both  countries  as  evidenced  by  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic\u2019s accession to the World Trade Organization in 1998 and \nTajikistan\u2019s preparatory progress in this regard.  \n \nProgress  in  trade  facilitation  is  equally  significant  and  has \neffectively  complemented  trade  policy  reforms.  As  tariffs  have \ncome  down,  trade  facilitation  in  terms  of  reducing  government \nbureaucracy, and harmonizing and automating trade procedures is \nwidely  recognized  as  just  as  important  as  trade  liberalization \nmeasures. Of all the agencies relevant to trade facilitation and \nborder controls, customs administration is commonly recognized as \none of the most important because of its border control functions, \nrevenue  collection,  and  prevention  of  smuggling  and  drug \ntrafficking. \n \nThe customs administrations of the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan \nare relatively young, with weak institutional capacity, low efficiency, \nand poor governance. To address these weaknesses, in 2002 both \ncountries  launched  comprehensive  modernization  programs  to \nfacilitate  trade  and  thus  reduce  the  most  critical  bottleneck. \nSupported  by  ADB  and  other  major  international  financial \ninstitutions, both countries adopted a comprehensive program of \nreforms and modernization consisting of (i) improving the customs \nlegal and regulatory framework, (ii) strengthening governance and \ninstitutional capacity, (iii) promoting regional customs cooperation, \nand (iv) developing customs infrastructure to improve operational \nefficiency and revenue collection.  \n \nSignificant progress has been made, particularly with legal and \ninstitutional  reforms,  and  strengthening  of  cooperation  with  the \ncustoms  administrations  of  neighboring  countries.  However,  the \nbenefits  of  customs  legal  and  institutional  reforms  and  regional \ncustoms  cooperation  initiatives  cannot  be  fully  realized,  unless \nthere is commensurate development and modernization of customs \nphysical infrastructure to improve efficiency and transparency of \ncustoms services. The Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan do not have \nadequate information and communication technology infrastructure \nto support automated customs services. The border-post conditions \nare poor because of inadequate budget support and the effects of \nthe civil war in Tajikistan.  \n \n ", "iv   \n \n  The Project is directly relevant to ADB\u2019s strategic objectives in the \ntwo countries. The overall objective of the Country Strategy and \nProgram  for  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  for  2004\u20132006  is  to  reduce \npoverty  by  promoting  private  sector-led  economic  growth  and \nproviding selective support for human development. ADB supports \nprivate sector-led economic growth through (i) agriculture and rural \ndevelopment, (ii) financial sector development, and (iii) regional \ncooperation with an emphasis on trade and transport infrastructure. \nThe Country Strategy and Program for Tajikistan for 2004\u20132008 \nfocuses on promoting economic growth through rural development \nand regional cooperation. \n \nTrade facilitation is a strategic pillar of ADB\u2019s Regional Cooperation \nStrategy and Program for 2005\u20132007 and the Project is a priority \nproject. ADB supports trade facilitation by helping to (i) modernize \ncustoms  infrastructure,  including  customs  legal  and  physical \ninfrastructure;  (ii)  develop  customs-supporting  infrastructure  by \nfostering customs intermediaries and their associations (such as \nbrokers\u2019  associations);  and  (iii)  support  regional  customs \ncooperation to address issues of common concerns (e.g., regional \ntransit development), and complement country-specific support. \n   \nObjectives  The  Project\u2019s  objectives  are  to  (i)  improve  the  efficiency  and \ntransparency  of  customs  services,  and  reinforce  the  ongoing \ncustoms legal reforms and simplification of custom procedures; and \n(ii)  facilitate  trade  and  promote  regional  customs  cooperation \nthrough concerted customs reforms and modernization in the East \nand Central Asian region. \n   \nCost Estimates  The total project cost is estimated at $22.75 million equivalent. The \nKyrgyz component is estimated to cost $9.37 million equivalent \n(foreign exchange cost of $4.83 million and local currency cost of \n$4.54  million  equivalent),  and  the  Tajikistan  component  is \nestimated to cost $13.38 million equivalent (foreign exchange cost \nof $8.42 million and local currency cost of $4.96 million equivalent). \nFinancing Plan   \n($ million) \n  Foreign  Local  Total   \nSource  Exchange  Currency  Cost  Percent \nKyrgyz Republic         \nADB  4.83  2.67  7.50  80 \nGovernment   0.00  1.87  1.87  20 \n   Total  4.83  4.54  9.37  100 \n         \nTajikistan         \nADB  8.42  2.28  10.70  80 \nGovernment   0.00  2.68  2.68  20 \n   Total  8.42  4.96  13.38  100 \n ADB = Asian Development Bank. \n ", "         v \n \n \nLoan Amount and Terms  Loans in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights \n(SDR) 5,106,000 ($7.5 million equivalent) for the Kyrgyz Republic \nand SDR7,266,000 ($10.7 million equivalent) for Tajikistan will be \nprovided from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. The loans will have \nan amortization period of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 \nyears, an interest rate of 1% per annum on the principal amount \ndisbursed  during  the  grace  period,  1.5%  per  year  during  the \nremaining amortization period, and such other terms and conditions \nset forth in the draft loan and project agreements. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2010 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2009 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Kyrgyz component: Ministry of Finance (MOF)  \nTajikistan  component:  Ministry  of  State  Revenues  and  Duties \n(MSRD)  \n   \nImplementation  The Committee for Revenues under MOF will be the Implementing \nArrangements  Agency  for  the  Kyrgyz  project  component,  and  the  Customs \nServices  Department  under  MSRD  will  be  the  Implementing \nAgency  for  the  Tajikistan  component.  Each  government  will \nestablish a project steering committee (PSC) before or immediately \nafter  loan  effectiveness  to  guide  the  overall  direction  and \ncoordinate issues related to project implementation. In the Kyrgyz \nRepublic, the PSC will be headed by the chair of Committee for \nRevenues  and  include  the  CSD  head  and  deputy  head.  In \nTajikistan,  the  PSC  will  be  chaired  by  the  MSRD  minister  and \ninclude the CSD head and deputy head. Both PSCs will comprise \nrepresentatives  from  relevant  Government  agencies  and  private \nsector. \n \nThe chair of the Committee for Revenues in the Kyrgyz Republic \nand  the  MSRD  minister  in  Tajikistan  will  be  designated  as  the \nproject directors with overall responsibility for project management. \nEach project director will appoint a senior CSD staff member as \ndeputy  project  director.  To  oversee  day-to-day  project \nimplementation, a full-time project management office (PMO) will \nbe set up within the Committee for Revenues for the Kyrgyz project \nand the CSD for the Tajikistan project component. The PMO will be \nheaded by a qualified PMO director and deputy director assisted by \na group of qualified technical and administrative specialists. The \nPMO  will  remain  adequately  staffed  throughout  project \nimplementation  and  be  assisted  by  international  and  domestic \nconsultants financed by the loan and the accompanying TA. \n   ", "vi   \n \nProcurement  All services, supplies, and equipment to be financed by ADB will be \nprocured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \nEquipment and materials for packages valued at $500,000 or more \nwill be procured through international competitive bidding. Supply \ncontracts and items costing less than $500,000 will be procured \nusing  international  shopping.  Equipment  and  materials  costing \n$100,000 or less will be procured through direct purchase.  \n \nCivil works contracts estimated at $1 million equivalent or more will \nbe  carried  out  by  prequalified  contractors  using  international \ncompetitive bidding, while those valued below $1 million equivalent \nwill use local competitive bidding procedures acceptable to ADB. \nForce account, with an upper limit of $50,000 per package, will be \napplied to border-post infrastructure development. \n   \nConsulting Services  The  consultants  will  be  engaged  either  as  individuals,  and/or \nconsulting  firm(s)  of  international  consultants  with  domestic \nassociates to be selected following the quality-  and  cost-based \nselection method, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants. The implementing agencies and ADB have agreed \nthat most of the consultants will be hired through firms. Domestic \nconsultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB.  The  Kyrgyz  component  will \nrequire about 20 person-months of international and 45 person-\nmonths  of  domestic  consulting  services;  and  the  Tajikistan \ncomponent,  24  person-months  of  international  and  52  person-\nmonths of domestic consulting services. \n   ", "        v ii \n \n \nProject Benefits and  The Project is expected to have an economic internal rate of return \nBeneficiaries  of 21.50% for the Kyrgyz component and 23.34% for the Tajikistan \ncomponent. The main benefits accruing include economic benefits \nfrom  (i)  trade  expansion  and  associated  economic  growth  and \nemployment  generation,  and  (ii)  efficiency  gains  from  reduced \ntransaction costs and waiting times at border crossings and inland \nclearance points. The Project will have a positive impact on overall \neconomic development because trade is an engine for growth and \ncustoms services modernization is key for facilitating trade and \nimproving the enabling environment for private sector-led economic \ndevelopment.  \n \nThe Project will have a positive regional impact by (i) improving \ntransit conditions of the two countries, greatly facilitating trade with \nneighboring countries, (ii) contributing to the improvement of the \noverall trading and investment environment in the region through \nstrengthened regional customs cooperation for trade facilitation and \nprevention of smuggling and drug trafficking.  \n \nReduced transaction costs make trade in small volumes possible \nand therefore directly benefit poor and small traders. The overall \nsocial  benefit  derives  from  increased  revenue  collection  that \ncontributes to sound fiscal management and provision of social \nservices.  \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The governments are fully committed to customs modernization \nand  trade  facilitation  thus  mitigating  the  risk  of  lack  of  political \ncommitment for customs reform and modernization. The adoption \nof the revised customs codes provides the legal foundation for \nsimplifying  customs  procedures,  and  automating  and  applying \nthese at border posts. Project-specific risks may include (i) lack of \ncommitment to change management, and resistance from vested \ninterest groups that benefit from lack of transparency and inefficient \ncustoms  clearance  systems,  (ii)  lack  of  consultation  and \ncooperation  with  the  trade  community  and  relevant  government \nagencies, (iii) the implementing agencies\u2019 difficulty recruiting and \nretaining  competent  and  experienced  information  technology \npersonnel, and (iv) inadequate budget provision for maintenance \nand following phases of customs modernization. These risks are \nmitigated by the ongoing measures adopted by the two countries\u2019 \nexecuting agencies, the project and TA design, and government \nassurances. \n   ", "viii  \n \nTechnical Assistance  Two accompanying grant-financed TAs will be provided; one each \nto  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan  to  help  ensure  that  (i) \ncustoms  modernization  through  automation  and  border-post \ninfrastructure  development  is  supported  by  the  institutional \nstructure and the business processes of the CSDs, and (ii) the \nUAIS and border-post infrastructure development are carried out \nwith sound supervision and quality assurance. Each TA consists of \nthree  components:  (i)  change  management  and  public-private \npartnership  for  customs  modernization,  (ii)  reengineering  of \ncustoms  business  processes,  and  (iii)  quality  and  security \nassurance of the UAIS and border-post infrastructure development. \n \nEach  TA  is  expected  to  cost  $600,000  equivalent,  comprising \n$400,000  in  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $200,000  equivalent  in \nlocal currency cost. ADB will provide the TAs on a grant basis, \n$500,000  each  to  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan  from  the \nJapan  Special  Fund,  funded  by  the  Government  of  Japan,  to \nfinance the entire foreign exchange cost and $100,000 equivalent \nof  the  local  currency  cost.  The  Government  will  finance  the \nremaining $100,000 equivalent of local currency cost. \n \nThe TAs will finance 14 person-months of international consulting \nfor the Kyrgyz Republic and 12 person-months for Tajikistan, and \n58 person-months of domestic consulting for each country. The \nproposed  international  and  domestic  consultants  include                   \n(i) customs modernization and change management specialist (2 \nperson-months international and 10 person-months domestic for \neach country); (ii) customs automation and procedures specialist (8 \nperson-months international for the Kyrgyz Republic and 6 person-\nmonths international for Tajikistan, and 24 person-months domestic \nfor each country); (iii) information and communication technology \nquality  and  security  assurance  specialist  (4  person-months \ninternational and 18 person-months domestic for each country); \nand  (iv)  civil  works  and  construction  supervision  specialist  (6 \nperson-months domestic for each country). The TA consultants will \nwork closely with the implementing agencies, relevant agencies \nand institutions, the PMO, private sector stakeholders, and ADB \nstaff.  \n   \n \n \n ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on the proposed \nloans  to  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  the  Republic  of  Tajikistan  for  the  Regional  Customs \nModernization and Infrastructure Development Project. The report also describes proposed \ntechnical assistance (TA) for Capacity Building and Institutional Strengthening for Customs \nModernization and Infrastructure Development in each of the Kyrgyz Republic and the Republic \nof Tajikistan, and if the Board approves the proposed loans, I, acting under the authority \ndelegated to me by the Board, will approve the TAs.  \n \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n2.  Recognizing the importance of trade for countries\u2019 transition to a market economy and \nprivate sector-led economic development, most of the Central Asian republics have embarked \non  comprehensive  trade  policy  reforms  and  trade  facilitation  measures  since  gaining \nindependence in the early 1990s. Due to their land-locked conditions, they rely on each other for \ntransit trade; the benefits of trade can only be realized through concerted regional efforts to \nimprove the trading environment. Such a concerted effort is being rigorously pursued by the \nCentral Asian republics, as demonstrated by their (i) collective commitment to accession to the \nWorld Trade Organization (WTO) and reform of trade policies according to WTO rules and \nagreements;  and  (ii)  concerted  efforts  to  reform  customs  codes  and  modernize  customs \nservices as key measures to facilitate trade.  \n \n3.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) plays a major role to provide support for a regional \nand concerted approach for trade policy reforms and trade facilitation. In 2002, the Regional \nTrade Facilitation and Customs Cooperation Program (RTFCCP) was launched as part of the \nbroad Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Program. The RTFCCP is a \ncombination of support for (i) bilateral and regional customs cooperation initiatives, and (ii) \ncountry-specific activities with strong regional orientation. A key objective of the RTFCCP is to \npromote concerted customs reforms and modernization of the CAREC member countries in an \neffort to harmonize customs legal frameworks and procedures. To support the CAREC member \ncountries\u2019 accession to WTO and trade policy reforms, a trade policy committee was recently \ncreated as part of the CAREC Program to be coordinated by the International Monetary Fund. \nThe first trade policy committee meeting was conducted as part of the Senior Officials\u2019 Meeting \non 13\u201314 September 2004 in preparation for the Third Ministerial Conference on 31 October \nand 1 November 2004.  \n \n4.  The Project is a continuation of ADB\u2019s support for customs reforms and modernization \nfor the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan following the launch of the RTFCCP. The initial phase of \nthe  RTFCCP  consisted  of  program  loans  for  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan,1  project \npreparatory  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  customs  modernization  and  infrastructure \n                                                \n1   ADB. 2002.

The Project \nwill  support  the  implementation  of  the  two  countries\u2019  poverty  reduction  strategies  by  (i) \nimproving governance practices and (ii) promoting sustained economic growth. It will reinforce \nthe  ongoing  customs  legal  and  institutional  reforms  supported  by  the  program  loans,  and \nstrengthen the two countries\u2019 participation in regional customs cooperation activities supported \nby ADB. The Project Framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n5.  Since independence in 1991, the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan have been in transition \nto  private  sector-led  and  market-oriented  economies.  Development  of  an  outward-oriented \ntrading environment is an integral part of the transition strategy. Both countries are highly \ndependent on international trade, with exports in 2003 accounting for 31% of gross domestic \nproduct for the Kyrgyz Republic and 57% for Tajikistan. However, the two countries\u2019 external \nsectors are vulnerable to changes in terms-of-trade due to the dominance of raw materials and \nagriculture products in exports and the narrow production base. With a combination of trade \nliberalization and trade facilitation measures, the governments aim to diversify exports, broaden \nthe production base, and improve the enabling environment for foreign direct investment and \ntrade, including transit trade of neighboring countries. Recent economic development and sector \nanalysis are provided in Appendix 2.  \n \n6.  Significant  progress  has  been  made  in  trade  liberalization  and  trade-related  policy \nreforms in both countries. The Kyrgyz Republic became a WTO member in 1998 in recognition \nof its achievements in trade and trade-related policy reforms. Tajikistan is in the advanced \nstages of WTO accession. The tariff structure is compliant with WTO\u2019s rules, with the adoption \nof a single tariff band of 5%, except for areas subject to preferential agreements and treaties. A \nwide range of trade-related policies have been amended in conformity with the relevant WTO \nagreements, particularly in foreign direct investment policy and financial services liberalization. \n \n7.  Progress in trade facilitation is equally significant and effectively complements trade \npolicy reforms. As tariffs have come down, trade facilitation in terms of reducing government \nbureaucracy and harmonizing and automating trade procedures is widely recognized as just as \nimportant as trade liberalization measures. Among all the agencies relevant to trade facilitation \nand border controls, the customs administration is commonly recognized as one of the most \nimportant, because of its revenue collection function and prevention of smuggling and drug \ntrafficking. \n \n8.  The  customs  administrations  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan\u2014the  customs \nservices  departments  (CSDs)\u2014are  relatively  young,  with  weak  institutional  capacity,  low \nefficiency,  and  poor  governance.  In  2002,  both  countries  launched  comprehensive \nmodernization programs to address this most critical bottleneck of trade facilitation.5 Supported \nby  major  international  financial  institutions,  both  countries  adopted  a  program  of  reforms \n                                                \n2  ADB.  2002.

ADB \nhas been supporting the reform agenda through a program loan for each country. By 24 June \n2004, the Kyrgyz Republic had complied with all six core conditions in the policy matrix for the \nsecond tranche release of the program loan, and six of the eight monitoring conditions. The \nsecond tranche was released on 15 September 2004. Tajikistan has complied with five of the \neight core conditions, while the remaining three are expected to be complied with by the end of \nDecember 2004\u2014the target date for the second tranche release. The revised Customs Code of \nTajikistan was submitted to Parliament on 30 September 2004 to comply with a major core \ncondition. Tajikistan\u2019s CSD is also actively (i) pursuing a transit agreement with the Kyrgyz \nRepublic, and (ii) facilitating the development of a brokers\u2019 association to comply with the two \nremaining  core  conditions.  CSD  has  also  made  considerable  progress  in  complying  with \nTajikistan\u2019s  24  monitoring  conditions.

Legal  and  Regulatory  Framework.  The  main  focus  has  been  the  revision  of  the \nCustoms Code. The Legislative Chamber of the Kyrgyz Republic Parliament ratified the new \nCustoms Code on 13 April 2004, and the Kyrgyz President approved it on 12 July 2004. For \nTajikistan, the final version of the revised Customs Code was submitted to Parliament on 30 \nSeptember 2004. The revised customs codes have two important features: (i) they are in line \nwith the Revised Kyoto Convention, which serves as a benchmark for reforms and customs \nmodernization of customs administrations worldwide; and (ii) they provide detailed regulations \nand procedural guidance for all customs control regimes, which will greatly help reduce the \nnumber of existing customs regulations. The existence of multiple customs regulations is a \nmajor source of confusion, corruption, and tension between customs officers and traders during \ncustoms clearance. Simplification of the existing customs regulations and procedures is a key \nobjective of revising the customs codes. Concerted customs legal reforms in line with the \ninternational  conventions  support  the  process  of  harmonizing  customs  procedures  in  the \nECAR\u2014a major RTFCCP initiative.  \n \n10.  Governance and Institutional Reform. The CSDs in both countries have implemented \nseveral  measures  to  enhance  staff  morale,  strengthen  internal  management,  and  reduce \ncorruption. Human resource management has significantly improved through the adoption of a \nstaff appraisal system that objectively evaluates staff performance, and a compensation system \nthat responds to staff evaluation and rewards outstanding performance. To reduce corruption, \nboth  the  revised  customs  codes  and  codes  of  conduct  include  articles  and  regulations \nprohibiting customs officers from acting as customs intermediaries. To improve transparency \nand client-orientation of customs services, both the CSDs (i) maintain periodicals to inform the \npublic of customs statistics and legal and regulatory changes, (ii) maintain a consultative council \nto dialogue with traders and their representatives, and (iii) conduct regular surveys to strengthen \nclient  orientation  of  customs  services.  These  legal  and  personnel  measures  help  reduce \ncorruption and improve professionalism of customs officers.  \n \n                                                \n6  Two progress reports were prepared for the second tranche release of the program loans for the Kyrgyz Republic \nand Tajikistan.  ", "4  \n11.  Regional  Customs  Cooperation.7  The  launch  of  the  RTFCCP  has  significantly \nstrengthened the two countries\u2019 policy dialogue and cooperation with customs administrations of \nneighboring countries. The customs cooperation activities supported by the regional TA is \ncoordinated and supervised by the Customs Cooperation Committee, comprising heads of the \ncustoms departments of eight ADB developing member countries in the ECAR, including the \nKyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan. The Customs Cooperation Committee serves as an effective \nforum  for  addressing  regional  issues  of  common  concern,  such  as  developing  transit \narrangements and sharing customs data to reduce corruption. Customs officials from the Kyrgyz \nRepublic and Tajikistan cochair the transit development initiative, and are actively promoting \ntransit  agreements  initially  involving  Kazakhstan,  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  and  Tajikistan.  The \nKyrgyz  Republic  entered  into  a  transit  agreement  with  Kazakhstan  on  26  March  2004. \nSponsored  by  ADB,  the  customs  administrations  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan \nconducted two rounds of consultation on a draft transit agreement, and both parties agreed to \ntarget the signing of the agreement by the end of 2004. The Kyrgyz Republic is also making \nprogress  in  developing  a  data-sharing  agreement  with  the  customs  office  of  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China\u2014to be signed by the end of 2004. Tajikistan recently opened a new border \npost with the People\u2019s Republic of China. \n  \n12.  Development of Customs Physical Infrastructure. Development of customs physical \ninfrastructure  is  an  integral  part  of  government  efforts  to  facilitate  trade,  improve  revenue \ncollection,  reduce  corruption,  and  stop  smuggling  and  drug  trafficking.  Of  the  Customs \nCooperation Committee member countries, the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan have the least \ninfrastructure capacity in terms of customs automation and border-post facilities, because of \ninadequate budget support and destruction during the civil war in the case of Tajikistan. Neither \ncountry has an automated customs declaration system for exports and imports. Their limited \ninformation  and  communication  technology  (ICT)  infrastructure  does  not  support  modern \ncustoms practices based on risk management and postentry audit as promulgated in the revised \nCustoms Code and the Revised Kyoto Convention.8 Without customs automation and adequate \nborder-post infrastructure, the benefits of customs legal reforms and procedure simplification \ncannot be fully realized, and regional customs cooperation initiatives cannot be effectively \ncarried out. \n \n13.  In the Kyrgyz Republic, a local area network is only available in CSD headquarters and \ntwo regional customs offices. Servers and a limited number of computers are available at CSD \nheadquarters. Communication between the headquarters and the 15 regional customs offices is \nthrough the Government\u2019s wide area network, which has low capacity and functions poorly. \nNone of the border posts have communication facilities, resulting in delay of the submission of \ncustoms statistics to customs headquarters.  \n \n14.  Of the five regional offices in Tajikistan, only one has telecommunications tools for data \nexchange  through  a  radio  communications  data-transfer  system.  Data  exchange  between \n                                                \n7 ADB. 2004. Regional Trade Facilitation and Customs Cooperation Program, Progress, and Future Directions. \nManila. \n8 Risk management is a broadly recognized modern customs technique allowing customs to clear increasing volumes   \nof goods, while minimizing the risk of not detecting wrongly declared transactions as well as those covered by \nfraudulent documents. Its application requires establishment of risk profiles in a computer system that contain \ninformation on the history of transactions of traders, origin, and route of their imports. Traders with \u201clow risk profile\u201d \nare distinguished from those with \u201chigh risk profiles\u201d allowing customs to facilitate traders with low risk profiles and \ndevote more resources to inspect traders with high risk profiles. Post-entry audit allows customs to examine the \nbook and records of traders especially those identified as high risk. It helps improve the risk profiles and strengthen \nthe risk management system.  \n ", "  5\nborder posts and regional offices are carried out using floppy disks. A major source of revenue \nloss  and  corruption  at  border  posts  has  been  the  lack  of  technology  capacity  to  capture \nimporters\u2019 entry data for customs declaration in a centralized location to calculate duties and \ntaxes and validate the entry. The quality of customs statistics is poor and cannot be readily \nverified and easily distributed to the relevant Government agencies for trade facilitation and \nantismuggling purposes.  \n \n15.  The border-post conditions in both countries are poor mainly due to inadequate budget \nprovision for construction and maintenance. Very few border posts have permanent structures \noriginally  designed  for  customs  operations.  Customs  equipment  for  inspection  and \nantismuggling  purposes  is  rarely  present  or  operational.  Very  few  customs  posts  have \nequipment for weighing and preventing contraband and drug trafficking. At most border posts, \nelectricity  supply  is  unstable  and  at  best  provided  only  7-8  hours  a  day,  thus  increasing \nopportunities for illicit trade.  \n \n16.  Recognizing these constraints and the need to modernize customs services to improve \ntransparency and fight corruption, both governments adopted strategies to develop a unified \nautomated information system (UAIS). The UAIS as a development concept is embraced by all \nthe customs administrations joining the RTFCCP under the CAREC Program. It includes not \nonly developing software and hardware for automating customs declaration, but also introducing \nmodern  customs  techniques  (e.g.,  simplified  customs  procedures  and  a  risk  management \nsystem), management information system, change management, and capacity building and \ninstitution building to ensure broad-based support and sustainability of the UAIS. The Project is \nan important step in helping the governments realize the concept of the UAIS and develop \nborder-post infrastructure.  \n \n2.  The Asian Development Bank Strategy \n17.  The Project is directly relevant to ADB\u2019s strategic objectives for the two countries. The \noverall objective of the Country Strategy and Program for the Kyrgyz Republic (2004\u20132006) is to \nreduce  poverty,  supported  by  (i)  promotion  of  private  sector-led  economic  growth  and  (ii) \nselective support for human development. Regional cooperation with an emphasis on trade and \ntransport infrastructure is a priority area in support of private sector-led development. ADB\u2019s \nCountry Strategy and Program for Tajikistan (2004\u20132008) focuses on promoting economic \ngrowth through (i) rural development and (ii) regional cooperation.  \n \n18.  Trade  facilitation  is  a  strategic  pillar  of  ADB\u2019s  Regional  Cooperation  Strategy  and \nProgram for 2005\u20132007 and the Project is a priority. ADB adopts a three-pronged strategy for \ntrade  facilitation  to  help  (i)  modernize  customs  infrastructure,  including  customs  legal  and \nphysical  infrastructure;  (ii)  develop  customs-supporting  infrastructure  by  fostering  customs \nintermediaries and their associations, such as brokers\u2019 associations; and (iii) support regional \ncustoms cooperation to address issues of common concern and complement country-specific \nsupport. \n \n3.  Lessons Learned \n \n19.  Knowledge-sharing is the main activity of the RTFCCP, particularly in sharing country \nexperience and lessons learned in developing the UAIS according to country circumstances. \nSeveral  forums  focused  on  this  issue,  including  the  August  2003  seminar  in  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic; and the April 2004 conference in the People\u2019s Republic of China. Several customs \nadministrations  in  the  ECAR  have  developed  or  are  planning  to  develop  their  own  UAIS. ", "6  \nNonetheless, lessons learned were gathered not only from ECAR members, but from other \ncountries  and  regions,  such  as  Australia,  the  Philippines,  and  member  countries  of  the \nEuropean Union (EU). \n \n20.   Major  lessons  learned  that  are  reflected  in  the  Project  and  TA  design  include  the \nfollowing: \n \n(i)  Sequencing of modernization and procedure reengineering. At the Customs \nCooperation Committee Seminar held in the Kyrgyz Republic in August 2003, \ncountry  representatives  developed  10  general  principles  for  applying  ICT  to \ncustoms  modernization.9  A  key  principle  is  that  countries  must  first  reform \ncustoms  laws  and  procedures  according  to  country  circumstances  and \ninternational best practices, and then use ICT to reinforce the reform process. \nICT should not be used to reengineer poor and antiquated customs procedures \nin the hope that it will help solve inefficiency, corruption, and other problems. \nADB\u2019s support for customs legal and procedure reforms, followed by support for \ncustoms infrastructure development, is in line with this key lesson learned. \n \n(ii)  Importance  of  compatibility.  The  EU\u2019s  experience  with  integrating  national \nautomated  customs  information  systems  to  develop  the  newly  computerized \ntransit  system  shows  that  no  existing  ICT  system  is  ideal.  One  of  the  key \nattributes of the national systems is that they are compatible with each other and \ncan readily transfer data, taking into consideration international conventions such \nas the Revised Kyoto Convention and common documentation standards such \nas  the  Single  Administrative  Document  administered  by  the  United  Nations \nEconomic Commission for Europe. \n \n(iii)  Phased rollout and development. Customs modernization has high economic \nand  social  benefits,  but  is  a  long-term  and  costly  endeavor.  It  requires \ncomprehensive planning, with prioritization and sequencing of development and \nimplementation. Experience in the Philippines shows that project completion in \ncomputerization does not mean the conclusion of the entire project. In fact, it is \nonly a milestone to mark the start of modernization. Adequate financial support \nmust be provided for following phases of development to upgrade and maintain \nthe system, and keep up the momentum of customs modernization.  \n \n(iv)  Capacity  building  and  human  resource  development.  Human  resource \ndevelopment is essential to maintain the newly developed or adopted system and \nconstantly upgrade and adapt it to the country\u2019s circumstances. Computers are \nonly tools; effective performance depends on the user\u2019s skills. Users must be well \ntrained to maintain and upgrade the system to support the overall efficiency of \ncustoms  operations.  However,  a  key  challenge  is  to  realize  the  benefits  of \ntraining. A major lesson learned from training supported by the EU\u2019s Transport \nCorridor Europe-Caucasus-Asia Program is that training is generally ineffective \nunless  it  is  conducted  with  well-defined  implementation  purposes  and \nmeasurable  outcomes.  The  Project  takes  into  account  this  important  lesson \nlearned by (i) introducing incentives and performance measures to maximize the \nimpact of training, and (ii) ensuring that lower ranking and operations staff are the \n                                                \n9  Summary of  Discussions of the ICT Working Group. Seminar on Trade Facilitation and Customs Modernization, 4-\n8 August 2003, Issyk-Kul, Kyrgyz Republic. Available: http://www.adb.org/Documents/Events/2003/CCC/Trade_ \n  Facilitation_Customs_Modernization/ICT_final_English.pdf. ", "  7\nmain  beneficiaries  of  training.  The  human  resource  policy  will  be  revised, \nsupported by the accompanying TA, to provide incentives for staff to acquire new \nskills to meet the challenge of customs modernization.  \n \n(v)  Change  management  and  public  consultation.  Change  management  and \nconsultation with customs staff and stakeholders (such as traders and brokers) \nare  essential.  Migration  to  automation  is  often  met  with  concerns  because \nautomation is unknown to most customs officers and a manual operation in \ncustoms services is the norm for many developing countries. The benefits of \nautomation must be emphasized and explained, and fears allayed by a dedicated \ngroup\u2014the change management team. \n \n4.  External Assistance and Aid Coordination \n21.  In the Kyrgyz Republic, the International Monetary Fund and United States Agency for \nInternational Development (USAID) have supported customs legal reforms through TA and \nengagement of long-term consultants to help revise the Customs Code in line with the Revised \nKyoto  Convention.  The  EU  through  its  TA  for  the  Commonwealth  of  Independent  States \n(TACIS) has been supporting customs modernization by providing special customs equipment \nand pilot projects on automated data exchange at two customs border posts between the \nKyrgyz Republic and Kazakhstan. The EU\u2019s Eurocustoms has supported training on modern \ncustoms practices. The World Bank provided a small grant to equip the customs headquarters \nwith computers and servers. The Government of the United States also provided funding for \ncustoms equipment and associated training. \n \n22.  In Tajikistan, the International Monetary Fund and World Bank have supported civil \nservice reforms and customs legal reforms through their policy-based and structural adjustment \nprograms.  The  EU,  Swiss  State  Secretariat  for  Economic  Affairs,  and  USAID  have  been \nsupporting revision of the Customs Code and Tax Code, and accession to WTO. USAID has \nprovided consulting services to help develop a strategy and investment plan for modernizing tax \nservices; this complements ADB\u2019s support for developing a strategy and investment plan for \ncustoms modernization. These efforts have helped the Government realize its long-term goal of \nintegrating customs and tax services through ICT. \n \n23.  The Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan governments play the lead role in aid coordination in \ntheir respective countries. The Prime Minister of the Kyrgyz Republic directly oversees the \nprogress of reforms supported by ADB\u2019s program loan, and chairs the Commission for Customs \nReforms and Modernization, comprising representatives from relevant public and private sector \nagencies and major funding agencies. The minister for State Revenues and Duties in Tajikistan \noversees the reform progress, and chairs the Consultative Group for Customs Reforms and \nModernization for interagency consultation. ADB is recognized as the lead institution in support \nof customs reforms and modernization in the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan because of the \ncomprehensive  packages  of  support  extended  and  planned  long-term  engagement  in  the \nsector. Following the support for customs legal reforms through the program loans, the Project \nwill extend a comprehensive package of support combining physical infrastructure development \nwith support for change management, consultation with private sector stakeholders and other \nborder agencies, and capacity building and institutional strengthening. Such comprehensive \nsupport makes the Project unique among the assistance provided by the development partners. \nCompared with the general training on international conventions and modern customs practices \nprovided by other development agencies, training provided under the Project will be conducted \nwith clear implementation purposes and measurable outcomes. Incentives for training will be ", "8  \nprovided through a change in human resource policy, for staff to embrace the opportunities and \nchallenges of customs modernization. The emphasis on behaviorial change and improved staff \ncompetency represents the value-added and niche of the Project in training provided by the \ndevelopment partners. Appendix 4 provides detailed information on external assistance in the \ncustoms area. \n \n5.  Policy Dialogue \n24.  Policy  dialogue  has  been  focusing  on  reform  initiatives  supported  by  the  ongoing \nprogram loans for the two countries, particularly in (i) customs legal reform, and (ii) promotion of \ncustoms intermediaries and their associations. Besides progress in revising the Customs Code, \nthe Kyrgyz Republic adopted a new law on customs intermediaries on 24 June 2004 and the \nTajikistan CSD will facilitate establishment of a brokers\u2019 association in the near future. The \nadoption  of  the  new  customs  codes  provides  the  legal  foundation  for  simplified  customs \nprocedures and their automation. Promotion of customs intermediaries and their association will \nstrengthen the client orientation of customs services and stakeholders\u2019 participation in customs \nmodernization.  \n \n25.  Project sustainability is another focus of policy dialogue. Extensive discussions were \nheld on other countries\u2019 experiences with developing a UAIS so that that the lessons learned \ncould be incorporated in the design of the Project and the accompanying TA. The emphasis on \nchange  management,  human  resource  development,  and  reengineering  of  the  customs \nbusiness process in the Project reflects the lessons learned. Development of the UAIS has high \neconomic and social returns, but also entails significant financial costs, not only for system \ndevelopment, but also for maintenance and upgrading to keep up with technology development. \nTherefore, the Project should be viewed as an initial phase of UAIS development, and its \npriorities should be the core UAIS application systems. To maintain the momentum of customs \nmodernization, the governments are advised (as reflected in the project assurances) to ensure \nadequate budgetary support for maintenance and upgrading, and implementation of the next \nphase of the UAIS in the near future. \n \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Objectives \n26.  The  Project\u2019s  objectives  are  (i)  improved  efficiency  and  transparency  of  customs \nservices,  to  reinforce  the  ongoing  customs  legal  reforms  and  simplification  of  custom \nprocedures; and (ii) trade facilitation and promotion of regional customs cooperation through \nconcerted customs reforms and modernization in the ECAR.  \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n27.  The Project comprises two components each for the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan for \ndevelopment of: (i) the UAIS, and (ii) border-post infrastructure. \n \n1.  Development of the UAIS \n28.  This component consists of three interrelated subcomponents: (i) developing the core \nUAIS  application  systems  and  associated  operation-support  systems;  (ii)  developing \ncommunications infrastructure to support UAIS operation (i.e., providing and strengthening the \ncommunication  links  between  the  CSDs\u2019  headquarters,  regional  customs  offices,  customs ", "  9\nborder posts, and inland clearance points); and (iii) providing training and a public awareness \ncampaign to ensure sustainability and broad-based support for customs modernization efforts. \nThe major components and functions of the UAIS for customs services are given in Appendix 5. \n \na.  Development of Core Application Systems of the UAIS \n29.   This subcomponent consists of (i) establishing the operating environment on which the \ndatabase systems and application software will operate; (ii) installing a database system for the \nmanagement  and  integration  of  various  databases,  and  (iii)  developing  the  core  operation \nsystems of the UAIS, including the (a) core elements of the customs declaration processing \nsystem10 that forms the backbone of the UAIS; (b) operations support systems, such as the \ncustoms intelligence system and WTO valuation system; and (c) selected management support \nsystems, such as human resource management and financial management systems. \n \nb.  Development of Communication Infrastructure \n30.  This involves (i) installing a communications network connecting the CSD headquarters, \nregional offices, and priority customs border posts with associated protocol for communications; \n(ii) providing telecommunications services to connect customs posts with the CSD headquarters \nand regional offices; (iii) installing small-scale local area networks in the regional offices and \npriority border posts; and (iv) upgrading the capacity of the existing wide area network to \nfacilitate  data-sharing  and  communication  with  the  CSDs,  agencies,  and  customs \nadministrations of other countries.  \n \nc.  Human Resource Development and Public Awareness Campaign \n31.  This includes (i) training for customs officers on basic computer skills and applications \nsystems;  (ii)  advanced  training  on  system  administration,  network  management,  systems \ndevelopment,  and  systems  maintenance  and  support;  (iii)  training  on  modern  customs \ntechniques  based  on  risk  management  and  postentry  audit;  and  (iv)  consultation  with \nstakeholders and relevant border agencies to ensure sustainability and broad-based support for \nthe modernization effort and simplification of border procedures through automation. \n \n2.  Border-Post Infrastructure Development \n32.  The second component aims to (i) improve customs border posts and facilities, (ii) \nprovide customs operations and antismuggling equipment, and (iii) extend capacity building and \npromote border interagency cooperation.  \n \na.  Improvement of Customs Border Posts and Facilities11  \n33.  This subcomponent will address inadequate infrastructure for customs operations. It \ncovers (i) construction and rehabilitation of border posts and facilities; and (ii) provision and \nreorganization of border-post facilities to strengthen customs processing capacity and facilitate \ntrade in line with modern customs practices.  \n \n                                                \n10  The customs declaration processing system aims to automate and simplify major customs control procedures for \ntrade movement. The core application systems cover major customs control regimes such as import entry \nprocessing, export processing, and transit movement. \n11 Including inland clearance points and terminals. ", "10  \nb.  Provision of Customs Operations and Antismuggling Equipment  \n34.  Equipment  will  be  provided  for  priority  border  posts  to  enable  customs  officers  to \neffectively undertake their customs control and antismuggling function. Each selected border \npost will be provided with operations and search facilities (e.g., mobile inspection platform, X-ray \nmachines, and detectors). The reduced reliance on manual checks is expected to significantly \nimprove efficiency and effectiveness of customs control. This subcomponent will also include \nacquisition of mobile intervention equipment (e.g., patrol vehicles) to carry out patrols along \nmajor transit routes and the borders. \n \nc.  Capacity Building and Border Interagency Cooperation \n35.  This  subcomponent  includes  provision  of  training  to  customs  officers  on  modern \ncustoms control practices and the use of newly acquired equipment, as well as training on \ninvestigation techniques. In view of the multiple parties involved in trade facilitation and border \ncontrols, this subcomponent will include creation of cooperative partnerships between border \ninspection  agencies  and  traders  to  simplify  border-post  procedures,  and  provide  effective \ncoordination and management of border-post facilities.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n36.  The  Project  has  several  features  relevant  to  thematic  priorities  and  development \napproaches promoted by ADB.  \n \n(i)  First,  the  Project  will  promote  private  sector  participation  in  the  process  of \ncustoms modernization. Consultation with traders and their representatives will \nbe held during project implementation and through existing forums, such as the \nConsultative  Council,  where  customs  and  private  sector  stakeholders  meet \nregularly to exchange views and discuss major nontrade barriers and customs \nregulatory  issues.  Such  public-private  partnerships  will  enhance  the  client \norientation of customs services.  \n(ii)  Second, change management, human resource development, and institutional \nstrengthening are key components of the Project and accompanying TA. These \nefforts  will  ensure  that  the  organizational  structure  and  personnel  policy  are \ncompatible with automation, and customs modernization is broadly supported by \ncommensurate development in staff capacity.  \n(iii)  Third, the Project presents a unique opportunity to deepen regional customs \ncooperation under the RTFCCP. The CSDs of the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan \nwill  establish  a  joint  working  group  for  regular  consultation  and  project \nimplementation. Other countries joining the RTFCCP have already expressed \ninterest in sharing their knowledge on UAIS development and offering advice on \nfunctional and technical specifications of the UAIS. The Project will also offer an \nopportunity to broaden knowledge sharing and customs modernization in areas \nsuch as change management.  \n(iv)  Fourth,  the  Project  will  complement  ADB\u2019s  transport  facilitation  initiatives  by \nimproving border posts and the inland clearance points along ADB-financed road \nprojects in the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan.  \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n37.  The total project cost is estimated at $22.75 million equivalent. The Kyrgyz component is \nestimated to cost $9.37 million equivalent (foreign exchange cost of $4.83 million and local ", " 11\ncurrency cost of $4.54 million equivalent), and the Tajikistan component is estimated to cost \n$13.38 million equivalent (foreign exchange cost of $8.42 million and local currency cost of \n$4.96 million equivalent). The costs are summarized in Table 1 and in Appendix 6.

Financing Plan \n38.  The financing plan for the Project is summarized in Table 2 and detailed in Appendix 6. \nThe Government of the Kyrgyz Republic has requested a loan of $7.5 million equivalent in \nSpecial Drawing Rights and the Government of Tajikistan has requested a loan of $10.7 million \nequivalent in Special Drawing Rights from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the \nProject. The loans will have an amortization period of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 \nyears, with an interest charge of 1% per year on principal amount disbursed during the grace \nperiod, and 1.5% per year during the remaining amortization period.  \n \n39.  For the Kyrgyz component, the loan will finance 80% of the total project cost including \nthe full amount of the foreign exchange cost estimated at $4.83 million, and about 59% of the \nlocal currency cost estimated at $2.67 million. For the Tajikistan component, the loan will ", "12  \nfinance 80% of the total project cost including the full amount of the foreign exchange cost \nestimated at $8.42 million, and about 46% of the local currency cost estimated at $2.28 million. \nThe remaining $1.87 million equivalent for the Kyrgyz Republic and $2.68 million for Tajikistan \nwill  be  provided  by  the  respective  governments  as  counterpart  financing.  The  counterpart \nsupport includes taxes and duties, part of the civil works for both countries, and part of training \ncosts for Tajikistan.  \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \n  Foreign  Local  Total   \nSource  Exchange  Currency  Cost  Percent \nKyrgyz Republic         \nADB  4.83  2.67  7.50  80 \nGovernment  0.00  1.87  1.87  20 \n      Total  4.83  4.54  9.37  100 \n         \nTajikistan         \nADB  8.42  2.28  10.70  80 \nGovernment  0.00  2.68  2.68  20 \n      Total  8.42  4.96  13.38  100 \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n40.  Executing and Implementing Agencies. For the Kyrgyz component, the Ministry of \nFinance (MOF) will be the Executing Agency (EA), and the Committee for Revenues under \nMOF, will be the Implementing Agency. For the Tajikistan component, the Ministry of State \nRevenues and Duties (MSRD) will be the EA, and MSRD\u2019s CSD will be the Implementing \nAgency. The EAs will have overall responsibility for the implementation of project activities. The \norganization charts for the EAs are in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n41.  Project  Steering  Committee.  Each  EA  will  establish  a  project  steering  committee \n(PSC)  before  or  immediately  after  loan  effectiveness  to  guide  the  overall  direction  and \ncoordinate issues related to project implementation. In the Kyrgyz Republic, the PSC will be \nheaded by the chair of MOF\u2019s Committee for Revenues and include the CSD head and a deputy \nhead. In Tajikistan, the PSC will be chaired by the MSRD minister and include the CSD head \nand deputy head. Other PSC members may include relevant ministries and agencies (such as \nthe  drug  control  agency)  and  private  sector  stakeholders.  The  PSCs  will  also  serve  as \nmechanisms for private sector participation in customs modernization. This is in addition to the \nconsultative  councils  existing  in  the  two  countries  where  customs  and  private  sector \nstakeholders meet regularly to discuss customs-related issues and address major nontrade \nbarriers facing traders and their representatives. The PSCs will meet twice a year or as needed. \n \n42.  Management. The chair of the Committee for Revenues in the Kyrgyz Republic and the \nMSRD minister in Tajikistan will be the project directors with overall responsibility for project \nmanagement. The respective project director will appoint a senior CSD staff member as deputy \nproject director. To oversee day-to-day project implementation, a full-time project management \noffice (PMO) will be set up within the Committee for Revenues for the Kyrgyz project component \nand the CSD for the Tajikistan project component. The PMO will be headed by a qualified PMO ", " 13\ndirector and deputy director selected on a competitive basis, acceptable to ADB. The PMO \ndirector will be assisted by a group of qualified technical and administrative specialists who may \ninclude loan finance officer/accountant, procurement specialist, ICT and training specialists, \ncustoms infrastructure specialist, and office manager and interpreter. Such staff will be selected \nby the Government on a competitive basis. The PMO will remain adequately staffed throughout \nproject implementation and be assisted by international and domestic consultants financed \nunder the loan and the accompanying TA. The PMO will have the following responsibilities: (i) \nplanning and scheduling of project activities; (ii) administration of procurement activities and \nselection of consultants; (iii) bookkeeping and maintenance of project accounts, and preparation \nand consolidation of liquidation reports; (iv) supervision and monitoring of the work program and \nproject performance; (v) coordination of field activities; (vi) engagement of consultants or firms \nto  conduct  audits  of  the  project  account  and  financial  statements;  (vii)  liaison  with  ADB, \nconcerned Government agencies, and private sector stakeholders; and (viii) preparation of \nquarterly and annual project monitoring and progress reports. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n43.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  in  5  years  starting  in  January  2005.  The  project \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 7.  \n \n3.  Procurement \n44.  The PMO will be responsible for procurement of all equipment, services, and civil works \nfinanced under the Project. All services, supplies, and equipment to be financed by ADB will be \nprocured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Equipment and materials for \npackages  valued  at  $500,000  or  more  will  be  procured  through  international  competitive \nbidding. Supply contracts and specialized items estimated to cost less than $500,000 will be \nprocured  using  international  shopping.  Minor  items  of  equipment  and  materials  costing \n$100,000 or less will be procured through direct purchase. \n \n45.  Civil works contracts estimated at $1 million equivalent or more will be carried out by \nprequalified contractors using international competitive bidding, while those valued below $1 \nmillion equivalent will be carried out using local competitive bidding procedures acceptable to \nADB.  Civil  works  will  be  required  to  install  ICT  equipment  and  develop  border-post \ninfrastructure. If the civil works\u2019 size, nature, and location make them unsuitable for competitive \nbidding, and if the EA has the facilities and capacity to implement them expeditiously and at a \nreasonable cost, then ADB may agree to force account procedures. Force account will be \napplied to civil works related to border-post infrastructure development, and will have an upper \nlimit for a package of $50,000. The award of all civil works contracts will be subject to ADB \napproval. The indicative list of contract packages is in Appendix 8. The EAs were advised of the \nneed to maintain transparency and accountability in procuring goods and services, as required \nunder ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy.  \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n46.  The  Project  will  finance  international  and  domestic  consulting  services  for  project \nimplementation. The terms of reference for the consulting services include systems analysis and \ndesign (technical specifications, hardware and software strategy), systems development and \nintegration, systems implementation, and project management advice. About 20 person-months \nof international and 45 person-months of domestic consulting services will be required for the \nKyrgyz Republic, while 24 person-months of international and 52 person-months of domestic \nconsulting services will be required for Tajikistan. The terms of reference for the consulting ", "14  \nservices are in Appendix 9. The consultants will be engaged either as individuals, and/or \nconsulting firm(s) of international consultants with domestic associates to be selected following \nthe quality- and cost-based selection method, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants. The CSDs and ADB have agreed that most of the consultants will be hired \nthrough  a  firm.  Domestic  consultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with \narrangements satisfactory to ADB. Advance recruitment of consultants will be undertaken in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The advance action includes \nfinalizing the terms of reference and evaluation criteria, identifying suitable candidates, and \nranking the candidates and submitting their names and qualifications for ADB approval, together \nwith the draft contract for the negotiation. The governments were informed that approval of \nadvance action does not commit ADB to finance the Project or to finance the recruitment costs.  \n \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements  \n47.  The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook. To expedite project implementation through timely release of loan proceeds, the \ngovernments will each establish an imprest account promptly after loan effectiveness with an \ninitial deposit of $500,000 equivalent from loan proceeds. The ceiling of total advances at any \ntime is not to exceed the estimated expenditures for the next 6 months or 10% of the loan \namount, whichever is lower. The imprest account will be established at a bank acceptable to \nADB, and will be managed and liquidated in accordance with detailed arrangements agreed on \nby the implementing agencies and ADB, consistent with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. \nStatement of expenditure (SOE) procedures will be used to reimburse, liquidate, and replenish \nthe  imprest  account  for  eligible  expenditures  not  exceeding  $20,000  per  payment.  Force \naccount procedures will be used to reimburse expenditures for civil works involving the use of \nthe EAs\u2019 work force, equipment, and other resources. ADB reserves the right to conduct spot or \nrandom  checks  of  expenditures  covered  by  SOE.  Notwithstanding  the  Government\u2019s  own \ndisbursement  procedures,  sufficient  supporting  documentation,  as  defined  in  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook, must be kept to substantiate all expenditures incurred from the loan \nproceeds. \n \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n48.  In view of the governments\u2019 inadequate financial management capacity, the PMOs will \nmaintain separate accounts exclusively for the Project and will register in such accounts all \nreceipts and payments for the Project. Each PMO will include a loan finance officer/accountant \nto ensure that the Project is managed according to sound accounting principles and procedures. \nThe accounts and financial statements for each fiscal year, including the imprest account and \nSOE records, will be audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to ADB. The audit \nreport will include a statement verifying that the loan disbursed by ADB against the SOEs is \nused for the purposes for which the loan is provided. The implementing agencies will provide \nADB with an audit report, together with audited accounts and financial statements within 6 \nmonths after the end of each fiscal year. Both the financial statements and auditor\u2019s report will \nbe in English. The implementing agencies were informed of ADB\u2019s policy on submission of \naudited accounts. If the delay in submitting financial statement is more than 6 months, ADB will \nnot issue a commitment letter and may not approve new contract awards. If the delay is more \nthan 12 months, loan disbursements may be suspended or the loan may be canceled. \n \n49.  To ensure effective implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the Project will be \ncontinuous, with timely reporting. The PMO will submit brief quarterly and annual reports to \nADB, indicating progress made and problems encountered during the review period, steps \ntaken or proposed to be taken to remedy the problems, proposed program of activities, and ", " 15\nexpected progress during the following period. Within 3 months of physical project completion, \nthe EAs will submit to ADB a completion report providing details about implementation, costs, \nbenefits, and other information requested by ADB. \n \n7.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n50.  The  implementing  agencies  will  each  establish  an  appropriate  project  performance \nmanagement system in the PMO within 1 year of effectiveness. For periodic monitoring, key \nindicators and baseline conditions will be developed through surveys and incorporated in the \nregular reporting system. The implementing agencies and ADB have agreed on a preliminary \nset of project performance indicators, which are incorporated in the Project Framework. Project \nmonitoring and evaluation reports will be submitted to ADB on a quarterly basis. On project \ncompletion, the impacts of the Project will be evaluated according to a schedule and terms of \nreference agreed upon by the EAs and ADB. \n \n8.  Project Review \n51.  The EAs and ADB will jointly review the Project at least twice during the first year of \nproject implementation and at least once a year thereafter, and will monitor overall performance \nof the PMO. After 3 years of implementation, a comprehensive midterm review of the Project will \nbe  carried  out  jointly  by  the  EAs  and  ADB,  to  identify  any  problems  and  constraints \nencountered,  and  assess  the  need  for  midterm  modification  of  the  project  scope  and \nimplementation  arrangements.  Technical  and  budgetary  changes  to  the  project  document \nrequested or arising from the review will also be considered, as will be the inclusion of additional \nactivities  or  the  consideration  of  possible  expansion  of  activities/areas  over  the  remaining \nproject life. \n \n9.  Anticorruption Policy \n52.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to the EAs. Attention was drawn to the \nsection on fraud and corruption in ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants. ADB emphasized that ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy requires borrowers (including \nbeneficiaries of ADB loans), as well as consultants, bidders, suppliers, and contractors under \nADB-financed contracts, to observe the highest standards of ethics during the recruitment, \nprocurement, and execution of such contracts; and that sanctions as per the guidelines, would \nbe taken if fraud and corruption were discovered. The EAs are committed to creating corruption-\nfree  environments  and  would  like  the  Project  to  be  implemented  strictly  following  ADB\u2019s \nguidelines.  \n \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE  \nA.  Objectives and Scope \n53.  An accompanying grant-financed TA will be provided to each of the Kyrgyz Republic and \nTajikistan12  to  ensure  that  (i)  customs  modernization  through  automation  and  border-post \ninfrastructure  development  is  supported  by  the  institutional  structure  and  the  business \nprocesses of the two countries\u2019 CSDs, and that (ii) the UAIS and border-post infrastructure \ndevelopment are carried out with sound supervision and quality assurance. Each TA consists of \n                                                \n12 The TA for Tajikistan was first listed in the ADB Business Opportunities (ADBBO) (Internet version) on 31 March \n2004 and the TA for the Kyrgyz Republic was listed in the ADBBO on 9 July 2004.  ", "16  \nthree  components:  (i)  change  management  and  public-private  partnership  for  customs \nmodernization, (ii) reengineering of customs business processes, and (iii) quality and security \nassurance of the UAIS and border-post infrastructure development. Appendix 10 includes cost \nestimates and outline terms of reference for consultants. \n \n54.  Change Management and Public-Private Partnership. This component will ensure \nthat the customs administration\u2019s organizational structure and human resource policy support \nthe customs modernization efforts, and that the potential impact of customs modernization on \nthe organizational structure and staff employment is properly explained and fears are allayed. \nTherefore, the main task under this component is to review the organizational structure and \nhuman resource policy (including in-house training capacity) and propose necessary changes to \nsupport  the  customs  modernization  efforts.  It  will  support  the  integration  of  all  the  project \ncomponents  to  develop  a  master  plan  and  maximize  the  development  impact  of  customs \nmodernization.  The  component  will  also  support  (i)  consultation  with  traders  and  their \nrepresentatives to ensure stakeholders\u2019 participation and support, and (ii) design and conduct of \na survey of pilot border posts to provide the benchmarks and inputs for the project performance \nmanagement system and project evaluation. \n \n55.  Reengineering of Customs Business Processes. This component will help ensure \nthat customs practices and procedures are in line with the Revised Customs Code, Revised \nKyoto Convention, and customs-related WTO agreements; and that automation and procedural \nchanges reinforce each other. The TA will support the review of all customs control procedures \nand documentation, and provide inputs for design of the UAIS. \n \n56.  Quality and Security Assurance. The TAs will support an ICT systems development \naudit  to  establish  quality  and  security  assurance  for  the  systems  development  plan  and \nimplementation,  and  the  security  aspects  to  cover  all  the  components  of  the  UAIS  (e.g., \ndatabases, data transfers, services, workstations). This component will also provide for quality \naspects and supervision for civil works and border infrastructure equipment. \n \nB.  Costs Estimates and Financing Plan \n57.  The cost of each of the TAs for the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan is estimated at \n$600,000 equivalent, including $400,000 in foreign exchange cost and $200,000 equivalent in \nlocal currency. ADB will provide, on a grant basis, $500,000 each to the Kyrgyz Republic and \nTajikistan from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan, to finance the \nentire  foreign  exchange  costs  and  $100,000  equivalent  of  local  currency  costs.  Each \ngovernment\u2019s contribution of $100,000 will cover office accommodations, provision of support \nstaff, local communication, and logistic support for workshops and seminars. \n  \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n58.  For  the  Kyrgyz  TA,  MOF  will  be  the  EA,  and  the  Committee  for  Revenues  the \nImplementing Agency. For the Tajikistan TA, MSRD will be the EA, and CSD the Implementing \nAgency. The TAs will commence in January 2005 and be completed by December 2007 in order \nto support project implementation. The PSCs will be charged with overseeing government \ncoordination, and providing timely guidance and management support to the respective TAs. All \nequipment  to  be  purchased  under  the  TAs  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  Procurement.  An  advance  payment  facility  will  be  established,  as \nworkshops/training/seminars require funds prior to the conduct of the events. \n ", " 17\n59.  The TAs will finance 14 person-months of international consulting in the Kyrgyz Republic \nand 12 person-months in Tajikistan, and 58 person-months of domestic consulting for each \ncountry. The proposed international and domestic consultants include specialists in (i) customs \nmodernization and change management (2 person-months international and 10 person-months \ndomestic  for  each  country),  (ii)  customs  automation  and  procedures  (8  person-months \ninternational for the Kyrgyz Republic and 6 person-months international for Tajikistan; and 24 \nperson-months domestic for each country), (iii) ICT quality and security assurance (4 person-\nmonths international and 18 person-months domestic for each country), and (iv) civil works and \nconstruction  supervision  (6  person-months  domestic  for  each  country).  The  breakdown  of \nconsulting requirements is indicative and subject to change at the consultant selection stage.  \n \n60.  In  consultation  with  the  EAs,  ADB  will  engage  qualified  firm(s)  of  international \nconsultants with domestic associates and additional individual consultants as necessary to \nprovide services in accordance with the terms of reference using the quality- and cost-based \nselection method, following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. The consultants will work \nclosely with the respective implementing agency, relevant agencies and institutions, the project \nPMO, private sector stakeholders, and ADB staff. \n \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n61.  The project benefits include \n \n(i)  trade  facilitation  and  enhanced  revenue  collection  by  simplifying  procedures, \nautomating customs declaration, and introducing modern customs controls based \non risk management and postentry audit; \n(ii)  prevention  of  smuggling  and  drug  trafficking  by  developing  an  ICT-based \nintelligence system and enhanced exchange of information between customs \nheadquarters and border posts, and cooperation between border agencies; \n(iii)  reduced  corruption  and  improved  governance  practices  by  improving \ntransparency  of  customs  services,  and  minimizing  direct  interfaces  between \ncustoms officers and traders and their representatives; \n(iv)  support  for  regional  customs  cooperation  by  promoting  concerted  customs \nreforms and modernization essential for improving regional trading environment, \nand providing the ICT infrastructure to address issues of common concern, such \nas transit development and data sharing; and \n(v)  strengthened  human  resource  management  and  institutional  capacity  by \nintroducing  a  management  information  system,  and  modern  accounting  and \nfinancial management practices. \n \nA.  Economic Analysis \n62.  The Project is expected to have an economic internal rate of return of 21.50% for the \nKyrgyz component and 23.34% for the Tajikistan component. The Project will have a positive \nimpact on the overall economic development of the two countries because trade is an engine for \ngrowth, and modernization of customs services is key for facilitating trade and improving the \nenabling  environment  for  foreign  direct  investment  and  private  sector-led  economic \ndevelopment. The main benefits that accrue to the Project include (i) economic benefits from \nimproved trade and associated economic growth and employment generation; and (ii) reduced \ntransaction  costs  due  to  enhanced  customs  integrity  and  reduced  waiting  times  at  border \ncrossings and inland clearance points. The Project is expected to reduce transaction costs for ", "18  \ntrade in two ways: (i) efficiency gain by automating customs services and improving border \nclearance facilities, and (ii) reduced corruption by minimizing direct interfaces between customs \nofficers and traders and their representatives. Other nonquantifiable benefits include improved \ninstitutional capacity of the customs administration, strengthened regional customs cooperation, \nand improved transit and investment conditions in the ECAR. \n \n63.  The fiscal impact of the Project is expected to be positive. Improvement in the overall \nefficiency of customs services, enhanced customs integrity, more selective approach to customs \ncontrols based on risk management, and stronger enforcement capacity will enable the CSDs to \nboth expand the official volume of trade and deter underreporting and undervaluation. Increased \ntrade volume through formal channels will boost the CSDs\u2019 revenue collection. Automation will \nimprove transparency and reduce corruption by minimizing direct interfaces between customs \nofficers and traders and their representatives. Enhanced customs integrity reduces revenue \nleakage resulting from smuggling and undervaluation. The introduction of a risk management \nsystem under the Project will result in an increased rate of detection of smuggling and drug \ntrafficking. All these project outcomes will enhance the CSDs\u2019 revenue collection and contribute \nto  sound  fiscal  management  for  poverty  reduction  and  provision  of  social  services.  The \neconomic and financial analyses are included in Appendix 11. \n \nB.  Regional Benefits \n64.  The Project will have a positive regional impact by (i) improving transit conditions of the \ntwo countries that will greatly facilitate trade of neighboring countries, and (ii) contributing to an \nimproved  overall  trading  and  investment  environment  in  the  ECAR  through  strengthened \nregional customs cooperation.  \n \n65.  Transit development for international trade is vital for ECAR member countries because \nof their small-economies and land-locked natures. They depend on each other to trade within \nthe ECAR as well as with major trading partners in the rest of the world. Automation coupled \nwith improved border facilities and customs integrity will strengthen the national transit systems \nand improve the transit conditions in the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan. Further improvement in \nthe  regional  transit  conditions  requires  active  cooperation  of  ECAR  member  countries  to \nestablish a viable regional transit arrangement. Development of a regional transit arrangement \nsupported by computerized national transit systems is a major initiative of the RTFCCP under \nthe CAREC Program. However, progress has been slow because of significant disparity in the \ncustoms infrastructure conditions of the member countries. Several member countries including \nthe Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan do not have a unified automated information system to \nsupport their national transit systems and allow timely sharing of customs data and intelligence \ninformation for transit control. The Project will help the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan to catch \nup  with  customs  infrastructure  development  of  the  neighboring  countries  and  effectively \nparticipate in the development of a regional transit arrangement. Through faster and more \neffective data sharing, the Project will also help implementation of the transit agreement recently \nsigned  between  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Kazakhstan,  and  a  proposed  transit  agreement \nbetween the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan expected to be signed by the end of 2004. \n \nC.  Social and Poverty Impact \n66.  The poor will benefit from employment generated from enhanced trade and foreign direct \ninvestment. Reduced transaction costs make trade in small volumes possible and therefore \ndirectly benefits the poor and small traders. Civil work for border-post development financed by \nthe Project will directly benefit the poor through employment. The poor will also benefit from the \nCSDs\u2019 greater revenue contribution to the governments\u2019 budget. Customs revenue collection ", " 19\nrepresents a significant percentage of the governments\u2019 budget (currently estimated at around \n35%). Adequate revenue collection is the key for sound fiscal management for poverty reduction \nand sustainable economic development. The Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy \nis in Appendix 12. \n \nD.  Environmental Impact  \n67.  ADB has classified the Project in environmental category C based on the site visits and \nassessment under the project preparatory TAs. Site visits were made to the regional customs \noffices and border posts to examine the infrastructure development requirements. Construction \nand civil works will be required at the border posts and inland clearance points selected for the \nProject for establishing permanent customs structures, reorganization of border-post facilities, \nand installation of equipment for the development of communications networks. Some of the \nmore remote locations will also require generators because they either have no main electricity \nor the supply is unreliable. All construction, rehabilitation, and installation activities will be \ncarried out within the premises of the existing customs properties, which are located at the side \nof existing road and rail structures. No land acquisition or resettlement is required.  \n \n68.  During  construction  some  minor  noise  and  dust  pollution  will  occur;  most  will  be \ncontained within existing structures. The civil work contracts will include mitigating measures to \nminimize such pollution. Therefore, the environmental impact of the Project is minimal and can \nbe kept to acceptable levels by implementing mitigation measures in the civil works contracts. \nThe environmental analysis is included in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \nE.  Project Risks  \n69.  The governments are fully committed to customs modernization and trade facilitation, \nwhich mitigates the risk of lack of political commitment. The adoption of the revised Customs \nCode in the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan\u2019s firm commitment to WTO accession and to revise \nthe  Customs  Code  provide  the  legal  foundation  for  simplifying  and  automating  customs \nprocedures. Project-specific risks may include (i) lack of commitment to change management, \nand resistance from vested interest groups that benefit from lack of transparency and inefficient \ncustoms clearance systems; (ii) lack of consultation and cooperation with the trade community \nand relevant government agencies, (iii) the implementing agencies\u2019 difficulty to recruit and retain \ncompetent  and  experienced  information  technology  personnel,  and  (iv)  inadequate  budget \nprovision for maintenance and following phases of customs modernization. These risks are \nmitigated by ongoing measures adopted by the two countries\u2019 EAs, the project and TA design, \nand government assurances.  \n \n70.  Both  EAs  fully  embrace  change  management  as  a  key  component  for  customs \nmodernization to ensure broad-based support and manage resistance from vested interest \ngroups  benefiting  from  lack  of  transparency  and  inefficient  customs  services.  Senior \nmanagement of the two EAs are firmly committed to customs modernization, and accountability \nof a team dedicated to customs modernization and project implementation. Strong emphasis \nhas also been given to consultation with private sector stakeholders through both the existing \nmechanism and a new mechanism introduced under the Project.  \n \n71.  Reorganization is already ongoing to prepare for customs modernization. In the Kyrgyz \nRepublic,  the  division  in  charge  of  customs  automation  was  recently  expanded  into  a \ndepartment with an increase in staff positions. In Tajikistan, the division, Programming and \nSystem  Development,  has  been  established  within  the  department  in  charge  of  customs \nautomation. This has resulted in an increase in staff positions in the department. The Project ", "20  \noffers  an  opportunity  to  attract  qualified  ICT  specialists  to  join  the  customs  modernization \nefforts. The EAs will give special attention to staff retention, especially for specialists who join \nproject implementation.  \n \n72.  The  potential  counterpart  fund  risk  has  been  mitigated  by  the  governments\u2019  strong \nsupport for the Project and their assurances. The MOFs of both countries assured ADB that \nadequate counterpart funds will be provided during project implementation and requested their \nrespective implementing agencies to submit a proposal for the counterpart funds. Adequate \nfunding for maintenance and expansion of customs modernization is expected to be available \nbeyond the implementation period with the MOFs\u2019 assurance of supporting following phases of \ncustoms automation and border-post infrastructure development.  \n \n73.  The potential risk of project delay could be due to (i) inadequate attention to planning \nand  (ii)  lack  of  experience  with  ADB\u2019s  project  implementation  procedures.  The  former  is \nmitigated by the governments\u2019 assurance to set up a working group before loan negotiations to \nprepare a master plan for project implementation, and the latter will be mitigated by intensive \ntraining on project implementation and support from ADB review missions. \n \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n74.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Kyrgyz and Tajikistan governments have \ngiven the following assurances, which are incorporated in the respective legal documents. \n \n(i)  The Government will ensure that Working Group comprising EA and CSD staff \nwill  prepare  master  plan  for  the  development  of  the  UAIS  and  border-post \ninfrastructure. The master plan will be completed during the first year of project \nimplementation.  The  master  plan  for  the  UAIS  will  include  functional  and \ntechnical specifications, priority and sequencing of the development of various \napplication  systems  for  the  UAIS,  piloting  testing,  change  management, \nconsultation, and training measures. \n \n(ii)  The  Government  will  establish  a  PSC  to  consult  with  relevant  government \nagencies  and  private  sector  stakeholders  before  or  immediately  after  loan \neffectiveness. \n \n(iii)  The Government will ensure that the EA implements the training plan (as part of \nthe master plan). \n \n(iv)  The Government will ensure that during project implementation (a) CSD prepares \nan operation plan indicating counterpart fund requirements for the following year, \nand (b) MOF allocates and disburses necessary counterpart funds on a timely \nbasis. \n \n(v)  The Government will ensure that the EA conducts an independent audit on the \nproject account and financial statement within 6 months after the close of each \nfiscal year during project implementation. \n ", " 21\n(vi)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  EA  establishes  a  project  performance \nmanagement  system  with  assistance  of  consultants  within  1  year  from  the \ncommencement of project implementation.  \n \n(vii)  By the end of year 3 of project implementation, the Government will ensure the \ndevelopment of an investment plan for upgrading the UAIS and customs border-\npost infrastructure.  \n \nB.  Condition for Loan Disbursement \n75.  The Government agreed to the following condition for withdrawal of loan proceeds, \nwhich  is  incorporated  in  the  Loan  Agreement:  establishment  of  the  PMO  in  a  manner \nsatisfactory to ADB. \n \n \nVII.

Kyrgyz Republic \n1.  Economic Development \n1  Real gross domestic product (GDP) grew at 6.7% in 2003, the highest growth rate since \nthe Russian financial crisis in 1998, which brought an economic slowdown to all of Central Asia. \nEconomic rebound was broad-based, led by not only recovery in gold production, but also \nnongold industrial production, such as electricity generation, food processing, chemicals, and \nnonmetallic products. The service sector grew at 5.8%, the highest rate for the past decade. \nDeregulation  and  steady  growth  in  tourism  was  attributable  to  the  growth.  However,  the \nagriculture  sector  grew  at  only  3.8%  due  to  unfavorable  weather.  Inflation  continued  its \ndownward trend in 2003, growing at 3% compared with 3.7% in 2002 and 9.6% in 2001. \n \n2  The fiscal deficit decreased by 0.4% to 5.0% of GDP in 2003. It was, however, higher \nthan targeted due to the unanticipated spending on disaster relief and emergency rehabilitation. \nTotal tax and duty revenues increased by 0.8% of GDP to 18.7% of GDP in 2003 because of \nimproved tax and duty collection. The value-added tax (VAT) was introduced on large farms in \nApril 2003. Property tax legislation was approved and is likely to be introduced in 2005 after \nagreements on valuation and exemption limits. Excise duties on petroleum fuels were cut by \n50% resulting in a sharp fall in smuggling and a rise in revenue.  \n \n3.  The Government maintained prudent fiscal policy in 2003 as part of its debt reduction \nstrategy. As a result, public investment fell to 3.6% of GDP in 2003 from 4.7% in the previous \nyear. The debt-servicing burden eased as the Government successfully negotiated with the \nmajority of bilateral creditors following the understandings reached in the Paris Club in March \n2002. The understandings with the Paris Club creditors include a goodwill clause that the \ncountry may be able to secure still more debt restructuring, including substantial reduction of \ndebt  outstanding  provided  that  the  ongoing  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Facility  is \nsuccessfully completed. \n \n4.  The trade deficit increased in 2003 to $82.7 million. This was due to strong imports and \nreduced smuggling of oil products resulting from the success of the excise tax reform. During \n1993\u20132003, exports increased from $340 million to $580 million, while imports increased from \n$448  million  to  $717  million.  In  2003,  exports  accounted  for  30%  of  GDP,  while  imports \naccounted  for  37%.  Approximately  50%  of  imports  come  from  the  Russian  Federation, \nKazakhstan, and Uzbekistan. The Russian Federation and Central Asian countries are also \nmajor destinations of Kyrgyz exports.  \n \n2.  Customs Administration \n5.  Established in 1991, the customs administration has a decade of experience in customs \nservices.  The  Customs  Services  Department  (CSD)  is  placed  under  the  Committee  for \nRevenues of the Ministry of Finance, along with the Tax Department. CSD employs about 1,270 \nofficers working in the headquarters, regional offices, and border posts. There are 15 customs \nregions  and  65  border  crossing  points  (of  which  4  are  railways).  CSD  processed  70,000 \ndeclarations  in  2002  consisting  of  45,974  imports  and  23,765  exports  declarations.  These \nfigures only relate to freight traffic and exclude personal declarations such as those made by \npassengers at the airports and border posts. \n  ", "  Appendix 2  27 \n6.  Customs Legal Framework. A major change in the Customs Code was introduced in \nDecember 1998 as part of the country\u2019s effort to join the World Trade Organization (WTO). \nFurther revision has been made in the past few years in an effort to streamline customs \nregulations and adopt modern customs practices based on risk management and postentry \naudit. The revised Customs Code was adopted on 13 April 2004. Parliament ratified a separate \nlaw on customs licensing on 24 June 2004 to stipulate the legal status and regulation of \ncustoms intermediaries. Currently, only the so-called infrastructure staff, originally hired and \ntrained by CSD, have the authority to prepare declarations and act as obligatory intermediaries \nbetween importers and CSD. They also operate bonded warehouses and clearance sheds, for \nwhich they charge fees, and are responsible for the sale of unclaimed goods.  \n \n7.  Customs  Control.  The  approach  to  clearance  and  general  customs  operations \ndemonstrate CSD\u2019s commitment to customs modernization:  \n \n(i)  WTO\u2019s valuation system is in force. \n(ii)  CSD  has  introduced  the  Single  Administrative  Document  as  the  standard \ndeclaration  form,  which  unifies  all  customs  documents  in  the  Central  Asian \ncountries. \n(iii)  Data  is  shared  with  the  Tax  Department  for  VAT  control  purposes,  and  a \ntaxpayer identification number issued by the Tax Department is in use. \n(iv)  The concept of selectivity for physical examinations is fully understood in CSD \nheadquarters, and \u201cgreen corridors\u201d are introduced at selected border posts to \nallow  approved  importers  to  be  entitled  to  simplified  procedures,  such  as \naccelerated border processing and deferred payment of duty (subject to 0.3% \ninterest), and direct clearance on the premises of importers is envisaged. \n(v)  A streamlined system for settling out of court minor customs violations is used. \n \n8.  Revenue Collection. CSD collects customs duty, excise tax, and VAT on international \ntrade. The contribution of customs revenues to the fiscal budget has been rising, currently \naccounting  for  over  one  third  of  all  revenues.  During  2000\u20132003,  total  customs  revenue \ncollections increased by more than 100% in dollar terms. In 2003, CSD contributed $114 million \nto the Government budget. The efficient collection of revenue by CSD is critical to the national \neconomy and to poverty reduction and other social sector programs.  \n \n9.  In addition to CSD acting as a revenue collection agency on behalf of the Government, it \nis authorized to collect fees on transaction charges based on 0.15% of import value. The \nrevenue generated from such fees is insufficient to cover overall CSD expenditure and therefore \nthe Ministry of Finance provides a budget allocation of about $1 million per annum. Of the \nrevenue from the fee collection and budget provision, approximately two thirds is spent on staff \nremuneration.  Of  the  remainder,  half  is  spent  on  equipment  and  a  mere  3%  on  building \nmaintenance. The remaining fund is insufficient for major customs infrastructure undertaking.  \n \n10.  Information and Communication Technology Infrastructure Conditions. CSD does \nnot have the core customs application systems and adequate communications infrastructure to \nautomate  customs  services  and  support  modern  customs  control  practices  based  on  risk \nmanagement  as  promulgated  in  the  revised  Customs  Code.  Communication  within  the \nheadquarters is provided by a corporate local area network. The connection of computers and \nprinters via dual servers enables E-mail and limited Internet access.  \n \n11.  Communication  between  regional  CSD  offices  and  headquarters  is  through  the \nGovernment\u2019s  wide  area  network,  which  cannot  accommodate  the  growing  volume  of ", "28  Appendix 2 \ninformation flow and performs poorly. None of the border posts have communications facilities \nresulting in delayed submission of customs statistics to headquarters.  \n \n12.  Regional Customs Cooperation. The Kyrgyz Republic is a member of the Eurasian \nEconomic Community, which includes Belarus, Kazakhstan, Russian Federation, and Tajikistan. \nIt was created in 2000 to promote trade and economic cooperation among the members within \nthe framework of a customs union. From the beginning, the countries agreed to remove all \ntariffs and nontariff barriers among the members and to keep external tariffs low. At the annual \nmeeting held in May 2003 in Dushanbe, Tajikistan, members agreed to have a similar tariff \nstructure for external trade rather than a common external tariff in view of varied stages in WTO \naccession. The objective of having a common external tariff is now deferred to 2010.  \n \n13.  The Kyrgyz CSD is a member of the ADB-sponsored Regional Customs Cooperation \nProgram for East and Central Asia consisting of seven other countries. The program provides a \nforum for the Kyrgyz CSD to advance a number of bilateral initiatives to improve regional transit \nconditions, share customs information, and pilot test joint customs processing. The Kyrgyz \nRepublic entered into a transit agreement with Kazakhstan on 26 March 2004, and initiated joint \nborder processing with Kazakhstan at one border post effective July 2004. Sponsored by ADB, \nthe customs administrations of the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan conducted two rounds of \nconsultation on a draft transit agreement in June and August 2004, and both parties agreed to \nreconvene soon to finalize the draft agreement. The Kyrgyz CSD has also made progress in \ndeveloping  an  agreement  on  data  sharing  with  the  customs  department  of  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China. \n \nB.   Tajikistan \n1.  Economic Development \n14.  Economic development remained buoyant in 2003, growing at a brisk pace of 10.2% \ncompared with 9.1% in 2002. While cotton and aluminum, the two traditional pillars of the \neconomy, remain important driving forces, growth has become more broad-based. Economic \ndiversification is led in part by the rapid expansion of the service sector growing at 14.7% in \n2003. Inflation grew at 16.4% in 2003 compared with 14.2% in 2002 and an average rate of \n35% during 1999 and 2001. High inflation was mainly due to sharp increases in prices of \nimported grains and wheat flour, and tariff increases for electricity and gas introduced under the \nenergy sector reforms.  \n \n15.  External debt declined to 65% of GDP from 82% of the previous year. The Russian \nFederation and Uzbekistan are two major creditors from which Tajikistan imports oil and gas. \nThe external debt will be eased because of the recent agreement with the Russian Federation \nto write off $250 million in exchange for ownership of space facilities. \n \n16.  The economy of Tajikistan is highly dependent on foreign trade, with exports equivalent \nto  57%  of  GDP.  Cotton  and  aluminum  are  responsible  for  over  80%  of  export  earnings, \nrendering the economy extremely vulnerable to changes in the terms of trade, i.e., the prices of \nthese  commodities  in  the  international  market.  Imports  are  dominated  by  raw  materials, \nparticularly aluminum oxide for aluminum processing, gas for providing heating in major cities, \npetroleum products, and grain and flour. Major export destinations are Iran, Latvia, Netherlands, \nRussian Federation, Switzerland, Turkey, and Uzbekistan, while imports mainly come from \nAzerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Russian Federation, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan. Despite the favorable \nconditions for cotton and aluminum on the international market, the trade deficit widened in ", "  Appendix 2  29 \n2003 due to the increase in imports associated with strong growth. Exports reached $798 \nmillion, and imports $881 million. However, the current account deficit narrowed due to a sharp \nincrease in remittance from migrant workers reaching $202 million in 2003 compared with $65 \nmillion in 2002.  \n \n2.  Customs Administration  \n17.  Customs  administration,  CSD,  is  under  the  Ministry  of  State  Revenue  and  Duties \n(MSRD). It has about 1,500 employees located at the headquarters, regional offices, and border \nposts and inland clearance points.  \n \n18.  CSD plays a crucial role in trade facilitation, revenue collection, and curbing smuggling \nand drug trafficking. Despite its infancy, CSD\u2019s contribution to the national budget is significant \nwith over one third of all revenues. With its sizable contribution to the national budget, effective \nand efficient customs services are critical to the country\u2019s economic growth and development.  \n \n19.  Customs Legal Reforms. The Customs Code has been revised and is widely circulated \nto relevant authorities and organizations for comments and suggestions. It was submitted to the \nParliament on 30 September 2004. A key objective of the revision of the Customs Code is to \nreduce and simplify the existing customs regulations and procedures. The revised code has two \nimportant features: it is compliant with the Revised Kyoto Convention, which is the benchmark \nfor reforms and modernization of customs administrations worldwide; and it provides detailed \nregulations and procedural guidance to help significantly reduce the number of existing customs \nregulations.  \n \n20.  Revenue Collection. CSD collects import duties, excise taxes, and VAT on imported \ngoods. In 2003, total revenues collected were $103 million compared with $72 million in 2002, \nand $49 million in 2001. The introduction of the VAT resulted in the sharp increase in revenue \ncollection. In addition, CSD collects a fee of 0.15% on the value of goods cleared, and penalties \nimposed on inappropriate customs declaration and undervaluation. The fee collected amounted \nto $2.3 million in 2003, which represents a major source for staff salary, pension and insurance, \nand infrastructure development. Additionally, MSRD as a whole receives about $2 million from \nthe Government as part of the administrative budget.  \n \n21.  Customs  Infrastructure.  CSD  has  no  automated  declaration  system  or  adequate \ncommunications infrastructure to support modern customs practices, such as risk management \nand postentry audit. Among the five regional offices, only one has telecommunications tools for \ndata exchange through a radio communications data transfer system. Data exchange between \nborder posts and regional offices are carried out using floppy disks. The lack of technology \ncapacity to capture importers\u2019 entry data for customs declaration in a centralized place for \ncalculating duties and taxes and validating the entry is a major source of revenue loss and \ncorruption at border posts. The quality of customs statistics is poor and cannot be easily \ndistributed  to  the  relevant  government  agencies  for  trade  facilitation  and  antismuggling \npurposes.  \n \n22.  The border-post conditions are poor due to the civil war and inadequate budget provision \nfor maintenance. Very few border posts have permanent structures originally designed for \ncustoms operations. Very few customs posts have equipment for weighing and preventing \ncontraband and drug trafficking. In most border posts, electricity supply is unstable and at best \nprovided only for 7\u20138 hours a day, which gives opportunities for increased illicit trade. Without ", "30  Appendix 2 \ncustoms  automation  and  adequate  border-post  infrastructure,  the  benefit  of  customs  legal \nreforms and procedure simplification cannot be fully realized.  \n \n23.  Regional Customs Cooperation. Tajikistan is a member of the Eurasian Economic \nCommunity pursing the objective of forming a customs union of the member countries.

", "  Appendix 11  49 \nECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Economic Analysis \n1.  The economic analysis of the Project was conducted with a comparison of the with- and \nwithout-project  scenarios.  The  with-project  scenario  provides  significant  improvement  in \nefficiency of customs services resulting from automation, better border facilities, and simplified \ncustoms procedures. Corruption would be reduced because of less direct interfaces between \ncustoms  officers  and  traders  and  their  representatives.  As  a  result,  economic  benefits \nassociated with (i) incremental increase in trade from improving the overall trading environment \nand an increase in foreign direct investment, and (ii) time savings from reduced transaction \ncosts at border posts and inland clearance points. These two benefits are included in the \nmeasurement of the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) through a set of assumptions (para. \n3). The without-project scenario would be the current situation where customs declaration are \nprocessed manually and no major changes are made to border-post conditions because the \nrevenue generated from customs services fees is not even adequate for maintenance.  \n \n2.  The EIRR is calculated over 25 years. The benefits consist of incremental increase in \ntrade and time savings. The EIRRs are 21.50% for the Kyrgyz component and 23.34% for the \nTajikistan component. The regional benefits resulting from improved transit conditions in the two \ncountries are not quantified as they mainly accrue to neighboring countries. Another major \nnonquantified benefit is the promotion of the transport sector in the East and Central Asian \nRegion. \n \n3.  Specifically, the main assumptions for the EIRR are as follows: \n \n(i)  Economic  project  cost.  The  Kyrgyz  component  is  estimated  to  cost  $8.98 \nmillion, while the Tajikistan component is estimated to cost $12.73 million.1 \n \n(ii)  Incremental recurrent cost. Cost for maintenance, replacement, and upgrade \nof equipment and the system are about $898,000/annum for the Kyrgyz Republic \nand $1.08 million/annum for Tajikistan over 25 years. \n \n(iii)  Benefits from reduced transaction cost. Modernization of customs services \nsupported by the ongoing customs legal reforms, including the approval of the \nrevised customs codes, will contribute to speeding up of the customs clearance \nprocedures. As a result, the transaction costs and losses associated with long \nprocessing time will decline considerably. The annual savings on transport costs \nat border crossings and inland terminals under the Project will progressively \nreach about $1.9 million in the Kyrgyz Republic and $2.8 million in Tajikistan by \nthe end of 2029, compared with small progress expected without the Project.2 \n                                                \n1 Costs exclude price escalation, taxes and duties, interest, and commitment charges. \n2 Currently, the customs declaration has to be submitted to customs control where it is checked and registered in a \njournal. It then goes to the cashier\u2019s desk, and physical inspection of goods. Relevant parts of the declaration are \nsubmitted to the regional statistics office. The procedures generally take 1.5 hours to cross the border and complete \ncustoms clearance. The project activities are estimated to reduce the time costs of customs clearances by 10 \nminutes, and as such, yield benefits to both the government and traders. It is assumed that (i) 200 trucks cross the \nborder posts each day, (ii) there are 330 working days per year, and (iii) truck costs are $6 per hour. It is also \nassumed  that  185  customs  officers  are  engaged  in  processing  the  above-cited  transactions  and  that  their \nremuneration is at the rate of $0.12 per hour (based on data from the National Statistics Commission, Kyrgyz \nRepublic). \n ", "50  Appendix 11 \n \nThe estimated cost-benefits achievement path is as follows: 2005\u20145%, 2006\u2014\n20%, 2007\u201430%, 2008\u201440%, 2009 and thereafter\u201450%. \n \n(iv)  Benefits from expansion of trade. At present, the growth of foreign trade is \nrestrained partly due to lack of efficient and transparent customs services. The \nProject will address these major constraints and contribute to the development of \nan enabling trading environment in the two countries. Delivery of goods will \nbecome more reliable and efficient; this will stimulate the development of the \ntrade sector and of logistics services. In the medium-term, these factors are \nexpected to contribute to a sustained increase in trade. The economic benefits of \nexpanded  trade  will  stimulate  growth  of  cargo  transportation  and  other \ncommercial services related to foreign trade leading to creation of new jobs, \nbroadening of tax base, and growth of customs duties and fees. Due to the \ndifficulty to quantify the broad economic benefit of expanded trade, the benefit is \nassumed to be 20% of the benefit from reduced transaction costs. \n \n4.   Additional technical assumptions in calculating the financial and economic costs and \nbenefits of the Project based on the Guidelines on Economic and Financial Analysis of Projects \nof the Asian Development Bank (ADB) include  \n \n(i)  main indicators and coefficients are expressed in dollars;  \n(ii)  the period of analysis covers 25 years (2005\u20132029), carried out in constant 2004 \ndollar prices, with domestic prices used as the numeraire; \n(iii)  financial costs are converted into economic costs by excluding taxes and duties, \nand price contingencies;  \n(iv)  economic costs are calculated based on the annual project cost disbursements, \nwith incremental recurrent costs estimated at about 10% of capital costs; and  \n(v)  tradable goods of capital and operation and maintenance costs are adjusted \nbased on a shadow exchange rate factor of 1.10 (based on ADB guidelines). \nTradable goods are about 70% of project costs. \n \nTable A11.1: Economic Cost-Benefit \n($ million)  \n  Kyrgyz Republic   Tajikistan \nYear  Costs   Benefits  Costs   Benefits \n2005  1.18     0.22    1.55  0.28   \n2006  2.09     0.87    2.84  1.12   \n2007  2.55  1.31  3.49  1.68 \n2008  3.01  1.79  4.14  2.23 \n2009  1.68  2.18  2.24  2.79 \n2010\u20132029  20.92  47.36  25.42            69.84 \nTotal  31.42  53.73  39.67            77.94 \nEIRR       21.50%      23.34% \nNPV @ 12%    3.04    5.54 \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return.

Improvement in the overall \nefficiency  of  customs  services,  enhanced  customs  integrity,  more  selective  approaches  to \ncustoms controls based on risk management, and stronger enforcement capacity will enable the \ncustoms service departments (CSDs) to both expand the official volume of trade and deter \nunderreporting and undervaluation. Increased trade volume will boost revenue collection by the \nCSDs.  Automation  will  improve  transparency  and  reduce  corruption  by  minimizing  direct \ninterfaces between customs officers and traders and their representatives; enhanced customs \nintegrity  reduces  revenue  leakage  resulting  from  smuggling  and  undervaluation.  The \nintroduction of a risk management system under the Project will result in increased rate of \ndetection of smuggling and drug trafficking, which will also have a positive impact on revenue \ngeneration. The Project will enhance the CSDs\u2019 contribution to the Government budget.  \n \n ", "52  Appendix 12 \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \nA.

The Project aims to improve efficiency and transparency of customs services thereby contributing to the \nenhancement of the enabling environment for international trade and foreign direct investment. The poor will benefit \nfrom employment generated from enhanced trade and foreign direct investment. The Project is expected to reduce \ntransaction costs for trade in two ways: (i) efficiency gain through automation of customs services and improved \nborder clearance facilities, and (ii) reduced corruption by minimizing direct interfaces between customs officers and \ntraders and their representatives. Reduced transaction cost makes trade in small volume possible and therefore \ndirectly benefits the poor and small traders. Civil work for border-post development financed by the Project will directly \nbenefit the poor through employment.  \n \nImproved efficiency and governance will enhance revenue collection by the customs services departments. This \nrevenue represents a significant percentage of the government budget (currently estimated at around 35%). Adequate \nrevenue  collection  is  the  key  for  sound  fiscal  management  for  poverty  reduction  and  sustainable  economic \ndevelopment. The poor will benefit from improved provision of social services from the government budget.  \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                   Proposed Poverty Classification: Other \n \nThe ADB country strategies and programs for the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan show that the incidence of poverty \nfor both countries remains high in spite of recent progress in economic development and macroeconomic stabilization. \n \nFor the Kyrgyz Republic, latest available data shows that almost half of the population is poor. The level of poverty \npeaked at an estimated 55.3% on a per capita expenditure basis in 1999, following the Russian Federation\u2019s financial \ncrisis. Subsequent economic recovery significantly reduced aggregate poverty, with the headcount index of absolute \npoverty declining by about 11% in 2000\u20132002. Despite this progress, poverty remains high, with an estimated 44.4% \nof the population living in absolute poverty and 13.8 % living in extreme poverty in 2002.  \n \nRural poverty declined over 1998\u20132001 at an average rate of 8% per year largely due to better performance of the \nagriculture sector. However, rural poverty continues to be significantly higher than urban poverty. About three quarters \nof the poor people in 2001 were living in rural areas.  \n  \nThere is general consensus on the causes and determinants of poverty in the Kyrgyz Republic. The emergence of \nhigh levels of poverty can be traced to the disintegration of the Soviet Union, which caused severe reductions in \nproduction due to the disruption of geographically spread production and distribution chains and the loss of traditional \nmarkets. This in turn led to rapidly increasing unemployment at a time when the state\u2019s capacity to respond was \nimpaired by the loss of federal budgetary support and a sharp shrinkage of the revenue base. The continuing high \nlevels of poverty are largely due to challenges in the reform of state institutions and the restructuring of society and the \neconomy according to market rules and mechanisms, specifically: (i) difficulties creating and sustaining opportunities \nfor gainful employment on a substantial scale; (ii) problems relating to external and domestic market development for \nKyrgyz products, reflecting the landlocked nature of country with its trade and transit problems, limited natural \nresources, and small domestic market; (iii) limited capacity of the state to address essential needs in the social sectors \ndue to fiscal constraints; and (iv) continuing corruption and inefficiency in the instruments of state governance that \ninhibit private enterprise and legitimate entrepreneurial activity. \n \nPoverty reduction is the overarching objective of the Comprehensive Development Framework of the Kyrgyz Republic \nfor 2001\u20132010. The Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s Poverty Reduction Strategy, which is a medium-term operational plan (2003\u2013\n2005) to implement the goals of the Comprehensive Development Framework, envisages a three-pronged approach \nto development: (i) building an effective and transparent state, (ii) building a fair society, and (iii) promoting sustainable \neconomic growth. The importance of regional cooperation to this landlocked country particularly in trade, and transport \nlinks for enhancing exports is stressed in the Poverty Reduction Strategy. \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ", "  Appendix 12  53 \nFor Tajikistan, poverty likewise increased dramatically after 1991 with the collapse of the former Soviet Union. The \nWorld Bank's earlier estimates show that over 80% of the 1999 population lived below the poverty line. Poverty is \nmore pronounced in rural than in urban areas, with 81% of the poor living in rural areas. Families with many children \nand old people living alone have the highest risk of poverty. Female-headed families account for almost 30% of the \npoor.  \n \nAccording to the recent preliminary assessment by the World Bank, the incidence of poverty has come down to 68% \nfrom the previous level of 83% as estimated by the 1999 survey. However, much of the improvement comes from the \nurban sector. The poverty incidence remains high in rural areas, particularly in the southern part of the country. \n \nThe major causes of poverty in Tajikistan are: (i) a decline in output, wage levels, and employment resulting from the \ncollapse of the Soviet Union and the civil war; (ii) severance of central subsidies and fiscal adjustment, which reduced \nthe access of the poor to vital social services, health, education, and heating; and (iii) rising inequality. \n \nThe Tajikistan Government\u2019s Poverty Reduction Strategy, finalized in June 2002, has three main pillars to reduce \npoverty: (i) sustained high economic growth; (ii) improved governance; and (iii) improved access to social services, in \npart through better targeting. The strategy views growth of the agricultural sector and increased agricultural exports\u2014\nas well as adequate infrastructure for energy, transport, water supply, and communications\u2014as key to achieving \neconomic growth and poverty reduction. \n \nThe Project supports the two countries\u2019 poverty reduction strategies. The Project provides investment and assistance \nto (i) strengthen governance and transparency, and improve institutional capability in customs services to improve the \nenabling environment for market-oriented and private sector-led economic development; (ii) improve operational \nefficiency to facilitate trade and improve revenue collection, which generates employment and ensures adequate \nprovision of social services; and (iii) develop an effective mechanism for good regional cooperation in customs service \nthat would in the longer-term stimulate trade and economic growth, benefiting the poor and non-poor in the whole \nregion. \n \nC.
