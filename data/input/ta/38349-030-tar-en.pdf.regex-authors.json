THE ENSUING PROJECT \n \n1.  Nepal is a landlocked country of tremendous geographic diversity, with the northern rim \nof the Gangetic Plain in the south, the Himalaya Mountains in the north, and plenty of rugged, \nhilly terrain in between. Civil aviation is crucial to transport, trade, and tourism, and provides \nindispensable links to hilly and mountainous areas that are inaccessible by other transport modes. \nTourism is one of the major economic activities in Nepal and a top government priority. It is \nestimated that tourism brought in $563 million in foreign exchange in FY2018, equivalent to 65% \nof goods exports.1 Travel and tourism in Nepal is estimated to generate about $1.92 billion (7.8% \nof GDP) in 2018, including indirect and induced contribution.2 Considering that more than 80% of \ninternational tourists come to Nepal by air through the TIA, improvement of the civil aviation sector \nis essential for tourism to flourish and support the country\u2019s economic development.  \n \n2.  Nepal  has  a  large  airport  network,  comprising  one  international  airport,  the  TIA  in \nKathmandu, and 48 domestic airports.3 The TIA presently serves as the unique gateway airport \nto Nepal. It handled 4.3 million international passengers in 2018, up from 1.8 million passengers \nin 2008. It also serves as the largest domestic airport, handling 2.8 million domestic passengers \nin 2018\u2014accounting for about half of the country\u2019s domestic air traffic.4 The TIA handled 33,933 \ninternational and 95,580 domestic flights in 2018. With the tourism industry expected to continue \nto grow, it is expected that air traffic will steadily increase 3%\u20135% annually.5 Directing well-\ntargeted investments into the key international airports and creating an enabling environment for \nimprovement of the civil aviation sector will benefit the country\u2019s long-run economic development. \n \n3.  Nepal has maintained a traditional civil aviation sector structure whereby functions of \nregulation, safety oversight, and service provision are absorbed by one entity, CAAN. The roles \nof regulator and service provider lodged in a single organization create a source of conflict of \ninterest. To remedy this situation, the government is in the process of enacting new civil aviation \nlegislation, which were originally drafted with the assistance of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB).6 The main objective of the new bills is to reform the civil aviation sector in Nepal by \nbifurcating the roles of the regulator and the operator (CAAN) into separate entities. \n \n4.  The ensuing sector development program (SDP) will (i) support civil aviation sector \nreforms in restructuring of the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) and strengthening of its \nregulatory functions, management governance and business plan development in operations, \nfinancial restructuring, operational efficiency improvement, and civil aviation safety (the program \ncomponent); and (ii) finance the improvement of facilities at the Tribhuvan International Airport \n(TIA)  in  Kathmandu  and  the  Gautam  Buddha  International  Airport  (GBIA)  in  Lumbini  (the \n \n1  International Monetary Fund. 2018.

London. \n3  Of these 48 domestic airports, 27 have no scheduled flights. Four airports\u2014Biratnagar, Gautam Buddha, Nepalgunj, \nand Pokhara\u2014are regional hubs that receive passengers transiting to smaller domestic airports. GBIA will operate \nas a second international airport from 2020. \n4  Government of Nepal; Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation. 2018.

The SDP will \nhave the following impact: tourism in Nepal developed. It will have the following outcome: safety, \ncapacity, and efficiency of air travel to and from Nepal improved. The SDP is estimated to cost \n$276 million. The government has requested a concessional loan of $200 million from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources to help finance the SDP. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n5.  The transaction technical assistance (TA) will help the government (i) prepare a program \ndesign that complies with ADB requirements and international best practices; and (ii) implement \nthe SDP through (a) support for procurement activities for the investment component and (b) \nmonitoring and facilitating of execution of policy actions under the program component. The \npreparation of the SDP includes design of the reform program. \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n6.

Cost and Financing \n \n7.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.1 million, of which $1 million will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6).
