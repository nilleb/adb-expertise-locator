I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on two proposed \nloans to the Republic of Uzbekistan for the Amu Bukhara Irrigation System (ABIS) Rehabilitation \nProject.1 \n \n2.  The proposed project is located in Bukhara Province and two districts in Navoi Province \nin the central part of Uzbekistan. The ABIS command area of 315,000 hectares (ha) had a \npopulation  of  1.8  million  in  2012.  The  project  will  address  irrigated  agriculture  and  water \nresources management issues in the main command area of 250,000 ha in the ABIS.2  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT  \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Sector  overview.  Irrigated  agriculture  is  a  key  economic  sector  in  Uzbekistan, \naccounting for 90% of agricultural production which employs about 27% of country\u2019s total labor \nforce, and is the main source of livelihood in rural communities.3 More than 48% of the country\u2019s \npeople live in rural areas and depend on irrigated agriculture for their livelihood. To improve \nrural living standards, the government developed the updated Welfare Improvement Strategy for \n2012\u20132015  in  20134 and  launched  the  Integrated  Rural  Development  Program  in  2011.5 \nEnhancing the productivity and sustainability of irrigated agriculture\u2014which covers 4.3 million \nha\u2014is a central theme of both strategies. Improving irrigation and drainage (I&D) is critical to \nbetter agriculture productivity and competitiveness, and to sound environmental management. \n \n4.  The major challenges in the irrigated agriculture sector include insufficient investment. \nThe state\u2019s share in I&D expenditures was only about 1% against targeted 8% during 2007\u2013\n2010, and its share in agricultural investment declined from 4.1% to 3.1% during 2006\u20132010. \nOther challenges include (i) reduced agricultural productivity due to low water-use efficiency \n(about 40% on average); (ii) deteriorating system and on-farm infrastructure that has outlived its \neconomic life; (iii) reliance on pump irrigation\u2014which covers 65% of the irrigated area and \nconsumes 20% of the country\u2019s electricity; (iv) low energy efficiency at pump stations, which are \nof out-dated designs and are in a state of disrepair; (v) poor water management practices at \nalmost  every  level  of  the  irrigation  system;  and  (vi)  high  climate  sensitivity,  illustrated  by \nprojections that the country\u2019s water deficits will increase by 500% from 2 km3 in 2011 to 11\u201313 \nkm3  by  2050.6 Although  production  is  declining,  cotton  remains  a  major  agricultural  crop.  \nAdherence to international core labor standards is a concern; the government is cooperating \nwith the International Labour Organization (ILO) to address the situation. \n \n5.  The  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Water  Resources  (MAWR)  is  responsible  for  the \ndevelopment,  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M),  and  management  of  water  resources, \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance: ADB. 2011.

Following  MAWR\u2019s  reorganization  in  2003,  specialized interregional irrigation \nsystem authorities, including the Amu Bukhara Irrigation System Authority (ABISA), oversee the \nwater intake from main rivers, such as the Amu Darya, as well as irrigation water supply through \nmain  canals  and  main  pump  stations,  and  manage  the  O&M  of  these  assets.  O&M \nresponsibilities for the remaining portion of the overall system were divided between the basin \nirrigation system administrations (BISAs) at basin water management level, irrigation system \nadministrations (ISAs) at each I&D system level, and water consumers\u2019 associations (WCAs) at \nthe farm level. This reorganization has remained in the transition stage, however, and improving \nthe coordination between the BISAs, ISAs, and WCAs and upgrading their technical skills would \nimprove water management efficiency.  \n  \n6.  ADB has helped the government improve agriculture performance through five projects \nsince 2001, including two projects in irrigation. The rehabilitation of Amu Zang Irrigation System \nwill increase the reliability, efficiency, and sustainability of irrigation water supply.7 The Water \nResources Management Sector  Project will sustain and increase agriculture productivity in \nirrigation system areas in selected river basins.8 ADB\u2019s positioning in the agriculture and natural \nresources sector was rated satisfactory, and its sector strategy has been considered highly \nrelevant to the government\u2019s priorities and the sector\u2019s needs, which include financing for large \nphysical  investments  such  as  I&D  rehabilitation,  an  area  in  which  the  government  and \ndevelopment partners recognize ADB\u2019s expertise.9  \n \n7.  Amu Bukhara Irrigation System Authority overview. Population growth of 1.7% a \nyear in the ABIS command area will have a potentially significant impact on the availability of \nwater.10 About 6,500 farmers depended on agricultural activities in the command area in 2011, \nwith support from 145 WCAs. The ABIS intake channel from the Amu Darya River and about 22 \nkilometers (km) of the 385-km main canal from the intake channel are located in neighboring \nTurkmenistan. O&M of these sections is carried out by the MAWR under a bilateral agreement \nbetween the two countries.11 The ABIS also provides domestic water supply for an estimated \n725,000  people  in  its  command  areas.12 Cotton  cultivation  has  gradually  declined  in  the \ncommand area since 1990 due to an increase of winter wheat and more diversified cropping.13  \n \n8.  The ABIS was commissioned in 1965, and its main pump stations covering 250,000 ha \nhave exceeded their design life spans. The system\u2019s canals are in poor condition. The supply of \nirrigation water has become more unreliable due to several major failures of ABIS pumping \nequipment. Continued breakdowns leading to future declines in pumping capacity seem likely. \nExpenditures on O&M have been high (SUM154 billion, including electricity costs of SUM122 \nbillion, in 2011).14 Another factor in the declining water supplies has been the ABIS\u2019s inadequate \nregulatory structures and its inefficient water supply operations and management. This has \nresulted in low conveyance efficiency (15%\u201320% of water does not reach farms from main canal \nintakes, and 15% of water does not reach main canal intakes from the intake of Amu Darya \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2004.

Bukhara. http://www.buxoro.uz/ \n11 The agreement on cooperation on water economics between Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan  was signed in \n  January 1996. \n12 This 2011 figure was obtained from the statistic departments of the Bukhara Province and the Kizil Tepa and \nKarmana districts. \n13 The areas planted to cotton have been reduced by 55%\u201360% since 1990. \n14 ABISA O&M cost report for 2007\u20132011. ", "    3 \n \nRiver), which in turn pose a serious threat to agricultural production and to the livelihood of local \ncommunities.  The  aging,  energy-inefficient  pump  stations  are  also  consuming  overly  large \namounts  of  electricity\u2014equivalent  to  about  60%  of  total  energy  consumption  in  Bukhara \nProvince\u2014and their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in 2011 are estimated to be equivalent to \n758,000\u2013935,000  tons  of  carbon  dioxide.  Land  quality  in  the  ABIS  command  area  is \ndeteriorating,  with  about  12%  of  land  in  the  Bukhara  Province  considered  unsuitable  for \nagriculture. This is mainly due to salinity, attributed to overuse of irrigation water under arid \nclimatic and poor drainage conditions, which leads to salt accumulation in the soil. \n \n9.  Climate change impacts. Climate change is expected to affect the ABIS in several \nways. The average demand for crop water is likely to increase by about 9% by 2050. Climate \nchange alone will result in a decrease in average Amu Darya River flow from the current 38 km\u00b3 \nper year to an estimated 22\u201328 km\u00b3/year, and the year-to-year variability of its flow is expected \nto increase from its historic range of 31%\u201334% to 36%\u201344% in 2050. More frequent water \ndeficits will have the potential in some years to pose serious irrigation problems by 2050.15  \n \n10.  The  government\u2019s  Welfare  Improvement  Strategy  estimated  the  investment \nrequirements for the agriculture and irrigation sector during 2012\u20132015 to be $2.1 billion and \ncalled for foreign investments of $1.9 billion. The project will help fill the resulting financial gap \nand support the government\u2019s 2011 Integrated Rural Development Program, which prioritized \nimprovement in water management, higher productivity from water use, and the rehabilitation of \nirrigation systems. The project is consistent with the priorities of the ADB's country partnership \nstrategy for 2012\u20132016, which recommends that ADB provide new assistance for rehabilitation \nof major irrigation systems to be more energy-efficient and climate-resilient.16 The strategy also \nrecommends  ADB\u2019s  support  to  the  improvements  in  climate-adaptive  on-farm  water \nmanagement and the productivity of water resources.     \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The  expected  impact  of  the  project  is  sustained  economic  and  social  welfare \nimprovement in communities dependent upon the ABIS. The expected outcome is a sustainable \nand reliable water supply in the ABIS command area. \n \nC.  Outputs \n12.  Output 1: One new pump station built and four existing ones modernized and \nrehabilitated. This output includes (i) the replacement of Khamza 1 pump station and its \nauxiliary  pump  station  with  a  new  Khamza  1  pump  station,  and  (ii)  modernization  and \nrehabilitation (M&R) of the Kuyu Mazar, Khamza 2, and Kizil Tepa and its auxiliary pump \nstations. The benefits will be (i) reduced energy consumption, (ii) sustained and reliable water \nsupply without operational and system failures, and (iii) a reduction of GHG emissions by 23%. \n   \n13.  Output 2: Conveyance efficiency in the ABIS main canal increased. This will be \nachieved by (i) the M&R of 22 key regulatory and/or diversion structures, and (ii) installation of \nwater measurement gauges and wireless radio communication systems along the ABIS main \ncanal  in  Uzbekistan.  The  M&R  of  these  structures  and  the  modernized  irrigation  system \nmanagement will reduce inefficient water discharge from the main canal.  \n                                                \n15 Centre of Hydrometeorological Service of the Republic of Uzbekistan. 2008.

This output will be delivered through (i) M&R of inter- and on-farm canals \nand regulation structures in three selected areas; (ii) introduction of climate-adaptive agronomic \npractices, cropping patterns, and water-saving irrigation technologies in demonstration farms in \nthree selected areas; (iii) the development of a modernized, climate-adaptive water operation \nand  management  plan  to  increase  water  productivity  based  on  a  detailed  water  balance \nassessment,  and  (iv)  capacity  development  of  the  BISA,  three  ISAs,  and  three  WCAs  in \nBukhara Province.17 These measures will also support the government strategy to diversify \ncrops and ensure food security in the project area. \n \n15.  Output 4: Project and ABIS managed efficiently. The activities for achieving this \noutput will comprise project management, institutional, and operational support. The project \nmanagement support will include (i) implementation of safeguards requirements, and (ii) project \nsupervision,  procurement,  and  financial  management.  The  project  will  also  strengthen \ninstitutional and human capacity, ABIS operations, and management in ABISA. A modernized \nplan  will  be  adopted  so  that  energy  and  water  are  used  efficiently  in  the  operation  and \nmanagement of pump stations and main canals. Capacity building will also be provided for the \nABISA to integrate GHG monitoring-reporting-verification systems. To augment O&M financing, \nthe  commercialization  of  carbon  credits  will  be  pursued  through  the  Clean  Development \nMechanism or other mechanisms.   \n \n16.  In addition, drainage channels at inter-farm and on-farm levels that are in poor condition \nwill be rehabilitated by the government\u2019s Amelioration Fund18 and the ongoing ADB-financed \nLand Improvement Project to reduce soil salinity in the ABIS command area.19 \n \nD.

DUE DILIGENCE  \nA.  Technical  \n23.  The project\u2019s technical viability and sustainability has been assessed as part of the due \ndiligence exercise. The need to construct a new Khamza 1 pump station was justified by the \nconsultant\u2019s survey and assessment in 2012 that concluded insufficient seismic capacity of the \nexisting Khamza 1 pump station. Selection of the sections that will undergo M&R at the other \npump stations under the project followed international best practices, as did the assessments of \nthe potential GHG emission reductions and the energy efficiency of each pump station. The \nneed for further O&M by the government of the sections of the ABIS that lie in Turkmenistan \n                                                \n20 ADB and JICA will enter into an agreement to address issues arising from cofinancing of this project, including \nenvironmental and social safeguard aspects.  \n21 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "    7 \n \nwas confirmed by a special field survey. Climate change risk was assessed through the use of \nthe latest modeling results and projections to propose adaptation options. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n24.  Economic  analysis. Recurrent costs and benefits schedules were prepared for the \nwithout- and with-project situations. Four separate elements to analyze economic viability were \nidentified: (i) energy costs; (ii) costs for the maintenance of pump stations; (iii) other O&M costs \nfor ABIS; and (iv) periodic maintenance costs (under the with-project scenario only). \n \n25.  In  the  without-project  situation,  the  following  was  assessed  as  a  base  case:  the \noperating capability of the pumps would gradually decline without the project, but the pumps \nwould  keep  running.  In  this  case,  it  was  assumed  that  current  maintenance  costs  would \nincrease over time. A matching decline in cropped area resulting from a decrease in water \nsupply from the diminishing pump capacity was also estimated and, by applying crop budgets in \neconomic prices, a schedule of overall net income for the project area was calculated. In the \nwith-project situation, the analysis assumed that the overall net income in the project area would \nremain the same as at present. The maintenance costs under the with-project scenario would \nbe higher than those without the project due to the increased servicing needs of the modern \nequipment to be provided by the project, which is considerably more sophisticated than what is \ncurrently  in  use.  In  the  with-project  scenario,  however,  power  consumption  is  significantly \nreduced by the improved pumping efficiency provided by the new equipment. The resulting \ngains in reduced power costs more than offset the higher maintenance costs. \n \n26.  The analysis found the economic internal rate of return to be 14%, indicating that the \nproject is economically viable. Results of the sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of the \nproject\u2019s economic viability. \n \n27.  Financial analysis. The results of a farm budget analysis indicated that regardless of \nfarm size, the without-project scenario would decrease the total ABIS service areas by up to \n20%.22  Under the with-project scenario, the entire area would continue to receive ABIS service. \nThe financial sustainability of ABIS O&M will be improved under the with-project scenario by the \nproject\u2019s  (i) introduction of an ABIS operation and management plan to use water and energy \nmore  efficiently,  as  well  as  its  capacity  building  for  ABIS  staff,  (ii)  reduction  of  power \nconsumption by the replacement of old pumps and motors with energy-efficient ones, (iii) aim to \ntrade  carbon  credits  to  complement  O&M  expenditure,  and  (iv)  ensuring  that  the  MAWR \nprovides  the  ABIS  with  fully  required  O&M  funds,  including  an  increase  to  cover  O&M \nexpenditures for ABIS sections in Turkmenistan. Administration budgets for both ABISA and the \nBISA have been fully financed by the MAWR.   \n \nC.  Governance \n28.  Financial and procurement management. The assessment found that the MAWR\u2019s \nfinancial,  accounting,  and  procurement  systems,  including  management,  reporting,  and \nmonitoring capacity, are not adequate enough to manage the project directly. The accounts of \nprojects fully funded by the MAWR have not been audited by independent external auditors, but \nthrough procedural audits required by the Ministry of Finance. A regular and thorough external \nannual audit will be carried out on the project accounts each year. The project will require a \nproject management office (PMO) staffed with experienced personnel. This is because the \n                                                \n22 An analysis was conducted in 2012 for farms of 50 ha, 100 ha, and 200 ha in size. \n ", "8   \nMAWR staff still lack sufficient financial and procurement management capacity and experience \nto  manage  large-scale  investment  projects  directly  or  to  prepare  bidding  documents  and \nevaluate bids for relatively large contracts that require a complex bidding process. In addition, \nthe PMO will ensure the compliance of accounting policy and procedures with both national and \nADB regulations.  \n \n29.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and the MAWR. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual.23 \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n30.  Household and poverty reduction impacts. The primary beneficiaries of the project \nwill be the rural communities and the farmers in the ABIS area. The reliable and sustainable \nwater supply under the project, including drinking water for 725,000 people, will help to sustain \nhousehold incomes and food security and reduce poverty. The core cause of low domestic \nagricultural production is inadequate access to irrigation water. About 93% of respondents in \nsurvey area reported using water from rivers, canals, and ditches to irrigate their land, and \nabout 87% said that a lack of irrigation water dramatically affects crop production on their \nplots.24 Every fourth household surveyed did not use its land for crop production at all due to an \ninsufficient and/or unreliable supply of water for irrigation, and 14.5% of respondents said this \nwas due to too little water in the ABIS canals. Although 16% of the national population was \nliving below poverty line in 2011, the figure across project area respondent households was \n49%. Poor families were more severely affected by irrigation water shortages than non-poor \nones. About 29% of the water in the project area is required for cotton farming.25 There are \nconcerns about core labor standards, particularly during the harvest. ADB is committed to \nsupporting adherence to the core labor standards. Suitable loan covenants have been included \nto ensure such adherence in relation to project activities, and will be monitored during project \nimplementation. ADB will also closely interact with the government, including through policy \ndialogue, the ILO, and other institutions on this matter.   \n \n31.  Gender  impacts.  Women  do  most  of  the  unpaid  domestic  work  in  project  area \nhouseholds  and  have  little  authority  in  household  decision  making.  Women  are  also \nunderrepresented in water management institutions, making up only 9.3% of the employees of \nABISA and 10% of the staff of the BISA of Bukhara Province. They are completely absent from \nmanagement. 53%\u201368% of employment in agriculture on a full time basis in surveyed areas \nwas women. This is mainly due to the migration of men to neighboring countries to find well-paid \njobs. Because women lack representation in the WCAs, those that have a dispute over access \nto irrigation water must somehow gain the involvement of the National Women's Machinery, a \npublic organization, to pursue their cases.26 Yet project surveys found that 74% of people felt \nthat women play an important role in managing water rationally.  \n32.  To encourage the involvement and representation of women in water management, the \nproject will include interventions to guarantee participation by women in the water resources \n                                                \n23 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 Based  on project preparatory  technical  assistance  socioeconomic survey  (November  2012  in  Bukhara and \nRomitan districts). \n25 Other usage of the water includes vegetable; wheat; fodder; fruit; maize; pre-irrigation/leaching; as well as drinking \nwater.  \n26 The National Women\u2019s Machinery is the women\u2019s committee of Uzbekistan, which is registered as a public \norganization but chaired by the deputy prime minister in charge of women\u2019s issues. The women\u2019s committee has \nbranches and representatives in all regions.   ", "    9 \n \nfield. The project will hire at least one female staff member in the project implementation office. \nIt will engage a gender specialist consultant to conduct an information campaign that clearly \nidentifies the important role women play and should play in farming and water management in \nthe ABIS area. The specialist will train women in WCAs to become members of the WCA \nsecretariats and to improve water management services and decision making.  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n33.  Environment (category B). The initial environmental examination (IEE) was undertaken \nand  an  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  was  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  The  public,  including  civil  society  organizations  were \nadequately consulted. The IEE indicated that most environmental impacts will occur during \nconstruction. The MAWR has agreed to implement the EMP and submit regular reports on its \nimplementation. The IEE report, including the EMP, has been published on the ADB website. \nDuring  project  implementation,  ADB  and  JICA  will  each  be  responsible  for  safeguard \ncompliance in their respective project activities.  \n \n34.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The project will not involve or affect any ethnic \nminority or indigenous people, as defined by ADB\u2019s safeguard policy. The poverty and social \nassessment study showed that no ethnic minority or indigenous peoples were present in the \nproject area.   \n \n35.  Involuntary resettlement (category C). The project will not require land acquisition. \nThe new Khamza pump station will be constructed within areas owned by the ABISA. These \nareas have been fenced since the establishment of the ABIS in the early 1960s. Since the \nproject is within the existing facilities, the social compliance audit report which confirmed that no \nland will be acquired for the project with no past and present claims on the land for this existing \nfacilities was prepared and has been disclosed on the ADB website. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n36.    Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.27 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nImproper accounting  A separate accounting policy for the project will be developed following the requirements of \nand auditing may allow  ADB and the MOF. The MAWR has not been audited by an external auditor. The project \nthe misconduct of  accounts will be audited by independent external auditors in accordance with the \nproject\u2019s fund.  International Standards on Auditing, which comply with the requirements of ADB.  \nMAWR\u2019s weak  The MAWR does not have a department responsible for procurement. Staff members who \ncapacity may cause  have gained some procurement capacity through their involvement in donor-financed \nmisprocurement and  projects still lack the ability to evaluate tenders through international competitive bidding.  \nconsequently delay  Project implementation consultant will help the PMO prepare tender documents that meet \nproject implementation.  ADB\u2019s requirement, and provide the project staff with trainings in tender evaluation.  \nInsufficient budget  The project will (i) improve O&M practices by establishing a water- and energy- efficient \nallocation for system  ABIS operation and management plan and capacity building programs, (ii) reduce power \nO&M and low capacity  consumption by replacing old pumps and motors with energy-efficient ones, (iii) trade \nin the ABISA may  carbon credits to complement O&M expenditure, and (iv) ensure that the MAWR provides \nthreaten ABIS  the ABIS with fully required O&M funds, including an increase to cover O&M expenditures \nsustainability.  for ABIS sections in Turkmenistan.   \nSlow government  The risk of implementation delays arises from the MAWR\u2019s slow internal approval \n                                                \n27 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10   \napprovals could delay  processes, a lack of cooperation between government agencies, and delayed recruitment of \ntendering,  necessary staff. A delay in approval of project implementation consultant by the Ministry of \nprocurement,  Foreign Economic Relation Investment and Trade has also been identified as a possible risk \nengagement of  to timely implementation. Advance contracting to recruit project implementation consultant \nconsultants, and  and to procure the turnkey contracts will reduce these risks. The government has assured \nproject implementation.  ADB of adequate and timely release of counterpart funds. The authority for endorsing \nprocurement decisions including contract variations in the MAWR will be delegated to the \nproject manager. Advanced actions are being taken to establish the PMO and recruit staff. \nABIS = Amu Bukhara Irrigation System, ADB = Asian Development Bank, MAWR = Ministry of Agriculture and Water \nResources, O&M = operation and maintenance, PMO = project management office. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n37.  The  government,  the  MAWR,  and  the  Ministry  of  Finance  have  assured  ADB  that \nimplementation  of  the  project  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those \nconcerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and \ndisbursement, as described in detail in the project administration manual and loan documents. \n \n38.  The government, the MAWR, and Ministry of Finance have agreed with ADB on certain \ncovenants for the project, which are set forth in the loan agreements.  \n \n39.  The  government  and  the  MAWR  have  agreed  with  ADB  that  disbursement  of  the \nproceeds of the loans, except for consulting services and project management and monitoring, \nwill be conditional upon (i) establishment by the MAWR of a fully operational organization \nstructure for project implementation to ADB\u2019s satisfaction, including a project management office \nin the MAWR in Tashkent and a project implementation office in ABISA in Bukhara Province, (ii) \nthe appointment of a project manager by the government acceptable to ADB, and (iii) the \neffectiveness of the loan agreement between the government and JICA.  \n \nV.
