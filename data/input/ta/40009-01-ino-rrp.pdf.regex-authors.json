In  November  2006,  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  approved  a  loan  of  $400  million  for \nsubprogram 1, a loan of $26.5 million equivalent for the PDF, a grant of \n$2.0 million for the TA, and administration by ADB of a $7.6 million \ngrant provided by the Government of the Netherlands for the PDF. The \ncurrent proposal comprises a loan of $280 million for subprogram 2 of \nthe IRSDP. \n   \nClassification  Targeting classification: General intervention \nSector: Multisector \nThemes:  Sustainable  economic  growth,  private  sector  development, \ngovernance \nSubthemes:  Fostering  physical  infrastructure  development,  public\u2013\nprivate  partnerships,  promoting  economic  efficiency  and  enabling \nmarkets \n   \nEnvironment  Category C  \nAssessment \n   \nProgram Rationale  Combined public and private sector investments in the infrastructure \nsectors in Indonesia exceeded 5% of gross domestic product (GDP) in \nthe mid-1990s. The Asian financial crisis of 1997 led to a steep decline \nin  overall  development  spending,  and  particularly  infrastructure \ninvestments.  Private  sector  investment  almost  disappeared.  At  the \nsame time, the Government realized that the public sector had borne a \ndisproportionate  share  of  the  risks  in  infrastructure  projects,  and \nstopped providing any risk-sharing support. As a result, Indonesia has \nlost its place as one of the top performers in terms of infrastructure \nprovision  in  the  Southeast  Asian  region.  Poor  people  suffer \ndisproportionately from lack of access to basic infrastructure services. \nAvailability  of  services  is  generally  lower  in  rural  areas,  particularly \noutside Java and Bali, contributing to significant regional disparities in \ndevelopment. \n \nAt  the  outset  of  its  term,  the  Government  estimated  that  about \n$65 billion would be needed in new infrastructure investments during \n2005\u20132009, with $25 billion (38%) to be sourced from its budget, $14 \nbillion (22%) from domestic banks and insurance and pension funds, \n$10 billion (15%) from multilateral and bilateral development partners, \nand  $16  billion  (25%)  from  domestic  and  foreign  private  sector \ninvestors.  Given  the  weak  investment  climate,  the  Government \nrecognized that PSP could not be taken for granted, and that major \nstructural  and  institutional  reforms  were  needed.  The  IRSDP, \n ", "ii    \nformulated  jointly  by  the  Government  and  its  principal  development \npartners, supports a comprehensive medium-term reform agenda in \neight infrastructure sectors.        \n \nThe program loan support three key reform pillars: \n \n(i)  strategic cross-sector reforms; \n(ii)  sector-specific reforms for transportation, power, oil and gas, \nwater supply and sanitation, and telecommunications; and \n(iii)  facilitation of the preparation and execution of well-structured \nPPP  transactions,  resulting  in  sound  model  infrastructure \nprojects that can be replicated. \n   \nImpact and  The IRSDP, of which subprogram 2 is an integral part, aims to improve \nOutcome  Indonesia\u2019s  overall  investment  climate  by  removing  infrastructure \nbottlenecks  and  increasing  access  to  infrastructure  services,  and \nthereby support timely realization of the Government\u2019s medium-term \nmacroeconomic goals, in particular average GDP growth of 6%\u20137% per \nannum  during  2005\u20132009.  The  expected  outcome  of  the  IRSDP  is \naccelerated  infrastructure  development  through  major  PSP  and \nmobilization of additional public sector resources. \n \nThe  initial  impact  of  the  IRSDP  has  been  positive.  GDP  growth \naccelerated  from  5.0%  in  2004  to  6.3%  in  2007,  and  annual \ninfrastructure investments rose from 2.9% of GDP in 2005 to 3.3% in \n2006. \n   \nProgram Investment  For  subprogram  1,  in  November  2006  ADB  provided  a  loan  of \nPlan  $400  million.  This  was  followed  in  March  2007  by  cofinancing  of \n  $100  million  from  the  Government  of  Japan.  Similar  cofinancing  is \nplanned by the Government of Japan for the $280 million ADB loan \nproposed  for  subprogram  2  in  2008.  The  World  Bank  has  been \nsupporting the reform agenda through its Infrastructure Development \nPolicy Loan program. The first loan of $200 million was approved in \nDecember 2007, and the same amount is considered for the second \nloan  in  2008.  The  loans  of  the  three  development  partners  for \nsubprogram 3 are expected to be in the same order of magnitude and \nwill  be  reconfirmed  during  further  implementation  of  the  IRSDP  in \n2009\u20132010.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  The $280 million for subprogram 2 will be provided from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a \ngrace period of 3 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per \nannum,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft \nprogram loan agreement.  \n   \n ", "iii \nPeriod and  Subprogram 1 was completed between January 2005 and September \nTranching  2006. Subprogram 2 timing is from October 2006 up to September \n2008,  and  the  period  for  subprogram  3  is  from  October  2008  to \nSeptember  2010.  All  three  program  loans  are  disbursed  in  single \ntranches upon declaration of their effectiveness. \n   \nExecuting Agency  The National Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS), under the \noverall coordination of the National Committee on the Acceleration of \nInfrastructure Provision (KKPPI) has been the Executing Agency for the \nIRSDP.  BAPPENAS  has  closely  collaborated  with  the  Coordinating \nMinistry of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, and the line ministries \nconcerned  with  executing  the  IRSDP  and  implementing  the  reform \nactions.  \n   \nProcurement  The loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange \ncosts (excluding local duties and taxes) of items produced and procured \nin  ADB  member  countries,  excluding  ineligible  items  and  imports \nfinanced by other bilateral and multilateral sources. The loan proceeds \nwill be disbursed to the Borrower in accordance with the provisions of \nADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related \nRequirements for Program Loans.  \n   \nProgram Benefits  The IRSDP\u2019s expected benefits include \nand Beneficiaries  (i)  sustained progress in meeting the Government\u2019s macroeconomic \nobjectives articulated in its Medium-Term Development Plan for \n2004\u20132009; \n(ii)  an improved investment climate resulting from sound policy, legal, \nand institutional frameworks in the infrastructure sectors; \n(iii)  greater PSP and a more systematic approach to implementing \nPPP transactions, focusing on good governance; \n(iv)  a transparent and prudent risk-sharing system; \n(v)  quality infrastructure projects prepared and executed transparently \nand expeditiously, resulting in (a) improved availability and quality \nof  infrastructure  services,  (b)  a  boost  to  Indonesia\u2019s \ncompetitiveness in regard to its regional neighbors, and (c) a lower \nincidence of poverty; \n(vi)  sustained engagement by ADB in policy reforms over the medium \nterm to strengthen the investment climate; and \n(vii)  aid harmonization by the principal development partners (ADB, the \nWorld Bank, and the Government of Japan) around a common \npolicy framework, and the positive externalities resulting from joint \nendorsement of the Government\u2019s reform agenda. \n   \nRisks and  Government Commitment. The political commitment could possibly \nAssumptions  waver  because  of  internal  disagreements  over  policy  directions,  or \nbecause the entire Government may change after the elections in 2009. \nThe majority of opinions within the current Government confirm the \nnotion that the Government remains strongly committed to the reform \nprogram embodied in the IRSDP and the complementing Infrastructure \nDevelopment Policy Loan program. The 2009 elections pose only a \nmoderate  risk  of  weakened  commitment  and  a  loss  of  the  reform \nmomentum, as even with a change of Government, the new leaders are \nexpected  to  continue  focusing  on  economic  growth  and  poverty \n ", "iv    \nreduction to ensure a sound tenure in office and mitigate social and \npolitical  unrest.  However,  should  the  new  Government  not  be \ncommitted to maintaining reform momentum, subprogram 3 could be \ndelayed or cancelled.  \n \nGovernment  Coordination.  At  times,  the  progress  of  infrastructure \nreforms has been impeded by poor coordination among government \nministries  and  agencies,  and  competing  and  conflicting  interests  of \nvarious stakeholders. While full and effective coordination and reforms \nin certain sectors may take time to evolve and needs further consensus \nbuilding, the essential steps taken thus far will have a demonstrational \neffect in supporting infrastructure development in a coordinated manner \nin the coming years. \n  \nGovernment Capacity. While the Government remains committed to \nreform objectives, the ability to translate that commitment into practical \nreform achievements is subject to available capacity within the different \nGovernment ministries and agencies. In several areas, progress has \nbeen slower than was anticipated by the Government when the IRSDP \nwas agreed upon. This has typically been the result of low capacity, \ncompounded  by  weak  coordination.  Mitigation  strategies  include \nrealistic outputs and schedules based on likely reform progress, and \ncontinued provision of TA for capacity building. \n \nPoor Governance and Corruption. With the high stakes involved in \nlarge infrastructure projects, the IRSDP faces significant risks in the \nform of weak governance, collusion, and corruption, or lack of judicial \ncapacity to enforce good-governance measures. Such problems have \nbeen common in the past in Indonesia. However, during the last few \nyears the Government has considerably strengthened its anticorruption \nefforts.  Procurement  reforms  have  been  under  way  for  some  time, \nresulting in a competitive and transparent selection of bidders by the \npublic sector. The PSP legal framework, adopted as part of the IRSDP, \nsets out clear rules for the selection of private sector sponsors for PPP \nprojects. KKPPI is tasked with ensuring that tendering processes are \nfair  and  transparent.  The  president  of  Indonesia  has  considerably \nenhanced the profile and activities of the Anti-Corruption Commission \nand other law enforcement agencies. These steps are already having a \nsignificant impact.    \n \nMacroeconomic Stability. Domestic macroeconomic volatility, adverse \nglobal events such as high oil and food prices, natural disasters, or the \nlack of sustained momentum on policy reforms could impede PSP. \nHowever, over the last few years, the Indonesian economy has been \nquite resilient to domestic and external shocks, and the Government\u2019s \nmacroeconomic policies have been sound. The country\u2019s balance of \npayments  remains  in  strong  surplus,  foreign  reserve  levels  have \nreached $58 billion, and public debt as a share of GDP was 35% in \n2007 and was expected to decline to 30% in 2008. The banking sector \nappears sound, with moderate levels of nonperforming loans and high \ncapital\u2013adequacy ratios. As a result of good macroeconomic stability, \nIndonesia\u2019s debt rating was upgraded to BB by Fitch in February 2008. \n ", "v \nFurther deterioration in global economic conditions can make Indonesia \nvulnerable to sudden shifts in investor sentiment. \n \nSocial Tensions. Tariff reforms are sensitive in any environment, and \nIndonesia is no exception. As the country is gradually moving away \nfrom  administered  prices  and  tariffs  for  infrastructure  products  and \nservices, social tensions are inevitable. The Government has so far \nbeen  successful  in  reducing  such  tensions  by  the  two-pronged \napproach of (i) comprehensively socializing any planned price and tariff \nincreases, and (ii) using the savings from the reduction in inefficient \nsubsidies for direct poverty reduction, employment generation, and rural \ninfrastructure development. \n \n ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  the  Infrastructure  Reform  Sector  Development  Program \n(IRSDP) \u2013 Subprogram 2. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n2.  Indonesia has seen increasingly strong economic expansion since recovering from the \nAsian financial crisis in 1997. In 2007, economic growth accelerated to a 10-year high of 6.3%, \ndespite a slowing global economy. Domestic demand coupled with private investment has been \na key driver of the recent economic growth. Poverty levels fell from over 16.5% in 2007 to \n15.5% in March 2008. These developments are even more surprising against the backdrop that \nIndonesia has also successfully recovered from a number of natural disasters, including the \ntsunami of December 2004 in Aceh. Despite the associated disaster relief expenditures, fiscal \nspace  has  been  created  to  enable  a  resumption  of  the  pre-crisis  levels  of  infrastructure \ninvestments.  Indonesia\u2019s  key  macroeconomic  indicators  for  2005\u20132008  are  summarized  in \nTable 1. \n \nTable 1: Indonesia\u2019s Key Macroeconomic Indicators \n \nItem  2005  2006  2007  2008a \nGDP growth (%)   5.7    5.5  6.3  6.2 \nInflation rate (%, average for the year)     10.5  13.1  6.4  10.6 \nMoney supply (M2) (% annual growth)     16.4  14.9      18.9  16.4 \nCentral government debt (% of GDP)     45.5  35.3      31.5  27.6 \nOverall fiscal balance/GDP    (0.5)    (0.9)  (1.2)  (1.3) \nCurrent account balance (% of GDP)  0.1    2.9  2.4  1.9 \nMerchandise export (annual % change)  22.9  19.0  14.0  13.8 \nMerchandise import (annual % change)  37.2  6.3  15.0  19.0 \nGross official reserves ($ billion)     34.7  42.6  56.9  57.1 \n       a = Projected, ( ) = negative, GDP = gross domestic product, M2 = broad money. \nSources: Ministry of Finance, Central Bureau of Statistics, International Monetary Fund, and Asian Development \nBank estimates. \n \n3.  As is the case with its Asian neighbors, Indonesia has been confronting significant \ninflationary pressures in 2008; inflation rose sharply from the beginning of the year to 12.1% \nyear-on-year in September 2008. Despite the current global economic slowdown, Indonesia\u2019s \nmacroeconomic fundamentals held up reasonably well through the first 8 months of 2008. \nIndonesia\u2019s balance of payments remained in strong surplus in 2007, with the current account \nrecording a surplus of 2.5% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2007. Exports jumped by 31% \nduring the first 6 months of 2008 due to higher commodity prices and volume growth. However, \nreflecting strong domestic consumer and investment growth, imports more than doubled during \nthis period, resulting in a small deficit in the current account in the second quarter of 2008. \nForeign direct investment continued to remain strong in 2008, and reserves peaked at $60.5 \nbillion at the end of July 2008 before moderating to $52 billion at the middle of October 2008 as \nthe  Government  attempted  to  stabilize  the  rupiah,  which  depreciated  from  an  average  of \nRp9,150 to the dollar at the beginning of September to Rp10,600 to the dollar at the end of \nOctober, amid the volatility in the financial markets. Public debt continues to fall as a share of \nGDP; it was below 35% in 2007 and is likely to approach 30% in 2008. Total external debt is \nalso falling, and is likely to be a little below 30% of GDP in 2008.   \n \n4.  International oil prices generated significant pressure on the central government budget, \nbut the overall fiscal position has remained sound. Recent trends in revenue from sources other \nthan oil and gas have been especially favorable. However, energy subsidies are likely to make \n ", "2    \nup 4.7% of GDP and consume 20% of the 2008 budget. Driven by the increase in subsidies, \nmeasures have been proposed to cut nonpriority spending in line ministries, reduce subsidies \nfor  electricity,  and  ration  kerosene  to  ensure  that  it  goes  only  to  the  poor.  In  May,  the \nGovernment  increased  fuel  prices  by  29%  across  the  board.  With  these  measures,  the \nGovernment\u2019s latest tentative projection for 2008 indicates a deficit of around 1.3%, lower than \nthe 1.9% deficit indicated at the start of the year. The Government is aware that, if the remaining \nsubsidies  are  not  removed  over  the  medium  term,  they  would  crowd  out  higher-priority \ninvestments in the social and infrastructure sectors that are needed to sustain Indonesia's long-\nterm growth and development objectives. The Government recognizes the need for further \nsteps towards reducing fuel subsidies.  \n \n5.  The Government is pursuing a pro-growth agenda while pushing forward on broad \nstructural and institutional reforms. Progress has been made on all fronts, although unevenly in \nsome areas. Despite recent improvements, there is a continued need to improve the investment \nclimate, public financial management, and service delivery mechanisms to the poor, which are \nsupported by ADB\u2019s development policy1 loan (DPSP) series. The IRSDP has allowed the \nGovernment to work with development partners in a flexible manner to implement critical high-\nlevel policy dialogue and cross-cutting sector reforms that address constraints to infrastructure \ndevelopment while providing predictability of financial support.  \n \n6.  The structure of Indonesia\u2019s financial sector and exports implies Indonesia is better \nequipped than some of its neighbors to confront the global economic downturn. The banking \nsector has limited direct exposure to developments in US financial markets, relatively low levels \nof nonperforming loans (3.4% in August 2008), and high capital adequacy ratios (17.1% in \nAugust 2008). The country is also less exposed to external shocks than other countries in the \nregion. At 50% of GDP, its trade share is relatively small, while the structure and destination of \nIndonesia\u2019s exports offers some protection to its external sector from the current downturn. \nAlmost  two-thirds  of  Indonesia\u2019s  exports  are  commodities,  the  prices  of  which  have  been \nrelatively strong but are now showing signs of weakness. Moreover, Indonesia\u2019s exports have \nbeen increasingly moving towards economies in Asia and away from the US (12.3% of total \nexports in 2007) and European Union (14.5% of total exports in 2007). GDP growth is expected \nto moderate to 6.2% in 2008 and 6.0% in 2009 as export growth slows with the global economic \ndownturn. Growth during this period will be sustained by robust domestic demand, especially \ninvestment and consumption demand. However, the possibility of a prolonged and more severe \nslump in the global economy holds considerable risks for Indonesia. On the other hand, further \nprogress in structural reforms and removing infrastructure bottlenecks could improve growth \nprojections. This makes the continuation of the IRSDP reform agenda to catalyze the required \ninfrastructure investments even more vital.  \n \nIII.  THE SECTOR: PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Sector Description and Performance \n7.  For many years before the 1997 Asian financial crisis, Indonesia successfully used \ninfrastructure development to support poverty reduction and economic development. However, \nthe financial shock resulted in cancellation or suspension of many planned public and private \ninfrastructure projects. Governments during 1998\u20132004 were burdened with the more urgent \ntasks  of  financial  sector  restructuring  and  fiscal  consolidation.  As  a  result,  infrastructure \ninvestments, which accounted for more than 6% of GDP before 1998, fell to a low of 2% in 2000 \nand  fluctuated  around  3%  in  2001\u20132006,  reflecting  a  sharp  decline  in  public  and  private \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2005. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nRepublic of Indonesia for the Development Policy Support Program. Manila \n ", "  3\nspending  (Figure  1).  Until  recently,  very  little  expansion  took  place,  with  just  some  basic \npreservation  and  maintenance  of  infrastructure.  Current  infrastructure  service  coverage  in \nIndonesia is accordingly low by regional standards. While Indonesia outperformed the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China, Sri Lanka, and Thailand in terms of overall infrastructure quality in 1996, 10 \nyears later these countries overtook Indonesia, which ranked 89 of the 125 countries surveyed.2 \nAbout 50 million people lack access to treated water, over 70 million lack access to electricity, \nand close to 200 million do not have direct access to telecommunications or connections to a \nsewerage network. The poor suffer disproportionately from lack of access. \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1: Infrastructure Investment in Indonesia \n \n \n \n8\n \n6.1\n  7\n \nP 6\nD  \n4.5\nG\n  5\nof \n  3.7\n  ent  4 3.6 3.2 3.3\n  rc 3  2.8 3.0 3.2\nPe 2.1\n \n2\n \n  1\n \n0\n  1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006\n \nNational Gov't Sub-national Gov't SOE Private  \n \nGov\u2019t = government, SOE =state owned enterprise. \n \nSource: World Bank. \n \n \n8.  The availability of infrastructure services in rural areas, particularly outside Java and \nBali,  is  well  below  the  national  average,  contributing  to  major  regional  disparities  in \ndevelopment. About 54% of rural villages are not connected to asphalt roads, and about one-\nthird of these lack year-round access even by four-wheel-drive vehicles. High transportation \ncosts are a major cause of poverty in these communities. Only 15% of rural households have \naccess to drinking water from piped or pumped sources, and just 21% have septic tanks for \ndisposal of human waste. The low levels of access to safe drinking water and lack of adequate \nsanitation  facilities  contribute  to  high  incidence  of  waterborne  diseases  such  as  diarrhea, \nintestinal worms, and skin diseases. The incidence is higher among children and the elderly, \nand diarrhea is the second-largest cause of death and stunted growth among young children. \nIndonesia\u2019s infant mortality rate is the highest among the Southeast Asian countries. \n \n9.    While the Asian financial crisis impeded development and growth in all of Southeast \nAsia, it has not been the sole reason for the poor state of infrastructure sectors in Indonesia. \nSupported by the economic boom prior to the crisis, investment decisions prior to the Asian \ncrisis were made on the basis of political connections rather than being a clear and impartial \njudgment of the associated risks, benefits, and costs. As a result, the public sector absorbed a \ndisproportionate share of the risks. In addition, no concerted effort was made to address the \n                                                 \n2  World Economic Forum. 2006. Global Competitiveness Report 2006\u20132007. Geneva. By contrast, Thailand was \nranked 38, People\u2019s Republic of China was ranked 60, and Sri Lanka was ranked 76. \n   ", "4    \nvarious policy, legal, and institutional impediments facing the infrastructure sectors. After the \ncrisis, Government efforts focused on risk mitigation by  renegotiating and canceling major \ninfrastructure  contracts  signed  in  the  previous  years,  rather  than  on  removing  those \nimpediments.  \n \n10.    Following  Indonesia\u2019s first  direct presidential  elections  in  October  2004,  the  current \nGovernment  set  the  following  ambitious  macroeconomic  targets  in  its  medium-term \ndevelopment program (RPJM) to be achieved by the end of its term in 2009: (i) accelerate GDP \ngrowth from 4.5% in 2003 to 7.6% (for an annual average of 6.6%), (ii) increase the investment-\nGDP ratio from 20.5% in 2003 to 28.4%, (iii) reduce the unemployment rate from 9.7% in 2004 \nto 5.1%, and (iv) halve the poverty rate from 16.6% in 2004 to 8.2%. From the outset, the \nGovernment identified the acceleration of infrastructure development as essential for achieving \nthese macroeconomic targets, and gave high priority to increasing access to infrastructure \nservices and improving the quality of these services. Since it was obvious that the estimated \ninvestment  requirements  would  far  exceed  the  available  public  sector  funding  (including \nmultilateral and bilateral aid), the Government called for major private sector participation (PSP) \nto bridge the gap. Public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs)\u2014contractual arrangements between the \npublic sector and a private sector company for the provision of an infrastructure service\u2014were \nchosen as the preferred approach for increasing PSP.  \n \n11.    In early 2005, the Government estimated that about $145 billion would be needed for \ninfrastructure expansion during 2005\u20132009. In 2006, based on updated assessments and more \nrealistic  forecasts  of  potential  investment  flows,  the  estimate  was  revised  down  to  about  \n$65 billion, with $25 billion (38%) to come from the Government budget, $14 billion (22%) from \ndomestic  banks  and  insurance  and  pension  funds,  $10  billion  (15%)  from  multilateral  and \nbilateral development partners, and $16 billion (25%) from domestic and foreign private sector \ninvestors. At this level, infrastructure investments would again reach about 5%\u20136% of GDP, \nconsidered to be the minimum required to restore pre-crisis levels of infrastructure provision and \nsupport the RPJM targets. \n \n12.    The Government has been aware of the urgent need to improve the investment climate \nthrough policy reforms that would (i) liberalize markets and allow competition from new entrants, \n(ii) strengthen regulatory arrangements, (iii) introduce tariff regimes based on full cost recovery \nor provide compensation to meet public service obligations (PSOs), and (iv) establish effective \nmechanisms for dispute resolution. At the Indonesia Infrastructure Summit (IIS) in Jakarta in \nJanuary 2005, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono led high-level Government officials in \nexpressing  the  political  will  to  accelerate  infrastructure  development  and  proceed  with  the \nnecessary reforms. At the subsequent Indonesia Infrastructure Conference and Exhibition in \nNovember 2006, this commitment was reiterated, and a number of reforms were presented that \nestablished the policy, legal, regulatory, and institutional framework for PPPs.  \n \n13.  At the Consultative Group on Indonesia meeting in January 2005, the Government \nasked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide medium-term support for infrastructure \nreforms and thereby help implement the RPJM. This request led to an intensification of ADB\u2019s \npolicy dialogue with the Government and other development partners. For the IIS, the three \nprincipal funding agencies\u2014ADB, the Japan International Cooperation Agency3 (JICA), and the \nWorld  Bank\u2014jointly  prepared  six  policy  briefs  on  issues  and  constraints  facing  the  main \ninfrastructure sectors, and on reforms needed to address these. Subsequently, in May 2005 the \ngovernments of Indonesia and Japan jointly adopted the strategic investment action plan, which \nincluded many infrastructure-related measures, to improve the investment climate. Building on \n                                                 \n3 Prior to October 2008, all discussions related to IRSDP were in conjunction with the Japan Bank for International \nCooperation (JBIC). For purposes of consistency, JBIC is now referred to as JICA in this RRP in line with the new \nstructure. \n ", "  5\nthese efforts, the Government took a range of critical steps to set the pace for reforms. In \nFebruary 2006, it released the infrastructure policy package listing 50 actions completed in \n2005, and 153 actions to be implemented during 2006. This was followed by the formulation of \nthe IRSDP by the Government and the three funding agencies, using the infrastructure policy \npackage as the starting point and expanding the reforms until 2010. In February 2007, a further \npolicy package was released by the Government in the form of presidential instruction 6/2007, \ncovering reforms planned until the end of 2007 in six areas including infrastructure. Finally, \npresidential instruction 5/2008, released in May 2008, has detailed reform actions and physical \nprojects to be completed during 2008\u20132009 in eight areas including infrastructure.  \n \n14.  As part of the discussions on ADB\u2019s country strategy and program,4 the Government \nasked ADB to work towards a credible medium-term commitment of resources to support one of \nthe proposed five main areas of engagement, namely, infrastructure and infrastructure services. \nThis has been further reinforced in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan5 for 2009\u20132011. The \nIRSDP structure as a 6-year program cluster was chosen to provide an overall umbrella for that \nkind of commitment.  \n \nB.  Issues and Opportunities \n1.  Issues \n15.  All sectors lag behind Indonesia\u2019s neighbors in terms of service coverage, and their \ninvestment requirements are much higher than the public sector can mobilize on its own. This \nunderlines  the  need  for  prioritization,  so  that  public  sector  resources  are  used  for  basic \ninfrastructure such as rural roads, rural electrification, and water supply and sanitation in rural \nand low-income urban areas, i.e., interventions of a noncommercial nature that have a strong \nimpact on poverty reduction. Financing from multilateral and bilateral development partners \nshould also be used for this purpose. The development partners also play an important role in \nassisting the Government to create an attractive environment for greater PSP, which is crucial \nfor meeting the massive investment requirements, and in attracting private sector investment for \ncommercially viable PPP projects. The IRSDP is helping Indonesia realize the potential for PSP \nand  leverage  public  sector  resources  to  reduce  service  coverage  gaps  by  removing  the \nimpediments and constraints described in Section 2 below and in Appendix 2.  \n \n2.  Legal and Regulatory Impediments \n16.  Inadequate Cross-Sector Framework for Private Sector Participation. To revive \nprivate investments in infrastructure, an effective legal framework is critical. The presidential \ndecree issued in the wake of the 1997 Asian financial crisis did not fulfill this purpose.6 Although \nit  defined  PSP  and  called  for  the  selection  of  private  sector  sponsors  through  open  and \ntransparent tendering, the decree adopted a simplistic approach and left many critical questions \nunanswered on PPP scope, implementation, performance norms, tariffs, and dispute resolution. \nIn the absence of an overall infrastructure law, a replacement of this decree by presidential \nregulation 67/2005 has been considered the best way to provide an adequate legal framework.  \n \n17.  Complex  Sector-Specific  Legal  and  Regulatory  Framework.  The  legal  and \nregulatory framework in Indonesia\u2019s infrastructure sectors is complex. Each sector has its own \nlaw, and the division of responsibilities for the five principal functions\u2014policy making, sector \nplanning, regulation, contracting, and operating\u2014differs greatly. While the line ministries in \n                                                 \n4 ADB. 2006. Country Strategy and Program (2006\u20142009): Indonesia. Manila. \n5 ADB. 2008.

Manila. \n6 Presidential decree 7/1998 on Cooperation between the Government and Private Companies in the Development \nand/or Management of Infrastructure.  \n   ", "6    \ncharge of infrastructure7 are uniformly responsible for policy making and sector planning, they \nsometimes  also  have  regulatory  responsibilities.  In  other  cases,  they  have  partly  or  fully \ndelegated  this  responsibility  to  recently  established  regulatory  bodies,  but  these  are  only \nnominally autonomous as they still report to the minister and are funded from the line ministry \nbudget. In some cases, the regulatory bodies also have contracting functions. In other cases, \nthe  contracting  function  is  undertaken  by  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs),  which  have  a \npervasive role across all the sectors and dominate sea and air transportation, railways, and \npower. Private enterprises have to compete with these well-established SOEs on a playing field \nthat is not even. The plethora of agencies involved and their complex interrelationships in sector \nfunctions  have  stymied  reforms  and  made  coordination  difficult.  Three  issues  need  to  be \naddressed: (i) the appropriate role of the Government and SOEs in the policy making, planning, \nregulatory,  contracting,  and  operating  functions,  (ii)  the  need  for  measures  to  make  the \nregulators independent, and (iii) the need for equal opportunities for private sector operators. \n \n3.  Resource Constraints Impeding Public and Private Investments \n18.  Lack of Focus on and Resources for Project Preparation. An important prerequisite \nfor PSP is adequacy and consistency of information needed for investment decisions. This has \nbeen constrained by lack of resources for sector planning, and line ministries and contracting \nagencies not focusing on project preparation. Before the Asian financial crisis, Indonesia had a \nwell-established  system  for  preparing  annual  and  medium-term  sector  plans  that  identified \ntargets for infrastructure provision and developed investment plans for achieving the targets. \nHowever, due to lack of resources for plan preparation\u2014and, more importantly, for actual public \ninvestment  in  infrastructure\u2014planning  capacity  in  some  sectors  has  been  eroded.  Sector \ndevelopment plans describing long-term physical expansion, and sector blueprints outlining a \nlong-term  vision  in  terms  of  restructuring  and  competition,  are  an  essential  element  in \ninvestment decisions. To prepare and regularly update such plans and blueprints, the planning \nfunctions and capacity of line ministries need to be strengthened in accordance with the gradual \nshift in the role of the Government from service provider to policy maker, planner, coordinator, \nand facilitator. Lack of capacity and resources and the absence of a systematic process have \nalso led to lack of attention to project preparation. While the budget system does allow line \nministries  and  agencies  to  obtain  some  resources  for  preparing  feasibility  studies,  the \nwidespread view is that, for PPP projects, this work should be done by the private sector \nsponsors.  Once  projects  are  identified  and  some  preparation  done,  the  critical  steps  of \nprocurement and transaction execution also generally suffer from resource constraints. Given \nthe high degree of autonomy of line ministries, strong central coordination is needed to ensure a \nconsistent approach to PSP across infrastructure sectors and efficient use of available funds. \n \n19.    Lack  of  a  Sound  Risk  Management  Framework.  In  the  first  half  of  the  1990s, \nunsolicited  project  proposals  from  politically connected  private  sector  parties  created  large \npublic sector liabilities, particularly in the power sector, that were highlighted by the 1997 \nfinancial crisis. The subsequent administrations therefore became reluctant to offer support to \nprivate sector investors. More recently, the Government has recognized the importance of \nadequate  risk  mitigation  and  sharing  to  attract  major  PSP.  A  sound  investment  climate, \nsupported  by  reduced  investor  perception  of  corruption,  would  be  the  best  risk  mitigation \nmechanism. This would entail continuous and sustained policy reforms that lead to a stable \nmacroeconomic  environment,  well-functioning  judicial  system,  independent  and  technically \nsound regulation, full cost recovery in infrastructure services (or a well-targeted output-based \nsubsidy where the full cost recovery would make such services unaffordable), and open access \nin the infrastructure sectors. During the transition before these ideal conditions are achieved and \n                                                 \n7  The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources for oil, gas, and power; Ministry of Public Works for roads and water \nsupply and sanitation; Ministry of Transportation for ports, airports, and railways; and Ministry of Communications \nand Informatics for telecommunications. \n ", "  7\nconfidence fully restored, private investors will ask for Government support to help mitigate risks \nthat are not under their control. The principal lesson is that the previous practice of blanket \nguarantees should not be repeated. The various risks in each sector and for each project type \nneed to be identified, and then allocated to the participant that can best control them. No \nuniversal solution is applicable to all situations, and the range of possible solutions is wide, \ndepending on the specific circumstances of each case. The provision of adequate resources to \nSOEs to fulfill their PSOs is one way of mitigating the potential default risk of those entities. The \nother important lesson is that risk allocation should not be rigid. Risks should gradually be \ntransferred  from  the  public  sector  to  private  investors  as  conditions  improve,  until  market \ninstruments rather than government guarantees can be used for risk hedging. \n \n20.    Inadequate Cost Recovery. Given the multiplicity of agencies involved, and with SOEs \nplaying a key role in many sectors, tariffs for infrastructure services are usually administered. \nMost notably for power, oil and gas, and air transport, national or local parliamentary approval or \npresidential regulations with parliamentary consensus are needed for tariff increases. Despite a \nseries of increases in electricity tariffs, domestic oil prices, and transportation tariffs since 2000, \nfull cost recovery has not yet been achieved, mainly because of escalating international oil \nprices. Adopting the full cost recovery principle is essential to encouraging greater PSP and \nenhancing efficiency in the allocation of resources. At the same time, the ability of the poor to \npay for infrastructure services needs to be considered. \n \n21.    Failure to Achieve Equity and Efficiency in Public Service Obligations. Full cost \nrecovery can only be achieved gradually. Even in the long term, low-income customers may not \nbe able to pay the required tariffs for infrastructure services, and there are limitations on cross \nsubsidization by more affluent customer categories. The current situation differs from sector to \nsector, with no uniform PSO approach. Loss-making port and airport facilities are either cross \nsubsidized in SOE portfolios or are left to line ministries to operate and finance from their \nbudget. In the power sector, the State Electricity Corporation (PLN) receives a huge annual \nsubsidy from the Government budget, as the current electricity tariffs are below PLN\u2019s cost of \nsupply in all consumer categories. Low tariffs for water supply result in the poor financial \ncondition and high indebtedness of the regional water supply enterprises (PDAMs) that are \nowned by local governments. The Government also provides annual subsidies for the so-called \npioneer services in bus, railway, ship, and air transport. In the telecommunications sector, a \nportion of revenues of private companies is retained for subsidized rural services. To achieve \ngreater PSP and higher efficiencies in PSO provision, a consistent cross-sector PSO framework \nis needed. While the public sector will continue to have an important role in delivering many \nnoncommercial services, innovative approaches allowing PSP could include output-based aid \nthat is explicit, targeted, and driven by the service provider\u2019s performance.  \n \n22.    Shallow Domestic Financing Modalities. Banking plays a dominant role within the \nfinancial system. Capital markets have grown in importance, but long-term debt issuance has \nuntil recently been limited to government bonds. The issuance of corporate bonds has been \ngradually growing, but only a small portion originates from SOEs operating in the infrastructure \nsectors. On the supply side, contractual savings institutions such as pension and insurance \ncompanies have traditionally invested predominantly in government bonds or bank deposits. \nWhile the Government estimates that domestic financial institutions can meet about 20% of the \ninfrastructure funding requirements, concerted reforms are needed to help mobilize domestic \nresources of this magnitude. Domestic financing would help reduce the currency mismatch and \nthe extent of government guarantees for PPP projects. The Government needs to facilitate the \ndevelopment of local financial and capital markets by (i) enabling insurance firms and pension \nfunds to finance infrastructure, (ii) deepening the bond market, (iii) setting up sound credit-rating \nagencies, (iv) establishing dedicated infrastructure funds, and (v) allowing regional governments \nto borrow for infrastructure in local markets. \n   ", "8    \n4.  Other Constraints Impeding Infrastructure Development \n23.    Weak Legal, Regulatory, and Implementation Framework for Land Acquisition. \nLand acquisition problems have impeded a number of infrastructure projects, particularly toll \nroads. Until 2005, land acquisition was governed by the old Basic Agrarian Law and presidential \nregulation 55/1993 on Land Acquisition for Public Infrastructure. While providing a legal basis, \nthese documents failed to balance the need to protect social safeguards with regard to the need \nfor expeditious provision of land or right-of-way access for infrastructure development. As the \ncost of land is generally high, an effective mechanism to finance land acquisition in a timely \nmanner and prevent speculation is essential. In many countries, land acquisition for large \ninfrastructure PPP projects is done by the public sector as its contribution to project investment \ncosts.  \n \n24.    Lack  of  Clarity  Due  to  Regional  Autonomy.  Decentralization,  while  devolving \nconsiderable authority and autonomy to local governments, has complicated matters related to \ninfrastructure  development.  Until  recently,  responsibility  for  the  provision  of  infrastructure \nservices and the role of local-government-owned enterprises (BUMDs) has not been clearly \narticulated. Local governments, with control over local infrastructure, have not been provided \nwith adequate funds and most lack the necessary capacity.  \n \n25.    Safety, Security, and Asset Maintenance. Access and connectivity are vital in the \nIndonesian  archipelago.  Adherence  to  safety  and  security  standards  for  various  modes  of \ntransportation is equally critical. The Government recently began adopting safety and security \nnorms,  and  establishing  the  necessary  institutional  mechanisms.  In  the  road  sector, \nmaintenance gets varying levels of attention across the country, with national and provincial \nroads reasonably well preserved but district and urban roads in poor condition due to gross \nunderspending on maintenance. Safety norms for road use and vehicle overloading are only \nslowly emerging, and enforcement is weak. Safety is also an issue for air and sea transportation \ndue  to  disparities  in  the  adoption  of  safety  norms  across  the  country  and  ineffective \nenforcement.  \n \n5.  Summary of Constraints and Impediments \n26.    Poor Governance and Resource Constraints. In the aftermath of the 1997 financial \ncrisis, four facets of governance that impede infrastructure development have emerged: (i) \nabsence of sound PSP policies and framework, (ii) opaqueness in tendering, and corruption and \nrent-seeking during implementation affecting both public and private sectors, (iii) inequality in \naccess  to  opportunities  by  the  public  and  private  sector,  and  (iv)  weak  cross-sector \ncoordination. The impact of poor governance has been aggravated by the following fiscal and \nother resource-related impediments affecting public and private investments in infrastructure: (i) \ndeclining  institutional  capacity  for  sector  planning,  (ii)  lack  of  focus  on,  and  inadequate \nresources allocated to, project preparation, (iii) lack of risk sharing, (iv) lack of cost recovery, \nwhich threatens the financial viability of projects, (v) inability of the public sector to finance land \nacquisition, and (vi) lack of long-term financial intermediation. Appendix 3 shows links between \nthe various constraints and impediments addressed by the IRSDP.  \n \n6.  Lessons  \n27.    In terms of lending modalities, the Government has shown strong preference for policy-\nbased budget support. ADB has responded to this preference. During 2005\u20132007, program \nloans accounted for $2.0 billion, or over 70%, of ADB\u2019s total lending commitments of about $2.8 \nbillion. At this magnitude, it has been imperative that lessons borne out by past operations of \nthis type be taken into account. The role of program lending as a vehicle for economic growth \n ", "  9\nand poverty reduction was examined in several studies,8 leading to the following principal \nconclusions and recommendations: (i) policy frameworks were often complex and unrealistic, (ii) \na high degree of formal compliance with conditions did not necessarily lead to high-quality \ncompliance in terms of reform implementation and sustainability, (iii) political economy factors \nsuch as the commitment to (and timing of) reforms, the extent of the underlying problems, \nappreciation by the public of the seriousness of these problems, and length of the government \nterm, were critical, (iv) broader stakeholder participation was vital to obtain adequate buy-in and \nmitigate vested interests, (v) mere adoption of policies and passage of laws was not enough\u2014\ntheir implementation was equally important, (vi) policy measures should focus on the main \nobjectives  of  the  program,  and  each  action  should  be  specific  and  directly  related  to  the \nobjectives, (vii) to provide the necessary flexibility, program design should allow not only the \nstandard multitranche operations, but also options with a single tranche, floating tranches, and a \nprogram cluster, (viii) reforms should be phased in and fully aligned with the country\u2019s broader \nmedium-term development agenda, and (ix) funding agencies should harmonize and coordinate \ntheir policy advice and operations. \n \n28.  A program cluster modality with three single-tranche subprograms anchored on the \nGovernment\u2019s medium-term reform agenda (RPJM) has been adopted since the start of the \nIRSDP series. ADB\u2019s experience with single-tranche program loans in Indonesia has been \neffective, as the loan disbursement is based on a range of up-front actions taken by the \nGovernment in the core areas of infrastructure. This approach provides the flexibility to an \nemerging middle-income country such as Indonesia to build consensus for reforms resulting in a \nnatural progression from actions to desired outcomes.   \n \n29.  With one exception, the above lessons and recommendations have been reflected in \nthe IRSDP design and implementation. Because of the wide range of infrastructure sectors and \nthe need to cover several thematic areas in each of them, it has not been possible to design a \nsimple  policy  matrix  that  would  ensure  the  desired  outcome  of  increasing  infrastructure \ninvestments to 6%\u20137% of GDP. Incorporating the other lessons, the IRSDP supports the RPJM, \nits policy-based component is anchored on the Government\u2019s Infrastructure Policy Package to \nensure strong ownership, and it has been formulated and implemented in close cooperation with \nJICA and the World Bank. The general public experiences the infrastructure bottlenecks and the \npoor quality of infrastructure services on a daily basis. Consequently, the majority of people \nsupport the reforms, as demonstrated by their acceptance of the steep oil price increases in \n2005 and 2008. Nevertheless, the reform agenda is broad and challenging as it covers all \ninfrastructure sectors, and some vested interests oppose parts of it.  \n \n30.    To allow the necessary flexibility in reform implementation, the program cluster model \nconsisting  of  three  single-tranche  subprograms  has  been  adopted  for  the  IRSDP.  The \nsuccessful implementation of subprograms 1 and 2 has confirmed the advantages of this model. \nDespite its large scope and complexity, the IRSDP has proven to be manageable and the \nGovernment\u2019s ownership of it remains strong. This has been attributable to the fact that, unlike \nmultitranche programs that provide an incentive to implement agreed future reforms in several \nstages within a predetermined time frame, single-tranche programs provide an incentive for \nagreed completed reforms. This structure removes the rigidity of firm deadlines for actions \noutside the Government\u2019s control, such as legislative approvals, and helps deflect criticisms that \nthe reforms are a result of external pressure. The subprogram 2 and 3 loans have been \nsubmitted to ADB\u2019s Board for approval only after the agreed actions had been completed (rather \nthan up front as in the case of the second and third tranches of multitranche programs). The \nreform  agenda  and  its  timing  have  been  periodically  reviewed  in  light  of  the  actual \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2001.

Traditionally, ADB, JICA, and the World Bank have been the Government\u2019s principal \ndevelopment  partners  in  the  infrastructure  sectors.  Given  the  importance  of  infrastructure \nreforms for the RPJM, in early 2006 the Government asked the Government of Japan and the \nWorld  Bank  to  cofinance  the  IRSDP.  The  former  responded  positively  and  JICA  actively \nparticipated in all processing missions in 2006. As the infrastructure-related elements of the \nstrategic investment action plan (para. 13) were incorporated in the IRSDP, the Government of \nJapan adopted its policy matrix and approved cofinancing of $100 million in March 2007, 4 \nmonths after ADB\u2019s approval of the $400 million loan for subprogram 1. For programming and \nother reasons, the World Bank was unable to process its contribution in 2006, but its staff \nparticipated as observers in the ADB\u2013JICA missions and made a number of useful suggestions \nthat  were  incorporated  into  the  IRSDP  policy  matrix.  Processing  of  the  World  Bank\u2019s \nInfrastructure Development Policy Loan (IDPL) took place 1 year later and was completed by \nthe approval of the $200 million IDPL 1 in December 2007. The design and implementation of \nthe IRSDP reform measures have greatly benefited from the close cooperation of the three \ninstitutions. \n \n32.    For the second-stage operations in 2008, the processing of the subprogram 2 loans \nfrom ADB and the Government of Japan has been synchronized with that of IDPL 2. A joint \nreview of the status of reforms was undertaken in April 2008. Board consideration by the World \nBank will take place in December 2008 and by the Government of Japan in March 2009. \n \n33.  Technical assistance (TA) support for capacity development, risk management, and \npreparation of PPP projects has been provided in a similarly coordinated way. In 2004 the World \nBank  approved  a  $16.5  million  loan  for  the  Private  Provision  of  Infrastructure  Technical \nAssistance, while 1 year later ADB provided a $2 million TA grant as the precursor to the \nIRSDP.9 To avoid any duplication of work, the World Bank\u2019s support has been directed at the \nCoordinating  Ministry  of  Economic  Affairs  (CMEA),  Ministry  of  Public  Works  (MPW),  and \nMinistry of Transportation (MOT), while ADB has supported the National Development Planning \nAgency (BAPPENAS). There has also been a clear delineation of areas of support in ADB\u2019s \nfollow-up TA under the third component of the IRSDP (para. 39). Appendix 4 contains the \ndevelopment partner coordination matrix, outlining support in areas related to the IRSDP. \n \n8.  Rationale and Linkage with Other ADB Assistance \n34.    The IRSDP design and implementation have been closely coordinated with ongoing and \nplanned ADB programs and projects. It is consistent with ADB\u2019s CSP for 2006\u20132009, which is \nanchored on support for the RPJM. The CSP adopts a dual-track approach to ensure that cross-\ncutting macroeconomic and governance reforms complement, and are reinforced by, sector \nreforms. Appendix 5 presents this approach of providing support through (i) participation in the \nWorld Bank\u2019s Development Policy Loan (DPL) series to strengthen the macroeconomic and \nfiscal framework while addressing cross-cutting issues such as governance, and (ii) sector-\nspecific policy interventions in the areas of infrastructure, financial markets, local government \nfinance, and poverty reduction, and accelerated progress towards the Millennium Development \nGoals.  \n \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Indonesia for Support for Infrastructure Development. Manila. \n ", " 11\n35.    ADB  has  adopted  a  holistic  approach  to  supporting  infrastructure  development  in \nIndonesia. Complementing the IRSDP in improving the overall investment climate are ADB\u2019s \nDPSP program, while the deepening of capital markets is covered by ADB\u2019s capital market \ndevelopment  program10.  Project  preparation  and  the  related  institutional  and  capacity \ndevelopment are supported by the project development facility (PDF) and associated TA (para. \n39). Finally, the support extends to infrastructure finance in the form of assistance through \nsupport  to  Bank  Mandiri  for  long-term  infrastructure  funding,  and  to  nonbanking  financial \ninstitutions, through establishment and capitalization of the Indonesian Infrastructure Financing \nFacility (IIFF) (para. 53). \n \n36.    The CSP envisages stronger support for private sector development through a close link \nbetween ADB\u2019s public and private sector operations. The IRSDP focuses on PSP and is well \naligned with ADB\u2019s growing private sector operations in Indonesia.11 Conversely, lessons from \nthe design and implementation of private sector projects are fed into reforms covered by the \nIRSDP that enhance project sustainability by strengthening the policy, legal, and regulatory \nframework, particularly in the power, toll road, and gas sectors. The IIFF is an example of a \ndirect outcome of these reforms. \n \n37.    The IRSDP, which focuses on facilitating medium- and large-scale PPP projects at the \nnational and local government levels, is balanced by ADB\u2019s support for small community-driven \ninfrastructure projects in rural areas.12 \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROGRAM \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n38.    By enhancing infrastructure provision and access, the IRSDP aims to improve the \ninvestment climate in Indonesia and support timely realization of the Government\u2019s medium-\nterm macroeconomic goals articulated in the RPJM, in particular achieving average annual GDP \ngrowth of 6%\u20137% during 2005\u20132009 and sustaining such growth thereafter. This will enable the \nGovernment to reduce poverty and boost job creation. The expected outcome of the IRSDP is \naccelerated infrastructure development through major PSP and mobilization and allocation of \nadditional public sector resources. Appendix 6 presents the Government\u2019s letter of development \npolicy, which reiterates its commitment to infrastructure reforms, along with updated policy \nmatrixes for the IRSDP and IDPL, which detail these parallel operations and show their current \nstatus. \n \nB.  Scope \n39.  The IRSDP cluster concept and the following IRSDP components were approved by the \nADB Board in November 2006. Approval of the $100 million cofinancing for subprogram 1 by \nthe Government of Japan followed in March 2007. \n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2007.

Manila. \n11  In  December  2005,  $350  million  for  the Tangguh  Liquefied  Natural  Gas  Project,  the  largest  loan  without \ngovernment guarantee in ADB\u2019s history, was approved. In August 2006, ADB approved a $75 million loan for the \nSouth Sumatra\u2013West Java Gas Pipeline Project, and in August 2007 approved a rupiah-denominated loan \nequivalent to $50 million for the West Java Water Supply Development Project. \n12 ADB. 2005.

The PDF has been designed to remove one of the most critical constraints currently \nimpeding infrastructure development, namely, the lack of adequate project preparation. It is \nhelping the Government prepare feasibility studies for national and local PPP projects, adopt an \nopen and transparent tendering process, and execute project transactions up to the stage of \nfinancial closure. The consulting services financed under the PDF through the combination of \nthe ADF loan and Dutch grant also assist in overall PPP project promotion and the related \ncapacity  building  at  the  central  and  local  government  level.  The  TA  focuses  on  effective \nimplementation of the new risk-management framework, capacity building for establishing and \nmanaging the IIFF, effective communication and social marketing of the reform agenda to a \nwide range of stakeholders, and start-up activities for the PDF.   \n \nC.  Important Features \n41.  The IRSDP has a number of important features. First, its overall design is fully in line \nwith the Government\u2019s medium-term development growth vision, as articulated in the RPJM, \nand the Government\u2019s infrastructure reform agenda, as formulated in the infrastructure policy \npackage. Second, designed as a program cluster consisting of three subprograms, the IRSDP \nprovides the necessary flexibility to an emerging middle-income country like Indonesia that is \ngoing through democratic and political transition for it to build consensus for reforms among \nstakeholders with competing interests. It also ensures continuity of reforms resulting in a natural \nprogression from actions to desired outcomes. \n  \n42.  Third,  the  IRSDP  helps  address  investment  climate  impediments,  a  major  area  of \nconcern in Indonesia. The IRSDP\u2019s focus on accelerating infrastructure provision will in turn \npromote  and  facilitate  other  investments  in  other  sectors.  Several  surveys  show  that  the \ninadequate  provision  and  poor  quality  of  infrastructure  services,  and  disparities  in  service \ncoverage, are major impediments to increasing domestic and foreign investments in Indonesia. \nFulfilling PSOs is a key cross-cutting area that has an indirect impact in terms of attracting \ninvestments in the future. As the Indonesian economy grows and investments increase, the \nwidespread  disparities  in  development  across  the  country  must  be  addressed.  Reducing \npotential  discontent  among  the  poor  and  other  vulnerable  segments  of  the  population  is \nparticularly relevant in underserved areas with significant natural resource potential. Fourth, in a \nthematic sense, the principal focus of the IRSDP is to strengthen governance and alleviate \nresource constraints in infrastructure provision. Box 1 highlights the focus on governance.  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n13 ADB. 2006.

The \nProgram supports the formulation and/or adoption of the following:  \n \n\u2022  A legal and regulatory framework that provides for transparent and competitive tendering to \nselect private sector partners, even for unsolicited proposals. \n\u2022  A risk-sharing framework which focuses on project quality and transparency in deciding on \nthe type and amount of Government support, stipulates that such support can be provided \nonly if indicated in the bidding documents, and ensures that the overall level of Government \nsupport is in line with sound fiscal management. \n\u2022  Gradual dismantling of state-owned enterprise monopolies and creation of a level playing \nfield in as many infrastructure sectors as feasible.  \n\u2022  Sector-specific measures to deal with corruption, such as adoption of standard bidding \ndocuments and e-procurement in the road sector.  \n\u2022  Preparation and transaction execution in a transparent and competitive manner for \nthe model public\u2013private partnership projects to demonstrate the merits of the new \nprivate sector participation and risk-management frameworks. \n \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n \n \n43.    Finally, there are close links between the IRSDP as formulated in 2005 and the IDPL as \ndesigned 2 years later. While the IRSDP covers a broad range of reforms, the World Bank\u2019s \ndevelopment policy loan model allows only a limited number of triggers. The World Bank has \ntherefore focused on a small subset of high-priority reforms in the areas of national public \ninfrastructure,  subnational  government  infrastructure,  private  infrastructure  investment,  and \ncross-cutting infrastructure governance issues. The separate interventions complement each \nother, with the ADB and Japanese IRSDP loan series helping maintain momentum across the \nbreadth  of  the  Government\u2019s  reform  agenda,  and  the  World  Bank\u2019s  IDPL  series  ensuring \nheightened attention to the most critical reforms. In identifying a more limited set of triggers, the \nWorld Bank supports reform elements that either reinforce the IRSDP policy matrix or expand it. \nThere  has  been  close  coordination  between  the  three  development  partners  to  ensure \nconsistent messages are given to the Government. \n \nD.  Policy Reforms \n1.  Reform Framework and Objectives \n44.    The IRSDP policy framework is founded on three reform pillars:  \n \n(i)  Strategic cross-sector reforms will result in \n(a)  an improved policy, legal, and institutional framework for PSP anchored \non good-governance principles; \n(b)  an  improved  coordination  mechanism  for  ministries  and  agencies \ninvolved in infrastructure development; \n(c)   a well-structured risk management framework that promotes PSP;  \n   ", "14    \n(d)  accelerated mobilization of domestic long-term financial resources for \ninfrastructure  development  and  establishment  of  innovative  funding \nmechanisms for PPP projects; and \n(e)  a  streamlined  regional  autonomy  framework,  clearly  delineating \nfunctional  responsibilities  of  the  national  and  local  governments  in \ninfrastructure provision. \n \n(ii)  Sector-specific policy, legal, and institutional reforms covering eight infrastructure \nsectors14 will lead to   \n \n(a)  better sector planning and project preparation; \n(b)  improved financial soundness and sustainability of infrastructure services \nthrough full cost recovery; \n(c)  greater competition that benefits consumers through improved service \ndelivery and lower tariffs; \n(d)  independent regulatory structures that are distinct from the contracting \nand operating functions; \n(e)  equal  access  and  opportunities  for  all  participants  and  prevention  of \nabuse of natural monopoly rights; and \n(f)  fulfillment  of  the  PSO  in  infrastructure  provision  in  line  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s poverty reduction objectives.  \n \n(iii)  Facilitation of the preparation and execution of well-structured PPP transactions \nwill result in sound model infrastructure projects that can be replicated. \n \n45.

Strategic Cross-Sector Reforms \n46.  Legal Framework to Promote Private Sector Participation. Under subprogram 1, the \nGovernment issued presidential regulation 67/2005 on Cooperation between the Government \nand Business Entities in the Provision of Infrastructure to establish a clear and predictable \nenvironment  within  which  private  investors  would  operate.  Presidential  regulation  67/2005 \ndefined two forms of PSP, namely, partnership and licensing agreements. PPP projects can be \nidentified and prepared either by the Government or the private sector, but the sponsors must \n   ", "16    \nbe selected through open and transparent tendering. Tariffs should be set at full cost-recovery \nlevel. If this exceeds the ability of consumers to pay, the Government must compensate for the \ndifference with a PSO subsidy. Risks should be allocated to the party that is best able to \nmanage and control them. \n \n47.  With these principles, presidential regulation 67/2005 has proved to be a cornerstone of \ninfrastructure reforms. However, during its implementation under subprogram 2, the lack of \nclarity in some provisions and gaps in others has become evident. Through the TA (footnote 9), \nADB has therefore supported the revision of clauses related to the definition of contracting \nagency, form and scope of Government support, definition of financial closure, responsibility for \npublic consultations, role of local governments, and number of re-bidding rounds. There have \nalso been proposals to amend the procedure and rules for selecting private sector partners, in \nthe belief that it would expedite transaction execution. To avoid diluting the principles of project \nquality, transparency, and competition, ADB and the World Bank have held intensive policy \ndialogue with the Government such that the revision of presidential regulation 67/2005 will \nmaintain the fundamental principles. \n \n48.    Institutional  and  Coordination  Arrangements  for  Private  Sector  Participation. \nPresidential regulation 42/2005 enhanced the ability of the interministerial National Committee \nfor  the  Acceleration  of  Infrastructure  Provision  (KKPPI)15  to  fulfill  its  role  in  (i)  formulating \ninfrastructure strategies and policies, (ii) coordinating and supervising their implementation by \nthe line ministries and local governments, (iii) formulating PSO policy for infrastructure services, \nand (iv) solving problems that impede infrastructure development, in particular PPP projects. To \nensure  effective  functioning  of  KKPPI,  its  secretariat,  headed  by  the  deputy  minister  for \ninfrastructure and regional development in CMEA (in charge of administrative matters and \nstakeholder consultations) and the deputy minister for infrastructure affairs in BAPPENAS (in \ncharge of technical matters), needed sustained capacity building and advisory support. \n \n49.    For about 2 years under subprogram 2, ADB provided the required support to the \nBAPPENAS part of the KKPPI secretariat through TA (footnote 9), while the CMEA part has \nbeen supported by the World Bank\u2019s Private Provision of Infrastructure Technical Assistance \nloan. Coordination of the two parts has been improved by (i) the creation of the positions of an \nexecutive secretary and administrative manager filled by nongovernment staff who reviewed the \nstructure  and  operations  of  the  KKPPI  secretariat,  (ii)  the  demarcation  of  responsibilities \nbetween BAPPENAS and CMEA, and (iii) the work program for KKPPI. Based on this review, a \nnumber of measures related to institutional arrangements, standard operating procedures, and \npriority agenda for KKPPI are being taken. These efforts have borne fruit, as evidenced by the \nmore proactive role played by KKPPI and its secretariat. For the future day-to-day coordination \nand management of PPP transactions as their number increases, a network consisting of a \ncentral PPP unit under the KKPPI secretariat and PPP nodes in the line ministries has been \npartly developed. There are already PPP nodes in some line ministries that are responsible for \nproject preparation and transaction execution. The network will be completed and become \noperational under subprogram 3. \n \n50.    Risk Management Framework. In view of the links to its existing budgeting, fiscal \naccounting, and debt management systems, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) has played an \nimportant role in developing and implementing this framework as an instrument for assessing, \npricing, monitoring, and managing contingent liabilities that arise from selective guarantees for \nPPP projects against risks related to policies and performance of the Government and its \n                                                 \n15  KKPPI, which reports directly to the president, is co-chaired by the coordinating minister of economic affairs and \nthe chairperson of BAPPENAS, the latter acting as the executive chair. Its members include the ministers of \nfinance, home affairs, energy and mineral resources, public works, transportation, communications and informatics, \nand state-owned enterprises, as well as the cabinet secretary.  \n ", " 17\nagencies. Under subprogram 1, regulation 38/2006 on risk management policy was issued to \nensure that risks of individual PPP projects were appropriately allocated between the public and \nprivate sectors, and that the Government\u2019s overall exposure was well managed. The declared \nobjective  of  the  policy  was  to  support  infrastructure  development  while  maintaining  fiscal \nsustainability of the government budget. Regulation 38/2006 described the types of risks the \nGovernment might consider sharing (those related to political events, project performance, and \ndemand), the main principles for providing such support (legality, project quality in terms of \ntechnical and financial feasibility, fiscal prudence in terms of total exposure and annual budget, \nand transparency), and approval procedures. To implement regulation 38/2006, a permanent \nrisk management unit (RMU) was established in MOF.  \n \n51.    Under subprogram 2, the RMU has become fully operational in terms of functions, \nbudget, staffing, and operational procedures, with support provided through the TA attached to \nthe IRSDP (para. 39). The RMU has reviewed a number of PPP proposals for government \nsupport submitted by the line ministries and agencies, particularly in the road and transportation \nsectors. In doing so, it has upheld the principles stipulated in regulation 38/2006, including the \ntransparency principle requiring that any request for government support must be submitted \nbefore tendering. In the 2008 budget, Rp745 billion has been allocated for such support for toll \nroads, and Rp300 billion for power projects. In addition, an initial allocation of Rp1.05 trillion has \nbeen provided for the newly established Government Investment Center, and a policy paper has \nbeen prepared by MOF on a guarantee fund to provide backing for government support, with \nthe view to establishing such fund under subprogram 3. \n \n52.    Innovative Financing Models and Mechanisms. Under subprogram 1, MOF prepared \na policy paper outlining measures needed to mobilize resources through various models and \nmechanisms in order to provide financing for PPP projects. The paper covered the entire \nspectrum of financing needs, from project preparation to implementation, for both public and \nprivate investments and guarantees. Given the weaknesses in project preparation that have \nimpeded execution of PPP transactions, establishment of the PDF has been given priority under \nsubprogram 2. After a slow start, the PDF is now fully operational and the pipeline of national \nand regional projects seeking its funding for feasibility studies and transaction advisory services \nis growing.16 \n \n53.    Under subprogram 2, preparations have also been made to offer financing to private \nand public sponsors of PPP projects. Based on Government regulation 66/2007 proposes that a \ngovernment holding company be  established under MOF and provided with Rp1 trillion in \nequity. About 60% of this is expected to be invested by the holding company in the IIFF, a \nnonbank financial institution modeled after the Infrastructure Development Financing Company \ncreated in India in 1996 with ADB assistance, which will provide long-term local currency debt \nand  equity  to  project  sponsors.  ADB  and  the  World  Bank  Group  are  processing  equity \ninvestments in the IIFF and loans to the Government to fund its subordinate debt. JICA and \nKreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau (the Credit Institute for Reconstruction) are also considering \nfinancing for the IIFF, which will become operational under subprogram 3. \n \n54.    Land Acquisition. Under subprogram 1, intensive stakeholder review and feedback, \nincluding  comments  from  international  investors,  resulted  in  the  adoption  of  presidential \nregulation 65/2006 to amend presidential regulation 36/2005.17 Together, the two regulations \n                                                 \n16 About 40% of the combined loan and grant resources of the PDF of $34.1 million have already been committed for \nvarious consulting contracts. \n17  Replacing presidential regulation 55/1993 on land acquisition for public infrastructure and providing for independent \nvaluation of property to reduce opportunity for speculation; expanding the definition of public interest to areas such \nas piped water, power transmission lines, and sanitary landfills; and clarifying the period of negotiations before any \nrecourse by expropriation can be sought. \n   ", "18    \nmoved  the  Government\u2019s  policies  on  land  acquisition  closer  to  internationally  accepted \nprinciples on involuntary resettlement, particularly with regard to provisions on the use of market \nprices and recognition of nonphysical losses. For projects serving public interest, expropriation \nafter 120 days\u2014excluding the time required for identification, valuation, and notification\u2014is \nallowed if no agreement is reached with the landowner.  \n \n55.    During  subprogram  2,  an  analysis  of  the  remaining  gaps  between  the  new  land \nacquisition framework and international best practices, such as the Equator Principles,18 has \nbeen carried out with assistance from the World Bank and ADB. The analysis has focused on \nlivelihood restoration, consultation, grievance redress, and rights of squatters, and some of its \nrecommendations have been taken into account by decree 3/2007 of the National Land Agency \n(BPN) when issuing implementing regulations for the two presidential regulations.19 However, \nland acquisition continues to be a stumbling block for PPP projects, particularly toll roads (para. \n63). As agreed under the World Bank\u2019s IDPL, a land working group chaired by BPN is to review \nthe current policy and implementation of land acquisition, and prepare policy and operational \nrecommendations  and  an  action  plan  to  accelerate  the  process  while  ensuring  fair \ncompensation. The objective is to formulate a long-term approach\u2014the so-called land banking \nthrough  zoning  and  purchase\u2014for  securing  land  well  in  advance  of  tendering  to  avoid \nspeculation. \n \n56.    Intergovernmental  Coordination.  The  issues  related  to  intergovernmental  fiscal \nrelations, local government borrowing (including onlending and on-granting of foreign loans by \nthe  central  government  to  local  governments),  and  restructuring  of  local  government  debt \narrears, have been addressed by strengthening the relevant legal framework. As shown in \nAppendix 5, these efforts have been supported by other policy-based operations. The World \nBank has done so through its development policy loan series. In addition to cofinancing the \ndevelopment  policy  loans,  ADB  has  provided  such  support  through  the  second  local \ngovernment finance and governance reform program cluster series.20 Under subprogram 2 of \nthe IRSDP, national and local government responsibilities in infrastructure provision, operation, \ncontracting, and regulating have been clarified through Government regulation 38/2007.21 These \ndecentralization principles have also been reflected in the new laws on railways, shipping, \naviation,  road  traffic  and  transportation,  energy,  and  electricity,  as  well  as  in  the  related \ngovernment regulations. \n \n57.    Public Service Obligation Policy. The PSO policy is an important thematic area that \ncuts across all infrastructure sectors. PSO activities are currently being delivered under two \nbroad categories: (i) those assigned to SOEs and regulated under the SOE law, and (ii) those \nknown as \u201cpioneering services\u201d in the transportation sector that include assignments to both \nSOEs and PSP in service delivery through tendered contracts. The expansion of activities that \nare subsidized by the Government and the sharp increase in the amount of subsidies has \nunderlined the need to clarify the PSO definition and standardize approaches to PSO planning \nand implementation. Under subprogram 2 and with the TA support (footnote 9), the current \n                                                 \n18 These are a set of environmental and social benchmarks for managing environmental and social issues in \ndevelopment project finance. More than 60 banks have adopted the Equator Principles, which have become the de \nfacto standard for banks and investors on how to assess major development projects around the world. \n19 The other recommendations will be considered when formulating a new land law that would replace the Basic \nAgrarian Law of 1973, for which a TA project is being processed by ADB. \n20 ADB. 2008. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Program Loan \nand Technical Assistance to the Republic of Indonesia for the Second Local Government Finance and Governance \nReform Program Cluster. Manila. \n21 Government regulation 38/2007 on the Division of Responsibilities among the central, provincial, district, and \nmunicipal governments comprises the implementing rules and regulations for Law 32/2004 on regional autonomy. \nIt is a comprehensive document of almost 900 pages that allocates the responsibilities in 32 sectors, such as \ninfrastructure, education, health, and forestry, to the different levels of government. \n ", " 19\npractices and arrangements have been reviewed, and policy recommendations developed in \nclose collaboration with the concerned line ministries and agencies. The approach would be to \nundertake  the  following  steps  for  each  PSO  proposal:  (i)  identification  of  the  rationale  for \nsubsidization, (ii) determination of target beneficiaries, (iii) determination of PSO objectives and \noutcomes, (iv) estimation of the PSO cost, (v) selection of the most suitable delivery mechanism \nsuch as lifeline rates or direct cash subsidy, (vi) development of a monitoring and evaluation \nsystem, and (vii) description of contractual and payment arrangements. \n \n58.    The new PSO policy will be issued and implemented under subprogram 3. Mirroring the \ncross-sector  approach  to  PPP  projects  through  presidential  regulation  67/2005,  a  PSO \nregulation will be issued by BAPPENAS. The regulation will provide for the establishment of a \ncentral PSO unit under the KKPPI secretariat to assist the line ministries and agencies in \npreparing the standardized PSO proposals, which will be screened and prioritized by KKPPI \nbefore their submission to Parliament.  \n \n59.    Sector Regulation. This is another important cross-cutting area where the current \npractices  and  arrangements  differ  widely  from  sector  to  sector  (para.  17).  Nevertheless, \nprogress  has  been  made  towards  a  better  regulatory  framework.  Prior  to  and  during \nsubprogram 1, the Government established new, though not yet fully independent, regulatory \nbodies for toll roads, the downstream part of the oil and gas sector, telecommunications, and \nwater supply and sanitation. Under subprogram 2, these bodies have become operational in \nterms of budget, staffing, functions, and standard operating procedures. In addition, a similar \ncollaborative approach supported by TA (footnote 9) as used to develop the PSO policy has \nbeen adopted to review the current practices and arrangements in all infrastructure sectors, and \nto formulate short- and medium-term recommendations for strengthening sector regulation. The \nkey recommendation is to aim at having in each sector an independent regulator with the \nfollowing  economic  functions:  (i)  setting  (approving)  tariffs  and  other  service  charges,  (ii) \nestablishing  standards for  the  terms  and  conditions  of providing  services,  (iii)  making  and \nenforcing market rules for the sector, (iv) monitoring economic and management performance of \nthe regulated entities, (v) issuing, reviewing, and canceling licenses, (vi) reviewing concession \nagreements, and (vii) arbitrating disputes within the sector. \n \n60.  The development of such independent regulators will require time, legislative changes \nthat  may  not  be  possible  in  some  sectors,22  and,  most  importantly,  willingness  by  the \nGovernment to give up its control of tariffs. As such, it is unlikely to occur within the remaining \nIRSDP  time  frame.  However,  various  short-term  recommendations  to  move  towards  the \nintroduction  of  internationally  recognized  regulatory  practices  can  be  implemented  under \nsubprogram 3. These include consolidating the existing regulatory functions under each line \nministry,  building  the  line  ministries'  capacity  in  regulatory  procedures,  creating  a  more \ntransparent regulatory environment, encouraging stakeholder participation in regulatory matters, \nand allowing tariffs to reach cost recovery levels. During this transition period, regulation by \ncontract will play an important role for PPP projects.   \n \n3.  Sector Policy, Legal, and Institutional Reforms \n61.    Roads. Road law 38/2004 and the subsequent Government regulation 15/2005 on Toll \nRoads unbundled the sector by (i) ending the monopoly of the main SOE, Jasa Marga, in toll \nroad  development,  (ii)  allowing  private  investors  to  bid  for  new  toll  road  concessions  in \ncompetition with Jasa Marga, (iii) separating the regulatory functions from Jasa Marga, and (iv) \nestablishing a new regulatory and contracting body, the Indonesian Toll Road Authority (BPJT). \n                                                 \n 22 After the annulment of law 20/2002 on Electricity by the Constitutional Court, and given the political sensitivity of \nelectricity tariffs, delegating their control to an independent regulator will be difficult. By contrast, the new law \n17/2008 on shipping does provide for the establishment of regional port authorities with a regulatory function.  \n   ", "20    \nDecree 374/2005 of MPW stipulated that the toll road tariffs should be set on the basis of a \ntendering process. At the same time, tariffs for existing toll roads were increased by 15%\u201350% \nto ensure financial sustainability of toll road operation. Under subprogram 2, the legal framework \nhas  been  completed  by  eight  MPW  regulations  related  to  various  aspects  of  toll  road \npreparation,  development,  and  operation.  Under  subprogram  3,  road  law  38/2004  will  be \ncomplemented by the new Law on Road Traffic and Transportation, already drafted by MOT \nand  submitted  to  Parliament,  which  provides  opportunities  for  PSP  in  transport  services, \ntransport infrastructure such as bus terminals and parking, and support services such as vehicle \ninspection. \n \n62.  BPJT, which reports to the minister of Public Works, has become fully operational. Its \nresponsibilities include developing business plans and feasibility studies for toll road projects, \nfacilitating land acquisition, recommending toll fees, and conduct tendering and supervise the \nimplementation of toll road concessions. Several options for enhancing BPJT\u2019s independence \nare under study, one of them being the conversion to a public service agency that would need \napproval by Parliament. \n \n63.    BPJT has been active in implementing the Government\u2019s toll road program. Selection of \nprivate sector sponsors has been undertaken for several batches totaling 28 projects, and \nconcession agreements have been signed for 22 of them. However, because of inadequate \nproject  preparation  and  uncertainties  about  land  acquisition  and  Government  support, \ncompetition has been generally weak and the project sponsors have had difficulties in achieving \nfinancial closure. Two measures have been taken to overcome these problems. A revolving \nfund for land acquisition has been established by MOF and MPW through the creation of a \npublic service agency for this purpose, and initial capital of Rp1.44 trillion has been allocated to \nit in the 2008 budget. Second, the land-capping principle has been introduced for the 28 \nprojects, with the toll road companies bearing the additional cost of land acquisition up to 10% \nof the value stipulated in their concession agreements and the Government contributing the \nrest.  The  total  amount  of  Government  support  of  Rp.4.9  trillion  for  these  projects  will  be \nallocated under the amendment to the 2008 budget, and in the 2009 and 2010 budgets. For any \nnew toll road projects, the land acquisition process will have to be completed before bids are \ncalled for. \n \n64.  To increase transparency and reduce opportunities for corruption, MPW\u2019s Directorate \nGeneral of Highways (DGH) has adopted standard bidding documents and developed an e-\nprocurement  system  for  all  road  contracts.  Under  subprogram  2,  the  system  has  been \nimplemented in the headquarters. It will be expanded nationally during the subprogram 3 period. \nIn addition, a comprehensive action program of other anticorruption measures in the areas of \nprocurement, monitoring and evaluation, community participation, internal and external auditing, \nand human resource development, has been formulated and is being implemented. \n \n65.  Under subprogram 2, DGH has given priority in its budget to routine maintenance, \nincreasing the allocation from Rp1.48 trillion in 2006 to Rp2.49 trillion in 2007 and Rp2.77 trillion \nin 2008. To put the financing of road maintenance on a self-sustaining basis, it will be necessary \nto  restructure  the  current  vehicle-related  taxes  into  a  system  of  road  user  charges  which \nensures full recovery of the necessary road preservation costs and reflects actual road usage \nand the contribution of various vehicle categories to these costs. In particular, charges for heavy \nvehicles should be related to their load capacity and road-damaging effects. Under subprogram \n2, the establishment of a suitable mechanism in the form of the road fund has been studied with \nTA support (footnote 9). As such a fund can operate only after all fuel subsidies have been \nremoved, recommendations have been made for the interim period. Finally, to increase PSP in \nthis area, with assistance from the World Bank and AusAID, DGH is developing a program of \nperformance-based contracting for road maintenance and vehicle load control. \n ", " 21\n66.    Ports and Airports. The legal framework is being revised to end the monopolies of the \nfour SOEs in the port sector and two SOEs in the airport sector, as well as their multiple roles of \nlandlord, regulator, contracting authority for the provision of port and airport services, and \noperator.  The  revision  started  under  subprogram  1  with  presidential  instruction  5/2005  on \nEmpowering  Domestic  Shipping  Industry,  which  encouraged  competition  among  operators \nwithin and between ports. Under subprogram 2, law 17/2008 on shipping, which aims to make \nport operations more efficient and reduce the high transportation costs, has been passed by \nParliament. It reflects decentralization, removes the monopoly within a transition period of 3 \nyears after which SOEs will transfer their assets to the Government and play only the role of \noperators, and allows PSP without having to form a joint venture with SOEs. The new law also \ncalls  for  the  establishment,  on  a  regional  basis  under  MOT,  of  port  authorities  to  act  as \nregulators and contracting agencies. Under subprogram 3, eight government regulations will be \nissued to guide implementation of the new law. Similar liberalization is expected in the airport \nbusiness and airline industry with the new law on aviation. Apart from ending the SOE monopoly \nand establishing a new regulator, the draft law envisages the creation of a separate provider of \nair traffic control services. \n \n67.    In  both  sectors,  MOT  regulations have  been  issued  during  subprogram  2  on  tariff \nformulation  and  application  for  port  and  airport  services,  distinguishing  between  ports  and \nairports operated by the SOEs and those under the responsibility of MOT. Similar regulations \nhave been issued for economy-class airfares and shipping tariffs.  \n \n68.  Railways. An important subprogram 2 milestone has been the passage by Parliament \nof law 23/2007 on railway, which has removed the monopoly of the SOE\u2014the Indonesian \nRailway Corporation (KAI)\u2014and established the framework for PSP both in the development of \nbasic infrastructure and operation of rolling stock. MOT has drafted four government regulations \nfor the new law that elaborate on, among other things, the role of central and local governments \nand the selection of private sector partners. Another subprogram 2 output has been the railway \nrevitalization program for 2008\u20132010 that covers Java and North Sumatra, where about 4,000 \nkilometers of railways are still in operation. In addition, the railway transportation master plan, \nfocusing on short-term investments and operation and maintenance, has been updated with \nJICA\u2019s assistance. To implement the revitalization program, the Government has allocated \nRp19 trillion ($2.1 billion) to KAI for a planned joint venture with private companies to transport \ncement,  coal,  and  shipping  containers  in  Sumatra,  and  as  the  start-up  capital  for  a  new \nsubsidiary  which  will  double  the  capacity  of  the  commuter  rail  service  in  Jakarta  and  its \nenvirons.  \n \n69.  Passenger fares for economy-class travel are set periodically by MOT, putting more \nemphasis on ability to pay than cost recovery. Other passenger fares and all freight fares can be \nset by KAI subject to MOT\u2019s endorsement. Under subprogram 3, an MOT regulation on the \nformula for tariff calculation aimed at full cost recovery, taking into account PSO subsidy, will be \nissued. Such transparent tariff and PSO arrangements are necessary to encourage PSP. JICA \nis assisting KAI in improving railway operation and maintenance so that it will be able to meet \nthe challenge of competition with private service providers. \n \n70.  Oil and Gas. The Government has given high priority to, and showed remarkable \npolitical courage in, reducing fuel subsidies that have imposed a heavy burden on the budget, \ndisproportionately benefited the middle class and the rich, and distorted the energy mix. In 2005 \nunder subprogram 1, the domestic prices of oil products except kerosene were first increased \nby an average of 49%. This was followed by bringing the prices for industrial users, accounting \nfor 37% of total consumption, to international levels and, after intensive socialization efforts, \nraising prices of the remaining oil products by an additional 126%. To mitigate the social impact \nof these unprecedented measures, the Government announced a major package of direct \n   ", "22    \nsubsidies to the poor. The Government also made clear its intention to complete the fuel \nsubsidy removal in the next few years and let domestic oil prices follow international prices \nthereafter. However, the sharp price increases led to a temporary slowdown in economic growth \nand an upsurge in inflation. For macroeconomic and political reasons, the Government decided \nto defer further price adjustments until after the next elections in 2009. The recent escalation of \ninternational oil prices made a reconsideration of this decision unavoidable. In May 2008, \ndomestic oil prices were increased by an average of 29%.23 The price increases have been \ncomplemented by several measures to influence consumer behavior and stop diversion of the \nstill highly subsidized kerosene to other uses: (i) issuance of control cards to households limiting \ntheir monthly kerosene consumption, (ii) conversion from kerosene to liquefied petroleum gas, \nwith free distribution of gas stoves and cylinders to households,24 and (iii) smart cards for \ngasoline limiting the quantity purchased per vehicle at the subsidized price.  \n \n71.  Given the country's large reserves, natural gas can play a much more important role \ndomestically. Presidential regulation 5/2006 on National Energy Policy calls for a minimum \nshare of 30% for natural gas in Indonesia\u2019s energy mix by 2025, compared to less than 20% for \noil. To move towards this target, an oil and gas sector blueprint has been prepared and a \nmaster plan for the natural gas pipeline network already completed under subprogram 2. In \nresponse to the Constitutional Court\u2019s ruling on Oil and Gas Law 22/2001, the Ministry of \nEnergy and Mineral Resources (MEMR) has drafted two regulations, which set the domestic \nmarket obligation for gas producers at 25% and outline pricing principles. Another impetus to \nthe domestic use of gas has come from the new law 30/2007 on Energy and the related \nGovernment regulations on energy conservation, renewable energy, and supply and utilization \nof energy, all of which promote greater PSP. As investments in the country\u2019s large reserves of \ncoal-bed methane have been limited due to lack of policy and legal clarity, guidelines for the \nexploration  and  production  of  this  resource  have  been  issued  through  MEMR  regulation \n33/2006. BPH Migas, established as a regulatory body for downstream oil and gas activities and \na contracting agency for transmission and distribution of natural gas, is fully operational with \nabout 70 permanent and 30 contractual staff. Its main objectives are to ensure supply security \nof oil products and increase domestic utilization of natural gas.  \n \n72.  Power. The annulment by the Constitutional Court of law 20/2002 on Electricity, which \nprovided  a  progressive  long-term  vision  in  terms  of  unbundling,  independent  regulation, \ncompetition, and PSP, was a serious setback for power sector reforms. To remove the legal \nuncertainty caused by this ruling that automatically led to reenactment of the previous law \n15/1985 on Electricity, Government regulations 3/2005 and 26/2006 were issued as an interim \nsolution until a new law was in place. While giving the principal authority for power supply to \nPLN, the regulations allow purchase of electricity by PLN from independent power producers \n(IPPs). Under subprogram 2, a new electricity law has been drafted by MEMR and submitted to \nParliament, where it has been undergoing extensive deliberations and stakeholder consultations \nto reach a consensus on how to reduce PLN\u2019s monopoly and increase competition, while \nretaining control of the sector through stronger planning and regulation. The draft law allows \ncompetition  only  in  power  generation  but  it  provides  for  more  than  one  utility,  so  that \nregionalization of power supply is possible. In anticipation of this change, the Ministry of State-\nOwned Enterprises has prepared a policy paper on PLN\u2019s restructuring that envisages the \ncreation of regional subsidiaries and the conversion of PLN from an operator to an investment \nholding company. The first step in implementing the paper\u2019s recommendation has been taken \nby restructuring PLN\u2019s board of directors in March 2008 and tasking it with the establishment of \n                                                 \n23 From Rp4,500/liter (l) to Rp6,000/l for gasoline (by 33%), from Rp4,300/l to Rp5,500/l for automotive diesel oil (by \n28%), and from Rp2,000/l to Rp2,500/l for kerosene (by 25%). Despite these significant increases, the allocation \nfor fuel subsidies in the revised national budget amounts to Rp127 trillion ($13.9 billion), or about 12% of total \nspending (based on an assumed average price of $95/barrel throughout 2008). \n24 As of 30 June 2008, free gas stoves had been distributed to 9.3 million low-income families and businesses. \n ", " 23\nsubsidiaries in Java-Bali in 2009, Sumatra in 2009, and East Indonesia thereafter. The Java-Bali \nsubsidiary will be responsible only for power transmission and distribution, as there are already \ntwo generation subsidiaries in that region. \n \n73.  PLN has an installed capacity of about 24,000 megawatts (MW), but with demand \ngrowing at almost 10% per year, its reserve margin has decreased to 20% from the safe level of \n30%. This decrease, combined with derating of older power plants and problems with natural \ngas supply, has recently led to widespread load shedding. PLN\u2019s 10-year power development \nplan, updated under subprogram 2, is anchored on a fast-track public sector program of 10,000 \nMW of coal-fired plants and an IPP program of another 10,000 MW using coal, geothermal \nenergy, and renewable energy resources. Both programs are under way, but it will take several \nyears to remove the capacity constraints and displace oil-based generation. Under subprogram \n3, with support from the World Bank PLN will formulate and start to implement a new rural \nelectrification strategy to meet the Government\u2019s target of 90% access by 2020.   \n \n74.  Unlike domestic oil prices, there has been no uniform increase in electricity tariffs since \n2003, when the average tariff was brought to the pre-crisis level of $0.068 per kilowatt-hour \n(kWh), with only the first 30 kWh of the monthly consumption of small consumers subsidized \nthrough a lifeline rate of $0.018/kWh. Because of the escalating oil prices and significant share \nof oil-fired power plants in PLN\u2019s generation mix, the fuel cost alone now exceeds the average \ntariff,  and  all  consumer  categories  are  subsidized.  The  total  electricity  subsidy  in  2008  is \nestimated at Rp60 trillion ($6.5 billion). PLN is having ongoing discussions with large industries \nto seek increased payments in return for more reliable power supply. In April 2008, the so-called \ndisincentive scheme, with unsubsidized tariffs for consumption above a certain threshold, has \nbeen introduced for large residential customers, but the Government is reluctant to go beyond \nthat and compound the effects of the domestic oil price increases with major across-the-board \nelectricity tariff adjustments. Nevertheless, the Government recognizes that restoring PLN\u2019s \nfinancial viability in the medium term is crucial to enhancing its creditworthiness and avoiding \nrequests by IPPs and their lenders for government guarantees against this off-take risk. In the \ninterim, the Government has been providing assurances for new IPP projects by referring to its \nPSO policy for SOEs and MOF\u2019s regulations on PLN subsidy.   \n \n75.  Telecommunications. This infrastructure sector is more advanced in terms of reforms \nthan the others and is naturally progressing, without much external intervention, towards ever \ngreater PSP. As in other countries, this is attributable to the technological advances driving the \nsector,  as  well  as  to  the  fact  that  its  tariffs  are  less  affected  by  political  and  social \nconsiderations. The two major enterprises\u2014Telkom and Indosat\u2014are listed on the Jakarta and \nNew  York  stock  exchanges,  the  Indonesian  Telecommunications  Regulatory  Body  (BRTI) \nestablished under the Ministry of Communications and Informatics is fully operational, and \nregulation 8/2006 on interconnection has allowed a move from revenue sharing to a cost-based \napproach for tariff setting.  \n \n76.  Under subprogram 2, the scope of the sector blueprint has been broadened to reflect \nthe convergence of information and communications technology (ICT). The blueprint, named the \nICT Infrastructure Convergence Road Map, aims at creating a more competitive market for the \nentire spectrum of these services (voice, data, and broadcasting), and will be implemented \nduring  2009\u20132014.  As  part  of  the  move  from  the  Telkom  and  Indosat  duopoly  to  more \ncompetition, a third provider of international connections\u2014Bakrie Telekom\u2014has been selected \nin  a  \u201cbeauty  contest\u201d25  of  four  domestic  candidates,  based  on  their  subscriber  base,  and \ninternational  and  domestic  links.  A  similar  contest  is  under  preparation  for  long-distance \n                                                 \n25 This term is used for a technical, administrative, and financial evaluation of operators that is allowed by law \n36/1999 on telecommunications and the related Government regulation 52/2000. \n   ", "24    \ndomestic  connections.  Ministerial  regulation  9/2006  has  provided  formulas  to  be  used  by \noperators to set their basic tariffs for fixed lines, and ministerial regulation 9/2008 does the same \nfor cellular phones, with BRTI having the right to intervene in the case of noncompetitive \nconduct. In April 2008, BRTI cut cellular interconnection tariffs by 20%\u201340%. Finally, a universal \nservice obligation policy has been formulated to accelerate the expansion of services in rural \nareas.26  Government  regulation  28/2005  allows  the  retention  of  0.75%  of  revenues  of \ntelecommunication companies for this purpose. Tendering open to all operators in Indonesia \nhas been conducted for performance-based contracts for 11 geographical blocks, with the \nrequired monthly subsidy as the main bid parameter.  \n \n77.  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation.  The  IRSDP  has  supported  the  formulation  and \nimplementation of policies on community and institution-based provision of water supply and \nsanitation services to more effectively address access and quality issues in service delivery. \nThe  Water  Resources  Law  7/2004  and  Government  regulation  16/2005  on  Water  Supply \nestablished the legal framework for PSP by clarifying its forms,27 ending PDAM monopolies, \neliminating the need for local parliament approval of water tariff increases, and calling for the \nestablishment  of  the  National  Water  Supply  System  Development  Supporting  Agency \n(BPPSPAM)  under  MPW.  During  subprogram  2,  MPW  regulation  20/2006  on  policy  and \nstrategy for water supply development has been issued that aims at increasing the current \nconnection ratios of about 42% in urban areas and 9% in rural areas to meet the Millennium \nDevelopment Goal target of halving by 2015 the proportion of people without sustainable access \nto safe drinking water. The two-pronged strategy relies on PDAMs and private concessionaires \nfor expanding water supply and sanitation in urban areas and a community-driven development \napproach in rural villages. The latter is supported by the Government\u2019s Self-Help Program for \nCommunity Empowerment (PNPM Mandiri) that provides grants for small facilities in all villages \nin Indonesia during 2007\u20132012.28 The legal framework has been completed through MPW \nregulations on water supply provision (with detailed guidelines for PDAMs and private sector \noperators) and solid-waste management, as well as by passing law 18/2008 on Municipal \nWaste Management that promotes the \"3Rs\" principle (reduce, reuse, and recycle).  \n \n78.  BPPSPAM is an advisory body whose responsibilities include helping formulate sector \npolicy  and  strategy,  setting  operational  standards  for  water  supply,  setting  and  evaluating \nservice  standards  and  performance  of  PDAMs,  making  recommendations  on  involving \ncooperatives and the private sector in water supply, and settling disputes. Under subprogram 2, \nBPPSPAM has completed the mapping of managerial, technical, and financial performance for \n306 out of 335 PDAMs,29 and published the results in a book and on its website. Using criteria \nsuch as operating ratio, debt\u2013equity ratio, customer structure, number of employees per 1,000 \ncustomers, water losses, and operating hours, the PDAMs have been classified into three \ncategories: (i) healthy PDAMs (79, or 26%), (ii) less healthy PDAMs (114, or 37%), and (iii) sick \nPDAMs (113, or 37%). The mapping will be updated every year to exert pressure on PDAMs to \nimprove their performance through enhanced managerial autonomy, technical capacity building, \ncost recovery tariffs, improved revenue collection, better financial management and accounting, \nunaccounted-for water reduction, stronger customer orientation, and mergers of small nonviable \nPDAMs. \n \n79.  An important prerequisite for improving performance of PDAMs so that they can expand \nservice coverage is debt resolution. MOF regulation 107/2005 allowed restructuring of PDAM \ndebt totaling Rp6.7 trillion, but progress was very slow. A more radical restructuring program \n                                                 \n26 In the telecommunications sector, PSO is generally referred to as universal service obligation. \n27  PSP can take the form of a cooperation agreement with the PDAM concerned or a license granted by the local \ngovernment concerned. \n28 PNPM Mandiri is cofinanced by ADB, JICA, and World Bank. \n29 The remaining PDAMs do not have financial statements yet. \n ", " 25\nhas therefore been designed with the following main features: (i) debt principal must be repaid, \nbut the repayment can be rescheduled, (ii) interest and penalties can be fully written off for the \nless healthy and sick PDAMs, and partly written off and partly swapped into investment by the \nhealthy ones, (iii) to participate in the program, PDAMs must submit to MOF by December 2008 \na  request,  supported  by  an  audited  financial  report  with  no  qualifications,  an  audited \nperformance report, previous year budget, 5-year business plan, and a joint letter from the \nmayor and head of local parliament that the PDAM will honor its debt obligations, and (iv) the \nPDAM\u2019s tariffs must be higher than the production costs plus overheads. This program has \nbeen formally launched by MOF regulation 120/2008 on PDAM Debt Restructuring. \n \n80.  With regard to tariffs, after the removal of the requirement for local parliament approval \nof any increases, regulation 23/2006 on drinking water tariff policy was issued by the Ministry of \nHome Affairs. It introduced the principle of cost recovery and reduced the number of customer \ncategories. Most PDAMs in the healthy category have benefited from tariff increases. Based on \nBPPSPAM\u2019s ranking, MPW has sent a letter to about 50 large PDAMs in the lower categories to \nadjust their tariffs to the cost-recovery level of Rp3,500 per cubic meter.  \n \n4.  Public\u2013Private Partnership Projects \n81.  The  best  test  of  the  new  policy,  legal,  regulatory,  and  institutional  framework  is \nsuccessful implementation of PPP projects that would signal Indonesia\u2019s readiness for private \ninvestment  and  its  ability  to  follow  international  practices  in  terms  of  transparency  and \ncompetition. That is the reason why the policy matrix also includes actions directly related to \nsuch projects.  \n \n82.  At the IIS in January 2005, the Government offered 91 projects totaling $22.5 billion to \nthe private sector, but the response was mostly weak, and in those cases where concession \nagreements were signed, the project sponsors have had difficulties in arranging financing. With \nthe establishment of PSP and risk-management frameworks and strengthening of KKPPI, the \nexecution of PPP projects was expected to accelerate. Under subprogram 1, the Government \nidentified 10 candidates for model PPP projects with combined investment requirements of $4.5 \nbillion that would go through all the necessary preparatory steps and transparent tendering \nprocesses stipulated in the new frameworks (Table 3).  \n \nTable 3: Model Public\u2013Private Partnership Projects  \n    Investment    \nProject  Key Feature  ($ million)  Current Status \nCentral Java Coal-Fired Power Plant   1,200 MW  1,200  FS ongoing \nPasuruan Combined Cycle Plant  600 MW  275  Gas supply assessment \ncompleted \nMedan\u2013Kuala Namu Toll Road   22 km  142  FS revised and updated \nSolo\u2013Kertosono Toll Road   165 km  928  Tendering completed \nMargagiri\u2013Ketapang Ferry Terminal  0.9 million vehicles and  97  Recruitment of FS consultants \n1.2 million passengers p.a.  under way \nTeluk Lamong Seaport  1.9 million containers p.a.  275  FS completed; project \ndeferred \nKabupaten Bandung Water Supply   450 l/second  26  FS completed.  \nKabupaten Dumai Water Supply  500 l/second  44  Project postponed \nKabupaten Tangerang Water Supply  550 l/second  37  Tendering completed; \nconcession agreement signed  \nPalapa Ring Telecommunications  30,000 km of fiber optic  1,500  Tendering completed \nProject  cable \nFS = feasibility study, l = liter, km = kilometer, MW = megawatt, p.a. = per annum. \nSource: KKPPI (National Committee for the Acceleration of Infrastructure Provision) secretariat. \n \n83.  While significant progress has been made in implementing policy reforms, the progress \non the model projects during subprogram 2 has been uneven. As shown in Table 3, feasibility \n   ", "26    \nstudies have been completed or are ongoing for 7 out of the 10 model projects, and will start \nsoon for another one. Tendering has been completed for only three projects and the slow \nprogress has been attributable to (i) the lack of familiarity of line ministries, their agencies, and \nlocal governments with the PPP modality and requirements of presidential regulation 67/2005, \n(ii)  a  tendency  to  underestimate  the  importance  of  project  preparation  through  bankable \nfeasibility studies and proper structuring, (iii) the preference of SOEs for the traditional business-\nto-business approach of direct negotiations, and (iv) original schedules that were too ambitious, \ngiven the complexity of PPP projects. The last factor has been aggravated by a rather long time \ntaken to recruit consultants, as Government  procurement committees are very  cautious in \nfollowing the due process for evaluation of proposals and contract negotiations so as to avoid \nallegations of corruption.  \n \n84.  Three model projects have been deferred or dropped. Based on the feasibility study for \nthe Teluk Lamong seaport, the project has been deferred to fully utilize the existing container \nfacilities in the nearby Tanjung Perak port. The study for the Kabupaten Bandung water supply \nhas shown that the project is not financially feasible as a PPP. The Kota Dumai water supply \nproject has been postponed for the time being because of problems with raw water supply. \nHowever, these setbacks have been more than made up for by BAPPENAS\u2019s efforts to socialize \nthe PSP framework and PPP modality through meetings and workshops, both nationally and \nregionally. These efforts, which will continue with PDF support under subprogram 3, have \nresulted in the current pipeline of 21 active projects\u20147 model and 14 others\u2014that are listed in \nAppendix 7.30  \n \n85.  The  Government  has  requested  that  the  IRSDP  and  IDPL  policy  matrixes  be \nharmonized in terms of project-related triggers. The IDPL was designed 2 years after the \nIRSDP, when the various obstacles to, and delays in, the model PPP projects were becoming \nevident. Learning from this experience and further assessing the complexity of the enabling \nenvironment  for  PSP  both  in  Indonesia  and  other  countries,  the  Government  and  its \ndevelopment partners have concluded that progress on greater sustainable PSP will require \nmore thorough project preparation and flexibility in project selection than previously anticipated. \nWhile completion of prefeasibility and feasibility studies and tendering for all 10 model PPP \nprojects were originally envisaged under subprogram 2 of the IRSDP, the IDPL 2 triggers call for \nthe initiation of feasibility studies for 10 PPP projects, and of tendering for two of them, without \ndistinguishing between the model and other projects but in full compliance with the presidential \nregulation 67/2005 requirements. Under IDPL 4, financial closure is to be achieved in 2010 for \ntwo PPP projects. These more realistic targets have been incorporated in the policy matrix \nattached to the Government\u2019s letter of development policy in Appendix 6. In terms of feasibility \nstudies, the target has been exceeded by completing such studies for 10 projects and starting \nthem for another two. A tendering process fully consistent with presidential regulation 67/2005 \nhas started for 4 toll roads and for the Central Java coal-fired power plant, which is the most \nprominent among the model PPP projects, will commence early 2009.31  \n   \nE.  Summary of Implementation Progress  \n86.  In its original form in 2006, the IRSDP policy matrix consisted of 69 actions with a total \nof 215 specific outputs (subprogram 1 had 63 outputs, subprogram 2 had 99 outputs and \nsubprogram 3 had 53 outputs). The imbalance between subprogram 2 and subprogram 3 was \n                                                 \n30 In addition to the projects in Appendix 7 that follow presidential regulation 67/2005, there is a large number of PPP \ntransactions  dating  back  to  the  pre-IRSDP  period,  a  significant  portion  of  which  were  directly  negotiated. \nConstruction has begun on over $2 billion of these projects, including power plants, toll roads, and water treatment \nplants. A few short sections of toll roads and small bulk water treatment plants totaling almost $90 million have \nalready begun operation. \n31 The feasibility study for this project is approaching completion by the International Finance Corporation, which is \nalso providing advisory services for the transaction execution. \n ", " 27\nrecognized in paras. 31 and 69 of the previous report and recommendation of the president \n(footnote 13), which indicated that this would be monitored and adjusted as necessary during \nimplementation of subprogram 2 and subprogram 3. During the review missions in May\u2013June \n2007 and April 2008,32 and the appraisal mission in September 2008, the policy matrix was \nrevised based on discussions with the various government ministries and agencies. In addition, \nthe subprogram 2 period was extended by 3 months up to the end of September 2008 to \nsynchronize the IRSDP with IDPL 2, and a similar extension was made for subprogram 3. The \nrevised policy matrix is given in Appendix 6 and summarized in Table 4.  \n \n87.  The IRSDP design has proved to be quite resilient, and appropriate for the type of \nreforms pursued. Without affecting the overall thrust of the IRSDP, 11 outputs were dropped \nbecause they have either been de-linked from the IRSDP or are covered by other outputs \n(Appendix 8). At the same time, 10 new outputs were added, taking into account changing \ncircumstances.33 The project-related outputs were aligned with the IDPL triggers (para. 85),34 \nand the description of several other outputs was modified to better reflect their actual nature. \nConsidering changing priorities, some outputs were deferred from SP2 to SP3, and others \nadvanced from SP3 to SP2. The majority of the deferred outputs are likely to be completed \nbefore  mid-2009,  such  as  the  drafting  of  the  laws  on  road  traffic  and  transportation  and \nelectricity, which were completed quite some time ago, but intergovernmental discussions are \ntaking longer than expected. Regarding PPP projects, positive results are already beginning to \nshow, with three of the model projects already tendered to be followed by tendering for at least \n4 new toll roads and the 1,200 MW coal-fired plant in Central Java. \n \nTable 4: Summary of the Revised Policy Matrix \n    Outputs \n    Sub- Sub- Sub-  \nSector  Actions  program 1  program 2  program 3  Total \n(Jan 05\u2013   (Oct 06\u2013   (Oct 08\u2013  Outputs \nSep 06)  Sep 08)  Sep 10) \nCross-Sector  8  21  13  11  45 \nLand Transportation  6  3  6  7  16 \nRailways  6  0  5  10  15 \nSea Transportation  6  5  5  4  14 \nAir Transportation  7  4  5  4  13 \nRoads  7  10  8  7  25 \nPower  8  3  6  11  20 \nOil and Gas  5  6  5  4  15 \nTelecommunications  5  3  3  4  10 \nWater Supply and Sanitation  8  5  11  10  26 \nProject Transactions  4  3  7  5  15 \nTotal  70  63  74  77  214 \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n 88.  Table 4 shows that (i) with 74 completed outputs, the reform momentum has been \nmaintained during subprogram 2, (ii) significant progress has been made both in cross-sector \nand sector-specific reforms, and (iii) none of the sectors is lagging behind. The following policy- \nand project-related outputs completed under subprogram 2 are particularly noteworthy: \n                                                 \n32 In view of the satisfactory reform progress, the second review mission was converted into fact-finding for \nsubprogram 2. \n33 Outputs 1.5, 1.7, 3.6, 3.8, 4.5, 52.2, 58.2, 59.5, 62.4, and 62.5 in Appendix 6. \n34 Outputs 69.3, 70.1, and 70.3 in Appendix 6. \n   ", "28    \n(i)  revision of presidential regulation 67/2005 submitted for ministerial approval; \n(ii)  strengthening of the KKPPI secretariat; \n(iii)  the RMU becoming operational; \n(iv)  the PDF becoming operational; \n(v)  the anticorruption action plan of DGH; \n(vi)  demarcation of infrastructure provision among central and local governments; \n(vii)  review of institutional arrangements for sector regulation; \n(viii)  the railway law; \n(ix)  the shipping law; \n(x)  the energy law; \n(xi)  the municipal waste-management law; \n(xii)  the revolving fund for land acquisition; \n(xiii)  tariff setting in the transportation, telecommunications, and water supply sectors; \n(xiv)  partial removal of fuel subsidies; \n(xv)  the community-based water supply program; \n(xvi)  the PDAM debt restructuring program; \n(xvii)  feasibility studies for 12 PPP projects; and \n(xviii)  tendering for three PPP projects completed; initiated for 4 new toll roads \n   \nV.  THE PROPOSED LOAN FOR SUBPROGRAM 2 \nA.  Financing Plan \n89.  The IRSDP adopts a program cluster approach with three back-to-back subprograms, \neach covering about 2 years and supported by a single-tranche program loan. Thus, subject to \napproval of subprogram 2 by the Board in November 2008, subprogram 3 could be brought for \nthe Board\u2019s consideration in the second half of 2010. The Government continues to strongly \nsupport the program cluster approach, as it provides much greater flexibility and facilitates \nmedium-term planning. This flexibility, and the fact that the processing of subprogram 2 and \nsubprogram 3 is effectively embedded into the loan review process, reduces the transaction \ncosts  both  for  the  Government  and  ADB  by  avoiding  rigid  policy  conditions  built  into \nmultitranche programs. These conditions have frequently led to delays in the past because of \npolitical economy factors beyond the Government\u2019s control. \n  \n90.  Subprogram 2 is a continuation of subprogram 1, and its policy content in terms of \nactions and outputs is comparable. A loan of $280 million is proposed, compared with the CSP \nallocation of $200 million. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years; \nan interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum; conversion options that may \nbe exercised in accordance with the draft loan agreement, the loan regulations, and ADB\u2019s \nconversion guidelines; and such other terms and conditions as set forth in the draft program \nloan agreement. The Government has given ADB (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under \nADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  and  (ii)  an  undertaking  that  this  choice  was  its  own \nindependent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n91.  The loan size complements the strength of the policy package, its development impact, \nthe importance of the sectors covered, and the Government\u2019s overall financing needs. Table 5 \nshows  budget  allocations  in  2008  and  2009  for  IRSDP-related  costs  totaling  about  \nRp17.4 trillion, or $1.9 billion. This does not include PSO subsidies, which consist of the annual \nPLN subsidy of Rp60 trillion ($6.5 billion) plus about Rp2 trillion ($0.2 billion) for sectors other \nthan power. A significant part of the PLN subsidy and all of the subsidies to the sectors other \nthan  power  are  directed  at  increasing  access  to  infrastructure  services  and  making  them \naffordable for the poor.  \n ", " 29\nTable 5: Budget Allocation for Government Obligations \n(Rp billion) \n \nItem  2008 2009 \nGovernment Investment Centera  1,050 1,000 \nIndonesia Infrastructure Fund  1,000 0 \nQatar Investment Fund  1,500 0 \nLand Acquisition Fund  1,444 2,800 \nLand Capping  745 2,000 \nPLN Guarantees  300 1,000 \nSOE Restructuring Guarantees  1,500 1,000 \nPDAM Debt Restructuring  0 2,100 \n        Total  7,539 9,900 \nPDAM = regional water supply enterprise, PLN = State Electricity Corporation, SOE =  \nstate-owned enterprise.        \na A supervisory, regulatory, and operational body created under the Directorate General  \nof Treasury to oversee government investment, mainly for infrastructure. \n  Source: Ministry of Finance. \n \n92.    The World Bank is considering the same loan amount for its IDPL 2 as for IDPL 1, \nnamely,  $200  million.35  The  Government  of  Japan  plans  to  cofinance  subprogram  2  with  \n$100 million, as it did for subprogram 1. In terms of its overall financing requirements in 2008, \nthe Government has sought about $2.8 billion in program loans from its three main development \npartners. This reflects a projected fiscal deficit of 1.8% of GDP in 2008 (compared with 1.2% in \n2007), which is close to the 1.7% deficit in the original budget, but lower than the 2.1% deficit in \nthe revised budget. The program lending support will assist the Government in meeting the \nreform-related costs as well as its overall financing requirements. \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Program Management \n93.  BAPPENAS  remains  the  Executing  Agency  responsible  for  coordinating  the \nimplementation of the IRSDP. KKPPI, chaired by the coordinating minister for economic affairs, \noversees  the  implementation  and provides  guidance  and  direction  to  the  line ministries in \ncharge  of  the  various  infrastructure  sectors,  which  acts  as  the  Implementing  Agencies. \nImplementation of the policy actions are being coordinated with other agencies, SOEs, and \nBUMDs that are in charge of infrastructure provision.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n94.  The implementation period for subprogram 2 is from 1 October 2006 to 30 September \n2008. All actions included in the policy matrix under subprogram 2 have been completed during \nthis time frame.  \n \n3.  Procurement and Disbursement  \n95.    The  subprogram  2  loan  of  $280  million  will  be  released  in  a  single  tranche  upon \neffectiveness.  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  finance  the  full  foreign  exchange  costs \n(excluding local duties and taxes) of items produced and procured in ADB member countries, \nexcluding the items specified in the negative list of ineligible items (Appendix 9) and imports \n                                                 \n35 The original 16 triggers for IDPL 2 have been reduced to nine, with the remaining seven deferred to 2009 under the \nnew IDPL 3. By contrast, subprogram 2 now has 74 outputs with some deferred to subprogram 3.  \n   ", "30    \nfinanced by other bilateral and multilateral sources. In accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s \ndisbursement  procedures  for  program  loans,36  the  proceeds  of  the  program  loan  will  be \ndisbursed to the Borrower. No supporting import documentation will be required, if the value of \nIndonesia\u2019s  total  imports  minus  imports  from  nonmember  countries,  ineligible  imports,  and \nimports financed under other official development assistance is equal to or greater than the \namount of the loan disbursed during the given year. The Government will certify its compliance \nwith this formula with its withdrawal request. Otherwise, import documentation under existing \nprocedures will be required. All goods and services produced and originating in ADB member \ncountries will be procured with due consideration to economy and efficiency, in accordance with \nthe Government\u2019s standard public procedures and normal private sector commercial practices \nacceptable to ADB. Goods commonly traded on the international commodity market will be \nprocured in accordance with procedures appropriate to the trade and acceptable to ADB.  \n \n4.  Anticorruption \n96.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy37  (1998  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed  with  the  Government.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \nloan regulations and the bidding documents for the Project.   In particular, all contracts financed \nby ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to \naudit and examine the records and accounts of the Executing Agency and all contractors, \nsuppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. All relevant ADB \nguidelines\u2014including  the  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time), \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time), and the loan \nregulations\u2014were specifically brought to the notice of the Government. The Government has \nconsiderably strengthened its anticorruption efforts in the past few years. Procurement reforms \nhave been under way for some time, resulting in competitive and relatively transparent selection \nof bidders by the public sector. The PSP regulatory framework, adopted as part of the IRSDP, \nsets out clear guidelines for the selection of private sector sponsors. KKPPI is tasked with \nensuring that the tendering processes are fair and transparent. Furthermore, the president of \nIndonesia  has  considerably  enhanced  the  profile  and  visibility  of  the  Anti-Corruption \nCommission and other law enforcement agencies to deal effectively with corruption. These \nsteps are already having an impact. \n \n5.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n97.    ADB retains the right to audit the use of loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the \nGovernment\u2019s  certification  for  the  withdrawal  application.  Prior  to  the  withdrawal,  the \nGovernment will open or nominate a deposit account at Bank Indonesia (Indonesian Central \nBank) to receive the loan proceeds. The account will be managed, operated, and liquidated on \nterms satisfactory to ADB.  \n \n6.  Performance Monitoring, Evaluation, and Program Review \n98.  As the IRSDP covers eight sectors, close to 20 line ministries and agencies, and a \nnumber  of  SOEs  and  BUMDs,  technical  coordination  and  progress  monitoring  have  been \ncritical. In line with its mandate, KKPPI has coordinated, leveraged, and monitored reform \nprogress within the broader context of the infrastructure policy package, presidential instructions \n6/2007 and 5/2008 (para. 13). The line ministries, as implementing agencies, have reported on \n                                                 \n36 ADB. 1998.

With TA support (footnote 9), the BAPPENAS \npart of the KKPPI secretariat strengthened the reporting system and assisted in resolving \nproblems and facilitating implementation of pending or delayed actions. The KKPPI secretariat\u2019s \nmonitoring  outcomes  have  been  reported  to  the  principal  development  partners  and  other \nstakeholders.  \n  \n99.    BAPPENAS, ADB, and JICA jointly reviewed implementation of subprogram 2 in May\u2013\nJune 2007 and April 2008. Findings from the reviews, which consisted of separate meetings \nwith each concerned ministry and agency38 followed by a wrap-up meeting chaired by the two \nKKPPI secretaries have been utilized in ensuring continuity and sustained progress of reforms, \nand  making  the  necessary  mid-term  corrections.  Joint  semi-annual  reviews  of  the  overall \nProgram performance shall be undertaken by BAPPENAS with ADB during SP3. BAPPENAS \nwill continue to monitor and evaluate the ongoing IRSDP, including consultations with central \nand regional authorities, infrastructure sector participants, civil society, and other stakeholders. \n \nVI.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS  \nA.  Expected Impacts \n100.  The key economic, social, and institutional benefits expected from the IRSDP are \n \n(i)  sustained progress in meeting the Government\u2019s medium-term economic growth \nobjectives, as articulated in the RPJM for 2004\u20132009; \n(ii)  improvements in the investment climate, to be demonstrated by sound policy, \nlegal, and institutional frameworks in the infrastructure sectors; \n(iii)  greater potential for PSP, and a more systematic approach for implementing PPP \ntransactions; \n(iv)  preparation and implementation of quality infrastructure projects in a transparent \nand  expedient  manner,  resulting  in  (a)  improved  availability  and  quality  of \ninfrastructure services; (b) a boost to Indonesia\u2019s competitiveness with regard to \nits regional neighbors; and (c) lower poverty incidence, through direct as well as \nindirect transmission channels; \n(v)  sustained engagement by ADB in the policy dialogue with the Government on the \ndirection  and  content  of,  and  strategies  for,  its  economic,  structural,  and \ninstitutional reform agenda in the broader area of investment climate; the IRSDP \nprovides for policy continuity and consistency in areas where ADB has been \nactively involved; and \n(vi)  aid harmonization and parallel financing by the key development partners around \na common policy framework and dialogue, and the positive externalities resulting \nfrom such a joint endorsement of the Government\u2019s reform agenda. \n \n101.  Institutional. The IRSDP is strengthening the key institutions dealing with infrastructure \ndevelopment  in  Indonesia.  At  the  national  level,  KKPPI,  its  secretariat,  and  the  RMU  are \nevolving  into  strong  institutions  that  coordinate  central  support  for  PSP  in  infrastructure \ndevelopment. The PPP unit at the central level will provide further support for the development \nof infrastructure projects covering all sectors. Within each infrastructure sector, the regulatory \nbodies will be strengthened over the medium term by enhancing their autonomy, clarifying their \nmandate, and providing adequate resources for their operations. The capacity to prepare and \nexecute  bankable  projects  is  being  systematically  built  up.  The  Government  is  developing \n                                                 \n38 For example, there were 20 such meetings in April 2008, during which progress was discussed in detail based on \nthe policy matrix, and measures were agreed to resolve problems and expedite implementation. \n   ", "32    \ninstitutions such as the IIFF and Guarantee Fund to support infrastructure financing. In addition \nto this, the existing domestic financial institutions are being strengthened.  \n \n102.  Social. The IRSDP\u2019s main contribution is to improve the investment climate and thereby \ncontribute directly to poverty reduction through greater access to markets, and economic and \nemployment opportunities. The policy reforms are intended to lead to increased infrastructure \ninvestments by the public and private sectors. On balance, the poverty and social impacts of the \nreforms and ensuing investments will be positive, through the benefits of induced economic \ngrowth  and  the  improved  provision  of  infrastructure  services.  The  May  2008  increases  in \ndomestic oil prices have freed up additional funds for more pro-poor spending. The Government \nis reviewing tariff policies in all sectors and adopting tariff regimes that are in line with cost-\nrecovery principles. At the same time, the impact of tariff increases on the poor is mitigated \nthrough appropriate measures, and the PSO framework is being strengthened to effectively \ndeliver essential infrastructure services. The adoption of market-based pricing promotes PSP, \nwhich  in  turn  leads  to  greater  tax  and  non-tax  revenues  and  additional  employment \nopportunities.  Potential  negative  impacts  include  social  dislocation  and  inadequate \ncompensation for land acquisition. The Government has established the Land Working Group to \ndeal with issues of land zoning and purchase of land in anticipation of future infrastructure \ndevelopments. The Government is also considering alternative approaches to provide speedy \ncompensation and enhance administrative accountability through transparent dispute resolution \nmechanisms. Overall, the IRSDP is leading to significant social benefits. Appendix 10 presents \na summary poverty reduction and social strategy. \n \n103.  Economic. The IRSDP reforms are expected to have short- and long-term net benefits. \nThese include a reduced fiscal burden from the gradual fuel subsidy removal and improved cost \nrecovery in all infrastructure sectors. The PSO policy framework provides the basis for better \ntargeting of infrastructure service provision, connectivity, and access for low-income groups. \nThe PDAM debt restructuring program will reverse the decline in service quality and coverage of \nwater supply and sanitation. PLN restructuring and tariff revisions will lower the Government \nsubsidy while improving PLN\u2019s efficiency. Passage of the Law on Electricity will pave the way for \nmedium- to long-term improvements in electricity supply and efficiency as the conditions for \nprivate sector investment improve and subsequent investment in generation increases, in turn \nimproving the overall investment climate. The introduction of independent transport and utility \nregulators in the longer term will remove government interference in utility operations and \npricing, providing the basis for improved efficiencies. Economic benefits are expected to accrue \nfrom improved quality of existing roads through better road maintenance and vehicle load \ncontrol and expanded road networks, by improving access to markets and other forms of \nconnectivity, and lowering vehicle operating costs. Major general economic benefits will accrue \nto  the  entire  Indonesian  population  through  the  expanded  scope  and  improved  quality  of \ninfrastructure services. \n  \n104.  The rigorous project preparation, screening, bidding, and contracting processes will \nenhance  the  direct  and  indirect  economic  impacts  of  individual  project  transactions.  Line \nministries  and  other  agencies  are  paying  greater  attention  to  determining  the  expected \neconomic and financial rates of return and assessing the benefits of proposed projects prior to \ntheir  approval.  This  helps  select  investments  with  higher  economic  returns  while  being \nfinancially  attractive  to  private  service  providers,  or  viable  to  public  providers.  Through  its \nsecretariat, KKPPI reviews the financial and economic analyses for all proposed PPP projects. \nThe IRSDP provides support to the KKPPI secretariat in this regard, and ensures that sound \nassessments are carried out and the economic benefits are highlighted. Overall progress in \nstructural reforms and in removing infrastructure bottlenecks will improve the private sector \nenabling environment and medium- to long-term growth prospects, while significant near-term \n ", " 33\ninvestments in infrastructure construction leveraged by the IRSDP boost capital formation and \ngenerate related employment and business for the construction industry.   \n \n105.  Resettlement, Indigenous People, and the Environment. Presidential regulations \n36/2005 and 65/2006 recognize traditional communal land ownership (Hak Ulayat) and usufruct \nrights. In line with the regulatory provisions, the rights of indigenous peoples will be upheld in \nthe  case  of  any  land  acquisition  involving  them.  These  provisions  are  in  conformity  with \nrequirements outlined in ADB's Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). Most of the reforms \nsupported by the IRSDP help improve environmental outcomes through better sanitation, higher \nelectricity prices to promote energy conservation, promotion of recycling, and sanitary landfills. \nBased on a desk review, the IRSDP measures are unlikely to have any adverse environmental \nimpacts. Further, while the IRSDP facilitates the preparation and tendering of several model \nPPP projects, it does not provide any investment support to such projects. Nonetheless, the \nGovernment,  through  KKPPI,  will  ensure  that  all  social  and  environmental  safeguards  are \ncomplied with in line with the prevailing laws and regulations. Any projects to receive ADB \nfinancing must comply with all of ADB\u2019s social and environmental safeguards requirements, as \ninvestment in this sector may lead to possible negative environmental impacts.  \n \nB.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n106.  Government Commitment. The political commitment could possibly waver because of \ninternal disagreements over policy directions, or because the entire Government may change \nafter the elections in 2009. The majority of opinions within the current Government confirm the \nnotion that the Government remains strongly committed to the reform program embodied in the \nIRSDP and the complementing IDPL program. The 2009 elections pose only a moderate risk of \nweakened  commitment  and  a  loss  of  the  reform  momentum,  as  even  with  a  change  of \nGovernment, the new leaders are expected to continue focusing on economic growth and \npoverty reduction to ensure a sound tenure in office and mitigate social and political unrest. \nHowever, should the new Government not be committed to maintaining the reform momentum, \nsubprogram 3 could be delayed or cancelled.  \n \n107.  Government Coordination. At times, the progress of infrastructure reforms has been \nimpeded by poor coordination among government ministries and agencies, and competing and \nconflicting interests of various stakeholders. While full and effective coordination and reforms in \ncertain sectors may take time to evolve and needs further consensus building, the essential \nsteps taken thus far will have a demonstrational effect in supporting infrastructure development \nin a coordinated manner in the coming years.   \n \n108.  Government Capacity. While the Government remains committed to reform objectives, \nthe ability to translate that commitment into practical reform achievements is subject to available \ncapacity within the different government ministries and agencies. In several areas, progress has \nbeen slower than was anticipated by the Government when the IRSDP was agreed upon. This \nhas typically been the result of low capacity, compounded by weak coordination. Mitigation \nstrategies  include  realistic  outputs  and  schedules  based  on  likely  reform  progress,  and \ncontinued provision of TA for capacity building. \n \n109.  Poor Governance and Corruption. With the high stakes involved in large infrastructure \nprojects in several sectors, the IRSDP may face significant impediments in the form of weak \ngovernance, collusion, and corruption, or lack of judicial capacity to enforce good-governance \nmeasures.  In  particular,  despite  the  commendable  rigid  stance  taken  by  MOF,  risks  of \nmisallocation of scarce public resources could still be encountered during the transition period, \nleading to government support for directly negotiated projects or projects that do not meet all \nrelevant criteria for such support. However, during the last few years the Government has \nconsiderably strengthened its anticorruption efforts. Procurement reforms have been under way \n   ", "34    \nfor some time, resulting in a competitive and transparent selection of bidders by the public \nsector. The PSP legal framework sets out clear rules for the selection of private sector sponsors \nfor  PPP  projects.  KKPPI  is  tasked  with  ensuring  that  tendering  processes  are  fair  and \ntransparent. The president of Indonesia has considerably enhanced the profile and activities of \nthe Anti-Corruption Commission and other law enforcement agencies. These steps are already \nhaving a significant impact.    \n \n110.   Economic Stability. Domestic macroeconomic volatility, adverse global events such as \nhigh oil and food prices, natural disasters, or the lack of sustained momentum on policy reforms \ncould impede PSP. However, over the last few years, the Indonesian economy has been quite \nresilient to domestic and external shocks, and the Government\u2019s macroeconomic policies have \nbeen sound. There is a risk of an adverse market reaction to growing expenditures on energy \nsubsidies. Indonesia has considerable gross financing needs and the cost of meeting these will \nalmost certainly go up if outlays on oil subsidies and budgetary financing needs continue to go \nup. In such an environment, a sharp deterioration in global economic conditions could make \nIndonesia particularly vulnerable to sudden shifts in investor sentiment, possibly triggering rapid \ncapital outflows and raising the risks of broader financial sector disruption.  \n \n111.  Social Tensions. Tariff reforms are sensitive in any environment, and Indonesia is no \nexception. As the country is gradually moving away from administered prices and tariffs for \ninfrastructure products and services, social tensions are inevitable. However, the Government \nhas so far been successful in reducing such tensions by the two-pronged approach of (i) \ncomprehensively socializing any planned price and tariff increases, and (ii) using the savings \nfrom the reduction in inefficient subsidies for direct poverty reduction, employment generation, \nand rural infrastructure development. \n   \nVII.  ASSURANCES \n112.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents:  \n \n(i)  Counterpart funds generated from the proceeds of the subprogram 2 loan will be \nused to finance the development needs as outlined under the subprogram 2 \nimplementation arrangements. \n(ii)  The  policies  and  actions  taken  prior  to  the  date  of  the  subprogram  2  loan \nagreement, as described in the letter of development policy (including the policy \nmatrix), will continue to be in effect for the duration of the IRSDP and thereafter. \n(iii)  The studies and technical designs prepared for the PPP projects will broadly \ncomply with all relevant ADB requirements, policies, and guidelines. \n(iv)  Recommendations resulting from the work done under the technical assistance \n(footnote 9) will be implemented to the fullest extent possible, and within a timely \nmanner. \n(v)  All necessary counterpart funds for program implementation will be provided fully \nand in a timely manner \n \nVIII.

Roads \n \n1.  Since roads account for the major share of domestic freight and interurban passenger land \ntravel, linking communities and markets throughout the country, their coverage and condition are \ncrucial to supporting economic growth and social development. Yet the arterial roads along major \ntrade and commercial corridors are becoming congested,1 and the regional roads have a low \ndensity.2 The network comprises only about 650 kilometers (km) of high-grade toll roads, of which \nmore than 75% was constructed and is operated by the state-owned Jasa Marga. National roads \ntotaling about 35,000 km and provincial roads totaling about 37,000 km are in relatively good \ncondition, but district and urban roads with a combined length of about 267,000 km are mostly in \npoor condition, and almost 50% of them are unpaved, thus restricting all-season access.  \n \n2.  While investments in road network upgrading and expansion were substantial in the 1980s \nand 1990s, sector expenditures decreased sharply after the 1997 Asian financial crisis, from a \npeak of about 22% of the national budget in the mid-1990s to about 10% after 2000. As evidenced \nby their mostly reasonable condition, national arterial roads have been fairly well preserved, but the \nbacklog of investments in network improvement and extension is growing. The regional situation is \nreversed, with underspending on preservation leading to greater strains than underspending on \nroad development.  \n \n3.  The current vehicle acquisition and ownership taxes, and fuel and other operational taxes, \nwould cover about 70% of the necessary road maintenance costs. However, proceeds from vehicle \nrevenues vary considerably between regions and are treated as general tax revenues of local \ngovernments, rather than being allocated to road preservation. The potential for financing the \nmaintenance of road assets on a self-sustaining basis is thus not utilized. Moreover, taxes imposed \non road users have been dwarfed by subsidies received in the form of low domestic prices of motor \nfuels. The gradual removal of fuel subsidies therefore needs to continue, with a portion of the \nsavings redirected to road development. While road preservation can be fully financed domestically \nthrough  restructured  road  user  charges,  additional  funds  from  the  private  sector  and  foreign \nborrowings need to be mobilized for road development. The private sector can be engaged in \nconstructing and operating about 1,500 km of high-grade toll roads to provide a complete trans-\nJava link and major parts of the trans-Sumatra link, while foreign borrowings should be used in an \nefficient manner for improving and extending the national arterial road network, rather than for road \npreservation. \n \n4.  Development of the road network, particularly toll roads, requires extensive acquisition of \nland. Until recently, the legal framework for land acquisition was inadequate, no specific role in the \nland acquisition process was assigned to the Ministry of Public Works and its toll road contracting \nand regulatory agency, and no specific funding was allocated for this purpose.  \n \nB.  Ports and Airports \n \n5.  As  Indonesia  is  an  archipelago,  ports  and  airports  are  of  vital  importance  to  regional \ncooperation and integration. In particular, the maritime sector (comprising ports and shipping) is a \nkey mode of domestic and international trade and passenger travel. There are 725 public ports and \n1,478 private ports (for bulk cargo), of which 141 are classified as international ports. Twenty-five \npublic ports have been designated by the Government as strategic ports, providing the main \n                                                 \n1 About 50% of the arterial network in Java is already congested, increasing travel times and transport costs. Costs are \nfurther increased by illegal payments demanded from truck drivers at checkpoints and weigh stations. \n2 At 0.18 kilometers (km) per square km or 1.5 km per 1,000 people, Indonesia\u2019s overall road density is among the lowest \nin Southeast Asia.   \n ", "40  Appendix 2 \ngateway for passengers and cargo, and handling most of the container traffic. In 2007, about 760 \nmillion tons (t) of cargo passed through the Indonesian ports. The number of passengers reached \n7.3 million in 2006. Cargo traffic, which was only slightly affected by the Asian financial crisis, is \nprojected to grow at 6% per annum in 2008 for international cargo and 4% per annum for domestic \ncargo. Sea passenger traffic declined after the crisis, and faces competition from the deregulated \nairline industry. A more moderate growth rate of 2% per annum is therefore projected. \n \n6.  There  are  deficiencies  in  basic  infrastructure  and  handling  equipment  in  ports.  Draft \nrestrictions in some of the strategic ports inhibit their ability to receive large vessels and fully \nparticipate  in  regional  trade.  Inadequate  equipment  is  the  main  cause  of  generally  low  port \nproductivity in terms of average berth occupancy rate, turnaround time, and containerization rate. \nOverall,  operational  performance  and  service  provision  have  not  met  client  expectations  and \ninternational performance standards. In particular, performance in container terminal operations is \nconsidered unsatisfactory by port users. Port tariffs are low, allowing full cost recovery only in \nlarger ports. With the introduction of the International Ship and Port Security Code in July 2004, all \nIndonesian international ports face the challenge of implementing strict security measures, as \nreceiving ports can reject docking of ships with cargo from ports that do not meet the code \nrequirements. \n \n7.  Air transport plays a vital role for passengers, high-value cargo, and mail by facilitating \nmobility, generating economic activity, and providing lifeline access to remote areas, thus helping \nintegrate  the  islands  across  the  country.  There  are  186  airports  in  Indonesia,  24  of  them \ninternational. In 2007, air traffic passengers\u2014departures and arrivals\u2014totaled about 54.8 million. \nThree airports\u2014Soekarno-Hatta in Jakarta, Ngurah Rai in Denpasar, and Juanda in Surabaya\u2014\naccounted for more than 80% of the passenger traffic. The aviation industry suffered from losses \nafter the Asian financial crisis, but has bounced back and is now carrying about three times as \nmuch traffic as in 1990. This is attributable to lower airfares as a result of opening air transport to \nprivate operators in 1999, and increasing geographic coverage of air transport services. Long-term \nprojections indicate annual growth of 5% for domestic passenger traffic and 6% for international \npassenger traffic. \n \n8.  While private airlines have reacted quickly to the market liberalization,3 the public sector \nhas  been  much  slower  in  expanding  airport  capacity.  Air  traffic  security  also  needs  to  be \naddressed. Domestic airport tariffs are kept artificially low and do not allow cost recovery for \nservices provided to passengers and air carriers. As a result, only major airports with significant \ninternational traffic are able to break even in their operations. The initiative for proposing increases \nin airport tariffs lies with the airport operator. However, the operator is required to consult with \nusers,  local  governments,  and  the  Ministry  of  Transportation  (MOT).  Experience  with  tariff \nincreases indicates that they are difficult to implement due to strong resistance, usually expressed \nduring the consultation process. As with ports, security of strategic airports needs to be enhanced \nto deal effectively with security concerns. \n \n9.  Until recently, the legal framework4 has specified that management of all general ports and \nall  airports  is  the  responsibility  of  the  Government,  which  can  delegate  it  to  a  state-owned \nenterprise (SOE). Private sector participation (PSP) has been allowed only through a cooperation \nagreement with such SOE. Based on this framework, the Government identified groups of ports \nand airports that were considered commercial (i.e., generated operating profits or had the potential \nto do so), and allocated their management and development to six SOEs: (i) 111 ports to four \n                                                 \n3 There were 14 domestic airlines in 2007. \n4 Maritime law 21/1992, Government regulation 69/2001, and the implementing ministerial decrees 53, 54, 55, and \n56/2002 for ports; and aviation law 15/1992, Government regulation 70/2001, and the implementing ministerial decrees \n44, 45, and 48/2002 for airports. This legal framework is being replaced by the recently enacted law 17/2008 on \nShipping and the new Law on Aviation that has been submitted to Parliament for approval. \n ", "Appendix 2       41 \nIndonesian port corporations (PELINDO I to IV), and (ii) 23 airports to two airport corporations \n(Angkasa  Pura  I  and  II).  In  reality,  these  portfolios  have  contained  a  mix  of  profitable  and \nunprofitable assets, arranged in geographic proximity, and with positive aggregate results. The \nSOEs have exercised monopoly rights over the ports and airports in their portfolios, managing all \naspects of operation, development, and PSP. They have also acted as a regulator in their domain, \nsetting tariffs for the use of port and airport infrastructure and for port and airport services in \nconsultation with MOT. Depending on the airport, MOT or Angkasa Pura I or II has provided air \ntraffic control services. This fragmented approach has presented coordination and safety problems. \n \n10.  Both ports and airports have good potential for PSP, but actual PSP has so far been low \ngiven the lack of a clear and predictable regulatory and investment environment, and the lack of a \nlevel playing field providing equal access and opportunities to all investors. In the port sector, three \nof the four PELINDOs formed joint ventures with private operators. However, these deal structures, \nwith the PELINDOs acting as both landlord5 and operator, have not brought about more PSP, as \npotential investors in new port terminals are concerned about getting fair treatment from a landlord \nwith a financial stake in an existing operator. PSP in the airport sector has been very limited, and \ngenerally taken the form of subcontracts for selected terminal services. Another impediment to \nPSP has been uncertainty caused by regional autonomy legislation, which has conferred authority \nover public works, including ports and airports, to local governments.6 This has created a potential \nfor conflict with the PELINDOs and Angkasa Puras. \n \nC.  Railways \n \n11.  The railway sector is very small in international terms and relative to Indonesia\u2019s area and \npopulation. It accounts for less than 10% of the country\u2019s total passenger traffic and only 0.6% of \nits total freight traffic. Railway operations are limited to predominantly passenger services in Java \nand three separate networks in Sumatra that carry mainly cargo such as coal and cement. The \ntotal rail length is less than 6,000 km (mainly single-track route-km), of which about one-quarter is \nnot in operating condition. Most railway assets are old and deteriorating (e.g., over two-thirds of \nserviceable rolling stock is more than 20 years old). Despite that, the average utilization of labor \nand infrastructure is higher than in Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam.  \n \n12.  Until recently, the Government through MOT has been responsible for sector policy and \nplanning, regulation, and provision of basic infrastructure such as rail tracks and signaling, while \nthe fully state-owned Indonesian Railway Corporation (KAI) has had the mandate to operate and \nmaintain the infrastructure and provide all rail transport services.7 PSP has been allowed through a \ncooperation agreement with KAI, but none has materialized. Since 2000, KAI has experienced \ndeclining and then stagnating demand due to low competitiveness of rail in relation to road, air, and \nferry services. Although reporting small profits, its real profitability has been obscured by poorly \nimplemented funding arrangements, as KAI operates within a complex web of subsidies, public \nservice obligation (PSO) arrangements, contracts with other SOEs, and caps on its economy-class \npassenger fares. \n \nD.  Power \n \n13.  Although the state-owned monopoly, the State Electricity Corporation (PLN), connected \nabout 32 million new customers to its system between 1974 and 2004 (i.e., an average of almost 1 \n                                                 \n5 Landlord port model is where the port authority owns all the assets and then leases them out to the private operators.  \n6 Law on regional autonomy 22/1999, Government regulation 25/2000, and the revised law on regional autonomy \n32/2004. Government regulations 69/2001 and 70/2001, issued to clarify the responsibilities of local governments, \nPELINDOs, and Angkasa Puras, have not achieved the desired result. \n7 Based on law 13/1992 on railways and the related implementing regulations, in particular the Government regulation \n69/1998 on Train Traffic and Transportation. This legal framework is being replaced by the new law 23/2007 on \nrailways and four new Government regulations drafted by MOT. \n ", "42  Appendix 2 \nmillion per year), the electrification ratio of 67% is still low by regional standards.8 More than 70 \nmillion people lack access to electricity, and about two-thirds of them live outside of Java and Bali \nwhere the cost of power supply is substantially higher. Because of the uniform tariff structure \nprevailing in Indonesia, PLN is losing money with every residential customer it connects outside \nthe Java-Bali grid. Given the potentially huge number of such consumers, there are limits to cross \nsubsidization  by  other  consumer  categories.  Rural  electrification  thus  runs  counter  to  PLN\u2019s \nobligation as an SOE to make a profit.9 The implication is that the Government\u2019s ambitious target of \nproviding electricity to 90% of the population by 2020 will be difficult to achieve with the business-\nas-usual approach.10 A new rural electrification strategy needs to be developed and implemented, \nbased on innovative decentralized models for design, financing, implementation, and operation. \nLocal development utilities, either in the form of a cooperative or a partnership between a local \ngovernment-owned enterprise (BUMD) and a private service provider, are a promising approach \nthat can be best pursued through a combination of centralized planning and coordination, and \ndecentralized implementation. \n \n14.  The Asian financial crisis resulted in almost no investment in power generation between \n1998 and 2004. As a result, PLN\u2019s current installed capacity of about 24,000 megawatts (MW), \nincluding about 4,000 MW contracted from independent power producers (IPPs), is insufficient to \nmeet peak demand outside the main grid of Java-Bali and leaves an inadequate reserve margin \nwithin the grid so that any unplanned power plant outage leads to load shedding. Because of the \ngradual removal of fuel subsidies, operation of the many captive, mostly diesel, power plants11 has \nbecome too costly. Power demand is projected to grow at an annual rate of 7%\u20139% through to \n2013. To meet the pent-up demand and displace high-cost oil-based generation that is the primary \ncause of PLN\u2019s sharply deteriorated financial position, a fast-track 10,000 MW program of coal-\nfired power plants is under implementation. The program, which is mostly financed by export \ncredits, domestic banks, and international bonds issued by PLN, is scheduled for completion by \n2010. In addition, PLN has a program for another 10,000 MW in IPP projects, mostly coal-fired and \ngeothermal, that are being put up for tendering in a staged manner.  \n \n15.  The  Electricity  Law  20/2002  provided  a  progressive  long-term  vision  for  power  sector \nrestructuring  by  unbundling  PLN,  independent  regulation,  competition,  and  PSP.  However,  in \nDecember 2004, the Constitutional Court annulled this law on the grounds that its provisions for \nunbundling  and  competition  violated  the  1945  Constitution.  The  annulment  was  based  on \ninterpreting the constitutional requirement for state control of important branches of production as \nan obligation for the Government and SOEs to act as owners and managers. The annulment has \nbeen a serious setback for power sector reforms, with potentially far-reaching consequences for \nsector efficiency and financial sustainability, as well as investor confidence. A new draft electricity \nlaw is undergoing deliberations in Parliament. Some members of Parliament, the Ministry of State-\nOwned  Enterprises,  and  key  stakeholders  (e.g.,  industry  and  trade  associations,  community \ngroups, and academics) have recommended splitting PLN into several entities and revoking its \nmonopoly rights. The generally held view is that the new law should allow for more participation \nfrom regional governments (e.g., by creating municipal utilities), the private sector, and community \nassociations. \n \n                                                 \n8 Other estimates indicate only 57%, but that seems to be too low. \n9  Law 19/2003 on state-owned enterprises. \n10  The average annual growth rate in the number of PLN customers of 11.1% during the past 30 years has been \nimpressive. However, two different patterns of growth occurred: 15.3% per year before the 1997 Asian financial crisis \nand 6.4% per year thereafter. The sharply lower postcrisis growth has been attributable to funding constraints and \nPLN\u2019s profit-making obligation. \n11  Approximately 10,000 companies maintain their own sources of power, mostly to mitigate the risks of grid supply \noutages. The combined installed capacity of these captive power plants is estimated at 13,000\u201315,000 MW, or almost \nhalf of PLN\u2019s total capacity.  \n ", "Appendix 2       43 \n16.  Through  a  series  of  electricity  tariff  increases,12  renegotiation  of  IPP  contracts,13  loan \nrestructuring, government subsidies,14 and efficiency improvements, PLN managed to overcome \nthe disastrous effects of the Asian financial crisis and gradually reduce its loss to Rp2.0 trillion in \n2004. However, the fuel subsidy removal in 2005 has had a major negative impact on the financial \nperformance of PLN, which uses diesel oil for almost 20% of its generation. As PLN was unable to \npass the sharp oil price increases on to its customers, government subsidies surged to Rp12.5 \ntrillion in 2005, Rp34.8 trillion in 2006, and Rp43.4 trillion in 2007. In the last 2 years, customers in \nall tariff categories were subsidized. In 2008 the subsidy is projected to reach Rp60.3 trillion as it is \nthe first time the average tariff does not even cover fuel costs.15  \n \n17.   Electricity tariffs, which are set by a presidential decree, are highly politicized. For IPPs, \nthis raises the issue of the credit risk of PLN. The Government has responded to demands for \nguarantees against this risk by referring to law 19/2003 on state-owned enterprises, according to \nwhich the Government can assign a special task to an SOE to manage a function for the public \nbenefit. If the special task is not financially viable, the Government must provide compensation to \nthe SOE. In PLN\u2019s case, the special task is the provision of electricity to all customer groups at \ntariffs determined by the Government and set uniformly across Indonesia. In recognition of this \nPSO assigned to PLN, the Government has been compensating it for the losses incurred in \nimplementing it. The Ministry of Finance specifies the procedure for calculation and payment of the \nsubsidy on an annual basis in a ministerial regulation.  \n \nE.  Oil and Gas \n \n18.  Indonesia has the largest proven natural gas reserves in the Asia and Pacific region, \naccounting for about 8% of the world\u2019s total proven reserves, and is the world\u2019s second-largest \nliquefied natural gas exporter from the fields in Aceh and Kalimantan. Despite that, the domestic \nuse of natural gas has been limited for two reasons: (i) the abundance of cheap oil until a few \nyears ago, and (ii) the lack of clarity regarding the legal and regulatory environment and poor \nincentives in terms of return on investment hampered expansion in current production-sharing \ncontracts and new gas field exploration. Several recent developments have set the stage for \nnatural gas to play a much more important role domestically: (i) Indonesia has become a net oil \nimporter, (ii) the gradual fuel subsidy reductions have made natural gas competitive, and (iii) the \nlegal and regulatory framework has been strengthened. As a result, private investors have started \nto develop new large gas fields, and PLN aims to substantially increase the share of natural gas in \nits  generation  mix.  Major  pipeline  projects  and/or  liquefied  natural  gas  terminals  need  to  be \nimplemented to bring natural gas to the Java market. \n \n19.  The  Oil  and  Gas  Law  22/2001,  together  with  the  related  implementing  regulations,16 \nprovided a basis for gas sector restructuring by (i) ending the monopoly of the State Oil and Gas \n                                                 \n12  The average electricity tariff was increased by 29% in April 2000, 17% in July/October 2001, and through quarterly \nadjustments of 6% during 2002\u20132003. These increases brought the average tariff from about $0.025 per kilowatt-hour \n(kWh) after the Asian financial crisis to $0.068/kWh in late 2003, a major accomplishment and proof of the successful \nsocialization by the Government of this politically sensitive issue. Since then, there have been no further increases and \nthe average tariff has slightly decreased, to $0.062/kWh, due to changes in the consumption structure. \n13  The renegotiations were a complex and protracted exercise with a successful final outcome. Of the 30 IPP contracts \ntotaling 11,300 MW, 14 contracts were continued under renegotiated terms, 7 contracts were terminated, 5 contracts \nwere acquired by the Government and its SOEs, 3 contracts were taken to international arbitration, and 1 contract is \nstill pending. \n14  The subsidies were introduced to compensate PLN for its low tariff for small consumers and amounted to Rp4.7 trillion \nin 2002, Rp4.1 trillion in 2003, and Rp3.5 trillion in 2004. \n15 The average selling price of electricity in 2008 of Rp614/kWh recovers only 56% of PLN\u2019s average production cost of \nRp1,092/kWh, of which Rp658/kWh is for fuel. \n16  The government regulations on implementing agency (BP Migas), regulatory agency (BPH Migas), corporatization of \nPertamina, upstream businesses, downstream businesses, and appointment of the head of implementing agency, as \nwell as the presidential decree on the establishment of regulatory agency, issued during 2002\u20142004.  \n ", "44  Appendix 2 \nCorporation (Pertamina), both in the upstream and downstream part of the sector, (ii) establishing \nseparate contracting authorities for these parts (BP Migas and BPH Migas), (iii) introducing the \nunbundling principle (a company which conducts business in the upstream part is prohibited from \nrunning downstream business, and vice versa), and (iv) calling for open access to gas transmission \npipelines. Though similar in its philosophy to the annulled Electricity Law 20/2002 (para. 15), the \nOil and Gas Law 22/2001 was upheld by the Constitutional Court in December 2005, except for \nprovisions related to domestic market obligations, and oil and gas pricing. The Constitutional Court \nruled that a minimum allocation for the domestic market should be stipulated for oil and gas \nproducers,  and  that  gas  prices  should  be  set  administratively  rather  than  be  determined  by \ncompetition.  \n \n20.  The current regulatory arrangements are complex and may lead to conflicts of interest, \nbecause they are partly combined with contracting. The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources \nis responsible for policy making, regulation of upstream activities and, together with BPH Migas, \nregulation of downstream activities.17 BP Migas acts as the contracting authority for upstream work \nand BPH Migas for downstream. The State Gas Corporation is the dominant player in downstream \ngas activities, having a market share of about 86% in gas transmission and 93% in gas distribution. \nIn 2003, the State Gas Corporation successfully completed the first public\u2013private partnership \nproject in gas transmission.18 By contrast, more recent attempts by BPH Migas to have further gas \npipelines implemented by the private sector have not been successful yet, mainly because of \ninadequate project preparation. \n \nF.  Telecommunications \n \n21.  This  sector  can  play  an  important  role  in  reducing  regional  disparities,  but  despite \nencouraging progress in wireless telecommunications, Indonesia is lagging behind many of its \nneighbors in terms of access, particularly in rural and remote areas. Until recently and except for a \nfew years when the impact of the Asian financial crisis was strongly felt across the country, the \nfixed line service showed double-digit annual growth since 1970. The total number of fixed lines \nexceeds 9 million, but given Indonesia\u2019s large population, the coverage of only about 6% is among \nthe lowest in the region.19 A large disparity exists between urban and rural areas. The six largest \ncities\u2014Bandung, Denpasar, Jakarta, Medan, Semarang, and Surabaya\u2014with less than 10% of the \ncountry\u2019s population account for almost 50% of all fixed lines. Their teledensity20 is about 40%, \ncompared to less than 1% in rural areas, where two-thirds of villages still have no public phone. As \nelsewhere in the region, the increased rollout of networks, availability of prepaid services, and \nfalling prices of handsets, have resulted in explosive growth of mobile communications since 1995. \nBetween 2005 and 2007, the number of mobile phone users almost doubled from 48 million (a \nteledensity of 21%) to 90 million (a teledensity of 39%), placing Indonesia above Viet Nam and \nIndia, but below the other neighboring countries.21 Internet access has grown less rapidly, mainly \ndue to regulatory and bandwidth constraints. There were an estimated 20 million internet users in \n2006. With the penetration rate of about 9%, Indonesia lags behind most countries in the region.22 \n \n                                                 \n17  The regulatory role within the ministry is exercised by its Directorate General of Oil and Gas (DG Migas). \n18  PGN created a subsidiary company for the construction and operation of the Grissik\u2013Duri\u2013Batam\u2013Singapore gas \ntransmission pipelines with a combined length of about 1,000 kilometers and divested a stake in this company to a \nstrategic investor through a competitive bidding process. The project was supported by an Asian Development Bank \nloan of $218 million, with cofinancing of $195 million provided by the Japan International Cooperation Agency.  \n19 In 2005, the fixed line coverage was about 4% in the Philippines, 5% in India, 11% in Thailand, 17% in Malaysia, 19% \nin Viet Nam, and 27% in the People\u2019s Republic of China. \n20 Defined as  count of main telephone lines and other connectivity means\u2019 for a particular area. \n21  In 2005, the mobile teledensity was about 8% in India, 11% in Viet Nam, 30% in the People\u2019s Republic of China, 40% \nin the Philippines, 43% in Thailand, and 75% in Malaysia. \n22  In 2005, the internet penetration rate was about 5% in India and the Philippines, 8% in the People\u2019s Republic of China, \n11% in Thailand, 13% in Viet Nam, and 42% in Malaysia. \n ", "Appendix 2       45 \n22.  Until 1999 the responsibility for the provision of telecommunications services was assigned \nto two SOEs. Telkom was designated as the so-called organizing body and granted exclusivity for \ndomestic services (both local and long distance), while Indosat played this role for international \nservices. Law 36/1999 on telecommunications and the related implementing regulations provided \nthe basis for major sector reforms. These were outlined in the 1999 sector blueprint that envisaged \na  gradual  transition  to  full  competition  by  2010.  The  Government  removed  the  respective \nmonopolies of Telkom and Indosat, partially privatized them,23 eliminated their cross-holdings in \nother operators, and established the Indonesian Telecommunications Regulatory Body (BRTI). \nWhile competition has been strong in the profitable mobile phone market,24 until recently Telkom \ncontinued to monopolize the fixed-line business, using its dominant position as a provider of basic \ninfrastructure. Telkom is also dominant in internet services.25  \n \n23.  Because of its political sensitivity, implementation of increases in tariffs for phone calls has \nbeen partial. In early 2002, the Government announced a plan to increase fixed-line tariffs by an \naverage of 45% within 3 years. The first phase of 15% was implemented in 2002, but the 2003 \nincrease was rejected by Parliament. In early 2004, the Government announced that it would allow \noperators to rebalance their tariffs, with the weighted average of tariffs increasing by 9%. This \nresulted in local tariffs increasing by 28% and long-distance tariffs falling by 10%.  \n \n24.  To ensure that all villages have access to basic telecommunications by 2010, in 2003 the \nGovernment launched the first phase of its universal service obligation program. It was based on a \nturnkey  approach,  with  infrastructure  and  equipment  financed  from  the  national  budget  and \nremaining under state ownership. Physical connections were installed in about 5,600 villages, \nmostly using expensive satellite technology. However, the outcome was below expectations, partly \ndue to maintenance difficulties and partly because the program did not anticipate the rollout of \nwireless  networks  to  many  of  the  target  villages,  which  made  the  use  of  satellite  phones \nunattractive to customers. The program has therefore been redesigned in terms of funding (a fixed \npercentage of annual gross revenues of telecommunications operators instead of the national \nbudget) and implementation (output-based contracting of construction, operation, and maintenance \ninstead of the turnkey approach to construction only). \n \nG.  Water Supply and Sanitation \n \n25.  Among the various infrastructure sectors in Indonesia, water supply and sanitation is in the \nworst technical condition, and its financial condition is also precarious. Unlike the situation in the \npower sector, there is no PSO subsidy from the central government, because management and \nservice delivery in water supply and sanitation are decentralized. It is estimated that in 2005, only \nabout 40 million people, or 18% of the population, were connected to piped water supply from \nregional water supply enterprises (PDAMs). Even in urban areas, only 33% of people receive piped \nwater. The remaining urban population depends on individual wells, small-scale providers, or water \nvendors, often at high cost. In rural areas, the situation is much worse. Only about 15% of rural \nhouseholds get drinking water from pipe or pump sources, with PDAMs accounting for about half of \nit.  The  majority  of  rural  households  still  rely  on  shallow  groundwater  extraction  or  rainwater \ncollection, or use surface water from nearby rivers or springs. The poor are affected most by this \nunsatisfactory situation. Countrywide, less than 20% of the poor have access to safe drinking \nwater, compared to more than 80% of the rich. The poor pay water vendors up to five times more \nthan the rich who use piped water.  \n \n                                                 \n23  The privatization started with the listing of Telcom and Indosat on the New York stock exchange in 1995, when about \n5% of shares were offered to the public. \n24  Ten  companies  have  national  licenses,  with  three  of  them\u2014Telkomsel  (Telkom  subsidiary),  Indosat,  and \nExelcomindo\u2014having a combined market share of about 98%. \n25  There are 150 licensed internet service providers, of which about 40 are active. Telkom controls over 60% of the \nmarket.  \n ", "46  Appendix 2 \n26.  Wastewater disposal is almost entirely handled by local governments. Indonesia has one of \nthe lowest rates of urban sewerage coverage in Asia. Only seven cities have some form of \nsewerage networks, and these reach just 10% of urban residents. Over 70% of urban households \nhave on-site sanitation, mostly in the form of septic tanks that are not functioning effectively. In \nrural areas, less than 30% of households have toilet facilities, and only about 20% have septic \ntanks.  The  lack  of  adequate  sewerage  systems,  combined  with  inadequate  solid-waste \nmanagement,  has  caused  widespread  contamination  of  surface  and  groundwater.  These \nconditions explain the high incidence of waterborne diseases. Indonesia has the highest incidence \nof typhoid in East Asia, and diarrhea is the second-largest cause of death among young children. \n \n27.  There are 335 PDAMs under the jurisdiction and ownership of local governments. Only \nabout one-quarter of them are technically and financially sound. The others are struggling, with \ntheir financial situation deteriorating and service quality falling. About 60% of the PDAMs are \nheavily indebted and 178 PDAMs, or 53%, have debt arrears. The total debt to the Ministry of \nFinance, including penalties, amounts to Rp6.7 trillion, with 32 PDAMs accounting for about 80% of \nit. Tariffs are generally well below cost-recovery levels, and often do not even cover costs for \noperation and maintenance. The PDAMs function with little autonomy from local governments, \nwhich keep tariffs artificially low and demand dividends that reduce funds for maintenance and \ninvestments.  At  40%\u201350%,  unaccounted-for  water  is  clearly  excessive  and  loss-reduction \nprograms have been mostly unsuccessful. The large number of PDAMs is also a concern, because \nmany are too small to be sustainable. \n \n28.  The sector suffers from low investment, a situation prevailing since the Asian financial \ncrisis.  Particularly  in  sanitation,  investment  has  been  almost  negligible,  and  cost  recovery  is \nconsidered irrelevant. Annual investments of about $400 million are estimated to be required to \nmeet the Millennium Development Goals for water supply and sanitation.26 The bulk of financing \nhas to come from cash generated by the PDAMs and local government budgets. This calls for \nmajor improvements in the self-financing capacity of PDAMs, and in the borrowing capacity and \nfinancial management of local governments. Ensuring access of the latter to long-term finance is \nparticularly  important.  The  gap  between  the  investment  needs  and  public  sources  of  funds, \nincluding foreign borrowing, has to be closed by greater PSP.27 As it is beyond the technical and \nfinancial capability of PDAMs to increase access in rural areas, the community-driven development \nof small water supply and sanitation facilities has to be intensified. \n                                                 \n26  The target is halving by 2015 the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water, and \nsignificantly improving by 2020 the lives of at least 100 million slum dwellers through improved sanitation and other \nmeasures. \n27  Except for three water supply concessions (two in Jakarta and one in Batam), PSP in the sector has been low. \n ", "Appendix 3  47 \nCONSTRAINTS

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nPrior to the Asian financial crisis, Indonesia had been successful in fighting poverty, with poverty rates in terms of population \nliving below $1/day dropping from more than 50% in 1970 to 16% in 1996. However, at the peak of the crisis in 1998, the \npoverty incidence reached an alarming 24%. Although it has been steadily falling since then, poverty remains persistent in \nIndonesia. Recent surveys suggest that about half of the population still live below the $2/day international poverty line. \nContinued economic growth has lifted living standards; however, the benefits of economic growth are not equally distributed \namong the population. Rural poverty is significantly higher that urban poverty, with about 60% of the country\u2019s poor living in \nrural areas. Causes of both urban and rural poverty include absence of economic opportunities, lack of access to key social \nservices, and poor infrastructure.  \n \nTo accelerate infrastructure development and thereby support higher economic growth and faster poverty reduction, the \nGovernment has launched a series of policy reforms that liberalize markets and allow competition from new entrants, \nstrengthen regulatory arrangements, introduce tariff regimes based on full cost recovery or provide compensation to meet \npublic service obligations, and establish effective mechanisms for dispute resolution. The Government\u2019s National Strategy for \nPoverty Reduction (SNPK) has identified rural infrastructure investments as a key to reducing poverty and regional disparities. \nInfrastructure investments will contribute to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), as improved infrastructure \nwill enhance poor people\u2019s access to social services and markets and generate income and employment opportunities. In line \nwith the SNPK, the Government\u2019s Medium-Term Development Plan 2004\u20132009 (RPJM) underlines the need for increased \ninvestments in infrastructure in general and in rural infrastructure in particular as an important vehicle of reducing poverty. In \nApril 2007, the Government launched the National Program for Community Empowerment (PNPM Mandiri), which builds upon \nIndonesia\u2019s accumulated experience with community-driven infrastructure development and focuses on improving service \ndelivery in rural areas by providing block grants for rural roads, water and sanitation facilities, and developing education and \nhealth services.   \n \nThe IRSDP supports achievement of the RPJM\u2019s economic growth and poverty reduction targets. It is also included in the \nAsian Development Bank\u2019s overall strategy which sees infrastructure investments as a key area of engagement to address \npoverty and regional disparities, and achieve the MDGs.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \nKey Issues  \n \nAccording to recent estimates, about half of Indonesia's 235 million people are considered to be poor and survive on less than \n$2 a day; about 18% live on $1 or less. In addition, a significant portion of Indonesia's population has an income that is just \nabove the poverty line. A large proportion of vulnerable people are thus at risk of falling into poverty due to rising inflation \ncaused by increases in food and oil prices, and the impacts of natural disasters. Poverty-related challenges in Indonesia are \nnot only the large number of poor but also the striking disparities between regions, provinces, districts, and cities.   \n \nThe Asian financial crisis of 1997 led to a steep decline in infrastructure investments. Private sector investment almost \ndisappeared. At the same time, the Government realized that the public sector had borne a disproportionate share of the risks \nin the infrastructure sectors, and stopped providing any risk-sharing support. With infrastructure investments currently at \naround 3% of gross domestic product (GDP), about 50 million people do not have access to treated water, 90 million are \nwithout electricity, and about 200 million are without connections to a sewerage network. The poor suffer disproportionately \nfrom lack of access to basic infrastructure services. Availability of services is generally lower in rural areas, contributing to \nsignificant regional disparities in development. \n \nTo address issues of poverty caused by lack of adequate infrastructure facilities and poor access to infrastructure services, \nthe IRSDP aims to increase both public and private infrastructure investments. These, in turn, will improve the climate for \ninvestments in productive sectors,  which  will generate  better economic and employment opportunities. By  enhancing \ninfrastructure provision and access, the IRSDP contributes to achieving the Government\u2019s medium-term macroeconomic \ngoals, in particular realizing average annual GDP growth of 6%\u20137% during 2005\u20132009 and sustaining such growth thereafter, \nwhich will result in reducing poverty.  \n ", "78  Appendix 10 \n  \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n \nIndonesia\u2019s infrastructure is deteriorating; electrification rates are the lowest in the region, with more than 70 million people \nstill lacking access to electricity. Indonesia has the lowest road density in the region, of 0.18 km per square kilometer (km) or \n1.5 km per 1,000 people. Only about 40 million people or 18% of the population are connected to a piped water supply; even \nin urban areas only 33% have access to piped water. Urban sewerage coverage is one of the lowest in Asia. Access through \nfixed telecommunication lines is among the lowest in the region, with only about 4 lines per 100 people, compared to 18\u201320 \nlines elsewhere. \n \nRoad conditions in rural areas are particularly poor; more than 15% of all Indonesian villages are inaccessible even by four-\nwheel-drive vehicle at certain times of the year. A lack of access to infrastructure results in location poverty, where people \nliving in isolated areas with difficult geography and poor market links lack both economic opportunities and adequate levels of \nservice delivery. Investments in transportation infrastructure, agricultural infrastructure (irrigation), and educational and health \nfacilities can significantly improve living conditions in remote areas, create the basis for economic growth, and make a major \ndifference in the welfare of the local population. Poor quality roads or even no roads mean that government services seldom \nenter the region. Once isolated regions can be reached, services will follow. The positive effect of infrastructure on rural \nwelfare has been empirically demonstrated. Surveys revealed that the presence of good roads is strongly correlated with the \nlevel of mean income of communities.  \n \nConsultation and Participation \n1. Summary of the consultation and participation process during the Program preparation: \nThe IRSDP is part of the Government\u2019s broad reform agenda and is anchored in the Government\u2019s comprehensive \nInfrastructure  Policy  Package.  It  was  designed  through  a  participatory  process  involving  major  government  and \nnongovernment stakeholders at the national level, and development partners. Participation took place through regular \nconsultations. During its implementation, broad stakeholder participation has been maintained. The IRSDP leads to (i) an \nimproved policy, legal, and institutional framework anchored on good-governance principles, (ii) an improved coordination \nmechanism for ministries and agencies involved in infrastructure development, (iii) a well-structured risk management \nframework that promotes private sector participation, (iv) accelerated mobilization of domestic long-term financial resources \nfor infrastructure development, and establishment of innovative funding mechanisms for public\u2013private partnership projects, \nand (v) a streamlined regional autonomy framework, clearly delineating functional responsibilities of the national and local \ngovernments in infrastructure provision. Further, the IRSDP promotes reforms for transportation, power, oil and gas, water \nsupply and sanitation, and telecommunications leading to (i) better sector planning and project preparation, (ii) improved \nfinancial soundness and sustainability of infrastructure services through full cost recovery, (iii) greater competition that \nbenefits consumers through improved service delivery and lower tariffs, (iv) independent regulatory structures that are distinct \nfrom the contracting and operating functions, (v) equal access for all participants in infrastructure provision, and prevention of \nabuse of natural monopoly rights, and (vi) fulfillment of public service obligations in infrastructure provision, in line with the \nGovernment\u2019s poverty reduction objectives.  \n \n2.
