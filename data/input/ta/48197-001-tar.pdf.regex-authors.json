INTRODUCTION \n1.  Managing  for  development  results  (MfDR)  is  an  approach  to  orient  the  five  core \nfunctions of management\u2014planning, budgeting, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation\u2014to \ndeliver  on  intended  results.  MfDR  is  recognized  as  a  key  approach  to  development \neffectiveness. Efforts by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to promote MfDR focus on three \naspects:  (i)  supporting  MfDR  capacity  development  in  ADB  developing  member  countries \n(DMCs), (ii) integrating a results-focused approach across ADB operations, and (iii) sustaining \npartnerships with development partners on MfDR initiatives. \n \n2.  To reinforce this DMC support, in 2006 ADB established the first regional network on \nMfDR, the Asia-Pacific community of practice (APCoP) on MfDR. This has now been emulated \nby  other  development  partners  through  their  own  regional  CoPs.1 APCoP\u2019s  dialogue  and \nknowledge products center on promoting MfDR through a framework that highlights the key \nfeatures for a results-based public sector management (PSM) system.2 This framework has \nbeen  developed  into  a  guide  for  ADB  staff  for  conducting  public  sector  management \nassessments, and has been adopted by the other regional CoPs on MfDR. This APCoP support \nis consistent with ADB\u2019s long-term Strategy 2020 vision and the commitment to deliver results, \nand  promotes  knowledge  sharing  through  finance++  initiatives. 3  APCoP\u2019s  activities  are \ndetermined through a coordinating committee composed of senior government officials, with the \nsecretariat housed in the Results Management Unit of the ADB Strategy and Policy Department. \n \n3.  APCoP  has  grown  and  matured  into  a  DMC-driven  CoP  with  approximately  1,000 \nmembers. It  has  a  proven  record  as an  innovative  and  effective  vehicle  to  assist  APCoP \nmembers mainstream, create, and share knowledge, and promote dialogue on results-based \nPSM. In the last 5 years there have been increasing requests to supplement regional activities \nand expand support for country-level piloting of innovative MfDR initiatives that could later be \nmainstreamed. This support for demand-driven initiatives would enhance the experience of \nAPCoP members, and increase regional knowledge-sharing. The proposed regional capacity \ndevelopment  technical  assistance  (TA)  responds  to  requests  from  members  for  expanded \nsupport  at  the  country level  for  results-based PSM  initiatives.4 The  design  and  monitoring \nframework, which reflects lessons from earlier ADB support, is in Appendix 1.5      \n \n \n \n                                                \n1  The African Development Bank and the Inter-American Bank support similar regional CoPs and the APCoP has \nworked with them on interregional events. APCoP comprises senior government officials engaged in central and \nsector agencies who are involved in public sector management. APCoP also includes development practitioners \nand experts, other regional CoPs on MfDR, and multilateral and bilateral development partners. \n2  Asia-Pacific Community of Practice on Managing for Development Results. 2011. Framework for   Results-Based \nPublic Sector Management. Manila: Asian Development Bank. Public sector management comprises the five \ncomponents of planning, resource allocation, implementation, monitoring and evaluation. \n3  ADB 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila. In finance ++ the first \u2018plus\u2019 is leverage and the second \u2018plus\u2019 is knowledge. \n4  The need for support has been expressed in surveys of APCoP members, dialogue with other multilateral \ndevelopment banks, other regional CoPs on MfDR, and from the positive responses to pilot initiatives that earlier \nTA projects have supported. In 2013, APCoP published a review, Asia-Pacific Community of Practice on Managing \nfor  Development  Results.  2013.  Promoting  Results through  Country-Based  Communities of  Practice,  which \nsummarized the role of CoPs such as APCoP in developing capacity and promoting results, reflected on lessons, \nand suggested future actions, including demands by members for country-level support on innovative approaches \nthat would enhance knowledge and practical experience. \n5  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 19 March 2014. \n ", "2   \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  Public  expenditure  reviews  persistently  highlight  weak  PSM  systems  in  DMCs  that \nconstrain the delivery and assessment of development initiatives.6 This is not unique to least-\ndeveloped countries, as countries that have already achieved or are aspiring to achieve middle-\nincome status face similar challenges, albeit at a different level. \n \n5.  Two elements define the character of PSM in ADB DMCs. The first is the nature of the \nkey challenges faced by their governments, e.g., economic and social inequality, exclusion, \npoor governance undermined by corruption, a limited ability to protect the environment, and the \nneed for higher levels of growth. The second is weak public sector managers who are working \nwith weak public administration systems that are struggling to modernize, reduce their resource \nrequirements, and for many of the DMCs assist in the national effort to break out of the \u201cmiddle-\nincome country trap\u201d.7 Given this context, especially as regards inequality and exclusion, PSM \nneeds  to  focus  on  the  provision  of  socially  effective,  equitable  services  underpinned  by \nlegitimate governance. Suitable policies, programs, and institutional structures are essential \nelements, which need to be complemented by effective implementation by public administration \nsystems. To be effective, all components of a robust, results-based PSM system must be \npresent. PSM capacity development in DMCs\u2014both in terms of system enhancement and \nindividual capacity strengthening\u2014has been short term, is often supply-driven, and suffers from \ninadequate attention to the lack of necessary results dimensions that perpetuate weak PSM \nsystems. \n \n6.  MfDR introduces features that, when applied to PSM, will enable countries to better plan, \nallocate resources, implement, monitor, and evaluate for results. Results-oriented PSM is key to \ndevelopment effectiveness as it improves delivery of services, and enables governments to \nmake informed decisions and allow for continuous learning to sustain development outcomes. \nEfforts  to  develop  and  adopt  these  capabilities  have  been  successful  in  helping  public \nmanagement in a wide range of countries to improve their social and economic performance. \nFor example, results-focused monitoring and evaluation (M&E) highlights the requirements for \neffective service delivery by providing the empirical basis to assess whether expected outputs \nand outcomes have been achieved. More importantly, it makes explicit the extent to which \nintended results are achieved and ultimately what value is added, and at what cost. This in turn \ninforms future planning, resource allocation and implementation. \n \n7.  However,  mainstreaming  results-based  approaches  requires  some  adaptation, \nespecially in the orientation of public sector managers. The establishment of APCoP and the \ndevelopment of its members as \u201cchange agents\u201d have proven to be an integral and successful \nelement in undertaking this adaptation; their understanding of cutting-edge challenges can help \nto transform weak PSM systems into robust results-based systems. \n \n8.  Support to APCoP has been provided over three phases: phase 1 (a pilot phase in 2006); \nphase 2 (the development phase from 2007 to 2010); and phase 3 (an expansion phase from \n2011 to 2013). APCoP establishment, development, and expansion was made possible by: (i) \n                                                \n6  The review of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020 by ADB\u2019s Independent Evaluation Department highlighted the important role of \nresults-based PSM in ensuring the effective delivery of development initiatives. \n7  The \u201cmiddle-income trap\u201d is the phenomenon of hitherto rapidly growing economies stagnating at middle-income \nlevels and failing to graduate into the ranks of high-income countries. Avoiding the middle income trap entails \nidentifying strategies to introduce new processes and find new markets to maintain export growth. Ramping up \ndomestic demand is also important\u2014an expanding middle class can use its increasing purchasing power to buy \nhigh-quality, innovative products and help drive growth. \n ", "  3 \nthe shared concept of results-based PSM, which was identified, developed, and applied through \na common framework; (ii) the APCoP membership, which began with 100 members in 2006 and \nexpanded  and  diversified  over  the  next  two  phases  to  over  1,000  members;  (iii)  APCoP \nprograms, which moved from online discourse to face-to-face meetings that became regularized \nin  regional  centers  of  excellence  on  cutting-edge  themes;  and  (iv)  financing,  which  was \noriginally dependent solely on funding through ADB\u2019s main TA facility, and is now increasingly \nself-financed by DMC governments. Finally, in terms of results, APCoP has moved from being a \nnetwork within the Asia and Pacific region requiring capacity development, to one in which \nmembers are increasingly able to articulate a DMC perspective on results-based PSM through \nintraregional and interregional dialogue. In addition, APCoP members are increasingly able to \ndemonstrate the ability to apply MfDR concepts in strengthening results-based PSM systems \nand policies. Future support aims to sustain these successes by mainstreaming results-based \nPSM at the country level, through an extensive, diversified network of APCoP members that can \ninteract  effectively  in  South\u2013South  dialogue  through  self-financed  mechanisms.  ADB\u2019s  role \nwould be to catalyze these interactions, work closely with centers of excellence, and bring \ntogether best practices and experts to engage with APCoP. \n \n9.  The TA will promote demand-driven capacity development assistance. APCoP members \nwill  be  supported  in  country-level  work  on  results-based  PSM  as  requested  by  member \ncountries or through ongoing programs of ADB regional departments to promote sustainability of \noutcomes. The TA will strengthen results-based PSM systems\u2014such as M&E, evaluation policy, \nand planning and budgeting systems\u2014based on a country\u2019s specific circumstances. The CoP \nmodality provides an effective forum for DMC officials to discuss specific sector issues and \nimprove  their  governance  systems.  Results-based  PSM  also  provides  complementary  and \ndeepened ADB support to country operations. APCoP assistance enables governments to move \ntoward results-based management of sectors, particularly ADB priority sectors over the longer \nterm. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact of the TA is that MfDR approaches will be further advanced in participating \ncountries.  This  will  be  demonstrated  through  replication  or  expansion  of  plans  for  MfDR \napproaches  in  PSM  in  other  sectors,  ministries,  and  departments.  The  outcome  will  be \nincreased application of MfDR by APCoP members in their country contexts. The outcome will \nbe seen in the number of APCoP members reporting application of MfDR approaches on \nresults-based PSM and MfDR principles applied in national and sector development plans or \nframeworks, knowledge products, and workshops and conferences, among others.     \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  This TA supports APCoP members through country-level and regional activities. To \nachieve its outcome, the TA will deliver three outputs: (i) results-based PSM assessments \nundertaken country-level activities, (ii) South\u2013South dialogue enhanced, and (iii) best practices \nin PSM distilled and disseminated.  \n \n12.  The TA will focus on supporting capacity development on MfDR at the country level, \nspecifically developing plans for MfDR approaches in PSM through training and workshops on \nspecific  country-level  PSM  issues.  At  least  four  country-level  activities  initiated  by  APCoP \n ", "4   \nmembers will be supported under this TA. These will be selected during the course of TA \nimplementation in close cooperation with ADB regional departments.  \n \n13.  Support for the country initiatives will focus on national, subnational, or sector PSM \nissues; these will serve to bring together senior government officials from the central (planning \nand finance) and sector ministries, technical experts, and civil service organizations to focus on \nspecific results-based PSM issues. This will begin to establish country-based CoPs on MfDR to \nmirror the work of APCoP members at a regional level. APCoP members will use the results-\nbased PSM framework8 as a tool to lead assessments in selected DMCs. The assessments will \nbe undertaken through the gap analysis in selected DMC PSM systems and identifying the \ncapacity-building  initiatives  needed  to  make  the  PSM  processes  results-oriented,  and  to \nenhance achievement of national outcomes. This process will assess PSM issues at a national \nlevel or for specific sectors. The assessment process, capacity initiatives, and implementation \nexperiences will be distilled into knowledge products. This bottom-up approach will strengthen \nthe ownership, accountability, and sustainability of proposed capacity development initiatives. \nAPCoP\u2019s  capacity  development  assistance  could  respond  to  requests  initiated  by  APCoP \nmembers on MfDR, and involve APCoP members working with ADB regional departments to \nidentify issues through joint country-based PSM assessments to (i) better inform project, sector, \nand country strategies; and (ii) strengthen the implementation of proposed or ongoing results-\nbased PSM loan and TA initiatives. \n  \n14.  The TA will enhance South\u2013South dialogue by bringing together APCoP members at the \nsubregional level to share their country-level MfDR implementation experiences. APCoP will \nhold two knowledge-sharing seminars in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and one in \nSingapore. Topics that could be discussed include cutting-edge practices on PSM in the Asia \nand Pacific region, such as results-based management in country systems, and thematic and \nsector PSM issues.  \n \n15.  Best practices on PSM will be distilled and disseminated through a regional knowledge-\nsharing conference of APCoP members to be held in the PRC, and through publications from \nthe country-level PSM work, South\u2013South dialogues, and the regional knowledge-sharing event. \nAPCoP  will  conduct  the  regional  conference  in  cooperation  with  international  experts  and \npartners  to  share  their  experiences  on  capacity  building  for  results-based  management  of \nselected  sectors  and  thematic  focus,  such  as  targeted  equitable  growth,  public  sector \nstrengthening for public-private partnerships, and monitoring of education and health sector \nindicators,  among  others.  This  approach  will  promote  a  bottom-up  approach  to  distilling \nknowledge from the countries on their PSM implementation experiences. The existing APCoP \nwebsite will continue to facilitate knowledge storage, sharing, and dissemination.  \n \n16.  There are a number of risks and assumptions associated with the TA outcome and \noutputs, as listed in the design and monitoring framework. At the outcome level, it is assumed \nthat the MfDR plans and frameworks will be promoted by the government, because a criterion \nfor country selection is that the assistance is demand-driven, i.e., requested by the DMC or \nthrough  existing  ADB  operations.  There  is  a  risk  that  senior  government  officials  lack \ncommitment to develop and implement MfDR systems. This will be mitigated through the other \nTA outputs and components, specifically those dealing with South\u2013South dialogue and expert \nsupport.    \n \n                                                \n8  Asia-Pacific Community of Practice on Managing for Development Results. 2011.

The total cost of the TA is $500,000, which is to be financed on a grant basis by the \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China  Regional  Cooperation  and  Poverty  Reduction  Fund  and \nadministered by ADB. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  ADB, through the Results Management Unit of the Strategy and Policy Department, will \nbe  the  executing  agency  of  the  TA  and  will  be  responsible  for  overall  management  and \nmonitoring of the activities. To increase DMC ownership, the coordinating committee, composed \nof senior DMC public officials, will guide TA implementation.9 The Results Management Unit, as \nsecretariat of the APCoP, will coordinate activities with ADB regional departments (through the \nMfDR focal point network), resident missions, and its Regional and Sustainable Development \nDepartment.  All  TA  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  the  ADB  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (May 2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n19.  The TA will be implemented over 14 months, commencing 1 May 2014 and ending 30 \nJune 2015. It will require two international consultants on an intermittent basis for the duration of \nthe regional TA (up to 4.5 person-months of work). The international Technical Advisor will be \nresponsible  for  identifying  key  PSM  issues  for  consideration  by  the  CoP;  overseeing \npublications  on  emerging  topics  on  results-based  PSM;  sourcing  experts;  and  discussing \nworkshop contents with PSM practitioners. High-quality, experts consultants will support the \ncountry-level CoP-driven PSM interventions in selected DMCs, and will be engaged on an \nintermittent basis (about 1 person-month of work in total). Two full-time and one part-time \nnational consultants will be required for financial, administrative, management, and research \nsupport for TA activities, particularly for the DMC-based workshops (which will range from 8 to \n14 person-months each). International subject matter experts will also be engaged as resource \npersons and facilitators. All consultants will be recruited on an individual basis in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). \nEquipment  will  be  purchased  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines (2013  as \namended from time to time), and will be handed over to the relevant department administering \nthe TA at the end of the TA period. The outline terms of reference for consultants is in Appendix \n3.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to be financed on a \ngrant basis by the People's Republic of China Regional Cooperation and Poverty Reduction \nFund for Mainstreaming Results-Based Public Sector Management\u2014Supporting the Initiatives \nof the Asia-Pacific Community of Practice on Managing for Development Results, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board.  \n \n \n \n                                                \n9  The  APCoP  coordinating  committee  consists  of  six  senior  government  officials  from  Cambodia,  Malaysia, \nMongolia, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka.
