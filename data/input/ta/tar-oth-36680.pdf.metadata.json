Cities  Alliance1  (CA)  is  a  global  alliance  of  cities  and  their  development  partners \ncommitted to improving the living conditions of the urban poor through advocacy and the \npromotion  of  pro-poor  city  development  strategies  (CDS)  and  cities  without  slum  (CWS) \ninitiatives that develop citywide and nationwide slum upgrading programs.  CA was launched \nwith the vision of cities without slums. CA pursues its mandate by (i) pooling the resources and \nexperience of partners, (ii) focusing on cities and not sectors, (iii) promoting partnerships among \ngovernments and organizations representing  the urban poor, (iv) promoting inclusive urban \ncitizenship, (v) helping to scale up successful solutions to the citywide and nationwide levels, \n(vi) encouraging slum dwellers to be engaged as participating partners, (vii) promoting the role \nof women in city development, and (viii) engaging potential investors.  \n \n2.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) joined CA in 2002 through regional technical \nassistance (TA) 60262 to become a more effective development partner for reducing urban \npoverty in the Asia and Pacific region (the Region). CA membership makes this possible by \ncreating opportunities for (i) access to CA's collective body of knowledge, experience, lessons \nlearned, and good practices on urban poverty reduction; (ii) participation in and contribution to \nthe global forum for the advocacy of urban poverty issues in the Region; and (iii) leveraging of \nADB's TA for the urban sector with cofinancing3 grants from CA for CDS and CWS activities \nlinked to the operations program.  The benefits of CA membership for ADB include  (i) the \nraising of  ADB\u2019s profile as a major contributor to urban poverty reduction in the Region; \n(ii) improved quality, efficiency, development impact and effectiveness for ADB\u2019s urban sector \nTA and lending operations and (iii) better urban sector analysis and understanding of issues. CA \nis a powerful and prestigious international collaboration and CA membership helps place ADB \nas an urban development leader and a more effective advocate for prosperous cities without \nslums.  \n \n3.  Through TA 6026, ADB entered into a memorandum of agreement4 with CA, made an \nannual contribution of $250,000 to the Cities Alliance Asian Development Bank Trust Fund \n(CA ADB Trust Fund), and provided $420,000 for the preparation of CDS and CWS programs. \nThe CDS and CWS initiatives were undertaken in selected cities5 identified in close consultation \nwith  the  concerned  regional  departments,  and  the  governments  of  India,  Philippines,  and \nViet Nam. The CDS and CWS experiences were discussed and disseminated at a series of \nnational workshops held in each country and a concluding regional workshop held in Manila in \nMay 2003. The final report, \"City Development Strategies to Reduce Poverty,\" includes the \nworkshop proceedings and is being prepared for publication in printed and compact disc (CD) \nformats.  \n                                                 \n1  CA was launched in 1999, led by the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements (UN-HABITAT) and the World \nBank (WB). Other CA members are:  Bilateral Development Agencies: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, \nNetherlands, Norway, Sweden, United Kingdom, and United States; Multilateral Development Agencies: ADB and \nthe United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP); and Local Authorities Associations: the International Union of \nLocal Authorities, Metropolis, United World Federation of United Cities (formerly United Towns Organization), and \nWorld Assembly of Cities and Local Authorities. \n2  ADB. 2002.  Promoting Urban Poverty Reduction Through Membership in Cities Alliance. Manila (TA 6026, for \n$670,000, approved on 13 March 2002). \n3   As of 30 June 2003, CA had received funds of $57.5 million and approved globally grants totaling $42 million. CA \naims to mobilize $115 million in grant support for the CWS Action Plan for 2000\u20132005. \n4  Agreement between the Asian Development Bank and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development \nand the International Development Association for the Cities Alliance Asian Development Bank Trust Fund \n(TF050888), dated 5 March 2003. \n5  The cities are Calicut in India; Caloocan, Quezon, and Taguig City in the Philippines; and Da Nang in Viet Nam. ", "2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  By 2020, half of all Asians are expected to live in cities and towns. Sixteen of the world's \n26 megacities, each with a population in excess of 10 million, will be in Asia. Urban poverty and \nurban environmental degradation are among Asia's most pressing development challenges. \nThroughout the Region, millions of Asians are living in urban squalor, trapped in highly polluted \nand socially deprived slums, devoid of basic public services. National prosperity depends on the \nefficiency and competitiveness of cities. The economic and social success of cities and the \nwell-being  of  urban  population  depends  on  effective  leadership,  good  governance,  and \nparticipatory decision-making about urban development. Bold measures are needed to help \ncities face these challenges and become prosperous and slum-free. CA is demonstrating a \nremarkable capacity to support cities in this work.  \n \n5.  CA's objectives and approaches are consistent with ADB's Urban Sector Strategy6 \nobjectives of (i) maximizing the economic efficiency of urban areas; (ii) reducing urban poverty \nthrough reduced unemployment and improved access to land, infrastructure, and services; \n(iii) improving the quality of life through a range of measures affecting local environmental \nsanitation, gender and development, and participatory decision making; and (iv) achieving \nsustainable  urban  development  through  sound  environmental  management,  social \ndevelopment, and good governance. \n \n6.  In  its  fight  against  poverty  in  the  Region,  ADB  has  embraced  the  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, which aim to halve by 2015 the proportion of people living in extreme \npoverty  and  without  access  to  reliable  and  safe  drinking  water,  and  to  achieve  by  2020 \nsignificant improvements in the lives of at least 100 million slum dwellers. Urban development \ninitiatives that follow CA approaches, particularly the CDS and CWS techniques, will make a \nsignificant contribution to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. \n \n7.  CA membership makes it easier for ADB to sponsor and facilitate CDS and CWS \ninitiatives  in  developing  member  countries  (DMCs).  CDS  and  CWS  are  locally  owned, \nstrategically-focused,  participatory  planning  processes  that  enable  city  stakeholders  to \ncollaborate in a collective vision for economic and social development, slum eradication, and \nimproved  governance  for  their  city.  The  processes  encourage  city  stakeholders  to  pool \nresources and experience to generate new tools and practical approaches for equitable city \ndevelopment. The CDS should guide the development of a city and contain time bound and \nspecify action plans, investment plans, and financing strategies. The CWS should be integrated \nwith the CDS and set within the context of citywide poverty reduction programs. CDS and CWS \nprograms should center on participatory planning. ADB should help partner cities to develop \nproposals and apply to CA for cofinance grants. \n \n8.  ADB's  urban  development  portfolio  mostly  finances  integrated  urban  development \nprojects, including (i) municipal infrastructure, slum upgrading, environmental sanitation, roads, \nbridges,  drainage,  flood  control,  and  solid  waste  management;  and  (ii)  single  component \nprojects, like urban water supply, wastewater management, and housing finance. ADB's urban \nsector projects are underpinned by policy dialogue on urban governance and management and \nTA to develop capability and capacity for sustainable and efficient urban management and \ndelivery of services. This nonlending support increasingly focuses on good city governance, \neconomic price setting, affordability and cost recovery for services, and strengthening of the \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 1999. Urban Sector Strategy, Manila. ", "    3 \ncapability and capacity of local governments in an increasingly decentralized environment. \nADB's TA also helps test and demonstrate how to directly improve and secure the lives of \ndisadvantaged and vulnerable urban residents. These programs affirm ADB as a pioneer and \nleader in helping the urban poor gain access to services and develop their communities. The \nprogram could be considerably strengthened with support from CA. Synergies and resources \navailable through CA are necessary to continue this work. \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Outputs \n9.  The  goal  of  the  regional  TA7  is  to  improve  the  quality, development impact and \nsustainability of urban investments in the region by harnessing the knowledge, techniques and \nresources of CA. \n \n10.  The TA will (i) facilitate ADB\u2019s continued membership in CA, (ii) engage partner cities \nmore proactively with CA, (iii) consolidate ADB\u2019s participation in CA, and (iv) provide a platform \nfor coordinated advocacy activities in support of ADB\u2019s urban development initiatives throughout \nthe region. \n \n11.  The  principal  outputs  will  be  (i)  the  advocacy  and  promotion  of  CDS  and  CWS \napproaches as key tools for reducing urban poverty among DMCs and partner cities throughout \nthe Region; (ii) facilitation of applications to CA for grants to assist with project identification, \npreparation, and capacity building in support of the urban sector operations program; and \n(iii) increased levels of awareness among stakeholders about ADB\u2019s role in alleviating urban \npoverty in the Region. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  Through the TA, the minimum contribution to the CA ADB Trust Fund will be made to \nmaintain ADB's membership for 1 year. An advocacy strategy will be developed to promote \nADB\u2019s urban activities and leverage resources. The advocacy strategy will aim to produce and \ndisseminate  high-impact  urban  knowledge  products.  This  will  be  achieved  through  close \ncoordination  among  concerned  departments  and  offices  to  ensure  that  ABD\u2019s  urban \ndevelopment activities are appropriately documented, featured, and highlighted in publications, \nin multimedia projects, and at key meetings, conferences, and events. The advocacy strategy \nwill also seek access to external promotional resources, facilities, and tools such as CA and \nother web sites, publications, and participation in international conferences and seminars on \nurban development. Closer engagement and coordination on urban affairs will be sought with \nkey external partners like the multilateral development banks and major bilateral agencies.  \n \n13.  The  CDS  and  CWS  concepts  and  techniques  for  poverty  reduction  will  be  widely \npromoted  among  DMCs  and  partner  cities  through  regional  seminars  and  workshops, \ndissemination  of  the  final  report  from  TA  6026,  and  the  planned  knowledge  management \napplications  portal  being  established  for  the  Urban  Development  Municipal  Services  and \nHousing Committee (Urban Sector Committee). The portal is expected to be operational during \nthe first quarter of 2004 and will be managed and maintained by Agriculture, Natural Resources \nand Social Sectors Division of the Regional and Sustainable Development Department. The \n                                                 \n7  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 13 December 2002. ", "4 \nportal will be the main source for ADB's urban knowledge, including project profiles, project \nsummaries,  good  practices,  lessons  learned,  and  links  to  other  web  sites  like \nhttp://www.citiesalliance.org. \n \n14.  Consultations between the Urban Sector Committee and regional departments indicate \nsubstantial demand for CA support, particularly for CDS and CWS. Applications to CA for about \n4\u20136 trust fund grants8 are expected from the regional departments. Projects in India, Indonesia, \nKazakhstan,  and  Philippines  and  DMCs  in  the  Pacific  have  been  identified  as  potential \ncandidates. The grants will be used to assist with project identification and preparation activities, \nand for advocacy and capacity building. The TA will support the regional departments and \nfacilitate the preparation of applications for CA grants in conjunction with the urban sector \noperations program.  \n \n15.  In close consultation  with the regional departments, the TA will assess the benefits \narising from CA membership and develop a strategy for sustaining ADB\u2019s participation. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $350,000 equivalent. ADB will provide $350,000 equivalent \nto cover the entire TA cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding \nprogram. Detailed cost estimates and the financing plan for the TA are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  ADB  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  by \nAgriculture, Natural Resources and Social Sectors Division of the Regional and Sustainable \nDevelopment Department and the team will work closely with concerned ADB departments and \noffices to prepare the advocacy strategy, promote CDS and CWS approaches, identify partner \ncities, disseminate knowledge, and facilitate applications for CA grants. ADB will engage a \ndomestic urban development specialist for 8 person-months to provide overall technical support \nfor the  management and implementation of the TA activities. The TA will also engage an \nadministrative  support  staff  person  for  8  person-months  and  a  web  developer  for \n3 person-months. Regional consultative workshops will be arranged to brief partner cities on \nCDS and CWS techniques, and the procedure for applying for grants and to engage with \nmultilateral and bilateral development partners. TA outputs will be posted on the portal. \n \n18.  ADB will select and engage the consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  on  the  selection  and \nengagement of domestic consultants. The consultants' outline terms of reference are given in \nAppendix 3. The TA will be implemented over 12 months from January to December 2004. \n \n19.  The ADB contribution to CA for 2003\u20132004, in the amount of $250,000, will be deposited \nin the CA-ADB Trust Fund in accordance with the memorandum of agreement signed in March \n2003. The trust fund contribution entitles ADB to partnership status in CA for 1 year, and is the \n                                                 \n8  World  Bank  uses  the  CDS  process  as  an  agile  planning  instrument  that  identifies  and  packages  viable \ninvestments. World Bank\u2019s East Asia urban sector unit credits CDS work in the People\u2019s Republic of China with \ndoubling its urban development lending in the last 2 years in that country.  World Bank sponsors large multicity \nCDS  programs  in  Indonesia  and  the  Philippines  specifically  for  follow-on  investment  projects.  The \nUnited Kingdom\u2019s Department for International Development (DFID) and Deutsch Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische \nZusammenarbeit (GTZ \u2013 German Agency for Technical Cooperation) routinely integrate CDS and CWS programs \ninto their development operations, including in Asia. ", "    5 \nminimum required annual contribution. The balance of TA funds will be used for the other \nactivities (paras. 12-15). CA partner status entitles ADB to membership in the CA Consultative \nGroup, which is responsible for developing CA\u2019s long-term strategy and approving its annual \nwork program. This is an important forum for ADB to highlight its leadership role for urban \ndevelopment  in  the  Region.  The  group  meets  annually,  usually  in  October.  ADB  was \nrepresented at the 2002 and 2003 meetings, and will send a representative to the 2004 group \nmeeting.    \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $350,000 on a grant basis for \nADB\u2019s Participation in the Cities Alliance, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n ", " \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n6\n \nDesign Summary  Indicators and Targets  Monitoring Mechanisms  Assumptions/Risks \nA\n        p\np\nGoal        e\nn\n        d\nix\nTo improve the quality,  The urban development initiatives  Global Urban Observatory.
