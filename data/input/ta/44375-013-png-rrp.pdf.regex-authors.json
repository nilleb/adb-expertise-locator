", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto Papua New Guinea (PNG) for the Maritime and Waterways Safety Project.1 \n \n2.  The project will improve the safety and efficiency of national and international shipping in \ncoastal areas and waterways in PNG by replacing, installing, and maintaining navigational aids \n(navaids);2 improving the maritime safety information infrastructure; improving the maritime \nsafety  practice  of  communities;  and  providing  efficient  project  management  and  capacity \ndevelopment.3   \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  With over 600 islands spanning a total sea area of over 3.1 million square kilometers, \nPNG  relies  heavily  on  its  network  of  coastal  shipping  services.  The  reliance  of  coastal \ncommunities on shipping services is amplified by the country\u2019s limited land-based transport \nnetwork.  It  is  not  possible  to  travel  by  land  between  most  provinces,  and  most  of  the \n6,500 kilometers of coastline in the country\u2019s maritime provinces are accessible only by sea. \nFurther, for many coastal communities, the development of land-based transport links is not \nfeasible because of remoteness, rugged or inaccessible terrain, and high cost.  \n \n4.  The safety and efficiency of PNG\u2019s coastal transport infrastructure directly affects the \naccess of coastal communities to economic opportunities and key public services such as \neducation and health facilities, and thus has a significant impact on the inclusiveness of PNG\u2019s \ncontinuing high rates of economic growth.4 The PNG National Household Survey of 1996 shows \nthat 65% of the country\u2019s poor live in the coastal regions of Momase, Islands, and Central \nprovinces.5 PNG\u2019s maritime transport system plays an integral part in PNG\u2019s transport sector \nand facilitates social and economic connectivity, linking to road and aviation transport networks.  \n \n5.  PNG\u2019s  coastal  transport  infrastructure  also  has  a  significant  role  in  supporting  the \nefficiency of regional shipping services. In 2010, there were about 3,100 international voyages \nbetween PNG, the Australian east coast ports, and Asian ports in the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina, Japan, and the Republic of Korea. The number was about half of total sea voyages in \nPNG.6 Although the vessels on major routes usually carry radar and a global positioning \nsystem, there are safety risks of straying outside key passages and channels that require \nreliance on local knowledge augmented navaids due to high traffic volume and groups of atolls. \n \n6.  To  establish  a  safe  and  efficient  maritime  transport  environment  for  international, \nregional, and national traffic, it is necessary to continue to improve the network of navaids in the \ncountry. Navaids reduce risks such as groundings and blockage of channels that can cause \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   Includes hazard markers and channel markers. \n3  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance.

Childhood \nstunting, a key indicator of nutritional status and poverty, was estimated to be as high as 40.1% of the population in \nthe rural areas of PNG\u2019s island provinces in 2010. This effect is particularly pronounced for females, with 43.4% of \ngirls suffering from stunting.  \n5  ADB. 2012. Papua New Guinea: Critical Development Constraints.

", "2 \nserious injury and loss of life, physical damage to coastal reefs, and environmental damage \nfrom pollution through loss of fuel oil or cargo in the case of bulk carriers. Navaids also allow \nshipping operators to take safe and economic shipping routes by recognizing hazards along \nroutes, thus increasing the efficiency of transport services.    \n   \n7.  Prior to the involvement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in the maritime sector, \nmany of the country\u2019s navaids had deteriorated because of insufficient maintenance, weather \ndamage, volcanic damage, and theft. The ADB-funded Rehabilitation of the Maritime Navigation \nAids System Project improved the maritime transport environment by repairing, upgrading, or \nconstructing 211 navaids as public assets along mainly international shipping routes by March \n2008.7 \n \n8.  By late 2005, the previous project had also contributed to establishing the National \nMaritime Safety Authority (NMSA) as the agency responsible for navaids maintenance and \noperation. Under NMSA\u2019s community engagement program, community lighthouse committees \n(CLCs) have been established at all navaid sites to monitor lights, provide security, and conduct \nbasic maintenance using community land lease fees and maintenance funding provided by \nNMSA. The program contributes to reducing theft and increasing community ownership of \nnavaids by providing socially centered activities for community welfare and income generation, \nas well as gender equity.8 The operational status of the navaids provided by the previous project \nis generally good. \n \n9.  To build on the successes of the previous project, NMSA seeks to scale up its network \nof  navaids,  increase  the  coverage  of  safety  information,  and  replicate  the  success  of  the \ncommunity engagement program in remote and rural communities. It has identified the need for \n99  navaid  replacements  as  well  as  33  new  navaid  installations  along  PNG\u2019s  coastlines. \nAdditional navaids will help shipping operators guide their vessels through PNG\u2019s system of \nwaterways. NMSA has also identified the need for an improved traffic control, monitoring and \nsurveillance system; tide gauges; and wider coverage of hydrographic charts to reduce the risks \ndescribed in para. 6 and contain the costs of shipping services as traffic volume increases.9 To \noperate the new systems and expand the coverage of the charts, it is necessary for NMSA to \nupgrade technical and management skills for more rigorous and quantitative monitoring.    \n \n10.  By improving the environment for safe and economic maritime transport, the proposed \nproject will produce benefits for rural and remote populations, the wider national population, and \nregional stakeholders in the PNG maritime transport sector. Coastal shipping will be safer and \nmore efficient, risks will be lowered, and vessel accidents and losses will decrease. Passenger \ncapacity will increase, and delivery of goods and services to coastal communities that depend \non  maritime transport will  improve,  because  of  safer  and  potentially  more frequent  vessel \nservices. The project will have significant benefits for the 65% of PNG\u2019s poor who live in coastal \nregions through improved passenger and cargo services; easier access to health, education, \nand other services; and direct support to communities in cash and services provided by the \nproject. In addition, the project will benefit international and regional transport services because \n                                                \n7 ADB. 2000. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to Papua New \nGuinea for the Rehabilitation of the Maritime Navigation Aids System Project. Manila. \n8 Community awareness programs focusing on small boat safety and the importance of navaids structures were \nprovided. Also, 20% of the maintenance fees paid to each committee were dedicated to funding activities of \nwomen\u2019s groups.  \n9 The risk of accidents increased as statistics show 48% increase of traffic volume from 4.68 million tons in 1998 to \n6.94 million tons in 2010 in terms of cargo throughput. On 3 February 2012, MV Rabaul Queen sank off east coast \nand 246 people were rescued while more than 110 people were missing.  \n ", "3 \nof the improved navaids network, better maritime safety information and hydrographic charts, \nand  more  effective  search  and rescue  capacity  with  improved monitoring  and  surveillance \nsystems.  \n \n11.  The proposed project will support the government\u2019s Development Strategic Plan 2010\u2013\n2030,10 and National Transport Strategy to be launched in early 2013 (footnote 6), both of which \nidentify  the  improvement  of  existing maritime and  waterways  transport  infrastructure,  as  a \nnational priority. Further, the project is consistent with the strategic priority of the transport \nsector in ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy 2011\u20132015.11 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The  impact  will  be  safer  and  enhanced  access  to  socioeconomic  opportunities  by \ncommunities in PNG and regional and international stakeholders. The project is expected to \nproduce benefits for rural and remote populations as well as the national and international \npopulations.  The  outcome  will  be  an  environment  for  safe  and  economic  shipping  routes \nprovided by NMSA. \n \nC.  Outputs \n13.  Outputs  include (i) replaced,  installed,  and maintained  navaids;  (ii)  improved  safety \ninformation  infrastructure;  (iii)  improved  maritime  safety  practice  of  communities;  and \n(iv) efficient project management and capacity development. \n \n14.  Output  1:  Replaced,  installed,  and  maintained  navaids.  NMSA  will  replace \n99 existing navaids and install 33 additional navaids. These are outlined in NMSA\u2019s work plan \nwith site selection criteria in the project administration manual (PAM).12 To determine priorities, \nthe plan uses engineering aspects, including relationships with PNG\u2019s existing navaids network, \nship traffic density, and environmental conditions. The proposed project will conduct a feasibility \nstudy  that  includes  investigation  of  the  navaids\u2019  local  environment  and  due  diligence \nassessments. Where a need is identified, engineering design will incorporate measures for \nadapting to climate change impacts to ensure sustainable maintenance.13 The project will help \nNMSA  establish  a  sustainable  maintenance  scheme  and  conduct  periodic  maintenance  of \nreplaced  and  installed  navaids  based  on  the  scheme.  Communities  will  participate  in  a \ncommunity engagement program to monitor and secure good condition of navaids based on the \npractice of the previous project (footnote 7). \n \n15.  Output 2: Improved safety information infrastructure. NMSA will contract out a large-\nscale hydrographic survey and provide survey data to the Australian Hydrographic Service14 to \nproduce  nautical  charts  and  electronic  navigational  charts  for  seven  ports,  and  recompile \nexisting PNG navigational chart portfolios.15 NMSA will also extend the automatic identification \nsystem (AIS) network by installing AIS transponders and base stations in at least five sites and \nrelocating three existing stations. The project will confirm the details and configuration of each \nsite prior to commencement of works. Tide gauges will also be installed in four major ports to \nmeasure changes in sea level and contribute to the growing database of climate change and \n                                                \n10 Government of PNG. 2010.

Output 3: Improved maritime safety practice of communities. NMSA will provide \nmaritime safety awareness activities for the public and in targeted rural and remote communities \nto change people\u2019s perceptions of maritime safety and improve small craft safety practices. The \nactivities will include a well-planned media campaign and production of high-quality information \nmaterials aimed at different audiences (e.g., children and adults). Small craft safety training \nactivities and materials for women will be designed with advice from the NMSA Women in \nMaritime Association. \n \n17.  Output 4: Efficient project management and capacity development. The project will \nhelp NMSA establish a project implementation unit (PIU) to implement and manage all activities \nfunded by the project. The PIU will be staffed by NMSA personnel and new recruits if necessary, \nand supplemented by consultants to support the PIU and to provide required expertise to \nproduce  outputs  described  above.  The  project  will  also  undertake  a  range  of  capacity \ndevelopment  initiatives  for  personnel  through  coaching  and  on-the-job  training,  such  as \noperating new safety and hydrographic information infrastructure in NMSA.   \n \nD.

The  financing  plan  is  in  Table  2.  The  ADB  loan  will  cover  recurrent  costs  for \nmaintenance of navaids, AIS, and tide gauges to be installed under outputs 1 and 2. After \ncompletion of the project, NMSA will cover the recurrent costs using additional revenue to be \ngenerated by improved revenue collection efficiency (para. 30). Interest during implementation \nwill be financed by the ADB loan. Transportation and insurance costs may also be financed by \nthe ADB loan.     \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \nAmount  Share of \nSource  ($ million)    Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank  41.50    85.81 \nGovernment  6.86    14.19 \n  Total    48.36    100.00 \nSources: Government of Papua New Guinea and Asian Development \nBank estimates.  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n21.  The  executing  agency  will  be  NMSA,  which  will  oversee  implementation  and \nperformance of the project. A project steering committee will be formed and chaired by NMSA to \noversee and monitor project implementation, including policy and coordination, technical design \nand tendering, progress reports, and audited accounts.  \n \n22.  The PIU will be established in NMSA to oversee design and day-to-day implementation, \nfinancial  management,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation.  To  complement  the  PIU\u2019s  limited \ntechnical staff resources, consultants will be retained for these services, in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time).

DUE DILIGENCE \n25.  Due diligence is based on extensive consultations with potential beneficiaries in rural \nand urban areas, as well as broad stakeholder consultations with the government, civil society, \nnongovernment organizations, other development partners, and the private sector.  \n \nA.  Technical \n26.  Analyses for potential civil works include project site selection for navaids, engineering \nand cost estimates for navaids design and installation, and safety information infrastructure. \nTwo types of navaid will be provided: (i) monopile type, in which either a light or a marker is set \natop a steel pipe driven into the seabed; and (ii) floating buoy type, in which either a light or a \nmarker is set atop a floating buoy structure that is attached to an anchor moored on the sea \nfloor by a chain. Both types would be protected from corrosion and have a design life of at least \n20 years. Where a need is identified, designs will incorporate measures for adapting to climate \nchange impacts to ensure sustainable maintenance (footnote 13). \n  \n ", "7 \n27.  NMSA investigated various possible sites for future expansion of the AIS network with \nthe assistance of its contractor and by means of radio simulations. Currently, five antenna sites \nare earmarked for additional base stations, while three existing antenna stations shall be moved \nto better locations in the areas. For the tide gauge network installment, NMSA has decided this \nshould be based on radar tide gauge recorders and sensors with data acquisition systems. \nThese will be linked via a mobile or landline network to a central Tide Gauge Center at NMSA \nHeadquarters in Port Moresby for reception of real-time data of sea level variations. While \nseven to eight stations were considered necessary to cover the whole archipelago, only three \nfacilities were commissioned in the previous project. Project preparatory technical assistance \nverified NMSA\u2019s information infrastructure plan. \n \n28.  NMSA selected seven ports based on traffic volume and tourism activities to conduct \nhydrographic surveys. The survey collects data in digital format required to meet International \nHydrographic Organization standards. The data are to be given to the Australian Hydrographic \nService for production of paper charts and electronic navigational charts under a partnership \nwith Australia.   \n  \nB.  Economic and Financial \n29.  The project is viable from an economic perspective, according to the economic analysis \ncarried out on the proposed replacement of 99 existing navaids and construction of 33 new \nnavaids. The proposed installations were estimated to yield an economic internal rate of return \nof 14.7%. The sensitivity analysis also found results to be robust, exceeding 12% under a \nnumber of scenarios.17  \n \n30.  In accordance with ADB\u2019s Financial Management and Analysis of Projects guidelines,  \nan assessment was undertaken of the financial sustainability of the project.18 NMSA will need to \nimprove  its  revenue  collection  efficiency,  particularly  on  navaids,  to  cover  the  increased \nrecurrent cost for the maintenance of navaids. Since navaids levies form the majority of NMSA \nrevenues, it is imperative that NMSA improve its revenue collection efficiency under the NMSA \nAct, 2003. NMSA will also need to review its current tariff policy to determine if there is a need \nto increase tariff rates further or change the basis of tariffs. In addition, NMSA will have to \nstrengthen  its  enforcement  capability  to  increase  domestic  vessel  registration.  Although \nmaintenance costs will be covered by the ADB loan during the project, with the project\u2019s support, \nNMSA will establish a mechanism to ensure maintenance financing after the project completion \nby improving the collection of navaids levies  through addressing the issues of tariff rates, \npayment collection, and registration by the end of 2018 as described in the loan agreement.19   \n \nC.  Governance  \n31.  Financial management. A financial management assessment was completed for NMSA, \nincluding  a  review  of  the  accounting  and  reporting  system,  internal  and  external  auditing \npractices, fund disbursement, and information systems. The risks associated with NMSA are \nassessed to be medium and relate to project management and revenue collection efficiency. \nNMSA has not been involved in the management of ADB-funded loan projects and will require \ntraining on ADB procedures to ensure that project funds are managed in accordance with ADB \npolicy.  \n                                                \n17 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18 ADB. 2005.

A procurement capacity assessment20 was completed for NMSA and \nindicated that procurement capacity within NMSA remains weak. A procurement specialist will \nassist NMSA in procuring goods, works, and consulting services.   \n \n33.  Anticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  NMSA.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 12). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n34.  Benefits. The project is expected to generate widespread social and economic benefits \namong  rural  coastal  communities.  Direct  benefits  from  the  navaids  improvements  include \nimproved quality of life of the communities through improved safety for small passenger craft, \nsafer access to health and education services and markets, as well as access to training in HIV \nprevention. Navaid lights will enable safer fishing at night and when out of sight of land, thus \npotentially  increasing  catches  and  rural  incomes.  In  addition,  CLCs  will  be  established  to \nmonitor lights and provide security, for which service an annual fee will be provided by NMSA. \nThe CLC agreement stipulates that this must be used for small development projects, which \nmitigate poverty or improve conditions for women and girls.  \n \n35.  Gender. The project is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. A gender action \nplan has been prepared to guide implementation of the project. The key activities under the plan \ninclude (i) women\u2019s participation in community consultations regarding the design, location, and \nmaintenance of navaids; (ii) a land investigation process incorporating the recognition of women \nmembers of landowning groups and protection of their land inheritance rights; (iii) inclusion of \nwomen in the CLCs with a 40% target and earmarking at least 20% of CLC payments for \nwomen\u2019s and girls\u2019 activities; (iv) involvement of both men and women in safety awareness \ntraining;  and  (v) capacity  development  of  NMSA  and  the  PIU  on  gender  awareness  and \ninstitutional strengthening plans. NMSA agreed to adopt the plan for the project\u2019s community \nengagement and training components. \n  \nE.  Safeguards \n36.  Impacts on the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples were \nassessed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).  \n \n37.  Environment. Proposed navaid installations and rehabilitation works will not result in \nany  significant  adverse  environmental  impact.  All  potential  environmental  impacts  can  be \nadequately mitigated and managed, and will be monitored. An environmental assessment and \nreview framework has been prepared for the project and an initial environmental examination, \nincorporating an environmental management and monitoring plan, has been prepared for the \ntwo sites (covering up to eight installations).21 The assessment procedures comply with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement requirements. The project is classified category B for environment. \n \n38.  Land  acquisition  and resettlement. The project is expected to involve minor land \nacquisition but is unlikely to have displacement impacts, as most subprojects will be undertaken \nin the sea and within the existing locations. New installations are mainly sited in the sea, on \n                                                \n20 Procurement Capacity Assessment and Recommendations (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n21 Initial Environmental Examination and Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list \nof linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nrocky headlands, or on other uninhabited coastal or foreshore sites. If any subprojects or \nactivities involve minor land acquisition and resettlement impacts, resettlement plans will be \nprepared according to the project\u2019s resettlement framework.22 A resettlement plan for sample \nsubprojects has also been prepared.23 The project\u2019s involuntary resettlement classification is \ncategory B. \n \n39.  Indigenous peoples. Melanesians are the indigenous people of PNG and comprise the \nvast majority of its population. Disadvantaged and vulnerable groups exist in all parts of the \ncountry but are not defined by their ethnicity or tribal affiliation; rather, by their geographic \nlocation, education, and access to services. The project covers a wide geographic spread, and \nis not expected to have adverse impacts on or target any particular group. While a separate \nindigenous peoples\u2019 planning framework and plan are not needed or appropriate for the project, \nall subprojects will be implemented in a culturally appropriate and participatory manner. The \nproject will implement a stakeholder consultation and participation strategy and a community \nengagement program to mobilize local communities in providing security and monitoring of \ninfrastructure. Agreements with communities regarding use of local customary land or foreshore \nfor subprojects, if needed, will be included in the resettlement planning documents for relevant \nsubprojects. The project\u2019s classification is category C on indigenous peoples. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n40.

The government, NMSA, ADB, and \nnavaids  development partners will discuss and seek an opportunity to implement consultants\u2019 \nrecommendations. NMSA is committed to retain the required budget for operation \nand maintenance of the project navaids.   \nDelayed  Landowners will be consulted during pre-site condition surveys to ensure support \ncommencement  exists for navaids rehabilitation, installment, and maintenance. The PIU will confirm \nof civil works  landownership at subproject sites and facilitate an agreement with landowners for \ncaused by lack of  use of land at navaids sites prior to the award of civil works contracts. NMSA will \nagreement with  resolve any outstanding past occupancy fee for proposed navaid sites before \n                                                \n22 Resettlement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nlandowners  subproject selection.  \nClimate change  The PIU will design navaids while considering possible climate change risks, such as \nsea level rise and an increase in the intensity of severe events.   \nADB = Asian Development Bank, NMSA = National Maritime Safety Authority, navaid = navigational aid, PIU = project \nimplementation unit. \nSources: Asian Development Bank and project preparatory technical assistance consultants.  \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n41.
