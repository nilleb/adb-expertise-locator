The global scientific consensus is that climate change is increasing the intensity and \nfrequency  of  extreme  weather  events  such  as  tropical  cyclones  and  droughts,  and  is \naccelerating the melting of glaciers, causing sea level to rise. Drought will lead to a higher \nfrequency of forest fires, stresses on crop production and aquaculture, and higher incidence of \nheat-related and infectious diseases.1 The Stern Review Report on the Economics of Climate \nChange  estimates  that  even  if  atmospheric  carbon  dioxide  concentrations  are  kept  below \ndangerous levels through concerted international action, adaptation will still cost poor countries \n$10 billion annually just for the necessary infrastructure.2 If not addressed, the situation will \nseverely hinder long-term global and regional efforts to create a more healthy, prosperous, and \nsustainable  world.  While  the  emerging  responses  to  climate  change  focus  primarily  on \nmitigating the emissions of greenhouse gases, these threats to development progress show that \nthere also is a need to adapt to the anticipated impacts.3 The international community, such as \nthe  Intergovernmental  Panel  for  Climate  Change  (IPCC),  Organization  for  Economic \nCooperation and Development (OECD), and the Group of Eight (G8), has called for immediate \nmeasures to significantly reduce and stabilize the concentrations of greenhouse gases in the \natmosphere.  While there have been parallel calls for attention to climate change adaptation \n(e.g., United Nations Framework on the Conventions for Climate Change [UNFCCC], IPCC, G8), \nwork in this area is less advanced than mitigation efforts. \n \n2.  ADB\u2019s  main  contribution  to  a  climate  change  response  is  through  support  for  the \ntransition toward a low-carbon economy in Asia and the Pacific. Current activities support both \npublic and private investments in the fields of renewable and clean energy, energy efficiency, \nuse of carbon markets, and establishment of knowledge hubs. The Energy Efficiency Initiative4 \naims  to  bring  investment  in  clean  energy  to  at  least  $1  billion  per  year.  Other  support \nmechanisms include the Carbon  Market Initiative and  Clean Energy Financing Partnership \nFacility5 to catalyze greater investments in clean energy. In addition, ADB supports a few \ncenters of excellence that aim to collect, enrich, and disseminate knowledge on climate change, \nrenewable energy, and efficient resource use through its Regional Assistance for Establishment \nof Regional Knowledge Hubs. \n \n3.  While mitigation efforts are essential, work must begin on building understanding of the \nlikely impacts of climate change and moving forward with the most cost-effective adaptation \nmeasures.  Unfortunately, the majority of ADB\u2019s developing member countries (DMCs) are not \nyet adequately prepared to deal with the changes already predicted based on current trends.   \n \n4.  This technical assistance6 (TA) is formulated to strengthen adaptation responses in the \nAsia and Pacific region so that DMCs will be more resilient to climate change. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1  See http://www.ipcc.ch/pub/sr97.htm for information on Asian climate change vulnerabilities.  \n2   Stern, N. 2006. Stern Review: The Economics of Climate Change. (pages 471\u2013507).  \n3  Mitigation  refers  to  interventions  meant  to  reduce  the  emissions  of  greenhouse  gases  or  enhance  their \nsequestration/sinks. Adaptation refers to adjustments made based on the expected impacts of climate change to \nreduce costs and vulnerabilities. \n4  ADB. 2007.

Rapid climate changes are expected to create a range of adverse impacts in Asia and \nthe Pacific. From the Himalayan highlands to the rich tropical forests of Southeast Asia and \nacross the Pacific Islands, many natural ecosystems are vulnerable to climate change and \nsome will be irreversibly damaged. As noted, these vulnerabilities derive from increased risks \nbrought about by climate change.7    \n \n6.  It is reasonable to conclude that climate change poses a new and significant threat to \nachieving  both  poverty  reduction  and  economic  growth  in  many  DMCs.  There  is  a  high \nprobability that the least-developed countries (LDCs) and people who already are the most \nvulnerable will be disproportionately affected (footnote 2).  The ability to which DMCs can adapt \nto climate change will be instrumental in their fight to reduce poverty and promote sustained \neconomic development. \n \n7.  Three issues need to be addressed to strengthen adaptation responses in Asia and the \nPacific. First, the future environmental conditions in vulnerable Asia-Pacific ecosystems need to \nbe  better  known.  For  climate  change  adaptation  to  be  mainstreamed  in  the  development \nprocess, the impacts of climate change must be identified and analyzed in terms of broader, \nnational-level  economic  impacts.  For  mainstreaming  to  be  effective,  a  broad  range  of \ngovernment departments and ministries will need to be targeted, e.g., economic and finance \nministries as well as ministries dealing with the environment, water resources, agriculture, etc. \nUpgrading the capacity of key technocrats is a critical step in ensuring that policy reformers \nhave internal trustworthy research sources to rely on. And policy reformers will also require \ncapacity building so as to know how to critically review the research of technocrats. Second, \nDMCs need assistance to strengthen their existing adaptation plans.  While the work on early \nadaptation plans in LDCs drew significant lessons, it is clear that further technical assistance will \ngreatly improve LDCs\u2019 ability to prepare investment plans and development policies that will be \nmore compatible with future climatic conditions. Some more developed DMCs with large human \npopulations are also liable to suffer significant impacts from climate change and might require \nassistance  with  adaptation  planning.  Third,  the  international  community  needs  to  be  more \nresponsive to DMCs\u2019 changing needs. Both the procedures and priorities for investment may \nneed  to  be  re-engineered  to  account  for  changing  climatic  conditions.  At  ADB,  country \npartnership strategies (CPS), sector investments, and internal bank policies all need to be able \nto respond to DMCs needs for adapting to climate change.   \n \n8.  ADB is well-poised to support climate adaptation in Asia and the Pacific because (i) it \nhas a strong mandate to promote climate change initiatives through its Clean Energy and \nEnvironment Program; (ii) it is cultivating experience with climate change adaptation8 and it \nintends to broaden and deepen that experience in the coming years; (iii) it enjoys productive \nrelations with leaders in climate change such as UNFCCC, and United Nations Environment \nProgramme  (UNEP)  and  its  subregional  partners,9 as  well  as  Global  Environment  Facility \n(GEF)-financed initiatives; and (iv) perhaps, more importantly, it can help DMCs apply the \nscience  of  adaptation  to  investment  planning  and  policy  development.  This  is  seen  as  a \n                                                 \n7  E.g., UNEP predicted that a 1.5-meter sea level rise in Bangladesh will flood about 16% of the country\u2019s area \nwhere 15% (22 million people) of the nation currently live. See http://www.grida.no/climate/vital/33.htm \n8  Several subregions have initiated adaptation activities through ADB financing.  For example, the Climate Change \nAdaptation Program for the Pacific has assisted Pacific DMCs to enhance their adaptive capacities and resilience \nto climate change variability, including changes in extreme events and sea level rise. This is achieved by risk \nassessment, planning and policy development, and \u201cclimate-proofing\u201d infrastructure and communities. \n9  UNEP  subregional  partners  include  SPREP=Secretariat  of  the  Pacific  Regional  Environment  Program, \nASEAN=Association  of  Southeast  Asean  Nations,  SACEP,  MRC=Mekong  River  Commission, \nICIMOD=International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development, and NEASPEC=North East Asia Sub-regional \nProgram for Environment Cooperation. See http://www.roap.unep.org/region/subregion.cfm for more details. \n ", "  3\ncomparative advantage because much of the current work by others is limited to strengthening \nthe scientific basis for understanding adaptation, i.e., without planning applications.  \n \n9.  ADB\u2019s support to adaptation cannot occur in isolation. It must be coordinated with other \ninternational  organizations,  scientific  bodies,  and  aid  agencies  that  are  developing  parallel \nresponses to adaptation for ADB\u2019s DMCs. Though adaptation is generally considered to be \nunderresourced, support for it is rapidly increasing. This creates a coordination challenge and \nrisk of inefficient use of resources.  Adaptation initiatives are numerous and build upon the \nanalytical work of the IPCC, which was established to assess the scientific, technical, and \nsocioeconomic information relevant for understanding climate change, its potential impacts, and \noptions for adaptation and mitigation.10  Two adaptation funds have been set up by UNFCCC to \nstrengthen developing countries\u2019 adaptation responses: the Special Adaptation Fund, and the \nLeast-Developed Countries Fund, both of which are managed by GEF.  Arrangements for a new \nAdaptation  Fund  capitalized  through  a  2%  levy  on  clean  development  mechanism  (CDM) \ntransactions to finance concrete adaptation measures are currently being negotiated under \nUNFCCC. The United Kingdom, for example, recently approved a $1.6 billion International \nEnvironmental Transformation Fund for the purpose of reducing poverty through environmental \nmanagement and helping developing countries respond to climate change. The World Bank and \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation are in discussion with ADB to jointly support an \nassessment of the climate change adaptation costs for Asian coastal cities. Appendix 2 gives \npreliminary selection criteria and implementing arrangements for small grants activities (SGAs).   \n \n10.  National-level  adaptation  is  also  occurring.  Several  least-developed  country  LDC \nmembers have prepared National Adaptation Program for Action (NAPAs), and these may serve \nas a basis for adaptation investments.  Some non-LDC members, including India and the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), are undertaking activities in both adaptation research and \npolicy.  Nongovernment organizations (NGOs) and research institutes are also aligning activities \ntoward climate adaptation.   \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n11.  The TA is designed to help address (i) the need to mainstream adaptation issues into \ninvestment planning, (ii) the need to develop a national capacity for adaptation, and (iii) the \nneed to coordinate and strengthen international community responses for adaptation.   \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The TA\u2019s impact is the participating governments\u2019 adoption of investment programs, \nplans, policies and/or other actions to adapt development to expected future climatic conditions. \nAll those should be developed in close cooperation with DMCs and international organizations \n(e.g., UNFCCC, UNEP) so that the latter seamlessly support relevant existing adaptation plans \nand activities. It is assumed that climate change will continue to occur and that its effects can be \nmeasured and presented. The main risk to achieving this outcome is that Governments, and/or \nregional economic integration bodies do not endorse the TA\u2019s recommended policies/remedies.  \nThe TA\u2019s outcome is the improved understanding by participating governments of the necessary \nactions they must take to adapt to climate change.   \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n10 See http://www.ipcc.ch/SPM13apr07.pdf   for the most recent Working Group II report on adaptation. \n ", "4   \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n13.  The proposed TA comprises the following activities and outputs under three categories.   \n \n(i)  Strengthened regional and subregional cooperation. Selected subregional \norganizations  improve  their  capacity  to  support  adaptation  challenges  in \nvulnerable ecosystems, sectors, and/or peoples of selected DMCs. Examples of \nactivities and outputs that mainstream adaptation to investment planning will \ninclude subregional papers prepared to identify the current state and challenges \nin adaptation, a  framework for regional cooperation on adaptation to climate \nchange,  subregional-level  sector  studies  (e.g.,  in  agriculture,  coastal  zone \nmanagement, water resource management), and a review/revision of climate \nchange and adaptation scenarios for major ecosystems (e.g., low-lying coastal \nsystems, dryland ecosystems, mountain ecosystems, small island ecosystems).  \nActivities  and  outputs  will  be  conducted  in  cooperation  with  organizations \nproviding  relevant  support  for  climate  adaptation  (e.g.,  UNEP,  World \nMeteorological Organization).   \n(ii)  Strengthened  DMC  response  to  adaptation.  Selected  DMCs  revise  plans, \npolicies, and/or other actions to make them better adapted to future climatic \nconditions. Examples of capacity building and technical activities and outputs will \ninclude  a    review  and  analysis  of  country  access  to  basic  climate  change \ninformation systems, assessment of the economic impacts of climate change, \nimproving understanding and use of climate change information, developing in-\ncountry adaptation programs, developing policies for addressing climate change \nadaptation in major economic sectors, communications strategies for promoting \npolicy options and adaptation strategies, and technical assistance to make the \nscience of climate change accessible to decision makers so that they can adapt \nselected investment plans.  \n(iii)  Mainstreaming adaptation considerations at ADB. ADB operations become \nbetter aligned to meet selected DMC investment needs, given the risks from \nclimate change.  Examples of activities to coordinate and strengthen international \ncommunity  responses  include  the  integration  of  climate  change  adaptation \nconsiderations  into  ADB\u2019s  CPS  processes,  sector  investment  approaches, \nsafeguard  policies  and  guidelines,  and  Disaster  and  Emergency  Assistance \nPolicy.    \n \n14.  SGAs will be financed through TA funds to pilot-test, demonstrate, or further develop the \nclarity  of  the  TA\u2019s  outputs.    Activities  will  be  oriented  toward  demonstrating  cost-effective \nadaptation  measures  that  lead  to  expanded  investment  support  from  ADB.    Examples  of \nsituations where SGAs may be provided include (i) field-based testing of promising adaptation \nmeasures  that  hold  potential  for  widespread  replication,  (ii)  policy  or  institutional  reform \ninitiatives relating to adaptation, (iii) regional or subregional efforts to identify or disseminate \nbest practices, and (iv) efforts to build climate change adaptation considerations into ADB\u2019s \nregional or country programming.  A key financing selection criterion is that activity results must \nbe replicable through future DMC or ADB support. To help achieve this criterion, activities \nproposed for small grants will generally need to receive support from and be directly applicable \nto regional departments.   Appendix 2 gives more information on SGAs.  \n \n15.  A monitoring system to be established for the TA will cover activities, inputs, outputs, \noutcomes, and financial management.  An evaluation system will also be designed to assess \ndevelopment  impact.  The  climate  change  adaptation  focal  point  in  ADB\u2019s  Regional  and \nSustainable Development Department (RSDD) will be supported and exchange visits to similar \n ", "  5\ninitiatives of development partners will be undertaken to ensure coordination and to facilitate \njoint activities.  \n \n16.  The findings of the TA will be disseminated to regional, subregional, DMC, multilateral \ndevelopment bank, and bilateral development partners through publications, workshops, and \nthe internet. It is expected that the findings will allow partners to further their own adaptation \nefforts. In particular, the TA\u2019s support in preparing investment plans for DMCs is expected to \nhelp realize the overall project impact when development partners are able to support financing \nof projects proposed in the plans.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $3.6 million. The amount of $0.8 million will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan, and \n$2.8 million will be financed on a grant basis by the Government of the United Kingdom. The \ncost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  The TA will start by November 2007 and will be completed about 48 months later.  The \nTA will be executed by the Environment and Social Safeguards Division (RSES) of RSDD, in \ncoordination with its Energy, Transport, and Water Division (RSID). RSDD staff will interact \nfrequently with regional department staff to identify and implement operational support activities \nfor climate adaptation. Participating regional departments will use existing relations to influence \nand  direct  development  country  partnership  strategies.  Links  will  be  established  with  ADB \nknowledge hubs when appropriate.  \n \n19.  Government  and  nongovernment  organizations  will  be  eligible  to  apply  for  SGAs.  \nApplications will be reviewed and awarded by a committee chaired by RSDD and populated by \nrepresentative operational and regional departments. The regional and operational departments, \nthrough a designated activity officer, will be responsible for supervising and monitoring activities \nwith administrative and technical support provided by RSES. \n \n20.  Individual consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The consultants\u2019 terms of reference \nare in Appendix 4. Equipment will be limited to computers and communications devices. They \nwill be purchased and disposed of in accordance with ADB guidelines.  \n \n21.  Specific DMCs have not yet been selected for participation in the regional TA (RETA). \nHowever, any activity funded by this RETA will only start in a particular DMC after ADB has \nreceived a no-objection letter from the DMC regarding its inclusion in the RETA. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION AND DECISION \n \n22.  The President recommends that the Board approve ADB administering a portion of \ntechnical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $2,800,000 for Promoting Climate Change \nAdaptation in Asia and the Pacific, to be financed on a grant basis by the Government of the \nUnited  Kingdom.  If  the  Board  approves  ADB  administering  the  technical  assistance,  the \nPresident, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, will approve ADB providing the \nbalance of the technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000, for Promoting \nClimate Change Adaptation in Asia and the Pacific.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign Summary  Performance Targets /  Data Sources /   Assumptions \nIndicators  Reporting  and Risks \nMechanisms \nImpact      Assumption \nParticipating  At least 50% of  DMC and ADB  Climate change will \ngovernments adopt  participating governments  investment portfolios.  continue to occur and its \ninvestment programs,  will have investment    effects can be measured \nplans, policies, and/or  programs, plans, policies,    and presented. \nother actions to adapt  or other actions that are      \ndevelopment to  better adapted to climate  Risks \nexpected future climatic  change within 4 years of  Governments do not \nconditions.

Each annual work plan will be reviewed and commented on by the  \u2022 Pilot projects and/or \nProject\u2019s steering committee (chaired by RSDD and populated by selected  case studies \nmembers of operational and regional departments). The key activities to be   \ncovered within the annual work plans are as follows.  \n \n1.1  Conduct a scoping study (including consultation and workshops) to \ndetermine the state of cooperation in subregions (South Asia, Southeast \nAsia, Central and West Asia, East Asia, and Pacific). On the basis of the \nstudy, prepare one paper for each subregion and an overarching \nframework for subregional cooperation on adaptation to climate change. \nThis study will serve as the basis for focusing the geographic, policy, and \ntechnical orientation of the TA.   \n1.2  Based on results of the scoping study and the framework, SGAs can be \nused to \n(i)  conduct  subregional-level  sector  studies  in  cooperation  with \nselected ADB subregional partners,a UNFCCC, UNEP, World Bank, \nJBIC, WMO, and other relevant agencies.

Small grants will be provided for activities that help equip developing member countries \n(DMCs) with the tools and experience necessary to adapt to climate change.  Collectively, the \nactivities will be a highly strategic suite of interventions that will help clarify the framework for \nadaptation needs and opportunities in the Asia and Pacific region. They are expected to have \nmajor impacts through either their direct outputs or replication plans. \n  \n2.  The provision of small grants will be driven by the needs of regional departments and \nproject officers of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and well as ADB\u2019s DMCs.  Activities \nfinanced by small grants can be implemented in any of ADB\u2019s DMCs. Activities will generally be \noriented toward creating opportunities for expanded investment.   \n \n3.  ADB  regional  departments,  national  organizations,  nongovernment  organizations \n(NGOs), private organizations, and academic institutions will be eligible to receive small grants \nto conduct activities in DMCs.  \n \n4.  Applications  for  small  grants  will  be  reviewed  and  awarded  by  a  committee  of \nrepresentative operational and regional departments.  The committee will be chaired by ADB\u2019s \nRegional and Sustainable Development Department (RSDD).  \n \n5.  Eligibility criteria for small grants may include (i) overall contribution to improving climate \nadaptation  responses  in  Asia  and  Pacific;  (ii)  demonstrated  support  from  DMC  and  ADB \nregional departments, (iii) consistency with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) or its successor(s), \nand ADB\u2019s Clean Energy and Environment Program or its successor(s); (iv) technically strong \ndesign; and (v) replication potential.  Criteria for prioritizing may include a vulnerable ecosystem \nor people focus, a collaborative approach using partnerships, and investment potential. \n \n6.  Examples of activities that small grants may support include, but will not be limited to, (i) \nfield-based testing of TA knowledge products by local stakeholders, including NGOs, national \nand subregional partnerships, academic institutions, or consultancy firms; and (ii)  project team \nactivities  in  regional  departments  that  strengthen  core  operations  by  integrating  climate \nadaptation (e.g., through policy dialogue, country programming, portfolio risk assessments, and \nproject preparation and implementation).  \n \n7.   An activity financed through a small grant is generally expected to be implemented over \na period of 6 to 12 months. Activities should not duplicate, or substitute for, ongoing or pipelined \nactivities in the DMCs, but should be directly relevant to the \u201csector outcomes\u201d cited in the \ncountry partnership strategy and/or updates for the DMC. The type and duration of inputs for the \nactivity will be provided in the activity proposals to be submitted by the ADB departments \nconcerned during TA implementation. \n \n8.  About one third of the TA funds will go toward financing small grants for activities (SGAs).  \nIndividual SGAs will in most cases be limited to a maximum TA financing of $100,000.   \n \n9.
