INTRODUCTION \n1.  The policy and advisory technical assistance (TA) for the Secondary Education Sector \nDevelopment Project is included in the country operations business plan, 2011\u20132013. The Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) has been providing substantial assistance for the development of \nsecondary education, including two projects: (i) the Teaching Quality Improvement in Secondary \nEducation Project, which focuses on teacher strengthening; and (ii) the Secondary Education \nSector Development Project, which is helping the government to reform the sector.1 A project \npreparatory TA is currently preparing the second Teaching Quality Improvement Project.2 ADB \nis also assisting in improving and mainstreaming madrasah education.3 The commitment of the \nGovernment of Bangladesh to education remains high. A National Education Policy (NEP), \nwhich proposes significant reforms to increase quality, access, and equity in education, has \nbeen  approved  by  the  cabinet  and  is  expected  to  be  tabled  during  the  next  session  of \nParliament. Although the NEP sets out a vision, the implications of the proposed reforms for the \nsecondary  education  sector  and  the  subsequent  implementation  strategy  have  yet  to  be \nanalyzed and developed. The government has therefore requested the support of the ADB in \nanalyzing the implications of the NEP for secondary education and preparing an implementation \nstrategy. The TA was discussed and approved during a fact-finding mission in August 2010.4 \nThe government concurred with the impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, \ncost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference. The design and monitoring framework is \nin Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Bangladesh has made considerable progress in improving access to education at all \nlevels,  despite  various  challenges  including  natural  disasters.  Enrollment  in  secondary \neducation has improved; so have the transition, completion, and pass rates in examinations. \nDespite significant progress in access, quality and equity remain major challenges. Poor quality \nmanifests  itself  in  unacceptably  high  dropout  rates,  although  these  are  improving,  and  in \ndifficulties  encountered  by  secondary  education  graduates  in  finding  a  job  because  the \ncurriculum  has  only  limited  relevance  for  the  job  market.  Children  from  poor  families  and \ndisadvantaged groups do not have access to an education of acceptable quality, and have low \ncompletion rates and poor learning achievements.  \n \n3.  Importance  of  secondary  education.  Globally,  secondary  education  is  expanding \nrapidly and putting enormous pressure on governments to respond quickly. In Bangladesh, the \nsame thing is happening as more students are now graduating from primary education, which \nhas a total enrollment of over 16 million in 5 grades. In contrast, the total enrollment in 7 grades \nin secondary education is little more than 50% of primary enrollment. The gross enrollment in \nsecondary education is currently around 50% compared to over 100% at the primary level. This \npercentage for secondary education will rise fast, given the increasing numbers of primary \neducation graduates. Secondary education has a vital role to play in providing technical and \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2004.

Manila. \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 1 December 2010. \n ", "2   \nvocational education and training, and preparing students for tertiary education and the labor \nmarket. The core skills and knowledge, such as analytical skills, literacy, communication, team \nwork,  science,  math,  and  information  and  communication  technology  (ICT),  become  more \ncritical at this stage.  \n \n4.  Quality. Studies and analyses consistently show that poor quality of education remains \nthe biggest challenge in Bangladesh, although improvements have been noted in secondary \nexamination  results.  Factors  responsible  for  poor  quality  and  high  internal  inefficiency  are          \n(i) poor teaching quality at the classroom level; (ii) high student\u2013teacher ratios; (iii) low \u201ctime on \ntask\u201d;  (iv)  inadequate  teaching  and  learning  materials  and  other  school  facilities;  and                 \n(v) overcrowded classrooms. The education system's success will depend on improving learning \noutcomes, particularly of the most disadvantaged groups. The government's sustained support \nfor stipends has led to an expansion in enrollment, but targeting needs to continue to improve. \n \n5.  Access. As a result of its stipend policy, Bangladesh was one of the few developing \ncountries to achieve gender parity up to secondary education by 2005, but different challenges \nremain.  The  proportion  of  female  students  starts  declining  after  grade  9  and  increases \nsignificantly  at  the  higher  secondary  level.  Although  more  female  students  are  enrolled  in \nsecondary education, more male students complete secondary education. Enrollment in the \nscience stream is dominated by male students. \n \n6.  Financing. At around 2.0% of GDP in FY2010, public expenditure in education remains \nlow. Developing countries at a similar level of economic development invest much more in \neducation, for example, around 3.5% of GDP in India and Viet Nam. While the government has \nrecognized the need to increase investment in education, it is yet to be translated into the \nannual allocations.  \n \n7.  Management and organization. Primary education is from grades 1 to 5, secondary \nfrom grades 6 to 10, and higher secondary from grades 11 to 12. Secondary education is \noffered in general secondary education schools, post-primary madrasahs, and some technical \nschools.  Only  2%  of  the  secondary  schools  are  government  schools  and  98%  are \nnongovernment.  The  nongovernment  schools  receive  100%  salary  support  for  approved \nteachers. There are wide variations among the nongovernment schools, in terms of quality, \nequity, and access indicators. Secondary education is weakly linked to needs in the job market. \nOn average, government schools perform the best, followed by urban private, rural private, \nurban madrasah, and rural madrasah.5  \n \n8.  The Ministry of Education (MOE) is responsible for overseeing and administering about \n20,000 secondary schools and 3,150 colleges, 2,728 technical education and vocational training \ninstitutions,  and  9,215  post-primary  madrasahs.  The  Directorate  of  Secondary  and  Higher \nEducation  (DSHE)  is  responsible  for  all  secondary  schools.  The  Bangladesh  Madrasah \nEducation  Board  under  MOE  is  responsible  for  designing  curricula,  holding  examinations, \nregistering madrasahs, contracting out textbook production, and distributing textbooks. The \nDepartment of Technical Education and the Technical Education Board are responsible for \nmanaging technical secondary education. DSHE does not yet have an effective inspection and \nacademic supervision system. A major issue is how to improve the quality of madrasahs and to \nmainstream them. The Ministry of Primary and Mass Education (MOPME) is responsible for \nprimary education, but primary education in madrasahs or in secondary schools with a primary \nsection is under the purview of the MOE.  \n                                                 \n5  CAMPE. 2007.

Globally, effective schools are associated with good head teachers that provide the \nleadership and accountability needed to improve school governance. The introduction of school-\nbased  management  and  leadership  at  all  levels  is  part  of  the  decentralized  approach  in \nBangladesh.  Similarly,  school-based  planning  has  been  introduced  and  is  showing  good \npotential.  \n \n10.  National Education Policy. The government\u2019s commitment to education remains high. \nThe National Education Policy (NEP), which emphasizes holistic and balanced development of \nthe entire education sector, was approved by the cabinet on 31 May 2010 and is expected to be \ntabled for parliamentary approval in December. The NEP emphasizes the urgent need to enroll \nall  students  in  primary  education,  raise  the  literacy  level,  reduce  existing  disparities,  and \nimprove the quality of education with a focus on teacher quality, school level leadership, more \neffective teacher training in the classroom, increased resources, targeted improvements, and \nmonitoring of key results. The government's emphasis is on science and mathematics, English, \nand ICT. \n \n11.  The NEP has proposed a restructuring of school education: (i) the extension of primary \neducation from grades 1\u20135 to grades 1\u20138, with grades 9\u201312 at the secondary level; and (ii) the \nintegration of different types of primary and secondary schools into fewer types to reduce \ndisparities. The government has emphasized revision of the curriculum to make it more relevant \nto the emerging needs of a rapidly modernizing economy, to provide more relevant teaching and \nlearning materials, and to conduct examinations in grades 5, 8, 10, and 12 to ensure common \nlearning outcomes for all children. The government aims to ensure that all children complete \nprimary education, irrespective of their geographic, socioeconomic, ethnic, linguistic, gender, \nphysical, and mental condition, with acceptable learning outcomes. The government recognizes \nthe need to expand the secondary education system to provide better access for primary school \ngraduates. The government is also focusing on mainstreaming the madrasah system to ensure \nequitable learning outcomes for all.  \n \n12.  Need for an implementation strategy. The reforms planned in the NEP are expected \nto lead to major improvements in access, quality, equity, and relevance to the job market. \nAlthough the NEP has set out a vision, the actual implications of the reforms proposed in the \nNEP for the secondary education sector and its subsequent implementation strategy have yet to \nbe analyzed and developed. This implementation strategy will be developed on the basis of \nanalyses  of  the  institutional  implications  and  arrangements,  particularly  for  the  proposed \nrestructuring of secondary education, of the sequencing of priorities for technical reforms, and of \nthe financial and monitoring implications of the reforms.  \n \n13.  Moving to a sector-wide approach. The government intends to adopt a sector-wide \napproach (SWAP) in secondary education. A SWAP based on the vision set out in the NEP \nwould strengthen government ownership of the reforms. Moving towards a SWAP from the \ncurrent project-based approach would support the aim to reduce the current fragmentation. \nPrimary education reforms are supported by a SWAP, and since the NEP envisions close \ncollaboration between  primary and secondary, a similar approach for secondary education \nshould support implementation of the reforms. 6 Two major development partners (the World \nBank and ADB) support secondary education, and more development partners are interested in \ngiving their support. An agreed road map with indicative timeline towards a SWAP would \n                                                 \n6  ADB is lead development partner in the primary education SWAP consisting of a consortium of 11 development \npartners. The next primary education support program is jointly being prepared. \n ", "4   \nfacilitate the involvement of other interested development partners and the harmonization of \ntheir assistance. During the analysis, lessons learned from the primary education SWAP and \nfrom international experience can support the identification of options for the type of SWAP that \nwould be most suitable for secondary education in Bangladesh. \n \n14.  Critical  role  of  stakeholders. Extensive consultations with all stakeholders are an \nintegral part of the analysis and development of the implementation strategy. The reforms in the \nNEP  are  significant,  and  this  approach  should  help  increase  the  understanding  of  the \nimplications of the NEP and ownership for the chosen implementation strategy. Given the large \nrole of nongovernment providers in secondary education, ownership of the reforms is required \nfar beyond the public sector. This might require the development of new and innovative public\u2013\nprivate partnerships.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n15.  The TA will assist the government and the sector in analyzing the reforms of the NEP \nand will use this analysis to develop the implementation strategy through a consultative process. \nThe implementation strategy will include steps to create the required institutional arrangements, \na sequenced prioritization of technical improvements, a realistic financial scenario, steps to \nimprove the monitoring arrangements for providing information on learning outcomes and for \nimproving timely, accurate, and complete information on all schools, teachers, and students in \nsecondary education, and a road map with indicative timeline to move towards the most suitable \nSWAP for secondary education. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n16.  The outcome will be agreement among key stakeholders on the implementation strategy \nof  the  NEP,  including  a  road  map  for  a  SWAP.  The  impact  will  be  the  decision  of  the \ngovernment to implement the NEP in the secondary education subsector using a SWAP.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n17.  In order to reach agreement among the key stakeholders, the TA will (i) produce and \ndisseminate  an  analysis  of  institutional  arrangements,  priorities  for  technical  reforms,  and \nfinancial and monitoring implications of the secondary education reforms proposed in the NEP; \n(ii)  organize  consultations,  focus  group  discussions,  and  workshops  with  all  the  key \nstakeholders so they will understand the implications of the NEP better; 7 and (iii) organize a \nfinal workshop in which a draft implementation strategy for the NEP, including a road map with \nindicative timeline for a SWAP, will be submitted for agreement. The meaningful participation of \nall stakeholders in this process is required and assumed. Since the NEP has already been \napproved by the cabinet, it is assumed that the major reforms will be approved by Parliament \nduring its next session. \n \n                                                 \n7  Many stakeholders are involved in implementing the NEP in secondary education and need to be consulted: \nstakeholders at national level, MOE and its respective departments, MOPME and its respective departments, the \neducation boards for the different types of education, other relevant ministries and agencies, (associations of) \nnongovernment education providers, private sector entities in education, universities, development partners, and \nteacher associations, and at the grass roots level students, teachers, parents, school managers and school \nadministrators from different types of schools and institutions, and community and women\u2019s groups.  \n ", "  5\nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost $690,000 equivalent. The government has requested ADB \nto finance $600,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis, by ADB's Technical \nAssistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-IV).  The  government  will  fund  $90,000  equivalent  in  kind \nthrough provision of office accommodation and transport, and remuneration and per diem for \ncounterpart staff. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  MOE will be the executing agency for the TA, which is planned to commence in March \n2011 and complete by October 2011. An inter-ministerial steering committee, chaired by the \nsecretary of MOE, will be established to guide overall implementation. All key government \nstakeholders, including MOPME and other relevant ministries, directorates and departments, \nand key nongovernment stakeholders, especially representatives of nongovernment secondary \neducation providers like the Campaign for Popular Education (CAMPE), will be invited to join the \nsteering  committee.  A  technical  committee  with  experts  from  the  key  stakeholders  will  be \nestablished in the Directorate of Secondary and Higher Education with its director general as \nthe  chairperson  to  guide  the  technical  aspects  of  the  TA.  ADB  will  closely  monitor  TA \nimplementation by reviewing the milestones and participating in some of the major consultative \nprocesses. \n \n20.  Consulting services will be provided for a total of 40 person-months, comprising 15 \nperson-months of international and 25 person-months of national consultants. The consultants \nwill be engaged individually in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2010, as amended from time to time). The outline terms of reference for consultants are in \nAppendix 3. Disbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time), and procurement of \nequipment will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). \nEquipment  and  goods  procured  under  the  TA  will  be  handed  over  to  the  Government  of \nBangladesh at the end of the project. \n \n21.  The analysis will be developed through consultations and focus group discussions with \nall stakeholders, with whom the analytical reports will then be discussed and shared. The draft \nimplementation strategy, including a road map, will be developed based on these consultations. \nAgreement on the implementation strategy will be the goal of a final workshop. The results of \nthe proposed TA are expected to feed into a project preparatory TA that is planned for 2012 to \nprepare the next ADB support for secondary education, which will adopt a SWAP.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Secondary Education Sector \nDevelopment Project and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines Reporting Mechanisms Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nThe government  Secondary education  Policy declaration from  Close collaboration \ndecides to implement  reform will be implemented  the Ministry of Education  between several \nthe NEP in the  using a sector-wide  indicating that a sector- government and non-\nsecondary education  approach.  wide approach will be  government \nsubsector using a  adopted to implement  stakeholders is required \nsector-wide  the NEP  to implement the \napproach.   reforms envisioned in \nthe NEP \nOutcome      Assumption \nAgreement among  All key stakeholders  Minutes of the final  The NEP is tabled for \nkey stakeholders on  indicate their initial  workshop  the next session of \nthe implementation  agreement with the  parliament.

Introduction \n1.  The TA will require 15 person-months of international consultants (4 consultants) and 25 \nperson-months of national consultants (4 consultants and a pool for 6 person-months). The \nconsultants will be engaged individually in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  government  is  keen  to  start  the \ndevelopment of the implementation strategy as soon as possible after approval of the National \nEducation Policy (NEP) in parliament. Some of the consultants will work on intermittent basis or \nwill be recruited later on responding to the government requirements, which requires a flexible \napproach. The TA will be implemented over 7 months from when the consultants are first fielded. \nThe TA team will deliver the outcomes and outputs of the TA as indicated in the TA paper. The \nTA team will help ADB and the Government of Bangladesh with any other assignments in \naddition to the terms of reference below, as may be reasonably expected within their scope of \nwork. \n2.
