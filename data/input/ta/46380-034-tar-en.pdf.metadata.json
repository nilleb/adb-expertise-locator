THE ENSUING AND ONGOING PROJECTS \n1.  The transaction technical assistance facility (subproject of the Sustainable Infrastructure \nAssistance Program [SIAP] technical assistance cluster) will help prepare the following four \nproposed projects and programs: (i) the Eastern Indonesia1 Power Generation Sector Project \n(PGSP); (ii) the Eastern Indonesia Electricity Grid Development Program Phase II (EGDP II); (iii) \nthe Eastern Indonesia Power Transmission Sector Project (PTSP); and (iv) the Geothermal Power \nDevelopment Project (GPDP).  \n \n(i)  PGSP will support multiple small- to medium-sized natural gas-fired power plants \nacross Eastern Indonesia. It will help move the country away from using highly \npolluting and expensive diesel fuel and transition to using natural gas, combined \nwith variable renewable energy such as solar and wind. The project is expected \nfor Board consideration in 2018 for $600 million from ADB regular OCR and $35 \nmillion from the ASEAN Infrastructure Fund. The program is included in the \nCountry Operations Business Plan (COBP) 2018-2020. The outcome of the project \nwill be expanded access to modern and cleaner energy services in Eastern \nIndonesia. The outputs are (i) gas-fired generation capacity in Eastern Indonesia \ninstalled;  (ii)  pilot  gas-solar  hybrid  power  generation  units  installed,  and  (iii) \ninstitutional capacity enhanced for the utilization of natural gas for small- to mid-\nscale power generation and operation of gas-solar hybrid systems. \n  \n(ii)  EGDP  II  is  a  result-based  lending  (RBL)  program  and  will  support  power \ndistribution operations in Kalimantan, following Phase I of EGDP approved in 2017 \nwhich covers Sulawesi and Nusa Tenggara. The program is included in the COBP \n2018-2020 for $300 million. The outcome is equitable access to electricity for \nKalimantan\u2019s population. The outputs are (i) distribution system expanded, (ii) \nclean energy & energy efficiency enhanced, and (iii) institutional capacity and \nsocial monitoring enhanced.  \n \n(iii)  PTSP aims to support the development of 150 kV and 70 kV high voltage power \ntransmission systems across Eastern Indonesia. The project is listed in COBP \n2018-2020  for  $800  million.  Outputs  include  rehabilitation,  upgrading  and \nexpansion of 150 kV and 70 kV transmission lines; and 150/70 kV, 150/20 kV and \n70/20 kV substations in the provinces: Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Nusa Tenggara, \nMaluku and Papua.  \n \n(iv)  GPDP aims to support expansion of two geothermal power plants in Java, which \nwill contribute to Indonesia\u2019s efforts to increase renewable energy use and reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions. The outcome will be increased power generation from \ngeothermal  resources  and  lower  carbon  emissions.  The  outputs  include  the \nconstruction and commissioning of additional geothermal generating capacity at \ntwo existing geothermal power plants of 55 megawatts each. A transaction TA and \nthe proposed $300 million regular OCR allocation for the project are included in \nthe COBP 2018-2020.  \n \n2.  The  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  also  support  the  implementation  of  the  Eastern \nIndonesia Electricity Grid Development Program (EGDP) RBL program approved by the Board in \n                                                \n1  The government  uses the  term  \u201cEastern  Indonesia\u201d  to cover  all  those  islands  outside  Bali, Java, Madura, and  \n   Sumatra, specifically, provinces in Kalimantan, Nusa Tenggara, Maluku, Papua, and Sulawesi. \n ", "2 \nSeptember 2017. The TA will specifically support the implementation of three disbursement-linked \nindicators dedicated to innovation and institutional strengthening. \n  \n3.  These ensuing and ongoing projects are focused on the Indonesian electricity sector and \nrequire thorough and consistent understanding of relevant policies, regulations, and actors. TA \nactivities will involve similar preparation, due diligence, design, readiness, and implementation \nsupport activities. Therefore, this TRTA Facility will reduce transaction costs through minimizing \nthe need for stand-alone TRTAs. \n \nII.   THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE (TRTA FACILITY) \nA.  Overall Progress of the TA Cluster \n4.  The Technical Assistance Cluster (C\u2013TA) 0013\u2013INO: for the Sustainable Infrastructure \nAssistance Program (SIAP) is financed by the Government of Australia through the Department \nof Foreign Affairs and Trade, and administered by the Asian Development Bank (ADB).  SIAP \nwas approved on 17 June 2013 and is due to close on 30 June 2019. As of 25 July 2018, total \ncommitments are $13,040,712  (73% of total approvals against time elapsed of 85%), and \ndisbursements are $9,034,972 (69% of commitments). Thirteen subprojects have been approved. \nFour of these are now closed. SIAP is on track to meet its outcome and outputs, including the \npreparation and implementation of approved ADB projects and programs in Indonesia of more \nthan $5 billion. As of 25 July 2018, C\u2013TA 0013\u2013INO: SIAP has an available balance of $2,377,816, \nincluding the ADB management fee and foreign exchange reservations. \n \nB.  Subproject Scope \n5.  The role of the energy sector as a key enabler of inclusive growth has become more \nimportant  as the  Government  of Indonesia  is faced  with  the  challenge  of  diversifying  and \nexpanding its economy which has hovered around 5% annual growth. Improved access to \naffordable and sustainable forms of energy is critical to enhance competitiveness, not only in the \ncountry\u2019s manufacturing and commercial centers, but also in remote areas. Lack of access to \nenergy constrains efforts to transform the eastern part of Indonesia into a new economic growth \nengine with a focus on high-value agriculture, fisheries, small- and medium-sized enterprises, and \ntourism, all of which rely on a stable energy supply. Uneven development across provinces has \ncontributed toward widening income disparities, with several provinces in Eastern Indonesia \nlagging significantly behind Java and Bali.2 \n \n6.  To address this, the government has prioritized accelerating investment in infrastructure, \nwhich explicitly includes the \u201couter\u201d and eastern regions as geographical priorities. One of its \npillars is to significantly improve access to electricity services by adding generation capacity and \nexpanding power grids to raise the national electrification ratio from 89% in 2016 to 100% by \n2024. Eastern Indonesia, where power grids across the islands are isolated, of poor quality, and \nunderdeveloped, presents the greatest challenge to the achievement of these targets. The \nelectrification ratios in some eastern provinces are particularly low\u201461% in West Sulawesi, 67% \nin Southeast Sulawesi, 76% in West Nusa Tenggara, 52% in East Nusa Tenggara, and 50% in \nPapua.3 Moreover, these areas are mainly serviced, if at all, by diesel-fired generators which are \ninefficient, polluting, and expensive. Power disruptions due to supply shortages are common and \nhousehold consumption levels remain suppressed. \n                                                \n2  For example, Jakarta\u2019s 2016 nominal per capita gross regional domestic product ($15,670) was 13 times higher than \nthat of East Nusa Tenggara ($1,197). \n3  PLN. 2016. PLN Statistik. Jakarta. \n ", "3 \n \n7.  The series of loans supported by this TA aim to support the development of electricity \ntransmission and distribution networks to connect businesses and households and enhance the \nquality of life in remote regions across Indonesia, scale up the use of natural gas which is cleaner \nand more efficient than diesel fuel commonly used in remote areas today, and accelerate the use \nof Indonesia\u2019s vast geothermal, solar, and wind resources to help the country reduce its carbon \nemissions. One of the advantages of using gas-fired generators is that they can respond very \nrapidly to fluctuating power demand. This characteristic can be tapped to integrate intermittent \nrenewable energy systems while reducing the need for large battery storage and thus help make \nuse of solar and wind resources more affordable and reliable to the local communities. The loans \nwill  require  technical,  financial,  economic,  environment,  social,  governance  and  legal  and \nregulatory due diligence.  \n \nC.  Subproject Outputs and Activities   \n8.  Output 1: Power sector projects and programs prepared. Technical expertise will be \nprovided to prioritize, plan, and prepare a series of investment projects for potential ADB financing. \nThis will enhance the efficiency of project preparation, address cross-common issues among the \nprojects, and will reduce the transaction costs through minimizing the need for stand-alone \ntransaction TAs. Detailed activities will include, as required: (i) feasibility studies; (ii) economic \nanalysis; (iii) financial management assessments, financial evaluation and financial analysis; (iv) \nprocurement assessments, procurement plans, and preparation of bidding documents; (v) gender \nanalysis,  collection  of  baseline  data,  and  gender  action  plans;  (vi)  risk  assessment  and \nmanagement plans; and (vii) safeguards documents on environment, involuntary resettlement \nand indigenous peoples. \n \n9.  Output 2: Innovation and institutional capacity enhanced. The TA will support the \nimplementation of loan components on technological innovation, institutional strengthening, and \nknowledge sharing. These will include technical experts to support the development of smart grid \nguidelines  and  design  pilot  projects,  as  well  as  safeguards  specialists  to  improve  waste \nmanagement and stakeholder consultation practices under the Eastern Indonesia Electricity Grid \nDevelopment Program (EGDP for Sulawesi and Nusa Tenggara). Experts will also provide \ntechnical support for the Eastern Indonesia Power Generation Sector Project to accelerate the \nimplementation of subprojects and provide technical inputs for the solar\u2013gas hybrid pilot projects. \nThe  TA  will  also  support  knowledge  development  and  sharing  between  PLN,  government \nministries, and other key stakeholders for policy and regulatory development and energy sector \nplanning, particularly related to increasing natural gas and renewable energy use in Eastern \nIndonesia. \n \nD.  Subproject Cost and Financing \n10.  The TRTA subproject is estimated to cost $1,530,000, of which $1,500,000 will be \nfinanced from the C-TA 0013\u2013INO: SIAP on a grant basis by the Government of Australia, and \nadministered by ADB. The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 1. The government, \nincluding  its  State-Owned  Enterprises,  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of \ncommunication facilities and other in-kind contributions. The government was informed that \napproval of the subproject does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \n ", "4 \nE.  Subproject Implementation Arrangements \n11.  The TA activities for ensuing investment projects and programs will commence only after \nthe concept paper for the associated project and program is approved by ADB. Concept papers \nfor the EGDP II, PTSP, and GPDP are expected to be approved in the second half of 2018.  \n \n12.  ADB\u2019s Energy Division, Southeast Asia Department will select, supervise, and evaluate \nconsultants\u2019 outputs for the respective loan projects. PLN will be the executing agency with PLN \nand Geo Dipa Energi (GDE) as the implementing agencies. ADB will administer the TA and be \nresponsible for consultant recruitment in consultation with PLN and GDE. PLN and GDE will \nmobilize its staff to participate in undertaking analytical work and provide documents, mission \nfacilitation, and other support to carry out the activities. \n \nTable 1: Subproject Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  June 2018\u2013June 2019 \nExecuting agency  PLN \nImplementing agency  PLN & GDE  \nTo be selected and engaged by ADB  \nConsultants  Individual consultants  46 person-months  $584,984 \nFirm through QCBS (90:10)  54 person-months  $827,711 \nADB will engage consultants and all technical assistance financed goods \nshall be procured in accordance with ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as \nProcurement \namended from time to time) and the associated Project Administration \nInstructions/TA Staff Instructions. \nThe TA will be disbursed following ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \nAsset Turnover of Disposal  Assets purchased under the transaction technical assistance will be \nArrangement upon TA Completion  handed over to PLN \nADB = Asian Development Bank, GDE = Geo Dipa Energi,  PLN = State Electricity Corporation, QCBS = quality- and \ncost-based selection, TA = technical assistance   \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n13.
