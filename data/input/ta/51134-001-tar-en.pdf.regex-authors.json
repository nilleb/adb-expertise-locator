INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The  proposed  knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  support  the \nGovernment of Mongolia in preparing a health sector master plan (HSMP) for 2019\u20132027. The \nproposed TA will provide institutional and human resource capacity to the Ministry of Health (MOH) \nto develop a strategic framework through 2027. This will enable the MOH to pursue its long-term \ndevelopment policy on health in accordance with Mongolia\u2019s commitments to health-related \ntargets under the Mongolia Sustainable Development Vision 2030 (SDV 2030).1 \n \n2.  The TA is included in the country operations business plan, 2017\u20132019 of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) for Mongolia and is consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, \n2017\u20132020 for Mongolia, which emphasizes social development through the efficient delivery of \nhealth services under the strategy\u2019s health and social protection focus.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  In the 1990s, Mongolia implemented reforms that successfully transformed its former \nSoviet-style hospital-based approach into a more efficient people-oriented health care system. \nChallenges persist, however, including improving sector efficiency and health service delivery, \nquality, availability, and accessibility; increasing financial support and protection for the people; \nand improving sector governance. Achieving these targets requires close coordination between \ngovernment agencies and a well-planned sequencing of reforms. As the Health Sector Strategic \nMaster Plan (HSSMP), 2005\u201320153 has expired, developing a new master plan is essential to \nensure that government targets are achieved and hard-won gains in key health indicators, such \nas the improvements achieved in maternal and infant mortality, are sustained. The HSMP will \nbuild on the 2017 State Policy on Health, which defines the core principles and development goals \nfor the health sector for 2017\u20132026.4 The overarching goals of the government objectives are to \n(i) extend life expectancy by improving the quality and inclusiveness of health care services \nthrough the introduction of reliable technology in prevention, diagnostics, and treatment; and \n(ii) develop  an  adequate  health  care  financing  system  and  good  sector  governance  amid \neconomic difficulty and fiscal budget constraints. The HSMP, which will align closely with the SDV \n2030 health targets, is instrumental to achieving these goals. \n \n4.  Widespread staff turnover at the MOH since 2012 because of political instability has \nresulted in capacity constraints, leading to the suspension or interruption of several policy \ninitiatives. Lack of handover mechanisms and regular professional training compounds the \nsituation. Some 90 MOH staff and 380 staff in 23 provincial health departments involved in policy \nplanning and coordination need training. This prevents the MOH from assessing the impact and \npitfalls of the reforms implemented since 1990s, which hampers evidence-based decision-making \non health sector reforms and strategies. Addressing capacity constraints is essential to ensure \nthe effective implementation of the government\u2019s policy actions and better coordination and \nintegration of internal and external resources in the health sector. \n \n                                                \n1  The State Great Khural of Mongolia. 2016.

Since 1997, ADB has been the leading development partner for the Government of \nMongolia and the MOH to reform the country\u2019s health care system. ADB has contributed to (i) \nreforming the health service delivery system by developing a primary health care and referral \nsystem and introducing a public\u2013private partnership concept in service delivery, (ii) rationalizing \nhospital services and improving hospital management and governance, (iii) improving sector \ngovernance  by  introducing  licensing  and  accreditation  systems  and  information  and \ncommunication technology systems for health statistics and reporting, and (iv) reforming the \nhealth care financing system by introducing new payment methods and output-based budgeting \nprinciples. The government has requested ADB\u2019s support in preparing the HSMP to ensure the \neffective development and implementation of sector targets, which will include capacity building \nfor effective sector-wide management at the MOH. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n6.  The TA is aligned with the following impacts: (i) access to and quality of preventive, \ndiagnostic, and medical services improved; and (ii) government strategic programming, health \ncare policy development, and planning enhanced.5 The TA will have the following outcome: health \nsector midterm strategic framework developed.6 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n7.  Output 1: Health sector master plan, 2019\u20132027 developed. This output will focus on \ndeveloping the HSMP, 2019\u20132027. The development process will (i) assess the previous HSSMP \nto identify the achievements and lessons learned; (ii) assess the major health sector reforms \nundertaken since 1990s; (iii) review situational analysis documents to define the core strategic \nareas and build on State Policy on Health priorities and SDV 2030 objectives and targets; (iv) \ndevelop strategies in core priority areas; and (v) draft a master plan and its supporting documents, \nincluding a midterm expenditure framework and financial and investment plans. \n \n8.  The TA will establish a stakeholders\u2019 consultation and coordination mechanism at the \nMOH to ensure the participation of all stakeholders, a sector-wide approach, and ownership of \nthe development of the HSMP. The TA will publish the HSMP and its supporting documents, such \nas (i) the midterm investment framework, (ii) the planning and budgeting framework, (iii) the \nmidterm expenditure framework, (iv) the monitoring and evaluation framework, and (v) the \nimplementation framework, in digital and print formats and in Mongolian and English. The print \ndocuments will serve as reference documents for government staff and decision makers at all \nlevels, including rural soums (districts) and aimags (provinces) with limited or no access to internet, \nnongovernment agencies, international partners, academia, and research institutions involved in \nhealth care service delivery, planning, and implementation. \n \n9.  Output 2: Planning, monitoring, and coordination capacity of the Ministry of Health \nstrengthened. This output will focus on institutional capacity building to strengthen the planning \nand coordination functions and the technical skills of staff at the MOH and local government \nagencies through a learning-by-doing approach.
