THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  for  the  Multimodal  Passenger  Hub  and  Railway \nMaintenance Project.  \n \n2.  The project will assist China Railway Corporation (CRC) in developing modern, energy-\nefficient,  and sustainable  transport  solutions  in  the  southwestern  region  of the  PRC.1 The \ngovernment of the PRC is developing a new railway line connecting the provincial capitals of \nSichuan and Yunnan provinces. The development of this railway line is a major initiative for this \nregion, and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) is already providing assistance for developing \nthe safety aspects on this line.2 The project will construct a demonstration multimodal hub3 on \nthis line in Xichang city in Sichuan province, improve maintenance systems by introducing modern \nmaintenance equipment, and enhance institutional capacity for railway maintenance.4 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Lagging railway development in the southwestern region of the People\u2019s Republic \nof China. The rail transport subsector is vital to the economic and social development in this \nregion, and its expansion is needed to extend the benefits of development to people living in the \nregion.  Railway  development  has  lagged  in  the  southwestern  region  owing  to  the  highly \nmountainous terrain, which makes railway construction difficult. This constrains economic growth, \nparticularly in landlocked provinces like Yunnan and Sichuan. This region has also lagged in \neconomic development, and gross domestic product per capita remains low, especially compared \nwith the more prosperous eastern provinces: out of the 31 administrative divisions in the PRC, \nSichuan province is ranked 23rd and Yunnan province 30th. The government recognizes the \nvirtues of the railway as a cheaper, safer, and more fuel-efficient mode compared to other \ntransport modes. It has the potential for greater speed and the capacity to provide demand-\nresponsive sustainable development along core economic corridors without taking much land \narea, if properly planned and developed. In the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, 2016\u20132020, the \ngovernment  has  placed  special  emphasis  on  expanding  the  railway  network  to  promote \nsustainable development in poorer and undeveloped provinces.5 The plan envisages removing \nexisting constraints in railway capacity and enhancing railway development in the western region \nby developing intercity rail networks to support inclusive development and reduce inequality and \npoverty. \n \n4.  Chengdu\u2013Kunming railway line. The existing line connecting the capital cities of Yunnan \nand Sichuan provinces was constructed in 1970, is a single-track line with operating speeds of \n40\u201360 kilometers (km) per hour, and has been operating at near full capacity for more than \n10 years. To expand capacity across the southwestern region of the PRC, a new railway line is \nbeing developed. The new Chengdu\u2013Kunming railway line (CKRL) involves the construction of \n                                                \n1  The project is included as a firm project for 2019 in ADB. 2018.

Outline of the Thirteenth Five-Year \nPlan for National Economic and Social Development of the People\u2019s Republic of China, 2016\u20132020. Beijing (adopted \nin 2016). ", "2 \n860 km (645 km in Sichuan and 215 km in Yunnan) of railway line for passenger and freight \ntransportation. The new CKRL is 22% shorter (236 km) than the existing single-track line \n(1,096 km). Trains on the new railway line will be able to run at 160 km per hour compared with \nthe existing speed of only 60 km per hour. The capacity for passenger trains per day would \nincrease from 24 to 70. The shorter alignment and faster train speeds will shorten the travel time \nto less than 8 hours for passenger trains. Presently, it takes 18\u201322 hours for people to travel from \nChengdu to Kunming via rail. The shorter travel time is likely to make the railway a more attractive \ntravel option, and it is estimated that there will be a modal shift of 3.2 million passengers from \nroad to railway after the new line becomes operational, which will reduce energy consumption \nand lower carbon emissions. \n \n5.  Need for integrated and energy-efficient multimodal hubs. In the PRC, new railway \nstations often do not meet the needs of passengers, as they are often located far from city centers \nand are not well integrated with cities\u2019 transport systems. Thus, while the new railway lines will \nfacilitate faster intercity travel, the stations also need to be efficiently linked to city centers with \nwell-designed multimodal transport infrastructure and high-quality integrated public transport \nservices.  This  will  enhance  the  quality  of  the  journey  experience  for  passengers  and  will \nencourage increased use of public transport. This will reduce transport costs, increase travel \nopportunities and regional accessibility to jobs and services, and promote economic development \nand poverty reduction. One of most important multimodal hubs on the CKRL will be developed in \nXichang city in Sichuan province, which has a population of about 775,000. It is rich in agriculture \nand food processing industries, is one of the centers of the PRC\u2019s space satellite program, and is \na popular tourist destination. It is estimated that 2.8 million passengers will use the Xichang \nmultimodal hub in 2025. Developing Xichang into a well-designed multimodal hub could have a \nmajor demonstration impact for the region. One of the most important strategic objectives of all \ndevelopment initiatives in the PRC is the reduction of energy consumption and carbon emissions \nacross sectors. In the PRC, buildings alone consume over 20% of the total energy produced, and \na shift toward green buildings is of great importance. The rail transport subsector in the PRC has \ndeveloped rapidly, with the number of stations now exceeding 5,000, so the subsector should pay \nsufficient attention to the use of energy in the stations. Railway stations can be developed as a \nmodel to demonstrate best practices in energy efficiency. \n \n6.  Ensuring sustainability through improved maintenance. Good maintenance practices \nare an integral part of providing competitive, high-quality, and reliable railway transportation. The \nPRC railway network is managed and maintained by 18 bureaus that are wholly owned and \ncontrolled by CRC. The new CKRL line will be managed and maintained by Chengdu Railway \nBureau (CRB). By the end of 2016, the network size under CRB had reached 9,100 km. Of this, \nabout 2,100 km of track had an operating speed of 200 km per hour and above, and the remaining \n7,000 km was ordinary railway track. The volume of traffic carried was 210 million passengers, \nand 190 million tons of freight. The railway lines managed by CRB are typically in mountainous \nareas. The geological situation is complex, and the topography and landscape are hazardous. \nThe  difficult  terrain  poses  major  challenges  for  conventional  maintenance  systems.  Over \n1,500 km of the network has curves with a radius of fewer than 600 meters, which causes rapid \ntrack wear and deformation and requires careful monitoring. CRB\u2019s current maintenance and \ninspection equipment are insufficient. The maintenance staff have limited capacity and often \nstruggle to keep up with the demands of the rapidly growing network, which is increasingly difficult \nto maintain owing to the surge in operating speeds. \n \n7.  Regional cooperation. The southwestern PRC has good economic complementarities \nwith South Asian and Southeast Asian countries, and bilateral trade is growing rapidly. Bordering \nthe  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic,  Myanmar,  and  Viet  Nam,  the  provinces  of  the \nsouthwestern  PRC  form  a  regional  cooperation  link  between  the  PRC  and  Association  of \n ", "3 \nSoutheast Asian Nations. The new CKRL will, together with the pan-Asia railway, constitute an \ninternational railway channel (i) connecting the PRC with the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic \nMyanmar, and Viet Nam; (ii) playing a key role in strengthening communication and trade \nbetween the PRC and Southeast Asia and South Asia; and (iii) promoting the development of the \nPRC\u2013Association of Southeast Asian Nations free trade area.6 The PRC further needs assistance \nin ensuring that the line is (i) properly integrated with other transport modes through well-designed \nmultimodal hubs, and (ii) made sustainable by having an improved maintenance system in place. \n \n8.  Strategic  priorities.  The  project  supports  a  number  of  the  operational  priorities  of \nStrategy 2030.7 By improving maintenance and thus reliability of railway operations, the project, \nwhich is located in a less-developed area of Sichuan province in the southwestern PRC, will \naddress poverty by improving access to markets and nonfarm employment opportunities. The \nproject incorporates distinct gender-sensitive design features to enhance women\u2019s inclusion and \nparticipation, and ensure that women benefit from the railway line and station. The project will \nsupport climate change mitigation by maximizing the passenger hub\u2019s (i) capacity to facilitate \nefficient intermodal connectivity and (ii) incorporation of energy efficiency features. The project \ncontributes to climate change mitigation by enabling a modal shift to railways, which are less \ncarbon intensive compared with other modes of transportation. The location of the new passenger \nhub on an important railway line will strengthen its demonstration effect on the development of \nrailway stations in cities of similar size in the PRC. By improving railway maintenance on an \ninternational railway corridor linking the PRC and Southeast Asia, the project will (i) strengthen \nservice delivery and improve institutional capacity, and (ii) facilitate regional cooperation. Through \nits support for climate change mitigation and regional cooperation, the project supports regional \npublic goods. Overall the project improves access to market and jobs thereby directly impacting \nlivelihoods of the people in the region. \n \n9.  The project is aligned with the strategic priorities of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for \nthe PRC, 2016\u20132020 in supporting inclusive economic growth, as the project is in a less-\ndeveloped region (Sichuan province in the southwestern PRC).8 The project will help the PRC \naddress the challenges highlighted above, and deepen the cooperation between the government \nand ADB by helping to develop the rail transport mode into a sustainable transport system for \nfreight and passengers. The project is in line with ADB\u2019s Sustainable Transport Initiative, which \nhighlights railway development as an important opportunity for sustainable transport operations.9 \nThe project is consistent with the PRC Thirteenth Five-Year Plan\u2019s objectives of balanced \ndevelopment of rural and urban areas, better transport connectivity, and inclusive urbanization \n(footnote 5). The CKRL is also part of the PRC\u2019s medium- and long-term railway network plan, \nwhich seeks to improve the railway system, especially in the central and western PRC.10 \n \n10.  Value  added  by  ADB  assistance.  ADB  will  add  value  to  the  project  through  the \nincorporation of design features to enhance the sustainability and efficiency of the multimodal hub, \nprocurement of advanced technology railway maintenance equipment, and incorporation of \ngender-sensitive features. ADB has played a significant role in supporting CRC\u2019s development of  \nmultimodal passenger hubs in the PRC, including through the provision of technical assistance.11 \n                                                \n6  The Pan-Asia railway (also known as the Kunming\u2013Singapore railway) refers to a network of railway lines, planned \nor under construction, that would connect the PRC to Singapore and the countries of mainland Southeast Asia. \n7  ADB. 2018.

Manila. \n ", "4 \nADB\u2019s support for the development of the multimodal hub in Xichang city will add value through \n(i) an emphasis on the use of recycled materials to ensure sustainable construction, (ii) the \nextensive use of renewable energy sources and energy efficiency features in building design, and \n(iii) a design to maximize connectivity between different transport modes to facilitate intermodal \ntransfers for passengers. ADB will also add value by financing procurement of modern track \nmaintenance equipment using international advertising. Investing in high-quality, state-of-the-art \nmaintenance equipment will yield substantial benefits by improving the reliability and operational \nefficiency of train operations and facilitating sustainability. The capacity building activities will \nassist in the development of an integrated approach to maintenance systems, which is needed to \nmaintain  the  intensively  used  railway  infrastructure.  ADB\u2019s  involvement  will  also  prioritize \nmaintenance, which in the past in the PRC has been given lower priority than the construction of \nnew railway lines. The concentration of passengers arising from connecting transport modes will \nfacilitate the development of private-sector market opportunities. ADB will also ensure the project \nincorporates distinctive gender-sensitive design to enhance the level of satisfaction, comfort, and \nsafety of women using public transportation. These features include improved safety features, \nuniversal design to facilitate accessibility of people, and improved signage. The project has also \nset targets to contribute to women\u2019s economic empowerment through project-related employment \nand to ensure that women railway staff strengthen their knowledge and skills to improve their \nemployment and career prospects. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  sustainable  railway  system  in  the \nsouthwestern PRC developed (footnotes 5 and 10). The project will have the following outcome: \nintegrated, energy-efficient, and sustainable railway corridor in Sichuan province developed.12 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n12.  Output  1:  Multimodal  passenger  hub  developed.  The  project  will  construct  a \nmultimodal  passenger  hub  in  Xichang  (Xichang  west  station),  which  is  a  growing  tourist \ndestination in Sichuan province.13 Xichang city is the capital of Liangshan prefecture in Sichuan \nprovince, located in the middle of the CKRL.14 The hub will include good intermodal connectivity \nand energy efficiency features in the form of improved insulation and enhanced air ventilation \nsystems, and conform to PRC\u2019s standard for green buildings.15 It will have improved drainage \nsystems to adapt to the risk of flooding and will generate renewable energy generation through \nsolar power. The hub will incorporate inclusive and gender-sensitive features for a bus station for \nlong-distance,  local,  and  tourist  buses;  ticketing  and  support  facilities;  parking  for  cars, \nmotorcycles, and bicycles; and pedestrian walkways linking the railway station to other transport \nmodes to facilitate intermodal transfers. \n \n13.  Output 2: Railway maintenance improved. Track-renewal and track-laying operations \nrequire high expenditure for personnel and machines. With the help of mechanized work methods, \nthese costs can be significantly reduced and a higher quality can be achieved. This output will \nprocure modern railway track maintenance machines. The equipment will cover track inspection \nand repair, as well as rescue and restoration. This output will also include capacity building for \n                                                \n12 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n13 About 18.20 million tourists visited in Xichang in 2013, which was 18.69% higher than the 15.33 million in 2012, with \ntourism revenue of CNY10.52 billion in 2013 compared with CNY8.06 billion in 2012. \n14 Xichang west station will be built in Xichang\u2019s newly urbanized area, 10 km northwest of the existing city and 9 km \nsouthwest of Xichang Qingshan Airport. \n15 Government of the PRC, Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development. 2014.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n21.  The project will finance railway maintenance equipment and a multimodal passenger hub \nin Xichang. Some of the specific equipment to be procured under the project includes track \nreplacement and ballast compacting machines, tunnel inspection vehicles, and accident relief \nvehicles. The preliminary technical specifications of the equipment have been reviewed, and it \nhas been confirmed that the equipment is compatible with and suitable for the maintenance \nrequirements of the railway network in the region. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n22.  The ADB-financed multimodal passenger hub and mechanized maintenance equipment \ncomponents were assessed individually. The economic benefits of the multimodal passenger hub \ninclude reduced travel time and vehicle operating costs, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and \nbenefits from improved safety. The economic benefits from the maintenance equipment include \nlabor cost savings and reduced consumption of railway materials (rail, ballast, and sleepers) \nbecause of the higher productivity and work quality of mechanized maintenance machines \ncompared with CRB\u2019s existing equipment. The project will result in large positive net economic \nbenefits. The economic internal rate of return for the project is 22.23% and the net present value \nat a 9% discount rate is CNY1.75 billion. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the results are \nrobust and that the project would maintain its economic viability under most plausible scenarios. \n \n23.  A financial analysis was undertaken to assess the financial sustainability of the project \nbased  on  the  fiscal  impact  of  (i)  counterpart  funds  during  the  project,  (ii)  operation  and \nmaintenance costs, and (iii) the loan repayment obligation. CRC will be responsible for all financial \nobligations. The total project cost to be financed by the government represents up to 0.19% of \nthe 2017 total revenue of CRC. After project implementation, ADB\u2019s loan repayment, financing \ncharges, and recurrent costs will be about 0.84% of the projected annual revenue of the railway \nline. The project is financially sustainable based on the financial sustainability analysis of CRC\u2019s \nfinancial health and the projected revenues and expenditures of the railway line. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n24.  Financial management. The financial management assessment (FMA) was conducted \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Financial Management and Analysis of Projects19 and Financial Due \nDiligence: a Methodology Note and related technical guidance notes.20 The FMA concluded that \nthe capacity of both CRC and CKRC is adequate, and the overall financial management risk is \nmoderate. CRC has prior and ongoing experience in implementing ADB projects and has an \nunderstanding of ADB procurement, disbursement, and financial management procedures. The \nFMA  recommended  that  CKRC  further  strengthen  its  financial  management  capability  by \nundertaking training, particularly on ADB policy and its procedural requirements for financial \nmanagement, including financial reporting and disbursement.21 \n \n25.  Procurement and anticorruption measures. All procurement to be financed under the \nADB loan will be done in accordance with the ADB Procurement Policy and Procurement \nRegulations for ADB Borrowers. The relevant sections of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \namended  to  date)  will  be  included  in  all  procurement  documents  and  contracts.

The specific \npolicy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 17). \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n26.  Poverty and social. The causes of poverty include (i) low profits from local products \nbecause of lack of market access and local processing of agricultural products, (ii) lack of local \nnonfarm employment opportunities, (iii) insufficient access to health care, (iv) vulnerability to \nclimate change and other environmental degradation; and (v) lack of access to credit and other \nsocial services. The project will improve maintenance and reliability of higher-speed railway \noperations that provide access to regional markets, thereby increasing profit margins and raising \nrural incomes and improving livelihoods. \n \n27.  Project beneficiaries. The project has the potential to benefit people in the project area \nthrough (i) employment during project construction and operation; (ii) improved access to markets, \ntransport, and other services through the larger railway line development; and (iii) integration of \nthe project area with regional trade and commerce. Rural households will increase and diversify \ntheir agricultural production to include more market-oriented agriculture because of expanded \naccess to markets and the ability to move bulk goods, improving their quality of life thanks to \nbetter access to goods, services, and social infrastructure at less cost. Improved access to \nmarkets will facilitate investment in local processing industry and value addition to agricultural \nproduce and generation of nonfarm employment. Travel time to destinations along the Chengdu\u2013\nKunming railway line will be reduced significantly. \n \n28.  Gender. The project is categorized as having some gender elements.22 Women in the \nproject area have differentiated transport needs arising from their combined engagement in \nproductive activities and in caring roles such as travelling with children and the elderly. These \ngender roles result in specific mobility patterns and accessibility issues. Women also tend to have \nhigher concerns for personal safety when using public transportation. To address women\u2019s \nspecific  transportation  needs,  the  project  incorporates  distinctive  gender-sensitive  design, \nincluding improved safety features such as lighting and CCTV in waiting areas and around hubs; \nuniversal design to facilitate accessibility of people using mobility aids, strollers, and those helping \nothers; and improved signage in and around hubs for the easy location of reserved seating, baby \ncare rooms, toilets, and lockers. These measures will enhance the level of satisfaction, comfort, \nand safety of women when using public transportation. The project has also set targets to \ncontribute to women\u2019s economic empowerment through employment during construction and \noperation of the hub. Targets have also been set to ensure women railway staff actively participate \nin  technical  training  and  update  their  knowledge  and  skills  on  new  railway  maintenance \napproaches, increasing their employability and chances for career progression. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n29.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.23 \n \n30.  Environment  (category  B).  The  project\u2019s  categorization  mainly  reflects  the \nenvironmental impact associated with the construction of Xichang multimodal passenger station. \nThe initial environmental examination (IEE) complies with ADB\u2019s policies and requirements, \nincluding ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, and identifies potential adverse impacts. During \nconstruction, such risks would include (i) soil erosion, (ii) construction noise and dust affecting \n                                                \n22 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 ADB. Safeguard Categories. https://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/safeguard-categories. \n ", "9 \nlocal residents, (iii) inappropriate storage of construction materials and wastes, and (iv) safety of \nconstruction workers. During operation, limited adverse impacts are anticipated, except for noise \nbecause of increased travelers. The IEE concludes that those impacts can be mitigated through \nthe implementation of the environmental management plan, which specifies mitigation measures, \nmonitoring requirements, and institutional responsibilities for ensuring proper environmental \nmanagement throughout the project\u2019s construction and operation. The executing agency has \nconsiderable experience with previous ADB and World Bank projects. Both the executing and \nimplementing agencies are committed to managing the identified environmental risks and have \nagreed on a comprehensive set of mitigation measures and a training program with a strong \nemphasis on environment safeguards. The IEE was posted on the ADB website. Environment \nsafeguard documents were disclosed to the affected people. Potential environmental complaints \nor disputes will be handled in accordance with the grievance redress mechanism established for \nthe project. A rapid climate risk assessment concludes that climate risk is medium, and the most \nsignificant risk to the project area and its vicinities relates to flooding. During the detailed \nengineering design of the station, flood risk will be addressed by incorporating a sufficient \ndrainage system at the Xichang multimodal hub. \n \n31.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). For output 1, a total of 530 mu of collective land \nwas acquired for the construction of the Xichang multimodal hub, affecting 45 households with \n187 persons.24 The total cost of land acquisition and resettlement was CNY38.7 million. Land \nacquisition and house demolition were completed by December 2017. A social compliance audit \nreport was prepared in accordance with ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement and posted on the \nADB website.25 Furthermore, a Resettlement Due Diligence Report for associated facilities (the \nE\u2019mei\u2013Miyi Main Rail Line from E\u2019meishan City to Miyi County) was prepared and posted on the \nADB website.26 The two reports include a corrective actions plan with time-bound actions to \naddress the remaining resettlement issues. The implementing agency is committed to monitor \nand work closely with the relevant government agencies to manage resettlement issues. The \nexecuting agency will engage an external monitor for semiannual monitoring and reporting. Public \nconsultations were undertaken during project preparation and will continue throughout the project \ncycle. A grievance redress mechanism has been established to address affected people\u2019s \nconcerns and suggestions. Output 2 involves the procurement of maintenance equipment and \ntherefore has no land acquisition and resettlement issues. \n \n32.  Indigenous peoples (category C). There are no ethnic minority communities that will be \nadversely affected by the project. \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n33.  The overall risk is assessed to be low. The integrated benefits and impacts are expected \nto outweigh the costs. The project is formulated to minimize potential risks. Sensitivity tests \nindicate that economic circumstances would have to worsen substantially for the investment \nprogram to lose its economic viability. CRC has successfully implemented ADB-financed projects \nin the past. \n \n34.  Risks associated with potential changes in government policy are minimal. An analysis of \nthe demand for railway transport shows that the southwestern PRC needs additional railway \nmaintenance capacity to sustain its transport development. The equipment to be procured and \nincluded  in  this  project  is  based  on  proven  and  suitable  international  designs.  CRC  has \n                                                \n24 A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 0.067 square meters). \n25 Social Compliance Audit Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26 Resettlement Due Diligence Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "10 \nexperience in procuring and implementing new technologies successfully, and these can be \ncommissioned  within  a  relatively  short  time.
