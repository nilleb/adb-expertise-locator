To further its policy on strengthening the commercial and financial capacities of water \nand  infrastructure  utilities,  the  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  has \nrequested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide technical assistance (TA) to build the \ncapacity for a corporate utility bond issue to fund water and environmental sector projects in \nNanjing. The fact-finding mission that was conducted from 1 to 7 March 2005 reached an \nunderstanding with Nanjing Urban Construction Investment Holding (Group) Co Ltd (NCIC) on \nthe  TA  objectives,  scope,  financing,  and  implementation  arrangements.1  The  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \n2.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  ADB,  the  Government  of  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed TA. In \naddition, the Government will be asked to confirm that Section 3.02 (b), and the assurances \nrelating  to  the  extension  of  privileges,  immunities  and  exemptions  of  ADB  consultants  in \nparagraphs 7 through 9 of the Schedule to the Technical Assistance Framework Agreement, \ndated 23 December, 1996, between the Government and ADB apply to any ADB consultants \nunder the TA (Extended No-objection).  No activities under the TA will commence and no TA \nconsultant will be contractually engaged by ADB unless and until the Government Extended No-\nobjection has been attained. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.   The established practice in large PRC cities has been for water supply services to be \nprovided by a water supply utility company, and this has been the case in Nanjing with the \nNanjing Tap Water General Company originally established in 1929. In contrast, wastewater \nservices have traditionally been provided by government departments or government agencies.  \nOver the last 5 years, as part of the broader transition from a planned to a market economy, the \nnational Government policy has been changing in respect of the role of the government and \nhow public services should be delivered.  The government at all levels has and is continuing to \nundergo reforms that involve downsizing and the government role is changing from service \nprovider to service facilitator and regulator.  Part of this policy shift has been to encourage the \nestablishment of enterprise companies to manage and deliver wastewater services,  a service \nthat is often best undertaken through an integrated water and wastewater services company. A \ncombined utility company will result in (i) economies of scale to facilitate the ongoing import of \nnew  technology;  (ii)  cost  savings  via  common  maintenance,  materials  management, \nlaboratories, and other support services for both component businesses; and (iii) access to \ncapital markets in the PRC, which are currently open mainly to large-scale borrowers. \n \n4.  The Government is actively trying to promote the expansion and efficient operation of its \ndomestic currency bond market. However, any reforms to open the market need to reinforce \ngovernment policies to restrict market access to borrowers with a good credit risk profile. This \nmove will allow a  broad range of bond market investors, including insurance companies, \ncommercial banks, trust companies, and investment managers (acting on behalf of pension \nfunds) to invest in corporate bonds based only on the credit of the issuer. In recent years, urban \nutilities have not been among successful applicants for bond issues in the PRC. In this vein, it \nwill be important for the comfort of both regulators and the investor markets that the first such \nbond issuers are able to demonstrate professional management, transparent financial reporting, \nhigh credit ratings from international agencies with operations in the PRC, and utility revenue \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 29 March 2005. \n ", "2   \nbond structuring in line with international standards. While ADB continues to support bond \nmarket development via technical assistance to the Government and is planning to act as a \nbond issuer in its own right in the RMB bond market, its most significant contribution to the \nsupply side of the market would be the support of a high quality bond issuer in the key urban \nutility sector. \n \n5.  In  accordance  with  national  policy,  the  Nanjing  Municipal  Government  (NMG) \nestablished NCIC in November 2002 as a holding company to own and manage a wide range of \nconstruction-related businesses formerly run directly by the Government. NCIC continues to be \nwholly owned by NMG and works in close cooperation with its owner in the development of \nurban infrastructure. Recently, NCIC decided to create a parent company for its water and \nwastewater businesses, with the expectation that commercial and financial synergies can be \nachieved. In creating such a new company structure, both NCIC and NMG are cognizant of the \ncentral future role that such a company (to be called Nanjing Water Services Group Limited \n[NWSG]) can play in future financing of the water and environment sectors.2 NWSG, as other \nwater utilities in the PRC, will have limited capital-raising alternatives to meet dramatically \nincreased funding requirements. Large urban utility companies will, in the future, be expected to \nbe entirely responsible for their own financing without reliance on central, provincial, or even \nmunicipal government financing. In this environment, commercial bank loans will be expected to \nbe  the  prime  source  of  recurring  financing  for  capital  projects.  Over  time,  however,  high \ndomestic bank liquidity cannot be assumed, and improving domestic bank credit culture would \nbe expected to severely restrict lending to water/wastewater enterprise companies unable to \nshow credit strength on a stand-alone basis. Therefore sustainable access by NWSG and other \nNanjing utility companies to bond markets rather than commercial bank markets alone is critical. \nBond market finance has an additional advantage over commercial bank finance inasmuch as it \nis frequently provided on a long-term fixed-rate basis. This is particularly important to water \nsector utilities that have a long utility asset average life and require protection of a low-margin \nbusiness from significant interest rate volatility. \n \n6.  PRC  laws  and  regulations  governing  corporate  bond  approvals  by  the  National \nDevelopment  and  Reform  Commission  (NDRC)  requirements  include  3  years\u2019  profitable \noperations. As the newly established NWSG has urgent funding needs and cannot meet this \nrequirement, the likely issuer of the bonds would be a multiple utility business company that is \neither a parent or an affiliate company for NWSG.3 The TA, however, would assume that (i) the \nbond issue funds only NWSG project costs; and (ii) NWSG would agree to follow international \nstandards for utility revenue bond covenants for loan repayment, anticipating its status as an \nindependent issuer following 3 years of profitable operations. The TA further assumes that \nNWSG will benefit from experience of bond issuance by a parent company for use at the time \nwhen it can eventually issue its own bonds.  PRC regulations also give reassurance in this \nrespect, as proceeds from bond issues can be assigned only to specific nominated projects and \nis not used as general working capital by the bond issuer. \n \n7.  The challenge of raising long-term bond finance requires that NWSG have in place \nmanagement capacity, an organization structure, and corporate governance that are in line with \ninternational  best  practices.  NWSG's  relatively  recent  formation  makes  for  good  timing  of \neffective and sustainable implementation of advice given in this area. Enhancing capacity to \n                                                 \n2  NWSG  is expected  to be one of the implementing agencies for the proposed public sector project loan for \nenvironmental improvements in Nanjing. \n3  Nanjing Public Utility Company (NPUC) is the proposed bond issuer. This will be confirmed during the TA and will \nbe based on the TA findings.  \n ", "  3\nraise finance via corporate utility bond issue would provide a strong incentive. As the PRC \nmoves  closer  to  international  bond  markets  standards,  utilities  would  be  expected  to \ndemonstrate long-term stability and operate relatively free from day-to-day political interference \nor  controversies  concerning  rate-setting  policies.  This  is  underpinned  by  the  long-term \nmaintenance  of  professional  financial  management  and  planning  practices,  affordable  tariff \nrates, manageable and well-planned capital programs, and segregation of enterprise business \nfinances from those of the general government.4\n \n8.  While municipal governments in the PRC do not have authority to issue general purpose \nmunicipal  bonds,  in  part  due  to  perceived  lack  of  transparency  of  municipal  government \nfinances, progress is being made toward future authorization of bond issues of single-purpose \nutilities. One major water utility bond issue is already in preparation in Shanghai under a United \nStates Trade and Development Agency technical assistance grant.5 The bond market (unlike \nthe current bank market) would be expected to introduce discipline under a system of investor \nmandated detailed regular credit reviews. The introduction of credit rating agencies with global \nutility specialists into the bond issuance provides an independent reviewer, without business \ninterests  tied  to  a  near-term  successful  bond  issue  outcome.  Currently,  under  NDRC \nregulations, domestic credit ratings from an accredited PRC agency are required. However, \ndomestic credit rating agencies do not presently have deeply specialized utility rating units and \nhave  in  the  past  outsourced  training  and  used  periodic  technology  transfer  arrangements \ndirectly  or  indirectly  from  international  credit  rating  agencies6  for  specialized  borrower \nclassifications (such as utilities). For pilot utility bond issues such as that being contemplated in \nNanjing, direct international rating agency involvement would bring the advantage of subjecting \nutilities  to  international  rating  standards  thereby  improving  in  water  utility  finance  and \nmanagement standards. Their ability to deliver ratings would allow the private investor base7 to \nbe expanded to more conservative long-term investors with typically strict prudential portfolio \nrequirements that restrict bond holdings to issues with minimum specified investment grades. \n \n9.  At  present,  with  Shanghai  Water  Assets  Operation  and  Development  Commission \n(SWAOD)\u2014the only major urban water utility company to be seriously considered by NRDC for \nbond  approval\u2014the  path  for  a  transparent  approval  process  for  local  government  utility \ncompany bond issues in the PRC is unclear. Thus, there is a critical need to carefully prepare \nanother major pilot project in this sector, not only to incorporate lessons learned from the \nSWAOD model and improve on it, but also to use the Nanjing example as a means of engaging \nin further dialogue with central Government regulatory authorities regarding official and unofficial \napproval criteria. With transparent criteria established and the factors influencing probability of \napproval better understood, an increasing number of other major urban utilities in the PRC could \nhave the incentive to invest in highly professional upstream preparation of corporate utility bond \nissues. \n \n10.  The proposed TA is consistent with ADB\u2019s PRC Country Strategy and Program (2004\u2013\n2006)8  to assist in the development of an enabling environment for private sector development \nand facilitation of efficient markets. \n                                                 \n4   Fitch Ratings. 2004 Water and Sewer Revenue Rating Guidelines 13 April.

This advisory TA will develop sustainable access of Nanjing utilities to private long-term \ncapital finance markets. The objectives of the TA are to (i) assist in management structuring, \ndevelopment of corporate governance best practices,  and overall capacity building for NWSG \nas a  newly formed integrated water utility; (ii) support the development of NWSG\u2019s accounting \nand  auditing  practices  consistent  with  best  international  practices;  (iii)  assist  NWSG  in \ndeveloping  a  management,  planning,  and  financial  information  documentation  system \nnecessary  for  initial  and  ongoing  interface  with  credit  rating  agencies;  (iv)  increase  the \ntransparency of approval procedures for future utility bond issuers through ongoing dialogue \nbetween Nanjing bond issuer and central Government agencies; and (v) structure a utility bond \nissuance for distribution to a multiple and diversified private investor base. The TA will also \nsupport the financial management and overall capacity of NCIC/NPUC. The TA will build on the \nexperience of work in Shanghai by SWAOD, particularly in its development of a long-term \ncapital financing strategy including utility revenue bond issuance. Dialogue and cooperation with \nthe  US  Trade  Development  Agency  (USTDA)  will  examine  the  lessons  learned  from  the \nSWAOD model. The TA will contribute to the building of a private market credit culture, which \nrecognizes  and  rewards  local  government  utility  companies  able  to  consistently  transmit \nprofessionally assembled transparent information to credit rating agencies and markets. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will have three components: capacity building for the newly formed integrated \nwater utility (component A), sustainable credit rating agency interface (component B), and \nsupport for implementation of a long-term capital finance plan with focus on preparing a pilot \nbond issue (component C). \n \n13.  Component  A  will  assist  in  developing  the  management  and  corporate  governance \nstructure for the new integrated utility company. Major emphasis will be given to a transparent \nfinancial reporting system with the objective of producing audited financial statements in line \nwith international standards for NWSG and other relevant subsidiaries within the NCIC group. \nAs part of an overall corporate governance structure, sustainable measures such as transfer \npricing mechanisms and detailed expenditure allocation would be developed to support the \nindependent management and operations of NWSG and NPUC.   \n \n14.  Component B will assist in developing a system of commercial planning and financial \ndiscipline  associated  with  third-party  credit  rating  agency  analysis  undertaken  in  line  with \ninternational best practices. At an early stage, focus will be on feedback to NWSG and NPUC \nunder an informal \"shadow\" credit rating process, using one or more of three top tier global \nrating agencies. Following such a process, NWSG and NPUC will rectify key areas identified \nduring the TA on the basis of feedback reports. It should be noted that international best \npractices  for  utility  credit  ratings  extend  to  a  wide  range  of  analysis  well  beyond  static \nmeasurement of recent financial performance.9 Finally, NWSG and NPUC will be assisted in \npreparing an initial package of presentation materials for formal rating agency application. It is \nexpected that separate ratings will be sought on the independent credit strength of NWSG and \n                                                 \n9  For example, Fitch Ratings. Water and Sewer Revenue Rating Guidelines. New York.

The TA will support the credit rating process for NWSG and NPUC only, and not \nextending to the credit rating attached to the credit of a bank guarantor.  \n \n15.  Component C recognizes the importance of using an incentive-based philosophy, in \nwhich progress that was made in earlier components of the assignment would lead the TA to \nsupport, in its final stage the execution of detailed commercial and legal arrangements for \nborrowing.  The  TA  will  assist  in  policy  dialogue  at  the  central  Government  level  on  the \nnecessary legal clarifications on bond security issues and other matters related to approval of \nbond issuance and potential exchange listing. Other tasks will include development of bond \nlegal documentation and clear definition of security rights vis-\u00e0-vis other existing and future \ncreditors. \n \n16.  Components  A,  B,  and  C  are  expected  to  be  undertaken  sequentially.  However, \ndialogue with rating agencies under component B and central Government approval entities \nunder component C will be required at an early stage of the TA. To assess the results of the TA \nactivities, a series of performance indicators and milestones will be established as a baseline at \nthe start of the TA and will be monitored throughout its duration.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $690,000 equivalent, comprising $243,000 in \nforeign exchange and $447,000 equivalent in local currency. The Government has requested \nADB to finance the entire foreign exchange cost and $307,000 equivalent of the  local currency \ncost, amounting to $550,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed by ADB on a grant basis from \nADB's TA funding program; $110,000 of ADB funding will be provided by the ADB Cooperation \nFund for the Water Sector. The Government will finance the balance of the local currency cost \nequivalent  to  $140,000,  through  the  provision  of  office  accommodation,  local  transport, \ncounterpart staff, workshops, and payment in part of certain credit rating fees. The detailed cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The Executing Agency for the TA is NCIC.  The NCIC will establish a project office to \nhouse the consultants and administrative support funded under the TA. The NCIC will designate \nan individual to coordinate with the consultants and will set up a steering committee to provide \nguidance and oversee the implementation of the TA.  \n \n19.  The TA will be implemented by an international consulting firm over a period of 12 \nmonths,  starting  in  September  2005  and  ending  in  September  2006.  The  TA  will  require \napproximately  22  person-months  of  consulting  services  in  the  accounting  and  legal  fields, \ninstitutional  capacity  building,  preparation  for  approvals,  and  engineering  review.  The \nconsultants will be recruited through an international firm (about 10 person-months international \nand 12 domestic). The international firm will associate with a domestic firm that is officially \nqualified to prepare corporate bond issuance applications in the PRC. The domestic firm will \nserve as principal interlocutor with NCIC and government approval authorities with respect to \ntasks in the terms of reference directly relating to the bond approval process. Rating agency \nservices will be contracted separately using a direct selection process.10 One of the international \nconsultants will be the team leader, responsible for all aspects of TA implementation. The \n                                                 \n10  Rating should be undertaken, if possible, by one of the three top global municipal ratings firms via their existing or \nto-be-established PRC subsidiaries. The limitation to these three leading firms provides the rationale for direct \nselection. \n ", "6   \nquality-based selection (QBS) method will be used in recruiting consultants because of the \nmultidisciplinary nature and complexity of the required tasks, and alternative methods and mix \nof expert skills for carrying out the TA. Noting this, along with the fact that this is a relatively new \nTA sector for ADB, relatively few qualified consultants are expected to bid for this type of work \nand there is a genuine risk that a cost-based approach would lead to the selection of a firm that \nwould be inappropriate for the assignment. QBS will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants, and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for selecting \ndomestic consultants. Outline terms of reference for consulting services are in Appendix 3. All \nprocurement under the TA will be in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for Procurement. \n \n20.  Reports will include an inception report including the work plan and key milestones (at \nthe end of month 1) and quarterly progress reports, culminating in a final report at the end of the \nTA. A number of special activity reports will be prepared, based on inputs from specialists and \nconsultants. They will be referenced and included in the progress and final reports. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of \n$110,000 to be financed by the Cooperation Fund for the Water Sector on a grant basis, and (ii) \nADB providing the balance not exceeding the equivalent of $440,000 on a grant basis, to the \nGovernment of the People's Republic of China, for the purpose of the Nanjing Water Utility \nLong-Term Capital Finance in Commercial Markets, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "  Appendix 1  7 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData Sources/ \nPerformance Targets/  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Reporting \nIndicators  Risks \nMechanisms \n       \nImpact       \n       \nFinancial independence of sub- Pilot bond issue by Nanjing  Technical Assistance  Assumption \nsovereign infrastructure entities  utility company for  (TA) completion  Market deregulation will \nand water utilities to access  replication in other cities  review  allow bond purchasers \nbond markets  (2006\u20132008  to give lower interest \n  rates to better run \nutilities that prepare \nbond issues \nprofessionally. \n       \nOutcome       \n       \nSustainable long-term access to  International credit rating is  Formal rating  Assumption \nNanjing utilities of private long- satisfied with accounting  notification from  National Development \nterm capital finance markets,  standards being used and  international agency  and Reform \nwhich will provide predictable  with corporate governance/  including satisfactory  Commission (NDRC), \nfinancial resources to fund timely  management practices  report language on  regulatory authorities, \ncapital improvement to support   (2006/ 2007).  financial reporting,  and investor market \nthe delivery of water and    governance and  require high-quality \nwastewater services to  management   utility ratings. \ncustomers     \n  Risk \nOfficials in-charge of \npreparation for future \nbond issues may not \nreplicate initial pilot \nproject process. \n \nOutputs       \n       \nComponent A: Capacity       \nBuilding for Newly Integrated       \nWater Utility and Bond Issuer       \n       \n1.

Preparing Sustainable Credit Rating Process (Component B)  \n3.   The consultants will carry out these specific tasks: \n(i)  Work with one or more rating agencies selected by ADB to provide shadow \nratings for NWSG and NPUC. Shadow rating will be undertaken individually for \neach of the two entities.   \n(ii)  Develop a database\u2014as a supplement to financial statements\u2014that can be used \nfor a comprehensive rating agency package for presenting information. Include \ninformation  on  the  local  economy,  utility  customer  base,  management, \nemployees, and other key areas. For documents of information disclosure, draw \non one or more templates using best practices from other countries. \n(iii)  Assuming  a  utility  revenue  finance  structure  for  NWSG,  assess  water  and \nwastewater tariff and connection fee structures to ensure that resulting revenue \nprojections  can realistically cover estimated operating and maintenance costs, \ndepreciation, and required debt service coverage ratios .

Explore  the  basis  for \nlimited self-insurance options to be incorporated into covenants. \n(v)  Explore a limited range of foreign currency bond issuance options. Provide a \nbrief memorandum on costs and benefits of such options as well as risks and \nrewards. Given the domestic currency revenue stream of NWSG and NPUC and \nresulting currency mismatch risk, the rationale for onshore or offshore foreign \ncurrency would need to be strong to be seriously considered. \n(vi)  Work with NWSG to develop basic elements of a plan to diversify its borrowing \nsources, obtain a target average life for overall debt amortization and to achieve \na target ratio between fixed and floating rate debt composition for NWSG. Include \nsuch a plan within rating agency presentations. \n(vii)  Assist  NWSG  and  NPUC  in  preparing  information  packages  for  such  rating \nagencies and in answering follow-up inquiries. \n(viii)  Develop a comprehensive list of utility revenue bond covenants for both NWSG \ndrawing on global experience of utilities able to achieve investment grade or \nbetter  credit  ratings.

Pilot Project Preparation (Component C) \n4.  The consultants will carry out these specific tasks: \n \n(i)  With the background of the Shanghai Water Assets Operation and Development \nCommission  (SWAOD)  utility  bond  issue  currently  in  the  final  stages  of \npreparation,  review  the  relevant  existing  primary  legislation  and  subordinate \n(administrative) regulations at the national, provincial, and municipal levels for \nNWSG bond issuance to identify impediments to international structures for utility \nrevenue  bonds  in  the  commercial  finance  markets.  Develop  alternative \nmechanisms to address areas where legal and regulatory changes do not appear \nto be viable within the next 1\u20132 years. \n(ii)  Review the impediments (if any) to the following classification of bond buyers: (a) \ncommercial banks, (b) pension funds (either directly or through fund managers), \n(c) insurance companies, and (d) trust fund intermediaries for institutional and \nindividual  retail  buyers.  As  buyers  from  all  these  classifications  are  already \ninvesting in corporate bonds, the likely impediments would appear to relate to \ncredit restrictions.  \n(iii)  Assist  in  (a)  applications  for  bond  approval  from  National  Development  and \nReform Commission (NDRC) and (b) applications for listing from the Shanghai \nStock  Exchange,  the  Interbank  Exchange,  and  other  relevant  bond  market \nexchanges. Explore alternatives to any requirements for full bank guarantees in \ndiscussions with NDRC. \n(iv)  Draft  a  risk  matrix  for  NWSG.  Assess  risks  on  upstream  and  downstream \ncontractual  arrangements  including  build\u2013operate\u2013transfer  (BOT)  treatment \nservice providers. \n(v)  Once  the  basic  bond  structure  and  schedule  have  been  determined,  NCIC, \nNPUC, and ADB would jointly determine whether or not ADB private sector \noperations can add net value to the subject bond issue via use of one or more of \nits financial instruments, with assumption of credit risk on part of the bond issue. \nTo ensure the above parties have full detailed information for such discussions, \nmake  an  independent  assessment  to  rank  and  prioritize  the  value-added \nfunctions of each type of ADB instrument, i.e. partial credit guarantees, purchase \nof bonds. Examples of value-added functions would be broadening of types of \ninvestor classes, acceptance of new security structures, and access to fixed rate \nfinancing, tenor extension, and risk mitigation. The consultant must include cost-\neffectiveness as one of key criteria in analysis. \n(vi)  Support the preparation of information disclosure documentation necessary for \nfinal official presentations to credit rating agencies, potential underwriters, and \nprivate investors. \n(vii)  Support detailed legal and financial structuring of bond issuance including terms \nsheet development, bond documentation, and security documentation. Ensure \nthat  debt  maturity  and  amortization  are  set  according  to  NWSG  financial \nobjectives and not simply as a reaction to investor demand.  \n(viii)  Suggest criteria and means of selecting debt arrangers/underwriters. Within the \nselection process qualifications should include the ability to attract a multiple \ndiversified bond investor group for future utility bond issues in Nanjing and the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China as a whole.  \n(ix)  Assist in detailed implementation of bond closing. For the sake of clarification, \nthe TA will not cover costs of bond underwriting or regulatory approvals. \n \n ", "14  Appendix 3 \n5.
