The Poverty Reduction Strategy and the Report on the Redesign of ADB\u2019s Operational \nBusiness Processes, both issued in 1999, and the Long-Term Strategic Framework, 2001, all \nnote the importance of participatory approaches for enhancing the impact of Asian Development \nBank (ADB) activities. They build on the Framework for Incorporating Participatory Processes \ninto Bank Operations, December 1996. Staff members who received funding under regional \ntechnical assistance (TA 5692 and 5894)1 found participatory activities to be beneficial and cost \neffective, and called attention to the need for more training for all stakeholders in the RETA \nevaluation studies. Capacity building has been prioritized in the recent Poverty Reduction \nStrategy review, as well. Special evaluation studies by the Operations Evaluation Department \n(OED) in 2000 and 2003 pointed to the need for enhanced knowledge and skills in participation \nto optimize its benefits2. Representatives of resident missions who attended a participation \nworkshop in headquarters in November 2002 were emphatic about the need for participation \ntraining in their countries. This TA is a direct response to policy initiatives, stated demand, and \nlessons learned from evaluation of participation activities in the past several years. \n \n2.  ADB proposes TA to build the capacity of selected developing member country (DMC) \npersonnel for pro-poor, participatory approaches in (i) project design and implementation, and \n(ii) strategy development. The TA was endorsed for funding by the Cooperation Fund in Support \nof the Formulation and Implementation of National Poverty Reduction Strategies and by the \nPoverty Reduction Cooperation Fund in July 2003. This regional TA will build on previous \nsuccessful experience with in-house training in participatory development while expanding the \nscope  to  include  DMC  stakeholders  in  up  to  10  countries  (part  A).  It  will  also  support \nparticipatory  strategy  development  in  2  DMCs  (part  B).  The  TA  has  been  prepared  in \nconsultation with selected ADB staff in headquarters and resident missions. The TA framework \nis in Appendix 1.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Among ADB\u2019s partners in DMCs, lack of sufficient experience with planning participatory \nprocesses for projects that engage a full range of stakeholders appropriately (in light of existing \ncapacity, contextual factors, etc.) affects project quality and may contribute to slowdowns during \nimplementation.  Similarly,  limited  experience  with  employing  participation  during  strategy \ndevelopment, whether for country strategy and program (CSP), program, sector development \nprogram, or sectorwide approach (SWAp) lending, or national sector or thematic strategies, \ntypically means less efficient implementation of new strategies. This situation continues (i) \ndespite  the  realization  that  project  designs  that  include  participatory  approaches  in  both \nplanning and implementation are associated with greater impacts (for example, participation, \nwhen conducted well and sustained through time, has been shown to be the single most \nimportant factor in project success in rural water supply projects4); and (ii) despite recognition \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 1996 and 1999.

There is lack of clarity about the scope for applying participatory tools and expected \noutcomes of their use. They may be used in communities for assessments or for planning and \nmanaging activities. They may also be used in far more complex design and management \nprocesses involving diverse institutions to create project goals and plans for implementation and \nmonitoring. Though the participatory approaches applied at each institutional level and at each \nstage of a development activity are based on the same principles (of respect, flexibility, shared \nlearning, etc.), specific tools may differ for distinct groups of stakeholders with contrasting \ninstitutional capacity, for different types of decisions, and in varying contexts.   \n \n5.  DMC partners and stakeholders also need to be clear about distinctions among basic \nmodes of participation. These are information sharing and gathering activities; consultation  \n(which  is  generally  regarded  as  limited  participation);  and  more  collaborative  forms  of \ninteraction, such as consensus building and participatory approaches to monitoring, budgeting, \nand conflict management, that empower both citizens and members of organizations, foster \nsocial capital, and contribute to institutional capacity enhancement. Choosing the best mode of \nparticipation for decision making with particular stakeholders, during design or implementation \nof a project or strategy development process, requires understanding of the alternatives, their \napplications including resource requirements, and the implications for the outcomes of activities.    \n \n6.  Whether participatory approaches are employed only at the community level or in a \nhierarchy of institutions, and during design or implementation or both, support is required to \nfollow through on all the planned activities. For example, local nongovernment organizations \n(NGOs) that are expected to lead participatory exercises will need some training to ensure that \nthey share an understanding of the project and use the same methods; and officials in the \ndistrict or provincial governments who oversee the work may require enhanced capacity to fulfill \nthe roles they are expected to play in support of local decision making. To achieve the greatest \npoverty  reduction  impacts,  support  for  sustained  engagement  of  stakeholders  in  decision \nmaking,  especially  through  monitoring  their  own  progress  in  projects  or  in  implementing \nstrategies they developed together, is needed. The requirements of time, finance, and skills \nmust be assessed early, and plans must be adapted to fit the social and institutional context.      \n \n7.  Communication  among  ADB  staff,  including  those  in  resident  missions,  and  DMC \npartners and other stakeholders on the above issues in participatory planning and management \n(tools, modes of participation, institutional levels, phase of project, and follow-through) is crucial \nto improving the quality of ADB work and effectively reducing poverty. Enhancing the skills of \nlocal facilitators for working at multiple levels and with various stakeholder groups is another key \nto  promoting  participatory  development  and  to  ensuring  more  effective  and  cost-efficient \nprojects and strategy development activities. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n8.  The purpose of the TA is to help DMC stakeholders comprehend and successfully \nemploy pro-poor participatory approaches in ADB projects or in strategy development activities \n                                                 \n5 Brinkerhoff, D.

The output of the training component (part A), will be that DMC partners in \ngovernment,  other  DMC  stakeholders,  project  team  members  (as  resource  persons),  and \nconsultants,  will  learn  about  options,  benefits,  and  requirements  for  applying  participatory \napproaches to improve poverty reduction impact of projects, and be able to select appropriate \nparticipatory approaches and tools and include these in their work. In the strategy development \ncomponent (part B) participatory processes for strategy development will be designed and \nfacilitated; consensus on major issues will be reached, local facilitator-trainees will be coached; \nand lessons identified and shared. Indicators for evaluating the impact of the participatory \nprocess  on  strategy  implementation  will  also  be  defined.  Evaluation  (part  C)  and  a  final \nworkshop will generate recommendations for scaling up this training and strategy development \neffort to further disseminate learning and enhance poverty reduction in ADB projects. It will \nfocus on the impact of skills development and capacity building on the participants, draw \ncomparisons with similar cases in which participatory approaches were not employed, and \nprovide case studies for future training and discussions.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  Part A involves relevant, immediately applicable (\u201cjust-in-time\u201d) 3-day training workshops \nwith a range of DMC partners and other stakeholders in government, civil society, and the \nprivate sector, who are working together on an ADB-supported project, or are key to ADB-\nsupported activities in the DMC more generally. ADB resident mission staff, representatives of \ninternational  funding  agencies,  and  resource  persons  from  the  project  teams  at  ADB \nheadquarters will also attend. The workshops will be held in the relevant borrowing country. No \nactivities will be financed and no consultants will be fielded in countries that have not expressed \nprior agreement through provision of no-objection letters. Projects at early stages of design are \npreferred, but projects at early stages of implementation may also be included. Selection criteria \nstress the interest of the project team and regional department, specific features of the projects \nsuch as emphasis on participation, and practical considerations like availability of facilities and \npersonnel at the appropriate time. Efforts will be made to ensure that workshops are offered in a \nwide  range  of  sectors  and  countries.  Highly  qualified  trainers  will  introduce  fundamental \nconcepts of participatory development, stakeholder analysis, institutional and context analyses, \nparticipation  planning,  and  a  small  number  of  tools  and  methods.  Preparing  budgets  for \nparticipatory activities, terms of reference (TORs) for facilitators, and indicators for monitoring \nthe efficacy of participation will be covered to the extent feasible. The training will build on highly \nrated workshops at ADB headquarters in 2002 and 2003.  \n \n10.  Additional workshops may be scheduled to cover tools and methods for community- and \ninstitutional-level  research,  planning,  monitoring,  etc.  in  greater  depth.  Examples  include \nparticipatory learning and action/participatory rural appraisal; strength-weakness-opportunity-\nthreat (or challenge) analysis; force field analysis; appreciative inquiry; and varying approaches \nto facilitating large meetings or workshops. It is hoped there will be opportunities for working \nwith poor citizens in these workshops.  Another option is a follow-up workshop for participants in \na basic workshop who desire more advanced training or coaching. Though this is expected to \nbe less common than the introductory and tool workshops, the trainers will accommodate this \ndemand whenever feasible. In all workshops, a local facilitator-trainee will be sought to work \nwith the lead trainers to improve the local trainee\u2019s skills through exposure to new training \nmethods and target groups.      \n \n ", "4    \n11.  Part B of the TA will build capacity in using participatory approaches to developing \nstrategies, including planning their implementation. Support will be offered to two countries in \nconnection  with  CSP  preparation;  strategy  development  related  to  program,  sector \ndevelopment,  or  SWAp  lending;  or  national  sector  or  thematic  strategy  development  or \nimplementation.  Interest  among  country  or  project  team  members  and  their  regional \ndepartments, plus suitability of the specific activity and its context will be the selection criteria. \nSelection will be  made in consultation with the regional departments. No activities will be \nfinanced and no consultants will be fielded in countries that have not expressed prior agreement \nthrough provision of no-objection letters. For each strategy development initiative, one highly \nqualified international consultant will be hired for 3.5 person-months to help DMC partners plan \na process for building consensus among appropriate stakeholder groups (such as poor and \nexcluded citizens, plus government officials, NGOs and other civil society organizations, and \nprivate sector actors  \u2013 all at local, district, provincial, and national levels). In a series of \nparticipatory meetings or workshops, stakeholders will analyze the existing situation, the policy \nenvironment, institutional  capacities, issues of particular relevance to citizens, and various \noptions to formulate recommendations for both the strategy and its implementation. The final \nevents in the series will synthesize the recommendations into an integrated strategy proposal \nand  implementation  plan.  Four  domestic  facilitator-trainees,  two  in  each  country,  will  be \nengaged to work with the international consultant to practice and improve their facilitation skills \nand to gain experience in planning a collaborative strategy development process. They will work \nfor  up  to  6  months  each  and  may  be  offered  additional  training  at  institutions  that  offer \nappropriate workshops, preferably within the region.   \n \n12.  The  international  consultant  will  ensure  that  participants  at  all  levels,  and  key \nstakeholders such as central Government officials, stay informed about the process and its \noverall  results  to  maximize  shared  learning  about  applying  participation  in  strategy \ndevelopment. At the end, these key stakeholders will meet to review the process, derive lessons \nfor future strategy development activities, and develop indicators for assessing effectiveness, \nease, and speed of implementing the new strategy.   \n \n13.  Part  C,  a  critical  evaluation  of  parts  A  and  B,  will  generate  case  studies  and \nrecommendations  for  building  capacity  for  participatory  development  in  ADB  projects  and \nstrategy development initiatives. An international consultant will work for 2.5 person-months to \nreview documentation and meet with participants in parts A and B and other stakeholders at \nlocal to national levels in selected countries to assess the processes, learning, outcomes, and \nproposals for future activities. Where feasible, the consultant will develop comparisons with \nsimilar cases that did not use participatory approaches. The consultant will help facilitate and \npresent the preliminary report and recommendations for future ADB operations at a workshop in \nADB headquarters. The consultant will prepare the final report based on discussions at the \nworkshop. Results of the evaluation study, case studies, and training materials \u2013 in regional \nlanguages as well as English \u2013 will be disseminated both electronically and in hard copy.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $600,000 equivalent. The TA will be funded on a \ngrant basis by the Cooperation Fund in Support of the Formulation and Implementation of \nNational Poverty Reduction Strategies and by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund. Each \nwill contribute $300,000 equivalent. ADB will administer the TA. The detailed cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \n ", "                 5\nD.       Implementation Arrangements \n15.  In  the  training  component,  relevant  stakeholders  in  the  national  and  regional \ngovernments, civil society, and the private sector in a DMC, plus ADB resource persons from \nthe project teams (in headquarters) and resident missions, and representatives of international \nfunding agencies, will be invited to attend 3-day workshops in the borrowing country. Projects \nwill  be  selected  in  consultation  with  the  regional  departments  and  project  teams,  and \nparticipants will be selected based on discussions with the project team and resident mission \nstaff about the candidates\u2019 connection with ADB-supported projects. The workshops will focus \non projects on which the participants are working and cover fundamental dimensions of pro-\npoor  participatory  development.  Additional  workshops  will  focus  on  tools  and  methods  or \nprovide follow-up support to a group that requests additional inputs. One international firm will \nbe selected and engaged on the basis of the quality and cost-based selection method using a \nbiodata proposal. The firm will be responsible for all workshops. It will send one international \nfacilitator-trainer  and  one  assistant  facilitator-trainer  (preferably  from  the  region)  to  each \nworkshop, and also invite or hire a domestic facilitator-trainee when feasible.     \n \n16.  In the strategy development component, one highly qualified individual international \nconsultant will be hired in each country to work with DMC stakeholders for 3.5 person-months. \nThe consultant will coordinate with others who are involved with planning or implementing the \ninitiative, and will have a role in selecting two domestic facilitators-in-training, guide and give \nthem opportunities for practice, involve them in planning and managing the overall process, and \npossibly deputize them to carry out local consultations or other activities for some time between \nthe consultant\u2019s (possible) two separate trips to the country. Thus, each domestic facilitator-\ntrainee may work for up to 6 months.   \n \n17.    One international consultant with appropriate expertise will be hired for 2.5 person-\nmonths to evaluate the capacity building efforts under this TA, develop recommendations for \nfuture  improvements  and  expansion  of  the  initiative,  assist  with  the  workshop  at  ADB \nheadquarters, and prepare the final report and case studies. All consultants will be selected and \nengaged by ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for selecting and engaging domestic consultants.   \n18.  The final report including recommendations after discussion and possible revision at the \nworkshop, plus case studies and training materials, will be processed, edited, and translated \ninto selected regional languages, and disseminated in both electronic and hard copy formats.  \nThe TA will be implemented from 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2006.   \n \n19.    The  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA  is  ADB  through  the  Regional  and  Sustainable \nDevelopment Department, Poverty Reduction and Social Development Division.   \n \n \nIII.

Training Component \n1.  One international firm will be hired to lead 10 workshops in various countries. One highly \nskilled participatory development trainer with knowledge of ADB operations and the Asia Pacific \nregion, working with a co-facilitator, preferably from within the region, will lead 3-day workshops \non participatory development covering fundamental concepts; stakeholder, institutional, and \ncontext analysis; participation planning; and introduction of a few tools. Budgeting, TORs, \nmonitoring, and indicators will be included, as feasible.  DMC stakeholders in government, civil \nsociety, and the private sector who are working on an ADB-supported project \u2013 preferably early \nin the design phase but perhaps early in implementation as well \u2013 will focus on the tasks on \nwhich they are working together.  Alternate forms of workshops focus on tools and methods, \nand provide follow-up training for groups that request special coaching after taking part in an \nintroductory workshop.   \n   \n2.   Resource persons from the project teams in ADB headquarters and resident missions \nwill participate in the workshops, as required.  Representatives of international aid organizations \nmay also attend.   \n \n3.  A local facilitator-trainee will be invited or hired to work with the international and \nregional facilitators in each country to build his/her capacity. \n \n4.  The trainers will keep records on each workshop, solicit evaluations from participants at \nthe close of each workshop, and submit a final report on the work, including recommendations \nfor future training on participatory development in the region.   \nB.  Strategy Development Component  \n5.  The  technical  assistance  will  require  the  services  of  international  and  domestic \nconsultants.  Their   tasks   follow. \n \n  1.  International Consultants \n   \n6.  One international consultant for each country selected under the strategy development \ncomponent will  \n \n(i)  work closely with key stakeholders in the country for 3.5 person-months (possibly  \ndivided into two trips no more than 3 months apart) to plan and facilitate a \nparticipatory strategy design process for a country strategy and program; a \nprogram, sector development or sectorwide loan; or a national sector or thematic \nstrategy;  \n \n(ii)  ensure that stakeholders, relevant existing policies and the institutional context  \nare analyzed so that participants can assess the affects of various strategy \nalternatives on individuals and groups; \n \n(iii)  make sure that all relevant groups are represented in the strategy development  \n ", "Appendix 3            15   \nprocess, and organize and lead a series of participatory consensus-building \nworkshops  to  develop  recommendations  for  a  pro-poor  strategy  and  its \nimplementation;   \n \n(iv)  ensure that participants receive feedback about how their suggestions have been  \nincorporated into the final recommendations;   \n \n(v)  assist  in  selecting  two  domestic  facilitators.    The  consultant  will  coach  the \nfacilitators and may delegate leadership of some constituent consensus-building \nsessions to them (especially between the [possible] two trips by the international \nconsultant), evaluate their work, and recommend whether one or both should be \ngiven additional facilitation training preferably within the region;   \n \n(vi)  facilitate a review process with key stakeholders at the end of the engagement to  \nevaluate the activities undertaken, derive lessons for future strategy development \nefforts, and identify indicators for assessing the effectiveness, ease, and speed \nof implementing the new policy; and \n \n(vii)  keep records of all planning meetings, workshops and other participatory events,  \nand of the final review process; and prepare a comprehensive and reflective final \nreport of the processes undertaken.  If the consultant divides his or her time into \ntwo  visits  to  the  country,  clear  instructions  must  be  left  for  actions  to  be \nundertaken by the facilitator-trainees during his or her absence and a midterm \nreport submitted within 1 week of departure at the end of the first phase of the \nwork.   \n \n2.  Domestic Consultants \n \n7.  In each of the two selected countries, two facilitators will work with the international \nconsultant.  They will assist with all phases of the design and execution of the planning process \nfor participatory strategy development and implementation.  Each may work for up to 6 months.  \nThey will practice and improve their skills as facilitators and learn to apply them to strategy \ninitiatives under the supervision of the international consultant and may accept responsibility for \nleading some of the workshops. They will help with local arrangements, planning and managing \nthe workshops, taking notes and preparing summaries, correspondence with stakeholders at all \nlevels, and maintaining positive relationships with all stakeholders.  They may also be asked to \ncontribute in preparing the final report.   \n \n8.  The facilitators may be nominated for additional international training in facilitation based \non their performance and the assessment  of the international consultant of their skills and \ncommitment to participatory processes.    \n  \nC.  Evaluation Component    \n9.  One international consultant will be hired for 2.5 months to critically examine both the \nstrategy  development  and  training  components;  assess  the  effectiveness  of  processes, \nlearning, and outcomes; identify opportunities for improvement; and formulate recommendations \nfor further development of these or related initiatives.  The consultant will review documents and \nvisit selected countries to meet with participants in both components and other stakeholders \nfrom  local  to  national  level.    The  consultant  will  develop  case  studies  and,  as  feasible, \n ", "16  Appendix 3   \ncomparisons  with  similar  projects  or  strategy  development  activities  where  participatory \napproaches were not used.   \n \n10.  The consultant will help present a preliminary report of his or her findings in a final \nworkshop  at  ADB  headquarters  where  staff  and  selected  representatives  of  participating \ncountries  will  present  their  experiences  and  review  and  further  develop  the  evaluation \nconsultant\u2019s recommendations. The consultant will also help facilitate the workshop.  After the \nworkshop, the consultant will prepare the final report.  \n \nD.    Publication and Dissemination  \n \n11.
