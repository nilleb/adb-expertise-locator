INTRODUCTION \n \n1.    The Pacific developing member countries (DMCs)1 of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)  are  among  the  most  vulnerable  nations  threatened  by  climate  change.  The  Pacific \nIslands Forum leaders have long recognized that climate change is a priority development issue, \nand a concerted global effort will have to be taken to halt, or at least slow down, the onset of \nclimate change as articulated in the 2008 Niue Declaration on Climate Change. The Pacific \nDMCs have begun to mainstream climate change considerations into their national policies and \nplanning processes, and have requested technical and financial assistance from ADB, in the \ncourse of their consultations during the preparation of the country partnership strategies (CPSs) \nand country operations business plans (COBPs),2 to enable them to take the process further. At \nthe  19th  Pacific  DMCs  Governors  Meeting, the  Pacific DMC  governors  requested  ADB  to \nconsider establishing a regional climate change fund to support programs and projects aimed at \nstrengthening  adaptation  measures  prioritized  by  the  Pacific  DMCs. 3  The  ADB  Pacific \nDepartment (PARD) has responded positively, with a commitment to provide a broad spectrum \nof  assistance  in  implementing  national  plans  for  climate  change  adaptation  and  mitigation \nthrough  the  Climate  Change  Implementation  Plan  (CCIP)  for  the  Pacific,4 and  to  work  in \nconjunction  with  other  international  and  intergovernmental  plans  to  tackle  climate  change \nimpacts.5 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.6  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Most Pacific DMCs are characterized by their small physical size and geographical \nremoteness, fragile biodiversity, and exposure to natural hazards\u2014making them among the \nmost environmentally vulnerable nations in the world. The well-being of the Pacific DMCs is \nthreatened by the impacts of climate change. Sea-level rise and extreme climate events are \nalready exacerbating inundation, storm surge, erosion, and other coastal hazards, thus putting \nat  risk  vital  infrastructure,  settlements,  and  facilities  that  support  the  livelihood  of  island \ncommunities. Pacific DMCs lack adequate resilience to absorb the economic shocks attributed \nto  climate  impacts.  Constraints  include  low  human,  financial,  and  technical  capacity;  poor \ncoordination between numerous donors operating in the region; and the limited availability of \nscientific information. Already, natural hazards impose significant economic costs on Pacific \nDMC economies. In the 1990s alone, reported natural disasters cost the region $2.8 billion.7  \n                                                 \n1  The 14 Pacific DMCs are the Cook Islands, the Fiji Islands, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of \nMicronesia, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Tuvalu, and \nVanuatu. \n2  The government agencies involved in discussions with ADB on climate change during the CPS and COBP process \ninclude the finance and environment ministries, climate change focal person and/or institutions, and disaster risk \nmanagement focal point and/or institution, among others. Pacific DMCs have been consulted on the impact, \noutcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, costs, financing arrangements, and terms of reference of the TA. \n3  Letter to the ADB President from P. Pruaitch, governor for Papua New Guinea and chair of the 19th Pacific DMCs \nGovernors Meeting with ADB Management , dated 5 May 2009. \n4   ADB. 2009. Mainstreaming Climate Change in ADB Operations: Climate Change Implementation Plan for the \nPacific (2009\u20142015). Manila. CCIP also provides an overview of regional climate and related initiatives in the \nPacific, covering both adaptation and mitigation projects and programs by Australia, Canada, European Union, \nGlobal Environment Facility, Japan, New Zealand, United Nations Development Programme, and World Bank, \namong others. \n5  Through ADB support, Palau has already prepared its climate change action plan, and ADB has committed to \nsupporting  the  Government  and  other  national  stakeholders  to  develop  a  multilevel  cluster  of  activities  to \nimplement the Government\u2019s national adaptation action plan. \n6  The technical assistance (TA) first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 25 July \n2009. \n7  World Bank. 2006. Not If But When: Adapting to Natural Hazards in the Pacific Islands Region. Washington, DC. \n ", "2 \n \n3.  Since the granting of the first regional technical assistance (TA) on climate change for \nthe Pacific in 2003, ADB is continuing to support the Pacific DMCs through a number of climate \nchange initiatives. These include (i) preparation of climate risk profiles, (ii) guidelines for climate \nproofing of infrastructure projects, (iii) assessing feasibility for catastrophe risk financing (jointly \nwith  the  World  Bank),  and  (iv)  preparation  of  the  CCIP.8 Enhancement  of  private  sector \nparticipation in financing adaptation, support for best practice in adaptation at the sectoral level, \npreparation and trial of climate risk reduction tools for screening pipeline projects, and ensuring \nthat climate-related risks and vulnerability are adequately reflected in the CPSs of the Pacific \nDMCs are some of the challenges faced by Pacific DMCs, ADB, and development partners. \nUnder the ADB work plan and budget framework 2010\u20132012, many of the projects proposed by \nPARD in the transport and ICT, and energy sectors will require climate-adaptive components \nsuch  as  climate  proofing  and  provision  for  alternative  freshwater  supply.  Projects  having \nclimate-proofing requirements alone will require a low of $86 million and a high of $172 million \nor an average of $130 million during 2010\u20132012. \n \n4.  Pacific DMCs currently lag the rest of the world in accessing project carbon financing \nthrough the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM).9 Material transaction costs hinder project \ndevelopment, but small-scale methodologies, bundling options, programmatic approaches, and \ngrant  financing  largely  mitigate  this  issue.  A  more  significant  barrier  has  been  the  limited \ncapacity of national governments and project developers to identify, develop, and manage CDM \nprojects. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n5.  The  proposed  regional  capacity  development  TA  will  assist  the  Pacific  DMCs  in \naddressing climate change impacts, as defined by the United Nations Framework Convention \non  Climate  Change,10 by  building  resilience  through  adaptation  to  climate  change,  climate \nvariability, and extreme weather events\u2014taking into account country-specific issues and needs \nat the local level. It will also seek to complement existing climate change activities in the region, \nincluding the Australian Adaptation to Climate Change Initiative and the Global Environment \nFacility-funded regional Pacific Adaptation to Climate Change project.11 \n \n6.  The TA is consistent with the draft Pacific Strategy, 2010\u20132014,12 which promotes the \nconcept of \u201cgreen growth\u201d in the region in line with ADB\u2019s long-term strategic framework 2008\u2013\n2020 (Strategy 2020).13 The TA will support priority climate change-related activities in Pacific \nDMCs identified in the CCIP as well as in ADB CPSs and COBPs,14 building on previous \n                                                 \n8  Relevant ADB TA projects include (i) ADB. 2002.

Manila (TA 6420-REG); (iii) ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance for Regional Partnerships for \nClimate Change Adaptation and Disaster Preparedness. Manila (TA 6496-REG). ADB is also working with the \nWorld Bank on the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience, as part of the Multilateral Development Bank Climate \nInvestment Funds. \n9  Although more than 100 viable CDM projects have been identified in the Pacific, only two registered CDM projects \nexist.

Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The TA is expected to improve the ability and resilience of the Pacific DMCs to prepare \nfor,  and  respond  to,  the  challenges  posed  by  climate  change  impacts  through  the \nimplementation  of  priority  adaptation  and  mitigation  measures.  The  TA  will  facilitate  the \ndevelopment of adequate climate change adaptation and mitigation plans among the Pacific \nDMCs, and where possible, build on and/or complement existing national adaptation plans of \naction and climate change strategies. It will (i) establish a Pacific climate change program that \naims to strengthen adaptation (e.g., climate proofing) and mitigation measures (e.g., renewable \nenergy development), and develop appropriate financing mechanisms for TA and investments in \nkey sectors of Pacific DMCs; and (ii) enhance the Pacific DMCs\u2019 capacity in (a) adopting and \nimplementing national climate change adaptation strategy and action plans, and (b) harnessing \nopportunities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through renewable energy. The outcome of \nthe TA will be the incorporation of climate risk management, adaptation practices, and mitigation \nmeasures into key sectoral investment plans and project designs (e.g., water, transport, energy, \nand agriculture). \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n8.  The TA will have three main outputs: (i) the Pacific Climate Change Program (PCCP), \n(ii) adaptation preparation in selected Pacific DMCs, and (iii) the promotion of a mitigation \nstrategy in selected Pacific DMCs and identification of mitigation projects for the CDM.  \n \n9.  Output  1:  Pacific  Climate  Change  Program. This will set the CCIP in motion by \nassisting  Pacific  DMCs  in  improving  their  resilience  to  climate  change  impacts  through \n(i) mainstreaming  of  the  adaptation  in  their  policies,  plans,  programs,  and  projects;  and \n(ii) strengthening  their  systems  and  capabilities  to  foster  the  adaptation  process,  including \ninformation and decision support tools, and access to affordable financing of climate-proofed \ndevelopment  initiatives.  The  PCCP  will  facilitate  the  systematic  implementation  of  climate-\nadaptive investment projects and TA grants as well as climate change mitigation actions in the \nPacific DMCs. It will render advice and guidance to the Pacific DMCs in the (i) development or \nstrengthening of national climate change adaptation and mitigation plans, and (ii) development \nof  capacity  to  access  funds.  These  will  be  done  by  providing,  or  improving  access  to, \ninformation and knowledge on methodological tools and guidelines for identifying vulnerable \nsectors and population groups; and developing options for adaptation and mitigation, including \neconomic costs and benefits analysis.16  \n \n10.  It will also develop mechanisms for financing the PCCP. This will include (i) assessing \nfinancing gaps, and examining grant cofinancing opportunities for TA and investments in key \nsectors covered in the PARD work program and budget framework 2010\u20132012; (ii) discussions \nand  dialogues  with  development  partners  to  identify  cofinancing  windows,  including  the \npossibility  of  establishing  a  Pacific-tailored  multi-donor  climate  change  financing  facility  for \nmobilizing dedicated resources; (iii) exploring contributions from other development partners \nactive in the Pacific region to cofinance projects of common interest within the PCCP; and \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n                                                 \n15 ADB. 2002.

Output 2: Adaptation preparation in selected Pacific DMCs. Up to five Pacific DMCs \nwill be selected, based on a set of criteria, and supported in preparing the implementation of \nclimate change adaptation plans, including further capacity building.18 This will be done initially \nby (i) facilitating the creation or supporting an existing climate change coordinating mechanism \n(e.g., focal point) to assist the Pacific DMCs in building their capacity for adaptation planning at \nnational and local levels, and (ii) reinforcing linkages among the many possible adaptation entry \npoints to contribute to a more integrated strategy. This output will comprise (i) strengthening \ninstitutional  capacity  to  prepare  and  assess  climate-oriented  environmental  assessments; \n(ii) development  of  an  information  system  for  multisector  climate  change  vulnerability  and \nadaptation (V&A) assessment;19 (iii) mainstreaming of climate risk management and adaptation \npolicies and measures;20 and (iv) design of pilot adaptation projects, based on the prior V&A \nassessment and geographic information system (GIS) mapping, in priority sectors.21  \n \n12.  Output 3: Support for Upscaling renewable energy technologies and Capacity \nBuilding for CDM and Establishment of DNAs. This output will focus on the identification and \npromotion of results-oriented mitigation projects, such as (i) identification of renewable energy \nprojects suitable for upscaling, and (ii) support for carbon trading through renewable energy \nprojects. It will comprise two sub-outputs: (i) development of renewable energy projects, and (ii) \nsupport for carbon trading through CDM capacity development. The  TA will promote clean \nenergy projects using grid connected hydropower (run-of-the-river), and grid-connected solar \npower, targeting initially two Pacific DMCs - Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) and Republic \nof Marshall Islands (RMI).22 The activities under the TA will include preparation of prefeasibility \nstudies, preparation of detailed feasibility studies for selected projects, and development of \nfinancing proposals.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost the equivalent of $3.815 million, of which (i) $1,775,000 will \nbe  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-IV); \n                                                 \n17  The PCCP will be implemented over 6 years (2010\u20132015), and continued support for PCCP implementation will be \nneeded through a phase 2 TA project.  \n18 Selection criteria may include, among others, Pacific DMCs with CPSs or COBPs prioritizing climate change \ninterventions. The scope of output 2 may be expanded through channeling of supplementary funds.   \n19 This will build on the development of a hazard risk database undertaken in selected Pacific DMCs under ADB. \n2008. Technical Assistance for Regional Partnerships for Climate Change Adaptation and Disaster Preparedness. \nManila (TA 6496-REG). \n20 Support for this will cover public awareness, stakeholder consultations, private sector involvement, and changes in \nregulatory framework (e.g., revision of building codes with reference to climate-proofing of infrastructure or \nenhancing the yearly legislated budgetary provisions to account for climate change mainstreaming activities). \n21 The priority sectors are (i) natural resources (e.g., coastal and marine resources protection and management,  \nintegrated watershed management, and building synergy between adaptation and mitigation); (ii) agriculture \n(e.g., best practices in drought and saltwater-resistant crop selection, pest management); (iii) water resources and \nwater supply and sanitation  (e.g., water harvesting techniques, integrated water resource management, urban and \nrural water supply and sanitation, solid waste management); and (iv) energy and transport infrastructure (climate-\nproofing). \n22 The scope of support under Output 3 will be expanded through channeling of supplementary funds from the Asian \nClean Energy Fund (ACEF) under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility (CEFPF) to cover additional \npriority countries such as Cook Islands, Tonga and Timor-Leste and additional technology, such as wind power. All \nthe target countries (i) are heavily dependent on diesel for power generation, (ii) have policies promoting the use of \nrenewable energy, and (iii) have requested ADB assistance for upscaling renewable power generation.  \n ", "5 \n \n(ii) $1,365,000  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Climate  Change  Fund;23 and  (iii) \n$325,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the Canadian Cooperation Fund on Climate \nChange and administered by ADB. The Pacific DMCs will contribute the equivalent of $350,000 \nin kind. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  PARD, through the Pacific Operations Division (PAHQ), will serve as the TA Executing \nAgency, and it will establish the PCCP coordination unit comprising core professional staff, \nsupport staff services and consultants for the coordination, supervision, and implementation of \nall TA activities\u2014with focus on promoting CCIP implementation and establishing linkages with \nthe  national  climate  change  focal  points  (NCCFPs)  in  the  individual  countries.  The  PCCP \ncoordination unit will also liaise with other relevant ADB units and/or offices, particularly the \nSouth  Pacific  Subregional  Office  (SPSO),  Pacific  Liaison  and  Coordination  Office  (PLCO), \nPapua  New  Guinea  Resident  Mission  (PNRM),  Special  Office  in  Timor-Leste  (SOTL),  the \nClimate Change Unit and relevant divisions in the Regional and Sustainable Development \nDepartment, Economics and Research Department, and the Office of Cofinancing Operations. \nThe TA will be implemented over 2 years from 1 October 2009 to 30 September 2011 in \ncollaboration with other programs on climate change in the region. The proceeds of the TA will \nbe disbursed in line with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook.24 Equipment will \nbe purchased in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time \nto  time)  and  will  be  handed  over  to  implementing  departments  upon  TA  completion.  The \nprogress and outputs of the TA will be shared with the Pacific DMCs and various regional \ndevelopment partners and discussed during key regional meetings, such as the Pacific Forum. \n \n15.  The TA will require the services of 48 international and 243 national consultants under \nspecific  TA  outputs.  Output  1  consultants  include:  (i)  climate  change  coordinator  and/or \nfinancing specialist and assistant coordinator, (ii) economist, and (iii) climate change modeler. \nOutput 2 consultants are composed of: (i) climate change adaptation specialist, (ii) environment \nand  natural  resources  specialists,  (iii)  infrastructure  specialist,  (iv) GIS  specialist,  (v) \ncommunication specialist, and (vi) gender specialist. Output 3 consultants include: (i) CDM \nspecialist (project manager and deputy project manager), and (ii) renewable energy specialists. \nOutput 1 consultants will be recruited on an individual basis, while outputs 2 and 3 consultants \nwill be selected through quality- and cost-based selection using a quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20 for \nevaluating simplified proposals to be requested from short-listed firms.25 Consultant selection \nwill  be  done  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as \namended from time to time).
