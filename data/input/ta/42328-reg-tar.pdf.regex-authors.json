This  regional  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA)  is  part  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB) Sustainable Transport Initiative (STI), which was created in 2006 to \nenhance ADB\u2019s transport sector interventions by incorporating energy efficiency and inclusive \ntransport  infrastructure  and  services  with  the  explicit  aim  to  reduce  transport  sector  GHG \nemissions.1 Previous STI activities have examined sustainable urban transport (SUT) in five \npilot  cities  (Harbin  and  Changzhou,  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China;  Dhaka,  Bangladesh; \nKathmandu, Nepal; and Colombo, Sri Lanka)2 and a development framework for SUT.3 These \nactivities\u2019 findings were disseminated during the September 2008 ADB Transport Forum,4 which \ngenerated  significant  interest  from  developing  member  countries  (DMCs)  toward  exploring \nmainstreaming environmentally SUT interventions into ADB\u2019s lending programs. \n \n2.  Therefore, this PPTA proposes to develop SUT programs and projects in selected DMC \ncities by implementing the findings of previous STI work.5 The cities will provide demonstration \ncases for low carbon urban transport solutions and act as a catalyst for further SUT work in \nADB\u2019s lending portfolio. The PPTA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  DMCs\u2019 transport sectors can propel poverty reduction by making economic activity, \nhealth care, education, and social development accessible and mobile. In its strategy for poverty \nreduction  and  enhanced  economic  development  across  the  region,  ADB  supports  the \ndevelopment impacts that transport provides, with the sector encompassing over 35% of ADB\u2019s \nlending portfolio.  \n4.  The sector is facing new challenges in rapidly developing Asian economies as outlined \nin  two  pillars  of  ADB\u2019s  long-term  strategic  framework  2008\u20132020  (Strategy  2020): 6  (i) \nenvironmentally sustainable growth, and (ii) inclusive economic growth. These challenges are \nespecially steep for SUT. Congestion often curtails the economic activities that cities provide to \nnational economies,7 and rapid urbanization is leading to income disparities and restricting the \nability of the urban poor to realize their full economic roles.  \n \n5.  Trends in the urban transport sector have focused on increasing physical capacity to \nalleviate congestion, often allocating additional road space to private vehicles. The end result is \nincreasingly congested and polluted cities, in which energy-efficient and inclusive nonmotorized \nand public transport\u2014the main modes of travel for the urban poor\u2014compete with private cars. It \nis estimated that around 20% of urban transport trips, which are made by private vehicles, \nreceive around 80% of the sector\u2019s investments. A new approach is needed to move goods and \nservices through integrated land use, inclusive urban transport services, and restraints to private \nvehicle use.  \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 25 September 2008. \n2  ADB. 2006.

Manila \n(TA-6416-REG). \n4  ADB Transport Forum: Asia on the Move: Energy Efficient and Inclusive Transport, September 2008, Manila. \n5  The acting director general of the Regional and Sustainable Development Department approved the concept paper \nfor the TA on 17 September 2008.  \n6 ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n7  Cities account for around 75% of many Asian economies. \n ", "2     \n6.  In addition, the traditional transport approach often ignores the environmental and health \nimpacts from pollution and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Over the past three decades, \ncarbon dioxide emissions from transport have risen faster than those from other sectors, with \nthe greatest increases seen in Asia\u2019s cities. Projections of future urban transport emissions are \nnot encouraging, and climate change impacts must now be considered an integral aspect of \ntransport policy and projects, particularly urban transport. \n \n7.  ADB\u2019s STI falls under the umbrella of its climate change program, highlighting the role of \nurban transport in climate change mitigation. The use of the Climate Change Fund for this PPTA \nshows ADB\u2019s commitment to environmentally sustainable growth of its transport sector. \n \n8.  The new approach to SUT must include the development of policies and projects that \npromote energy-efficient and inclusive urban transport modes. Three components are needed to \nmove  people  and  goods  with  the  minimum  amount  of  energy  use  and  thus  reduce  GHG \nemissions: (i) integrated land use and mobility, reducing the need for travel and shipment of \ngoods by locating places of employment, housing, and other services in livable and readily \naccessible communities; (ii) energy-efficient modes of urban transport, such as nonmotorized \ntransport, public transport, or rail-based freight, to maximize energy use and to restrain private \nvehicle use for routine trips; and (iii) improve standards of vehicle and fuel technologies through \npolicy dialogue. \n \n9.  Inclusive economic growth is also a core element of SUT, as increased congestion and \ntravel times have a direct impact on travel costs. Moreover, urban expansion means that places \nof employment are often far away from residential areas, resulting in ever higher travel costs. As \nthe urban poor often live on a city\u2019s fringe where land or housing is cheaper, they are the most \nexposed to high travel costs.  \n \n10.  Affordable and reliable urban transport services are required to allow the urban poor to \naccess economic opportunities. Nonmotorized and public transport tend to be the travel modes \nof the poor; thus, the promotion of such modes over those of private vehicles will ensure that the \nurban poor are able to move around cities and engage in economic activities. \n \n11.  In addition, the poor are more exposed to the transport sector\u2019s negative externalities, \nmost notably accidents and pollution, and suffer the most from inefficient urban transport. Many \nactivities of the poor are undertaken on the streets where pollution levels are higher and \npedestrians are in danger of road accidents. An integrated approach to SUT must have the \nbenefits of environmentally sustainable and inclusive economic growth, as well as mitigate the \nsector\u2019s negative externalities, in order to aid the poor. \n \n12.  The challenge for Asian cities is to deliver a linked urban transport system, which will (i) \nincrease investment in the existing mode share (public transport, nonmotorized transport, and \npedestrian facilities, which account for around 70% of trips in most Asian cities); and (ii) arrest \nthe rush toward private motorized transport. In addition, there should be zero implementation \nlags in adopting technical standards and specifications for vehicles and fuels.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The PPTA\u2019s impact will be to decrease the rate of GHG emissions from DMCs\u2019 transport \nsector. The outcome of the PPTA will provide demonstration cases of energy efficient urban \n ", "  3\ntransport solutions that will lead to significant GHG emission reductions. Assistance will focus \non transport programs and projects that ensure inclusive, energy-efficient, and clean energy \ntransport systems, supported by ADB pipeline investments in sustainable transport in targeted \nDMCs. The PPTA will enable ADB to engage in policy dialogue with DMCs to develop SUT \npolicies, addressing the negative externalities of climate change, fuel security, social costs of \nhealth and accidents, and accessibility for all. The PPTA will also serve as ADB\u2019s focal point in \ndeveloping ADB\u2019s leading role among multilateral development banks for climate change in the \ntransport sector. The PPTA will aim to assess relevant approaches, such as a sectoral clean \ndevelopment mechanism for transport, for any post-2012 climate regime and thus achieve the \nintended impact of the PPTA. \n \n14.  Further,  the  PPTA  will  aim  to  provide  for  the  increased  demand  for  urban  travel. \nTransport analysis and policy solutions will be developed in selected cities to address energy \nuse and to decrease the sector\u2019s climate change contributions through clean, low-carbon urban \ntransport infrastructure and services. Inclusive urban transport systems will be prioritized to \nensure pro-poor accessibility by focusing on modes predominately used by the urban poor, \nincluding nonmotorized and public transport. Replicable pilot interventions will be developed to \nensure that future ADB urban transport sector interventions are inclusive and environmentally \nsustainable. \n \n15.  The PPTA will identify policy and projects in three selected DMCs cities; working closely \nwith regional departments to demonstrate improved urban transport investments and services.  \nSuch work will be based on the findings of earlier STI technical assistance projects and promote \npersonal mobility, pedestrian facilities, public transport improvements, equitable allocation of \nroad space, integrated land use and transport facilities and restraints to private vehicle use. \nWork will be closely coordinated with other ADB initiatives under Strategy 2020 (footnote 6) and \nenhance ADB\u2019s work in the urban sector. As such, close ties will be developed between this \nPPTA and the Cities Development Initiative for Asia.8  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n16.  To achieve the outcome of ADB\u2019s STI and to align ADB\u2019s transport sector with the \ndelivery of clean and energy efficient transport infrastructure and services, a commitment and \nprioritization of SUT pipeline projects will be developed. The PPTA will provide demonstrational \nbest practices in the selected cities. The lessons learned from the PPTA will be scaled up and \nscaled out to other cities across the region. A staff member within each relevant regional \ndepartment will be designated as advocate for clean and energy efficient transport and SUT \ninterventions.  \n \n17.  To ensure a focus on the GHG emission reductions is achievable and to gain a full \nunderstanding of the transport sector contribution to climate change, the work will establish a \nbaseline and future projections of transport GHG emissions in the selected cities. The work will \nprovide a methodology and monitoring mechanism that will enable DMCs to monitor sector \nGHG emissions and to provide supporting documentation of policies or projects developed to \nmitigate such emissions. The mechanism will be implemented in selected DMCs as part of this \nPPTA to test its performance. A review of ADB projects will be undertaken to assess the climate \n                                                 \n8 A joint initiative of ADB, the governments of Germany and Sweden and was established at a conference held at \nADB in February 2007. It is funded under ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance for Managing the Cities in Asia.  Manila \n(TA 6293-REG). \n \n ", "4     \nchange  impacts  of  interventions,  thus  enabling  a  clearer  understanding  of  the  sector\u2019s \nemissions and ADB\u2019s role in mitigating these in future interventions. The PPTA will provide \ninformation to the parties at the Conference of Parties and other relevant meetings to ensure \nthat pertinent information is available that highlights the sector\u2019s GHG contributions and that \nthey are accounted for in post-2012 agreements. \n \n18.  The cities selected for the PPTA are based on previous STI work and in consultation \nwith the regional departments. Each of the selected cities show a high propensity to address \nSUT challenges in a comprehensive way that will reduce energy use, improve energy efficiency \nand  reduced  GHG  emissions.  The  proposed  cities,  Harbin,  PRC;  Kathmandu,  NEP;  and \nVientiane, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic provide a selection of city types and geographical \ndistribution. A policy agreement between these cities and ADB will be pursued and will be \nsigned  prior  to  allocation  of  PPTA  funds.  Policy  dialogues  with  the  selected  cities  will  be \nundertaken to determine the challenges and priorities, and from these, pilot SUT projects will be \ndeveloped at a prefeasibility stage for inclusion in future country partnership strategies.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n19.  The total cost of the PPTA is estimated at $2,800,000. It will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Climate Change Fund. DMCs have been informed that approval of the PPTA does \nnot commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. The cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  ADB  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  PPTA.  The  Regional  and  Sustainable \nDevelopment Department (RSDD) will oversee the overall administration of PPTA activities. All \nactivities related to city policy development and identification of pipeline projects for possible \nADB financing will be undertaken in coordination with the regional departments. For example, \nthe regional departments and RSDD will collaborate in drawing up a work plan for selected \nDMC cities and estimating the resources and consulting services needed to undertake the \nplanned activities. The regional departments will then oversee the consultants\u2019 performance and \ntechnical  outputs.  RSDD  will  play  a  supportive  administrative  and  technical  role,  including \nadministering the contracts of the consultants and compiling the outputs of the various contracts \ninto a cohesive set of policies, action plans, and project preparations. The Transport Community \nof Practice will play an active role in moving the STI agenda forward. Project development \nactivities funded by this PPTA will only begin in a particular DMC after ADB has received written \nconfirmation from the DMC government that it has no objection to its inclusion in the PPTA.  \n \n21.  The PPTA will begin in February 2009 and conclude in December 2010 (23 months). It \nwill  require  an  estimated  57  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  and  94  \nperson-months of national consulting services. The engagement of consultants will be phased \naccording to the sequence of activities. The international consultants will be expected to spend \nmost of their time in the field. The detailed terms of reference will be drafted in consultation with \nthe regional departments for each work component. Most international consultants are expected \nto  be  recruited  as  individuals  because  of  the  need  to  source  specialized,  country-specific \nexpertise.  Individual  consultants  will  be  engaged  through  either  time-based  or  lump-sum \ncontracts. If a firm must be recruited for complex jobs involving multiple types of expertise, the \nfirms will be recruited using the quality- and  cost-based selection, quality-based selection, \nconsultants\u2019 qualifications selection, or single-source selection methods, depending on the value \nof the contract and the complexity of the assignment. Also, firms will submit either full or biodata \n ", "  5\ntechnical proposals, and be awarded either time-based or lump-sum contracts. The recruitment \nof  consultants  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The outline terms of reference are in \nAppendix  3.  Disbursements  under  the  PPTA  will  be  done  in  accordance  with  the  ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (January 2008, as amended from time to time), \nand all procurement of goods and other services under the PPTA will be done in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Upon completion of \nthe PPTA, all equipment procured by the consultants under the PPTA will be turned over or \ndisposed of in accordance with ADB\u2019s Project Administration Instructions.9  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n \n22.  The President recommends that the Board approve the provision of technical assistance \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $2,800,000 on a grant basis for preparing the Implementation of \nAsian City Transport\u2013Promoting Sustainable Urban Transport in Asia Project.   \n \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2009.
