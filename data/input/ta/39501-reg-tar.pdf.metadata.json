The policy paper on the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) Use of Consultants1 and the \nrevised ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants2 support and strengthen ADB\u2019s ongoing \ncommitment to promote the use of developing member country (DMC) national consultants. In \nthe past, this support has included (i) in-country \"developing domestic consultants\" (DDC) \nseminars focused on raising awareness of and providing advice on how to win ADB business, \nand (ii) in some countries, strategic studies of the consulting industry.3 This regional technical \nassistance (RETA)4 supports improving and expanding DDC seminars (now called \"developing \nnational consultants\" [DNC] seminars) in selected DMCs over a 2-year period (late 2006 to \n2008), including the creation of web-based training materials to reach national consultants who \ndo not physically attend the seminars. \n  \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  ADB's demand for national consulting services has grown dramatically over the past 10 \nyears. According to an analysis of ADB technical assistance (TA) projects, on average, national \nconsultants, in DMCs accounted for 40% of consultant person-months in 2005, up from 30% in \n1995. An analysis of 65 randomly selected ADB loan projects from 2000 to 2005 indicated that \non average 1,000 national consulting months were required per project. This growth has been \nfuelled by a couple of factors, including the improved quality of national consultants in some \ncountries, and by the perception that national consulting inputs are less expensive and often \nmore sustainable than international consultants. Demand for national consultants has also been \nstimulated by DMC governments\u2019 requirements to reorganize, downsize and outsource more \nDMC government activities to consultants. However, within the Asia\u2013Pacific region, there are \nsignificant disparities in the ability of countries to meet the growing demand for international-\nquality national consulting services. \n \n3.  National  consulting  industries  in  Asia  are  at  various  stages  of  growth.  Developed \neconomies,  including  Japan,  Republic  of  Korea,  Malaysia,  and  Singapore,  have  mature \nconsulting industries and export their services to other countries in the region and beyond. Of \nthe middle-income countries, India has a developed national industry and likewise exports \nservices  within  the  region;  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  has  strong  capabilities  in  the \nengineering sector, is rapidly building consulting capacity in the \u201csofter\u201d sectors, and has been \nexporting services under its own bilateral aid program. DMCs with stronger English language \ncapabilities, such as Bangladesh, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka, possess growing \nnational industries and have had some success in exporting consulting services within the \nregion. Other countries are lagging for various reasons, including the absence of a regulated \nbusiness environment, lack of awareness of the benefits of consulting, a weak consulting skills \nbase, and the absence of strong associations to represent and promote the national consulting \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006.

Manila    \n3  ADB has been supporting the development of the national consulting industry in the People's Republic of China \nthrough ADB.1995. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Study on the Local Consulting \nIndustry. Manila (TA 2273-PRC); and ADB.1999. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the \nRegulatory Framework for the Engagement of Consultants. Manila (TA 3138-PRC). Currently, ADB is implementing \nADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to People\u2019s Republic of China for the Formulation of the Regulation for Selection \nand Engagement for Government-Financed Projects. Manila (TA 4486-PRC). ADB will be supporting Technical \nAssistance to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for Strengthening Domestic Consulting Services (Project Number \n39048-PAK) (scheduled third quarter 2006). \n4  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 7 August 2006 \n ", "2   \nindustry. These deficiencies can result in serious imbalances between the demand for and the \nsupply  of  quality  national  consultants\u2014both  firms  and  individuals.  Such  imbalances  create \nincentives to broaden the capacity of the national consulting industry throughout the region. \n \n4.  The DDC seminars have resulted in tangible gains to the national consulting industries of \nmany DMCs. In general, the DMCs and the sponsors of these seminars\u2014usually consulting \nassociations\u2014have been enthusiastic about the seminars. However, the content and delivery \napproaches of these seminars were insufficiently tailored to individual DMCs. The seminars \nfeatured  a  standardized  agenda  that  focused  primarily  on  ADB\u2019s  recruitment  policies  and \nprocedures for selection and engagement of consultants. Selection of participants was often \nlimited to members of the sponsoring association. Government officers were rarely invited, and \nparticipation by consulting entities other than consulting firms and individual consultants\u2014\nincluding nongovernment organizations (NGOs) or universities\u2014was limited. As a result, the \nseminars failed to take advantage of the opportunity to increase demand for consultants by \ndemonstrating the benefits of consulting to the public and private sectors. The seminars also \nfailed to stimulate the supply side by creating awareness of the business and employment \nopportunities that a robust consulting industry can offer. \n \n5.  The  planning,  scheduling,  content,  and  delivery  approaches  of  the  2006\u20132008 \nseminars\u2014renamed  DNC  seminars\u2014will  be  restructured  to  reflect  the  above  issues  and \nshortcomings through: \n \n(i)  preparing a suite of training modules,5 including new options for (a) enhancing a \nnational consulting industry, (b) the consulting firm\u2019s business development cycle, \nand (c) fraud and corruption in the recruitment process; \n(ii)  prioritizing the scheduling of the seminars through closer consultation with ADB \nregional departments and resident missions, and taking into account specific \nrequests from DMCs and country strategy programs; \n(iii)  tailoring, in consultation with the sponsor, the seminar modules to meet the \nunique requirements of each DMC (Appendix 2); \n(iv)  encouraging  the  seminar  sponsors  to  broaden  participation  by  inviting  key \nindustry players including (a) government officials who are involved in regulatory \nand procurement reform; (b) representatives from (other) consulting associations; \n(c) consulting firms; (d) individual consultants; and (e) other entities, including \nNGOs, research institutes, and universities; \n(v)  enhancing  approaches  to  seminar  delivery  through  the  incorporation  of \ninteractive exercises, case studies, and  greater use of laptops; and \n(vi)  designing  and  disseminating  an  interactive  digital  versatile  disc  (DVD)  for \nelectronic outreach of the DNC seminars. \n  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The design and monitoring framework is included as Appendix 1. The impact of the TA \nwill be the establishment of international-standard consulting industries in DMCs. The outcome \nwill be strengthened DMC consulting industries, evidenced by (i) increased number of national \nfirms and individuals registering, submitting expressions of interest in, and winning ADB TA and \n                                                 \n5  ADB\u2019s Central Operations Services Office (COSO) is currently reviewing the content, modularization, and delivery \nof its outreach seminars, including seminars on country project implementation and administration, business \nopportunities, use of consultants, results-focused project performance management systems, and developing \nnational consultants. ", "  3\nloan consulting assignments; (ii) increased use of national consultants in DMC government-\nfinanced projects, (iii) a broader range of service providers in the DMCs; and (iv) an increased \nnumber of national consultants winning regional assignments. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n7.  ADB\u2019s Central Operations Services Office (COSO) has outlined a framework for baseline \nrating and monitoring emergence of DMCs' consulting industries (Appendix 2). These range \nfrom  \u201cundeveloped\u201d  (characterized  by  an  unregulated  procurement  environment,  few \nindependent consulting firms, narrow demand, and a limited supply base) to \u201cmature\u201d (with a \nbroad  range  of  service  providers,  regulated  procurement  environments,  public  and  private \nsectors actively using consultants, and services exported regionally and globally). COSO will \nuse this framework to tailor the content of the DNC seminars and relay focused advice to DMCs \nbased on the status of their national consulting industries. By way of example, a DNC seminar \nin a country with an \u201cundeveloped\u201d national consulting industry might include a special module \non how to write curriculums vitae, in contrast to a seminar in a country with a \u201cdeveloped\u201d \nindustry, which might include a module on diagnostic analysis of the national consulting industry. \n \n8.  Planning and scheduling of DNC seminars for a given year will commence in September \nof the preceding year, and will be prioritized through (i) consultation with regional departments \nand resident missions in relation to current, anticipated, potential TA and loan portfolios; and \n(ii) direct requests from DMCs. Sponsors will be identified, and based on the industry status and \nthe specific demands of the sponsor, the seminars will deliver modules that reflect the needs of \nthe DMC's consulting industry. COSO will encourage the sponsor to advertise the seminar \nlocally as well as on the ADB website at least 2 months in advance, and select a broad range of \nparticipant representatives of the consulting industry, including government staff responsible for \nprocurement,  and  service  providers  including  firms,  individuals,  NGOs,  universities,  and \nresearch institutes.  \n \n9.  The draft DNC seminar schedule for a given year should be in place by December of the \npreceding year. Each seminar will last 2 days; under the RETA, up to 20 seminars will be \nconducted.  To ensure that TA resources are used efficiently, in some cases a single regional \nseminar will be held to address the requirements of two or three DMCs. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n10  The cost of the RETA is estimated at $400,000. The detailed cost estimates are shown \nin Appendix 3. The RETA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n11  The TA will be implemented over a 2-year period from late 2006 to December 2008. \nADB will be the Executing Agency and COSO will implement the RETA. The resource persons \nfor the seminars will be COSO staff with strong knowledge of DMC consulting industries and \nADB\u2019s policies and procedures on the use of consultants. All goods financed out of the RETA \nwill be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s procurement guidelines. \n \n12.  Most events will be sponsored by national DMC consulting associations working in \nconsultation with the government. The sponsor will be responsible for in-country organization, \nincluding advertisement, arranging and covering the cost of the venue, audiovisual equipment, \nproviding secretarial assistance, making logistical arrangements, food and snacks during the \n ", "4   \nworkshop,  and  issuing  invitations  to  interested  participants.  The  sponsor  may  charge \nparticipants a nominal fee to cover costs; the participants will be responsible for their own travel \nand accommodation costs; an exception to this might apply to regional seminars. \n \n13.  The seminars will be conducted in English; however, interpreters will be used when \nnecessary.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n14.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis for \nDeveloping National Consultants in Developing Member Countries, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n ", "                      Appendix 1  5\n                         \n           \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions and \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  Risks \nMechanisms \nImpact      Assumptions \nDMCs  with  international- (cid:131)  Structured industry with active  (cid:131)  Government  (cid:131) National consulting \nstandard  consulting  consulting association(s) and  statistics  industry is \nindustries  broad range of internationally  (cid:131)  National  independently regulated \ncompetitive suppliers  procurement law  (cid:131) Government continues \n(cid:131)  Procurement policies and  (cid:131)  ADB annual  to support the industry \nprocedures meeting  review of national  (cid:131) Promotion and \ninternational standards  consulting  implementation of  \n(cid:131)  Increased use of consultants  industries   ethical consulting \nby private sector in the DMCs  (cid:131)  Annual ADB  (cid:131) Vibrant DMC private \n(cid:131)  Increased number of  consultant  sector prepared to pay \nconsultants participating in  statistics  for national consulting \ninternational business    services \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \nDMC consulting industries  (cid:131)  From late 2006 to 2008, 30%  (cid:131)  Annual ADB  (cid:131)  DMC governments \nstrengthened  increase in the number of  statistics  promote national \n  national firms and individuals    consulting  \nwinning ADB TA and loan    (cid:131)  Market demand \nconsulting assignments    (cid:131)  Transparent \n(cid:131)  From late 2006 to 2008, 15%  (cid:131)  As above  government policies \nincrease in the number of    and procedures \nnational consultants winning    applied for \nregional assignments    government-financed \n(cid:131)  From late 2006 to 2008, 20%  (cid:131)  ADB  projects \nincrease in the number of  DACON/DICON  (cid:131)  ADB procurement \nother consulting entities, e.g.,  registrations  policies and \nDMC NGOs, universities, and    procedures applied for \nresearch institutes registering    ADB TA and loan \nwith ADB    project recruitment \n(cid:131)  From late 2006 to 2008, 20%  (cid:131)  DMC government  (cid:131)  Procurement law \nincrease in the number DMC  statistics   \nconsulting firms and   \nindividuals engaged on \ngovernment-financed projects \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
