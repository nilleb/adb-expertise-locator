An initial environmental examination was \nundertaken in 2005 and the summary initial environmental examination \nwas uploaded to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) website. \n   \nProject Description  The  Project  approved  in  2005  is  a  government  priority.  It  aims  to \nrehabilitate  the  road  from  Dushanbe  to  the  border  with  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic\u2014part  of  the  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation \n(CAREC) Transport Corridors 3 and 5. The supplementary grant will \nreinforce the Project\u2019s development impact, outcome, and outputs. It \nwill  complete  the  entire  Dushanbe\u2013Kyrgyz  border  road  (project \ncorridor). \n \nThe supplementary grant outputs are (i) the rehabilitated road section \nfrom Obigarm to Nurobod (km 95\u2013km 140), (ii) the repaired emergency \nbypass road at km 110\u2013km 112, (iii) the improved central section from \nNurobod to Nimich (km 140\u2013km 217), and (iv) the upgraded border \nsection at Karamik. The new financing will improve 127 kilometers (km) \nof the project corridor and 7 km of the bypass road. \n   \nRationale  The project corridor is a flagship road in Tajikistan and is part of the \nCAREC Transport Corridors 3 and 5 under the CAREC Transport and \nTrade Facilitation Strategy\u2014connecting Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, the \nKyrgyz Republic, the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), Tajikistan, and \nUzbekistan.  Because  of  its  poor  condition,  the  corridor  obstructs \nregional  trade  and  domestic  commercial  activities.  The rehabilitated \nproject corridor will spur regional connectivity, trade, and jobs. Directly, \nit will reduce travel time and transport costs, and improve road safety. It \nwill offer higher prices for agricultural products and lower prices for \nimports. Improved access will encourage commercial activities among \nrural communities and the country's capital, Dushanbe, elevating the \nwelfare of communities, businesses, and people. It will support public \nservice delivery along the corridor, and thereby assist the poor, women, \nand children.  \n \n   \n ", "ii \n  Supplementary finance is prompted by traffic and trade increases, and \nnot by technical and maintenance flaws. Traffic and trade growth have \nsurpassed  forecasts,  and  the  excess  traffic  has  led  to  premature \ndeterioration of the project corridor. The Project was under-designed to \nmeet current traffic needs and future demands\u2014the cost of success \nwas  underestimated.  Left  as  it  is,  the  road  quality  will  continue  to \ndeteriorate. Ultimately, this will result in higher investment costs.  \n \n  Supplementary finance is opportune to (i) close technical and financial \ngaps resulting from the excess deterioration, (ii) reflect cost effective \ndesign  and  best  practice  solution  by  updating  the  outdated  project \nassumptions, (iii) extend the economic life of the project corridor, and \n(iv) augment  the  Project\u2019s  development  impacts.  The  Project,  with \nadditional activities, remains timely and feasible.  \n   \nImpact and Outcome  Supplementary finance complements the Project's impact of restoring \nan integrated and efficient regional road transport and trade link. Its \noutcome is improved access to markets and social services.  \n   \nInvestment Plan  The incremental cost is estimated at $25 million, including taxes and \nduties, as well as physical and price contingencies. \n   \nFinancing Plan  Revised Financing Plan \n($ million) \nAmounts \nBase  New \nTotal \nSource  Project  Financing \nAsian Development Bank  30.0  20.0  50.0   \nGovernment  9.5  5.0  14.5   \nTotal  39.5  25.0  64.5   \n \nADB  will  extend  a  supplementary  grant  of  $20  million  from  ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources.

This will match the scope to \nBeneficiaries  existing  and  projected  traffic  volumes,  and  safeguard  the  project \nbenefits. Additional works will generate 300 semi-skilled and unskilled \njobs during implementation.  \n   \nRisks and  The revised economic internal rate of return is 25%, up from the original \nAssumptions  15%, so the supplementary grant guarantees project viability. Although \nthere are fewer project risks, insufficient maintenance after completion, \ninadequate contractor performance (quality of works, and budget and \ntime consciousness), and weak safeguards management remain key \nconcerns.  \n \nThese will be counteracted by (i) monitoring maintenance of the project \ncorridor after completion\u2014often the cause of project failure; and (ii) \noverseeing contractor and consultant performance regularly. ADB will \nexamine disbursement targets against physical progress, and begin \nevaluating  results  early  during  implementation.

THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nsupplementary  grant  to  the  Republic  of  Tajikistan  for  the  Dushanbe\u2013Kyrgyz  Border  Road \nRehabilitation Project (Phase II).1  \n \nII.  EXISTING PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n2.  The Dushanbe\u2013Kyrgyz border road (the corridor) is an integral part of the regional road \nnetwork  in  Central  Asia\u2014connecting  Afghanistan,  Kazakhstan,  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. This corridor connects with \nPakistan\u2019s ocean ports to the south, and the Russian Federation to the north. Landlocked and \nmountainous, the corridor offers access to regional markets and economic opportunities. The \n2007 Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Transport and Trade Facilitation \nStrategy2 recognized the corridor\u2019s importance, and classified it as Transport Corridors 3 and 5. \nIts implementation action plan prioritized the corridor. Despite its significance, Tajikistan is \nfiscally constrained from improving the corridor and suffers losing key road infrastructure from \nlack of maintenance and funds. Consequently, the poor condition of the corridor undermines \nTajikistan\u2019s potential for regional trade and growth.  \n \n3.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been the lead multilateral financial institution \nsupporting road infrastructure in Tajikistan. ADB\u2019s phased financial assistance for the corridor \nused the Asian Development Fund (ADF) annual allocation for Tajikistan. Three projects were \nprepared: (i) the Dushanbe\u2013Kyrgyz Border Road Rehabilitation Project, Phase I (Phase 1);3 \n(ii) the Dushanbe\u2013Kyrgyz Border Road Rehabilitation Project, Phase II (the original Project); \nand (iii) the CAREC Regional Road Corridor Improvement Project (Phase 3).4 These projects \ncover 350 kilometers (km) of the corridor and 137 km of rural roads. Phase 1 was completed in \n2008 and the other two are still active. They lead to better use of Tajikistan's strategic location \nand road networks for regional trade, and reap direct benefits (reduced transport and time costs) \nfrom  improved  connectivity.  They  also  help  reform  institutions,  secure  road  maintenance \nbudgets, and develop capacity for optimal road operations.  \n \n4.  The Dushanbe\u2013Kyrgyz Border Road Rehabilitation Project, Phase II (the original Project \nand the project road) is the only substantial link between Rasht Valley in Tajikistan and the \ncapital, Dushanbe. Heavy fighting in the Rasht Valley during the 1992\u20131997 civil conflict caused \na poverty incidence higher than the national average. The project area produced agricultural \nproducts for sale to the former Soviet Union but sales declined substantially after independence. \nThis was partly because of the project road\u2019s poor condition, as it obstructed regional trade and \ndomestic commercial activities. Improved access from the original Project offers higher prices \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005.

Direct beneficiaries are passenger \nand freight transport users, vehicle owners, and workers. Indirect welfare benefits accrue to \ncommunities, businesses, the poor, women, children, and the whole economy. \n \nB.  Scope \n5.  The original Project includes (i) improving the two-lane central section (km 140\u2013km 217), \n(ii) mitigating  the  landslide  risk  at  the  Tajik\u2013Kyrgyz  border  crossing  (km  337\u2013km  349), \n(iii) repairing  rural  roads  (60  km),  (iv)  procuring  road  maintenance  and  vehicle  weighing \nequipment,  (v) strengthening  the  accounting  department  in  the  Ministry  of  Transport  and \nCommunications (MOTC), and (vi) developing an HIV/AIDS awareness program. \n \nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n6.  The total cost of the original Project was estimated at $39.5 million, including taxes and \nduties, physical and price contingencies, and interest and other charges (Table 1). \n \nTable 1: Original Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem  Amount \nA.

Implementation Status \n8.  To date, contract awards have amounted to $27.7 million (89% of total loan amount) and \ndisbursements $12.1 million (43% of total contract awards). Only the works on the central \nsection of the project road are behind schedule. \n \n9.  Road Improvement. Civil works are divided into three sections:  \n \n(i)  Central section. The contract of $24.6 million was awarded on 17 January 2007 \nand  about  40%  of  civil  works  were  completed  by  May  2009.  Contractor \nmobilization was slow, but has since accelerated. \n \n(ii)  Border section. The contract of $1.17 million was awarded on 4 August 2008 \nand about 70% of civil works were completed by May 2009. Landslide mitigation \nworks are expected to be completed on time. \n \n(iii)  Rural roads. Implementation is on schedule. Two contracts totaling $0.69 million \nwere awarded on 16 April 2008 and about 60% of the total has been disbursed.  \n \n10.  Road  Network  Sustainability.  MOTC,  the  Executing  Agency  (EA),  requested  to \npostpone procuring road maintenance and vehicle weighing equipment until most of the project \nworks were completed. Procurement is expected to be completed by November 2009. \n \n11.  Consulting Services. These include (i) construction supervision, (ii) institutional support \nto MOTC\u2019s Accounting Department, (iii) project auditing, and (iv) HIV/AIDS awareness. All \nconsulting services outputs are expected to be delivered on time. \n \n12.  Implementation. Civil works of the central section have lagged behind schedule, mainly \nbecause  of  poor  work  planning  by  the  contractor  and  inadequate  supervision  from  the \nconsultants. In addition, the project implementation unit (PIU) under MOTC has (i) a heavy \nworkload with several simultaneous projects; (ii) difficulties retaining competent staff because of \nlow government wages, despite demanding workload and responsibility; and (iii) weak contract \nadministration  for  large  projects.  Lastly,  weak  implementation  of  ADB\u2019s  social  and \nenvironmental  safeguards  policies  remains  a  concern.  Complaints  were  received  while \nimplementing the land acquisition and resettlement plan. Due diligence works in November \n2008  and  March  2009  concluded  that  no  irregularity  occurred  in  compensating  affected \npersons.5 The complaints were mostly from (i) miscommunication between the PIU and affected \npersons, (ii) misunderstanding of ADB's safeguard policies and the original Project, and (iii) \nmissing information and data. Deficient implementation of the environmental management plan \n(EMP) was caused by the PIU\u2019s lack of environmental expertise and consultants inadequate \nsupervision of contractors. \n \nIII.  SUPPLEMENTARY GRANT \n \nA.  Proposed Changes and Rationale \n13.  The supplementary grant will expand the original project scope as follows:  \n \n                                                 \n5 Finnroad.  2009.  Land  Acquisition  and  Resettlement  Complaint  Due  Diligence  Report.              \nhttp://www.adb.org/Documents/Produced-Under-Loans/38236/38236-TAJ-DPL.pdf \n ", "4 \n(i)  Ancillary works. These entail scaled up works beyond the original Project. The \n77 km central section (km 140\u2013km 217) and the 9 km6 border section at Karamik \n(km 337\u2013km 346) will be upgraded. \n \n(a) Central section. Three major additional activities are (i) pavement upgrading \nof the km 140\u2013km 150 section; (ii) additional earthworks on the km 177\u2013\nkm 180 section; and (iii) additional quantities to cover widened technical gaps \nof the initial designs for pavement, drainage, structural, and road safety on \nvarious project road sections. Excess traffic growth has triggered premature \ndeterioration and consequent additional quantities and pavement upgrade. \n \n(b) Border section. The ancillary works involve upgrading the pavement design. \nThis  section  is  a  geologically  hazardous  landslide  area,  and  the  original \nProject  covered  landslide  mitigation  works.  Intensified  cross-border  and \ntransit traffic now calls for improved surface treatment.  \n \n(ii)  New road sections. These are the 41 km7 from Obigarm to Nurobad (km 95\u2013\nkm 140) and the 7 km emergency bypass road (km 110\u2013km 112). These sections \nwere not included in the original project scope, but they were part of the earlier \nPhase 1. ADB\u2019s social and environmental safeguards requirements were fully \nmet under Phase 1. \n \n(a) Km  95\u2013km  140  section.  Works  required  are  upgrading  of  pavement, \ndrainage,  and  road  safety.  A  potential  hydropower  development  project \nlimited the Phase 1 work scope (minor repair) for the section, which assumed \ncompletion  of  the  hydropower  plant  by  2010.  This  is  now  less  relevant \n(para.14), while the current traffic volume demands pavement upgrading. If \nnot, this section will continue to be a missing link along the corridor.        \n \n(b) Emergency  bypass  road.  These  works  are  improvement  of  drainage, \nearthworks, and road safety. The km 110\u2013km 112 section of the project road \nis  highly  prone  to  rock  fall  and  landslide.  The  bypass  road  warrants \nalternative access for emergencies (major blockages). This road underwent \nminor repairs (pothole patching and cleaning) under Phase 1. However, steep \ngrades and deficient drainage remain major safety concerns.    \n \n14.  Rationale. The original project road sections deteriorated faster than expected because \nof the conservative assumptions and designs, the underestimated costs of success from the \nearlier project (Phase 1), and frequent natural disasters during implementation (Appendix 5).  \nThese  factors  have  resulted  in  widened  technical  gaps  between  the  original  design \nspecifications  and  needed  works.  Most  importantly,  the  impact  of  a  nearby  hydropower \ndevelopment  project  was  removed  from  the  original  project  assumption.  Because  of  its \ninvestment size, resettlement impacts, construction period, and macroeconomic prospects, the \nhydropower project will not materialize in the medium term.8 Therefore, the project road will be \nunaffected. The Government and ADB determined that the initial designs do not meet current \n                                                 \n6  The length of the border section has been revised to 9 km from the original estimate of 12 km. \n7  Of this, 4 km is good condition with asphalt pavement. \n8  The Government confirmed that the hydropower development project will not impact the project corridor in the \nmedium term in a letter dated 21 April 2009. \n ", "  5\nand future traffic requirements and minimum safety standards, and there is sufficient economic \njustification to upgrade the original design.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n15.  The supplementary grant will expand the original Project, reinforcing its initial impact and \noutcome. The original Project contributes to an integrated and efficient regional road transport \nand trade link (impact), and leads to improved access to market and social services (outcome).  \nThe  expanded  Project  reflects  cost  effective  design  and  best  practice  solution  to  bridge \ntechnical gaps and extend the project road\u2019s economic life. A revised design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nC.  Eligibility \n16.  The supplementary grant complies with ADB\u2019s Policy on Supplementary Financing.9 It \nmeets the eligibility criteria of (i) financing a modified scope and activities as part of operation \nrestructuring caused by unanticipated circumstances and needs during implementation, (ii) a \nperforming existing project, and (iii) according high government priority and aligning ADB\u2019s \nstrategies  for  Tajikistan  and  CAREC.  The  expanded  Project  does  not  materially  alter  the \npurpose of the original Project. \n \nD.  Revised Costs \n17.  The new investment will cost $25 million, including taxes and duties, and physical and \nprice contingencies (Table 3). The revised total project cost is $64.5 million. Detailed cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nTable 3: Revised Costs \n($ million) \nBase   Additional \nItem  Costs  Costs  Total \nCivil Works  23.6  16.0  39.6 \nProject Management and Consulting Services  3.0  0.8  3.8 \nTaxes and duties  5.9  4.0  9.9 \nSubtotal  32.5  20.8  53.3 \nContingencies  6.4  4.2  10.6 \nFinancing Charges During Implementation  0.6  0.0  0.6 \nTotal Project Cost  39.5  25.0  64.5 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE.

Remedial Steps \n19.  Satisfactory  implementation  of  the  original  Project  is  crucial  to  the  success  of  the \nadditional works (ancillary works and new road sections under the supplementary grant). The \noriginal project schedules, milestones, and costs will be monitored regularly. The EA will work \nwith contractors, consultants, and ADB on the construction work program, performance, and \noutputs. Contractors and consultants have since stepped up works on the central section. At the \nsame time, ADB will examine disbursement targets against actual physical progress, and begin \nevaluating results early during implementation of the original Project as well as the additional \nworks. Tajikistan Resident Mission and headquarters staff will join to follow up on agreed \nschedules and quality of deliverables, and report to ADB Management.  \n \n20.  Phasing works under three distinct projects (Phase 1, original Project, and Phase 3) \nhave been advantageous\u2014better contract supervision and cost control as well as manageable \nworks\u2014but have duplicated supervision consultants\u2019 inputs in administration works. Multiple \ncontracts implemented simultaneously require more coordination and administrative oversight. \nFor the additional works, four PIU staff will be added to bolster its oversight function (para. 21). \nThe key remedial features are efficient contracting strategies. A contract variation is envisaged \nto be issued to the supervision consultants currently implementing Phase 3 to oversee the \nadditional works to minimize overlapping consultant services. Civil works will use a combination \nof methods: (i) ancillary works (central and border section of the original Project) will use \nexisting contract(s) of the original Project and/or Phase 3, where feasible, to minimize the initial \nconstraints of a slow start-up and delayed contractor mobilization imposed on the original \nProject; and (ii) new road sections will use standard competitive bidding as they entail separate \nworks and do not depend on the ongoing works of the original Project. Advance contracting and \nretroactive financing have been approved to accelerate preparation works.  \n \nG.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n \n21.  MOTC will remain the EA. The PIU under MOTC will remain responsible for day-to-day \nproject management, preparing withdrawal applications and progress reports, and maintaining \nproject  accounts  and  financial  records.  The  PIU  has  four  full-time  staff  (two  engineers, \na procurement  specialist,  and  an  accountant)  working  under  the  original  Project.  Before \nawarding additional civil works contract, four additional staff will be recruited (a road engineer, a \nprocurement specialist, a safeguards specialist, and a translator). This will reduce the current \nheavy workloads and strengthen the oversight function (paras. 12 and 20). \n \n ", "7 \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n22.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  in  30  months.  Civil  works  will  be  completed  by \n31 December 2011. A revised implementation schedule is in Appendix 4. \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n23.  All  procurement  under  the  supplementary  grant  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). The new sections (the km 95\u2013km 140 section \nand emergency bypass road) have separate work scopes and are not affected by the ongoing \nworks of the original Project. The km 95\u2013km 140 section will use international competitive \nbidding (ICB) for civil works contracts above $1 million, and the emergency bypass road section \nwill use national competitive bidding (NCB) for civil works contracts $1 million or less. NCB will \nbe under the Law of the Republic of Tajikistan on Public Procurement of Goods, Works and \nServices (3 March 2006), subject to the clarifications and modifications agreed with ADB and \nindicated in section II of the procurement plan (Appendix 3). The EA will update it, as necessary. \nThe ancillary works are proposed to be incorporated in the existing contracts of the original \nProject and/or Phase 3 (either one or both) since they represent a natural extension of an earlier \nor ongoing job. The contractors from the original Project and Phase 3 have been engaged under \nICB procedures and initially indicated keen interest in the additional works opportunities. This is \nthe most expeditious, economical, and efficient option under the circumstances, and will ensure \ncontinuity of works as well as adherence to existing implementation schedules. Furthermore, \ncontinuation of the civil works engagement will ensure a compatible quality of works, and timely \nand seamless work coordination. The procurement plans of the respective projects will be \nupdated to reflect contract variation(s) of the original Project and/or Phase 3 contracts upon \napproval of variation(s) by ADB. The decision to which extent the additional works of the \nsupplementary grant will be incorporated into existing contracts under the original Project and/or \nPhase 3 will be based on the contractors\u2019 earlier and/or ongoing performance, workmanship, \nresources, capacity, and interests to take on the additional works. In case of failed contract \nvariation(s) under both projects (the original Project and Phase 3), procurement of the ancillary \nworks may follow competitive bidding procedures. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n \n24.  Consultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Incremental consulting services inputs are \nconstruction supervision and project auditing. Construction supervision consulting services will \nbe carried out over 18 months, requiring 18 person-months of international consultant inputs \nand  126 person-months  of  national  consultant  inputs.  It  is  envisaged  to  issue  a  contract \nvariation to the supervision consultants currently implementing Phase 3 to gradually oversee \nand supervise the additional works to minimize duplication of consultant inputs, and to ensure \nefficiency and timely delivery. The expected additional tasks of the Phase 3 consultant clearly \nrepresent a continuation of previous and ongoing works, and it was engaged under quality and \ncost-based  selection  using  full  technical  proposals  in  2008.  Positive  feedback  has  been \nreceived from Phase 3 supervision consultants taking on additional works. This approach will \n(i) ensure seamless coordination, technical consistency, and oversight continuity; (ii) minimize \noverlapping consulting inputs, costs, and liability risks; (iii) reduce the mobilization period; and \n(iv) simplify and streamline ongoing ADB-financed project supervision for the project corridor. \nThis option will only be used if the Phase 3 supervision consultant has shown solid performance \nthroughout its engagement, and can demonstrate access to sufficient resources and capacity to \nmanage  additional  supervision  works  under  the  original Project;  and  on  the  condition  that \n ", "8 \ncontract negotiations for the additional works are concluded successfully. Other consultant \nselection methods may be used if the Phase 3 supervision consultant does not meet the \nminimum  requirements  and/or  in  case  of  a  failed  contract  variation(s).  The  draft  terms  of \nreference for construction supervision consulting services are in Supplementary Appendix A. \nLeast cost selection will be used for recruiting project auditing services. \n \n5.  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n \n25.  The Government requested advance contracting and retroactive financing, which ADB \napproved on 29 April 2009. Up to 20% of the proceeds of the supplementary grant will be \neligible for retroactive financing for ongoing and awarded contracts under the original Project, \nprovided  that  eligible  expenditures  on  works  and  consulting  services  follow  the  agreed \nprocedures and were incurred before grant effectiveness within 12 months of the grant signing. \nHowever, this approval does not commit ADB to provide the supplementary grant. \n \n6.  Anticorruption Measures \n \n26.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government, MOTC, and the PIU. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the additional \nworks financed by the supplementary grant. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of \nADB's Anticorruption Policy are included in the grant regulations and the bidding documents. In \nparticular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the supplementary grant shall \ninclude provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of \nthe EA, and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to \nthe supplementary grant. \n \n7.  Financial Management \n \n27.  The EA will manage the flow of funds, accounting, reporting, and auditing. The financial \nmanagement assessment of the EA was conducted under the original Project and was found to \nbe acceptable. Its accounting department is being improved under the original Project since \n26 January 2009. Activities include (i) strengthening the accounting and finance functions of the \nHead Office of MOTC; (ii) designing and implementing a manual for monitoring ADB-financed \nprojects in the Finance and Accounting Division of MOTC; (iii) procuring computer and network \nequipment  for  the  automation  of  financial  and  management  reporting  systems  in  MOTC; \n(iv) defining the role, responsibilities, and organization structure of the proposed internal audit \nfunction in MOTC; and (v) designing and delivering training to finance and accounting staff of \nMOTC. The activities are consistent with the recommendation under the Phase 3 financial \nmanagement assessment report.1  \n \n8.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n28.  The  supplementary  grant  will  be  disbursed  following  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook (2007, as amended from time to time). The disbursement arrangements agreed for \nthe original Project will be retained. A separate imprest account will be established promptly \n                                                 \n1  Supplementary Appendix E under ADB. 2007.

The initial advance to the imprest account is not to exceed $500,000. Total advances are \nnot to exceed the estimated ADB share of eligible project expenditures to be financed through \nthe  imprest  account  for  the  next  6  months  or  10%  of  the  supplementary  grant  amount, \nwhichever is lower. The statement of expenditures procedure will be used for liquidation and \nreplenishment  of  the  imprest  account(s)  and  reimbursement  of  eligible  expenditures  not \nexceeding  $50,000  per  individual  payment.  Payments  in  excess  of  the  statement  of \nexpenditures ceiling will be reimbursed, liquidated, or replenished based on full supporting \ndocumentation. For civil works contracts, direct payment procedures will apply.   \n \n9.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n29.  The  EA  will  prepare  and  submit  to  ADB  quarterly  and  annual  progress  reports  on \nimplementation. These reports will indicate progress made and problems encountered during \nthe review periods, steps taken to remedy the problems or proposed countermeasures, the \nproposed activities, and expected progress during the following periods. One project completion \nreport  will  be  required  for  the  original  Project  and  additional  works  financed  by  the \nsupplementary  grant.  Within  3  months  of  physical  completion  of  the  supplementary  grant, \nMOTC will submit to ADB a combined project completion report of the original Project and \nadditional works of the supplementary grant. The submission date and report contents will be \ncoordinated with the original Project for simplification and further consolidation. \n \n30.  The EA will maintain separate accounts for the additional works of the supplementary \ngrant financed by ADB and the Government, and have them audited by an independent auditor \nacceptable to ADB. The audited project accounts and the auditor\u2019s reports\u2014including separate \nopinion on the use of the fund proceeds, grant compliance, imprest account, and the statement \nof expenditure procedures\u2014will be provided to ADB within 6 months after the end of each fiscal \nyear. These need to be submitted together with those of the original Project. The Government \nwas informed of ADB\u2019s policy on submission of audited accounts, which covers failure to submit \naudited accounts and financial statements by due dates. If submission of an audited project \naccounts is  delayed  by  more  than  6  months  (i)  a  no  commitment  letter  will  be  issued, if \napplicable; and (ii) ADB may not approve new contract awards. If the delay is more than \n12 months, fund disbursements may be suspended or the funds may be canceled. \n \n10.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n31.  The EA has a project performance monitoring system for impacts, outcome, outputs, and \nactivities, which has been updated (Appendix 1). The EA and ADB agreed baseline indicators \ncovering the economic, social, environmental, and poverty reduction impact under the original \nProject. These will be updated, monitored, and reported quarterly. \n \n11.  Stakeholder Participation and Consultations \n \n32.  Due  diligence  was  carried  out  during  preparation  and  implementation\u2014covering \ntechnical,  social,  and  safeguards  issues.  Nongovernment  organizations  and  affected  local \ncommunities were engaged during the process. Regular consultations are being carried out at \nthe higher institutional level, including governments and external aid agencies. \n \n ", "10 \n12.  Reviews \n \n33.  ADB  will  combine  review  of  the  original  Project  and  the  additional  works  of  the \nsupplementary grant. To ensure timely and effective implementation, at least three reviews will \nbe undertaken annually. The EA will monitor implementation and inform ADB promptly of major \nproblems that may result in the target schedule not being met. One project completion report will \nbe required after the closing of the supplementary grant (para. 29). ADB will field a combined \nproject completion review mission upon completion of the additional works. \n \nIV.  BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Economic Benefits \n34.  The original project economic analysis remains valid, although adjustments have been \nmade to reflect additional investment costs. These extra costs deliver added benefits and \nsafeguard investments made so far. They correct technical gaps and reinforce the delivery of all \noutputs. Accordingly, the new economic internal rate of return (EIRR) increased to 25%\u2014up \nfrom 15%. The EIRR is highly sensitive to traffic and trade forecasts, and less responsive to \nincreased investment and operating costs (Appendix 5). \n \nB.  Sustainability \n35.  The Government has kept its commitment on its road maintenance budget. The road \nmaintenance budget increased at an average annual growth of 18% from TJS13 million in 2004 \nto TJS31 million in 2009. The actual amount disbursed increased from TJS13 million in 2004 to \nTJS27 million in 2008. A separate maintenance budget will be retained after the supplementary \ngrant approval and $200,000 will be made available annually for the project road. ADB will \ncontinue to engage the Government to increase road maintenance financing to the extent \npossible given its fiscal constraints and the national priority projects. \n \nC.  Environmental Impact \n36.  The additional works of the supplementary grant are classified category C, and the \noriginal Project category B. The additional works are not environmentally sensitive, and will not \nentail  significant  environmental  impacts.  Initial  environmental  examinations  (IEEs)  were \nprepared for Phase 1 (new sections) and the original Project (ancillary works), and uploaded to \nADB\u2019s website. The EMP included in each IEE outlines mitigation measures, monitoring actions, \nand capacity building. The EMP will be part of the contract documents and will be monitored by \nsupervision consultants and the EA. \n \nD.  Social and Poverty Impact \n37.  The project area is primarily agricultural and unemployment is high. The additional works \nwill  generate  employment\u2014300  new  unskilled  and  semi-skilled  jobs  will  be  created,  and \nencourage hiring of poor people from the project area. The original Project directly benefits \nabout 180,000 people in 26 districts and 120,000 poor villagers residing adjacent to the project \nroad. The project road connects Tajikistan to international markets as well as local markets in \nbetween, opening up economic opportunities for communities, businesses, and people. With \nless transport costs and time, a higher value for agricultural products is warranted. Moreover, \nthe  original  Project  is  improving  rural  roads  to  connect  rural  villages  to  the  project  road. \nImproved rural access, through better public service delivery and road safety, benefit vulnerable \n ", "  11\ngroups (the poor, women, and children) and rural communities. Women benefit directly through \nthe  HIV/AIDS  awareness  program  implemented  under  the  original  Project,  targeting  local \ncommunities and high-risk groups. \n \nE.  Social Safeguards \n38.  The  resettlement  impact  is  limited.  The  additional  works  will  take  place  within  the \nexisting right-of-way. They do not entail land acquisition or resettlement. A short resettlement \nplan has been prepared for the original Project. No resettlement impact is envisaged for the new \nsections (para 13 [ii]). \n \nF.  Risks \n39.  The  main  risks  are  (i)  insufficient  maintenance  after  completion;  (ii)  inadequate \ncontractor performance (quality of works, and budget and time consciousness); and (iii) weak \nsafeguards  management.  The  risks  are  manageable.  These  will  be  counteracted  by  (i) \nmonitoring maintenance of the project corridor after completion\u2014often the cause of project \nfailure; and (ii) overseeing contractor and consultant performance regularly. ADB will examine \ndisbursement  targets  against  physical  progress,  and  begin  evaluating  results  early  during \nimplementation. Tajikistan Resident Mission and headquarters staff will join to follow up on \nagreed  schedules  and  quality  of  deliverables,  and  report  to  ADB  Management.  Additional \nsafeguard inputs will help ensure safeguard compliance.  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \n40.  In addition to the specific covenants in the Financing Agreements (Special Operations) \nunder the original Project, the Government has given the following assurances, which are \nincorporated in the legal document. Variations from the original Financing Agreements are listed \nbelow. \n \n41.  Maintenance Financing. The Government will annually allocate additional $200,0002 \n(plus inflation since 2009) for maintenance of new road sections. The Government will ensure \nthat actual annual expenditures for road maintenance (including emergency maintenance, but \nexcluding rehabilitation and construction) for roads under MOTC jurisdiction are increased at the \nsame rate as increases in the overall national budget during 2009\u20132011. \n \n42.  Auditing.  The  Government  will  submit  audited  project  accounts  to  ADB  within \nsix (6) months from the end of the fiscal year during implementation. \n \n43.  Safeguard  Unit.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  permanent  safeguard  unit \ninstitutionalized within the PIU is adequately staffed and equipped to enable it to review, audit, \nand  monitor  safeguard  implementation,  and  that  it  submits  a  monitoring  report  every \nsix (6) months to ADB and to relevant governmental agencies through the EA. \n \n44.  Environment. The Government will cause MOTC to ensure that \n \n(i)  additional works are designed, constructed, implemented, and maintained following \nthe EMP, IEE, and the summary IEE of the original Project, ADB\u2019s Environment \nPolicy (2002), and the Government\u2019s laws and regulations; and \n                                                 \n2 Calculated based on TJS15,000 per km. Average 2008 maintenance cost is TJS1,000 per km. \n ", "12 \n(ii) contractors follow mitigation measures of the agreed EMP, IEE, and SIEE of the \noriginal  Project,  and  report  regularly  on  implementation,  and  in  the  event  of \nunanticipated adverse environmental impacts, such impacts are to be reported to the \nEA and ADB, and remedial actions are consulted with affected persons, the EA, and \nADB. \n \n45.  Resettlement. The Government will cause MOTC to ensure that \n \n(i)  in exceptional or unforeseen situations, e.g., landslide during implementation that \naffect life, residences, and other structures, relocate affected persons immediately \nand inform ADB, and pay any statutory compensation and resettlement assistance \npromptly; and \n \n(ii) in  the  event  of  accidents  or  mishaps  at  the  project  site,  the  party  responsible \ncompensates the affected persons promptly, equitably, and transparently; and the \nEA ensures this is executed appropriately.  \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n46.  I am satisfied that the proposed supplementary grant would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and, acting in the absence of the President, \nunder the provisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the \nBoard approve the supplementary grant not exceeding $20,000,000 to the Republic of Tajikistan \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources for the Dushanbe\u2013Kyrgyz Border Road Rehabilitation \nProject (Phase II), on terms and conditions that are substantially in accordance with those set \nforth in the draft Grant Agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n \nC.

General \n1.  The original Project\u2019s economic analysis was adjusted for additional investment costs to \ndetermine  its  impacts  on  net  economic  benefits.  For  consistency,  the  original  Project\u2019s \nmethodology was used to recalculate an economic internal rate of return (EIRR). The original \nProject\u2019s assumptions were reexamined and updated\u2014gross domestic product (GDP) growth, \nnormal  traffic,  domestic  generated  and  international  generated  traffic,  and  growth  rate  per \nvehicle type. The revised economic analysis covers 23 years (2007\u20132029), based on a 6-year \nimplementation period. All figures were translated into 2009 constant prices. Actual costs to \nMarch  2009  were  incorporated,  and  projected  annual  costs  were  extrapolated  based  on \nestimated  disbursement  profile.  They  were  converted  to economic  costs  using world  price \nnumeraire.  Price  contingencies,  interest  during  construction,  and  taxes  and  duties  were \nexcluded. A standard conversion factor of 0.9 was applied to non-tradables. The assumption on \nthe potential hydropower development project near the project area, which limited the pavement \ndesign on km 95\u2013km 150 (Phase 1 scope, including 10 kilometers of the original Project), was \nremoved.  \n \n2.  The original Project\u2019s economic analysis remains valid. The additional costs deliver \nadded benefits, and safeguard investments made so far. The supplementary grant corrects \ntechnical gaps and reinforces the delivery of all outputs. Accordingly, the new EIRR increased to \n25%\u2014up  from  15%.  The  EIRR  is  highly  sensitive  to  traffic  and  trade  forecasts,  and  less \nresponsive to increased investment and operating costs.  \n \nB.  Revised Assumptions \n3.  The original Project\u2019s assumptions were revisited, and its summary is highlighted in \nTable A5.1. The findings confirm the original Project\u2019s conservative assumptions, resulting in a \nconservative design for the project road. Frequent and severe seismic activities incurred on the \nproject road after the original Project's contract awards worsened premature road deterioration.   \n \nTable A5.1: Assumptions versus Actual Comparison \n  Original Project  Revised \nDomestic Traffic  (2008 estimates)  (2008 actual) \nBase traffic level (vehicle per day)     \n   Central section  716 (580 in 2004)  1,300 \n   Border section  29 (20 in 2004)  150 \n   Rural roads  31 (25 in 2004)  50 \nReal GDP growth (%)  6  7.9 \nBase growth rate for 2004\u20132008a (%)     \n   Cars  6  16 \n   Buses  5  3 \n   Trucks  6.5  0 \nBase growth rate for 2009\u20132029 (%)     \n   Cars  6  10 \n   Buses  5  3 \n   Trucks  6.5  3 \nGrowth on year after Phase 1 completion (%)  10  20 \nGrowth on year after Phase 2 completion (%)  10  20 \n \n ", "22  Appendix 5 \nOriginal Project  Revised \nInternational Traffic  (2008 estimates)  (2008 actual) \nTajikistan\u2013PRC trade market share  1.9% in 2004  20.3% in 2007 \n20% from 2015 \nAfghanistan\u2013PRC trade market share  0.04% in 2004  11% in 2007 \n10% from 2015   \nEquilibrium year  2015  2007 \nEIRR overall (including rural roads)  15.4%  24.9% \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, GDP = gross domestic product, PRC = People's Republic of China. \na\n Based on number of new vehicle registered. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n4.  Actual 2008 traffic volume, real GDP, and trade volume with the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC) exceeded the original Project\u2019s projection for the year. The 2004\u20132008 average \nreal GDP growth in Tajikistan was 8.2% per annum. Traffic volume on the project road reached \nits pre-1990 level (at its peak) in 2008, and the completed Phase 1 significantly contributed to \nthe increase in domestic generated traffic on Phase 2 road sections. The PRC economy also \ngrew remarkably, at an annual growth of over 15% in current prices during the same period \n(2004\u20132008). Trade with the PRC is crucial for Tajikistan economy with imports from the PRC \ndominating Tajikistan market. This is illustrated by a substantial increase of bilateral trade in \nvalue terms,1 at an average growth of 70% per annum. The original Project assumed that the \nPRC\u2019s share of trade with Tajikistan would increase from 2% in 2004 to 20% in 2015. This 20% \nbenchmark market share was outstripped in 2007. The revised assumption includes continuing \nrapid growth for 2007\u20132010, but declining from 65% per year in 2008 to a more modest 20% per \nyear in 2010. A moderate increase in the projected traffic level reflects the slowing domestic \neconomy in 2009\u20132010, although border traffic remains strong (Table A5.2). PRC\u2013Tajik trade \nwill generate traffic of 115 vehicles per day in 2010, growing nearly ten-fold to about 1,080 \nvehicles per day in 2029. \n  \nTable A5.2: Traffic Counts and Projection \n(vehicles per day) \n  Actual    Projected \nRoad section  2007  2008    2009  2010 \nKm 95\u2013140  1,572  1,789  1,874  1,965 \nCentral section (km 140\u2013217)   1,171  1,306  1,437  1,481 \nBorder section (km 337\u2013346)   150  332  473  650 \n km = kilometer.       \n Source: Ministry of Transport and Communications. \n \nC.  Results \n5.  Overall, the Project (the original Project and additional works) remains economically \nviable, despite additional costs. The new EIRR is 24.9%, up from 15.4%. The economic net \npresent value is $56.4 million, up from $9.8 million, using a 12% discount rate (Table A5.3). \nSensitivity analysis (Table A5.4) indicated that the EIRR is highly sensitive to domestic traffic \nincreases, and less responsive to changes in capital and maintenance costs, and international \ngenerated traffic.2 This is consistent with the escalated EIRR from that of the original Project. \n \n                                                 \n1  The total bilateral trade was valued at $324 million in 2006\u2014up 105% on the previous year. \n2  Economic benefits from international generated traffic are shared with Afghanistan, the Kyrgyz Republic, and the \nPRC.  \n ", "Appendix 5  23\nTable A5.3: Revised Economic Internal Rate of Return \n($ million) \n  Capital  Maintenance  Total  Normal Domestic  International Rural  Total  Net \nYear  Costs  Costs  Costs Traffic  Generated Generated  Roads  Benefits Benefits\n2007  4.76    4.76  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  (4.76) \n2008  6.44    6.44  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  (6.44) \n2009  7.85  7.85  3.39  0.00  0.00  0.19  3.58  (4.27) \n2010  15.71  15.71  3.98  0.14  0.19  0.46  4.77  (10.93) \n2011  15.71  0.90  16.61  5.71  0.21  0.43  0.49  6.84  (9.76) \n2012  2.09  1.80  3.89  6.58  0.24  0.66  0.52  8.01  4.11 \n2013  0.00  1.80  1.80  7.63  0.27  0.92  0.56  9.38  7.57 \n2014  0.00  1.80  1.80  8.86  0.31  1.20  0.60  10.97  9.17 \n2015  0.00  1.80  1.80  10.36  0.36  1.52  0.64  12.89  11.08 \n2016  0.00  6.30  6.30  12.00  0.42  1.73  0.69  14.83  8.52 \n2017  0.00  0.90  0.90  13.99  0.49  1.97  0.73  17.17  16.27 \n2018  0.00  1.80  1.80  16.40  0.58  2.25  0.79  20.02  18.21 \n2019  0.00  1.80  1.80  19.35  0.68  2.61  0.84  23.47  21.67 \n2020  0.00  1.80  1.80  23.05  0.81  3.04  0.90  27.80  25.99 \n2021  0.00  1.80  1.80  27.23  0.97  3.50  0.96  32.67  30.86 \n2022  0.00  6.30  6.30  30.72  1.11  3.90  1.03  36.76  30.46 \n2023  0.00  0.90  0.90  34.02  1.23  4.28  1.10  40.64  39.74 \n2024  0.00  1.80  1.80  37.06  1.35  4.62  1.18  44.21  42.40 \n2025  0.00  1.80  1.80  40.06  1.47  4.94  1.26  47.74  45.93 \n2026  0.00  1.80  1.80  42.73  1.58  5.23  1.35  50.89  49.09 \n2027  0.00  1.80  1.80  45.48  1.69  5.53  1.44  54.14  52.34 \n2028  0.00  6.30  6.30  48.24  1.80  5.79  1.54  57.38  51.07 \n2029  0.00  1.80  1.80  51.31  1.92  6.08  1.65  60.97  59.16 \n                   \n                EIRR  24.9%\n                NPV  56.44\n(  ) = negative, EIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nTable A5.4: Sensitivity Analysis \nEIRR   ENPV   Switching Value  \nItem  (%)  ($ million)  (%) \nBase case  24.9  56.4   \n1 year implementation delay  20.4  43.9   \nNormal traffic \u201320%  21.9  40.7  61 \nTotal benefit \u201320%  21.1  36.9  53 \nCapital cost +20%  22.2  50.3  146 \nNormal traffic \u201320%; capital costs  19.2  33.7   \n+20% \nInternational generated traffic \u201320%  24.5  54.9  412 \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, ENPV = economic net present value.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20090702143615+08'00'", "Subject": "Proposed Supplementary Asian Development Fund Grant", "Author": "ACV", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Keywords": "dushanbe-kyrgyz border road rehabilitation, border border road rehabilitation project, tajikistan road rehabilitation projects, dushanbe\u2013kyrgyz border road, adb Asian Development Fund Grant, adf grant 0154, adb project 38236", "Producer": "Acrobat Elements 7.0 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20090730142841+08'00'", "Title": "Dushanbe\u2013Kyrgyz Border Road Rehabilitation Project, Phase II  (Supplementary)"}, "author_page": " \nVice-President  X.
