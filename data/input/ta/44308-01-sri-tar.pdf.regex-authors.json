INTRODUCTION \n1.  With the end in 2009 of the war, which lasted about 3 decades, the Government of \nSri Lanka is focusing on measures for improving economic management, accelerating economic \ngrowth, and rapidly reducing remaining poverty. While medium-term economic prospects are \nencouraging, the uncertain global financial and economic situation has made policy choices \nmore  complex  and  challenging.  Sri  Lanka  needs  to  undertake  policy  reforms,  strengthen \ninstitutions to increase the resilience of the economy, and adapt its economic management and \nplanning  process  to  an  uncertain  external  economic  environment.  Given  the  longstanding \nengagement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) with Sri Lanka, the government approached \nADB for technical assistance (TA) for improving planning and policy formulation. During the \ncountry programming mission in June 2010, ADB discussed the scope and modality of the TA1 \nwith the government. The request has strong justification as the government has displayed its \ncommitment  by  undertaking  macroeconomic  stabilization  measures  under  the  International \nMonetary Fund\u2019s standby arrangement and is now determined to carry the reform process \nfurther  by  strengthening  the  planning  system  and  evaluating  different  policy  options  for \naddressing  constraints  to  overall  economic  efficiency  and  medium-  to  long-term  economic \nprospects. ADB\u2019s Sri Lanka Resident Mission undertook a fact-finding mission in July 2010 and \nan agreement was reached with the government on the scope of the TA, its impact, outcomes, \noutputs, and implementation and financing arrangements (Appendix 1). \n   \nII.  ISSUES   \n2.  Since the end of the war in 2009, the Sri Lankan economy has the potential to grow \nrapidly (at least around 8% per annum) and alleviate poverty, which is currently estimated at \n15%. Economic growth has picked up markedly in 2010 and is projected to be around 7%; \ninflation is projected to be around 6.5%. The government is taking measures to reduce the fiscal \ndeficit to more sustainable levels. Foreign exchange reserves have increased dramatically over \nthe last 2 years, and Sri Lanka is able to raise money in international capital markets on \nconsiderably improved terms. With improved planning and policy reforms, economic growth can \nbe  accelerated.  Conversely,  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction  potential  could  be \ncompromised  by  ineffective  planning  and  lack  of  policy  reforms.  Policy  choices  and  their \nimplementation  have  become  complex  and  challenging  in  an  uncertain  global  economic \nenvironment.  \n \n3.   Sri Lanka needs to reorient its policy framework to suit the requirements of a middle-\nincome country in which the private sector is expected to play an increasingly important role. \nThe government will continue to create an enabling environment for greater participation of the \nprivate sector. As the economy becomes more integrated with the external economy through \nboth trade and capital flows, the following issues will take center stage in policy debates: \nfinancial sector development, management of capital flows, macroeconomic management with a \nrelatively open capital account of the balance of payments, developing appropriate regulatory \nand supervisory systems, and overall flexibilities of policies. Some key policy issues that need to \nbe analyzed and better understood are (i) a policy mix to maintain domestic demand if industrial \ncountries continue to experience sluggish growth in the medium term\u2014a plausible scenario in \nthe current environment; (ii) what needs to be done to divert exports from industrial countries \n(where demand could be sluggish) to emerging market economies; (iii) diversification of the \nexport composition; (iv) monetary and exchange rate policies if interest rates remain low in \nindustrial countries and speculative capital continues to flow to Sri Lanka for short-term capital \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 26 October 2010. \n ", "2   \ngains; (v) sequencing of financial sector liberalization, regulation, and supervision, taking into \naccount the lessons of the global financial crisis; (vi) assessment of systemic risks in the \nfinancial  sector;  (vii)  policies  to  strengthen  fiscal  management  so  that  public  debt  can  be \ncontained at prudent levels; (viii) policies that encourage balanced growth between sectors in \nthe economy, specifically policies to revive the manufacturing sector; (ix) a sound framework for \nencouraging  public\u2013private  partnership,  especially  for  financing  infrastructure  development; \n(x) balanced development of the rural sector, which still provides sustenance to a majority of the \npopulation; (xi) addressing issues related to climate change; and (xii) policies that encourage \ninclusive growth so that benefits of growth are more widely shared.  \n \n4.  Enhancing understanding of these policy issues will require sound analytical work to be \nundertaken, drawing on the experience of other countries, and assessing their effectiveness in \nthe Sri Lankan context. Various options will need to be examined. This will facilitate public \ndebate  on  the  policy  options,  which  will  increase  awareness  and  encourage  stakeholder \nparticipation in policy formulation. This process will help build consensus within Sri Lanka on a \npolicy framework for promoting socially inclusive and sustainable economic growth.  \n \n5.  ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2009\u201320112 focuses on two pillars: (i) strengthening \nthe investment climate, and (ii) achieving socially inclusive development. With the end of the \nwar, these two pillars have become the focus of the government\u2019s policy initiatives. The current \nbusiness  environment  requires  significant  improvement.  Sri  Lanka  is  ranked  105  among \n183 countries  in  ease  of  doing  business,  behind  Pakistan  (ranked  85)  and  the  Maldives \n(ranked 87).3 The government is keen to improve the business climate and increase private \nsector participation in the development process. It is also attempting to foster inclusive growth \nby investing public funds in poorer parts of the country. The challenge is to develop a policy \nframework that attracts private investment in the lagging regions to accelerate the pace of \nbalanced  economic  development.  The  TA  will  assist  the  government  in  this  exercise  by \nproviding resource persons who will examine different policy options; establish policy reform \nmilestones; and encourage public debate on key policy issues through publications, seminars, \nand workshops. \n \n6.  Policy makers face different situations that require periodic changes and calibration of \neconomic policies. They also need to work within the planning framework so that economic \npolicies can be formulated to meet the medium- to long-term goals of the government. Moreover, \npolicy makers require assistance on a large number of issues, so it is difficult to predict the \nultimate scope of TA that aims to strengthen planning and policy formulation. Taking these \nfactors into account, this TA is Phase 1 in the process of providing continuing support to the \ngovernment. Phase 2 of the TA is planned for late 2011. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.   The impact of the TA will be better policy formulation on a range of economic issues \nconfronting  Sri  Lanka,  so  that  medium-term  economic  growth  accelerates  and  poverty  is \nreduced rapidly. The outcome of the TA will be wider discussion and awareness of policy issues \nwithin the country. It will also encourage participation of stakeholders in policy formulation and \nhence facilitate broad support for the policies. The policy makers will be able to examine \n                                                 \n2 ADB. 2008. Country Partnership Strategy: Sri Lanka, 2009\u20132011. Manila. \n3 World Bank. 2010.

The TA will also \nprovide opportunities for Sri Lanka to tap regional and international expertise through resource \npersons  for  seminars  and  discussions,  to  improve  economic  policy  formulation  and \nimplementation in Sri Lanka. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The proposed TA will provide resources for more informed policy making by establishing \na knowledge base through research and analytical studies. It will also facilitate wider discussion \nof policy issues nationally, and provide the government with a forum to elicit views and insights \nof regional and international experts through seminars and workshops. The scope of the TA will \ncover (i) providing assistance for policy research and analysis, data collection, and information \ndissemination; and (ii) creating a forum for policy dialogue and analysis through a partnership \nwith the key stakeholders. The TA will help improve the government\u2019s economic policy reform \nagenda by evaluating policy reforms and providing feedback on implementation, recommending \nnew  ideas  and  policy  options  to  policy  makers,  assisting  policy  makers  in  analyzing  and \nresponding  to  regional  and  global  economic  challenges,  and  fostering  constructive  policy \ndialogue between the government and research institutions within the country and in the region.  \n \n9.  The main output of the TA will be five seminars and conference on policy issues facing \nSri Lanka.  National,  international,  and  regional  resource  persons  will  prepare  background \ndiscussion papers on these issues and provide alternative policy options for discussion at the \nseminars and conferences. Key policy makers, academics, representatives of development \npartners, and other stakeholders will be invited to participate in the seminars and conferences. \nThe other output of the TA will be the publication of a number of books and papers on policy \nissues,  and  documented  proceedings  of  seminars  and  conferences.  To  follow  up  on  the \nseminars and conferences, ADB will hold continuous dialogue with the policy makers and assist \nthem with the sequencing and implementation of policies. ADB will also use the TA to give \nextensive press and media coverage on the major themes discussed in the seminars and \nconferences.  \n  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n10.  The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund \n(TASF-IV).  It  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  $300,000  equivalent  and  the  government  will \ncontribute $53,000 equivalent in administrative support.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n11.  The TA will be jointly administered by the Ministry of Finance and Planning and ADB Sri \nLanka Resident Mission. The National Planning Department of the Ministry of Finance and \nPlanning will be the executing agency.  \n \n12.  A  steering  committee  will  be  formed  to  facilitate  implementation  of  the  TA.  The \ncommittee will be co-chaired by the secretary (or his designated representative) of the Ministry \nof Finance and Planning, and the country director of ADB Sri Lanka Resident Mission. Other \nmembers of the committee will include a representative from the National Planning Department, \na representative from the External Resources Department, the head of research of the Central \nBank of Sri Lanka, the executive director of the Institute for Policy Studies, the head of the \nPresidential  Tax  Commission  and  member  of  the  Advisory  Council  on  Economics  to  the \nPresident  of  Sri  Lanka,  and  two  staff  of  ADB  Sri  Lanka  Resident  Mission.  Government \n ", "4   \ndepartments, most notably the Ministry of Finance and Planning and the Ministry of Economic \nDevelopment,  will  suggest  the  research  topics.  The  steering  committee  will  evaluate  the \nimportance  of  the  proposed  research  project  and  will  determine  the  scope  of  research, \nrequirements of consultant inputs (both domestic and international), and draw up the terms of \nreference for the consultants. The steering committee will review the consultants\u2019 outputs and \nwill determine the most effective method of disseminating the findings of the studies\u2014either \nthrough publications or seminar and/or conference. \n  \n13.  The TA will require the support of both international and national consultants to prepare \npapers on topics identified by the steering committee. The TA envisages the services of five \ninternational and 10 national individual consultants for preparing the research papers. The \ninternational consultants will provide 20 person-months of inputs and the national consultants \nwill provide 40 person-months. In addition, the TA will require the services of 10 international \nand 20 national resource persons who will attend the seminars and conferences and present \npapers on country-specific experiences. The consultants will be recognized experts in their \nfields and the resource persons will be senior policy makers from countries in the region and \nreputed academics. Recruitment of consultants will be in line with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The TA will commence in January 2011 \nand be implemented over 2 years. Disbursement under the TA will be made in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nIV.
