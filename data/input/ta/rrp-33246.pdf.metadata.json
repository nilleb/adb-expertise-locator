To achieve this, an integrated strategy is\nneeded  to  overcome  a  wide  array  of  issues  and  constraints\ncomprising  inadequacies  in  management,  limited  access  to\nfinance  and  modern  technology,  and  impediments  in  the\nregulatory and incentive framework. The distortions and rigidities\nin  the  tax  and  incentive  systems  and  the  complexity  of  the\nregulatory  framework  raise  transactions  costs,  misallocate\nresources, and impede the needed flexibility in decision making if\nSMEs  are  to  become  competitive.  The  absence  of  a  vibrant\nmarket  for  business  services  for  SMEs  constrains  capacity\nbuilding  as  well  as  efforts  to  improve  SMEs  prospects  for\nfinancing by banks. SME access to finance is impeded by the high\ncosts of lending to the sector and by limited capabilities in banks.\nThis  is  reflected  by  limited  use  of  credit  scoring  systems  and\ninformation and communications technology (ICT) that can help\nbanks to better manage their portfolio and reduce the risks of\nlending  to  SMEs.  Access  to  finance  is  further  limited  by\nunnecessary regulatory and legal restrictions to more vigorous\ncompetition in the financial sector, and by limited access of banks\nto  long-term  funding  sources  including  international  capital\nmarkets.  Market  and  institutional  development  to  promote\nappropriate  lending  methods  and  financial  instruments  is  thus\nessential to sustainable financing for SMEs. It is also essential to\nreducing dependence on external support.", "iii\nClassification  Thematic: Economic growth\nGood governance\nObjective\nand Scope The objectives are to create a dynamic SME sector, enhance its\ncapabilities and competitiveness, create jobs and, in doing so,\nreduce poverty. These objectives are to be achieved through an\nintegrated approach that\n(i)  strengthens the enabling business environment for SMEs,\n(ii) catalyzes investment by improving SMEs access to finance\nthrough commercial channels, and\n(iii) enhances  the  capacity  of  the  Sri  Lankan  business\ndevelopment  services  (BDS)  sector  to  efficiently  and\neffectively deliver services to SMEs.\nThe Program comprises (i) a program of policy reforms; (ii) a\nproject to finance a BDS support facility \u2013 the Business Services\nSupport  Facility  (BSSF);  (iii)  a  line  of  credit  each  to  Sampath\nBank, Commercial Bank of Ceylon (CBC), Hatton National Bank\n(HNB), the National Development Bank (NDB), and DFCC Bank\n(DFCC); and (iv) ADB\u2019s partial credit guarantee for commercial\ncofinancing to each of the above banks for onlending directly to\nSMEs.\nThe Sector Development Program will set in place a strategy for\nSME development through the completion of a SME policy white\npaper  by  a  SME  task  force;  establish  a  SME  Policy  Unit  to\naddress  future  SME-related  policy  and  regulatory  issues,  and\nsupport an institutional response\u2014the Deregulation Committee\u2014\nfor identifying and implementing of further policy and institutional\nreforms  needed  to  achieve  competitiveness.  ICT  use  will  be\npromoted as a way to link SMEs with the global economy and\nreduce their costs of accessing information and markets. A BDS\nsupport  facility  will  be  established  to  develop  the  market  for\nconsulting  and  other  services  to  strengthen  capacities  in  both\nSMEs and the banks that may finance them. The facility will be\ncomplemented by measures to promote market and institutional\ndevelopment for SME finance. The market for financing will be\npromoted  by  legal  reform  that  creates  a  level  playing  field,\nallowing  financial  institutions  to  compete  more  efficiently  for\nmarket share. Institutional development is supported through the\nuse  by  banks  of  credit  scoring  and  ICT;  and  by  credit\nenhancements  that  raise  their  profile  in  international  capital\nmarkets. The Program will also initiate the development of an\nagenda  for  legal  reform  leading  to  improvements  in  the  legal\nframework  for  secured  transactions.  This  will  be  important  for\nfacilitating non-bank finance for SMEs.", "iv\nAdjustment Costs  The SMESDP is expected to result in adjustment costs of up to\n$90 million.\nEnvironmental and\nSocial Assessment The environmental category is B. Participating credit institutions\navailing themselves of the lines of credit will be required to ensure\nthat applicable environmental regulations and measures for social\nprotection are enforced in the projects funded. The poverty impact\nassessment indicates positive long-term benefits through growth\nof employment and income.\nThe Sector Development Program\nThe Policy Loan\nLoan Amount\nand Terms A loan of SDR 15,808,000 with the Government as Borrower,\ndrawn  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  with  a  repayment\nperiod  of  24  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  8  years,  and\ncarrying an interest rate of 1.0 percent during the grace period and\n1.5 percent thereafter.\nProgram Period\nand Tranching  The period is from December 2001 to December 2004. The loan\nwill be released in two tranches as follows;\nTranche 1 of $10 million equivalent, upon\n(i)  notification of the establishment of a President\u2019s task force\nfor SMEs;\n(ii)  establishment of a deregulation committee and submission\nof deregulation studies on (a) a framework for evaluating\ntransactions costs, and (b) tax administration;\n(iii)  elimination of the banking turnover tax and Save-the-Nation\nContribution;\n(iv)  reduction of stamp duty on letters of credit from 2 percent to\n1  percent  and  reduction  in  national  security  levy  by  one\npercentage point;\n(v)  establishment  of  a  Cabinet  Subcommitee  to  develop  an\naction plan and modalities for the elimination of Sri Lanka\nTelecoms\u2019 monopoly in the provision of telephony services;\nand\n(vi)  establishment of a working group under the Chief Justice for\nlegal reform of the financial sector.", "v\nTranche 2 of $10 million equivalent, upon\n(i)  submission  of  a  national  strategy  paper,  acceptable  to\nADB,  for  SME  development  by  the  SME  task  force,\nincluding approval and gazetting by the Cabinet;\n(ii)  elimination  of  the  stamp  duty  on  letters  of  credit  and\ncorresponding unification of surcharges with import duty\nstructure;\n(iii)  submission of a tax reform strategy paper and action plan\nfor the medium term agreed upon with ADB;\n(iv)  implementation of the first phase of reduction in corporate\nincome tax, in accordance with a time table  agreed upon\nin the tax reform action plan;\n(v)  rationalization  of  the  incentive  structure  through\nharmonization of all tax incentives in the Inland Revenue\nAct; and,\n(vi)  elimination  of  Sri  Lanka  Telecoms\u2019  monopoly  in  the\nprovision of telephony services.\nExecuting\nAgency The  Executing  Agency  will  be  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and\nPlanning.\n                  Procurement and\nDisbursement The proceeds of the Program Loan will be utilized to finance the\nfull foreign exchange costs (excluding the local duties and taxes)\nof  imports  produced  in  and  procured  from  ADB\u2019s  member\ncountries, other than those specified in the list of ineligible item\nand imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources.\nCounterpart\nFunds The policy framework for SMESDP includes specific components\nthat bear distinct costs of structural adjustments. The counterpart\nfunds to be generated from the loan proceeds will be used to\nfinance the structural adjustment costs under SMESDP. In this\nconnection, the Government will ensure that social expenditures,\nespecially in the health and education sectors, will be maintained\nduring the program period.\nThe Investment Loan for the Business Services Support Facility (BSSF)\nLoan Amount\nand Terms  A  loan  of  SDR  4,742,000  drawn  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds\nresources, with the Government as Borrower, with a repayment\nperiod of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and with\nan interest rate of 1.0 percent during the grace period and 1.5", "vi\npercent thereafter. The loan will be used to finance the cost of\nconsulting  contracts  and  procurement  associated  with  the\noperations of the BSSF. The Government will bear the foreign\nexchange risk of the loan.\nTime Frame The project will start in January 2002 and will be completed by\nDecember 2004.\nExecuting\nAgency The Executing Agency will be the Ministry of Trade and Industry.\nProcurement and\nConsulting\nServices ADB-financed goods and services will be procured in accordance\nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Bidding documents will be\nprepared to ensure maximum competition. No individual procured\nitem is expected to cost more than $50,000. Consultants will be\nengaged following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.\nThe Investment Loan for the Lines of Credit\nLoan Amount\nand Terms A loan of $60 million, with the Government as Borrower, will be\nprovided  from  ADB's  ordinary  capital  resources  under  ADB's\nLIBOR-based lending facility. The loan will have a 15-year term,\nincluding a grace period of 3 years; an interest rate determined in\naccordance  with  ADB's  LIBOR-based  lending  facility;  a\ncommitment charge of 0.75 percent per annum; a front-end fee of\n1.0  percent;  conversion  options  that  may  be  exercised  in\naccordance with the terms of the draft Loan Agreement, the Loan\nRegulations, and ADB's Conversion Guidelines; and other terms\nand conditions set forth in the draft Loan Agreement.1\nTime Frame The  loan  will  start  in  January  2002  and  will  be  completed  by\nDecember 2006.\nExecuting\nAgency The  Executing  Agency  will  be  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and\nPlanning.\nADB\u2019s Partial Credit\nGuarantee A  commercial  cofinancing  of  up  to  $90  million  equivalent\nsupported by ADB\u2019s partial credit guarantee extended to HNB,\nSampath Bank, CBC, NDB and DFCC is proposed. The principal\npayment  will  be  guaranteed  by  ADB\u2019s  partial  credit  guarantee\n(PCG)  and  the  interest  payments  will  be  guaranteed  by  the\nGovernment. The Government will provide a counter guarantee\n                                                          \n1\nUntil 1 July 2002, the Borrower can choose either LIBOR-based lending or a pool-based single currency lending\nfacility in US dollars and if the LIBOR-based lending is chosen, the Borrower must select the currency of the loan.", "vii\nfor ADB\u2019s provision of a partial credit guarantee. In accordance\nwith the revised policy covering PCGs, ADB will charge for its own\naccount (i) a front-end fee of 90 basis points on the face value of\nthe PCG, and (ii) a PCG fee of 0.40 percent per annum against\nthe present value of the guarantee obligation. The Government\nwill charge a guarantee fee of 1 percent per annum against the\nface  value  of  the  ADB  guarantee,  and  a  guarantee  fee  of  1\npercent  per  annum  against  the  face  value  of  its  guarantee  of\ninterest payments.\nTechnical\nAssistance Technical assistance (TA) will be provided, at the request of the\nGovernment for $1.25 million, financed from the Japan Special\nFund, funded by the Government of Japan. The TA will include\nsupport  for  (i)  establishing  of  a  SME  baseline  survey  and\nassessments,  (ii)  preparing  of  deregulation  studies  by  the\nDeregulation Committee, (iii) preparing of a framework for secured\ntransactions, and (iv) promoting the use of ICT by SMEs.\nExecuting\nAgency The Executing Agency will be the Ministry of Trade and Industry.\nRisks and\nSafeguards There is a risk is that the enabling environment will remain biased\nagainst SMEs. This is mitigated by (i) a consultative process in\ndecision making; (ii) the establishment of the SME policy unit,\nwhich  will  periodically  review  the  enabling  environment,  (iii)  a\nderegulation committee that will develop deregulation proposals;\nand (iv) the Government\u2019s commitment to make a public response\nto  the  deregulation  committee\u2019s  report  through  Parliamentary\ndebate on its response, and the reasons for it.\nA  second  risk  is  that  the  market  for  BDS  does  not  respond\nsufficiently, thus limiting capacity building for SMEs. While this risk\nis judged to be minor, a related risk is  that the wrong elements of\nthe market respond, wasting resources that are used to solicit aid\nagency support, rather than serve the SME market productively.\nThis risk is mitigated by the flexible design of the facility for BDS\nsupport.  Surveys  and  other  methods  will  be  used  to  obtain\nfeedback and identify continuously the key supply- and demand-\nside areas needing stimulation.\nThird, an inherent risk is that policy and institutional reforms alone\nwill not ensure financing for firms with viable projects. This risk is\npartly mitigated by capacity building for SMEs that will make them\nbetter credit risks, and the provision of significant credit resources\nto financial institutions under the SDP for onlending to SMEs. The\nrisk is further mitigated by the project\u2019s requirement that banks\u2019\nadopt  credit  scoring  techniques  and  invest  in  ICT  and", "viii\nmanagement information systems to lower unit transaction costs\nof  lending  to  SMEs.    Finally,  legal  reform  that  will  strengthen\ncompetition among banks will mitigate this risk further still.\nFourth, banks may not be able to lend to SMEs on a sustainable\nbasis because of inability to access long-term funds. This implies\nthe continued need for aid agency or public sector support to\npromote financing. This risk is partly mitigated by changes to the\nlegal  framework,  which  will  permit  the  provision  of  public\nguarantees  to  a  wider  range  of  financial  institutions  for  the\npurpose of facilitating access to finance. However, in terms of\naccess to international capital markets, this risk cannot be fully\nmitigated so long as Sri Lanka is unable to obtain a sovereign\ndebt  rating,  for  which  an  end  to  the  ongoing  civil  strife  is\nnecessary.\nFinally,  adverse  transitional  consequences  of  restructuring  and\nlabor  retrenchment  could  provoke  resistance  from  affected\ngroups,  slow  the  pace  of  reforms,  and  jeopardize  their\nsustainability. This risk is mitigated by the Government\u2019s strong\ncommitment to the reform agenda as well as by the provision of\nfunding under the SDP to support transfer programs. In addition,\nmeasures taken to reduce economic rent seeking are expected to\nstrengthen public confidence in the reform program.", "I. THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on (i) proposed\nloans to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Small and Medium Enterprise\nSector Development Program (SMESDP), (ii) a partial credit guarantee (PCG) to selected\nparticipating credit institutions (PCIs), and (iii) a proposed technical assistance (TA) for Enabling\nSmall and Medium Enterprise (SME) Growth.\nII.  INTRODUCTION\n2. In 2000, the Government of Sri Lanka requested the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s)\nassistance to strengthen the performance of the SME sector as part of ongoing efforts to\nliberalize  and  diversify  the  economy,  improve  competitiveness,  and  promote  greater\nemployment and growth. An advisory TA for SME development was approved in December\n2000.1 A survey of 300 SMEs was conducted under the TA, as were a number of diagnostic\nstudies. The findings of the studies indicate that the main requirements of SME development\nare (i) an improved business environment through deregulation and reform of appropriate laws,\nregulations, and institutions that either favor large firms or act as impediments to business in\ngeneral; (ii) better access by SMEs to business services provided by private sector providers so\nas to overcome deficiencies in capabilities and access to markets and technology; and (iii)\nimproved access to finance at market terms to catalyze investments. The diagnostics also\nstressed the importance of institutional capacity for developing a coordinated strategy for SME\nsupport, currently absent in Sri Lanka, and the need to apply the test of sustainability to all\npolicy and institutional interventions. The findings are consistent with international best practice,\nwhich has moved from a focus on provision of subsidized credit and TA to SMEs, to one which\nstresses market forces and fee-based services within a strategic framework that links policy\nreform, access to credit, and capacity building.\n3. The assessment of the SME sector in Sri Lanka was undertaken in an environment that\nincluded the (i) coming into effect of a free trade agreement with India in March 2000, (ii)\nexpectation of further liberalization of the Indian economy, (iii) phasing out of quotas under the\nMulti-Fiber  Agreement  by  2005,  and  (iv)  implementation  of  World  Trade  Organization\ncommitments  by  the  same  year.  These  changes  herald  an  external  or  global  context  of\ndomestic economic activity characterized by the increasing mobility of capital and the trend for\nproduction systems to organize across international boundaries. This has been helped by a\ndecline in barriers to trade across a wide range of products and economies.\n4. As a result of the changes, the potential for attracting foreign direct investment has\nincreased, as have opportunities for developing new products and geographic markets. At the\nsame time, the implication for policy makers is that it becomes less relevant\u2014if not infeasible\u2014\nto use firm- or subsector-specific selective interventions to try and manage domestic activity\nimbedded in a global context. In fact, a clear role for policy makers is to provide an enabling\nenvironment that supports dynamic firms seeking to make investment decisions in response to\nopportunities in domestic and international markets.\n5. In response to the Government\u2019s request for assistance in this undertaking, a Fact-\nFinding Mission visited Sri Lanka during 9-25 May 2001, followed by an Appraisal Mission\n                                                          \n1\nTA 3578-SRI: Small and Medium Enterprise Development, for $400,000 approved in December 2000.", "2\nduring 12-31 August 2001.2 The Missions reached an understanding with the Government on a\npackage of policy and institutional reforms that is to be supported by the ADB loans and the\nimplementation arrangements. The Sector Development Program (SDP) approach will provide\nflexibility  and  continuity  in  implementing  the  required  policy  and  institutional  reforms.  The\nunderstanding reached with the Government was reconfirmed by a Consultation Mission fielded\non 11-12 October 2001. The development policy letter, policy matrix for the sector development\nprogram, the program framework, and the organizational framework are in Appendixes 1, 2, 3\nand 4.\nIII.  THE SECTOR\nA. The  Macroeconomic Context\n6. Following  a  number  of  years  of  growth  at  about  5  percent  per  annum,  economic\nperformance slowed in 2001, with the growth rate expected to fall to about 1 percent. This is\nlargely the result of external factors including higher oil prices, slower growth in the world\neconomy and adverse weather conditions that have affected agriculture. A further blow to the\neconomy was the decline in tourism revenues following the attack on Colombo airport in July\n2001. This trend could be exacerbated in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks in the United\nStates if this, along with other factors, leads to a further slowdown in the world economy. In\nparallel  with  measures  being  implemented  in  developed  economies,  the  Government  is\npreparing  a  package  of  stimulus  measures,  which,  by  promoting  greater  investment  and\nconsumption, should help in facilitating faster recovery.\n7. However, the country\u2019s macroeconomic imbalances are a cause for continuing concern\nin view of the larger budget and current account deficits and the depletion of foreign exchange\nreserves. To address these imbalances, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved a 14-\nmonth standby arrangement of about $253 million in April 2001. While the Government has\ngenerally achieved the performance targets for the end of June 2001, there is concern that it\nmay have difficulty in doing so for the remaining half of 2001. An IMF review mission is due to\nevaluate progress made in November 2001. A key issue is improvements to the financial\nposition of major public sector institutions.\nB.  Sector Description and Recent Performance\n8. Sri Lanka benefited from the shift in the late 1970s from a strategy of inward-oriented,\npublic-sector-led  growth  to  one  which  stressed  growth  of  the  private  sector  and  greater\nopenness to the international economy. The liberalization of the economy which followed was\nsupported by a variety of measures to promote exports and divest the public sector\u2019s ownership\nin a wide range of sectors through the 1980s and much of the 1990s.\n9. The sustained liberalization of the economy was accompanied by high investment levels\nand accumulation of capital, increased productivity, and strong employment growth, especially\nin private sector manufacturing. By 1993, productivity in the private manufacturing sector had\nsurpassed that in the public sector. The gain in productivity was due partly to increased use of\ninputs such as labor and capital, and partly to improvements in technical or total productivity\u2014or\nthe efficiency with which the inputs of capital and labor were used. Thus, during 1977-1998,\n                                                          \n2 The Mission comprised J. Ahmed, Senior Economist/Mission Leader; D. Hodgkinson, Sr. Cofinancing Officer; A.\nGoswami, Counsel; E. Zhukov, Programs Economist; and S. Chanmugam, Project Analyst.", "3\nproductivity grew by 9.2 percent per annum with a strong relationship emerging between the\ngrowth of productivity and the liberalization of trade and investment policy.\n10. The decades of reform have led to significant structural change in the economy. As a\nproportion of the total output, agriculture declined between 1978 and 2000, from a little more\nthan 30 percent to a little less than 20 percent. Over the same period, manufacturing declined\nfrom 18.4 to 16.8 percent as a proportion of economic activity. In contrast, gains were made by\nthe service sector, which grew by more than 10 percent over the same period.  In the last five\nyears however, the manufacturing sector outperformed the service sector and grew faster than\nthe economy as a whole. Thus, while the service sector now dominates economic activity,\nindustry remains an important sector, particularly when measured by recent changes in output.\nThis pattern is typical of middle-level developing countries.\n11. While SMEs have benefited from reforms and economic growth, many still  exhibit a\nrelatively low level of technology, and poor management, financial and accounting practices.\nThey also face significant difficulties in accessing information, markets and finance.  Limitations\nin capacity are compounded by a business and regulatory environment that raises costs and still\nprovides unnecessary hurdles to the establishment and operation of businesses.\n12. The performance of SMEs is not easy to measure as definitions of SMEs have varied\nconsiderably  over  the  years  and  among  institutions.  The  present  analysis  shows  that  the\nbusiness sector in Sri Lanka is divided into the following: (i) small-scale enterprises with 5-49\nemployees,  (ii)  medium-scale  enterprises  with  50-149  employees,  and  (iii)  large  scale\nenterprises with more than 150 employees. On this basis, and in terms of the ISIC classification\nof  industries,  SMEs  are  found  in  all  subsectors  of  the  economy  with  a  concentration  in\nmanufacturing  sector  activities.    SMEs  are  widely  spread  across  urban,  rural,  and  estate\nsectors. Within the urban sector their presence is predominantly in secondary and tertiary type\neconomic activities, while in the rural and estate sectors they are heavily concentrated in\nprimary and secondary type economic activities.\n13. In manufacturing, SMEs account for 95 percent of establishments, 25 percent of output\nand 34 percent of employment. If knitting and wearing apparel are subtracted\u2014both subsectors\nwith large-scale producers\u2014the SME share of employment in the manufacturing sector rises to\n49 percent of the total. Thirty percent of SMEs produce for export markets. There are numerous\nsmall exporters, and the share of value added by SMEs is high in sectors where the ratio of\nexports to total production is high. A similar result holds with skilled labor: sectors with high\nskilled labor inputs are those in which SMEs have a high proportion of value added.3 This\nsuggests a relatively dynamic sector, something confirmed by the ADB survey findings that\nshow that two thirds of SMEs consider themselves to be profitable.\n14. On the other hand, medium-size firms account for only 6 percent of establishments\u2014the\nmissing middle that is typical of most developing member countries. Furthermore, the output\nand employment in the SME sector have declined since 1983, from 30 percent and 47 percent\nrespectively. This is not a cause for concern if SMEs are subject to dynamic change and grow\ninto larger firms. In Indonesia, 25 percent of the output of large firms is found to be that of firms\nthat were once SMEs and had grown. The concern in Sri Lanka is the presence of regulatory\nand other constraints that impede this kind of transition.\n                                                          \n3\n  Based on studies prepared during project preparation.", "4\nC. Constraints and Issues\n1. Lack of an Overall Policy for the SME Sector\n15. The principal constraints at the strategy and policy level are\n(i)  absence of a coherent SME sector strategy or development plan,\n(ii)  lack of private sector participation in policy formulation and administrative reform,\nand\n(iii)  lack of monitoring and evaluation capacity to measure policy impact and compile\ndata to serve as a basis for future policy decisions.\n16. With numerous, independent initiatives in support of SMEs, the absence of an overall\ncoordinating  mechanism  leads  to  loss  of  efficiency\u2014due  to  duplication  of  efforts  and  no\napplication of lessons learned\u2014and lack of an effective strategy for the SME sector as a whole.\nThere  is  therefore  an  opportunity  to  establish  a  mechanism  that  would  coordinate  the\ndevelopment efforts for the sector. In particular, there would be major value to a high-level\nstatement of the nation\u2019s SME policy that is periodically updated and reaffirmed. Given the\nabsence of reliable data on the sector, there is a need to develop of an information base\u2014\nregularly updated\u2014that will collect information on the sector to allow policy makers and SMEs to\nbe better informed and hence more effective in their continuing efforts to develop the sector.\n2.  High Transaction Costs\n17. SMEs  experience  difficulties  with  the  complexity  of  the  regulatory  framework.  A\nsignificant number of firms cite the need to make unofficial payments. Medium and large firms\nassign an average of two full-time staff to deal with regulatory compliance issues. The cost of\ncomplying with the regulatory framework, in terms of both time and money 4 shows the economy\nsuffers from high transaction costs, both in starting new companies and operating existing ones.\nA recent cross-country study of 75 countries found that starting a company imposed a cost of\nabout 9 percent of per capita gross domestic product (GDP) in Sri Lanka in terms of compliance\ncosts and use of time. In contrast, in most middle income countries, this cost was found to be\nabout 1-2 percent of per capita GDP. This cost is negligibly small in developed economies. At\nthe country specific level, ADB\u2019s studies show that an average of 82 days is needed to obtain all\nclearances to start a business (although in practice firms do not wait for the official clearance to\nstart) at an average cost of about SLRs5,800. Both the international and the ADB studies\nsuggest that these costs are the result of a regulatory structure that has evolved in response to\nopportunities to generating additional income for state functionaries. For SMEs, this difficulty\ntends to be in respect of getting approvals for environmental issues, connections to utility, etc.,\nmuch of which is facilitated for large firms by the Board of Investment (BOI).\n18. Large firms are better able to handle transaction costs and are able to spread them over\na larger output base. SMEs are less able to do this and suffer disproportionately, leading many\nto opt out of the formal sector or choose to remain small. Transaction costs thus influence the\nsize of firms: in high-cost economies firms choose to integrate vertically and thus do internally a\nrange  of  activities  which,  in  a  more  transparent  regulatory  framework,  they  would  have\n                                                          \n4\nTotal transactions costs will include the cost of production as well as that of regulatory compliance; furthermore, a\ndistinction is made between compliance costs for start-up and for continued business.", "5\ncontracted out to other, usually smaller, firms. A major and systematic review of the regulatory\nstructure  to  identify  and  remove  the  major  bottlenecks  to  capacity  expansion  and  new\ninvestments will reduce the costs of doing business and improve the prospects for SMEs to\ngrow and establish links with other firms. Efforts to develop subcontracting linkages between\nlarge and small firms will benefit as will prospects for SME clusters as these also presuppose\nservice relationships between the cluster and large firms. A number of developing member\ncountries have established bodies for deregulation which are typically tasked with preparing of\nstudies and investor road maps for the Government  to simplify business approval procedures\nand reduce compliance costs and the costs of doing business in various sectors. Such bodies\nrepresent cutting-edge responses to the need to maintain competitiveness in the international\neconomy.\n3.  Complex Incentive Structure\n19. The tax system in Sri Lanka is a crucial element of the incentive structure. Given the\ncomplexity and uncertainty of the present tax system, many small firms choose to remain\ninformal. For such firms the key issues are high transactions costs from the system of archaic\nstamp duties that cover both imports and domestic goods, tax rates that are higher than rates\navailable to large firms, and complexity that leads to uncertainty as well as procedural difficulties\nin compliance.\n20. Stamp duties are inefficient tax instruments. They are levied on all instruments and\ndocuments required for proof of a transaction in Sri Lanka. Some 39 categories of stamp duties\nexist for bank checks, bills of exchange, travelers checks, credit cards, mortgages, insurance\npolicies, salaries, commercial invoices, construction contracts, bonds, bank guarantees, etc. All\ncould be eliminated with major improvements in efficiency. About 60 percent of revenues from\nstamp duties are collected (by Customs) on letters of credit and commercial invoices and from\nissue of Treasury Stamps.\n21. Tax and investment incentives and exemptions are announced in the budget, sometimes\nprovided  under  the  auspices  of  the  Inland  Revenue  Act  by  the  Treasury,  and  sometimes\nthrough the BOI Act. The budget frequently leaves unclear the authority for the provision of the\nincentive. BOI has some 23 categories of firms and sectors  that receive incentives in the form\nof lower corporate tax rates, duty exemptions, and tax holidays of various lengths. The Treasury\nprovides a similar range of incentives for a similarly wide range of sectors.  These incentives\ntypically cannot be accessed by SMEs, resulting in a situation in which SMEs are liable to\nhigher corporate tax rates than paid by most large firms.\n22. The most serious effect of the complex incentive structure is in terms of allocation\nefficiency; investment activity is distorted between investments favored and not, and there is no\nlevel playing field. This issue is especially relevant given the use of different rules for different\ncompanies.  The  current  incentive  structure  also  imposes  great  administrative  strain.  The\nadministrative capacity at the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) is particularly limited, with\nmany enterprises benefiting from tax holidays not even filing income tax returns, and the office\nhas difficulty in keeping track of incentives.\n23. The  system  of  direct  taxes  includes  the  National  Security  Levy  and  the  Financial\nInstitutions Levy. Revenue from the National Security Levy accounts for 2.7 percent of GDP; for\nthe Financial Institutions Levy, it is 0.1 percent of GDP; and that the turnover retail tax by the\nprovincial councils, 0.15 percent of GDP. Turnover taxes increase the incentive for vertical\nintegration of activities within firms. In contrast, the goods and services tax (GST) is a VAT-style", "6\ntax. A major policy objective of tax policy reform is to eliminate turnover taxes, increase the\nGST,  and  expand  its  coverage  by  eliminating  the  sectors  that  are  currently  exempted\n(electricity, public transportation, petroleum, and agriculture).\n4.  Tax Administration and Public Sector Governance\n24. Both  SMEs  and  large  firms  cite  tax  administration  and  the  customs  as  major\nimpediments to doing business. The IRD\u2019s outdated organizational structure focuses on type of\ntax,  rather  than  function,  and  prevents  specialization  and  improvement  of  skills.  This\norganizational structure and a fragmented computer system impede communication within the\norganization  and  reduce  productivity.  The  high  status  of  specific  departments  (e.g.,  Large\nTaxpayer Unit) affects staffing problems and morale, and transfers result in loss of accumulated\nskills. Many units lack staff, and many others lack skilled workers. Outdated administrative\nprocedures and weak enforcement mechanisms have resulted in low compliance and very\nlimited success in widening the tax net and in pursuing defaulters. The tax net has been eroded\nthrough exemptions, especially those provided by BOI. There is duplication in key activities and\nservices that IRD and Customs provide.  The public has a poor perception of IRD.\n25.  While IRD clearly needs to be restructured, care needs to be taken to not repeat the\ndrawbacks and failures of previous reform efforts in Sri Lanka and elsewhere. Shortcomings in\nthe traditional model of civil service reform has led to the recognition that insufficient attention\nhas been paid to appropriately structuring incentives within the public sector and in building up\nits human capital and administrative capacity. This is underscored by the experience of a\nnumber  of  developing  and  developed  economies,  which  have  stressed  the  importance  of\nautonomous, professionally run, and performance-based public sector institutions in promoting\nthe productivity of the private sector. The key principles emerging from this experience follows:\n(i)  Key services must be delivered by discrete, autonomous institutions or agencies.\n(ii)  Agencies must control their budgets, personnel systems and management\npractices.\n(iii)  To attract talents needed, agencies Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) and other\nstaff must be paid adequately.\n(iv)  CEOs and the agency must have performance contracts.\n(v)  Agencies must develop annual performance targets and 3-5 year strategic plans.\n(vi)  Periodical reviews must be held to determine agency performance.\n26. When applied effectively, public sector reforms based on these principles have had\nstriking impacts in increasing operational efficiency. This is being increasingly observed in tax\nadministration in many developing countries, which are moving to simplify tax policies and\nstrengthen  administrative  capacities  by  establishing  of  functionally  oriented,  autonomous\nauthorities.", "7\n5.  Limited Market for Strengthening Business Capabilities\n27. Promoting the demand and efficient supply of business development services (BDS) is\ncritical to ensuring a dynamic SME sector.5 The demand  varies across sectors, and is strongest\nin the textiles, wearing apparel, and leather sector. Most SMEs value the use of BDS for project\npreparation. Smaller firms prefer to seek BDS support for long-term issues such as marketing\nand gaining access to technology. Available BDS support ranges from traditional forms of class\nroom training on entrepreneurship and marketing to sophisticated attempts to foster public-\nprivate partnerships in providing of business information services. While there are schemes for\ndifferent types of SMEs (starters, non-growers/slow growers, and fast growers), there does not\nappear to be an overall strategy that aims at developing assistance packages in accordance\nwith the needs of specific types of SMEs. Broadly, Government agencies are most prominent in\nproviding  support  to  starters  and  non-growers/slow  growers,  while  nongovernment\norganizations (NGOs) concentrate on microenterprises with the business chambers playing a\nmore important role in providing assistance to fast-growing firms.\n28. Most Government programs can be characterized as pilot projects with a limited number\nof beneficiaries. These programs are typically one-shot interventions with budgets and human\nresources not allowing for return visits and further support at a later stage. Outreach and\nparticipation rates of these programs remain low, especially in the rural areas. Based on direct\ndelivery  of  services,  these  schemes  do  not  charge  fees  and  therefore  have  no  credible\nmechanism for feedback, assessment of impact, or redesign. They are primarily supply driven\nand are unable to provide SMEs with the services they value. Similarly, aid-funded programs\u2014\neven those that provide assistance to BDS providers\u2014have often tended to be supply-driven\nand dependent on subsidized funds. This has resulted in the source of finance - the aid agency\n- being seen as the ultimate client, rather than the SMEs. Organizations such as associations\nand chambers of commerce are not always clear on their role in promoting SME growth,\nparticularly whether or not they should stimulate the use of BDS or deliver BDS services. These\ninstitutions are missing an opportunity to play a critical, beneficial, and financially rewarding role\nin brokering the use of BDS by their members.\n29. Partly because the sector is receiving considerable external support, there is reasonably\nwidespread access to BDS throughout the country. In addition, some aid agencies are now\nfocusing on sustainability and have adopted the for-fee concept. Several for-profit private firms\nare operating throughout the country and are active in product development and adaptation for\nthe different needs and segments of the market. However, private sector BDS providers are not\ncarrying out sufficient product adaptation or market assessments to develop their markets. Too\noften the same product is being presented to too broad a range of clients. Moving closer to the\nclient needs on a case-by-case basis is required. The important information technology (IT)\nsector is poised to assist the growth of SMEs. The availability of IT-related BDS services is\nimproving, resulting in lower costs and more opportunities for the SME sector as a whole.\n30. Substantially higher participation rates will require increased involvement of the private\nsector in delivering BDS to SMEs. A key issue is the impact of direct provision of BDS by the\npublic  sector\u2014whether  Government  or  externally  funded,  whether  on  subsidized  or  on\n                                                          \n5  In the context of this project, BDS are defined as a broad range of nonfinance services\u2014of both a strategic and\noperational nature\u2014critical to the entry, survival, and growth of SMEs. BDS are a dynamic response to the needs\nof the market. As such, BDS encompass more than training and management consulting, and also include, e.g.,\nmarketing services, outsourcing activities (e.g., payroll firms, accounting); information technology (IT) services,\ntechnical services (e.g., design, engineering, etc.); finance brokering, and more. The mix is constantly changing\nas the SME market evolves and grows.", "8\ncommercial terms\u2014on the market for local providers. Best practice suggests that direct public\nsector provision of BDS undermines the growth potential of local commercial providers from the\nprivate sector. The alternative is to focus on the development of a well-functioning BDS market\nthrough interventions that facilitate and strengthen the supply side while helping to stimulate\ndemand by SMEs.\n6. Government Provision of BDS: The Industrial Development Board\n31. The Industrial Development Board (IDB) is a major but inefficient provider of BDS. It is\nnow a part of the Ministry of Trade and Industry and was established in 1969 during the import\nsubstitution phase of development. It retains a staff of 630 of whom 70 are extension workers,\nand offers a wide range of services to SMEs.  IDB has developed a range of programs and\nprojects for SMEs that include (i) incubator schemes for SME start-ups, (ii) setup of one-step\nregional  industrial  services  to  facilitate  quick  and  easy  access  to  information,  (iii)  young\nentrepreneurship program to guide university graduates to successfully develop their own small\nbusiness, and (iv) the Wasantha SME facilitation program.\n32.  IDB relies on the Government for 80 percent of its budget and many of its services\ngenerate little demand or revenue from SMEs.  IDB has substantial technical know-how that is\nnot effectively used for SMEs. To be a more effective organization, it should be restructured and\nrefocused on an appropriate target group of firms and on an appropriate mission. IDB will need\nto charge fees for its services in the future and refocus its activities to facilitating SMEs and\nSME service providers. IDBs new role is expected \u2013 over the long run - to involve a substantial\nreduction in its staff through voluntary schemes for retirement.\n7. Market and Institutional Development for Sustainable Finance\na.  Banks and Other Institutions\n33. The Sri Lankan financial sector has 27 commercial banks, 42 depository institutions (a\nnational savings bank, 24 finance companies, and 17 regional rural development banks), three\nstate-sponsored  long-term  financial  institutions  (2  DFIs  and  one  state  mortgage  bank)  six\ninsurance companies and two public pension funds. The commercial banks comprise 2 state, 7\nlocal,  and  18  foreign  banks.  During  the  last  decade,  the  financial  sector  represented  a\nsubstantial part of the GDP growing to more than 10 percent of the economy. In the last five\nyears, the commercial banks\u2019 total assets grew from 14 to 18 percent annually from SLRs389.7\nbillion in 1996 to about SLRs678 billion in 2000. Total loan assets increased in about the same\nannual  percentages  from  SLRs202.4  billion  in  1996  to  SLRs356.6  billion  in  2000.  Total\ncommercial bank deposits also increased at a healthy clip from SLRs261.9 billion in 1996 to\nSLRs445.6 billion at end-2000.\n34. State-owned banks hold almost 60 percent of total banking assets, and the five largest\nprivate commercial banks hold more than 30 percent of the remainder. All compete for deposits\nfrom the public. The state banks have a nationwide branch network, but remain highly inefficient\nand  massively  undercapitalized.  The  major  private  commercial  banks  have  widened  their\nnetworks to cover almost the entire country, including Jaffna. The three leading commercial\nbanks \u2013 Hatton National Bank (HNB), Commercial Bank of Ceylon (CBC) and Sampath Bank\n(SB) have over 200 branches in aggregate nationwide. CBC and Sampath Bank are seeking\ngreater  prudential  safety  and  security  through  diversifying  what  were  once  loan  portfolios\nconcentrated in financing large enterprises. HNB has been an innovator in SME lending in Sri", "9\nLanka and one of the earliest to recognize that lending to SMEs can be profitable and provide a\ncushion to the bank in times of economic decline.\nb. Absence of Level Playing Field for DFIs and Commercial Banks\n35. High unit lending costs to SMEs and higher perceived risks limit bank financing to the\nsector. Yet international experience indicates the role that policy reform and capacity building\ncan play in promoting the market and institutional development needed to ensure sustainable\nfinance for SMEs at commercial terms. In terms of the market, the objective is to use a variety of\ninstruments\u2014including  promotion  of  competition,  provisions  of  public  guarantees,  etc.\u2014to\ninduce financial institutions to direct greater flows of financial resources on commercial terms to\nmeet SME needs. In terms of institutional development, the objective is to ensure that these\ninstitutions have appropriate lending methodologies, trained staff, ICT, and internal incentive\nsystems to serve the market effectively.\n36. Market and institutional development requires that both DFIs and private commercial\nbanks  in  Sri  Lanka  are  equally  encouraged  to  provide  lines  of  credit  to  SMEs  without\ndiscriminatory impediments to either DFIs or private banks. Historically, the DFIs have met the\nSME sector\u2019s credit needs but this is no longer sustainable and access needs to be widened to\nthe private commercial banking sector. The current legal environment in Sri Lanka poses some\nimpediments to this. Stemming from the Banking Act of 1988 (Act No. 30 of 1988) as amended,\nDFIs are unable to provide foreign currency loans in the same fashion as private banks. This\nmay have significance for purposes of lending to, for example, export-oriented SMEs that would\nhave demand for foreign currency loans. In this regard, the competitive pressures between DFIs\nand private banks with regard to foreign currency loans to SMEs are artificially constrained by a\nlegal impediment that no longer matches the reality of the market-driven blurring of the lines in\nthe operations of DFIs and private banks.\n37. The need for nondiscriminatory treatment of commercial banks and DFIs is underscored\nby the nature of institutional and market development in the financial sector in Sri Lanka. This is\ncharacterized by an increasing blurring of the line between DFIs and private banks. Sri Lanka\u2019s\nDFIs  are  increasingly  moving  in  the  direction  of  universal  banking.  Thus,  the  National\nDevelopment Bank of Sri Lanka (NDB) has taken over the banking operations of ABN AMRO\nBank in Sri Lanka and obtained regulatory approval to form NDB Bank as a wholly owned\nsubsidiary. Second, DFCC Bank (formerly the Development Finance Corporation of Ceylon)\nowns  29.9  percent  of  CBC  and  the  Government  through  the  Insurance  Corporation  owns\nanother 29.9 percent of CBC, which is treated as a private bank. Second, in the context of SME\ndevelopment, it will be necessary to channel credit by private banks to SMEs alongside the DFIs\ncredit to SMEs. This is important not merely in terms of the overall credit demands of the\npotentially dynamic SME sector but also because of the need to allow SMEs to grow into larger\ncorporations in the portfolio of private banks.\n38. Commercial interests and competition for deposit and loan customers have led a number\nof the commercial banks to lend more aggressively to SMEs despite a shortage of resources\navailable to do so. Banks such as Sampath, HNB and CBC are playing a leading role in this\nregard. These banks have developed several deposit products to reduce their matching risk for\nthis lending. There are now time deposit mechanisms that allow banks to fund term loan\nfacilities of five years or longer and there have been several issues of debentures by PCIs.\nBranch  networks  have  also  been  extended  into  rural  areas.  Although  encouraging,  these\nresource mobilization activities will first and foremost fund activities that carry less relative risk", "10\nfor the banks, such as housing loans, and then be available for lending to SMEs. Also, their\nvolume is limited, given the relatively high short-term interest rates.\n39. Though considerable ground remains to be covered, efforts at learning about SMEs,\nphysically locating branches closer to the areas of economic activity, and raising funding for on-\nlending to SMEs are helping to mitigate the problem of access to finance. Despite these positive\ndevelopments, bankers still report a dearth of bankable deals and a heavy reliance on real\nestate as security. Training in SME lending would benefit the PCIs. While PCIs have received\nTA  over  the  years  in  lending  techniques  based  on  cash  flow,  such  training  tended  to\nconcentrate on structuring the loan repayments according to the projected cash flow; insufficient\nattention was paid to the important skill of counseling. Additionally, there remains the problem of\nhigh unit transaction costs in processing relatively small SME loans.\nc. Use of Information Technology and Credit Scoring\n40. Promoting the use of IT and credit scoring is a powerful way to minimize the high\ntransaction costs associated with SME loan management, a key constraint to greater and\nsustained lending to the sector.  Credit scoring software allows a bank to achieve a faster, more\nconsistent series of decisions and reduces bank administrative costs for smaller loans. Prudent\nuse of properly developed loan scoring methods has the potential to reduce loan processing\ntime from 6 to 2 weeks down to a few days for most SME loans. The second benefit of credit-\nscoring software is that it is a tool that promotes consistency across the bank. One danger of a\nmanual credit investigation process is that the final loan decision may be skewed by the internal\nincentive system of a bank. For example, when bank staff members, such as loan officers and\nbank  managers,  receive  financial  incentives  for  extending  new  loans,  they  will  frequently\nconcentrate on quantity rather than seek out quality loans with a high probability of repayment.\nThe use of credit-scoring technology can remove a substantial proportion of the discretion from\nloan officers and branch managers, to the overall benefit of the institution.\n41. The  benefits  of  credit  scoring  are  maximized  through  use  of  integrated  computer\nsystems. A modern computer system is able to track loan quality indicators that are ordinarily\ndifficult to obtain in a timely manner by manual calculation. A useful indicator is the portfolio at\nrisk (PAR). PAR shows the quality of the loan portfolio and, by association, the effectiveness or\notherwise of the overall loan management policies of the bank. Well-managed banks have a low\nPAR and vice versa. Systems such as Globus are able to track PAR on loans at individual loan\nand branch levels. Globus also allows senior managers to directly review the PAR of the loan\naccounts of the responsible loan officer. Importantly, as PAR information is available at loan\nofficer level, it is relatively straightforward to develop an incentive system that links PAR to a\nloan officers/branch managers\u2019 bonus scheme.\nd. Access to Nonbank Finance\n42. In the medium term, a dynamic SME sector will need access to not only bank finance,\nbut to nonbank finance as well. While the latter is often cheaper, it requires a legal provision for\nthe use of movables for collateral.  The absence in Sri Lanka of a modern legal framework for\ncreating, prioritizing, and enforcing of security interests in movable property (also known as a\nsecured transactions legal framework) is a critical factor in the SMEs\u2019 lack of access to readily\navailable, cheap, and long-term credit. This absence is particularly acute for SMEs, since they,\nunlike larger enterprises, are less likely to have immovable property that can be offered as\ncollateral to secure loans from creditors.", "11\n43. One of the effects of the lack of an upgraded secured transactions legal framework is\nthat sources of credit are concentrated on bank credit since the legal system does not allow for\na diversified set of potential creditors, such as suppliers of goods, to take effective security over\nmovable  property.  Debtors  are  unable  to  use  their  inventories  and  accounts  receivable\neffectively as collateral for credit from such nonbank creditors.\n44. A review of recent legal reform efforts in Sri Lanka indicates that such efforts have\nfocused on loan enforcement reforms alone. Thus efforts have been made to expedite debt\nrecovery in the courts through reforms like the Hypothecary Action under Mortgage Act No. 6 of\n1949 as amended, and the Debt Recovery Special Provisions Act No. 2 of 1990. These have\ncontinued to be dependent on the court system. As such, they cannot offer to SMEs improved\naccess  to  credit  based  on  movable  property  collateral.  This  is  because  even  in  industrial\ncountries with refined security interest regimes, a court\u2019s disposition time can be too long and\nwill not allow total collection time and costs to come within a range that would allow movable\nproperty to effectively serve as collateral for credit.  Even efforts on so-called parate execution\nremedy  for  creditors  outside  the  court  system  have  been  restricted  to  particular  financial\ninstitutions. The inability of such reforms to fuel SME development is not unexpected since such\npartial reform of the secured transactions regime actually limits access to credit by hampering\nnonbank creditors, who extend credit to SME clients in whom banks have limited or no interest.\n8. Limited Use of IT by SMEs\n45. IT can help SMEs by reducing the costs of doing business, improving linkages with the\nglobal  economy,  and  spreading  information  and  knowledge  to  remote  areas.  The  limited\ntelecommunications  infrastructure  is  a  major  constraint  to  growth  of  IT  applications.  The\nabsence of a level playing field for commercial users and providers of telecommunications, and\nthe virtual monopoly of voice telecommunications held by Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT) compound\nthis problem and are reflected in the relatively high cost of telephone communications. The legal\nframework is yet to be firmly established and language is perceived to be a barrier to growth of\nthe sector as is the scarcity of trained human resources.\n46. Aside from the onetime costs associated with computer purchase, the greatest barrier to\nthe take-up of the Internet is the recurring costs associated with Internet access. Typically, 15\nhours  of  local  call  time  to  a  provider  will  cost  $13.05  per  month.  Over  the  full  year,  call\nconnection charges alone will amount to $156.60, or 20 percent of gross national product per\ncapita. This places Internet use well beyond the reach of the average Sri Lankan. SLT\u2019s role as\nthe  only  purveyor  of  voice  communications  is  partly  responsible  for  these  high  costs.  In\nparticular, its monopoly of the independent gateway prevents the possibility for reductions in\ninternet access costs.  Without these reductions, even simple innovations such as internet cafes\nare unlikely to flourish.\nD.  Government Objectives and Strategy\n47. The Government sees private sector development as the main means of achieving\nsustainable economic growth and reaching its Vision 2010 target of 7-8 percent growth per\nannum.  Reforms have been undertaken related to private and SMEs development with the\nassistance of ADB, e.g., through the Private Sector Development Program adopted in 2000.\nThese reforms have contributed to financial sector development, privatization, reducing labor\nmarket rigidities, and promoting competition. However, Sri Lanka still faces challenges related to\ndiversification  of  the  economy,  improving  competitiveness,  and  expanding  employment", "12\nopportunities.  The  Government  feels  that  SMEs  will  play  an  increasingly  important  role  in\nmeeting these challenges.\n48. In view of the importance of SMEs to the economy, the Government is embarking on\nfurther policy and institutional reforms to create a dynamic SME sector. It is felt that a new\nstrategy is needed to contend with the emerging challenges both domestically and abroad. The\nimportance of providing a level playing field in terms of a more conducive business environment\nfree of bureaucratic impediments is recognized. In addition, over the long term the Government\nwill reform tax (and customs) administration.  A key concern is that rigidities in these institutions\npromote  evasion  and  informality  generally  while  being  especially  onerous  for  SMEs.\nFurthermore, they continue to constrain the free and efficient flow of goods and services and\nhence limit the gains from policy reform. This represents recognition, and reversal, of a reform\nstrategy that ignored these institutions while seeking to compensate for their shortcomings by\ncreating parallel regimes for tax (and customs) maintained by BOI. This process is initiated\nunder SMESDP which both completes important reforms of the tax system and, through the\nDeregulation Committee, provides a mechanism for managing further regulatory reform over the\nmedium term.\n49. It is recognized also that shrinking public sector budgets no longer permit large-scale\nprovision of subsidized assistance to promote SMEs. At the same time the Government is\naware that absence of full and efficient markets in capacity building and finance for SMEs\nremains important bottlenecks to the sector. In this context the Government\u2019s strategy stresses\nthe development of efficient markets for business services for SMEs. This will be balanced, over\nthe longer term, by the rationalization and downsizing of IDB, the major conduit for public\nprovision of BDS. While the public sector will play an important role in managing the reform\nprocess, a greater stress is placed on private sector and SME inputs in the policy formulation\nand decision-making process.\n50. In  terms  of  access  to  finance  the  Government\u2019s  strategy  is  to  promote  greater\ncompetition, incentives for capacity building in banks, combined with selective provision of\npublic guarantees for the purpose of accessing capital markets. Over the longer term, it will also\ndevelop the legal framework for secured transactions to facilitate SME access to non-bank\nfinance.  This will set the stage for the use of securitized  lending.\nE.  External Assistance to the Sector\n51. ADB, Japan, and the World Bank continue to be the largest sources of aid to Sri Lanka,\nbut significant assistance also continues to be provided by bilateral funding agencies (Appendix\n5).  Due  to  the  significant  economic  and  financial  impact  of  the  civil  conflict  and  the\nGovernment\u2019s efforts to reduce the budget deficit, aid-financed projects constitute a significant\nproportion of the overall public sector investment program.\n52. The Japan Bank for International Cooperation has a low-interest line of credit of $40\nmillion in place for small and micro-size firms. The Japan International Cooperation Agency\n(JICA)  has  prepared  a  proposal  for  donor  financing  of  a  scheme  for  support  to  the\nmanufacturing  sector.  This  scheme  envisages  the  provision  of  coordinated  assistance  to\nstrengthen technology acquisition by firms, and support for particular clusters of firms in specific\nsubsectors (e.g. gems, rubber, plastics, etc.) JICA also proposes to provide BDS to firms initially\non a grant basis, support for an incubation scheme for the IT sector, a fund for venture capital,\nand a system of credit guarantees for use by banks. The Government is considering the JICA\nproposal.", "13\n53. Business  development  services  for  SMEs,  assistance  for  business  start-ups,  and\nvocational  training-sometimes  specifically  targeted  towards  women-receive  support  from  a\nnumber  of  aid  agencies  including  the  German  Government,  and  the  International  Labour\nOrganization (ILO) supports vocational training programs through its TA window. One of its\nvocational  training  programs  focuses  on  rural  women.  The  Sri  Lanka\u2013German  Enterprise\nInformation Project has established a regional network for providing ICT services. These are\nlocated in already existing business development centers, and there is close collaboration with\nregional chambers of commerce and industry.\n54. Relatedly, assistance from the United States of America has focused on policy and\nregulatory reforms in financial markets and trade and investment systems. A recent initiative by\nthe United States of America Agency for International Development (USAID) is focusing on\nimproving competitiveness in identified subsectors with a view to improving the vertical and\nhorizontal  linkages  between  firms  within  these  subsectors.  This  initiative  focuses  on\nmicroeconomic reforms aimed at promoting the \u201ccompetitiveness diamond\u201d as propounded by\nthe Harvard Business School. Close consultations with the above major external aid agencies\nwere conducted during program preparation and the proposed program has strong support from\nall those agencies.  Industrial \u201cincubators\u201d and an exchange for subcontracting by SMEs is\nbeing promoted by the United Nations Industrial Development Organization.\nF. ADB\u2019s Strategy and Operations in the Sector\n55. ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program Update reiterates and highlights private sector\ndevelopment as one of the key areas for ADB support through the promotion of policy and\ninstitutional reforms to help Sri Lanka reduce poverty and achieve sustainable growth. Private\nsector development, especially SME development, will play a direct role in supporting poverty\nreduction by creating of productive employment for the poor.\n56. Earlier ADB efforts in supporting SME development focused on provision of low-cost\ncredit to finance private sector investment, combined with building the capacity of DFIs. The\nstress on loan disbursements led to choosing as many financial institutions as possible for\nonlending, including the highly inefficient public sector banks and NGOs, at the cost of building\nsustainability. Capacity building was most successful within the DFIs. Gains were recorded with\nprivate  banks  but  substantial  scope  remains  for  improvement.  The  projects  have  usually\nanticipated very large gains in terms of initial employment expansion without taking into account\nthe very high mortality rates among SMEs. However, unlike DFI lending elsewhere, in Sri Lanka\nboth ADB and World Bank loans are generally regarded as having contributed positively to the\neconomy by providing access to finance at a time of critical shortages. In a sharp departure\nfrom worldwide experience with DFI lending, the most recent projects have been well managed,\nwith very high rates of loan repayment.\n57. ADB has also provided two PCGs to Sri Lanka for the Small and Medium Enterprise\nAssistance  Project  (SMAP)6  and  the  Credit  Enhancement  Facility  for  Private  Enterprises.7\nThese initiatives were meant to help the country gain access to the international financial\nmarkets and catalyze private capital inflows during difficult market conditions to support private\nsector development and assist in reducing poverty in the rural and semirural areas of the\ncountry.\n                                                          \n6\nLoan 1522-SRI: Second Small and Medium Enterprise Assistance Project, for $5 million, approved on June 1997.\n7\nLoan 1629-SRI: Credit Enhancement Facility for Private Enterprises, for $5 million, approved on September 1998.", "Strategic Framework for SME Support\n2001-2007\nSMESDP Mid-term Long-term\nStrengthening Markets and Improved Public Sector Legal and Financial\nCapacities Governance Framework for non-bank\nfinance\nPublic Sector Autonomous tax\nadministration\n- Strategic oversight: SME Task Force\nImplementation of\n- Policy Attention: SME Policy Unit framework for secured\n- Regulatory Reform: Deregulation Simplified tax system transactions\nCommittee\nBanks\nSecuritized lending for\nCustoms reform\n- Credit SMEs\n- Investments in HRD\n- Investments in ICT\n- Lending methods forSMEs IDBdownsizedand Strengthened legal\nrestructured framework for\n- Corporate Governance\nfinanciadl sector\nStimulation of BDS for\nSMEs\n1\n4\nInitiation of secured\ntransactions legal reform\nagenda\nSelected provision of\npartial credit guarantee to\nbanks\nDeregulation Committee\n(cid:1)\nRegulatory Simplification through\nannual Deregulation White Paper\nCommittee for Legal Reform of\nFinancial Sector\n(cid:1)\nAgenda for secured transactions\n(cid:1)\nLevel playing field for banks/ DFIs\n(cid:1)\nSimplified legal framework\nBDS = business development services; DFI = development finance institution; HRD = Human Resource Development; ICT = information and communication technology;\nIDB = Industrial Development Board; SME = Small and Medium Enterprise.", "15\n58. ADB,  in  coordination  with  other  external  agencies  (e.g.,  IMF  and  World  Bank),  is\nfocusing its operations on a combination of macroeconomic and financial sector reforms to\nreduce  the  crowding  out  of  the  private  sector.  Through  the  Private  Sector  Development\nProgram,8 ADB is supporting (i) financial sector development by eliminating distortions in the\nmarket arising from regulatory barriers and special privileges accorded to state-owned financial\ninstitutions; (ii) further privatization and restructuring of state-owned enterprises; (iii) addressing\nlabor market rigidities to accelerate private sector investments and raise industrial productivity,\nand mitigating the social impact of such reforms; and (iv) promoting competition, and entry and\nexit,  and sector policies that improve the efficiency of resource allocation. In the short to\nmedium term, ADB will continue its assistance to facilitate financial sector development by  (i)\npromoting good governance over the financial markets by improving the understanding of key\ngovernance  principles  and  best  practices,  building  capacity  for  good  governance,  and\ninstitutionalizing of good governance principles through organizational restructuring; and (ii)\nmobilizing financial resources from commercial sources with support of ADB\u2019s guarantee facility\nfor relending to the private sector through domestic financial institutions. The proposed Project\nis fully in line with ADB\u2019s operations and sector strategy in Sri Lanka.\nIV. THE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM\nA.  Rationale\n59. If Sri Lanka is to achieve its growth rate of 7-8 percent per annum in Vision 2010, it must\ndiversify its economy and improve its competitiveness. To do so will require renewed reforms to\nsimplify  the  regulatory  and  incentive  structure.  A  key  focus  will  be  strengthening  the\nperformance  of  the  SME  sector  to  enable  it  to  better  respond  to  the  challenges  of  an\nincreasingly  globalized  economy.  This  will  serve  to  improve  competitiveness,  expand\nemployment, and promote diversification at a critical juncture in the nation\u2019s economy.\n60. The importance of diversification is underscored by the economy\u2019s reliance on a few\nsectors for its exports\u2014principally garment and jewelry\u2014and by its increasing integration into\nand exposure to global markets. The need to support SMEs is made more urgent by the decline\nin the contribution of formal sector SMEs to output and employment. This is a matter of policy\nconcern as dynamic economies are not sustainably led by the expansion of large firms alone.\nSustainable, equitable growth requires an incentive and regulatory structure that provides a\nlevel playing field that enables SMEs to grow into larger businesses.\n61. To play the role envisaged for them, SMEs will have to overcome a wide array of\nconstraints.  Improving  the  business  environment  through  regulatory  simplification  and\nstrengthening public governance is essential to address external constraints. This will be greatly\nassisted by the presence of institutions that promote improved dialogue within the private\nsector, and improved relations between the private sector and the government.\n62. Lack of management and other skills, and limited access to information and technology\nare  critical  impediments  at  the  level  of  the  individual  SME.  Capacity  building  through  the\ndevelopment of a vibrant market for business services that can provide a diversified range of\nconsulting and other services to SMEs is essential to address this impediment, as are efforts to\nstimulate awareness of the value of these services. By strengthening SME capabilities, BDS\n                                                          \n8\n  Loan 1800(SF)-SRI: Private Sector Development Program, for $85 million, approved on 12 December 2000,` and\nLoan 1801-SRI: Private Sector Development Program, for $15 million, approved on 12 December 2000.", "16\nalso serves to make SMEs better business risks for banks and thus improves their access to\nfinance.\n63. Access to finance on commercial terms is vital to catalyze investments by SMEs. DFIs\nalone cannot serve the market adequately, while commercial banks continue to have problems\nin raising term funds for this purpose.  Greater competition among banks and DFIs, and wider\nuse of instruments needed to gain access to capital markets, will improve financing for SMEs.\nThe considerable investment of banks in IT is helping them to better manage the risks of lending\nto the SME market, a process that will be strengthened by building capacity in the appropriate\ncredit evaluation and counseling skills.  Parallel efforts are needed to promote non-bank finance\nthough the development of the appropriate legal framework for secured transactions.\n64. Use of  IT can help SMEs gain better access to information, markets, business partners\nand skills and learning opportunities. Experience elsewhere has shown that increased use of IT\ncan result in SMEs being better able to develop new markets and compete effectively in both\ndomestic and international environments.  Finding and motivating the right kind of private sector\npartners to develop low cost and sustainable solutions for SMEs is a key ingredient of success\nin this sector.\nB. Objectives and Scope\n65. The goal is to facilitate a more competitive and diversified economy that relies on a\ndynamic business sector that can respond freely to market signals. This is to be achieved\nthrough  reforms  that  will  reduce  regulatory  impediments,  lower  transaction  costs,  improve\naccess to credit, and enhance capacities in private sector firms and financial institutions.\n66. The  objectives  are  to  create  a  dynamic  SME  sector,  enhance  its  capabilities  and\ncompetitiveness,  create  jobs  and,  in  doing  so,  reduce  poverty.  The  objectives  are  to  be\nachieved  through  an  integrated  approach  that  (i)  strengthens  the  enabling  business\nenvironment for SMEs, (ii) catalyzes investment by improving SMEs access to finance through\ncommercial channels, and (iii) enhances the capacity of the Sri Lankan BDS sector to efficiently\nand effectively deliver services to SMEs.\n67. These activities will lead to the expansion of existing SMEs, aid the transition of informal\nSMEs into the formal economy, and encourage the establishment of new SMEs.\n68. The program comprises (i) program of policy reform to improve the policy and enabling\nenvironment; (ii) a project to strengthen SME capacities through the development of the market\nfor the provision of BDS; (iii) lines of credit to CBC, Sampath Bank, DFCC, NDB, and HNB,\nlinked to their strengthened capacity to provide credit to SMEs on a sustainable basis on\ncommercial terms; and (iv) ADB\u2019s PCG of commercial cofinancing for each participating bank\nfor its term lending to SMEs.\n69. The project will be supported by three key initiatives:\n(i)  Articulation of a vision or strategy for SME development while setting in place a\ndurable  mechanism  to  support  the  policy/regulatory  environment  through  the\ncompletion of a SME policy white paper by a SME task force.\n(ii)  Establishment of an SME policy unit  to address future SME-related policy and\nregulatory issues", "17\n(iii)  An  institutional  response\u2014the  Deregulation  Committee\u2014for  identifying  and\nimplementing a set of phased policy and institutional reforms to strengthen the\nenabling  environment,  reduce  the  transacting  costs  of  business,  simplify  the\nregulatory framework, and remove policy and institutional biases.  While these\nefforts will benefit all firms, international experience shows that they will have a\nproportionately greater positive impact on SMEs.\nC. Policy Framework and Actions\n70. The key time-bound policies and actions are described in the development policy letter\n(Appendix 1) and the policy matrix  (Appendix 2). The detailed reforms and project components\nare described in the following paras.\n1.  A Strategy for SME Development\n71. The Program will support a shift to a greater focus on the policy environment for SME\ndevelopment. Primarily due to budget constraints, but also because of the nature of BDS, direct\ndelivery of BDS by the public sector will reach only a small percentage of the SME population.\nThe public sector\u2019s efforts will therefore concentrate on getting the enabling environment right,\nto widen its impact on the SME sector without excessive costs. However, a key impediment to a\ncoherent and clear strategy for SME development is the lack of a public-private process and\ndialogue  to  identify  and  address  issues  and  constraints  as  they  arise.  The  Program  will\ntherefore encourage the use of public-private dialogue, in addition to promoting the use of such\na mechanism at the core of the policy component.\n72. Recent developments have underscored the importance of greater coordination in SME\npolicies.  The establishment of incubators and sub-contracting exchange schemes under the\nauspices of MTI, and the ministry\u2019s absorption of the focus on rural and micro- and small scale\nindustries provided by the now-defunct Ministry of Rural and Industrial Development are some\nof these developments. Others include the recognition of the need to capitalize on assistance\nbeing provided by USAID to strengthen competitiveness in industrial SME clusters, and to\nrationalize and restructure the IDB over the medium-to-long term. These developments have led\nto the consensus for action to develop a coherent policy direction for the government that\naddresses issues of stakeholder concern, is bipartisan and fiscally sustainable.\n73. The priority is to establish an effective framework for immediate stock taking and a\nmechanism  for  providing  ongoing  SME  monitoring  and  long-term  policy  and  regulatory\nmanagement. This is to be initiated through a SME white paper to be prepared by the Task\nForce on SME development. The white paper will set out for the SME sector a vision and\nstrategy  over  the  medium  term  based  on  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  experience  and  international  best\npractices.  It  will  identify  policy  and  institutional  reforms  needed  to  realize  the  vision,  and\nestablish a clear and specific plan of action\u2014identifying responsible parties, milestones, and\nbenchmarks.\n74. The Task Force was established in October 2001 and consists of 15 leading policy\nanalysts,  academics,  business  figures,  representatives  of  SME  institutions,  chambers  of\ncommerce, Deregulation Committee, and the banking industry.  Working Groups and TORs\nhave been established and the Task Force expects to hold public hearings in Colombo, Kandy\nand Matara over the next 6 months in developing the draft white paper.", "18\n75. The Task Force\u2019s responsibilities follow:\n(i)  publicize its activities to build awareness and encourage participation;\n(ii)  analyze the contribution of SMEs to the Sri Lanka economy;\n(iii)  list the objectives and fundamental principles that underpin the national strategy;\n(iv)  articulate the elements necessary for achieving a national vision/strategy;\n(v)  outline the institutional reforms necessary to achieve the national strategy for SME\ndevelopment;\n(vi)  during the life of the task force, acting as a sounding board to resolve SME policy\nissues; and\n(vii)  publicize an action plan that identifies short and long term goals.\n2.  SME Policy Unit\n76. Government policy formulation and institutional reform for SMEs will focus on lessons\nlearned from international and local experience. A wealth of existing knowledge relates to\ncreating an enabling environment and there is general agreement among stakeholders in the\nSME sector as to what constitutes a good enabling environment. Such lessons need to be\ntempered and modified to relate to the specifics of Sri Lanka\u2019s economy. Furthermore, such\nlessons can only be implemented through an ongoing consultative process that includes all\nstakeholders and is based on the availability of appropriate information.\n77. The policy unit will be formed in the MTI; it will consist of a small group tasked with\ncoordinating and managing the preparation of policy analysis. The unit will respond to the needs\nof the SME task force and the MTI in preparing its outputs. It will be supported by a TA grant to\nset  up  its  operations  (equipment  and  furnishings).  One  of  its  most  important  activities,\nconducting the baseline survey, will be financed from a mix of grant and project loan assistance.\nThe Unit will have a lean staff and will outsource portions of its work, in the process contributing\nto the development of BDS providers.\n78. The tasks of the SME policy unit will be to:\n(i)  stay abreast of best practices;\n(ii)  provide analytical underpinning to proposed SME policy and regulatory changes;\n(iii)  advise on the size bias of proposed policies or regulations;\n(iv)  monitor the state of SME growth and, by extension, the effectiveness of BDS\nproviders;\n(v)  draw lessons from past actions and apply such lessons going forward;\n(vi)  provide  a  forum  for  an  ongoing  dialogue  between  the  Government  and  SME\nsector, and", "19\n(vii)  carry out a base line survey on the sector annually.\n3.   The Deregulation Committee\n79. To support its objective of improving the investor climate for both foreign and domestic\ninvestment, through the removal of roadblocks to investment, the Government has established\na Deregulation Committee reporting to MTI. The Committee is primarily composed of the private\nsector. It will undertake studies and hold hearings to evaluate impediments posed for business\nby procedural, regulatory, policy, and institutional and other constraints. As conditions for the\nrelease of the first tranche, the committee produced reports on the framework for evaluating\ntransaction costs and the burden imposed on businesses  by the regulatory framework, and a\nclear framework and analysis of the regulatory impediments created by the tax administration.\nThese studies, combined with the committee\u2019s mission statement and terms of reference, are\nimportant components of the analytical toolkit to be used over the program period to prepare a\nseries of deregulation studies, which will be published in an annual deregulation white paper. To\npromote transparency of the process, the Government will annually announce  the Committee\u2019s\nrecommendations that have been implemented, and give reasons for not implementing others.\n80. Over the mediumterm, the committee will undertake activities to (i) develop investor road\nmaps of impediments to investments in particular sectors, (ii) develop general criteria and\nguidelines for evaluating the costs and benefits of regulations, and (iii) institute reviews of\nregulations  for  specific  sectors  based  on  the  criteria  and  methodology  developed.  The\ncommittee will be supported by TA granted under the Project (Appendix 6).\n4.  Rationalizing the Incentive Framework\n81. Reflecting ongoing policy dialogue conducted jointly with ADB and IMF, the Government\nis preparing a strategy paper for medium- and long-term reforms covering all aspects of tax\npolicy and tax administration including (i) phasing out of turnover taxes and their replacement by\nGST, (ii) phasing out of exemptions from GST, (iii) unifying surcharges and stamp duties on\nimports with the import duty, (iv) reducing the corporate tax, and (v) rationalizing  tax incentives\nfor investment. These reforms are to be implemented in a manner that seeks to achieve long-\nterm revenue neutrality but will require short-term assistance to meet adjustment costs.\n82. Under  the  SMESDP,  the  key  objectives  will  be  to  (i)  begin  with  the  process  of\nrationalizing and subsequently eliminating archaic and inefficient taxes that raise transactions\ncosts  for  business\u2014principally  through  stamp  duties  and  the  turnover  tax  on  the  banking\nsystem, (ii) reduce the bias for investments by large firms by moving toward a lower single flat\nrate of corporate tax, and (iii) achieve greater transparency in the incentive structure\u2014and\nimproved allocation of resources. The following actions will be completed prior to the release of\nthe first tranche:\n(i)  elimination of the turnover tax on banking, and  reduction by 1 percentage point of\nthe National Security Levy,\n(ii)   reduction of the stamp duty on imports, from 2 percent to 1 percent, and\n(iii)  elimination of the Save- the- Nation Contribution.\n83. For release of the second tranche, a tax reform strategy with specific targets over the\nmediumterm will be announced by March 2002. The strategy will include eliminating of stamp", "20\nduties on imports, and harmonizing of tax incentives in the Inland Revenue Act. In addition, the\ncorporate tax rate will be reduced from its current level of 35 percent, to an amount to be\ndetermined in the light of revenue expectations and as agreed upon with ADB and IMF.\n84. The preceding measures provide the essential preparation for deep-seated reforms to\nmodernize the tax system and, subsequently, customs. They are necessary to ensure that the\ngains from policy reforms are not undermined by institutional rigidities and impediments to the\nfree flow of goods, services, and investments. A key focus of the Government\u2019s future reform\nagenda, therefore, is a comprehensive reform of the tax system involving major improvements\nto governance and autonomy. These efforts complement the deregulation targets under the\nSMESDP. Consequently, ADB and IMF are expected to jointly maintain a policy dialogue for\nfurther development of the tax policy agenda. In addition to simplifying of the tax system, these\nefforts  are  expected  to  lead  to  the  phased  development  of  a  modern,  integrated,  and\nautonomous authority for inland revenue and customs. That is to be achieved through (i)\nmeasures to strengthen administrative procedures; (ii) improvement of the legal framework; (iii)\nstrengthening of organization, personnel policies, and management practices; (iv) strengthening\nof skills through training; (v) phasing in of an IT system to support the new integrated authority;\nand (vi) provision of a voluntary retirement scheme.\n5. Restructuring the Industrial Development Board\n85. IDB is in the process of changing its strategy from a service provider to facilitator of BDS\nand a one-stop shop for information for SMEs. Over the medium term, IDB expects to acquire\nan increased budget responsibility so that it could becoming less dependent on the government\nbudget, increase the participation of the private sector on its board, and identify those of its\nassets and divisions that are central to its core strategy. In this connection, IDB will also identify\na number of functions and services it intends to offer its clientele in the future, consistent with its\nnew vision. IDB is expected to enter into a performance contract with the MTI that includes\nincentive and penalty clauses related to its performance.\n86. IDB is expected to withdraw from competing in sectors where private sector agents can\nbetter provide  services. These include but will not be limited to (i) purchase and distribution of\nraw materials, (ii) introduction of new designs and new technology, (iii) quality control, (iv)\ntraining of workers, and (v) marketing and sales promotion. It is expected that IDB\u2019s eventual\nrestructuring would be timed with a follow-up project for further deregulation and support to the\nSME sector sometime in 2004.\n6. Improving Access to IT\n87. The  Government  is  developing  an  integrated  strategy  to  address  the  numerous\nconstraints to wider use of the Internet by SMEs including the cost of computers, low density of\nphone lines, and the cost of tariffs and limited competition in the telecoms and related sectors. A\ntask force has been established to address the chief constraints. Progress is being made on a\nnumber of fronts, including development of the enabling environment. The computer crimes act,\nthe e-transactions act, and the data protection act are important pieces of legislation being\ndrafted  under  this  effort.  Under  the  SMESDP,  a  Cabinet  sub-committee  was    formed  in\nSeptember 2001, chaired by the Minister of Posts and Telecommunications, to develop an\naction plan to introduce greater competition in the provision of telephony services.  In this\nconnection, prior to release of the second tranche,   the  Government will  issue one or more\nlicenses  to eliminate SLTs monopoly of the independent gateway.", "21\n88. As the near-term teledensity within Sri Lanka is low, there will be a continuing restraint\non  utilizing  the  Internet  for  economic  development  through  such  tools  as  e-commerce,  e-\nbusiness, e-government, e-learning, etc.9 In the development of any e-commerce initiatives, the\nfocus will need to be on broad-based external access and use of the Internet rather than\ninternal, in-country access. The rest of the world will be accessing Sri Lankan information and\npurchasing Sri Lankan goods and services via the Internet long before Sri Lankans are doing\nthis directly themselves. Any e-commerce solution must therefore look outward and be aimed at\nexport-oriented SMEs. There is also a need to assist (i) SMEs and policy makers in availing of\nIT  to  improve  access  to  information  services  and  (ii)  assist  SMEs  and  SME  clusters  in\nstrengthening linkages to the wider economy.\n89. The Project will provide TA support in the form of seed capital for promising options\nincluding the following:\n(i)  improving  SME  access  to  global  markets  by  modifying  an  existing  portal  in\ncollaboration with existing institutions in Sri Lanka and internationally\u2014a number\nof such portals exist, and assistance will be provided to establish a partnership\nbetween a local and an international provider. The objective is to ensure that the\nresulting portal has a commercial focus, is able to present SME storefronts to\nboth  consumers  and  businesses,  and  provides  the  means  to  complete\ntransactions;\n(ii)   extending the reach of effective business development and business information\nservices nationally through the use of web-based solutions. In this connection,\nthe project will seek to establish synergy between a leading provider of business\ninformation services with a NGO (Sarvodyha) that is establishing a network of\ntelecenters, with a view to achieving  union between outreach and financial\nsustainability;\n(iii)  creating a more transparent business environment through support for MTI  and\nthe SME Policy Unit to assist SMEs meet simplified regulatory requirements,\nestablish information directories, etc. (Appendix 6).\n7.  Improving Access to Finance\na.  Equal Opportunities In the Banking Sector\n90. With declining access to low-cost loans from multilateral sources, it will be essential for\nthe DFIs to raise resources from other sources if they are to compete with other banks. To\nprovide a level playing field, the Government will review the Banking Act and Monetary Law with\na  view  to  effecting  amendments  that  remove  impediments  to  the  DFIs  in  offering  current\naccounts or establishing foreign currency units currently permitted to the private banks. Parallel\nto this,  the Government will take steps to bring the private commercial banks into the fold of its\npublic guarantees, which is essential to gaining access to international capital markets, for\nexample. In this connection, it is expected that careful consideration will be given to basing the\nprovision of a public guarantee on carefully circumscribed public interest grounds to reduce the\nlikelihood of a moral hazard. Such guarantees will always be partial; for un-guaranteed portions\nof loans best practice \u2013 as in the Small Business Administration of the United States of America\n                                                          \n9\nThis is being addressed in part by aid agency and Government efforts to support multipurpose telecenters and\ncommunity telecenters.", "22\n\u2013 involves fostering securitization. Such securitization is ultimately dependent on a modern\nsecured transactions regime available in the United States, but not in Sri Lanka.\nb. Access to Secured Credit by SMEs\n91. SMESDP will seek to ensure that a more cost efficient and diversified secured credit\nsupply is available to SMEs so that competitive pressures are brought to bear on DFIs and\ncommercial banks extending credit to SMEs. SMESDP will support a reform of Sri Lanka\u2019s\nsecured  transactions  regime,  encompassing  creation,  registration,  and  creditor-initiated\nenforcement of security interests in movable property. Such a legal framework will enable SME\ndebtors to effectively use movable property as collateral for credit. The legal framework will also\ngive appropriate consideration to important policy questions such as exceptions for certain\ndebtor property that represents basic livelihood (like workmen\u2019s tools), consumer protection, and\nappropriate debtor protection on the sale and repossession of debtor assets under creditor\nadministered enforcement. A detailed reform agenda will be developed with assistance from TA.\nThe implementation of this agenda is expected to take place with possible further ADB support\nin a subsequent project in 2004.\n92. Legal reforms under SMESDP will be guided by a working group or committee for Legal\nReform of the Financial Sector established in November 2001, under the chairmanship of the\nChief Justice. The working group will also initiate a fundamental review with a view to identifying\nkey legal reforms and amendments required to support a modern financial sector and open\neconomy.  Members of the working group include representatives from the Legal Draftsman\u2019s\nDepartment, MOFP, BOI, Attorney-General\u2019s Office, Securities and Exchange Commission,\nCentral Bank of Sri Lanka, the private sector, and the Public Enterprise Reform Commission.\nc. Other Measures\n93. A key objective in responding to the need for medium- and long-term funds for onlending\nis  the  development  of  a  strong,  liquid,  and  fully  transparent  debt  instrument  market.  The\nGovernment intends to pursue this objective in the medium term by issuing long-term treasury\nbonds to provide market indicators, by continuing to stimulate the secondary market, and by\nprotecting the public interest through sound monitoring and regulation of financial institutions.\nThe Government is also taking measures to reduce its large fiscal deficit resulting primarily from\nthe high world prices of oil and security-related expenditures, in line with the agreements under\na standby arrangement with the IMF. A reduction in the demand for credit by the Government\nand reduced crowding out of the private sector are expected to result and will have major\nimpacts on improving funding for private sector activity.\nD.        Capacity Building\n94. The principal need for capacity building is in respect of  the consulting firms and financial\ninstitutions that support SMEs. Experience has shown that the greatest benefits are derived\nfrom a wholesale approach to capacity building rather than from a direct provision of training\nand technical assistance.  This is reflected in the design of SMESDP, which is explicitly targeted\nat strengthening the BDS sector through measures that include improving access to global best\npractice and development of curriculum for appropriate training and capacity building programs\n(e.g. for technology institutes, training of bank staff in SME lending techniques, etc.).  An\ninvestment loan is provided for this purpose.", "23\n95. However, so long as low income levels and poor enabling environments continue to\nconstrain SME capacities,  direct interventions in capacity building in SMEs will also be needed\nin mitigation. For this reason, to complement the wholesale approach, (i) a voucher scheme will\nbe supported to assist SMEs to access low-cost capacity building services and (ii) TA grant\nassistance  will  promote  the  use  of  new  technologies  such  as  IT  to  assist  SMEs  access\ninformation, markets, technology and learning opportunities.\n96. Significant capacity building assistance is needed by the Government in terms of  (i)\ndeveloping  a  medium  term  strategic  overview  for  the  SME  sector  (ii)  providing  short-term\nmonitoring and policy making assessments, and (iii) for medium-term policy and regulatory\nmanagement through the Deregulation Committee.  Assistance for this purpose will be provided\nthrough TA.\nE. The Project Components\n1. The Business Services Support Facility\n97. Reflecting  discussions  in  paras.  27-30,  the  SME  project  will  establish  a  Business\nServices Support Facility (BSSF), which will seek to uplift skills and broker services between\nproviders and SMEs. A key objective will be to help service providers offer diversified consulting\nand training services to SMEs. A related objective  will be to improve recognition that lending to\nSMEs, though risky, is commercially viable if done well, with the right products and lending\nmodalities.\n98.   Activities  will  include  uplifting  local  BDS  capacity;  strengthening  local  facilitative\norganizations, e.g., associations and chambers of commerce; promoting the creation of new\nBDS products; enhancing the use of IT to promote growth; training of trainers, etc. Rather than\nproviding services directly to SMEs, the BSSF will facilitate the BDS that the SME market is\nseeking by enhancing the capacity of the BDS providers to respond and by building awareness\nof the availability of BDS providers among natural facilitators (e.g., associations) and the SME\nmarket.\n99. The BSSF life span will be limited to that of the Program. The facility will (i) coordinate\nnetworking among the BDS market, both supply- and demand-side; (ii) build awareness of BDS\nto  stimulate  its  use;  and  (iii)  build  the  capacity  of  BDS  providers  and  SME  groups  (e.g.,\nassociations). This will be done through subcontracts with service providers in targeted markets.\n100. To help carry out its functions, the BSSF will have a fund of $2.4 million available on a\ncompetitive and cofinancing basis to BDS providers and facilitators. Among other purposes, the\nfund will be used to finance a voucher scheme for SMEs to build their interest in BDS and a\nmatching grants scheme for BDS providers. The fund will be open to contribution from other\nfunding  agencies  and will be used to stimulate the market. The Management of the BSSF will\nalso use the fund to draw out BDS providers and facilitators that target (i) capacity building in\ncommercial banks under the Project seeking to lend to the SME sector and  (ii) develop IT\ntraining  for  SMEs  through  appropriate  training  institutes.    Appendix  7  gives  the  terms  of\nreference and cost estimates. The facility staff will be limited to three professionals (two Sri\nLankans and an expatriate with BDS experience), and an office manager.", "24\n2.  The  Credit Assistance\n101. In  the  highly  competitive  banking  system,  a  number  of  commercial  banks  are\nincreasingly  willing  to  invest  in  the  human  resources  and  technology  required  to  lend\nsuccessfully to the SME sector. These banks are unwilling to incur the additional costs and\nconflict of interest posed by the use of an apex mechanism involving another commercial bank.\nThe lines of credit will therefore be coursed through individual banks and will be available for\nstart-up, long-term,  and medium-term financing needs of SMEs. The loans will be available to a\nbroad range of sectors.\n102. PCIs  will  be  drawn  from  commercial  banks  and  DFIs  demonstrating  an  upfront\ncommitment and capacity to effectively serve the SME market. PCIs must meet operational and\nfinancial eligibility requirements, including adherence to high corporate governance standards,\nto  access  funds.  They  must  also  have  in  place  integrated  computer  and  IT  systems  for\nmanagement, treasury and operations functions, knowledge of or commitment to acquiring\nappropriate  lending  technologies,  and    adoption  of  loan  classification  structures  and  other\npractices that allow adequate monitoring of loans made. At the minimum, PCIs will need to have\nGlobus-style IT systems and a loan classification system that allows monitoring of loans by size\nand purpose (details are provided in paras 132 - 133).\n103. In line with these requirements, PCIs have invested heavily in technology. They have\nintroduced, or are in the process of introducing, integrated bankwide computer systems. These\nsystems provide full and flexible loan and deposit management facilities, and accounting and\ntreasury functions. By September 2001, CBC, HNB, and Sampath Bank will all have in place the\nsystems needed to track and manage large numbers of SME loans. In terms of loan tracking,\nthe only element missing is a clear definition of loan purpose. Government banks trail the\ncommercial sector in introducing of computer systems, but are catching up.  NDB is introducing\nthe Globus banking system and the system will be fully implemented by March 2002. DFCC\nplans to introduce a new computer system, but these plans have been delayed due to the\nmerger with CBC in October 2001. Once the merger is complete, CBC will roll out its own\ncomputer system to DFCC\u2019s eight branches.\n104. SMESDP will also assist PCIs gain greater recognition that their ICT systems can help\nthem to better monitor their SME clients\u2019 business and, as a result, position them to offer SMEs\na range of services from web-based presentation of storefronts, assistance in strengthening\naccounts, payroll, etc. to closing commercial transactions with buyers of the goods and services\nthat the SMEs produce.  These activities will improve PCIs understanding of SME risks.\n105. In terms of electronic (e)-readiness, by the end of 2001, the banking system of Sri Lanka\nwill  have  the  infrastructure  in  place  to  effectively  support  local  and  foreign  e-commerce\ntransactions.  CBC  was  the  first  bank  in  Sri  Lanka  to  offer  on-line  services  to  corporate\ncustomers in 1997 and has now expanded this facility to provide access via the Internet to\ncustomers in all its 82 branches. HNB is planning to establish an Internet Mall by August 2002\nthat will allow SMEs to advertise their products and services and collect payment over the\nInternet. HNB is thus mirroring the approach taken by Plantersbank E*Com in the Philippines.\nHNB also plans to establish electronic banking centers for villages, located on the premises of\ngeneral stores, and be linked to the branch network by means of microwave or satellite links.\nThe remaining element to this package is systematic use of credit scoring techniques. NDB has\ndeveloped an inhouse system which it uses on a limited basis. However, each of the PCIs,\nincluding NDB, is moving in this direction \u2013 something which their IT systems are well geared to\nsupport.", "25\n106. If needed, TA to PCIs \u2013 or assistance to establish links with leaders in the field such as\nPlanters  Bank  -  will  be  provided  through  the  BSSF.  BSSF  will  organize  the  provision  of\nappropriately structured training and capacity building exercises to be provided by private sector\nservice providers on a fee basis. The PCIs will enter into understanding with the BSSF for this\npurpose. The BSSF will, in consultation with the Government and the participating banks, also\nprovide  assistance  in  upgrading  the  capacity  of  the  local  banking  institutes  in  terms  of\ncurriculum, training of trainers, etc.\n107. PCIs will enter into a contract with the Government under which they will submit annual\naudited statements of their operations over five years, displaying profitability, capital adequacy,\nrate of default and provisioning. In addition, each PCI will satisfy ADB regarding its SME lending\nhistory and capacity, as well as its ability to report loan statistics to the project management unit\n(PMU).\n108. Each PCI will be given training in ADB disbursement methods and in record keeping\nprocedures.\n109. The BSSF will conduct on, an as-needed basis, impact assessments on a subset of the\nloan recipients to look for impact data, including employment, increased sales, new markets,\nnew technologies, reduced expenses, etc.\n3.  Credit Enhancement\n110. To supplement ADB-financed resources, and with a view to promoting both institutional\nand market development, credit enhancement will be provided in the form of an ADB PCG (the\nADB guarantee) to each participating bank to allow commercial cofinancing of an aggregate of\nup to $90 million. The ADB guarantee will enhance the credit of the participating banks and\nenable them to access funding on better terms than would otherwise be possible, thereby\nreducing their dependence on multilateral sources for such funding. The ADB guarantee will\nrequire the repayment of principal to commercial cofinanciers. The ADB guarantee will be\ncounter-guaranteed  by  the  Government,  which  will  also  guarantee  interest  payments  to\ncommercial cofinanciers. Processing of the commercial cofinancing and the ADB guarantee will\nbe initiated  (i) when 50 percent of the lines of credit have been disbursed, and (ii) when legal\namendments or modifications have been completed, enabling the Government to provide the\nrelevant  guarantee  and  counterguarantees  of  the  commercial  cofinancing.  Commercial\ncofinanciers  will  be  selected  competitively  in  accordance  with  standard  ADB  policies  and\nprocedures.\nF. Social and Environmental Measures\n111. The project is not expected to generate adverse social impacts requiring corresponding\nmitigating measures. To promote gender equality and poverty reduction special consideration\nwill be given under both investment loans to women entrepreneurs and regions with high levels\nof  poverty.    To  ensure  effective  monitoring  and  assessment  of  socioeconomic  impacts,  a\ncomprehensive  set  of  socioeconomic  indicators  of  entrepreneurs  and  employees  will  be\ncollected by the PCIs in a computerized format as part of their loan monitoring requirements.\nThe project\u2019s environmental category is B, requiring PCIs to have appropriate safeguards in\nplace  as  regards  to  subloan  selection  to  ensure  that  adverse  environmental  impacts  are\navoided.  The PCIs and the EAs have been found to have adequate capacity for this purpose.", "26\nV. THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE\n112. It is proposed that ADB provide a policy loan, two investment loans and a partial credit\nguarantee support:\nA. The Policy Loan\n \n1. Amount, Terms, and Sources of Funds\n113. The policy loan of $20 million equivalent will be provided from ADB\u2019s Special Funds\nresources and  will (ii) have a repayment period of 24 years, including a grace period of 8 years;\nand (iii) carry an interest rate of 1.0 percent during the grace period and 1.5 percent thereafter.\nThe loan will support a program of reforms and will be released in two tranches that will use\ncounterpart funds. The following is a preliminary estimate of the costs of adjustment:\n(i)  administrative  costs  of  institutional  changes  including  establishment  and\noperation of the SME task force, the SME policy unit and the annual baseline\nsurveys; the operational costs of the Deregulation Committee (estimated at about\n$2 million); and\n(ii)  loss in revenues from tax and tariff reform: elimination of the turnover tax on\nbanking  ($16  million)  and  stamp  duty  on  imports  ($45  million);  reduction  in\nNational  Security  Levy  ($20  million).  The  loss  in  revenues  of  about  $90  is\nexpected to be mitigated by end-2002 by an increase in the GST tax and other\nmeasures, including improvement in collection of tax arrears and expansion of\nregistration, which are to be determined and implemented in consultation with the\nADB and IMF. Overall, during 2002\u20132006, it is expected that tax reforms will\nachieve revenue neutrality.\n2. Procurement and Disbursement\n114. The proceeds of the policy loan will be utilized to finance the full foreign exchange costs\n(excluding the local duties and taxes) of imports produced in and procured from ADB\u2019s member\ncountries, other than those specified in the list of ineligible item (Appendix 8) and imports\nfinanced by other bilateral and multilateral sources. All procurement will be through normal\ncommercial practices in case of procurement by the private sector, or prescribed procedures\nacceptable to ADB in the case of procurement by the public sector, having due regard for the\nprinciples of economy and efficiency. The Borrower will certify that the volume of eligible imports\nexceeds the amount of ADB\u2019s projected disbursements under the policy loan in a given period.\nADB will have the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the\nBorrower\u2019s certification.\n3. Counterpart Funds\n115. The policy framework for the SMESDP includes specific components that bear distinct\ncosts of structural adjustments. The counterpart funds to be generated from the loan proceeds\nwill be used to finance the structural adjustment costs under the SMESDP. In particular, the\nGovernment will ensure that in social expenditures on health and education will be maintained\nat current levels during the Program period.", "27\n4. Tranching  and Monitoring\n \na. Tranching\n \n(i) Tranche 1 - $10 million\n116. The first tranche of $10 million will be released upon fulfillment of the following actions\nprior to Board consideration in December 2001. All conditions have been completed:\n(i)  notification of the establishment of a task force for SMEs;\n(ii)  establishment of a deregulation committee and submission  of a deregulation\nstudy on transactions costs and tax administration;\n(iii)  elimination of the turnover tax on financial institutions and the Save-the-Nation\nContribution;\n(iv)  reduction in stamp duties on imports from 2 percent to 1 percent, and reduction\nin national security levy by 1 percentage point;\n(v)  establishment of a Cabinet Subcommittee, chaired by the Minister of Posts and\nTelecommunications,  to  develop  an  action  plan  for  introducing  greater\ncompetition in the provision of telephony services through the award of additional\nlicense(s) to eliminate SLT\u2019s  monopoly of the independent gateway; and\n(vi)  establishment of a  working group for Legal Reform of the Financial  Sector.\n(ii) Tranche 2 - $10 million\n117. The second tranche of $10 million will be released upon fulfillment of the following\nactions, expected by June 2003:\n(i)  submission of a national strategy paper for SME development by the SME task\nforce;\n(ii)  elimination of the stamp duty on imports;\n(iii)  submission of an agreed upon tax reform strategy paper and action plan for the\nmediumterm;\n(iv)  implementation  of  the  first  phase  of  reduction  in  corporate  income  tax,  in\naccordance with the time table  agreed upon in the tax reform action plan;\n(v)  rationalization  of  the  incentive  structure  through  harmonization  of  all  tax\nincentives in the Inland Revenue Act of the Borrower; and\n(vi)  elimination of SLT\u2019s monopoly in the provision of telephony services through the\nawarding of at least one more license for the  independent gateway.\n118. The  reforms  under  the  SDP  set  in  place  a  medium-term  framework  that  provides\ncapacity for (i) strategic guidance in the SME sector provided by the task force, (ii) day- to- day", "28\nassessments  of  SME-related  concerns  through  the  SME  Policy  Unit,  and  (iii)  policy  and\nregulatory management in the medium term by the Deregulation Committee to simplify the\nbusiness enabling environment. These initiatives will support and be supported by ongoing\nefforts to simplify the tax system and further deregulate the economy. In connection with the tax\nsystem, ADB and IMF have been jointly assisting the Government to develop a long-term\nagenda for reform for possible support through project and technical assistance (TA).  At the\nsame time, another project for assistance to the SME sector is being considered for possible\nADB support in 2004. Subject to progress made in the Program, this proposed project would\nconsolidate the reform agendas developed in the areas of secured transactions, deregulation,\nand other issues relevant to SME promotion.\n                 b.        Monitoring\n119. ADB will, in cooperation with the Government, carry out semiannual reviews of progress\nin project implementation, and will assess its impact on the enterprise and other sectors of the\neconomy. The Government will keep ADB informed of outcomes of the policy discussions with\nIMF and the World Bank Group and other multilateral and bilateral funding agencies that have\nimplications for SMESDP implementation.\n120. In addition to the semiannual progress reports, the Government will submit a program\ncompletion report to ADB within three months of the end of the program period. This report will\nevaluate the implementation of the policy reform measures under the SMESDP, their impact on\nthe economy and the enterprise sector, lessons learned during the program period, and further\nreforms and assistance needed for sector development. Monitoring indicators are provided in\nthe program framework (Appendix 3).\nB. The Investment Loan for the Business Services Support Facility\n1.  Amount of Loan, Terms, and Source of Funds\n121. The loan of $6 million equivalent will be provided from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. It\nwill  have a repayment period of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and  carry an\ninterest charge of 1.0 percent during the grace period and 1.5 percent thereafter. The loan will\nbe  used  to  finance  the  cost  of  consulting  contracts  and  procurement  associated  with  the\noperations of the BSSF. The Government will bear the foreign exchange risk of the loan.\n122. The EA will be the Ministry of Trade and Industry.\n2.  Procurement\n123. ADB-financed goods and services will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines\nfor Procurement. Bidding documents to be prepared will ensure maximum competition. The cost\nof individual procured items is not expected to exceed  $50,000. The list of items is expected to\ninclude automobiles (no more than two vehicles) and ICT for the BSSF.\n3.  Consulting Services\n124. The BSSF will have an international Director and two domestic experts plus an office\nmanager and one secretarial assistant. These services will be engaged in accordance with the\nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.", "29\n4.  Disbursement Procedures\n125. Since the disbursements will be for supply of goods and services, ADB\u2019s commitment\nand direct payment procedures will be used.\nC. The Investment Loan for the Lines of Credit to  Participating Credit Institutions\n1.  Amount of Loan, Terms, and Source of Funds\n126. The loan of $60 million will be provided from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to the\nGovernment as Borrower. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3\nyears; an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB's LIBOR-based lending facility; a\ncommitment charge of 0.75 percent per annum; a front- end fee of 1.0 percent; conversion\noptions that may be exercised in accordance with the terms of the draft loan agreement, the\nloan regulations and ADB's Conversion Guidelines; and such other terms and conditions set\nforth in the draft loan agreement. The Government will provide ADB with (a) the reasons for the\nGovernment's decision to borrow under ADB's LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of\nthese terms and conditions, and (b) an undertaking that these terms and conditions were the\nGovernment's own independent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or\nadvice of ADB.\n127. The Government will bear the foreign exchange risk of the loan. The Government will\nmake the loans available to the PCIs under a subsidiary loan agreement. The PCIs will onlend\nthe funds to SMEs at a rate that reflects the generally recognized cost of funds, the average\nweighted deposit rate (AWDR),  plus a spread that covers transaction costs and a return for risk.\n2.  Onlending and Relending\n128.   The  loan  will  have  the  same  terms  and  conditions  as  the  loan  from  ADB  to  the\nGovernment in relation to interest rates and front-end fee (1 percent of the loan amount). Loans\nto the PCIs will have maturities of 7-to10 years, with a grace period of 2 years. The Government\nwill absorb commitment charges on the ADB loan (0.75 percent per annum on increasing\nportions of the undisbursed loan amount beginning 60 days after loan signing). Loan funds to\nPCIs  will  be  allocated  on  a  first-come,  first-served  basis,  based  on  the  subborrowers'\napplication. The PCIs will onlend the proceeds of the subsidiary loans to eligible subborrowers\nfor a period of up to 10 years, including a grace period not exceeding 2 years. Subloan\nrepayment  schedules  will  be  based  on  the  cash-flow  projections  for  the  loan-financed\ninvestments. The Government will charge an onlending rate equal to the AWDR, unless this\nfalls to below 10 percent. In the latter event, the  Government will charge AWDR plus 1 percent,\nsubject to a cap of 10 percent when the AWDR is between 9 \u2013 10 percent.\n3. Subloan Size\n129. Subloan sizes will range up to SLRs35 million. PCIs will be free to determine the size of\nloans within this limit.\n4.  Selection of Participating Credit Institutions\n130. The PCIs for onlending of the credit line will be DFCC, HNB, CBC, NDB, and Sampath\nBank. The PCIs were selected on the basis of an expanded version of the Private Sector\nGroup\u2019s due diligence questionnaire. This has involved the review of the lending procedures", "30\nand performance, and project pipeline of the selected banks (see Appendix 9). These banks are\nsound  of  management,  operation,  and  financial  performance;  follow  prudent  practices  and\nperform due diligence in identifying and monitoring lending. The banks\u2019 past loans across a wide\nrange of subsectors were evaluated and found to be well selected. A review of future of projects\nindicate that they are likely to be similar in terms of returns.\n131. PCIs  must  meet  financial  and  operational  eligibility  criteria.  They  must  exceed  or\notherwise be in compliance with all applicable prudential regulations and guidelines of the\nCentral Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) including, but not limited to (i) capital adequacy ratio of at\nleast 9 percent as amended from time to time; (ii)  recognition of income and classification of\nassets, and valuation of security for all loans, leases and other advances; (iii)  maintaining\nrequired reserves for deposits; (iv)  limiting  total exposure to a single borrower or lessee to a\nmaximum of 30 percent  of shareholders\u2019 equity; and (v)  provisioning for nonperforming loans\nor other statutory or regulatory reserves. The banks will also have the following financial ratios:\n(i) a debt-service coverage ratio of at least 1.25:1 (ii) a long-term debt- to- equity ratio not\nexceeding 8:1 (iii) an annual collection ratio and the cumulative collection ratio of at least 80\npercent and (iv) a minimum return on average assets of at least 1 percent. Additionally, the\nbanks must be in compliance with maintenance of (i)SME nonperforming loans (encompassing\nsubstandard, doubtful and loss classifications) of less than 10 percent; and (ii) a loan loss rate\n(encompassing nonperforming loans of 18 months and over) on the SME portfolio under this\nloan window and the PCG, based on the complete listing of all loans that would meet the criteria\nfor qualified enterprises.\n132. To access funds, each PCI will: (i) have adopted a corporate mission statement on SME\nlending,  policies  and  procedures  focused  on  SME  loan  development,  processing  and\nadministration; (ii) ensure that nonperforming loans will be less than 15 percent of for the entire\nloan portfolio and less than 10 percent of the nonperforming loans in the SME loans portfolio;\nbut if it has more than 10 percent nonperforming loans, the PCI  will also have a general\nprovision for loan losses, which, when combined with the special provision of that amounts to at\nleast  25  percent  of  the  total  loan  volume  of  nonperforming  loans,  and  a  Board-approved\nstrategy  for reducing  nonperforming loans to below 10 percent within three years; (iii) have\nadopted loan policies and procedures acceptable to ADB that make use of the information\nprovided by the PCI\u2019s computerized loan management system for loan administration and\ncollection; (iv) have adopted a fully automated management information system able to produce\nmonthly reports on the bank\u2019s financial condition and its SME lending activity in all branches as\ndetermined necessary by ADB and submitted directly to  ADB electronically within 40 days after\nthe end of the month of the previous quarter\u2019s activity, except for year end financial statements,\nwhich will  be provided within 60 days of year end and an audited year end report within 120\ndays of the end of the fiscal year; (v) have initiated a program to develop and/or adopt a\nqualified enterprise loan scoring system tailored to each loan category thus facilitating express\nprocessing of qualified enterprise loan applications; and (vi) have certified that they are in\ncompliance  with  corporate  governance  standards  satisfactory  to  ADB  and  specified  in  the\nInstitute  of  Chartered  Accountants  of  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  Report  of  the  Committee  to  Make\nRecommendations on Matters Relating to Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance.\n133. Each bank will be required to adopt a fully computerized and parameterized reporting\nsystem covering (i) operational loan monitoring, (ii) socioeconomic monitoring, (iii) financial\nmonitoring, and (iv) performance ratios and indicators.", "31\n5.  Selection, Appraisal, and Approval of Subloans\n134. The investment loan will seek to finance economically and financially viable subloans in\na broad range of economic sectors. Special emphasis will be given to subloans for women\nentrepreneurs and to provinces with relatively high levels of poverty. All subloans must comply\nwith ADB's and the Government's social protection policies, including resettlement policies, and\nenvironmental standards. All subloans will be made against the same criteria of sound banking,\ncommercial, and financial practices, etc.\n135.  Privately owned SMEs that have total assets, excluding land and buildings, below\nSLRs35 million prior to subloans (and below Rs. 70 million after the subloans) and meet sound\nbanking, commercial, and financial criteria will be eligible for financing. The following additional\nfinancial criteria will be applied in selecting subloans: the subloan will have (i) an estimated\nfinancial internal rate of return of not less than the average weighted cost of capital, and (ii) an\neconomic internal rate of return not less than 12 percent.\n136. Each subloan application will be accompanied by the subloan feasibility report prepared\nby the PCI. The first three subloans of each PCI will be referred to ADB for approval.  After that,\nPCIs will be responsible for subloan approvals, subject to monitoring and review by ADB.\n6.  Implementation Arrangements\n137. Each PCI will establish a project implementation unit (PIU) in its credit department. The\nPlUs  will  coordinate  with  other  relevant  bank  departments  the  acquisition,  appraisal,  and\nmanagement of the subloans and ensure that ADB information and reporting requirements\nrelated to the PCI and the subloans are met. PCIs are expected to ensure that their SME credit\nmanagement is strengthened and will establish their own training programs or will avail of such\ntraining programs through commercial means. If necessary, they will avail of the services of the\nBSSF, on commercial terms, to acquire the needed training. ADB will further assess of the\nreadiness of the PCIs to avail of the lines of credit prior to loan effectiveness.\n7. Period of Utilization\n138. The closing date for submission of subloan applications for approval and authorization\nfor withdrawals will be four years after the date of loan effectiveness. The closing dates for\ndisbursements will be five years after the same date.\n8. Procurement\n139. ADB's Guidelines for Procurement applicable to DFIs will be followed. All procurement\nunder ADB-financed subloans will be made from ADB member countries. Subborrowers are\nrequired to (i) demonstrate that the procurement procedures adopted are appropriate in the\ncircumstances, and (ii) ensure that the goods and services to be financed by subloans are\npurchased at a reasonable price, given the time of delivery, efficiency, and reliability of the\ngoods, suitability for the subloan, availability of maintenance facilities and spare parts, and the\nquality and the competence of the parties rendering services. Subborrowers will be encouraged\nto  procure  loan-financed  goods  through  international  competitive  bidding  or  international\nshopping. Procurement will be conducted in a transparent manner to conform with ADB's anti-\ncorruption policy.", "32\n9. Disbursements\n140. For the credit assistance, responsibility for appropriately completing all withdrawal and\nliquidation  procedures  will  reside  with  the  PMU  of  the  EA,  the  MOFP.  For  the  credit\nenhancement, the individual banks will themselves take this responsibility. Thus, MOFP and the\nPCIs  for  credit  enhancement  will  be  responsible  for  collecting  supporting  documents,  and\npreparing withdrawal applications, and sending them to ADB in accordance with the ADB Loan\nDisbursement Handbook.\n10. Reporting Requirements\na.  External Audit\n141. The PCIs will have their accounts and financial statements (balance sheet, income\nstatement, and statement of sources and application of funds) audited annually in accordance\nwith sound and internationally accepted auditing standards by independent external auditors\nacceptable to ADB. For credit assistance and credit enhancement, respectively, the MOFP and\nPCIs will submit to ADB, not later than six months after the close of each financial year, their\naudited financial statements and the auditor's long-form audit report relating to supplementary\ninformation on their accounts, including an assessment of the quality of their long-term loans,\nadequacy of the provision for doubtful loans, and the PCIs corporate and financial governance\npractices.\n142. The  MOFP  and  PCIs  will  submit  to  ADB  reports  and  information  that  ADB  may\nreasonably request concerning the loan and its utilization; the subloans; other matters relating to\nthe purposes of the Project; quarterly progress reports, in a format to be agreed upon with ADB\nwithin 60 days after the end of the relevant quarter; and a project completion report, within three\nmonths of loan closing date.\nb. Charter and Management Changes\n143. The Government and the PCIs will ensure that ADB is given an opportunity to comment\non any substantial amendments proposed to the PCIs' charters. Unless ADB agrees, the PCIs\nwill (i) consult with ADB before making any changes in their operational policies that would\nmaterially  affect  project  implementation,  and  (ii)  inform  ADB  of  any  proposed  changes  in\nappointing the chief executive officer.\nD. The ADB Partial Credit Guarantee\n144. The  proposed  cofinancing  will  be  supported  by  ADB  partial  credit  guarantee.  ADB\nguarantee support is necessary because (i) the participating Sri Lankan banks (PCIs) cannot\naccess international financial markets on their own credit for the long-term required by the\nProgram, (ii) the SME subborrowers under the Program need credit on extended terms, which\nthe  PCIs  are  unable  to  provide  given  their  current  funding  base;  and  (iii)  the  PCIs  (and\nultimately,  sub-borrowers)  can  obtain  significantly  better  pricing  than  would  otherwise  be\npossible.", "33\nADB Partial Credit Guarantee Structure\nGovernment of Government of\nSri Lanka Sri Lanka\nCounter\nGuarantee\nGuarantee\n(Interest Repayments)\nADB\nPartial Credit\nGuarantee\n(Principal Repayments)\nCommercial Cofinanciers\nFC Loans\n(eligibility criteria) (access criteria)\nPCIs\n(Sinking Fund\nCBC; DFCC; HNB; NDB; Sampath\nfor Repayment)\n(Sub-loan Criteria) FC + Rs Loans\nSMEs\nNotations\nADB = Asian Development Bank\nCBC = Commercial Bank of Ceylon\nDFCC = DFCC Bank\nDFI = Development Finance Institutions\nFC = Foreign Currency\nHNB = Hatton National Bank\nNDB = National Development Bank of Sri Lanka\nPCIs = Participating Credit Institutions\nRs = Sri Lankan Rupees\nSME = Small and Medium Sized Enterprises", "34\n145. Processing of the cofinancing and the Guarantee will be initiated upon (i) disbursement\nof 50 percent of the $60 million for onlending to be provided from ADB\u2019s own resources; and (ii)\nthe Government having obtained the necessary legal amendments for it to provide the required\nguarantee and counterguarantee for all the PCIs, including the DFIs and the private commercial\nbanks. The amount of commercial cofinancing will be up to a maximum of $90 million, subject to\nconfirmation that this remains a reasonable figure in the light of economic conditions, debt-\nservicing capacity of SME endborrowers, the absorptive capacity of the PCIs, their financial\ncondition, and the status of compliance with prudential regulations and loan covenants. The\ndetailed structure and pricing of the cofinancing will be finalized on the basis of competitive\nproposals  solicited  from  potential  cofinanciers.  ADB\u2019s  guarantee  obligation  to  commercial\ncofinanciers is estimated to be about $53 million initially, assuming the cofinancing is for the full\namount  of  $90  million.10  Upon  finalization  of  the  commercial  cofinancing  and  guarantee\noperation, the staff will prepare a Board information paper describing the full particulars of the\ntransaction.\n146. In accordance with the revised policy covering PCGs, ADB will charge for its own\naccount (a) a front-end fee of 90 basis points on the face value of the PCG, and (b) a guarantee\nfee of 0.40 percent per annum against the present value of the ADB guarantee obligation. The\nGovernment will charge (a) a counterguarantee fee of 1 percent per annum against the face\nvalue of the ADB guarantee, and (b) a guarantee fee of 1 percent per annum against the face\nvalue of its guarantee of interest payments. The above arrangement is subject to clearance from\nthe Attorney General regarding the provision of a Government guarantee on interest payments\nto the private commercial banks, and further requires the Government to bear the foreign\nexchange risk. The structure of the commercial cofinancing (e.g., whether floating rate or fixed\nrate, the currency of the tranches, drawdowns, etc.) will be determined subsequently in the light\nof  market  soundings  and  the  evaluation  of  financing  offers  submitted  by  prospective\ncofinanciers. Cofinanciers will be selected on a competitive basis in accordance with ADB\npolicies and procedures.\n147. It is envisaged that a syndicate of international commercial lenders will provide the\ncofinancing. The commercial lenders will enter into a separate loan agreement with each of the\nfive participating Sri Lankan banks.  The cofinanciers and a lead borrowing bank will negotiate\nstandard documentation for the proposed cofinancing.  The documentation will be modified to\nreflect the specific terms and conditions of the five borrowers (e.g., with respect to cofinancing\namounts,  repayment  amounts,  etc.).  Based  on  initial  market  soundings,  the  commercial\ncofinancing is expected to have a final maturity of 10 years.  The ADB guarantee will cover the\nrepayment  of  principal,  while  the  Government  will  guarantee  interest  payments  and\ncounterguarantee  the  ADB  guarantee.  Additional  information  concerning  the  proposed\ncommercial cofinancing and the ADB guarantee is provided in Appendix 10.\nE. Implementation Arrangements\n1. Project Organization\n148. MOFP will constitute a project steering committee (PSC) at project start-up, with the\nSecretary of the Treasury as chair. The PSC will be so constituted as to be able to solve any\nimplementation issues that arise. Founding members of the PSC will comprise representatives\nfrom MOFP, Ministry of Industrial Development, CBSL, PCIs, Deregulation Committee, and\nChamber of Commerce. The PSC will be responsible for overall guidance and direction of the\n                                                          \n10\nBased on the present value of the ADB guarantee as shown in Table A10, Appendix 10.", "35\nProgram and will guide a Project Management Unit to be established for coordinating activities\nbetween the various beneficiaries of the Program. The PSC will meet once every quarter and\ngive guidance on its implementation. The PSC chair will liaise between the Program and ADB\non all matters requiring changed allocations of project funds.\n149. The PMU will (i) be responsible for the day-to-day execution particularly of its business\nservices development and credit line component; (ii) will handle administration and financial\nreporting,  coordinating  the  inputs  of  the  institutions  participating  in  BSSF  and  credit  line\ncomponents, and provide secretariat functions for the PSC and its subcommittees; and (iii) be\nresponsible for ensuring that reporting requirements of ADB are satisfied. In addition to the\nProject Director, PMU will have an administrative staff consisting of an accountant, a banking\nspecialist and a project officer to manage the Project\u2019s coordination.  Appendix 7 gives the\nterms of reference for the PMU.\n2.  Disbursements\n150. Loan proceeds for the credit assistance will be made available to the Government for\nrelending to PCIs via subsidiary loan agreements on a first-come first-serve basis. The loan\nproceeds  may  be  used  to  finance  expenditure  incurred  not  earlier  than  180  days  before\nwithdrawal of the loan amount. Funding under the proposed PCG will be received by the PCIs in\na single payment on closing. For the BSSF component, an imprest account will be established\nin CBSL   . The initial amount to be deposited into this account will not exceed the equivalent of\n$600,000. After the initial deposit, the account will thereafter be simultaneously liquidated and\nreplenished  on  a  regular  basis  to  ensure  that  sufficient  funds  are  available  for  project\nimplementation.\n3. Reports, Accounts, and Audit\n151. The PMU will prepare quarterly progress reports for the Program for the periods ending\n31 March, 30 June, 30 September, and 31 December of each year, and will submit them to ADB\nthrough MOFP no later than 30 days after the end of the relevant period. The reports will be in a\nformat acceptable to ADB and will include (i) information on the progress of implementation, (ii)\nimplementation  issues  encountered  and  measures  adopted  for  their  resolution,  and  (iii)\ninformation on the status of compliance with the loan covenants. The reports will also include\ninformation on operations and performance of participating financial institutions. Furthermore,\nthe PMU will submit brief monthly progress reports via fax or E-mail. The PMU will also submit\nto ADB all reports prepared by consultants recruited under the loan and TA .\n152. The Government, acting through MOFP, will maintain consistent records and accounts\nadequate to identify goods and services financed from the proceeds of the loan. MOFP will (i)\nmaintain separate accounts for the Program, and (ii) ensure that accounts and related financial\nstatements are audited annually in accordance with international accounting standards by the\nauditors acceptable to ADB. Accounts of the PCIs will be based on an annual basis. The PMU\nwill submit to ADB certified copies of the audited accounts and financial statements in the\nEnglish language within six months after the end of each fiscal year. In addition, PCIs will\nsubmit  semiannual  unaudited  accounts  to  the  PMU.  Annual  audit  of  the  BSSF  by  a  firm\napproved by ADB will be undertaken and forwarded to ADB within three months after the end of\nthe half-year and fiscal year. Detailed quarterly reports of the financial position of the funds\nunder the BSSF, with itemized income and disbursements, will be sent to ADB every four\nmonths, within one month after the period ends. A project completion report will be prepared\nthree months after the completion of the project.", "36\n153. The BSSF will be managed through the PMU, which will in turn report to the PSC. The\nBSSF funding will be held in an imprest account with CBSL.  Details of the BSSF operations will\nbe documented in a memorandum of understanding between MOFP and the PMU, which will be\ndrafted and executed in a manner acceptable to ADB. The PMU will monitor the activities of\nBDS providers contracted to deliver services, and present summary reports to the PSC on a\nquarterly basis. Progress reports by the institutions participating with the BSSF will form part of\nthe contract agreed to by the parties.\n154.   ADB  will  monitor  socioeconomic  and  environmental  benefits  of  the  subloans.  In\naddition, subloans will be selected for ongoing, long-term benefit monitoring and evaluation.\nADB  has  provided  specific  computerized  and  parameterized  data  collection  and  reporting\nformats for use by the PCIs.\nVI.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\n155. The Government has requested TA from ADB for enabling SME Growth, principally for\nsupporting advisory work and capacity building under the SDP. The proposed TA will have four\ncomponents. First, support for establishing of a SME policy unit which is expected to initiate a\nmajor effort in conducting a baseline survey for SMEs, and in preparing reviews of the enabling\nenvironment for biases against SMEs.  Second, support to the Deregulation Committee in its\nwork to identify impediments to investment by both foreign and domestic firms, large firms, and\nSMEs.  In  addition  to  studies,  the  committee's  hearings  and  workshops  are  expected  to\ncontribute significantly to improving the consultative process between the private sector and the\nGovernment. Third, to prepare the ground for reforms to improve SME access to nonbank\nfinance, support will be provided for a study of the legal framework for secured transactions.\nFourth, support will be given to promote greater use of IT by SMEs. This component envisages\ndevelopment of a SME portal, SME directory, and assistance to promote partnerships between\nIT-based BDS providers and NGOs.\n156. The TA will require 22 person-months of international and 30 person-months of domestic\nconsulting services. The combined TA cost is estimated at $1,580,000 equivalent comprising\n$865,000 in foreign exchange and $715,000 equivalent in local currency. ADB will provide\n$1,250,000 to cover the foreign exchange costs of $865,000 and $385,000 equivalent of the\nlocal currency component. The TA will be financed by ADB on a grant basis from the Japan\nSpecial Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The balance in local currency cost in the\namount of $330,000 equivalent will be financed by the Government. Appendix 6 provides details\nof the cost estimates and financing plan.\n157. The TA is expected to start in January 2002. The Ministry of Trade and Industry will be\nthe EA.\nVII. BENEFITS AND RISKS\nA.  Expected Impacts\n1.  Policy Reforms and Capacity Building\n158. In the short term, adjustment costs will be significant. These will be mitigated over the\nmedium term by major benefits from the policy reforms under the Program. The principal benefit\nis a more transparent policy framework for business. This will benefit SMEs, which will face a", "37\nmore predictable and less costly business environment. The more conducive policy environment\nwill  promote  broad-based  growth  through  business  start-ups  and  expansion  of  existing\nbusinesses. The impact will be aided through the provision of capacity building for SMEs and\nbanks by the BSSF, and the provision of credit for SME projects, which will help the sector to\ngrow.  An expanding SME sector will stimulate the demand for labor from the household sector\nwhere the poor are predominantly found. It will lead to the shifting of workers from agriculture\nand nonwage employment to jobs of higher productivity and higher wages in industry and\nservices. This growth in overall employment and the intersectoral shifting of workers will reduce\npoverty.\n159. Over the medium term, the Government will benefit from improved capabilities in SME\npolicy formulation, while stakeholders will have more effective input into policy design and\nimplementation.\n160.  Income and employment generation will be significant. Using employment generation\ncoefficients from previous ADB-financed loan projects to Sri Lanka, and assuming a reduction of\nabout 20 percent in this coefficient in view of the higher maximum loan size, gross employment\nfrom the credit component alone is expected to be of the order of 65,000 new jobs. However, as\n40 percent of new SMEs are expected to go out of business (admittedly over an eight-year\nperiod), the result in the long term is net employment creation of about 40,000. Most of the jobs\ncreated will be in the manufacturing sector, but a significant amount will be in nonmanufacturing\nsectors where poverty incidence is greatest, especially among casual or contractual workers,\nincluding women.\n161. The new jobs will reduce disguised unemployment and underemployment among the\nless educated low-income people, and thus help in reducing the extent of poverty. The Program\nwill have only a limited impact on the hard-core poor, who are mostly assetless people who live\nin remote areas and have very little skills or education. It is the marginally poor who are more\nlikely to benefit, as they possess the education, skills, and the aptitude that are needed to do\nwell in a modern business environment.\n162. Since women traditionally account for nearly half of production workers in the SME\nsector, the Project should have a favorable impact on the employment and income of women.\nBecause women are traditionally underrepresented in the ranks of entrepreneurs the situation\ncalls for special attention to the needs of women entrepreneurs.\n163. To  address  the  above  concerns,  subloan  selection  for  women  entrepreneurs  and\nrelatively  poor  regions  will  receive  special  emphasis.  These  loans  will  be  provided  on\ncommercial terms. The poverty impact assessment is in Appendix 11.\n2.  Environmental Impacts\n164. New  investments  or  expansion  of  SME  activities  that  will  be  funded  by  the  credit\ncomponent may generate potential impacts. However, the Government\u2019s strong enforcement on\nthe EIA regulation will automatically screen SME activities. In addition, the PCIs experience in\npromoting  environmental  protection  will  ensure  that  only  SME  activities  that  comply  with\nenvironmental  regulations  would  be  funded  by  this  credit  component.  Therefore,  the\nenvironmental impacts associated with the credit component will not be significant.\n165. Similarly, the Credit Enhancement is not expected to generate environmental impacts.", "38\nB.  Risks and Safeguards\n166. There is a risk is that the enabling environment will remain biased against SMEs. This is\nmitigated by (i) a consultative process in decision making; (ii) the establishment of the SME\npolicy  unit,  which  will  periodically  review  the  enabling  environment,  (iii)  a  deregulation\ncommittee that will develop deregulation proposals; and (iv) the Government\u2019s commitment to\nmake a public response to the deregulation committee\u2019s report through Parliamentary debate on\nits response, and the reasons for it.\n167. A second risk is that the market for BDS does not respond sufficiently, thus limiting\ncapacity building for SMEs. While this risk is judged to be minor, a related risk is  that the wrong\nelements of the market respond, wasting resources that are used to solicit aid agency support,\nrather than serve the SME market productively. This risk is mitigated by the flexible design of\nthe facility for BDS support. Surveys and other methods will be used to obtain feedback and\nidentify continuously the key supply- and demand-side areas needing stimulation.\n168. Third, an inherent risk is that policy and institutional reforms alone will not ensure\nfinancing for firms with viable projects. This risk is partly mitigated by capacity building for SMEs\nthat will make them better credit risks, and the provision of significant credit resources to\nfinancial institutions under the SDP for onlending to SMEs. The risk is further mitigated by the\nproject\u2019s  requirement  that  banks\u2019  adopt  credit  scoring  techniques  and  invest  in  ICT  and\nmanagement information systems to lower unit transaction costs of lending to SMEs.  Finally,\nlegal reform that will strengthen competition among banks will mitigate this risk further still.\n169.  Fourth, banks may not be able to lend to SMEs on a sustainable basis because of\ninability to access long-term funds. This implies the continued need for aid agency or public\nsector  support  to  promote  financing.  This  risk  is  partly  mitigated  by  changes  to  the  legal\nframework, which will permit the provision of public guarantees to a wider range of financial\ninstitutions for the purpose of facilitating access to finance. However, in terms of access to\ninternational capital markets, this risk cannot be fully mitigated so long as Sri Lanka is unable to\nobtain a sovereign debt rating, for which an end to the ongoing civil strife is necessary.\n170. Finally, adverse transitional consequences of restructuring and labor retrenchment could\nprovoke  resistance  from  affected  groups,  slow  the  pace  of  reforms,  and  jeopardize  their\nsustainability. This risk is mitigated by the Government\u2019s strong commitment to the reform\nagenda as well as by the provision of funding under the SDP to support transfer programs. In\naddition, measures taken to reduce economic rent seeking are expected to strengthen public\nconfidence in the reform program.\nVIII.  ASSURANCES\nA. Specific Assurances\n171.

This  letter  spells  out  the  objectives  of the  Government's  Sector  Development\nProgram  for Small and Medium  Enterprise.  Sri Lanka faces  critical challenges  related  to\ndiversification  of the  economy,  improving  competitiveness,  and  expanding  employment\nopportunities.  The Government  feels that SMEs will play an increasingly  important  role in\nmeeting  these  challenges.  Accordingly,  the  Government  is  embarking  on  policy  and\ninstitutional  reforms  in order  to create  a dynamic  SME  sector,  enhance  its capabilities\nand competitiveness.,  create jobs; and1n doing-this;-reduce  poverty.\nA. The Program\n2.  The  Reform  program  encompasses  a  three-pronged  approach  (i)  creation  of\nenabling  environment  for  SMEs  development  through  deregulation  and tax  reforms;  (ii)\ngenerating  business  opportunities  for  SMEs  through  improving  business  development\nservices;  and (iii) catalyzing  private  sector investments.  through  improving  SMEs  access\nto financing  from commercial  banks and DFls.\n1.  Development  and Implementation  of the SME Strategy\n3.  The  Government  seeks  to  develop  a  coherent  SME  sector  strategy  and  is\ngradually  including  private  sector  in policy formulation  and administrative  reform  related\nto  SMEs  development.  while  improving  its  capacity  to  monitor  and  evaluate  policy\nimpact.  The  Government's  objective  is to  reduce  its direct  intervention  in provision  of\nbusiness  development  services,  and instead  is concentrating  on creating  of the enabling\nenvironment  for SMEs development.\n4.  To  this  effect,  the  Government  is initiating  a SME  White  Paper,  which,  prior  to\nrelease  of  the  second  tranche  of the  program  component  of the  Sector  Development\nProgram  will  spell  out the vision  and strategy  for the SME sector  for the  medium  term,\ntaking  into  account  Sri  Lanka's  experience  and  international  best  practices.  A  Task\nForce  on  SME  Development,  which  comprises  representatives  from  the  Government\nand  private  sector,  has  been  established  to  prepare  this  strategy.  To  ensure  that  the\nvision  and  strategy  outlined  in the  White  Paper  is  implemen~ed  effectively  and  in  a", "43\nAppendix  1, page  2\ncoordinated  manner,  the  Government  will  set  up SME  Policy  Unit under  the  Ministry  of\nTrade  and Industry , which  will act as a one-stop-shop  for SMEs  issues.\n2.  Deregulation  and Rationalization  of Incentives  Framework\n5.  The  Government  realizes  that  SMEs  development  will  require  reducing  the\nregulatory  burden  placed  on  enterprises  through  simplifying  and  streamlining  the\ncomplex  regulatory  and incentive  system,  in order  to make  it more attuned  to the current\nliberalized  trade  environment.  Accordingly,  the  Government  has  established  a\nDeregulation  Committee,  led  by  the  private  sector,  which  will  oversee  deregulation\nefforts.  The  task  of the  committee  will  be to identify  the  impediments  to investments  in\nparticular  sectors,  and  develop  general  criteria  and  guidelines  for  evaluating  the  costs\nand benefits  of regulations.\n6.  In respect  of tax  reforms,  under  the  SMESDP,  the  key  objectives  will  be to  (i)\nbegin  with the process  of rationalization  and subsequent  elimination  of archaic  taxes  that\nraise  transactions  costs  for business-principally  through  stamp  duties  and the turnover\ntax  on  the  banking  system,  (ii)  reduce  the  bias  toward  investments  by  large  firms  by\nmoving  towards  a  lower  single  flat  rate  of  corporate  tax,  and  (iii)  to  achieve  greater\ntransparency  in the  incentive  structure-and  improved  allocation  of  resources.  In this\nconnection  the  Government  has  completed  the  following  actions:  (i)  elimination  of the\nturnover  tax on banking,  and a reduction  by 1 percentage  point  of the National  Security\nLevy;  (ii)  reduction  from  2 percent  to  1 percent  of the  stamp  duty  on  imports;  and  (iii)\nelimination  of the Save the Nation  Contribution.\n7.  Prior to release  of the second  tranche,  a tax reform  strategy  with  specific  targets\nover  the medium-term  will  be announced  by March  2002.  This  will include  elimination  of\nstamp  duties  on imports,  and the harmonization  of tax incentives  in the  Inland  Revenue\nAct.  In  addition,  the  corporate  tax  rate  will  be  reduced  from  its  current  level  of  35\npercent,  in  an  amount  to  be  determined  in the  light  of  revenue  expectations  and  as\nagreed  with the ADB  and the IMF.\n3. Promoting  a Level  Playing  Field  in the  Market  for  Finance\n8.  The  Government  recognizes  the  importance  of  institutional  and  market\ndevelopment  to  ensure  sustainable  financing  for  SMEs.  In this  connection,  there  has\nbeen  an increasing  blurring  of the dividing  line between  DFls  and  private  banks.  In this\nconnection  there  is the  need  to ensure  that  both  DFls  and  private  commercial  banks  in\nSri  Lanka  are  equally  encouraged  to  provide  credit  to  SMEs  without  discriminatory\nimpediments  to either  DFls  or private  banks.\n9.  With  declining  access  to  low  cost  loans  from  multilateral  sources  it  will  be\nessential  for the  DFls  to raise  resources  from  other  sources  if they  are to compete  with\nother  banks.  To provide  a level  playing  field,  the Government  will review  the Banking  Act\nand  Monetary  Law with  a view to effecting  amendments  that  remove  impediments  to the\nDFls  in  offering  current  accounts  or  establishing  foreign  currency  units  currently\npermitted  to the  private  banks.  Conversely,  the  Government  will  examine  the  need  to\nmake  amendments  to the  Foreign  Loans  act to bring  the private  commercial  banks  into\nthe  fold  of  its  public  guarantees.  In  this  connection  it  is  expected  that  careful\nconsideration  will  be  given  to  basing  the  provision  of a  public  guarantee  on  carefully\ncircumscribed  public  interest  grounds  to reduce  the likelihood  of moral  hazard.\n4.\nImproving  Access  to Information  Technology  (IT)\n10.  The  Government  recognizes  an  important  role  which  IT  can  play  in  SMEs\ndevelopment  by reducing  the costs of doing  business,  improving  linkages  with the global", "44\nAppendix  1, page  3\neconomy,  and  spreading  information  and  knowledge  into  remote  areas.  A  number  of\nconstraints  inhibit  wider  use  of  IT services  by  SMEs,  most  important  of which  limited\ninfrastructure,  absence  of  level  playing  field  for  commercial  users,  and  Sri  Lanka\nTelecom  (SL T) monopoly  in provision  of some of the services.\n11.  In  order  to  address  these  constraints,  the  Government  is  developing  an\nintegrated  strategy  to facilitate  wider  use of IT in general,  and  Internet  in particular,  by\nSMEs.  As a part  of this  strategy,  the  Government  will  remove  the  monopoly  of  SL T  in\nprovision  of  high  value  telecommunication  services,  i.e.  independent  gateway.  In  the\nnear  term,  the  Government  will  focus  on  improving  external  availability  of  information\nabout  business  opportunities  in Sri Lanka via Internet.\n5. Reform of Collateral  and Debt Recovery  Procedures\n12.  SME development  requires  access  to reasonably  priced  financial  services,  which\nin turn  hinges  on an effective  legal  framework  for  creation,  priority,  and  enforcement  of\nsecurity  interests  in movable  property .One  of the  effects  of the  lack  of  an  upgraded\nsecured  transactions  legal  framework  is  SMEs'  dependence  on  bank  credit.  The\nGovernment  is  aiming  to  rectify  this  problem  by  reforming  the  current  secured\ntransactions  regime  by  drafting  and  implementing  of  secured  transactions  legislation.\nThe  enactment  of  suitable  secured  transactions  legal  will  form  the  basis  for  a future\ndevelopment  of modern  electronic  secured  transactions  registry .\nB. Other  Aspects\n13.  The  Government  believes  that while  policy  reforms  described  above  will  provide\nenabling  conditions  for  SMEs  development  in Sri Lanka,  they  need  to be  accompanied\nproject  interventions  aimed  at improving  access  to business  development  services  and\nfinancing  by SMEs.  To this end,  policy  intervention  will  be accompanied  bya  project  to\nstrengthen  SME capacities  through  development  of the market  for the  provision  of BDS,\nand  line of credit  through  participating  financial  institutions,  linked  to their  strengthened\ncapacity  to  provide  credit  to SMEs  on  a sustainable  basis  on  commercial  terms.  The\nGovernment  also seeks  additional  funds  for on lending,  to be raised  through  commercial\nco-financing,  for which  the ADB  partial  guarantee  is requested  for principal  repayments.\nc. The Government's  Request\n14.  The  Government  with ADB  assistance  has prepared  a program  of reforms  aimed\nat SMEs  development,  which  we believe  will  contribute  significantly  to economic  growth\nand poverty  alleviation  in Sri Lanka.  The Government  is fully  committed  to the objectives\nof the  Program  and  is confident  that,  with  the  assistance  of the  ADB,  it will  be  able  to\nachieve  these  objectives.  Therefore,  I would  like to request  that  ADB  consider  favorably\nthe Government's  request.\nYours sincerely,", "POLICY MATRIX\nPolicy Framework\nObjectives Prior to Board Circulation Prior to Release of Second During Program Period\nDecember 2001 Tranche\nJune 20031\nI.

The SME Policy Unit will receive advisory assistance in carrying out its policy evaluation\nfunctions, and in preparing the format for monitoring Government agencies for the SME impacts\nof their legislation. It will also be assisted to address the problem of lack of accurate statistics\nabout SMEs in Sri Lanka. The plan is to carry out an annual survey of industries to collect\nstatistics. The statistics will be recorded in a computer database to allow the information to be\nretrieved when needed and for yearly statistics to be combined. The paper-based format for the\nsurvey will be developed in the light of the survey carried out by the Asian Development Bank.\nThe SME Policy Unit and the Ministry of Trade and Industry will be assisted to plan and execute\nthe survey and also to tabulate and publish results on the web.\n2.

Recognizing the need to compete for resources in a globalized world with several fully\nderegulated  countries  such  as  Dubai,  Singapore,  Hong  Kong  China,  and  others,  the\nGovernment established the Deregulation Committee under the Advisory Council to the minister\nof industry to provide recommendations to improve Sri Lanka\u2019s competitiveness. Under the TA,\nthe committee will be assisted\u2013entries to position itself for increased inflow of investment into Sri\nLanka by undertaking the following activities:\n(i)  Review commercial regulation and laws constraining competition or imposing\nhigh and unnecessary compliance costs.", "Appendix 6, page 2\n55\n(ii)  Remove impediments (including true costs) to setting up a business or making\nan investment in Sri Lanka.\n(iii)  Reduce the public-private interface (reporting requirements, permission, record\nkeeping, discretionary authority of public officials in granting approvals, etc.) to a\nminimum.\n(iv)  Review markets and market development in Sri Lanka to\n(a) streamline regulations, and\n(b) facilitate market development in recognition of the fact that ultimately market\ndevelopment is what induces investment and growth.\n4. The  Deregulation  Committee  will  lead  the  deregulation  effort  through  the  following\nactivities:\n(i)  Developing an awareness of deregulation through study and debate, periodic\nconsultations, public hearing, and conferences.\n(ii)  Develop and publish deregulation studies to\n(a) identify  areas  and  sectors  where  detailed  deregulation  studies  may  be\nrequired,\n(b) prepare terms of reference for such studies and commission them, and\n(c) publish and disseminate the results of such studies.\n(iii)  Prepare a deregulation white paper\n5.

The process will include\nvetting these procedures and more importantly, publicizing them. The vetting process will be\ndone with public-private partnership, to get on board those who might oppose reform, and will\ntake place not only in Colombo, but throughout the country to get an idea of any regional effects\non certain processes.\n7. The committee will be assisted domestic and international consultants in holding of\nworkshops, etc.\n3. Secured Transactions Law Reform\n(i) International consultants: Lawyers (2 at 3.5 person-months each)\n(ii) Domestic consultants: Lawyers (2 at 4 person-months each)\n8. The  Project  will  support  the  reform  of  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  secured  transactions  regime  by\ndrafting secured transactions legislation under advisory technical assistance. This is expected to\nbe undertaken through a grant TA that will make a detailed review of relevant legal issues. The\nlegal issues covered will include laws for bankruptcy, parate, debt recovery, use of credit\ninformation bureaus, etc. A suitable secured transactions legal regime based on such draft\nlegislation  will  form  the  basis  for  future  development  of  a  modern,  electronic,  secured\ntransactions registry.\n4. Promoting Information Technology (IT)\n(i) International consultant: IT expert (3 person-months)\n(ii) Domestic consultant: IT expert (5 person-months)\na.  SME E-Commerce Portal with an Overseas Focus\n9. SME\u2019s in Sri Lanka require a web portal/e-commerce site to market their products and\nservices. Many SMEs sell small volumes directly to the consumer. Therefore any web portal for\nSMEs should have the needs of these consumers in mind. The web portal/e-commerce site\nshould provide a mechanism for SMEs to sell directly over the Internet. The preferred method of\npayment for goods on the Internet is the credit card. There are more of credit cards among\nconsumers overseas than in Sri Lanka. Thus, it would be prudent to focus an SME web site on\nthe overseas market. The Internet provides an inexpensive channel to overseas markets and a\nwell-designed e-commerce portal will expose the SMEs to the world.", "Appendix 6, page 4\n57\n10. The objective is to develop a web site able to handle payments by credit card for\nconsumer and small business transactions, or by letters of credit for orders of a commercial\nscale. The web site will offer SMEs in Sri Lanka a high-quality shop window to display their\nwares. It should be based on a framework and a methodology that have been tested and proven\nto work. The web site will be managed by a private company under contract to the Government\nof Sri Lanka. The TA will examine the feasibility of adapting existing non-commercial portals to\nthis purpose. Alternatively, a partnership will be sought with an organization that has experience\nin developing and managing business-to-consumer and business-to-business web sites. E-\ncommerce sites in the People\u2019s Republic of China, Thailand, and Viet Nam will be researched in\ndetail to determine the best strategy for implementing such an SME e-commerce portal and the\npracticalities of its operation. The Thai Ministry of Commerce\u2019s e-commerce initiative will also be\nexamined for lessons that may be applicable to Sri Lanka.\nb. Promoting  Business  Development  Service/Business  Information\nService\n11. The  aim  of  a  business  development  service  (BDS)  is  to  assist  SMEs  sustain  and\ndevelop their businesses by providing expertise that the SMEs do not ordinarily have access to.\nThe aim of a business information service (BIS) is to support the objectives of the BDS by\nassisting SMEs with market research, trade promotion, and improving purchasing decisions by\nmaking  the  market  transparent.  One  beneficial  service  that  a  BDS/BIS  can  provide  is  to\nencourage the use of technology and foster familiarity with the Internet. To be successful, an\nestablished BDS/BIS model must:\n(i)  provide services that SMEs require,\n(ii)  be sustainable, and\n(iii)  be replicable.\n12. The  grant  will  assist  a  provider  of  information  services  to  SMEs,  demonstrating  a\ndemand-based  business  model  forming  a  partnership  with  Sarvodaya,  the  largest  non-\ngovernment organization in Sri Lanka. The aim is to leverage the infrastructure Sarvodaya has\ninstalled  for  telecenters  aimed  at  improving  IT  awareness  and  information  throughout  the\ncountry. The telecenters are a viable concept and earn revenue for Sarvodaya through the sale\nof a variety of services provided at the sites. The location of a BDS/BIS on its premises will\nallow Sarvodaya to expand the range of services it can offer beyond the microenterprises it\ncurrently serves. More walk-in business can be expected from a Sarvodaya-based location than\none located at, say, a chamber of commerce, which may seem relatively unapproachable to the\nowner of an average SME. Sarvodaya can also offer the prospect that the BDS will obtain a\nsteady inflow of business for office-related services that will cover operating costs (over and\nabove whatever use the SMEs gain from the BDS/BIS).\n13. Kurunegala, a rapidly growing commercial town, may be a suitable location for such a\nBDS/BIS  combination.  It  may  also  be  possible  to  incorporate  a  number  of  the  features\ndiscussed  above  into  a  support  office  for  the  Dambulla  Dedicated  Economic  Center.  If\nsuccessful at one site, the enterprise can be replicated through Sarvodaya\u2019s national network.\n14. Funding will be provided for the purchase of computers, software, and a photocopier and\na portion of operational expenses.", "Appendix 6, page 5\n58\nc. Ministry of Trade and Industry and SME Policy Unit\n15. The ministry and the unit will be assisted in developing a web site for SME-related\ninformation and with processes for business registration: how to set up a business, how to\narrange insurance, related regulations, and documentation. The grant will cover the initial costs\nof web site development, and hosting and maintenance costs of the site.\nB. Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n16. The TA cost is estimated at $1,580,000 equivalent, comprising $865,000 in foreign\nexchange and $715,000 equivalent in local currency. ADB will provide $1,250,000 to cover the\nforeign exchange costs of $865,000 and $385,000 equivalent of the local currency component.\nThe TA will be financed by ADB on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the\nGovernment of Japan. The balance in local currency cost in the amount of $330,000 equivalent\nwill be financed by the Government. The Ministry of Trade and Industry will be the Executing\nAgency.

Other Staff\n4. The PMU staff will include a domestically  recruited accountant, banking/project expert,\nMIS/IT expert and office manager who will assist the Director in coordinating all aspects of\nproject administration.\nB. Business Services Support Facility\n1. Rationale\n5. Traditionally, SME development relied on direct and subsidized provision of financial and\nnonfinancial services to SMEs. One drawback to this direct approach is that it has no significant\nreach. A typical project staff consists of a few professionals who can directly reach a limited\nnumber of SMEs. A second, more detrimental aspect of the direct approach is that it tends to\nundercut the emergence of a local BDS industry. The development of an indigenous BDS\nindustry permits permanency and reach that no time-bound project can attain.\n6. The SMESDP design purposely includes three critical factors that will enable SMEs to\ngrow: appropriate enabling environment, access to necessary capital, and provision of BDS.\nThe integrated model to SME development seeks to amend the provision of credit financing with\na strong BDS provider market as a means of stimulating SME development. This will be\nachieved via the BSSF, which will complement the policy and regulatory and SME finance\ncomponents of the SMESDP loan.", "Appendix 7, page 4\n63\n2. Objective\n7. The BSSF will provide sustainable funding for business development activities directed\nat the SME sector. Rather than becoming a BDS in its own right, the BSSF will be used to build\nthe capacity of the local private sector BDS providers. The BSSF will be used to purchase\nbusiness  training,  and  advisory  and  monitoring  activities  from  accredited  business  service\nproviders working closely with the target groups, in support of other project components.\n8. The BSSF will seek to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the BDS market to\nidentify and respond to SME service demands by stimulating new ideas and assisting BDS\nproviders and facilitators in formulating product services that make sense, respond to concrete\nneeds, and contribute to SME growth.\n9. In attempting to address the problems confronting SMEs, the BSSF will seek to expand\nthe circle of BDS providers beyond the common government agencies and nongovernment\norganizations  typically  thought  of  in  Sri  Lanka,  i.e.,  Industrial  Development  Board,  Export\nDevelopment  Board,  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise  Development,  Sri  Lanka  Business\nDevelopment Center, SEEDS, ITMIN, and one or two others. The BSSF will also redefine the\ncommonly held notion that BDS means only business planning and training.\n3. Scope of Activities and Services\n10. The BSSF defines BDS as any type of nonloan service that seeks to improve SME\nperformance, access to markets, and competitiveness. The range of BDS as defined is broader\nthan planning and training and can include marketing and advertising, market information,\nmarket  research,  product  development,  personnel  training,  corporate  secretarial,  computer\nservices  and  information  technology,  engineering,  organizational  restructuring,  process\nengineering, business diagnostic, legal counseling, brokering, vocational training, and many\nothers. To be considered a BDS, a service must be geared toward SMEs and relevant to\ncompany growth.\n11. With such a broad definition, new categories of BDS providers are created. In this\nrespect, the BSSF will actively seek to bring into the BDS market untapped or infrequently\nconsidered  providers,  e.g.,  The  Training  Partnership,  Survey  Research  Lanka  Ltd.,\nBusinesscontact Ltd., TEAMS, Informatics, DMS Software Engineering Ltd., SSP Corporate\nServices Ltd., Marketing and Research Services, KOMPASS, and other private, for-profit BDS\nproviders that have proven quality service products. Some of these firms do not actively target\nthe SME clientele, while for others SMEs are but a small percentage of total business. By\npromoting awareness among SMEs of BDS providers, offering demand-side incentives such as\nvouchers and supply-side activities, e.g., service development matching grants, the BSSF can\nbring new entrants into the BDS market (a tentative schedule of BSSF activities is in Figure A7).\n12. BSSF services can include the following:\n(i)  A voucher program through which SMEs receive a coupon for partial payment of\nan  approved  business  service.  Through  the  voucher,  SMEs  that  may  not\nnormally think of a BDS or consider it affordable can test the services at an\naffordable cost.\n(ii)  A  matching  grant  program  that  targets  BDS  providers  who  are  seeking\nassistance to right-size an existing service or develop a new one for SMEs.", "Appendix 7, page 5\n64\nThrough the matching grant, the BSSF will contribute up to perhaps 50 percent\nof the costs of such service product development work.\n(iii)  Training-of-trainer programs to uplift the skills of BDS providers so they can offer\nquality services to SME clients.\n(iv)  Needs assessments to identify SME requirements with respect to BDS so as to\nbetter inform the service providers.\n(v)  Marketing campaigns to inform and educate SMEs regarding the value that\noutside expert services can add to the company.\n(vi)  Enhancement of BDS facilitator capacity so that such entities can better perform\ntheir role as brokers of BDS on behalf of members.\n4. Funding Base and Cost Estimates\n13. The BSSF will be financed with a $6 million loan from ADB, which will be utilized over\nthree years, and with counterpart contribution by the Government of Sri Lanka. The BSSF will\naccept  contributions  from  other  funding  agencies  and  the  private  sector.  Preliminary  cost\nestimates are Table A7.\n5. BSSF Structure\n14. The BSSF funding will be held in an imprest account with the Ministry of Finance and\nPlanning, the Executing Agency. The BSSF will be managed through the PMU, which will report\nto  the  PSC.  Details  of  the  BSSF  operations  will  be  documented  in  a  memorandum  of\nunderstanding between the EA and the PMU, which will be drafted and executed in a manner\nacceptable to ADB.\n15. BSSF staff will be part of the PMU and will include two technical professionals (one\nexpatriate  and  one  local),  an  office  manager,  and  a  grants  manager.  Other  short-term\nconsultants may be engaged as necessary to support BSSF operations.\n16. The PMU will provide administration support to the BSSF in a manner acceptable to\nADB. Administration will consist of maintaining the books of account, maintaining the bank\naccounts,  evaluating  and  summarizing  proposals  for  consideration,  receiving  income,\nnegotiating contracts, making payments, preparing financial and other operational statements,\netc.\n17. The PMU will monitor the activities of BDS providers contracted to deliver services,  with\nsummary  reports  submitted  to  the  PSC  on  a  quarterly  basis.  Progress  reports  by  the\nparticipating institutions will form part of the contract agreed to by the parties.\n6. Audit\n18. It is proposed that a reputable auditing company, located in Sri Lanka, audit the BSSF\non an annual basis. The major responsibilities of the auditors will include confirmation that the\ninvestments  are  held  in  the  designated  bank  account,  all  income  has  been  received,  all\npayments have been properly authorized and recorded, bank accounts have been verified, and\nfinancial information presented to the subcommittee is accurate.", "Appendix 7, page 6\n65\n7.

Commercial Bank of Ceylon, Ltd.\n \n1. Background\n1. The Commercial Bank of Ceylon (CBC) was established in June 1989 as a public\ncompany and began operations in November of that year, taking over the operations of an\nEastern Bank Ltd. Colombo branch. Headquartered in Colombo, CBC is a full-service bank\nproviding  a  wide  variety  of  commercial  and  consumer  banking  services  in  Colombo  and\nthroughout Sri Lanka. Although CBC has more than 5,000 ordinary and nonvoting shareholders,\nownership control is concentrated in the two largest shareholders. The four largest shareholders\nat end-2000 were DFCC (29.77 percent), Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation (29.72 percent),\nDistilleries Company of Sri Lanka (2.3 percent), and Ceylon Petroleum (1.92 percent). CBC is\nlisted on the Ceylon Stock Exchange (CSE).\n2.  Organization, Management, and Personnel\n2. CBC has a board of directors comprising 8 prominent Sri Lankan bankers and business\npeople,  and  a  strong  group  of  28  corporate  and  senior  bank  managers  having  extensive\nexperience  in  commercial  banking.  CBC  has  been  steadily  developing  a  national  branch\nnetwork, which comprises 87 branches today, up from 39 in 1996.\n3. A  growing  banking  staff  services  the  bank  and  branch  network.  CBC  has  2,067\nemployees, up from 1,837 in 1996, a 12.5 percent increase. Bank executives have increased\nmore sharply from 236 in 1996 to 564 in 2000 (138 percent increase), reflecting the need for\nexperienced management for maintaining profitability during high growth periods. CBC staff\nhave been thoroughly trained in the bank\u2019s extensive bank management and employee training\nprogram to perform their banking duties. Bank training is an ongoing employee obligation and\nthe bank requires a minimum of 60 hours annual training to update or expand the staff\u2019s banking\nknowledge  and  skills.  The  in-house  training  program  is  supplemented  with  local  and\ninternational bank training programs offered by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) and\nprivate bank institutes, as needed, to meet the increasing demands of the jobs.\n4. CBC  has  improved  its  infrastructure  during  the  last  five  years,  installing  Globus\nmanagement information and loan accounting system to fully computerize and automate its\noperations. Gradually, the entire bank operations are linked by computers from the Colombo\nheadquarters to every branch throughout Sri Lanka. Eighty branches have been so linked. The\nbank contends that this improved information technology (IT) system has been a major factor in\nreducing its costs to satisfactory levels.\n3.  Operations\n5. CBC\u2019s business has grown briskly but firmly since 1997. Total assets have risen at a\nbrisk 16-25 percent annually since 1997, going from SLRs25.3 billion in 1996 and reaching a\ntotal of SLRs49.6 billion at end-2000, essentially doubling the size of the bank in five years.\nLoan growth has advanced even more sharply with an annual growth rate of 16-35 percent from\na strong base of SLRs13.4 billion at end-1996 to SLRs31.5 billion by end-2000. The bank has\nfunded this loan growth through an equally growing depository base collected from the public\nthrough the growing branch network. Deposits from customers grew at 19-25 percent annually\nfrom SLRs16.6 billion in 1996 to SLRs37.5 billion at end-2000.", "Appendix 9, page 2\n73\n4.  Financial Performance, Position, and Portfolio Quality\n6. Despite this major growth, the bank has maintained a strong focus on profitability and\nkept costs under control during the growth period. Initially CBC\u2019s operating expenses increased\nstrongly, paralleling asset and portfolio growth. Operating expenses rose from 55 percent of net\nincome  in  1996    to  60  percent  in  1999.  But  the  bank  has  managed  to  reduce  operating\nexpenses, reporting a cost-to-income ratio of 54.75 percent for 2000, about the lowest among\nSri Lankan commercial banks. The bank has managed to produce a strong annual return on\naverage assets, 1.9-2.05 percent except for the brief dip to 1.72 percent in 1999. In 2000, CBC\nreported a pretax profit of SLRs1.1 billion, representing a 42 percent increase over the 1999\npretax profit of SLRs809.4 million. While few years are very profitable, CBC has been profitable\nevery year in the last decade with an average income growth of 20 percent over the previous\nyear.\n7. CBC reported nonperforming loans-to-total loans of 8.73 percent at end-2000.That is\nabove the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) bank supervision level of 7 percent at which time a\nbank  is  put  on  watch  notice.  However,  CBC  lowered  this  nonperforming  loan  portfolio\npercentage from 8.95 percent from the previous year-end. CBC had some increase during the\nquarter from the recent slowdown. It is difficult to tell whether this is a strong trend, or a\ntemporary problem coinciding with recent domestic violence. The year-end financial statements\nwill probably reveal whether a serious problem is developing in CBC\u2019s loan portfolio.\n5.  Capital Adequacy\n8. CBC strives to maintain a strong and well-capitalized bank at all times. It has maintained\na total capital adequacy ratio over 17 percent since 1996, dipping slightly to 16.62 percent in\n2000 (Table A10.1). In addition, equity-to-total assets has remained over 10 percent throughout\nthis period. CBC has managed to increase its capital in 1997 through a public share offering of\nSLRs80 million through the CSE. CBC\u2019s strong balance sheet has enabled the bank to issue\nsenior debt rated by the Fitch Ratings Lanka Ltd as SL AA+, indicating a very low expectation of\ncredit risk.\nB. Hatton National Bank\n1. Background\n9. Hatton National Bank Ltd. (HNB) was established in May 1970 after consolidation of\nHatton Bank and two branches of the National and Grindlays Bank. The Sri Lanka operations of\nMercantile Bank and the Emirates Bank International were acquired in 1974 and 1989. Since\n1990, HNB has been the largest private domestic commercial bank in Sri Lanka in terms of\nassets and deposits.\n10. HNB is more widely held than CBC with no single shareholder holding more than 16\npercent of the bank\u2019s total share capital. The five largest shareholders are Standard Finance Ltd\n(15.69 percent), CBD Exports Ltd (7.68 percent), Milford Exports (Ceylon) Ltd. (7,68 percent),\nStassen Exports Ltd. (6.66 percent), and Panchalingam Associates Ltd (0.551 percent); with the\nremainder widely held by private institutions and individuals. HNB has 3,594 voting and 11,475\nnonvoting shareholders, and its shares are traded on the CSE.", "Appendix 9, page 3\n74\n2.  Organization, Management and Personnel\n11. HNB operates 107 branches throughout Sri Lanka with 4,021 employees as of end-\n2000. This number represents a 45 percent increase from 1996 and mirrors the relatively rapid\ngrowth that HNB experienced in virtually all aspects of its business during the last five years.\nThe strong increase in its branch network has enabled HNB to gather an increasing volume of\ndeposits from the public. HNB has its own in-house bank training program for fully educating all\npersonnel on the best practices in sound banking. The bank\u2019s own program is supplemented\nfrom  time  to  time  with  outside  national  courses  from  the  CBSL  and  private  bank  training\ninstitutes as well as international bank training programs.\n12. HNB also uses the Globus banking software package for information management and\nloan accounting. The bank is in the process of extending computer linkages between bank\nheadquarters and its branches and hopes to have this completed within one year. Then all\nbranch  retail  credit,  trade  finance,  and  treasury  functions  will  be  computer-linked  with  the\nGlobus network.\n3.  Operations\n13. HNB total assets more than doubled during the past five years, from SLRs41.3 billion in\n1996 to SLRs87.6 billion for an average annual asset growth of 22 percent. However, the\ngrowth has been erratic ranging from 37 percent in 1996-1997, but reduced to 8 percent in\n1997-1998. Total loans also rose rapidly from SLRs20.8 billion in 1996 to SLRs46.9 billion in\n2000, but more consistently with an average annual growth rate of 25 percent with fewer\nsignificant swings from year to year from actual annual growth rates. Deposits from customers\nrose as did the loan growth, with a big 34 percent jump from 1996 to 1997, but a 17 percent\nannual growth through 2000. HNB has had a more difficult time controlling costs during this\nstrong growth period. The HNB cost-to-income ratio was 65 percent in 1996 before rising to\n69.8 percent in 1999 and 2000. HNB recognizes the importance of lower administrative cost to\nprofitability and is taking measures, including more effective IT usage, to bring this ratio below\n63 percent.\n4.  Financial Performance, Position, and Portfolio Quality\n14. As expected with rising loans, deposits, and operating costs, profitability has dropped.\nWhile income rose steadily from SLRs4.7 billion at year-end in 1996, to SLRs9.6 billion in 2000\n(Table A9.1), net income rose more slowly and erratically from SLRs453 million in 1996 to\nSLRs800 million in 2000. A closer look at profitability indicators reveals that HNB has had some\ndifficulty in managing its growth. Its rate of return on average assets declined from 1.3 percent\nin 1996 to 1.2 percent in the next two years, and finally settled at 1 percent  in 1999 and 2000.\nHNB recognizes that it must contain costs as it expands its portfolio, depository base, and\nbranch network. Dropping below 1 percent return on average assets is a warning that stronger\nefficiency measures are needed to put the bank\u2019s assets to work more profitably.\n5.  Capital Adequacy, Liquidity, and Equity\n15. HNB\u2019s capital position grew steadily during the past five years through issuance of\nshares to the public and building up of reserves with retained earnings. From a shareholder\nbase of SLRs200 million in 1996, HNB raised its paid-in capital to SLRs650 million or 225\npercent during five years through two share offerings. Total capital grew from SLRs2. 6 billion in\n1996 to SLRs5.5 billion in 2000, an increase of 115 percent. Capital growth has kept pace with", "Appendix 9, page 4\n75\nthe growth in loans and deposits to meet and exceed the CBSL capital adequacy standards.\nCBSL currently requires 9 percent Tier 1 and 2 capital and HNB had 11.02 percent as of end-\n2000.\n16. HNB managed its market and liquidity risk using its Asset/Liability Committee (ALCO)\nand the board of directors to set market risk exposures. The ALCO established the policy\nguidelines that the bank\u2019s treasury operations must follow, with liquidity risk being measured on\na cash-flow basis. CBSL sets a liquidity reserve requirement of 20 percent. In practice, banks\nmust stay above this to avoid even short-term liquidity dips below the standard. At end-2000,\nHNB had a liquid assets-to-liabilities ratio of 25.1 percent and had maintained a ratio of 23\npercent to 27 percent throughout 1996-2000.\n17. HNB has had some difficulty with nonperforming loans. The economic slowdown that\noccurred in 1997 saw an increase in HNB\u2019s nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans\nfrom 7.32 percent in 1997 to 9.32 percent in 1998. HNB has managed to lower that percentage\nsomewhat during the next two years, reducing the nonperforming loans to 9.01 percent by 2000.\nHNB\u2019s experience reflects the typical problem of time and expense taken to keep nonperforming\nloans, once they are categorized as such, from being loans in default. HNB management has\nreported a jump to 12 percent nonperforming loans during 2001. This is a major jump in\nnonperforming assets and the bank is likely to take a long time to work out these assets with\ncollections. This condition will press on the bank\u2019s profitability and its return on average assets.\nThis development should be closely watched and reviewed at year-end to determine whether it\nhas become a significant problem affecting the banks\u2019 long-term profitability, or just a temporary\ncondition.\nC. Sampath Bank\n  1. Background\n18. Sampath Bank Ltd. was incorporated as the Investment and Credit Bank in 1987, with\nan authorized capital of SLRs500 million and paid-up capital of SLRs175 million. Following a\npublic offering in May 1987, it began operations. Sampath is one of the most widely held\ncommercial banks having more than 16,418 shareholders owning more than 33 million shares.\nNo one shareholder owns more than 10 percent of the outstanding shares. The five largest\nshareholders are National Development Bank (NDB, 8.11 percent), HNB (5 percent), Sampath\nAccount no. 2 (5 percent), Distilleries Company of Sri Lanka (5 percent), and Stassen Exports\nLtd. (5 percent).\n  2. Organization, Management, and Personnel\n19. Sampath is managed by a board of directors of nine members with extensive experience\nin banking, business, accounting, law, and academia. It has a corporate management team of 9\nprofessionals and an executive management team of 17 professional bank managers, who with\nthe chief executive officer manage bank operations. Sampath operates through a network of 38\nbranches, which had 1,355 employees in 2000. This is an increase from 26 branches and 981\nemployees in 1996, the beginning of the review period.\n20. Like other commercial banks, Sampath also has an in-house training program through\nwhich it trains all its banking staff through a full range of courses giving them a solid grounding\nin the basic best practices of sound banking. Every employee must take at least 60 hours of", "Appendix 9, page 5\n76\napproved bank training each year. These courses are supplemented with local CBSL and\nprivate banking institute courses and seminars as well as with some international programs.\n21. Sampath has focused on IT systems from its early organization in an effort to maximize\noperational efficiency. It also uses its IT systems as a management tool to have updated and\naccurate information on the quality and performance of its loan portfolio, investments, and other\nassets.\n  3. Operations\n22. Like other commercial banks, Sampath\u2019s total assets have more than doubled during the\npast five years going from SLRs14.9 billion in 1996 to SLRs34.6 billion, with an annual asset\ngrowth ranging from 20 to 26 percent. Total loans also rose rapidly from SLRs9.6 billion in 1996\nto SLRs46.9 billion in 2000, but more consistently with an average annual growth rate of 25\npercent  with  fewer  significant  swings  from  year  to  year  from  actual  annual  growth  rates.\nDeposits from customers rose substantially from SLRs9.6 billion in 1996 to SLRs24.7 billion in\n2000, with annual deposit growth ranging from 20 percent to 33 percent.\n23. Sampath has difficulty in controlling costs during its growth period. From the beginning\nSampath has tried be modern and innovative, introducing new products and services into the Sri\nLanka banking sector. In its early years, Sampath made great strides in reducing cost, bringing\nits high 70.4 percent operating expense-to-income ratio in 1991 down to 49.2 percent in 1995.\nHowever, this was reversed as the same ratio moved from 53.2 percent in 1996 to 65 percent\nby 1999. In the year 2000, Sampath started another cost reduction trend, bringing its cost-to-\nincome ratio down to 63 percent. However, its rising nonperforming loans are likely to make it\ndifficult to achieve further progress in bringing down administrative costs.\n  4. Financial Performance, Position, and Portfolio Quality\n24. Sampath\u2019s income rose during the loan and asset growth period, though at a lower\npercentage. Income for end-1996 stood at SLRs1.9 billion growing to SLRs4.2 billion by 2000\n(Table A10.1). The year-to-year change in income rose from 13 percent to about 35 percent,\nwith an average growth of 21 percent.\n25. Sampath  has  also  had  difficulty  in  maintaining  strong  profitability  primarily  due  to\nincreasing operating expenses. Sampath experienced a strong 2.1 return on average assets\nduring 1996, but that ratio steadily declined from 1.9 in 1997, to 1.8 in 1998 to 1.2 in 1999.\nSampath has managed to increase its return on assets slightly to 1.3, perhaps stemming the\ntide in the recent downward trend. However, its increasing nonperforming loans will test whether\nSampath  succeeds  in  further  lowering  operating  costs.  Sampath\u2019s  focus  on  technology  is\ncommendable in view of how other banks have been adopting this technology more slowly.\nHowever, IT must be used to lower overall costs and generate efficiencies if profitability is to be\nincreased. This is particularly important in SME lending where administrative costs in extending\nand monitoring loans are high and costs in working out nonperforming loans are higher.\n26. If the rising level of nonperforming loans causes the return on average assets to drop\nbelow 1 percent, that will be a warning that more efficiency measures must be taken to put the\nbank\u2019s assets to work more profitably.", "Appendix 9, page 6\n77\n  5. Capital Adequacy and Liquidity\n27. From its early organization, Sampath has tried to maintain a strong capital base for its\nbanking operations. From a shareholder base of SLRs354.3 million, it has continued to build\ncapital to support its growth through retained earnings and a share offering in 1999. Total capital\ngrew from SLRs1.2 billion in 1996 to SLRs2.3 billion in 2000, a 91 percent increase for the\nperiod.  Capital growth has kept pace with the growth in loans and deposits to meet and exceed\nthe CBSL capital adequacy standards. CBSL currently requires a 9 percent Tier 1 and 2 capital\nadequacy ratio. During 1996-2000, Sampath maintained a Tier I and II capital adequacy ratio\nbetween 12 percent and 14 percent. Having done that, Sampath\u2019s capital adequacy percentage\ndropped from 14 percent to about 12 percent at end-2000. This could be a cause for concern if\nthe trend continues. The existence of rising nonperforming loans approaching 15 percent is\nfurther reason for a cautious and careful review of Sampath\u2019s 2001 annual financial statements\nafter year-end.\n28. The CBSL liquidity reserve requirement is 20 percent. In practice, banks must stay\nabove this to avoid even short-term liquidity dips below this standard. Sampath has maintained\na liquidity ratio very close to the CBSL limit. At end-1999, Sampath\u2019s ratio of liquid assets to\nliabilities stood at 20.27 percent. By end-2000, Sampath\u2019s liquidity ratio had risen to 21.16\npercent.\n29. Sampath has also had some difficulty with nonperforming loans. Its nonperforming loans\nrose following the 1997 economic slowdown, with the nonperforming loan percentage of the\ntotal loan portfolio of 7.6 percent going to 10.8 by end-1998. Along with rapid growth in its loan\nportfolio came additional bad loans. During 1999, Sampath\u2019s nonperforming loans grew even\nhigher to 17.1 percent. Sampath managed to bring the rate down to 12.9 percent by end- 2000,\nbut it recently crept up again to 14.7 percent. A more detailed review of the type and quality of\nloans that are showing up in the nonperforming category may shed some light on new strategies\nfor improving the bank\u2019s performance. It may be that its aggressive bank pioneering strategies\ninto new products and services has also brought Sampath in contact with many new customers\nthat  have  not  previously  had  bank  loans.  Some  loans  to  new  borrowers,  if  not  carefully\nmanaged and aggressively collected immediately upon default of payment, gradually become\nloss loans. The key is having the proper credit criteria in analyzing the loans prior to approval\nand an early warning system that gives the first signs of problems.\n30. Sampath is well aware of the nonperforming loan problem and has provisioned general\nand  specific  reserves  against  loss.  At  end-2000,  Sampath  had  a  loan  loss  provision  that\ncovered 31 percent of its nonperforming loan portfolio. Nevertheless, the recent upsurge in\nmore  nonperforming  loans  suggests  a  review  of  this  problem  at  year-end  to  assess  its\ntemporary or long-term nature. Sampath\u2019s five-year performance suggests that workout of these\nnonperforming loans may take some time and will continue to be pressing down on Sampath\u2019s\nprofitability.\nD. National Development Bank\n  1. Background\n31. The National Development Bank (NDB) was established as a wholly state owned special\nfinancial institution by an Act of Parliament in 1979. The Government offered 61 percent of its\ncapital to the public for sale in February 1993 and to institutional investors in accordance with\nprivatization  of  the  government\u2019s  controlling  interest.  The  Government  further  reduced  its", "Appendix 9, page 7\n78\nownership  interest  in  1997  to  12.2  percent  through  a  convertible  debentures  offering.  An\nadditional 2.56 percent of the Government\u2019s share was transferred to the employee share option\nscheme. NDB is now widely held by approximately 7,000 shareholders and its approximately 54\nmillion shares are traded on the CSE. The five largest shareholders include the Government\n(Secretary to the Treasury) (7.33 percent), BSDT\u2014Investors Pacific International Fund (6.84\npercent), Bank of Ceylon (6.11 percent), CBSL (4.88 percent), and Hong Kong Shanghai Bank\nCorporation  Int\u2019l  Nominees  (3.71  percent).  NDB  is  regulated  by  CBSL.  CBSL\u2019s  continued\nownership interest, probably a vestige of NDB\u2019s state-owned status, would appear to be a\nconflict of interest between NDB and its regulator.\n32. NDB continues to operate under its enabling statute as a public development institution.\nDue to a recent purchase of ABN-AMRO Bank (Sri Lanka) changed to NDB, NDB has long-term\nplans to merge with the NDB Bank and become a universal commercial bank. This process will\nrequire amending its statute to permit the merger and regulatory approval. NDB has been\npursuing a strategy for becoming a dominant provider of a whole range of financial products and\nservices to its customers, including those offered by commercial banks. A group identified with\nNDB will be supported through a common IT platform and administration. Consolidation with\nNDB is one step in NDB\u2019s long-term strategy.\n  2. Organization, Management, and Personnel\n33. NDB is managed by a board of directors of 11 members comprising of experienced\nnational  and  international  business  people,  financiers,  and  bankers.  The  ADB  resident\nrepresentative in Sri Lanka, Mr. Cooney, sits on the NDB board. The NDB managing director\nand chief executive officer is also an ex officio nonvoting board member.\n34. NDB  has  historically  been  staffed  with  a  high  percentage  of  highly  trained\nprofessionals\u2014engineers, Masters of Business Administration graduates, economists, lawyers,\nand accountants to give hands-on project finance team management to the majority of its past\nlending activities. The total staff increased from 223 in 1996 to 376 in 2000 a 67 percent\nincrease during the period. In addition to project finance, NDB is involved in a number of related\nfinancial areas, including merchant banking (share underwriting, loan syndication, diagnostic\nand feasibility studies, and financial advisory services), equipment leasing and finance, and\nworking capital finance.\n35. Like the commercial banks, NDB trains its staff in-house in all areas of bank operations\nand procedures. NDB employee training is also supplemented with participation in courses and\nseminars conducted by CBSL and private banking institutes.\n36. NDB purchased software and hardware for a comprehensive IT system to modernize IT\nacross the NDB group. By year-end, NDB and its 11-branch network will be fully automated and\ncomputer-linked to enable information flow throughout the group.\n3. Operations\n37. Like the commercial banks, NDB also experienced high growth in total assets during\n1996-2000, except in the last year. NDB\u2019s total assets have not quite doubled but increased 92\npercent during the past five years from SLRs19.9 billion in 1996 to SLRs38.3 billion, with an\nannual asset growth range of 19-32 percent for the first four years. Total assets grew by only\n2.9 percent from 1999 to 2000, reflecting the very modest increase in total loans that year. Total\nloans and advances also rose rapidly during the period except for the flatness in 2000: from", "Appendix 9, page 8\n79\nSLRs14.7 billion in 1996 doubling to almost SLRs28.5 billion in 1999 before turning flat with a\n14 percent increase in 2000 with SLRs28.59 billion total loans and advances. The decline in\ndemand was reflected in the drop in loan approvals in both 1999 and 2000. Loan approvals in\n1999 dropped 34 percent from 1998 and a steeper decline of 38 percent occurred in 2000.\nManagement explains this as related to the bank\u2019s effort to regularize some short-term facilities\nand its desire to curtail new lending in short-term instruments.\n38. NDB is not a deposit-taking institution but has been funded by a series of long-term\ncredit facilities from the Government and multilateral banks. It is a private enterprise, resulting\nfrom the Government\u2019s privatizating all but less than 10 percent of its ownership interest. NDB is\nresponding to the challenge to obtain alternative funding sources and trying to more efficiently\nmanage its current resources to obtain greater profitability.\n  4. Financial Performance, Position, and Portfolio Quality\n39. NDB\u2019s income rose along with the asset and loan growth of 1996-2000, increasing\nannually at 12-23 percent. Income for end-1998 stood at SLRs2.8 billion growing to SLRs5.2\nbillion by 2000. Profitability has been more illusive for NDB. Profit rose from SLRs707 million in\n1996 to SLRs774 million in 1998, only to decline (4.5 percent) to SLRs739 million in 1999 and\nfurther decline (29 percent) to SLRs519 million in 2000. The NDB decline in profitability during\nthe five-year period is more clearly illustrated  by its declining return on average assets, which\nwent from 3.4 percent in 1996 steadily downward each year\u20143.1 percent in 1997, 2.8 percent\nin 1998, 2.2 percent in 1999, and finally to 1.4 percent in 2000. This steady decline reflects\nNDB\u2019s change in status to a private enterprise. The signals are clear that it must turn its\nprofitability decline around quickly or its ability to continue to operate as a going concern may be\nin jeopardy.\n40. NDB must quickly find alternative funding sources for its projects. It is not clear that\nentering the retail commercial banking world to gather deposits is necessarily the answer.\nThough deposit mobilization has experienced rapid growth during the last five years, it is not\nclear that there are sufficient additional funds from the population that are not already housed in\none or more of the depository gathering institutions. Bidding away deposits from other financial\ninstitutions can be expensive, particularly when NDB is behind in developing a branch network.\n41. More importantly, NDB must resolve its declining loan approvals that have been the\nmainstay of its business. If that business cannot be revived, alternative intermediation or fee-\nearning opportunities must be developed and quickly. Should NDB\u2019s profitability continue to\ndecline, it will become increasingly more difficult for the bank to reverse the trend.\n  5. Capital Adequacy, Liquidity, and Equity\n42. NDB was initially strongly capitalized from government sources and continued to have\nample capital to support its services during its early stages through privatization. From the initial\ncapital of SLRs175 million, NDB increased its capital to SLRs358 million in 1997 through\nconvertible debentures. A further share offering in 2000 raised NDB\u2019s paid-in capital to SLRs538\nmillion (Table A9.2). From this shareholder base, NDB has developed the bulk of its capital\nresources to support its loan and asset growth through retained earnings. Total capital has\ngrown from SLRs4.1 billion in 1996 to SLRs5.78 billion in 2000, or a 41 percent increase for the\nperiod. Throughout the period, NDB reported a strong capital adequacy position, more than\nmeeting the CBSL capital adequacy standards. During 1996-2000, NDB maintained a Tier I and\nII capital adequacy ratio between 21 period and 13 period, substantially above the CBSL", "Appendix 9, page 9\n80\nstandard. The downward trend is somewhat problematic and needs serious attention. The\ndecline simply confirms the other downward trends in NDB\u2019s business that must be addressed\nbefore capital levels go substantially lower and more difficult to correct.\n43. NDB also has substantial nonperforming loans during the past two years. Although the\npercentage of nonperforming loans is declining, it is still high and must be redressed soon in\nface of the bank\u2019s generally declining profitability trend. More information on the amount and\ncharacter of the nonperforming loans at year-end is needed to determine whether there is\nfurther deterioration in the bank\u2019s portfolio or condition.\nE. DFCC BANK\n1.  Background\n44. DFCC was established by an Act of Parliament in 1955 as a public limited-liability\ncompany to provide financial assistance principally to the private industry and service sectors of\nSri  Lanka.  Operations  began  in  May  1956.  Through  the  Bank  of  Ceylon  and  Sri  Lanka\nInsurance Corporation\u2014Life Fund, the Government owns 17.65 percent of DFCC, with the\nremainder held by the public and institutional investors with a total of 7,419 shareholders. The\nfive largest DFCC shareholders are Bank of Ceylon (15 percent), HNB (9.15 percent), DEG\n(7.84 percent), Readywear Industries Ltd. (7.62 percent), and Boston Safe Deposit Trust\u2014\nInvestor Global Fund (6.09 percent).\n45. DFCC  continues  to  operate  under  its  enabling  statute  as  a  public  development\ninstitution. It has been in discussing with CBC a potential consolidation or merger to enable the\nbroadening of DFCC/CBC into a universal bank. DFCC owns just under 30 percent of CBC.\nCBSL Bank Supervision estimated that this process will require amending its statute to permit\nthe merger and regulatory approval.\n2. Organization, Management, and Personnel\n46. DFCC is managed under the direction of a board of director comprising 10 members,\nresponsible for formulating policies and procedures under which the chief executive officer and\nan executive management team of 52 professional managers conduct the bank\u2019s operations.\nThe DFCC chief executive officer is also an ex officio nonvoting board member.\n47. DFCC has a network of eight branches throughout Sri Lanka through which regional\noperations are conducted.\n3. Operations\n48. Like the other banks, DFCC also experienced high growth in total assets during the\nperiod  1997-2001.1  DFCC\u2019s  total  assets  have  not  grown  as  rapidly  as  those  of  the  other\ninstitutions, however, but increased 69 percent during the past five years, from SLRs17.0 billion\nin 1997 to SLRs25.9 billion in 2001. The growth was erratic-11 percent to 32 percent until 1999\nand then remaining essentially flat through 2001. This may reflect the changing in role of\ndevelopment finance institutions from public institutions to private enterprises. Total loans and\nadvances also rose, but not as rapidly as those of other institutions. DFCC\u2018s loan portfolio grew\n                                            \n1  The review period is slightly different due to DFCC\u2019s fiscal year.", "Appendix 9, page 10\n81\nfrom SLRs9 billion in 1997 to almost double, with a 93 percent increase to SLRs17.4 billion in\n2001.\n49. DFCC, like NDB, is not a deposit-taking institution, but was funded by a series of long-\nterm  credit  facilities  from  the  Government  and  multilateral  banks.  Recently,  DFCC  has\nexperienced rising interest rates on its debt obligations, but is unable to raise its loan rates by\nthe same amount. Its net interest rate margin is tightening and putting downward pressure on\nearnings.\n4.  Financial Performance, Position, and Portfolio Quality\n50. DFCC\u2019s income performance has been erratic, rising in 1997 from the previous year by a\nmodest 6.4 percent and again rising in 1998 by 15 percent. Income rose slowly by 7 percent in\n1999 but experienced a larger rise of 17% in 2000 before dropping to 0 percent in 2001. Profit\nwas equally erratic. Experiencing a profit curve similar to that of NDB, DFCC saw its profit rise\nfrom SLRs416 million in 1997 to SLRs672 million in 1999, only to decline to SLRs530 million in\n2000 and further decline (29 percent) to SLRs519 million in 2001.\n51. Though DFCC has not reported its multiyear volume of nonperforming loans, it said that\nthey were 22 percent of the loan portfolio in 2000 and were down from the previous year. This is\na very high volume of nonperforming loans, but is not unusual for a government development\nfinance company. The difficulty is that DFCC has become a public company and subject to\nfierce competition from the private sector. Historically, DFCC has taken the policy position of\ntrying to work with a project until there are no options but to foreclose and liquidate. This\nexplains, according to management, the long time that nonperforming loans remain on the\nDFCC books before liquidation. DFCC may have to revisit this policy if it is going to improve its\nprofitability, given the erratic trends of the past five years. DFCC has a strong capital position\nand time to review and reconsider its policies and strategies. In any event, nonperforming loans\nat 22 percent are too much of a drag on profitability and should be resolved.\n5.  Capital Adequacy, Liquidity, and Equity\n52. DFCC reports a small but steady capital growth throughout the review period. Total\ncapital rose 16 percent from 1997 to 1998 but only 7-8 percent annually for the remainder of the\nperiod.  Importantly,  DFCC  has  maintained  a  strong  capital  structure  and  these  modest\nincreases still enable DFCC to have a capital adequacy ratio exceeding 25 percent for 2000 and\n2001.\n53. On a longer term, DFCC just like NDB, must focus on its profitability. However, the\npicture is not so bleak. DFCC reports return on average assets from 2.6 percent in 1997 up to\n3.3 percent in 1998 only to see a decline in the following two years. DFCC recovered in 2001,\nimproving profitability to 2.5 percent. DFCC appears to be very focused on its profitability picture\nand the necessary reductions in both interest expense and operating expense to maintain its\nbusiness and increase profitability.", "Attachment A9.1: Summary Performance of Selected Commercial Banks in Sri Lanka\nItem Commercial Bank of Ceylon Hatton National Bank Sampath Bank\n1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000\n1 Return on Average 1.90 2.05 1.90 1.72 2.05 1.30 1.20 1.20 1.00 1.00 2.10 1.90 1.80 1.20 1.30\nAssets (%)\n2 Return on 17.03 16.80 16.20 16.21 20.09 19.00 20.00 21.00 17.00 15.00 26.70 24.70 23.30 13.90 18.90\nShareholder Fund\n(%)\n3 Income Growth (%) 23.40 15.71 5.24 19.25 28.49 34.00 28.00 10.00 15.00 25.00 17.50 22.50 13.90 17.10 34.60\n4 Profit Growth (%) 32.00 25.00 9.00 11.00 42.00 -6.00 22.00 23.00 5.00 6.00 17.00 14.00 16.00 -30.00 53.78\n5 Earnings Per Share 18.00 16.00 17.00 19.00 27.00 9.06 11.06 13.14 13.95 12.31 6.37 7.26 8.39 5.90 9.10\n(SLRs)\n6 Capital Adequacy 17.13 16.71 15.53 14.90 14.97 7.95 7.66 8.24 10.08 10.13 12.9 11.3 11.4 10.5 9.57\nTier 1 (%)\n7 Capital Adequacy 17.47 17.63 18.45 17.14 16.62 8.84 8.38 11.39 11.83 11.02 14.3 12.4 12.5 14.0 12.09\nTiers 1&2 (%)\n8 Liquid Assets-to- 28.17 25.36 24.97 22.19 27.22 23.00 23.00 27.00 25.00 25.00 - - - 20.27 21.16\nLiability Ratio (%)\n9 Equity/Total Assets 11.96 12.36 11.18 10.18 10.17 6.25 5.33 5.79 6.55 6.30 7.84 7.81 7.76 7.19 6.61\n(%)\n8\n10 Nonperforming - - 11.40 8.95 8.73 - - - 9.12 9.01 - 7.6 10.8 17.1 12.90 2\nPortfolio (%)\n11 Advances to 92 89 80 90 91 69 70 72 73 73 - - - - 93\nDeposits +\nRefinance (%)\n12 Market Value Per 124 150 120 115 93 260 225 174 87 46 46.00 62.00 49.25 45.00 41.50\nShare (SLRs)\n13 Net Assets Per 113.00 128.00 111.00 123.00 145.00 129.00 151.00 118.00 77.00 85.00 26.39 32.47 39.66 44.40 51.70\nShare (SLRs)\n14 Total Assets (SLRs 25,335 27,659 34,586 41,887 49,611 41,382 56,509 61,073 76,354 87,656 14,900 18,412 22,640 27,326 34,596\nmn)\n15 Loans and 13,414 15,690 18,312 24,692 31,570 20,830 28,343 33,988 39,885 46,904 9,577 12,910 16,815 20,776 26,645\nAdvances (SLRs\nmn)\n16 Paid-Up Capital 268 268 348 348 348 200 200 300 650 650 354 354 354 443 443\n(SLRs mn)\n17 Total Shareholder 3,032 3,421 3,867 4,268 5,048 2,587 3,014 3,537 5,008 5,548 1,169 1,438 1,756 1,965 2,289 A\np\nFunds (SLRs mn) p\n18 Dividend Rate (%) 30.00 40.00 40 40 45.00 40.00 50.00 45.00 40.00 40.00 15.00 15.00 15.00 40.00 17.50 e\nn\n19 Income (SLRs mn) 3,365 3,781 3,979 4,744 6,096 4,792 6,116 6,704 7,723 9,641 1,917 2,348 2,675 3,135 4,220 d\nix\n20 Profit Before Tax 580 653 769 809 1,150 1573 725 858 894 949 406 449 487 342 535  \n9\n(SLRs mn) ,\n \np\na\ng\ne\n \n1\n1", "Attachment A9.2: Summary Performance of Selected Development Banks in Sri Lanka\nItem NDB DFCC - as of March\n1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001\n1 Return on Average Assets (%) 3.4 3.1 2.8 2.2 1.4 2.6 3.3 3.0 2.1 2.5\n2 Return on Shareholder Fund (%) 16.1 16.6 16.5 13.2 9.5 11.0 14.0 14.2 10.4 11.5\n3 Income Growth (%) 14 25 14 13 20 6.4 15 7 17 0\n4 Profit Growth (%) 0 32 9 -12 34 -14 42 13 -21 19\n5 Earnings Per Share (SLRs) 11.50 13.50 14.90 13.30 10.20 11.80 16.81 19.06 15.02 17.87\n6 Capital Adequacy Tier 1 (%) 20.96 20.82 16.46 14.10 14.61 - - - 25.4 25.1\n7 Capital Adequacy Tiers 1&2 (%) 21.04 19.39 14.40 13.30 13.02 - - - 25.4 25.3\n8 Liquid Assets-to-Liability Ratio (%) - - - - 27.78 - - - - -\n9 Equity/Total Assets (%) 21.10 17.88 17.16 15.84 15.60 23.04 23.91 19.22 22.38 21.67\n10 Nonperforming Portfolio (%) - 10.61 8.80 13.30 10.40 - - - 20.9 19.2\n11 Advances to Deposits + Refinance - - - - 18 - - - 22 24\n(%)\n12 Market Value Per Share (SLRs) 195.00 229.75 128.00 115.00 42.00 249.75 253.00 107.00 95.00 75.00\n13 Net Assets Per Share (SLRs) 76.29 85.42 96.02 104.78 110.50 - - - 150.68 160.01\n14 Total Assets (SLRs mn) 20,150 26,581 31,823 37,606 42,254 17,021 18,995 25,234 24,070 25,907\n8\n15 Loans and Advances (SLRs mn) 14,735 17,044 23,749 28,692 29,514 10,446 11,807 14,734 15,722 17,406 3\n16 Paid-Up Capital (SLRs mn) 175 358 358 358 538 - - - 353 353\n17 Total Shareholder Funds (SLRs mn) 4,251 4,755 5,464 5,957 6,593 3,922 4,542 4,850 5,272 5,615\n18 Dividend Rate (%) 55 65 65 45 45 35 35 40 40 45\n19 Income (SLRs mn) 2,861 3,566 4,053 4,600 5,512 2,411 2,762 2,949 3,446 3,452\n20 Profit Before Tax (SLRs mn) 915 1,059 1,046 978 838 622 942 913 733 820\nDFCC = Development Finance Corporation of Ceylon, NDB = National Development Bank of Sri Lanka.\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nix\n \n9\n,\n \np\na\ng\ne\n \n1\n2", "Appendix 10, page 1\n84\nTHE COMMERCIAL COFINANCING AND PARTIAL CREDIT GUARANTEE\nA.

While Sri Lanka suffers from an acute absence of relevant data sources, poverty or\nsocioeconomic impact assessments are difficult to make even under normal circumstance as\nthe level of detail required in the data is expensive to create and collect. This latter factor has\nsharply constrained the value of impact assessments globally, and has been recognized as\nsuch by the International Financial Institutions Working Group on SMEs. The Small and Medium\nEnterprise  Sector  Development  Program  (SMESDP)  addresses  this  issue  by  building  in  a\ncomprehensive set of socioeconomic indicators to be collected in a computerized format by\nPCIs at subloan approval stage.  This will provide a unique basis for carrying out post evaluation\nof the project\u2019s impact.\nA. Estimate of Job Creation\n2. The coefficient of 553 jobs per $1 million of loans estimated from earlier SME projects\nfinanced by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in Sri Lanka was adjusted downward by 20\npercent to reflect the higher loan size under SMESDP to obtain an estimate of 447 jobs per $1\nmillion of loans (rounded to 450 jobs). Since the project proposes to disburse altogether $150\nmillion in credit assistance, the estimated total new employment created is about 62,000.\n3. This estimate should, however, be treated as a gross estimate. A separate World Bank\nassessment of its projects in Sri Lanka found that nearly 40 percent of the borrowers go out of\nbusiness  within  eight  years  of  receiving  loans  (consistent  with  figures  from  developed\neconomies). To that extent, a part of the new job creation is temporary in nature. By applying\nthe figure of 40 percent as the extent of temporary job creation, the net employment generated\nunder SMESDP is predicted to be 40,000.\nB. The Impact of SME Development on Open Unemployment\n4. In view of the capacity of SMEs to create jobs at a relatively low cost, any program of\nSME development would be expected to help relieve the unemployment problem under normal\ncircumstances. In Sri Lanka, however, the factors that tend to render the rate of unemployment\nhigh and resilient are also the factors that are likely to dampen the unemployment-reducing\neffect of job creation through SMEs.\n5. Unemployment is high because a large number of educated young people search for\njobs over an extended time, waiting for \u201cappropriate\u201d jobs. These people tend to seek salaried\n\u201csecure  jobs,\u201d  primarily  in  the  public  sector.  It  is  unlikely  that  large  numbers  of  these\nunemployed will want to be become entrepreneurs, at least initially. This is not to say that\neducated people do not become SME entrepreneurs or that the SME entrepreneurs are not\neducated. As many as 85 percent of SME entrepreneurs have at least high school education.\nHowever, the majority of entrepreneurs (78 percent) came from families that had a business\nbackground. These findings suggest that, generally speaking, educated young people are more\nlikely to set up SMEs if there is a family tradition of doing so.\n6. While  there  is  still  stress  on  secure  public  sector  jobs  among  the  educated,  an\nexamination of the Sri Lankan experience during the postliberalization period suggests that a\ncultural change has already begun\u2014educated young people are beginning to set up their own\nsmall businesses. The components of the proposed SME project that seek to promote market\ndevelopment by providing business development service (BDS) and information technology (IT)", "88 Appendix 11, page 2\nservices will stimulate this process of transformation. Not only will the educated youth be drawn\nto entrepreneurial activities by the presence of efficient service providers, they will also be\nincreasingly absorbed in the service-providing establishments themselves.\n7. The process of cultural change is likely to be slow. With the declining importance of the\npublic sector in the Sri Lankan economy, this sector\u2019s share in total employment came down\nsharply over the 1990s. However, the loss of public sector employees has been offset almost\nentirely by the gain of privates sector employees\u2014with very little change in the proportion of\nself-employed people (Table A11.1). People have swapped the security of white-collar public\nsector jobs with the security of white-collar private sector jobs.\nTable A11.1: The Structure of Employment in Sri Lanka\nby Employment Status; 1990-2000\nYear Public Sector Private Sector Employers Self- Unpaid All\nEmployees Employees Employed Family\nWorkers\n1990 21.5 33.7 1.8 29.2 13.8 100\n1991 22.9 39.5 2.2 25.4 10.0 100\n1992 20.0 40.0 1.6 27.1 11.2 100\n1993 17.4 42.8 2.0 27.4 10.4 100\n1994 16.4 44.3 2.3 27.2 9.8 100\n1995 15.6 44.3 2.5 28.3 9.4 100\n1996 15.0 45.8 2.3 26.8 10.0 100\n1997 15.1 44.3 2.3 28.8 9.4 100\n1998 14.5 41.2 1.9 28.9 13.6 100\n1999 14.4 43.1 2.0 28.3 12.2 100\n2000 13.6 43.2 2.3 27.6 13.3 100\n    Source: Central Bank of Sri Lanka, 2000, Table 7.4, p.126.\n8. In  addition  to  some  reduction  in  open  unemployment,  considerable  job  creation  is\nexpected for those already engaged in \u2018low-income activities\u2019 in other sectors. There is evidence\nthat  young  people  who  traditionally  worked  in  low-wage  estate  or  agriculture  sectors  are\nincreasingly eager to work in the factory sector. In other words, the impact is more likely to be\nfelt on underemployment and disguised unemployment.\nC. The Gender Dimension of Poverty\n9. Substantial  evidence  indicates  the  absence  of  any  serious  gender  discrimination  in\nintrahousehold allocation of resources. To the extent that the treatment of female children is\nindicative of the treatment of women in general, it is reasonable to conclude that gender\ndiscrimination in the allocation of household resources is not a serious problem in Sri Lanka.\nAccordingly, there is no reason to suspect that female poverty is more serious than male\npoverty within the same household.\n10. However, while Sri Lanka has one of the highest gender development index (GDI) in the\ndeveloping world, its gender empowerment index (GEM) is slightly lower than the average for\ndeveloping countries. In 1994, for instance, Sri Lanka\u2019s GDI was 69 percent compared with 55\npercent for the developing world as a whole, while GEM was 31 percent against the developing\nworld average of 37 percent. The low share of earned income is one of the factors, but not only\none, that keeps GEM low. It also contributes to keeping GDI well below the parity figure of 100\npercent, because the share of earned income is a component of GDI as well. In terms of other\ncomponents of GDI \u2013viz. health and education\u2014Sri Lanka has already achieved near parity. It", "Appendix 11, page 3\n89\nis only the component of earned income share that prevents achievement of full gender equality\nin human development.\n11. Therefore, any contribution that the SME sector can make to create income-earning\nopportunities for women will help achieve gender parity in both development and empowerment.\nIf the sector can also absorb more women in administrative/managerial and technical positions,\nthat will also help in improving their empowerment as measured by the GEM index.\n12. Females are not disadvantaged compared with men in terms of poverty or generally in\nterms  of  human  deprivation,  but  they  are  clearly  disadvantaged  in  terms  of  employment\nprospects. It is in this background that the probable gender impact of the proposed SME\ndevelopment project must be analyzed. The relevant issue then is not so much how the Project\naffects women\u2019s poverty, but rather how it will address women\u2019s disadvantage in the sphere of\nemployment.\n13. Evidence from the labor force surveys shows that it is the young adult females in the age\ngroup of 15-30 years that are most severely afflicted by the problem of unemployment. These\nare mostly women with high school education. Table A11.2 shows that rates of unemployment\nare highest among those with education levels of 9-10 years of schooling to the A-levels. It is\nthis group of young educated women who will have to be absorbed if the SME sector is to make\nany  significant  contribution  in  addressing  the  problem  of  female  disadvantage  in  the\nemployment sphere.\n14. Unemployed women with high school education should constitute a rich pool of potential\nentrepreneurs in the small and medium-scale sector. But in reality, women entrepreneurs are\nseriously underrepresented in the SME sector. A recent study found that from 1979 to 1995,\nonly 1 percent of the beneficiary firms and 5 percent of nonbeneficiary firms under ADB-World\nBank financed credit lines had women entrepreneurs. These figures are in sharp contrast with\nthe fact that women represent as much as 18 percent of the self-employed labor force in the\ncountry.\nTable A11.2: Female Unemployment by Education Level, 1995\nEducation Level Rate of Unemployment\nNo School 3.28\n1-5 Years 7.64\n6-8 Year 14.12\n9-10 Years 28.18\nO/Level1 28.53\nA/Level2 32.44\nDegree 3.68\nPostgraduate 8.33\nAll 21.64\nSource: World Bank.\n15. A more recent survey, carried out during the preparatory stage of the proposed SME\ndevelopment program, indicates a considerably higher representation of female entrepreneurs\nin the small and medium industry sector \u2013 nearly 13 percent. The same study also shows that\nwhile the proportion of women and men who used long-term loans was similar, women\u2019s loans\nwere much smaller. On average, the loans taken by women entrepreneurs were just above half\n                                                          \n1 High School diploma normally taken at age 16.\n2  High School diploma normally taken at age 18.", "Appendix 11, page 4\n90\nthe size of loans taken by men \u2013 SLRs.3.0 million for women, SLRs.5.7 million for men. While\nthe evidence is not conclusive, it suggests that previous lines of credit did not attract as many\nwomen entrepreneurs as they could have.\n16. Women will benefit from SME development, not only as entrepreneurs but also as paid\nworkers. Table A11.3 shows the gender distribution of employment by size of industry in 1996.\nWomen account for two thirds of the workforce in medium and large-scale industries, but only\none third in small industries.\nTable A11.3: Gender Distribution of Employment, by Size of Industry; 1996\n(%)\nGender Small Medium Large\nMale 64.5 35.4 38.1\nFemale 33.5 64.6 61.9\nAll 100 100 100\nSource: Department of Census and Statistics, unpublished data.\n17. These figures suggest that while the smaller end of the SME spectrum may not prove to\nbe a major source of paid employment for women, the upper end of the spectrum might be. In\nthis regard, the gains made by women are likely to be the greater, as larger SMEs offer both\nhigher wages and greater security of employment as they have a lower \u201cfailure\u201d rate than\nsmaller SMEs.   In addition, women will also benefit as unpaid family workers of SMEs that are\nrun as family enterprises.\n18. This  will  not  significantly  ameliorate  the  problem  of  open  unemployment  among\neducated young females because, for reasons discussed earlier, they would not generally\naccept blue-collar jobs. But women with less education (primary level or less), who do not\nnormally remain unemployed but tend to work in low-income activities, should have no such\ninhibitions. As a result, the SME project should be able to help alleviate the problems of\nunderemployment and disguised unemployment among women, in much the same way as in\nthe case of men.  In other words, the proposed project is likely to be characterized by gender\nneutrality  in  its  positive  impact  on  the  problems  of  underemployment  and  disguised\nunemployment in Sri Lanka.\n19. One way in which the project is likely to have a bigger impact on women than men is\nthrough migratory flows, which may mitigate to some extent the effect of the likely concentration\nof SME activities in Western Province. Through these flows, the poor of outlying districts and\nprovinces will share in the beneficial effect of the SME project even if the immediate impact\nhappens to be concentrated in a few districts. Women tend to benefit more than men from this\nprocess. An analysis of the socioeconomic profiles of migrants, based on the 1994 Labour\nForce Survey, shows that the sex ratio (male-to-female) is lower among migrants than among\nnon-migrants residing in the districts of Colombo and Gampaha, the two most commercialized\nand industrialized districts of the country. This indicates that females migrate more than men in\nsearch of employment, and as such should benefit proportionately more from the creation of\nemployment opportunities in industry sector in general and the SME sector in particular.\n20. The reform of the legal system under the project to enable potential borrowers to offer\nmovable property (including work-in-progress, collectibles, etc.) as collateral is likely to benefit\nwomen proportionately more, also. This would help women borrowers in particular, as they are\nespecially disadvantaged in their access to immovable property. But they would need further\nassistance if they are to break away from the traditional gender stereotyping of occupations.", "Appendix 11, page 5\n91\nTABLE A11.4: Poverty Impact Assessment of the SME Development Project\nChannel Type of Effect\nShort-Term Long-Term Non-Poor\nLabor Market \u2022  Small reduction in \u2022  Reduced overall Moderate increase in\nunemployment among unemployment, especially demand for skilled labor\neducated, long-term among unskilled and semi-\nunemployed skilled labor\n\u2022  Greater demand for \u2022  Improved labor force\nsemiskilled and participation rates for women\nunskilled labor especially through impact on\nmigrant laborers\n\u2022  Reduced employment gap for\nwomen relative to men\n\u2022  Greater mobility of labor from\nhousehold/informal sector to\nformal sector\n\u2022  Improved living standards of\nsemiskilled and unskilled\nworkers at poverty margin\nincluding household sector\nworkers\u2019 supplying small and\nmedium enterprises (SMEs)\nShort-Term Long-Term Non-Poor\nGovernance Small impact \u2022  Positive overall from Moderate from reduced\nderegulation and enhanced telephony costs\ncompetition that lowers\nbusiness costs\n\u2022  Positive from reduced\ntelephony costs\nPrices No effect Favorable from relative fall in costs Positive impact\nof access to finance\nFunding Facility Limited positive impact \u2022  Significant benefits through Positive from improved\nand Capacity stable mechanism for helping access to finance, etc.\nBuilding for weaker SMEs and first-time\nSMEs entrepreneurs strengthen\nbusiness skills and access to\nfinance\n\u2022  Stronger linkage with and\nemployment expansion in\nhousehold sector\nTotal Net Effect\n(cid:1)  Pro-poor: better employment prospects for unskilled and semiskilled workers, improved employment status for\nwomen, removal of impediments to business growth and expansion and hence improved access for poor\n(cid:1)  Non-poor: promote pro-market economic policies and improve overall efficiency levels"], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20011203102722", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 3.01 for Windows", "Author": "j3m", "Creator": "ADOBEPS4.DRV Version 4.10", "Title": "Microsoft Word - R254-01.doc", "ModDate": "D:20011221111924+08'00'"}}
