INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) aims to help the Education Sector \nGroup of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to establish and operate an education partnership \nplatform (EPP). The TA and the EPP will help to enhance the knowledge and capacity of \nparticipating developing member countries (DMCs) of the ADB to apply innovative practices in \nimproving learning and labor market outcomes. The EPP will be an open platform for traditional \ndonor  country  partners  and  nontraditional  partners\u2014such  as  foundations,  civil  society \norganizations (CSOs), centers of excellence, and large corporations\u2014with the flexibility to support \ncountry, subsector, and theme-specific priorities of partners. It will support the development of \nDMCs\u2019 knowledge and human resources to improve student learning and labor market links of \neducation  projects.  Effective  coordination  is  essential  to  match  supply  and  demand  of \ndevelopment assistance and take full advantage of the potential resources that can be made \navailable. This TA will (i) provide initial funding to leverage other sources of support from different \npartners; and (ii) seek supplementary TA support from ADB resources, depending on the progress \nof TA implementation and availability of resources from partners. In addition to supporting the \nEPP\u2019s secretariat functions, the TA will fund EPP-supported priority projects to conduct research \nand pilot activities or to formulate proposals for investment projects in the education sector. The \nEPP will try to tap the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and other ADB-managed financing \npartnership facilities for specific projects.1 \n \n2.  The TA is included in the Management-approved annual work plan of the Education Sector \nGroup (EdSG) under the Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department (SDSC) for \n2017 and is endorsed by the Strategy, Policy and Review Department (SPD) as a corporate \npriority TA.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Asia and the Pacific is one of the most dynamic regions in the world. It is home to more \nthan 50% of the global population and contributes about 40% of global output and two-thirds of \nglobal growth. Most DMCs are middle-income countries that are pursuing high economic growth \nto move up the value chain. Rapid changes in technology and growing automation, demographic \nchanges, rapid urbanization, rising inequality, growing impact of climate change, unprecedented \nlabor mobility, and increasing regional integration are shaping the region\u2019s development, which \nwill require more responsive education systems to anticipate and prepare for related skills and \njobs. High-quality inclusive education is essential to develop an agile workforce and transform \nhuman capital to underpin a modern, competitive economy. \n \n4.  Since early 2000s, ADB mainly supported the expansion of access to basic and secondary \neducation, and to some extent  to technical and vocational education and training (TVET). \nHowever, access is still an issue in some DMCs, particularly for girls and in conflict-affected \nsituations. Demand is growing, particularly from middle-income countries, to align their education \nsystems  with  workforce  and  economic  development.  Global  commitment  to  Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals (SDGs) 4 (education) and 8 (employment) requires deepening support for \nstudent learning and labor market outcomes. It also requires greater synergy between secondary \neducation, TVET, and higher education to improve cognitive, noncognitive, and occupational skills \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 18 August 2017. \n2  ADB (SPD). 2016.

Communication on Funding. E-mail. 7 June (internal, additional $500,000 funding). \n ", "2 \nin close partnership with industries and employers. While digital literacy has emerged as a 21st \ncentury  core  skill,  the  education  sector  is  yet  to  take  full  advantage  of  information  and \ncommunication technology (ICT) and artificial intelligence in improving student learning. Given \nthe changes happening in the labor market, the education sector in ADB DMCs must respond to \nthe question of what the future education system needs to teach. \n \n5.  ADB's priorities for the education sector are to (i) scale up lending from 4.6% of its average \nlending operations from 2014\u20132016 to 6%\u201310% by 2020, (ii) provide cross-support to different \ngrowth sectors, and (iii) apply innovative practices such as the use of ICT and smart partnerships \nto improve student learning and labor market outcomes in ADB-funded projects. As DMCs \ntransition to higher levels of economic development, more jobs will become knowledge-based \nand will require the adoption of new technologies and knowledge. This will also require support \nfor tertiary education institutions in DMCs to modernize curriculum and teaching and learning; \nnurture entrepreneurship and leadership; and promote science, technology, and innovation. It is \nalso critical to deal with growing inequalities (SDG 10) and unsustainable pressure on the \nenvironment (SDG 13), which pose high risks to the long-term economic growth of many DMCs. \nThis is viewed from the perspective of what skills are needed to meet these challenges, such as \npromoting renewable energy and building resilience in environmentally vulnerable and disaster-\nprone areas. \n \n6.  ADB has been providing support for education from its existing TA-financing mechanisms, \nsuch as the TA for Partnership for Innovation in Education in Asia and the Pacific,3 in the absence \nof a dedicated financing partnership facility for education. While nontraditional partners such as \nprivate foundations, industries, and CSOs have offered to bring innovative practices and provide \nin-kind contributions, ADB did not have an effective mechanism to take advantage of such \nexpressions of interest. \n \n7.  Business as usual will not work in managing the above challenges. What is needed is \nsupport for participating DMCs in selectively strengthening their human resources to boost \ncompetitiveness  and  innovations  in  products  and  services,  processes,  structures,  and  the \nsustainable financing of education. The TA will help leverage financing to achieve the EdSG\u2019s \nthree priorities (para. 5). The number of DMCs receiving education support from ADB is expected \nto increase from 22 in 2017 to more than 25 by 2020. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: education sector development efforts in ADB \nDMCs substantially increased.4 The TA will have the following outcome: knowledge of and \ncapacity to apply innovative and good practices in improving learning and labor market outcomes \nenhanced.5 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n9.  Output 1: EPP launched and operationalized. The TA will help mobilize grant funds and \nin-kind contributions of traditional and nontraditional partners to help conceptualize and pilot \n                                                \n3  ADB. 2013.

Manila. \n5  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "3 \ninnovative ideas to scale up education operations in line with the emerging priorities of DMCs. \nThe EPP will serve as a partnership platform to allow in-kind and financial contributions with a \nflexibility to support preferred areas of education and countries. EdSG will adopt a three-pronged \nstrategy to establish an EPP: (i) selectively mobilize secondees6 to develop priority programs \njointly with interested development partners; (ii) seek partnerships with private foundations and \nCSOs; and (iii) develop specific proposals for ongoing, pipeline, and new projects to mobilize \nadditional resources from partners for priority areas. \n \n10.  Output 2: Strategic education TA, pilot projects, and knowledge-sharing efforts \nsupported. The TA will directly support key and/or pilot projects such as (i) advancing youth \nemployment and entrepreneurship, girls\u2019 and women\u2019s education, and ICT-enabled teaching and \nlearning;  (ii)  supporting  marginalized  groups  and  those  living  in  conflict-affected  and \nenvironmentally vulnerable areas; and (iii) linking skills to future jobs in light of technological \nchanges and automation. The TA may also support research for a forward-looking study on the \nrole of education in human society. \n \n11.  Output  3:  Education  experts\u2019  pool  and  select  partnerships  operationalized.  In \nconsultation with the regional departments and project officers, the TA will identify a pool of \nexperts, primarily consultants, to support EdSG with upstream and downstream work, including \nproject design and implementation of select new and ongoing projects. The experts will support \nearly conceptualization, selective pilot testing, and scaling-up of innovative projects to improve \nstudent learning and labor market outcomes in line with DMC requirements and priorities. They \nwill  also  selectively  support  high-quality  sector  and  labor  market  assessment  and  impact \nevaluation. The selected pilot projects will include cross-support for priority sectors such as health, \nagriculture, and infrastructure to support skills development in participating DMCs. \n \n12.  Building on ADB\u2019s partnership with The HEAD Foundation,7 the TA will help establish \nabout five operationally relevant partnerships8 with regionally and globally known centers of \nexcellence to pursue policy dialogue with DMCs on key reforms and to strengthen the capacity of \nDMC and EdSG staff to provide the most appropriate solutions to some of the challenges \ndescribed in paras. 3 and 4 and the opportunities noted in para. 10. A major effort will be to draw \non good practices and innovative models relevant to emerging priorities (e.g., in ICT and public\u2013\nprivate partnerships). Discussions are already underway with several potential partners that can \ncomplement EdSG priorities. \n \n13.  Output 4: Human resource capacity of DMCs enhanced in select and priority areas. \nA critical element of successful education systems is  the effective management of human \nresources in the education sector to continuously pursue relevant reforms and improvements in \nline with emerging needs. This may be related to (i) establishing enabling education policies to \nimprove learning outcomes of all learners, (ii) establishing benchmarking and robust monitoring \nmechanisms to track progress, (iii) ensuring appropriate incentives to drive intended reforms, and \n(iv) pursuing innovative approaches. Customized professional development programs jointly \n                                                \n6  Secondees are persons from institutions/organizations outside of ADB having specific qualifications and experiences \nthat can help ADB deliver on a specific initiative/project.  Secondees are engaged by ADB on a temporary basis.  \n7  In 2016, ADB and The HEAD Foundation (http://headfoundation.org)  organized a professional learning program on \nimproving schooling quality. This was well received by DMC and ADB participants, who found the program highly \nrelevant to meeting the challenges of quality, teacher training, and school leadership. ADB and The HEAD \nFoundation conducted a second run of this training in 2017 for another group of participants from DMCs and ADB \nregional departments. \n8  Prospective partnerships during TA preparation do not involve a transfer of funds. If future partnerships will involve \na transfer of funds, ADB will prepare a knowledge partnership agreement with such partner. \n ", "4 \norganized with partners can also target DMC and ADB personnel to strengthen human resource \ncapacity  in  areas  such  as  outsourcing,  public\u2013private  partnerships,  ICT  applications,  and \nmanaging programmatic approaches to scale up operations. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The key expenditure items are listed \nin Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  ADB  will  administer  the  TA.  ADB\u2019s  Sustainable  Development  and  Climate  Change \nDepartment will select, supervise, and evaluate consultants; prepare knowledge products; and \nprovide  resources  for  staff  to  act  as  resource  persons  in  workshops.  EdSG  will  lead  the \nimplementation within ADB, and the Education Sector Committee will review the annual program \nand its subsequent progress every 6 months. The implementation will take 5 years, beginning in \nOctober 2017. The TA will mobilize supplementary resources from partners and ADB's own \nresources depending on TA progress. Disbursements under the TA will follow the Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). The TA will adopt a \nflexible approach to supporting priority demand from the regional departments and the EdSG \nSecretariat in line with the annual work plan. ADB will engage TA consultants individually following \nADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The total \nrequirements are estimated at 25 person-months of international consultants and 50 person-\nmonths of national consultants. In addition, partnerships will support select priority areas such as \nadvisory services, knowledge products, and professional development. \n \nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  October 2017\u2013August 2022 \nExecuting agency  Asian Development Bank \nImplementing agencies  Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department through \nthe Education Sector Group \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by the Education Sector Group \nIndividual selection  25 person-months  $450,000 \n(international,  (intermittent) \nremuneration) \nIndividual selection  50 person-months  $350,000 \n(national,  (intermittent) \nremuneration) \nDisbursement  The technical assistance resources will be disbursed following \nADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as \namended from time to time). \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n ", "5 \n16.  Consulting services. The TA will involve 75 person-months of services by international \nand national consultants on input-based contracts,9 including (i) an education specialist for K-1210 \nreforms, (ii) a TVET specialist, (iii) a higher education specialist, (iv) an education ICT specialist, \nand (v) a pool of international consultants for promoting innovative practices. The TA will also \nengage  a  pool  of  national  consultants  whose  expertise  is  based  on  that  of  international \nconsultants, but in a local context. Such expertise includes (i) supporting ongoing or pipeline \nprojects, pilot programs, conferences, seminars or workshops, knowledge products, stakeholder \nconsultations,  special  case  studies,  communications;  and  (ii)  working  with  partners.  All \nconsultants shall be engaged following the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from \ntime to time)11 and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to \ntime).  \n \n17.  Pilot testing of project approach. The TA will incorporate select pilot projects12 in priority \nareas such as ICT application in education, renewable energy training, promotion of girls\u2019 and \nwomen\u2019s  education,  entrepreneurship  training,  school  leadership,  and  teacher  quality \nimprovement. Results and recommendations from the pilot tests will help regional departments \nscale up ongoing and pipeline projects. EdSG will also tap funds from other sources such as the \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction and the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership \nFund to supplement financing of such pilot projects. EdSG will also ensure that TA activities will \nnot result in any potential adverse environmental and/or social impacts. \n \n18.  Social media and websites. The TA will establish social media sites and/or relevant \nwebsites to serve as a repository of TA activities, including sharing of good practices and lessons \nlearned. This will complement online collaboration efforts of the Sustainable Development and \nClimate Change Department\u2019s Knowledge Sharing and Services Center and promote cooperation \nwith stakeholders. Upon TA completion, these sites will be maintained by the EdSG Secretariat. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $2,000,000 on a grant basis for \nthe Innovation in Education Sector Development in Asia and the Pacific, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n \n                                                \n9  The TA may consider output-based and/or lump-sum contracts and use of the framework agreement, as appropriate. \n10  K-12 is the kindergarten to grade 12 or primary to secondary schooling system adopted by many Asian countries like \nMongolia and the Philippines.  \n11  Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n12 The cost of pilot testing will not exceed 30% of ADB TA financing.
