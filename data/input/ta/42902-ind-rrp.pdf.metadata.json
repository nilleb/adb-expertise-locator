I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan of \nup to Rs4.45 billion to Gujarat Paguthan Energy Corporation Private Limited (GPEC) to finance \nthe Samana Wind Power Project in Gujarat, India and the Saundatti Wind Power Project in \nKarnataka,  India  (the  two  projects  collectively  referred  to  as  the  Project).  The  design  and \nmonitoring framework and the development effectiveness framework are presented in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  INTRODUCTION \n \n2.  India is endowed with abundant renewable energy sources\u2014solar, wind, biomass, and \nsmall hydroelectric\u2014and the Government of India is working proactively to develop them. Under \nthe \u201cPower for All by 2012\u201d initiative, the Government has envisaged universal electricity supply by \n2012. The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) of the Government of India, formerly \nthe  Ministry  of  Non-Conventional  Energy  Sources  (MNES),  has  proposed  exploiting  the  full \npotential  of  renewable  energy  sources  to  increase  generation  capacity  in  the  country.  The \nNational Electricity Policy, issued by the Ministry of Power, Government of India on 12 February \n2005, also emphasizes the development of renewable energy sources. \n \n3.  Since its inception, India\u2019s renewable energy program has been driven by policies and \npromotional measures initially framed by MNRE and subsequently by India\u2019s respective state \ngovernments. The promotional measures available to renewable energy projects comprise a wide \nrange  of  fiscal  and  financial  incentives,  including  soft  loans,  concessional  customs  duties, \nexemption from excise duty, tax holidays, and accelerated depreciation benefits. \n \n4.  To accelerate the promotion of renewable energy development in their respective states, \nboth the Gujarat Electricity Regulation Commission (GERC) and Karnataka Electricity Regulatory \nCommission  (KERC)  have  stipulated  minimum  amounts  of  renewable  energy  purchase \nobligations on licensed distributors operating in the states. Starting 2010, GERC will require \nlicensed distributors to procure at least 2% of their total energy input from renewable energy \nsources. The KERC has stipulated that 10% of energy purchase by distributors should be in the \nform of renewable energy. \n \n5.  GPEC  is  an  existing,  single-asset  company  that  currently  owns  and  operates  a  655 \nmegawatt (MW) gas-fired power plant at Bharuch, Gujarat, India. GPEC belongs to the CLP \nGroup (founded in 1901 as the China Light and Power Company Limited) and is 100% indirectly \nowned by CLP Holdings Limited, Hong Kong. The CLP Group consists of a conglomerate of \ncompanies with a portfolio of over 30 generation assets and retail businesses in different countries \nin the Asia-Pacific region. The group has investments in over 30,000 MW gross generation \nassets. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has an existing satisfactory relationship with the CLP \nGroup through its 2003 financing of BLCP Power Limited, a 1,434 MW coal-fired power plant in \nThailand1. Over the last few years, the CLP group has shown a strong commitment to the \nprinciples of sustainable development and has been taking a proactive stance towards addressing \nissues related to climate change. In 2004, the group set a target of generating 5% of its output \nfrom renewable sources by 2010, which was met 3 years ahead of time. As a part of the CLP \nGroup,  GPEC  also  has  a  major  thrust  toward  renewable  energy.  In  light  of  the  increasing \nregulatory support for wind power generation in India, GPEC has decided to undertake a number \nof wind power projects throughout the country, of which the Project forms the first phase. With the \nsuccessful financial closure of the Tata Power Company\u2019s Khandke and Bramenvel wind power \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2003.

Manila. \n ", "2   \nprojects2 in India in 2007 (in which ADB provided long-term debt financing), GPEC has been in \nactive discussions with ADB on its wind energy plans in India. It has approached ADB for long-\nterm debt financing to implement its wind energy projects being set up at Samana, Gujarat and \nSaundatti, Karnataka. Concept clearance for the proposed loan was approved in December 2007 \nand environmental and social site visits were conducted in January 2008. If approved, this would \nbe ADB\u2019s largest assistance to a private sector wind power project. \n \nIII.  BACKGROUND \n \nA.  Sector Background in India \n \n1.  Demand and Supply of Power in India \n \n6.  India is the third largest electricity consumer in Asia behind the People\u2019s Republic of China \nand Japan. As of 31 December 2006, installed power generation capacity in India was 127,753 \nMW, of which 56% was owned and operated by state entities, 33% by central public sector \nundertakings, and 11% by independent power producers and other private sector utilities. Thermal \npower plants, mostly coal-fired, provide 66% of the installed capacity. Hydropower accounts for \n26% of the capacity, with gas and oil-fired thermal plants, renewable energy plants, and nuclear \nplants providing the remaining 8%.3 Industry buys approximately 35% of the electricity sold in \nIndia, followed by households at 25%, agriculture at 22%, and businesses and others at 18%.4 \nDespite its growing economy, India\u2019s annual consumption per capita remains relatively low at \nslightly over 600 kilowatt hours (kWh). In addition, power quality remains poor, marked by high \nvoltage fluctuations and recurring load shedding. India continues to suffer from chronic electricity \nshortages, with peak demand exceeding supply by 13.8% and the energy deficit at 9.6% in        \nFY 2007.5 \n \n7.  Power demand in India has grown rapidly as the economy has expanded at an annual \naverage rate of 6.8% in real terms since FY1995.6 As the 10th Five Year Plan (FY2003\u2013FY2007) \nachieved only 52% of the targeted capacity addition, energy shortfalls will persist over the short to \nmedium term. Target capacity has been expanded for the 11th Five Year Plan period (FY2008\u2013\nFY2012) to 78,577 MW,7 so as to catch up on the longer-term economic growth target. This is \nexpected to allow India to achieve the national electricity policy goal of Power for All by 2012 and \nper capita availability of power to reach 1,000 kWh by FY2012. \n \n8.  Both  Gujarat  and  Karnataka,  the  states  where  the  Project  will  be  implemented,  face \nsignificant power shortages, as shown in Table 1 below.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n2 ADB. 2007.

Monthly Review of Power Sector. New Delhi (April and December). \n \n2.  Wind Power Sector in India \n \n9.  As the Indian power sector has grown, India has become increasingly dependent on fossil \nfuels. With continued and sustained hikes in oil and gas prices in recent years, as well as the \nexpected fossil fuel shortages in the future, the security of energy supply in India has generated \nincreasing concern. The environmental concern over excess use of fossil fuels is also on the rise. \nIn  this  context,  India  urgently  needs  to  explore  sustainable  energy  development,  and  the \nGovernment has been working proactively to promote the use of renewable energy sources. \n \n10.  Among the renewable power resources available in India, wind energy is a promising \nsource for further development. India has over 45,000 MW of gross potential and 13,000 MW of \ntechnical potential for wind power. As of September 2007, India had over 7,700 MW of installed \nwind power capacity, ranking the country fourth in the world after Germany, United States, and \nSpain. While the 10th Five Year Plan targeted a 2,200 MW increase of installed wind power \ncapacity, over 5,400 MW was actually installed.8 \n \n11.  The  Government  has  provided  support  measures  to  increase  renewable  energy \ncontributions in the country. It has also issued policy guidelines for the state governments to \nestablish and maintain state-specific policies to promote renewable power projects. These include \npermission to accelerate depreciation, concession or full exemption from customs duties, tax \nholidays, and soft loans available through government-owned agencies. \n \n12.  Gujarat and Karnataka are two of the leading states in wind generation in India. With long \ncoastlines and certain suitable inland areas, these two states account for more than 36% of the \ngross potential to be harnessed from wind resources, with Gujarat accounting for an estimated \n9,675 MW of gross potential and Karnataka 6,620 MW. As of 31 March 2007, installed wind \npower capacity was 667 MW in Gujarat and 849 MW in Karnataka, which in aggregate accounted \nfor 21% of total installed wind capacity in the country and ranks them among the top four states in \nwind generation. A further 161 MW and 54 MW were installed during the April\u2013September 2007 \nperiod in Gujarat and Karnataka, respectively. A detailed summary of the wind power sector in \nIndia is in Appendix 2. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n8  Ministry of New and Renewable Energy. 2007. Annual Report 2006\u20132007. New Delhi. \n ", "4   \nB.  Asian Development Bank Operations \n \n1.  Country Strategy  \n \n13.  Mainstreaming poverty reduction is the central organizing theme of ADB\u2019s country strategy \nand program (CSP) for India.9 It draws on the three pillars of ADB\u2019s poverty reduction strategy: \npro-poor growth, social development, and good governance. The strategy aims to support the \nGovernment\u2019s high-growth agenda by assisting fiscal consolidation, infrastructure development, \nand private sector development. Political and economic developments since finalizing the CSP \nindicate that its assistance strategy remains valid, especially the core strategy of poverty reduction \nthrough infrastructure-led growth supported by social development and good governance. The \n2006\u20132008  CSP10  update  suggests  that  the  objective  of  accelerating  India\u2019s  annual  gross \ndomestic product growth to 8% depends on upgrading infrastructure facilities and improving the \nefficiency of such public services. ADB\u2019s proposed assistance program reflects this priority, with \ninfrastructure accounting for nearly 77% of the 3-year pipeline (not including private sector and \nother nonsovereign operations). \n \n2.  ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy \n \n14.  ADB\u2019s energy sector strategy11 establishes its operational priorities as (i) reducing poverty \nby, among others, creating energy infrastructure for sustainable economic growth; (ii) promoting \nprivate  sector  involvement  by  restructuring  the  energy  sector  and  creating  an  enabling \nenvironment for private investors; (iii) addressing regional and global environmental impacts; and \n(iv)  promoting  regional  cooperation.  In  particular,  the  strategy  strongly  encourages  ADB \ninterventions to increase investment in the renewable energy subsector, as well as to increase \nprivate sector participation in the energy sector to take advantage of the higher operational \nefficiencies that private operators can achieve and to meet the large capital requirements. \n \n15.  ADB\u2019s assistance for the power sector, as outlined in the 2006\u20132008 CSP update, has six \nmain priorities: (i) reforming the sector; (ii) promoting higher efficiency and low-carbon power \nsources that are locally available; (iii) expanding and optimizing transmission and distribution \nsystems; (iv) supporting institutional strengthening to implement reforms required by the Electricity \nAct of 2003, including development of more flexible power delivery and trading systems; (v) \npromoting private sector participation; and (vi) encouraging energy conservation, and ensuring \nenvironmental and social sustainability. To support the Government\u2019s Power for All by 2012 \ninitiative, ADB\u2019s strategy for the power sector will create synergy with the 11th Five Year Plan. \nThis includes development of sustainable energy sources, particularly promotion of renewable \nenergy projects. \n \nIV.  THE BORROWER \n \nA.  Background \n \n16.  GPEC owns and operates a single-asset: a 655 MW gas-fired combined cycle power plant \nat Paguthan, near Bharuch in Gujarat. The company was set up in 1992 under the name Gujarat \nTorrent  Energy  Corporation  Limited  as  a  joint  venture  between  the  Torrent  Group  of  India, \nPowergen of UK, the government of Gujarat, and Siemens AG. In 2002, Powergen purchased the \nstakes of the other three entities in the joint venture, and in June 2003 divested its entire equity \nstake in favor of the CLP Group. CLP Holdings, the group holding company, currently has 100% \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2003. Country Strategy and Program (2003\u20132006): India.

Shareholders, Management, and Corporate Governance \n \n17.  The  CLP  Group  is  one  of  the  leading  investor-owned  power  utilities  in  Asia.  It  is  a \nconglomerate of companies with a portfolio of over 30 generation assets and retail businesses in \ndifferent countries in the Asia Pacific. CLP Holdings Limited (rated A [negative creditwatch]/A-1 \n[negative  creditwatch]  by  Standard  &  Poor\u2019s/Moody\u2019s),  is  listed  on  the  Hong  Kong  Stock \nExchange and had a market capitalization of approximately $19 billion as of 31 January 2008. The \nCLP Group registered total revenues of $5.8 billion in 2006 and earnings of $1.3 billion. In Hong \nKong, China, the CLP Group operates through CLP Power Hong Kong Limited, a vertically \nintegrated electricity generation, transmission and distribution business with an installed capacity \nof 6,908 MW and a transmission capacity of 12,000 kilometers (km). The CLP Group supplies \nelectricity to approximately 80% of the population in Hong Kong, China.  \n \n18.  GPEC is the CLP Group\u2019s first investment in India and will be the investment vehicle for all \nof the group\u2019s wholly owned projects in the country. GPEC derives strong management, technical \nand financial support from its parent. Its top management is nominated by CLP\u2019s board and its \nmanaging director is a part of the CLP Group\u2019s senior management team. GPEC is managed by \nnine directors on its board, of which seven represent the CLP Group and two represent local \nfinancial institutions. Rajiv Mishra, the managing director of the company, handles the day-to-day \nmanagement of GPEC under the supervision and control of the board of directors. As of 30 June \n2007, the company had 119 employees. \n \n19.  The CLP Group has a well-established code on corporate governance and policies. The \ncode applies to directors, officers, and employees of CLP Holdings; its wholly owned subsidiaries; \nand joint ventures or companies in which the group holds a controlling interest. In the case of joint \nventures or companies in which the CLP Group does not hold a controlling interest, the CLP \nrepresentatives concerned are expected to act in accordance with the code themselves and to do \neverything possible to influence those with whom they are working to ensure that they also act to \nsimilar standards of integrity and ethical behavior. The CLP corporate governance framework lays \ndown procedures applicable to enforcement of shareholder rights, activities of the board and \nboard committees, management and staff, and auditors. Eight board committees have been \ncreated to oversee various aspects of the board\u2019s operations, including audit; remuneration; and \nsocial, environmental, and ethics-related issues. In addition, the CLP Group has formulated a \nnumber of policies including a fair disclosure policy, guidelines on related-party transactions, an \nanti-fraud policy, and procurement values and principles. As a fully owned subsidiary, GPEC is \nalso obligated to adhere to the principles enunciated by the CLP Group. \n \nC.  Operational Performance \n \n20.  GPEC\u2019s power plant at Paguthan is a critical source of power to the state of Gujarat and \naccounts  for  about  8%  of  the  state\u2019s  power  needs.  The  plant  has  shown  strong  operating \nperformance since inception and has consistently achieved a plant availability close to 90%, while \nkeeping forced outages at very low levels. GPEC\u2019s operations and maintenance strategy has \nfocused on maximizing plant availability, ensuring operational safety and optimizing maintenance \ncosts. Critical maintenance activities such as hot gas path inspections have been carried out in \naccordance with the recommendations of the original equipment suppliers on a regular basis. \nGPEC has also consistently achieved high levels of plant load factors.

The Saundatti Wind Power Project is located at Saundatti Taluka, \nBelgaum district, Karnataka state, and is about 85 km from Belgaum and about 80 km from Hubli. \nBoth sites are well connected by roads to a number of mid-sized cities in their respective states. \n \n22.  The Samana Wind Power Project involves the construction and operation of 100.8 MW of \nwind power generation facilities. The Project is physically a part of a larger wind energy farm \ncurrently being developed by Enercon (India) Limited (EIL) for GPEC and other interested power \nproducers. Upon completion, the Samana wind farm as a whole will have 450 wind turbine \ngenerators (WTGs) with a combined power generation capacity of 360 MW (0.8 MW per WTG). \nOf the 450 WTGs, 126 WTGs will be owned by GPEC as a part of the Project while the remaining \n324 WTGs will be owned by other power producers. Power from each WTG will be transmitted at \n33kV to a power collection system at the Sadodar substation located inside the wind farm. The \nsubstation will be owned and operated by EIL and is proposed to have four 100 million volt-amp \n(MVA) transformers to step up the power from 33 kV to 220kV. \n \n23.  The Saundatti Wind Power Project involves the construction and operation of 82.4 MW of \nwind power generation facilities (103 units of 0.8 MW each). This project is also being developed \nby EIL exclusively for GPEC. Power generated at the wind farm will be pooled through a power \ncollection system and fed into the Karnataka Power Transmission Corporation Limited (KPTCL) \nsubstation located near Saundatti town on the southern ridge of the wind farm. The substation \ncurrently has 2 X 20 MVA transformers to step up power from 33 kV to 110 kV. \n \n24.  The combined Project will be the largest wind project undertaken by the CLP Group to date \nand will increase its renewable energy portfolio by almost one third. \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n25.  EIL has received the requisite permissions from Gujarat Energy Development Agency \n(GEDA)  and  government  of  Karnataka  for  developing  wind  energy  farms  in  Samana  and \nSaundatti. Subsequently it approached GPEC with proposals to transfer the two projects to GPEC \nand develop them on a turnkey basis covering all aspects of development and commissioning. \nGPEC conducted its own legal and technical due diligence on the projects, including a detailed \nwind  assessment  study  with  the  assistance  of  Hydro  Tasmania  Consulting.12  Further,  the \ncommercial and technical feasibility of each Project was evaluated by GPEC covering plant load \nfactor projections, grid losses, technology, grid availability, operation and maintenance (O&M) \ncharges, capital cost, and state tariff policies. The proposals were negotiated between GPEC and \nEIL and eventually GPEC executed separate facilitation agreements with EIL for developing the \ntwo projects. The facilitation agreements are comprehensive in nature. Under these agreements, \nEIL  will  transfer  the  projects  to  GPEC  and  will  be  responsible  for  (i)  design,  development, \nconstruction, and commissioning; (ii) land procurement/acquisition; and (iii) all regulatory and \nstatutory approvals. The contracts are fixed price turnkey contracts with suitable provisions for \nrecovery of liquidated damages for delays in implementation. \n \n                                                 \n12 Hydro Tasmania is a government business enterprise owned by the state of Tasmania in Australia. Hydro \nTasmania Consulting, an arm of Hydro Tasmania, draws on around 100 years of expertise of Hydro Tasmania in \nthe areas of renewable energy and power engineering.  \n ", "  7\n26.  EIL is a 56:44 joint venture between Enercon GmbH of Germany (the second largest wind \nenergy company in the world) and the Mehra group of Mumbai. EIL started commercial operations \nin 1995, and crossed the milestone of 1,000 WTGs and 500 MW capacity during 2004\u20132005. \nWorldwide, Enercon GmbH has already installed over 7,400 WTGs with an installed capacity of \n6,600 MW. EIL has strong financials, with 2006\u20132007 revenues exceeding Rs22 billion and a net \nworth of Rs4.7 billion. \n \n27.  Wind power generation technology is well established and as such the Project does not \nface significant technological risks. EIL will employ for the Project E-53 WTGs, which are currently \nthe most advanced wind turbines being manufactured by EIL in India. The E-53 WTGs have a \nproven track record and are being used in a Tata Power wind energy project earlier funded by \nADB. The E-53s are upgraded versions of the already established E-48 WTGs but with larger \nblade diameters. Each wind turbine generator will be installed at a hub height of 74 meters (m) \nwith a rotor diameter of 53 m. The E-53 design also features a recently developed high-efficiency \nblade with root spoilers and winglet tips. This design enables more energy to be extracted from \nthe same swept area when compared with a conventional blade design and reduces the noise \nfrom the blade tips. Other features include the class S features to specifically cater to Indian wind \nconditions (extreme wind velocity of 57 meters per second [m/s] and an average wind speed \nvelocity equivalent to 7.5 m/s) and a gearbox-free design. \n \n28.  Wind data for both locations was initially provided by EIL based on raw data collected over \nabout 2 years. This data was reviewed in house by Roaring 40s Renewable Energy Pte. Ltd., \nwhich is a joint venture between the CLP Group and Hydro Tasmania. This joint venture has \nextensive experience in wind assessment and construction of wind farms across Australia, the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, and India. Hydro Tasmania Consulting modeled 20-year synthesized \ndata resulting in the generation of long-term annual energy output estimates for both the sites.  \n \n29.  GPEC has also signed comprehensive warranty O&M agreements with EIL for both the \nprojects, whose scope includes repairs and/or replacement of defective parts, operations and \nmaintenance (scheduled and unscheduled) and assistance in manning site office and record \nmaintenance. The O&M contracts stipulate a fixed price payable to EIL per WTG (increasing over \nthe years) for an initial period of 10 years. The contract comes with an availability guarantee (97% \nfor the high-wind season and 95% for the low-wind season) and performance guarantees. GPEC \nwill take a comprehensive insurance cover during the operational phase of the Project.  \n \n30.  The  Samana  Project  started  in  July  2007  and  the  first  set  of  11  WTGs  will  be \ncommissioned by April 2008. The entire project is expected to be commissioned by January 2009. \nFor the Saundatti Project, delivery of the WTGs will commence in a phased manner starting \nMarch 2009 and the Project is expected to be fully commissioned by June 2009. \n \nC.  Evacuation and Selling Arrangements \n \n31.  The Samana wind farm is already connected to the high-tension grid. Power generated by \nthe various WTGs will be pooled into a common substation located at Sadodar within the wind \nfarm, then metered and fed into the Gujarat Electric Transmission Corporation (GETCO) grid for \nsale to GUVNL. EIL will suitably expand the Sadodar substation as more WTGs come into \noperation at the site and EIL will be responsible for the substation\u2019s O&M. Power from the \nSaundatti wind farm will be pooled from the WTGs and evacuated through the KPTCL substation \nlocated near Saundatti town. GPEC had commissioned a study to review the adequacy of power \nevacuation infrastructure in Saundatti, which has reported adequate evacuation arrangements. \n \n32.  GPEC will sell its output from the Samana Project to GUVNL under a 20-year PPA in line \nwith the new renewable energy policy in effect in the state. The PPA will be executed prior to \ncommissioning of the Project. The tariff has been fixed at Rs3.37 per kWh for the entire tenor of \n ", "8   \nthe PPA. Twenty-five percent of gross Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) revenues through \nthe sale of certified emission reductions (CERs) will be shared with GUVNL. GPEC has already \ninitiated the CDM registration process for this Project and has submitted the project design \ndocument (PDD) for the first phase (comprising 63 WTGs) to the Ministry of Environment and \nForest, Government of India, which is the designated national authority. PDD for the second \nphase will be prepared upon acquisition of land for the same. The model PPA is a \u201ctake-and-pay\u201d \ncontract, which grants a \u201cmust-run\u201d status to the Project. It provides for complete offtake with \nexplicit clauses providing for shutdowns only in emergency situations. This dilutes any risk of \nshutdowns as a result of capacity-requirements-based back-down situations. With the Gujarat \nElectricity Regulatory Commission (GERC) stipulating a minimum renewable purchase obligation \n(RPO) on utilities (currently 1% of total purchase, to be increased to 2% from 2010), significant \nrenewable generation capacity of up to 780 MW will require to be set up in the state, largely \nthrough the wind sector. The Samana Project is therefore assured of offtake by GUVNL, both as \nper the terms of the PPA as well as RPO obligations imposed by GERC. \n  \n33.  Output from the Saundatti Project will be sold under a 20-year PPA to be executed with one \nof the electricity distribution companies in the state. As per terms of the facilitation agreement with \nEIL, EIL is responsible for facilitating the execution of a PPA in the following order of preference: \nBangalore  Electricity  Supply  Company  (BESCOM),  Mangalore  Electricity  Supply  Company \n(MESCOM), Hubli Electricity Supply Company (HESCOM), Chamundeswari Electricity Supply \nCompany (CHESCOM), and Gulbarga Electricity Supply Company (GESCOM). The model PPA \nhas tariff fixed at Rs3.40 for the first 10 years. Tariffs beyond the first 10 years will be determined \nby the regulator. The PPA does not provide for any CDM revenue-sharing arrangement with the \nofftaker and qualifies as a base load generating station that is not subject to merit order dispatch. \nThe PDD for CDM registration will be prepared in due course upon receipt of ownership of land. \nThe KERC has determined the minimum RPO for state distribution companies at 10%, out of \nwhich about 7% can be met through wind generation.13 This translates to additional potential wind \ncapacity  in  the  state  of  about  800  MW  until  2012.  The  Saundatti  Project,  which  will  be \ncommissioned by mid-2009 will play a critical role in enabling the electricity distribution companies \nmeet their RPO requirements. \n \n34.

Environmental Aspects and Social Dimensions \n \n35.  The Project has been classified as category B for environment because it is unlikely to \ncreate any significant environmental impact during construction and operation. Comprehensive \nenvironmental impact studies for the two projects were completed in January 2008 in line with \nADB\u2019s environmental safeguard policies for environmental category B projects. As per Ministry of \nEnvironment and Forest (MOEF), notification S.O. 1533 dated 14 September 2006, environmental \nclearance is not required for the proposed capacity of the wind power projects. The summary \ninitial environmental examination for the Project is in Appendix 4.  \n \n36.  The  perceptible  environmental  impacts  are  noise  and  visual  impacts,  but  both  are \nconsidered to be insignificant at most given the considerable setback of turbines to the nearest \nsettlements  and  the  landscape  values  of  the  site.  The  environmental  disturbance  normally \nassociated with construction activities (i.e., land disturbance, vegetation clearance, erosion and \nsedimentation, construction noise and traffic, and waste generation) is considered temporary due \nto the limited extent and significance of consequences. The implementation of the environmental \nmanagement plan will minimize or mitigate these impacts that will be continued during project \noperations, and will also include monitoring arrangements. \n \n37.  The Project is classified as category C for involuntary resettlement. Land to be acquired for \nthe Project is located on government, forest, and private lands. Sites located on government or \nforest land would be first leased by the government to EIL which, on commissioning, would be \ntransferred to GPEC through a transfer lease agreement. For privately owned land, the land will \nbe purchased by EIL and later transferred to GPEC after legal due diligence by GPEC. The \nprivate land will be acquired through private negotiations between EIL and the owners on a \nwilling-buyer-to-willing-seller basis. Erection of the WTGs will be on uninhabited land and will not \ncause displacement, affect any physical structures, or lead to the loss of livelihoods. The project \nwill  indirectly  contribute  to  poverty  reduction  by  supporting  economic  development  through \nincreased power generation in the states of Gujarat and Karnataka. Other socioeconomic benefits \nof the Project will include limited employment to community members in the vicinity of the WTGs. \n \n38.  As the Project is classified as category C for indigenous peoples, an indigenous peoples\u2019 \nplan is not required. There are no indigenous peoples (scheduled tribes) living close to or within \nthe sites identified for the two projects. The Project has no perceptible impacts on distinct tribal \ngroups in the project areas. Since the forest land on both sites is degraded forest with thorny \nbushes and shrubs, it hosts no forest-dependent peoples. \n \nE.  Development Impacts \n \n1.  Impact, Outcome, and Output \n \n39.  The Project aims to promote sustainable growth in India through contributions toward \nachieving minimum share targets for renewable energy in the generation mix and toward India\u2019s \nPower for All goal. The Project, which aims to construct 183.2 MW of wind energy generation \nfacilities, will be one of the largest such initiatives in the country. The Project will catalyze private \nsector investment in India\u2019s renewable energy sector, mitigate significant amount of greenhouse \ngas (GHG) emissions and improve the energy security of the country by developing indigenous \nenergy sources. It will help reduce the current energy and peak power shortages in the Indian \nstates  of  Gujarat  and  Karnataka.  The  Project  is  part  of  a  unique  model  for  private  sector \nparticipation in renewable energy envisaging successful collaboration between a private turnkey \nproject developer and a strategic investor. The Project\u2019s design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1. \n \n \n ", "10  \n2.  Development Effectiveness \n \n40.  The development effectiveness of the Project will be assessed in terms of private sector \ndevelopment,  business  success,  and  economic  sustainability  as  per  the  guidelines  for \nimplementing  the  Good-Practice  Standards  for  Evaluation  of  Private  Sector  Investment \nOperations,14 prepared by the Evaluation Cooperation Group of the multilateral development \nbanks. The Project will lead to private sector development by introducing a new business model of \ncollaboration between a private turnkey developer and a strategic investor. Being one of the \nlargest private sector wind operations in the country, the Project will have a demonstration effect \nfor future private sector investments in wind generation using this model. The Project is financially \nand economically sustainable and also plays a significant role in mitigating GHGs, thus leading to \nglobal environmental benefits. The Project\u2019s development effectiveness framework is provided in \nAppendix 1. \n \nVI.  THE PROPOSED ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Loan \n \n41.  ADB will provide a local currency loan of up to Rs4.45 billion from its ordinary capital \nresources to GPEC without a government guarantee. Proceeds from the loan will be used for \neligible expenditures for the Project. The proposed loan will have a maturity of up to 13 years \nfrom the date of first disbursement, with an availability period of 15 months and semiannual \nrepayments starting 3 months from scheduled project completion. The loan will carry an interest \nrate, as well as commitment and front-end fees, to be approved by ADB\u2019s pricing and credit \nenhancement committee. \n \n42.  The  loan  will  be  documented  in  a  loan  agreement,  which  will  contain  terms  and \nconditions  standard  for  private  sector  loans  without  government  guarantees,  as  well  as \ncovenants relating to ADB\u2019s policies.15 The ADB loan will share common terms and conditions \nwith other lenders\u2019 loans as far as possible. The loan will be subject to conditions precedent to \nthe disbursement, including all necessary government, creditor, and shareholder approvals and \nconsents;  and  all  contractual  and  financial  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB.  The  loan \nagreement will include (i) appropriate representations and warranties; (ii) covenants, including \naffirmative, negative, financial, and information covenants; and (iii) events of default. \n \n43.  The proposed loan is a secured corporate loan, and ADB will rely on GPEC\u2019s balance \nsheet, cash flows from GPEC\u2019s existing generating asset, and wind power generation revenues. \nAs  security,  ADB  will  require  the  creation  of  a  first  ranking  charge  over  all  movable  and \nimmovable assets of GPEC, which include the gas-based power plant as well as the wind power \nassets. ADB will also require that the security from GPEC be created and perfected as a \ncondition precedent to drawdown or, for certain types of asset classes (e.g., immovable property \nand rights under contracts) as and when practicable during the term of the loan, having regard \nto Indian law and procedure on perfection of security and GPEC\u2019s timetable for entry into \nproject-related contracts. Lenders will also require the establishment of a trust and retention \naccount mechanism whereby all receipts of GPEC will be deposited and utilized only in a pre-\ndetermined priority of utilization. In addition, a debt\u2013service reserve account will be created in \nfavor of the lenders, which will be funded to the extent of prospective 6 months\u2019 debt service \nobligations. All future financing by GPEC will be subject to corporate level covenants, namely a \ndebt\u2013equity ratio not to exceed 2.33:1 and a DSCR not below 1.3 times. \n                                                 \n14 Multilateral Development Banks Evaluation Cooperation Group. 2006. Good-Practice Standards for Evaluation of \nPrivate Sector Investment Operations \u2013 Third Edition. \n15 These covenants include compliance with ADB\u2019s (i) environmental and social safeguard policies; (ii) combating \nmoney laundering, antiterrorism, and anticorruption policies; and (iii) procurement policy to the extent that GPEC \nmust use the loan proceeds for financing eligible goods and services procured from the ADB\u2019s member countries. \n ", "  11\nB.  Justification \n \n44.  The proposed loan merits ADB\u2019s support for the following reasons: \n \n(i)  The proposed loan is consistent with ADB\u2019s CSP for India, which emphasizes \ninfrastructure development, private sector participation, and renewable energy \ndevelopment. Particularly in the power sector, policy dialogue by ADB\u2019s South \nAsia Department has focused on (a) supporting sector reform and restructuring, \n(b)  enhancing  energy  efficiency  and  clean  energy  development,  and  (c) \npromoting  balanced  physical  infrastructure  development.  The  proposed  ADB \nloan is in line with this strategy and dovetails with the efforts including ongoing \ndialogues with the Government under the public sector operations. The Project \nwill aid in meeting the significant energy and power shortages in the states of \nKarnataka and Gujarat. If approved, it will be the largest financing by ADB of a \nprivate sector renewable energy project. \n \n(ii)  The proposed loan is consistent with ADB\u2019s energy sector policy (footnote 11). It \nalso forms a part of ADB\u2019s clean energy and environment program, which was \nlaunched in response to the communiqu\u00e9 by the Group of 8 at the Gleneagles \nSummit in July 2005.16 ADB\u2019s energy policy states that ADB will promote the \ndevelopment of renewable energy sources in developing member countries, and \nthat  ADB  will  also  assist  in  implementing  such  projects,  preferably  through \nprivate sector involvement to ensure their sustainable long-term operations. The \nclean energy and environment program includes implementation of renewable \nenergy investment opportunities. The Project may also benefit from assistance \nfrom ADB\u2019s Asia Pacific Carbon Fund for upfront financing of future revenues \nfrom CERs.  \n \n(iii)  The proposed loan helps increase power generation from renewable energy \nsources in India. India has been trying to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels \nand to develop renewable energy sources, which are abundant in the country, to \nincrease  energy  security  and  promote  environmentally  sustainable  economic \ndevelopment. The proposed ADB loan will assist in adding 12% more wind power \ngeneration capacity in the state of Gujarat, 9% more wind power generation \ncapacity in the state of Karnataka and approximately 2.5% in the country as a \nwhole. \n \n(iv)  The proposed loan will help GPEC and its parent, the CLP Group, to meet their \nstated commitment to increase the share of clean energy in their generation \nportfolio. With the implementation of the Project, the CLP Group will be able to \nincrease the share of wind in its generation portfolio to over 5%. The Project will \nalso help distribution licensees in Gujarat and Karnataka meet their renewable \npurchase obligations.  \n \n(v)  The  proposed  loan  helps  improve  the  country\u2019s  environmental  standards  by \nreducing greenhouse gas emissions. The Project will reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions  by  over  400,000  tons  of  carbon  dioxide  (CO )  per  year  and  by \n2\napproximately 8 million tons of CO  during the minimum project life of 20 years. \n2\n \n(vi)  The proposed loan, which will provide long-term, fixed-interest rupee financing, \nwill  offer  the  best  possible  solution  to  the  Borrower  under  current  market \ncircumstances.  The  Borrower  values  such  long-term,  fixed-interest  rupee \n                                                 \n16 Group of 8. 2005. The Gleneagles Communiqu\u00e9. Gleneagles. \n ", "12  \nfinancing by ADB since such a product is not readily available in Indian financial \nmarkets. As all of GPEC\u2019s revenues are in Indian rupees, the rupee financing \nhelps avoid a currency mismatch between revenues and expenditures. The feed-\nin tariff for wind energy projects does not allow financing costs to be passed \nthrough. As such, the long-term, fixed-interest rate will increase stability of the \nProject\u2019s financing plan. This will also help to make wind energy generation a \n\u201cstand alone\u201d business, thereby encouraging more investments by Indian and \nforeign utilities. \n \nC.  Anticorruption  Policy,  and  Combating  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of \nTerrorism \n \n45.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  and  Combating  Money \nLaundering and the Financing of Terrorism Policy (2003) were explained to GPEC. Consistent \nwith its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will require \nGPEC to maintain and comply with internal procedures and controls following international best \npractice standards for the purpose of preventing corruption or money laundering activities or the \nfinancing of terrorism; and covenant with ADB to refrain from engaging in such activities. The \nfinancing documentation between ADB and GPEC will further allow ADB to investigate any \nviolation or potential violation of these undertakings. \n \nVII.  INVESTMENT LIMITATIONS \n \n46.  Once approved, the proposed loan of up to Rs4.45 billion to GPEC will represent 2.6% of \nADB\u2019s nonsovereign operations\u2019 portfolio. The proposed loan is within ADB\u2019s aggregate country, \nindustry, group, and single-project exposure limits for nonsovereign investments.  \n \nVIII.  ASSURANCES \n \n47.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \nGovernment will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed assistance to \nGPEC. No funding will be disbursed until ADB receives such confirmation. ADB will enter into \nsuitable documentation, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, following approval of the \nproposed financing by the Board of Directors. \n \nIX.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n48.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan of up to \nRs4,450,000,000  denominated  in  Indian  rupees,  without  government  guarantee,  to  Gujarat \nPaguthan  Energy  Corporation  Private  Limited  for  the  Samana  Wind  Power  Project  and  the \nSaundatti Wind Power Project from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with a term of up to 13 \nyears, with an availability period of 15 months, an interest rate to be determined based on the \nprocedures applicable to ADB local currency loans for private sector operations, and such other \nterms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in this report, and as \nmay be reported to the Board.  \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n19 March 2008 \n ", "    Appendix 1  13\n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING AND DEVELOPMENT EFFECTIVENESS FRAMEWORKS \n \nTable A1.1: Design and

Growth of Generation Capacity \n \n1.  As the Indian power sector has grown, India has become increasingly dependent on \nfossil fuels. With recent continued and sustained hikes in oil and gas prices, as well as the \nexpected  shortages  of  fossil  fuels  in  the  future,  the  security  of  India\u2019s  energy  supply  is \ngenerating increasing concern. The environmental concern over excess use of fossil fuels is \nalso rising. In this context, India urgently needs to explore sustainable energy development, and \nthe Government has been working proactively to promote use of renewable energy sources. \n \n2.  Among the renewable power resources available in India, wind energy is a promising \nsource for further development. India has 45,000 megawatts (MW) of gross potential, assuming \n1% of land availability for wind power generation in the potential areas. Sites with annual mean \nwind density exceeding 200 watts per square meter are considered suitable for wind power \nprojects, and 216 such sites have been identified in the country by the Center for Wind Energy \nTechnology (C-WET). The states with the largest number of sites include Tamil Nadu (41), \nGujarat (38), Andhra Pradesh (32), Maharashtra (31) and Karnataka (26). However, India\u2019s \ntechnical potential is limited to only about 13,000 MW, assuming 20% grid penetration, which \nwill rise with the augmentation of grid capacity in potential states. As of September 2007, India \nhad installed wind power capacity of over 7,700 MW, ranking the country fourth in the world \nafter Germany, Spain, and the United States. While the 10th Five Year Plan targeted a 2,200 \nMW increase of installed wind power capacity, over 5,400 MW has been installed.1 The installed \nwind power capacity and gross potential in India by state is provided in Table A2. \n \nTable A2: Installed Wind Power Capacity and Potential in India by State \n(MW) \nAs of  As of  As of \nState  Gross Potential \n31 March 2005  31 March 2006  30 September 2007 \nAndhra Pradesh  120.5  121.0  121.0  8,275 \nGujarat  253.5  338.1  828.0  9,675 \nKarnataka  410.8  584.6  903.0  6,620 \nKerala  2.0  2.0  2.0  875 \nMadhya Pradesh  28.9  40.3  71.0  5,500 \nMaharashtra  456.2  1,001.3  1,620.5  3,650 \nRajasthan  284.8  358.1  494.0  1,700 \nTamil Nadu  2,034.9  2,892.5  3,662.5  5,400 \nWest Bengal  1.1  1.1  1.6  3,050 \nOthers  1.6  1.6  1.6  450 \nTotal  3,594.3  5,340.6  7,705.2  45,195 \nMW = megawatt. \n Source: Ministry of New and Renewable Energy. \n \n3.  Both Gujarat and Karnataka are leading states in wind resources availability (with gross \npotential of 9,675 MW and 6,620 MW respectively), as well as in wind generation capacity (with \ninstallations of 828 MW and 903 MW respectively).

New Delhi. \n ", "18     Appendix 2 \nB.  Regulatory Framework for Wind Power in India \n \n4.  The Government is proactively encouraging development of renewable energy sources. \nThe Government\u2019s efforts to promote renewable energy started in the early 1980s after the first \nand second global oil price shocks. The Government created the Commission for Additional \nSources of Energy in 1981 and Department of Non-Conventional Energy Sources in 1982. The \nDepartment of Non-Conventional Energy Sources was transformed into the Ministry of Non-\nConventional Energy Sources (MNES) in 1992, and then was renamed the Ministry of New and \nRenewable Energy (MNRE) in 2006. The National Electricity Policy, issued by the Ministry of \nPower in 2005, contains a major thrust toward the development of renewable energy sources. \nMNRE is the nodal ministry in the Government for all matters relating to new and renewable \nenergy. Its main functions include (i) policymaking and planning, (ii) program formulation and \nimplementation,  (iii)  research  and  development,  (iv)  technology  development  and \ncommercialization, (v) promotion of demonstration and pilot projects, and (vi) implementation of \nfiscal and financial incentives. \n \n5.  The MNES (now MNRE) established the Centre for Wind Energy Technology at Chennai \nas an autonomous research and development institution of the Government and as a technical \nfocal point for India\u2019s wind power development. The center provides developers with technical \nservices, including wind resource assessment for project sites, testing and certification services \nfor equipment, and training and capacity-building services. \n \n6.  Technological advancements are gradually increasing the commercial viability of wind \npower projects. The replacement of old 250-kilowatt wind turbines at a height of 30 meters (m) \nwith 1-MW units at 50 m height has made wind power more attractive as an investment. Higher \nwind power density due to increased height, lower installation cost per MW, and less land \nrequirement make a case for choosing higher unit size of wind turbines. India\u2019s advantage is \nthat wind turbines of 1 MW and above are being manufactured in the country. \n \n7.  Fiscal and financial incentives provided by the Government and the state governments \nhave traditionally driven the development of wind power projects in India. The incentives being \nprovided by the Government include (i) 80% accelerated depreciation of project costs for wind \npower  projects;  (ii)  concessions  or  full  exemption  on  customs  duties  of  certain  imported \ncomponents of wind turbines; (iii) tax holiday for a maximum of 10 consecutive years within 15 \nyears of commissioning, which is available for infrastructure projects; and (iv) concessional \nloans  available  through  Government-owned  agencies,  including  Indian  Renewable  Energy \nDevelopment Agency Limited, Power Finance Corporation Limited, and Rural Electrification \nCorporation Limited.  \n \n8.  Recently, the focus of the regulatory framework for the renewable energy sector has \nchanged from being driven by supply to being driven by demand. The Electricity Act, 20032 \nrequires all state-level energy regulatory commissions to ensure that electricity distributors \nprocure a specified minimum percentage of power generation from renewable energy sources. \nThe midterm appraisal of the 10th Five Year Plan by Planning Commission (footnote 1) included \nthe following recommendations for the renewable energy sector: \n \n                                                 \n2  Section 86 of the Electricity Act, 2003 states: \u201cThe State Commission shall discharge the following functions, \nnamely:\u2026(e) promote cogeneration and generation of electricity from renewable sources of energy by providing \nsuitable measures for connectivity with the grid and sale of electricity to any person, and also specify, for purchase \nof electricity from such sources, a percentage of the total consumption of electricity in the area of a distribution \nlicense;\u2026\u201d \n ", "    Appendix 2  19\n(i)  switch incentives and support from the supply-driven programs to demand-driven \nprograms and technologies; \n(ii)  explore alternative subsidy structures that encourage utilities to integrate wind, \nsmall hydroelectric, cogeneration, etc., into their systems; \n(iii)  phase out capital subsidies linked to the creation of renewable capacity in favor \nof subsidies linked to renewable energy generated; \n(iv)  state electricity regulatory commissions should mandate the purchase of energy \nfrom renewable sources, as per the provisions of the Electricity Act; and \n(v)  improve coordination and synergize the programs of MNES (currently MNRE) \nwith similar programs of other central ministries and state governments. \n \nC.  Wind Power in Gujarat \n \n9.  Gujarat has a long coastline and certain inland areas that have significant potential for \nwind energy generation. As of 30 September, 2007, the total installed wind power capacity in \nthe state of Gujarat was 828 MW against a total gross potential of 9,675 MW and a technical \npotential of 1,780 MW. Significant potential therefore exists for further wind generation in the \nstate. About 50 sites have been declared to have potential as wind farms on the basis of long-\nterm data on wind speeds collected under the aegis of MNRE. The first demonstration wind \nfarm was set up in the state in 1986 at the Okha coast, followed by a few more wind farms with \na combined capacity of about 16 MW. The satisfactory performance of these wind farms led to \nthe announcement of an incentive scheme in 1993, as per which the sector was opened up for \nprivate sector participation. Under this scheme, wind farm capacity of about 150 MW more was \nset up during 1993\u20131998. In 2002, the state government declared a new wind power generation \npolicy. However, the tariff envisaged under this policy (Rs2.60 per kWh) was not considered \nenough of an incentive to attract any significant investment in this sector. \n \n10.  In August 2006, the GERC announced an order to bring into effect a new renewable \nenergy policy.3 This policy covers wind energy, and envisages the following: \n \n(i)  a full-project life PPA with a term of 20 years would be signed between GUVNL \nor other distribution licenses and the power generator prior to commissioning of \nthe plant; \n(ii)  a fixed, levelized tariff of Rs3.37 per kWh for the entire tenor of the PPA; \n(iii)  25% of CDM benefits to be shared with GUVNL; \n(iv)  PPA to provide for a \u201cmust-run\u201d status covering the entire offtake of the wind \nfarms, thus envisaging shutdowns only under explicit emergency situations; \n(v)  a  minimum  percentage  of  GUVNL\u2019s  total  energy  purchase  (known  as  the \nrenewable purchase obligation, RPO) has to be from renewable energy sources. \nThe  RPO  has  been  set  at  1%  for  FY2009,  to  be  increased  to  2%  during            \nFY2010\u2013FY2012.  \n \n11.  In June 2007, the government of Gujarat released a new Wind Power Policy\u201420074 to \naccelerate investment in the sector. The policy will remain in effect until June 2012, and all wind \nturbine generators installed and commissioned before that date would be eligible for various \nincentives declared under the policy. The policy allows (i) captive use and third-party sales of \npower; (ii) 4% of energy fed into the grid as wheeling charges; (iii) exemption from payment of \n                                                 \n3 GERC. 2006.

Wind Power in Karnataka \n \n12.  Karnataka is one of the leading states in wind energy generation in India with a gross \npotential of about 6,600 MW. As of 30 September 2007, Karnataka had an installed wind \ngeneration capacity of 903 MW. Significant potential therefore exists for further wind generation \nin the state. The Karnataka Renewable Energy Development Limited (KREDL) is the nodal \nagency  responsible  for  promoting  renewable  energy  generation  in  the  state.  KREDL  also \noperates as the primary agency for promoting wind power in the state. \n \n13.  The KERC has passed various regulations from time to time to encourage wind power \ngeneration in the state. In accordance with the tariff policies issued by the Government, the \nKERC  issued  the  Power  Procurement  from  Renewable  Sources  by  Distribution  Licensees \nRegulations dated 27 September 2004 (the RPO regulations). Under the RPO regulations, each \nof the four distribution licensees (now five) in the state must purchase a minimum of 5% and a \nmaximum of 10% of the total electricity consumption in its area of supply from renewable \nsources. KERC had reserved the right to review the RPO policy every 3 years. With the first     \n3-year  period  expiring  in  October  2007,  the  government  of  Karnataka  concluded  that  the \nmaximum  limit  prescribed  by  the  KERC  might  be  an  impediment  to  the  development  of \nrenewable energy projects. The government of Karnataka has therefore, by an order dated 2 \nMarch 2007, opined that the RPO be enhanced to 20% in light of the fact that the maximum limit \nprescribed by the RPO regulations has already been achieved or will be achieved shortly. The \nKERC has since heard the order in October 2007 and an order to this effect is awaited. \n \n14.  KERC, by an order in January 2005, stipulated a tariff of Rs3.40 per kWh without any \nescalation for the first 10 years of operations for wind power projects in the state. In August \n2005, the KERC also approved a standard PPA to be executed between the generator and the \ndistribution licensee. The salient features of the model PPA include: \n \n(i)  a term of 20 years; \n(ii)  fixed, non-escalable tariff of Rs3.40 per kWh for the first 10 years of the PPA; \ntariff beyond the first 10 years to be determined by KERC; \n(iii)  no sharing of CDM benefits with distribution licensees; and \n(iv)  \u201ctake-and-pay\u201d provision, allowing for a \u201cmust-run\u201d status and qualification as a \nbase load generating station that is not subject to merit-order dispatch. \n \n \n \n ", "       Appendix 3  21\nGUJARAT PAGUTHAN ENERGY CORPORATION PRIVATE LIMITED \n \nA.  Overview \n \n1.  Gujarat Paguthan Energy Corporation (GPEC) was set up in 1992 under the name of \nGujarat Torrent Energy Corporation Limited as a joint venture between the Torrent Group of \nIndia (46%), Powergen of UK (28%), the government of Gujarat (12%), and Siemens AG \n(14%). In 2002, Powergen purchased the stakes of the other three entities in the joint venture. \nIn June 2003, Powergen divested its entire equity stake in favor of the CLP Group. GPEC is a \ncompany that owns and operates a single asset: a 655 megawatt (MW) gas-fired combined-\ncycle power plant at Paguthan, near Bharuch in Gujarat. The combined-cycle power plant has \nbeen operational since 1997 and sells its entire electrical output to the Gujarat Urja Vikas \nNigam Limited (GUVNL) under a long-term PPA, which in turn sells it to four distribution \ncompanies in Gujarat. Along with the acquisition of GPEC, the CLP Group also acquired the \nownership of Powergen India Pvt. Ltd. (now renamed CLP Power India Private Limited, or \nCPIPL), the operations and maintenance (O&M) arm of Powergen.  \n  \nB.  Ownership, Management, and Corporate Governance \n \n2.  The CLP Group has 100% ownership of GPEC through an offshore holding company \nstructure. GPEC has 728 million fully paid-up shares, of which 99.99% are held by CLP Power \n(GPEC) Limited, a Mauritius entity. The remaining 0.01% of GPEC shares are held by CPIPL, \nwhich is also 100% owned by the CLP Group. CPIPL has been converted into the business \ndevelopment arm of the CLP Group in India besides continuing to play the role of the O&M \noperator for the Paguthan plant. Given that both GPEC and CPIPL are 100% owned by the CLP \nGroup, it is likely that these two entities will be merged in the near future, subject to required \nlender and statutory approvals. \n \n3.  The CLP Group, founded in 1901 as China Light and Power Company Limited in Hong \nKong, China, is one of the leading investor-owned power utilities in Asia. It is a conglomerate of \ncompanies with a portfolio of over 30 generation assets and retail businesses in different \ncountries in the Asia-Pacific region. The group has investments in over 30,000 MW gross \ngeneration  assets.  The  group  holding  company,  CLP  Holdings  Limited  (rated  A  [negative \ncreditwatch]/A-1[negative creditwatch] by Standard & Poor\u2019s/Moody\u2019s), is listed on the Hong \nKong Stock Exchange and had a market capitalization of approximately $19 billion as of 31 \nJanuary 2008. The Group registered total revenues of $5.8 billion in 2006 and earnings of $1.3 \nbillion.  In  Hong  Kong,  China,  CLP  operates  a  vertically  integrated  electricity  generation, \ntransmission,  and  distribution  business,  with  an  installed  capacity  of  6,908  MW  and  a \ntransmission capacity of 12,000 kilometers. CLP supplies electricity to approximately 80% of the \npopulation in Hong Kong, China. The utility is operated by CLP Power Hong Kong Limited under \na regulatory regime created through a scheme of control agreement (SOC) with the government \nand accounts for over 80% of CLP Holdings\u2019 operating cash flow. There has been a recent \nchange in the regulatory arrangements under the SOC, which envisages a lower permitted \nreturn to the utility, which in turn could limit its ability to raise debt financing and affect its \ncommitment to provide cleaner and stable power to Hong Kong, China. Standard and Poor\u2019s \nand Moody\u2019s have therefore placed CLP Holding\u2019s credit rating on negative creditwatch for a \npotential downgrade.  \n \n4.  GPEC is CLP\u2019s first investment in India. In future, CLP proposes using GPEC as its \ninvestment vehicle for all of its wholly owned projects in India. In addition to GPEC, CLP also \nhas a presence in India through Roaring 40s, a joint venture between the CLP Group and Hydro \n ", "22   Appendix 3 \nTasmania, which has recently financed a 50.4 MW wind farm in the state of Maharashtra. GPEC \nis strategically important to the CLP Group and it derives strong management, technical, and \nfinancial support from its parent. GPEC\u2019s top management is nominated by CLP\u2019s board and \nGPEC\u2019s managing director is a part of the CLP group\u2019s senior management team. GPEC is \nmanaged by nine directors on its board, of which seven represent the CLP Group and two \nrepresent local financial institutions. Mr. Rajiv Mishra, the managing director of the company, \nhandles the day-to-day management of GPEC under the supervision and control of the board of \ndirectors. As of 30 June 2007, the company had 119 employees.  \n \n5.  The CLP Group has a well-established code on corporate governance and policies. The \ncode  applies  to  directors,  officers  and  employees  of  CLP  Holdings,  its  wholly  owned \nsubsidiaries, and joint ventures or companies in which CLP holds a controlling interest. In the \ncase of joint ventures or companies in which CLP does not hold a controlling interest, the CLP \nrepresentatives concerned are expected to act in accordance with the code themselves and to \ndo everything possible to influence those with whom they are working to ensure that they also \nact  to  similar  standards  of  integrity  and  ethical  behavior.  The  CLP  corporate  governance \nframework lays down procedures applicable to enforcement of shareholder rights, activities of \nthe board and board committees, management and staff, and auditors. Eight board committees \nhave  been  created  to  oversee  various  aspects  of  the  board\u2019s  operations,  including  audit, \nremuneration, social, environmental, and ethics-related issues. In addition, the CLP Group has \nformulated a number of policies including a fair disclosure policy, guidelines on related-party \ntransactions, an anti-fraud policy, and procurement values and principles. As a fully owned \nsubsidiary of the CLP Group, GPEC is also obligated to adhere to the principles enunciated by \nthe CLP Group. \n \nC.  Operational Performance \n \n6.  The Paguthan plant is located about 10 kilometers from Bharuch in Gujarat state. The \npower plant consists of 3 Siemens V94.2 gas turbines, 3 heat recovery steam generators, and \none steam turbine generator. The power is evacuated to the Gujarat Electricity Transmission \nCompany Limited (GETCO) substations through a switchyard owned by GPEC. The power plant \nhas shown a strong operating performance since inception and has consistently achieved plant \navailability exceeding or close to 90%, while keeping forced outages at extremely low levels. \nThe power plant is a critical source of power for the state of Gujarat and accounts for about 8% \nof the state\u2019s total power needs. GPEC\u2019s operations and maintenance strategy has focused on \nmaximizing plant availability, ensuring operational safety, and optimizing maintenance costs. \nCritical maintenance activities such as hot gas path inspections have been regularly carried out \nin accordance with recommendations of the equipment suppliers.  \n \n7.  GPEC adopts the CLP Group\u2019s environmental and social safeguard policies and has \nestablished and efficiently implemented its safety, health, and environment (SHE) policy through \na system and procedures based on international best practices. In addition, GPEC also initiates \nand implements community health and education development projects in consultation with the \nbeneficiary communities. GPEC\u2019s SHE performance is exemplary considering its ISO 14001 \ncertification (since 1999), several awards related to SHE received over the years, accidental \nrates below the industry norm, full compliance with all applicable national SHE regulations, \neffective waste management, well-established SHE management systems and procedures, staff \ntraining on a continuing basis, and staff participation in the SHE management. There are no \noutstanding issues related to resettlement and there are no tribal communities living in the \nvicinity of the power plant area. \n \n ", "       Appendix 3  23\n8.  GPEC is conscious of its social responsibility toward the communities within which it \noperates.  In  September  2000,  GPEC,  under  its  corporate  social  responsibility  initiative, \nestablished The Paguthan Power Plant Social Development Trust with the aim of upgrading, \nstrengthening, and empowering the rural communities surrounding the plant. The trust takes up \nactivities that benefit the community as a whole, and it focuses on education, health, and \nenvironmental awareness programs covering 10 surrounding villages. Some of these activities \nare now extended to major parts of the Bharuch district.

Gujarat Paguthan Energy Corporation Private Limited (GPEC) has executed a contract \nwith Enercon (India) Limited (EIL), a leading wind turbine manufacturer in India, to develop the \n100.8 MW Samana and 82.4 MW Saundatti wind farm projects and its facilities on a turnkey \nbasis. The Samana and Saundatti wind farms are expected to be completed by January 2009 \nand June 2009, respectively. \n \n2.  This summary of initial environmental examination (SIEE) is based on comprehensive \nenvironmental impact study reports1 for Samana and Saundatti wind energy projects and has \nbeen prepared for the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in line with its environmental and social \nsafeguards policies and information disclosure requirements for category B projects. Under the \nMinistry of Environment and Forest (MOEF) Notification S.O. 1533 dated 14 September 2006 \nenvironmental clearance is not required for this proposed capacity of wind power project as \nsuch projects in India are categorized as green projects.  \n \nB.  Description of the Project \n \n1.  Project Scope \n \n3.  The  Project  involves  construction,  operation,  and  maintenance  of  the  Samana  and \nSaundatti wind power generation facilities. Technical parameters designed for the proposed \nprojects are presented below: \n \nTable A4.1: Technical Parameters \n \nTechnical Parameter  Samana  Saundatti \nNo. of Wind Turbine Generators (WTG)  126   103 \nRequired Area per WTG  0.5 hectare  0.5 hectare \nTotal Area Required  234 acres  135 acres \nPower Generation Capacity  100.8 MW  82.4 MW \n(0.8 MW per WTG) \nHub height   74 m  74 m  \nWTG Model  Enercon 53 (E-53)  Enercon 53 (E-53) \nNo. of Blades  3 blades  3 blades \nRotor Diameter  53 m  53 m  \nExtreme Wind Velocity  57 m/sec  57 m/sec \nAverage Wind Velocity  7.5 m/sec  7.5 m/sec \nMW = megawatt, m = meter, m/sec = meter per second. \nSources: Environmental impact study reports for Samana and Saundatti Wind Energy Project. \n  \n4.  The E-53 model is designed and manufactured by Enercon GmbH of Germany. The \nsalient features of E-53 are: (i) that each turbine is directly coupled with the generator and no \ngearbox  is  required,  thus  minimizing  maintenance  work;  (ii)  it  has  \u201ccutout  wind  speed \ntechnology\u201d that protects the wind turbine during storm conditions of wind speed of 28\u201334 \nm/sec; and (iii) it has high-efficiency blades with root spoilers and winglet tips to extract more \nenergy from the same swept area and that reduces the noise from the blade tips. \n                                                 \n1 TCE Consulting Engineers Limited. 2008.

For Samana wind farm, the power generated will be evacuated from the substation \nconstructed by EIL near Sadodar village, which in turn is connected to the Gujarat Electric \nTransmission  Co.  (GETCO)  substation  through  a  220  kV  line.  At  Saundatti,  the  power \ngenerated will be evacuated by substation to be constructed by EIL near Goravanakolla village \non the south ridge of the project site. Each wind farm development will include the following: \n \n(i)  construction of an unpaved access road from the highway to the wind farm, \n(ii) construction of internal service roads branching out from the main access road to \nindividual wind turbine generators (WTGs), \n(iii) erection of WTG towers for Samana and Saundatti, \n(iv) construction of substations at Samana and Saundatti, and \n(v) installation of supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system to serve all \nthe proposed WTGs per wind farm. The SCADA system and the substation will be \noperated and maintained by EIL for GPEC. \n \nC.  Description of the Environment \n \n1.  Project Location and Topography \n \n6.  The Samana wind farm is located in Samana Taluka, 72 km from Jamnagar in Gujarat. \nThe nearest airport is about 82 km from the proposed project site. The project site is 10 km from \nthe National Highway (NH-8B) connecting Jamnagar to Rajkot. The site is located on a long and \nhilly ridge 150\u2013215 meters above mean sea level. The area is dry, barren, and uninhabited with \nmany rock outcrops. The soil is poor, mainly sand and silts, and thus has no agricultural value. \nThe area has no natural water sources, and can sustain only desert thorny bushes and shrubs.  \n \n7.  The Saundatti wind farm is located near Saundatti Taluka, about 80 km from Belgaum in \nKarnataka. The nearest airport is 85 km from the proposed project site. The site is located on a \nlong and low hill ridge with heights varying from 210 to 240 meters above mean sea level. The \narea is barren and uninhabited with many rock outcrops. Soil is poor, yellow soil with gravel, and \nthus has no agricultural value. The area has no known historical or cultural sites. The area \ncovers both forest land and privately owned land, although the land has no agricultural value \nand is not inhabited. \n \n2.  Physical Environment \n \n8.  The Samana wind farm is in the Saurashtra basin, Gujarat, which consists of mostly \nMesozoic  and  Cenozoic  rocks.  The  area  has  no  known  commercial  deposits  of  mineral \nresources and supports only rock quarrying. The wind farm and its surrounding areas below the \nhill ridge are comprised of arid land with annual rainfall of 579 mm. The recorded relative \nhumidity varies between a maximum of 75.4% and a minimum of 28.2%. The predominant wind \ndirections during the study period were from the east, northeast, and east-northeast, accounting \nfor about 45% of the total time with calm wind speed less than 2.0 m/sec for about 24.5% of the \ntime. The recorded maximum and minimum wind speeds were 2.5 m/sec and 0.2 m/sec. Air \ntemperatures range from 12.6oC to 30.5oC.2 The area has poor soil with high sand and silt \ncontent (sand 31%\u201340% and silt 49%\u201358%). There are no natural water resources in the wind \nfarm  area.  However,  the  surrounding  areas  below  the  wind  farm  have  some  surface  and \n                                                 \n2 Meteorological station was established at proposed project site at Kalyanpur during December 2007 to record \nvarious meteorological parameters such as wind pattern (hourly basis), temperature variation, and relative humidity. \n ", "26   Appendix 4 \ngroundwater resources.  \n \n9.  The  existing  ambient  air  quality  status  has  been  monitored  at  six  locations  for \nsuspended particulate matter (SPM), respirable particulate matter (RPM), sulfur dioxide (SO ), \n2\nnitrogen  oxides  (NO ),  and  carbon  monoxide  (CO).  Results  show  that  all  the  parameters \nx\nmonitored are well within the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for residential \nand rural areas.3 Noise level monitoring was carried out at six locations and the results showed \nthat all monitored noise levels at all locations were found to be within the prescribed limit of \nNAAQS in respect of noise. \n  \n10.  The Saundatti wind farm is in Belgaum district, which is rich in mineral resources such \nas iron, manganese, bauxite, clay, limestone, sand, building stones, etc. The wind farm area is \nbarren land with no significant vegetation and is characterized by its poor yellowish soil with \nembedded rocks and gravels. At the district level, the climate is tropical with air temperatures \nvarying from 11oC to 38oC and an average total rainfall of 1,476 millimeters. However, the wind \nfarm area is on the dry side of Belgaum district with low rainfall. As the wind farm is on hilly \nterrain, it has no natural surface water resources. However, the surrounding areas below the \nwind farm have some surface and groundwater resources. \n \n11.  The predominant wind directions during the study period were from the west, south-\nwest, south-southwest, and west-southwest, accounting for about 71.4% of the total time with \ncalm wind more than 2.0 m/sec for about 2.8% of the time. The recorded maximum and \nminimum wind speeds were 3.0 and 0.2 m/sec. Air temperature varies between minimum of \n14.0oC  and  a  maximum  31.2oC.4  The  existing  ambient  air  quality  (AAQ)  status  has  been \nmonitored at five locations for SPM, RPM, SO , NO  and CO. Results showed that all the \n2 x\nparameters monitored are well within the NAAQS for residential and rural areas. Noise level \nmonitoring was carried out at five locations and the results showed that all monitored noise \nlevels at all locations were found to be within the prescribed NAAQS. \n \n3.  Biological Environment \n \n12.  The Samana wind farm area is poor in biological resources. The areas classified as \nforest land in the surrounding areas immediately below the hill ridge are covered with degraded \nforest, thorny bushes, and shrubs. No large trees are visible apart from trees planted in villages \nin the surrounding areas. There are no wildlife sanctuaries, reserve forests, or bird sanctuaries \nwithin the vicinity of the wind farm area.  \n \n13.  The  vegetation  of  Belgaum  district  is  of  two  types.  The  moist  type  occurs  in  the \nsouthwestern portion where the district touches the crest line of the Western Ghats. The second \nis the dry type found towards the east of Belgaum city and stretches from the northern areas \naround Athani, Chikodi, and Gokak right down to Sampagaon and Saundatti in the south. The \nmoist vegetation is sustained by heavy seasonal precipitation from the southwest monsoon, \nwhich is active from June to October. There are no wildlife sanctuaries, reserve forests, or bird \nsanctuaries within the immediate vicinity of the study area. \n \n14.  According to the Zoological Survey of India, there is no specific domestic migration path \nof birds in Gujarat. The Khijadia bird sanctuary is 83 km from the proposed Samana wind farm \n                                                 \n3 The ambient air quality results also meet the World Bank standards for ambient air emissions. \n4 Meteorological station was established at proposed project site at Saundatti in January 2008 to record various \nmeteorological parameters such as wind pattern (hourly basis), temperature variation and relative humidity. \n ", "       Appendix 4  27\nsite. \n \n4.  Socioeconomic Environment \n \n15.  Human resettlements are found only in the surrounding areas below the hilly range \nwhere the wind farms will be located. There are 30 and 18 villages found in and around Samana \nand Saundatti project sites, respectively. In Samana, most of the population is dependent on \nraising groundnuts, cotton, and livestock. In Saundatti, most of the total population depends on \nagriculture and raising livestock.  \n \n16.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement. The total land to be acquired for the Samana \nProject will be about 234 acres. The land will be acquired in about 126 locations, of which 63 \nlocations  are  degraded  forest  land  and  the  balance  63  locations  will  be  predominantly \ngovernment land. Private land, if required for setting WTGs, will be acquired on willing-buyer-to-\nwilling-seller basis through negotiations between the owners and EIL. As the private land is not \ninhabited and not used for economic and social activities, its use for the erection of WTG towers \nwill not create adverse social impacts or economic losses. \n \n17.  The total land to be acquired for the Saundatti Project will be about 135 acres. Of the \n103 WTGs under the Saundatti Project, 64 WTGs are on forest land and 39 WTGs on private \nland. EIL will seek approval from the government of Karnataka under the Forest Conservation \nAct 1980 to use the required forest land under a lease agreement. The use of degraded forest \nland will not restrict access to forest resources, if any, of any communities living in the vicinity of \nthe wind farm area. Private lands will be acquired through private negotiations between EIL and \nthe owners based on willing-buyer-to-willing-seller basis. If negotiations with any particular land \nowners are not successful, alternative locations will be considered.  \n \n18.  Indigenous Peoples. There are no indigenous peoples (scheduled tribes) living close to \nor within the sites identified for the Samana and Saundatti wind farms. No restrictions in access \nwill be imposed on degraded forest land. The sites are vacant, and there are no archeological, \nhistorical, or religious sites in the project areas. \n \nD.  Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \n1.  Impacts During Construction \n \n19.  The  construction  of  the  two  wind  farms  involve  only  minor  civil,  mechanical,  and \nelectrical  works  taking  place  on  several  small  areas  scattered  over  a  wide  area.  The \nconstruction  activities,  particularly  road  construction,  will  create  some  small  and  transient \nenvironmental disturbances such as noise, gaseous emissions, and dust from trucks and heavy \nequipment. No groundwater will be tapped for domestic and construction work. The water \nrequired for construction will be purchased from municipal sources and the reverse osmosis \nplant at the EIL concrete tower fabrication (CTF) factory in Sadodar. Solid waste generated \nduring road construction and excavation will be used for embankment of the road and minor \nleveling  of  site  during  site  restoration  after  construction.  However,  these  environmental \ndisturbances will not create significant social or ecological impacts. \n \n2.  Impacts During Operation \n \n20.  During operation, the WTGs do not generate gaseous and dust emissions. Therefore, air \npollution is not an issue. The WTG towers erected thus far have not created adverse visual \n ", "28   Appendix 4 \nimpacts since the hill ridge on which the wind farms are located is not known for its natural \nbeauty. Noise contribution to background noise will be the bare minimum, and will not have \nsignificant impact on either surrounding ambient noise quality or ecology. The wind turbines will \nalso not endanger migratory birds or bats as there are few in the wind farm areas. The turbine \ndesign minimizes flickering effects of turbine rotation. \n \n21.  Transformers used at each WTG tower and the substation will be of forced-oil and \nforced air cool design, which do not use polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB). EIL will strictly adhere \nto regulations regarding air traffic and safety relevant to tall WTG towers. As per air navigational \nmarking regulations, the upper section of the towers and turbine blades are marked with red \nbands of a specific width for visibility. Blinking lights have been provided as per the navigational \nmarking regulations for visibility and clear identification at night. Hence, no impact is expected \non air traffic or safety. The region in which the wind farms are located has experienced seismic \ntremors ranging from 2.0 to 6.8 Richter scale. Therefore, the WTGs and towers as well as other \nbuildings  will  be  designed  with  appropriate  safety  factors  to  withstand  the  lateral  ground \nmovement caused by seismic shocks.  \n \n22.  Both direct and indirect temporary employment, for both casual and skilled labor, will be \ngenerated during construction period. The existing culture and health of the local populations \nwill not be affected as the construction period will be very short. \n \nE.  Institutional Requirements and Environmental Management Plan \n \n1.  Organizational Structure, Roles, and Responsibilities \n \n23.  As EIL is responsible for the construction, operation, and maintenance of the WTGs, \nsubstation  and  SCADA  system,  it  will  be  responsible  for  environmental  management  and \nmonitoring  of  the  Project.  GPEC  will  ensure  that  EIL  will  comply  with  all  regulations  and \nconditions  for  the  various  operating  permits.  The  environmental  management  plan  (EMP) \npresents  the  potential  impacts,  the  corresponding  mitigating  measures,  timeframe  and  the \nresponsible parties to implement the EMP. \n \nF.  Public Consultation and Disclosure \n \n24.  Formal consultation sessions have been held by GPEC and were attended by selected \nstakeholders,  including  representatives  from  local  gram  panchayats  (mostly  village  heads, \nsarpanches), local residents, and representatives of equipment suppliers to solicit their views on \nthe Project and its environmental and social aspects. EIL has conducted many awareness \ncamps on the wind energy projects covering various settlements in the vicinity of the project \narea  to  inform  local  communities  about  the  wind  energy  project.  Local  communities  have \ndemonstrated good understanding of the nature and scope of wind energy projects. They have \nbeen assured that the wind farms would have no significant environmental and social impacts. \nHowever, they hoped the wind farm would create economic opportunities for the communities, \nand that the project sponsor would provide assistance in community development, particularly \ndrinking water, health, and education.  \n ", "    Appendix 4  29\nG.  Findings and Recommendations  \n \n25.  The IEE findings lead to the conclusion that the Project, being a wind energy project on \nmarginal land with no economic and ecological value, is unlikely to cause any significant, lasting \nenvironmental or social impacts. The perceptible environmental impacts are noise and visual \nimpacts, but both are considered to be moderate at most given the considerable setback of \nturbines to the nearest settlements and the landscape values of the site. The environmental \ndisturbance normally associated with construction activities will be minimized through an EMP, \nimplementation of which will continue during project operation and which includes monitoring \narrangements. \n \nH.  Conclusions \n \n26.  It is concluded that the IEE is adequate to justify environmental and social clearance of \nthe Project. There is no need for further analysis and the environmental and social assessment \nof the Project is considered complete. \n \n ", "  3\n0\n   \n  A\nTable A4.2: Environmental Management Plan  p\np\ne\n  n\nd\nImplementing  ix\nEnvironmental Issue  Mitigation Measures  Time Frame   4\nParty   \nConstruction vehicle on  During \nSprinkling of water to control fugitive dust emissions.
