There is a demand from developing member countries (DMCs) for (i) building knowledge \nand capacity in new and emerging areas, (ii) supporting quick adoption of new technologies \nbeing developed and tried across the region and the globe, and (iii) facilitating knowledge \nsharing in the region. While some middle-income countries have managed to create pockets of \ncapacity in new and emerging areas\u2014including science and technology\u2014the vast majority of \nthe Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) DMCs have severe capacity deficits in these areas1. \nEven  middle-income  countries  face  a  wide  knowledge  gap  in  some  new  and  emerging \ntechnologies that are highly relevant to their future development. Further, regional knowledge \nexchange  is  currently  not  very  effective  and  scattered  around  the  region.  The  proposed \ntechnical assistance (TA) will help build capacity on identified new and emerging development \ntopics in DMCs,2 thus enhancing the skills and expertise in DMCs and strengthening knowledge \nsharing in these areas. This TA responds to DMCs\u2019 demands and ADB\u2019s operational needs. The \nTA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.    \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Modern  economies  are  characterized  by  a  complex  interplay  of  competition  and \ncollaboration between economic actors. The contribution of competition to economic efficiency \nand productivity is intuitively easier to grasp. But some key determinants of growth in modern \neconomies involve the acquisition of new and emerging technologies. This requires generation \nand adoption of scientific knowledge and new technologies, the pursuit of innovation, and the \ndevelopment of the necessary human resources. This also requires extensive collaboration and \nnetworking with relevant parties across the region and the world. Recent analyses, including the \nOrganisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development  (OECD)  Growth  Study:  Some \nImplications for Statistics3 and the United Nations World Investment Review4, have identified \nthese as powerful factors that drive economic growth. These data show a strong correlation \nbetween the percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) spent on research and development \nand  GDP  per  capita\u2014underscoring  the  increasing  importance  of  new  knowledge  and \ntechnology for development. There is wide understanding that the Asia-Pacific region needs to \nbecome innovative and technologically more advanced if it is to continue the high growth rates \nseen over the last few decades. The Asian Development Outlook 20035 identified knowledge as \nthe most important resource in maintaining the Asia and Pacific region\u2019s competitiveness, given \nthe rapid rate of change created by globalization and technological innovation.  \n \n3.  In light of the above, ADB must assume a more proactive role as catalyst6 of applied \nknowledge in the region, which is critical for the future development of its DMCs. While new \nknowledge and technologies are being developed successfully in different countries and regions, \na key challenge facing DMCs is to capture and translate this international knowledge into locally \nuseful knowledge. There is a need to develop knowledge hubs in the region to make available \nand disseminate identified new basic and applied knowledge of relevance to DMCs. These \n                                                 \n1  Millenium Project 2005. Report of the Task Force on Science, Technology and Innovation. New York.

Further, \nthese knowledge hubs should become key reservoirs of relevant expertise and serve as main \nagents of dissemination of such knowledge in DMCs and the region.  \n \n4.  These knowledge hubs should aim to mainstream new concepts in innovation, science, \ntechnology, management development, and related fields for the region. They should also \npromote improved exchange of data, information, and knowledge; and increase the capabilities \nof institutions and organizations in the region. Initiatives have created a wealth of knowledge \nbase and expertise throughout the region. However, the capabilities of regional organizations \nand institutes in disseminating and sharing their findings are limited. Information is not enriched \nthrough regional cooperation, and information and expertise bases largely remain scattered \naround the region and fail to provide the multiplier effect that could be achieved if it were \nnurtured with more support for regional knowledge exchange. As the knowledge hub will focus \non new development topics, experience and lessons learned from ADB knowledge sharing \ninitiatives such as the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) center \nof excellence will be applied in the establishment of the knowledge hubs. \n \n5.  The proposed TA will create such knowledge hubs and have a crosscutting impact on \nregional knowledge and information exchange, and sharing of knowledge and information in \nareas demanded by DMCs. The creation of knowledge hubs will help strengthen ties among \nleading intellectuals and officials around the region, and will aid the long-term development of \nbasic  research  and  technology  information  exchange  around  the  region.  This TA  will  also \nsupport  ADB\u2019s  Knowledge  Management  Framework 7  (particularly  output  5)  to  expand \nknowledge sharing, learning, and dissemination of innovations through external relations and \nnetworking. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The TA aims to support regional development by supporting knowledge hubs in selected \nDMCs as centers of excellence to (i) promote germination or growth of identified knowledge and \ntechnologies, (ii) translate or adopt national and international knowledge in these areas for local \nuse, (iii) reduce domestic knowledge and skill gaps in these areas, and (iv) promote exchange \nof knowledge and information. In particular, the TA will focus on areas that are operationally \nrelevant to ADB such as environment, transport, and energy. Through these knowledge hubs, \nthe TA will (i) introduce the latest knowledge and advanced technologies in identified areas \nneeded in selected DMCs or across the region; and (ii) support the creation of a pool of experts \nin  those  areas,  which  will  continue  to  serve  the  DMCs  concerned  and  the  region.  These \nknowledge hubs will improve ADB\u2019s networking in the region and enhance its ability to respond \neffectively to DMCs\u2019 needs by providing reliable and relevant knowledge and information, along \nwith a pool of experts in these new areas.  \n \n7.  These knowledge hubs will provide decision makers and the development community in \nAsia and the Pacific with up-to-date knowledge products and services tailored to client or \nregional  needs.  The  process  aims  to  mobilize  resources  to  (i)  improve  the  creation  and \ndissemination of knowledge about distinct value-adding topics; (ii) provide access to specific \ninformation resources; and (iii) establish centers of excellence with particular emphasis on a \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2004.

It will promote regional cooperation in the \ncreation  and  dissemination  of  knowledge,  and  recommend  regional  solutions  to  meet \ndevelopment challenges. \n \n8.  This regional TA will build knowledge and capacity in specific development topics and \nhelp increase understanding and awareness in new and emerging sectoral and thematic trends. \nIt will strengthen ADB\u2019s partnerships with development institutions and academia. In particular, \nknowledge hubs will offer briefings on new and emerging development concepts and issues, \nand create knowledge products and services in formats suitable for use in the region and in \nADB operations. It will foster knowledge communities throughout the Asia-Pacific region and \nprovide learning opportunities on key development topics where ADB\u2019s financial assistance is \nmade  available  for  DMCs.  These  knowledge  hubs  will  be  integrated  into  ADB\u2019s  lending \noperations and knowledge management activities, and will support and complement its training \nand course offerings. They will also be linked to ADB\u2019s communities of practice (CoPs) to \nenhance their access to region-wide operational issues. Overall, these knowledge hubs will \nsupport DMCs in their development efforts and enhance ADB\u2019s ability to respond to their needs \nmore effectively. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA will identify about four to six (maximum) organizations and institutions in the \nregion to serve as knowledge hubs for identified and focused development topics relevant to \nDMCs and ADB operations. Knowledge hubs can be created in one or two specific fields with \nrelated sub-hubs established in other countries. Countries identified as knowledge hubs should \nhave  the  technical  skills  and  capability  to  undertake  the  activity.  The  identification  of  the \ndevelopment topics, and the organization or institutions to serve as knowledge hubs will be \nmade by ADB through internal consultation among relevant departments and CoPs, the Asian \nDevelopment Institute (ADBI), and consultations with DMCs and other stakeholders. \n \n10.  These knowledge hubs will deal with emerging development concepts and technologies, \nsuch  as  clean  development  mechanisms,  use  of  compressed  natural  gas  and  hybrid \ntechnologies in the transport sector, renewable energy, environmental technology,  information \nand communication technology, as well as management techniques. The knowledge hubs will \naddress common development concerns or assist in problem solving in specific sectors or \nareas. To ensure high synergy and knowledge sharing, these knowledge hubs will be linked \nwith each other\u2014as well as with relevant national organizations\u2014individually. Moreover, to \npromote regional cooperation and integration, they will collaborate with existing knowledge \nnetworks in the region. Further, they will be linked to international academic and research \norganizations to enhance their access and capacity to learn and adapt the latest international \ndevelopment concepts to regional or local needs and demands. ADB will serve as the nodal \npoint for coordination of the activities of these knowledge hubs located in different DMCs. It is \nenvisioned that knowledge hubs will focus on new and emerging development concepts that will \nbe introduced and integrated as one of the activities of the identified \u2018hub\u2019 organization or \ninstitution. As a frequent and regular activity of the organization, it is expected that the concept \ndeveloped out of the knowledge hub can be sustained within the business environment upon \ncompletion  of  this  TA.  As  they  develop,  the  knowledge  hubs  are  envisioned  to  operate \nindependently as part of an Asian applied knowledge network. The key output of the TA will be \nrecognizable  regional  or  national  knowledge  hubs  on  selected  development  topics  of  high \nrelevance  to  DMCs  and  ADB.  The  TA\u2019s  output  will  also  include  knowledge  products  and \n ", "4   \nservices such as toolkits, methodologies, good practices, dissemination through workshops and \npublications, and an established network of such organizations and institutions with ADB.   \n \n11.  The knowledge hubs will undertake research and disseminate new concepts of interest \nto ADB\u2019s clients. They will also facilitate sharing of development related topics within and \nbeyond the Asia-Pacific region. The knowledge hubs will collaborate with development actors \nand stakeholders in providing new and constantly updated content to its users. Since each \nknowledge hub will be dedicated to a specific development area or topic, it will build research \ncapacity to create knowledge in the area, liaise with academic institutions, and deliver specific \nknowledge outputs to satisfy the clients\u2019 needs. \n \n12.  ADB  assistance  will  include  provision  of  technical  support,  capacity  building  of  the \nidentified organizations or institutions, and facilitating exchange of information. In this process, \nADB will not build a new organization or institution; rather, it will support existing organizations \nand institutions in the region to build and expand their capacity for knowledge generation, \nknowledge capture, and research efforts to translate national and international knowledge for \nlocal or regional use, and knowledge dissemination in identified areas.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $990,000 to be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA \nfunding program. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements   \n14.  ADB  will  be  the  executing  agency  of  the  TA.  The  Regional  and  Sustainable \nDevelopment  Department  (RSDD)  will  be  the  nodal  department  for  implementation  of  TA \nactivities. RSDD will implement the TA activities, including the identification of the knowledge \nhubs, in collaboration with the regional departments (RDs) and ADB\u2019s CoPs. Overall supervision \nand guidance for implementation of the TA will be provided by a steering committee led by \nRSDD, comprising representatives of relevant ADB departments, particularly the RDs.  \n \n15.  About 30 person-months of international individual consultants, with selected expertise \nin the identified areas or themes of the knowledge hubs, will be required under this TA, with \neach  knowledge  hub  requiring  about  5\u20136  months  of  consultancy  work.  The  international \nconsultants  will  be  responsible  for  (i)  preparing  draft  agreements  with  organizations  and \ninstitutions  identified  as  knowledge  hubs  under  the  TA;  (ii)  providing  necessary  technical \nsupport,  undertaking  studies,  and  building  capacity  (including  training  of  experts  in  these \norganizations and institutions); and (iii) reviewing the activities and outputs of these knowledge \nhubs. In addition, the TA will require 35 person-months of domestic individual consultants to \nprovide  research  and  data  analysis  support  to  the  knowledge  hubs.  The  outline  terms  of \nreference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. The consultants will be engaged by ADB in \naccordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory \nto ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. \n \n16.   The activities under the TA will include organizing consultation and technical workshops, \nas appropriate, to disseminate and help mainstream developments and new findings generated \nfrom  the  knowledge  hubs.  The  analytical  outputs  of  the  knowledge  hubs  during  TA \nimplementation will be compiled as knowledge products and made available to all DMCs as a \npublication.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  24  months,  starting  from  January  2006  to \n ", "  5\nDecember 2007. TA activities will be monitored and reports made available through the ADB \nwebsite. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n17.
