INTRODUCTION\n1. The Concept Clearance Paper for the Coastal and Marine Resources Management and\nPoverty Reduction technical assistance (TA) in South Asia was approved by the Regional\nTechnical Assistance Screening Committee (RSC) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in\nDecember 1999.1 The ADB Fact-Finding Mission visited Bangladesh, India, Maldives, Pakistan,\nand Sri Lanka, and discussed the conceptual framework and potential scope of the TA with\npotential  beneficiaries  and  concerned  government  agencies,  nongovernment  organizations\n(NGOs),  the  World  Conservation  Union  (IUCN),  and  the  Colombo-based  South  Asia\nCooperative Environment Programme (SACEP). At the conclusion of the visit to each country,\nan  understanding  was  reached  regarding  the  objectives,  scope,  and  implementation\narrangements for the TA.2 The TA framework is shown in Appendix 1.\nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. India, Maldives, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka have extensive coastal and marine ecosystems\nthat have acquired regional and global significance on account of their diversity and species\nendemism. These ecosystems are vital habitats for a wide range of marine and coastal fauna\nand flora. The spectacular, biodiversity-rich coral reefs in the Maldives and parts of India are\nsome of the best reef systems in the entire Indian Ocean. The southern coastal belt of Sri Lanka\nis an important nesting ground for five species of the globally threatened marine turtles, and the\nIndus Delta in Pakistan has some of the most extensive mangrove forests in the region. The\nSouth Asian region of the Indian Ocean also provides the habitat for a diversity of marine\nmammal species including whales, dolphins, and the globally endangered dugong (sea cows).\nMarine turtles, whales, and dolphins often migrate across political borders and are therefore a\nshared resource in the  region.\n3. Population growth in South Asia has been higher than in most regions of the world. A\nsignificant  percentage  of  the  population  lives  in  coastal  areas.  The  impact  of  increased\npopulation  and  associated  human  activities,  combined  with  inadequate  infrastructure  and\nmanagement capacity, places heavy pressure on the coastal and marine resource base. The\nresource base is threatened by increased levels of domestic and transboundary marine pollution\n(mainly  from  land-based  activities,  maritime  shipping,  and  transport);  coral  bleaching;\nunregulated tourism; siltation; and unsustainable extraction of marine and coastal resources,\nincluding mangroves. These problems cause concern not only at the national but also the\nregional level.\n4. The coastal areas in the region are the sole source of subsistence and livelihood for\nmillions of people living, mostly below the poverty line, in coastal communities. Environmental\nmismanagement in the coastal areas has resulted in severe pollution, depleting the coastal\nwaters of aquatic life to the extent of the elimination of some species and depriving the poorest\nof the poor of their only source of income, which is fishing in the coastal waters. The over-\nexploitation of aquatic resources (both in the coastal and marine areas) consequent to the\nintroduction  of  mechanical  fishing  devices,  large  boats  (including  trawlers),  and  advanced\ncomputer-based  technologies  in  offshore  areas  has  adversely  affected  the  income-earning\nopportunities of the poor fisher folk and subjected them to continued exploitation by middlemen\nand  money  lenders.  Without  concerted  efforts  relating  to  development  and  the  effective\n                                                \n1 Subsequently, the scope of the regional TA was revised in view of funding limitations, resubmitted to the RSC,\nand approved in December 2000.\n2  The TA was first listed in ADB Business Opportunities in January 2000.", "2\nenforcement of policies and strategies to restore coastal and marine resources to sustainable\nlevels and prevent their further degradation, the coastal communities will continue to suffer the\nhardships consequent to reduced income, poor health and sanitation, and limited educational\nopportunities for their children.\n5. There  is  no  dearth  of  information  regarding  the  problems,  issues,  constraints,  and\nopportunities in sustainable development and management of coastal and marine resources.\nGiven the economic and ecological significance of these resources, they have been the subject\nof a large number of studies, including those conducted under ADB-assisted projects in Sri\nLanka.3 While these studies have identified problems, issues, and constraints, they are silent on\nhow to integrate sectors, institutions, capacities, and community-based approaches into the\nmanagement of coastal and marine resources.\n6. A lack of coordination among the large number of institutions mandated with developing\ncoastal and marine resources is a common feature of the region, and a factor constraining the\nsustainability of coastal and marine resources. Institutional indifference due  to the ambiguity of\njurisdictions  has  in  many  cases  resulted  in  counterproductive  and  conflicting  development\nactivities. Collaborative partnerships among  concerned institutions mandated by legislation may\nbe  an  option  for  addressing  the  institutional  quagmire.  Institutionally  neutral  national  and\ninternational  NGOs  would  be  in  a  unique  position  to  facilitate  the  development  of  such\ncollaboration.\n7. As a global conservation institution established in 1948, IUCN plays a lead role in the\nconservation arena globally, acting as a strong voice for states, governments, and NGOs.\nToday, IUCN has more than 950 members spread across 140 countries. The institution has a\ndemonstrated  commitment  to  conservation  in  the  region  and  significant  experience  in\nconservation and management of natural resources, including  coastal and marine resources.\nFor example, IUCN Pakistan has over 15 years of experience in the management of coastal and\nmarine resources. The institution has similar experience in Sri Lanka, which leads the regional\ncoastal and marine ecosystems management program. IUCN programs include biodiversity\nconservation, environmental assessment, environmental education and communication, and law\nand economics. Despite its limited resources and the immensity of its programs in the region,\nIUCN has a qualified team of professionals, linked to global networks, with access to IUCN\u2019s\nexpertise  across  the  world.  IUCN\u2019s  commitment  at  the  international  and  national  levels  to\nconservation,  and  its  experience  in  national  initiatives,  will  be  of  immense  value  in  the\ndevelopment  of  region-wide  strategies  that  entail  cooperation  and  collaboration.  IUCN\u2019s\ncollaboration with ADB in the area of coastal and marine resources management and poverty\nreduction will serve the overall goals of both institutions and will set a precedent for meaningful\ncooperation in ADB\u2019s other conservation efforts.\n8. While  there  are  similarities  in  the  problems,  issues,  and  constraints  affecting  the\nmanagement  of  coastal  and  marine  resources  throughout  the  region,  there  are  significant\nvariations among the countries on the understanding of the coastal and marine resources; level\nof  development  assistance;  and/or  strategies  for  resource  conservation,  sustainable\ndevelopment, and management. This variability has the potential to act as an incentive for the\ncountries in the region to benefit from one another\u2019s knowledge, experience, and technology to\npromote the sustainable development of coastal and marine resources. Bangladesh, with ADB\u2019s\n                                                \n3  TA 3271-SRI: Sustainable Natural Resources Management for Development; approved on 6 October 1999, for\n$800,000; and Loan 1716-SRI: Coastal Resources Management Project, approved on 7 December 1999, for $40\nmillion.", "3\nassistance,  has  undertaken  a  major  investment  in  the  Sundarbans,  the  country\u2019s  most\nsignificant coastal area from a socioeconomic and ecological point of view, using an integrated\napproach. While no specific investments are targeted in Bangladesh under this TA, the lessons\nlearned from the Sundarbans project will be of immense value to other countries in the region.\nSignificant information and experience of mutual benefit to countries in the region is available in\nIndia, Maldives, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. Kerala has been included within the scope of the TA\nas it is the third Indian state selected for priority assistance by ADB (after Gujarat and Madhya\nPradesh) and has one of the region\u2019s highest population densities along its coastal areas.\n9. Coastal and marine resources in South Asia are crucial to sustaining coastal economies\nand,  if  properly  managed,  can  serve  as  a  sustainable  source  of  national  income  through\nappropriate levels of harvesting as well as nonconsumptive uses such as ecotourism. The\ncoastal and marine resources of South Asia are being rapidly degraded due to economic forces\nas well as weaknesses in policies, regulations, and information; a multiplicity of institutions and\nambiguities in their jurisdictions; and a lack of collaborative and integrated approaches. A\nregion-wide approach to stemming this rapid degradation is appropriate because many of these\nresources are shared among the participating countries, and the degradation of these resources\nin one country can have serious economic and environmental ramifications for neighboring\ncountries. Given the commonality of issues across the region and the different experiences in\ndealing with them, cooperation in the development of appropriate strategies and approaches will\nbenefit all the countries. IUCN is in a unique position to help develop a common understanding\nby  facilitating  the  sharing  of  knowledge  and  experience  in  developing  and  implementing\nintegrated coastal zone management (ICZM) strategies with the dual objectives of ensuring\nappropriate environmental management and reducing poverty. The TA will identify and pilot test\nthe  approaches  to  promote  the  protection  of  ecologically  sensitive  coastal  and  marine\nresources, poverty reduction interventions, and regional cooperation.\nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.  Objectives\n10. The overall objective of the TA is to promote regional cooperation among the participating\ncountries  in  strengthening  management  of  environmentally  sensitive  coastal  and  marine\nresources using ICZM approaches. In particular, in each participating country, the TA aims to (i)\nhelp  formulate  strategies  for  regional  cooperation  in  ICZM  development  planning,  capacity\nbuilding, and information exchange; (ii) identify ecologically sensitive geographical areas requiring\npriority investment support; and (iii) develop appropriate ICZM strategies to develop and manage\nthe areas identified under (ii) and pilot test such strategies at selected sites. Because most coastal\ncommunities are poor and depend on coastal resources for subsistence, the strategies under (iii)\nwill address the environment-poverty link by targeting the poor.\nB.  Scope\n11. The scope of the TA will include the development of a regional strategic plan. The plan\nwill include recommendations for regional cooperation and collaboration including mechanisms\nfor information exchange, database development and management, and capacity building using\ninstitutions of excellence within the region. At the national level, it will include (i) identification of\nhigh priority geographical areas (HPAs) of the highest environmental and ecological significance\nand sensitivity; (ii) analysis of policy, institutional, regulatory, and other constraints that act as\nbarriers  to  effective  and  efficient  collaborative  approaches  to  ICZM,  and  opportunities  to\naddress such constraints; (iii) a strategy for the application of ICZM approaches in the HPAs", "4\nthat addresses constraints; and uses opportunities and (iv) an estimate of the required financial,\nhuman resource, and other needs to implement the strategy with suggestions for possible\nfunding  mechanisms.  Pilot  projects,  aimed  at  testing  ICZM  strategy  through  collaborative\ninstitutional arrangements, as developed under the strategy, will be implemented in selected\nHPAs with the participation of poor coastal communities, to provide replicable ICZM models.\nResults from the pilot projects will be used to further refine and strengthen the strategy.\nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n12. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $920,000. The estimate includes consulting\nservices, counterpart inputs, materials, equipment, scientific studies, regional seminars and\nworkshops, office space, and transportation. ADB will provide $600,000, on a grant basis, which\ncomprises $450,000 from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan and\n$150,000 from ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund resources. IUCN in Pakistan and Sri\nLanka and its regional directorate in Bangkok will provide technical staff resources, office space,\nand equipment in Bangkok, Karachi, and Colombo, and other facilities in kind, estimated at\nabout $260,000. The counterpart agencies in India, Maldives, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka will\ncontribute office space (where necessary), local travel and remuneration of counterpart staff,\nand the use of equipment, estimated at a total of $60,000 equivalent. Detailed cost estimates\nand a financing plan are presented in Appendix 2.\nD. Implementation Arrangements\n13. The  TA  will  be  executed  by  ADB.4  TA  implementation  agreements,  defining  the\nobjectives, scope, implementation arrangements, cost estimates, and financing plan, will be\nsigned with each participating country prior to the implementation of the TA in that country.\nImplementation  will  be  carried  out  over  an  18  month  period  after  the  TA  implementation\nagreements have been signed by the participating countries. The TA will be jointly implemented\nby ADB and IUCN, through its regional directorate in Bangkok. Field activities in Maldives,\nPakistan, and Sri Lanka will be carried out through the country offices of IUCN, in collaboration\nwith the counterpart agencies. The Indian component of the TA will be implemented by the\nMinistry of Environment and Forests (MOEF) of Kerala state, under the overall direction of the\ncentral Government\u2019s MOEF.\n14. The regional directorate of IUCN will be responsible for coordinating and monitoring\nimplementation, arranging and conducting regional workshops and seminars, and submitting\nregular quarterly progress reports to ADB. The regional directorate will also provide overall\nquality control supervision to ensure that implementation is carried out efficiently, effectively,\nand in accordance with international norms and standards. ADB and IUCN will enter into a\npartnership agreement on terms and conditions acceptable to ADB prior to the commencement\nof the TA. (Appendix 3 shows IUCN\u2019s profile).\n15. The head of IUCN\u2019s Regional Coastal and Marine Programme, based in Colombo, will\nact as the regional coordinator and provide the necessary technical guidance and support in\ncarrying  out  day-to-day  activities  including  liaison  and  coordination.  To  facilitate  regional\ncooperation, the SACEP office will be invited to participate in regional meetings and assist in the\ndevelopment of regional strategies. IUCN will provide the required administrative support in\nimplementation, at the regional and country levels. The regional coordinator will be responsible\nfor coordination and liaison of activities with the implementing agency or agencies in India and\n                                                \n4  Environment Division of the Office of Environment and Social Development.", "5\nits Kerala state. SACEP\u2019s national focal points will be responsible for national coordination and\nsupport. Linkages between the focal points and national organizations will be ensured through\nelectronic media, meetings, workshops, and newsletters.\n16. International  consultants  (9  person-months)  and  domestic  consultants  (60  person-\nmonths), financed by ADB, will support the IUCN team in the designated countries, and the\nimplementing agency in India. Individual international consultants will be engaged by ADB in\nconsultation with IUCN and in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.\nIndividual domestic consultants will be engaged by IUCN for Maldives, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka\nwith  the  prior  approval  of  ADB  and  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic\nconsultants.  For  the  India  component,  individual  consultants  will  be  selected  by  ADB  in\nconsultation with IUCN and the MOEF in Kerala state, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on\nthe Use of Consultants and other satisfactory arrangements for the engagement of domestic\nconsultants. An outline terms of reference for consulting services are outlined in Appendix 4.\n17. An inception report will be prepared by IUCN and discussed at a regional workshop\nwithin two months of the beginning of the TA. The regional directorate of IUCN, Bangkok, will\nestablish a web site for the TA in the first month of implementation. Confirmation and definition\nof participating countries\u2019 data and information sharing will be secured prior to the workshop. An\ninterim report summarizing the progress and outlining the continuing work program will be\ndiscussed in an interim workshop within nine months of the start of the TA. A final workshop to\ndiscuss the final report will be in the twelfth month of implementation. ADB resident missions in\nIndia, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka will be encouraged to participate in the regional and national\nworkshops and other activities.\n18. ADB, in consultation with the IUCN regional directorate, will monitor and periodically\nreview the progress of the TA through (i) quarterly progress reports; (ii) at least three review\nmissions,  particularly  to  review  the  inception,  interim,  and  draft  final  reports;  and  (iii)\nparticipation in regional workshops. A Steering Committee will be set up at ADB headquarters to\noversee  TA  implementation  and  monitor  progress.  The  Committee  will  be  chaired  by  the\nManager  of  Environment  Division  (ENVD),  and  include  representatives  from  Agriculture\nDepartment (West), Programs Department (West), and Consulting Services Division. All draft\nreports will be posted on the web site for comments by the participating countries and ADB,\nprior to their finalization.\n19. ADB will be responsible for procurement of equipment and materials it is financing under\nthe TA. ADB may, however, agree on arrangements with the regional directorate of IUCN, or as\notherwise appropriate, to carry out procurement satisfactory to ADB and in accordance with\nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.\nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION\n20. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the\nprovision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of\n$600,000  for  the  purpose  of  Coastal  and  Marine  Resources  Management  and  Poverty\nReduction in South Asia, and hereby reports such action to the Board.", "Appendix 1, page 1\n6\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK\nDesign Summary Targets Monitoring Risk/Assumptions\nMechanisms\n1.

Through the Union\u2019s six expert commissions, a global network of some 9,000\ntechnical,  scientific,  and  policy  experts  make  a  massive  volunteer  contribution  to\nconservation  by  maintaining  a  regular  flow  of  information  and  expertise.  The  six\ncommissions  are:  ecosystem  management,  education  and  communication,\nenvironmental economics and social policy, environmental law, the Species Survival\nCommission, and the World Commission on Protected Areas.\nB. IUCN in Asia\n4. As one of the leading conservation organisations in the region IUCN brings\nstates and civil society together in a neutral forum, that is not constrained by political\nboundaries  and  conflicts.  IUCN  works  across  Asia  in  the  following  countries\u2014\nBangladesh,  Bhutan,  Brunei,  Cambodia,  Republic  of  China,  East  Timor,  India,\nIndonesia,  Japan,  Republic  of  Korea,  Democratic  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Korea,  Lao\nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic (PDR), Malaysia, Maldives, Mongolia, Myanmar, Nepal,\nPakistan, the Philippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Viet Nam. By actively\ndeveloping and initiating regional and subregional initiatives such as a Mekong River\nproject in Lao PDR, Thailand, and Viet Nam, IUCN plays a prominent role in facilitating\ntransboundary collaboration on conservation issues. IUCN\u2019s membership in the region\ninclude 11 states, 23 government agencies, and 95 NGOs.\n5. The Asia Regional Directorate, Bangkok, is the management body of the IUCN\nSecretariat charged with leading the Secretariat program in Asia. It is chaired by regional\ndirector, and is composed of all country representatives and heads of regional programs,\na  director  of  constituency  development  and  coordination,  a  director  of  program\ndevelopment and coordination, a director of finance and human resources, and the head\nof  monitoring  and  evaluation.  The  regional  programmes  span  a  wide  range  of\nconservation  related  themes  like  biodiversity,  sustainable  use,  environmental\nassessment, forests, environmental law, marine, wetlands and freshwater resources.\n(Reference in text: page 4; para 14)", "Appendix 3, page 2\n12\n6. IUCN\u2019s Asian regional office is headed by a full time regional director. The role of\nthe Asian regional office is to support country offices and regional programs through an\nintegrated  approach,  which  sparks  synergy  and  harnesses  all  resources,  including\nintellectual capital towards cost-effectiveness. A regional finance and human resources\nunit is responsible for the development and management of integrated financial and\nhuman resource systems utilized by the country offices and regional programs. The\nconstituency development and coordination programme proactively works to strengthen\nconstituency  relationships  at  the  regional  level  while  paying  special  attention  to\nmembership in those countries where no IUCN secretariat is in place. With the support\nfrom the regional monitoring and evaluation programme the processes and systems for\nintegrated program planning, resource mobilization, and monitoring and evaluation are\ncontinuously improved.\n7. Six  country  offices  build  and  maintain  the  national  base  and  serve  as  the\nincountry hub for activities in the following countries. Bangladesh, Lao PDR, Nepal,\nPakistan, Sri Lanka, and Viet Nam. A country representative heads each country office.\nIn  Cambodia,  IUCN  operates  a  project  office.  Enhancing  this  national  scope  has\ninvolved  the  expansion  of  the  program  and  the  development  of  a  much  more\ncomprehensive portfolio of work, a definition of country programs in consonance with\ncountry commitments to national strategies and international conventions (especially the\nConvention on Biological Diversity), and restructuring and management. Most country\noffices are headed by national representatives and staffed by an increasing number of\nnational and regional staff.\nC. Regional Coastal and Marine Program, Asia\n8. Under the Asian regional office structure, the coastal and marine programme in\nAsia  was  established  in  1999.  The  establishment  of  the  programme  was  done  in\nrecognition of the increased national focus on marine and coastal conservation and the\nneed for a consolidated and regional approach to conservation of marine and coastal\nresources.\n9. The objectives are to\n(i) Contribute to IUCN\u2019s global goals, objectives,and outputs;\n(ii) Contribute to IUCN Asia\u2019s goals, objectives, and outputs;\n(iii) Assure policy and technical linkages to global partners and debates;\n(iv) Develop strategic alliances at the regional level;\n(v) Organize regional networks around key programme technical themes;\n(vi) Mobilize resources and provide management;\n(vii) Contribute to regional program development and implementation;\n(viii) Develop and manage regional projects;\n(ix) Support the development of country programs;\n(x) Influence and test policy; and\n(xi) Communicate lessons and experiences.\n10. A strategy was prepared in 1999, serving as the initial basis for the establishment\nof the new regional program. The strategic process is built on extensive consultations\nwithin  IUCN  as  well  as  with  members,  partners,  and  donors.  It  also  took  into\nconsideration the global marine policy \u201cCreating a Sea Change\u201d developed recently by", "Appendix 3, page 3\n13\nIUCN and World Wide Fund for Nature a guiding framework policy for IUCN\u2019s coastal\nand marine work and ongoing national activities with a regional significance.\n11. The overall vision and goal of IUCN\u2019s coastal and marine program in Asia is to\nencourage  and  facilitate  the  conservation  of  coastal  and  marine  biodiversity,  while\nensuring the sustainable use of coastal and marine resources. The main objectives of\nthis program are to\n(i) Strengthen  the  effective  management  of  critical  ecosystems  through  the\nconservation of biodiversity and maintaining and/or enhancing socioeconomic\nbenefits.\n(ii0 Promote  development  and  implementation  of  integrated  coastal  zone\nmanagement approaches.\n(iii) Promote and demonstrate that use of renewable coastal and marine resources\ncan be sustainable.\n(iv) Assist  in  establishment  of  an  effective  management  system  of  Marine\nProtected Areas.\n(v) Assist in the conservation and management of coastal and marine species,\nincluding control of alien invasive species.\n(vi) Enhance the knowledge base and contribute to the effective communication\nabout coastal and marine issues.\n12. The program has identified six main thematic areas: (i) critical ecosystems, (ii)\nintegrated  coastal  zone  management;  (iii)  sustainable  use  of  coastal  and  marine\nresources; (iv) marine protected areas, (v) species\u2014threatened, migratory and invasive;\nand (vi) information and awareness. These thematic areas complement one another and\nas such will not be developed on an exclusive basis, but will use potential linkages\nbetween  thematic  areas  and  synergies  provided  by  member  and  partnership\narrangements. The program will also draw upon the support of relevant commissions,\nand regional and national programs and initiatives.\n13. The Asian regional office policy is to locate regional programs and staff in country\noffices so as to spread expertise more evenly throughout the region. With an established\nand well-consolidated national coastal and marine programme, the regional program is\nnow based in the country office of Sri Lanka. Hence, it also serves an important function\nof  integrating  and  linking  national  and  global  initiatives  on  marine  and  coastal\nconservation from the field implementation level to regional and global policy initiatives.\n14. Projects are currently being implemented in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka,\nand Viet Nam, mainly relating to planning, conservation and rehabilitation of mangrove\necosystems,  the  establishment  of  marine  protected  areas,  integrated  coastal  zone\nmanagement initiatives, and species-specific projects for marine turtle and cetacean\nconservation. These national projects serve as important lessons for building a strong\ncoastal  and  marine  program  in  the  regional  context.  Examples  of  projects  being\ndeveloped  also  address  coastal  resources  management  and  sustainable  tourism\ndevelopment in the People\u2019s Republic of China and a subregional development of a\nproject on critical ecosystems in South and Southeast Asia.", "Appendix 3, page 4\n14\nD. IUCN in the National Context\n1. Pakistan\n15. IUCN has been working in Pakistan since 1982. In 1983, the Government of\nPakistan  requested  IUCN  to  provide  support  in  the  development  of  a  national\nconservation strategy (NCS). The IUCN Pakistan country office was set up in 1985,\nwhen it carried out preparatory work for the NCS involving preliminary surveys; and\nconsultations  with  the  Government  of  Pakistan,  NGOs,  and  experts.  In  1987,  at\nGovernment of Pakistan\u2019s request, the project for the development of the NCS was\nbegun.  In  1992,  the  NCS  was  approved,  putting  Pakistan  in  a  leadership  role  in\nenvironment conservation in South Asia and beyond.\n16. In Pakistan, IUCN has 23 members, including 6 government agencies and 14\nNGOs. The activities and expertise of the members cover a wide spectrum ranging from\nnatural  resource  conservation  to  pollution  control,  sustainable  development  at  the\ncommunity level, environmental advocacy, and good governance. Recently, the IUCN\nmembers organized themselves into a Pakistan National Committee, serve as a unique\nforum for collaboration between the State and the civil society.\n17. The IUCN Pakistan Country Office is located in Karachi, with program offices in\nIslamabad and Peshawar and project offices in Chitral, Abbottabad, Gilgit, Skardu, and\nQuetta.\n18. IUCN Pakistan has long experience in working on the coast of Pakistan. The\nenvironmental knowledge of Pakistan\u2019s coastal resources is limited, but a significant part\nof what does exist is resident in IUCN. The organization is resolved to consolidate and\nstrengthen its coastal work. It recognizes that the challenge is gigantic for any one\norganization. An integrated and multidisciplinary approach is essential for ensuring the\nsustainability of coastal ecosystems while addressing the acute poverty prevailing in\ncoastal communities. IUCN Pakistan seeks to strengthen its existing partnerships, and to\nforge and facilitate new ones by continuing to support environmental leadership.\n2. Sri Lanka\n19. The incountry operational relationship between IUCN and the Government of Sri\nLanka  commenced  in  August  1988  with  the  establishment  of  the  country  office  in\nColombo.  The  presence  of  IUCN  in  Sri  Lanka  was  based  on  a  memorandum  of\nunderstanding signed with the then Ministry of Land and Land Development. In 1993,\nIUCN  and  the  Government  of  Sri  Lanka  signed  an  expanded  memorandum  of\nunderstanding, which consolidated the legal status of IUCN in Sri Lanka. Since then the\nactivities of IUCN Sri Lanka has expanded and moved into new areas in partnership with\nthe government and IUCN\u2019s NGO members and partners.\n20. IUCN Sri Lanka has to date enlisted 12 members, consisting of 4 government\nand  8  NGO  members.    State  membership  is  held  by  the  Ministry  of  Forestry  and\nEnvironment while the Department of Wildlife Conservation, the Forest Department and\nthe Central Environmental Authority constitute the government agency members. The 8\nNGO  members  are  the  Wild-Life  and  Nature  Protection  Society,  the  Environmental\nFoundation  Ltd.,  March  for  Conservation,  the  Sri  Lanka  Environmental  Journalists\nForum, the Sri Lanka Environmental Congress, Worldview Sri Lanka, Organisation to", "Appendix 3, page 5\n15\nSafeguard Life and Environment and the Organisation for Resource Development and\nEnvironment. The position of IUCN Sri Lanka is further strengthened by the presence in\nthe  country  of  members  representing  IUCN's  six  Commission,  notably  the  Species\nSurvival Commission, the Commission on Education and Communication and the World\nCommission on Protected Areas.\n21. With a number of projects under implementation and in the pipeline IUCN Sri\nLanka today has gradually built up a specific experience and interest in actively seeking\nto enhance conservation management in the coastal zone. Threats facing this important\nsection of Sri Lanka\u2019s biodiversity are still challenging, not only in terms of ecological\nqualities but also in trying to ensure sustainability through integrating the social and\neconomic  dimension.  Achieving  this  goal  requires  an  integrated  approach  and\nstrengthening  credible  and  broad-based  partnerships  and  by  forging  new  ones  by\ncontinuing to provide environmental leadership.\n3. India\n22. In India, the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MOEF) is represented as a\nState member of IUCN. In addition 3 other Government agencies and 11 Indian NGOs\nare members of IUCN. Even though IUCN does not maintain a country office in India, its\nactivities are implemented through its members and partners.  Accordingly, a national\ncommittee of all IUCN members have been formed. The Secretary MOEF acts as the\npresident of this body, which represents IUCN in India and assists in the implementation\nof it\u2019s activities in the country. Through the national committee as well as its individual\nmembers, IUCN has been involved in the implementation of a number of activities in the\ncountry. Through the Wildlife Institute of India, Indian Institute of Forest Management,\nand  G.B.  Pant  Institute  of  Himalayan  Ecosystem,  IUCN  is  implementing  various\nconservation activities under a project funded by Norwegian Agency for International\nCooperation (NORAD) project covering 5 Himalayan countries.  IUCN is also assisting in\nthe establishment of a National Environmental Impact Assessment Association in the\ncountry. The MOEF has taken a lead in the process.  IUCN has also been assisting in\nthe  establishment  of  a  national  consultative  group  on  the  implementation  of  the\nConvention on Biological Diversity and on the Center for Information on Conventions. It\nis also facilitating the publication of a document on India\u2019s bioregion. IUCN also co-\nsponsors and hosts South Asia component of the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network\nand  India is actively involved in it.\n23. At the invitation of the Indian Government (MOEF), IUCN held the last Regional\nConservation Forum in Delhi in March, 2000. The Government of India hosted this\nwidely attended regional activity  and covered most of the local costs form its own\nresources.\n4. Maldives\n24. The Government of the Maldives has invited IUCN to open an office in Male.\nIUCN is in the process of exploring possibilities of cooperation in coastal and marine\nresources monitoring and development planning.", "Appendix 4, page 1\n16\nOUTLINE TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR CONSULTANTS\nA. General\n1. The technical assistance (TA) will require approximately 9 person-months of international\nand 60 person-months of domestic consulting services. This will include short-term international\nexperts in the fields of integrated coastal and marine resources management (8 person-months)\nand  database/information  development  and  management  (1  person-month).  The  domestic\nexpertise will include a country coordinator (to be funded by the World Conservation Union [IUCN]\nin all participating countries except India, where the country coordinator will be funded by the TA.\nThe country coordinators will be assisted by domestic consultants with expertise: (i) integrated\ncoastal  zone  (including  marine  resources)  management  (ICZM);  (ii)  community\nparticipation/development;  (iii)  coastal  and  marine  institutions,  policy,  and  legislation;  (iv)\nbiodiversity  conservation  with  specific  reference  to  coastal  and  marine  resources;  and  (v)\neconomic and financial analysis.  The national coordinators will be responsible for the overall\ncoordination of all activities including analysis and review of existing information, identification of\nhigh  priority  geographic  areas  (HPAs)  of  highest  environmental  and  ecological  sensitivity,\ndevelopment of ICZM strategies, and implementation of ICZM strategies and approaches at the\npilot sites. The Head of IUCN\u2019s regional coastal and marine program based in Colombo, will act\nas the regional coordinator and provide the necessary technical guidance and support in carrying\nout day-to-day activities, including liaison and coordination. The required administrative support in\nimplementation, at the regional and country levels, will also be provided by IUCN. The regional\ncoordinator will be responsible for arranging and conducting workshops and seminars, and submit\nregular quarterly progress reports to the Asian Development Bank (ADB). He/she will provide\noverall quality control and supervision to ensure that implementation is carried out efficiently,\neffectively, and in accordance with international norms and standards. The detailed description of\ninternational and domestic consultant services and specific terms of reference for each consultant\nwill be provided by IUCN in the TA inception report. In addition, IUCN (Asia region) will be\nexpected to make arrangements for participation by representatives of international and national\nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  Bangladesh,  and  the  South  Asian  Cooperative\nEnvironment Programme, in various workshops and seminars, as appropriate.\n2. The ICZM strategies will be prepared for the HPAs in India\u2019s Kerala state, Pakistan,\nMaldives, and Sri Lanka. These strategies will be based on a review and analysis of all the\navailable  information  and  data  on  coastal  and  marine  resources,  policies,  legislation,  and\ninstitutions, and will include basic socioeconomic data, and information on the status of coastal\nand marine resources.\n3. While  the  exact  nature  and  extent  of  HPAs  and  the  strategies  for  their  sustainable\ndevelopment  and  conservation  will  be  dictated  by  the  findings  of  macro-level  assessments,\namong issues that may be addressed will be (i) participation by local communities in ICZM,\nincluding community preparation activities, such as capacity-building of local institutions;  and (ii)\ncoordination and collaboration, and institutional and regulatory structures, especially in relation to\ncoordination and collaboration between the concerned sectoral agencies. ICZM strategies and\napproaches will be tested at pilot project sites to help refine key policy, legal, procedural, and/or\ninstitutional frameworks that will evolve from the macro-level ICZM strategies.\n4. For selected pilot HPA sites, one each in India, Maldives, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka,\ndetailed site specific socioeconomic and biophysical resource information will be generated as a\nbasis for preparation and implementation of an ICZM strategy.

Detailed Tasks\n1. Review of Scope and Development of Work Program\n5. The team of consultants, led by the regional coordinator, will review the country-specific\nscope of activities and undertake an assessment of information needs and availability to achieve\nthe objectives of the TA and prepare an inception report that details the work program for\nimplementation.  The work program will specify the procedures and the methodology to achieve\nthe desired objectives, clearly defining the outputs, the activities and phased inputs that will be\nrequired. The work program will also provide detailed specifications and terms of reference for\neach international and domestic consultant and the schedule for their engagement, the timing of\nvarious seminars and workshops, the locations and scope of activities for pilot testing the ICZM\nstrategies in selected HPAs, capacity building programs, and other relevant details. It will identify\npossible options for regional cooperation in terms of information sharing and exchange, ICZM\ndevelopment planning, and capacity building.\n2. ICZM Strategies/Plans\n6. Following the identification of HPAs, ICZM strategies to promote sustainable development\nand conservation will be prepared for HPAs in India\u2019s Kerala state, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. The\nmajor tasks will include the following:\n(i)  Assemble, review, and analyze all the available information and data on coastal and\nmarine resources in Kerala state in India, Maldives, Pakistan (Sindh and Balochistan), and\nSri Lanka (including information available under ongoing activities). This information will\ninclude basic socioeconomic data, information on the present status of coastal and marine\nresources with respect to their present condition, management, vulnerability to physical", "Appendix 4, page 3\n18\nevents (typhoons, storm surges, etc.); coastal erosion; oil spill sensitivity; biodiversity\nresources;  fishery  resources;  and  existing  national  and  international  development\ninitiatives.\n(ii)  Review all available information pertaining to the quality of coastal waters with specific\nreference to (a) sources of pollution and magnitude of contaminants; (b) possible impacts\nof  contamination  on  human  health,  and  the  socioeconomic  well-being  of  the  coastal\ncommunities; (c) policies, legislation, rules, and regulations pertaining to environmental\nmanagement,  the  institutions  responsible  for  their  implementation  and  the  level  of\nenforcement,  their  adequacy  in  ensuring  effective  environmental  management  with\nspecific reference to coastal and marine pollution; and (d) environmental education and\nawareness programs.\n(iii)  Based on the above review and analysis (i, and ii), identify the HPAs for development of\nICZM  strategies  with  the  participation  of  local  communities  (in  identifying  HPAs,\nconsideration will be given to ensure representation of unique sites within the region).\n(iv)  Review  policy,  institutional,  regulatory,  and  other  constraints  that  act  as  barriers  to\neffective and efficient collaborative approaches to ICZM, and opportunities to address\nsuch constraints.\n(v)  Undertake an institutional analysis and mapping of institutional mandates to determine\ntheir  appropriateness  to  implement  ICZM  strategies  and  plans  and  identify  the  most\nappropriate lead agency.  This will also require clear definition of jurisdictions and specific\nrole in conservation, development, and management of coastal and marine resources.\n(vi)  Develop  an  ICZM  strategy  for  the  HPAs  in  each  participating  country  to  address\nconstraints and use opportunities. The objectives of such strategies will be sustainable\ndevelopment and conservation of coastal and marine resources, with the overall objective\nof poverty reduction, using an ecosystems approach with the participation of concerned\ncoastal communities. The strategies will include (a) the most appropriate arrangements for\nimplementation  through  collaborative  partnerships  among  agencies  responsible  for\nintegrated coastal and marine resources development and management; (b) appropriate\npolicy and legislative measures to ensure effective collaboration in the implementation of\nthe strategies including enforcement of policies, legislation, rules and regulations; these\nmeasures may include legally binding agreements between departments/agencies that\nclearly specify appropriate arrangements for channeling of development budgets, sectoral\nobligations, and transparent procedures for information sharing; (c) recommendations for\ninvestment at a prefeasibility level, along with cost estimates and implementation strategy,\nwith suggestions for possible funding mechanisms; (d) recommendations pertaining to\nappropriate  arrangements  to  ensure  governance,  transparency,  accountability,  and\neliminate political interference; and (e) potential for regional cooperation in information\nsharing and exchanges, data base development and management, and capacity building.\n(vii)  In consultation with the concerned institutions and on the basis of criteria agreed with the\ngovernment, select HPAs for detailed survey and assessment for implementation of pilot\nICZM  strategies  (at  least  one  HPA  in  each  participating  country).  This  may  include\nrepresentative survey of local communities and concerned local development institutions\nat the selected HPAs, in the form of an RRA, to supplement information gathered under\nactivities described in (i). The RRA will address the following major issues: (a) resource\nconservation and coastal protection, (b) income generation and economic development,", "Appendix 4, page 4\n19\n(c) social issues and physical infrastructure needs, and (d) mechanisms for community\nand NGO participation and involvement in ICZM implementation. The RRA teams will\ninform local people of the TA\u2019s objectives and scope, and indicate how local institutions\ncan be strengthened to ensure their meaningful input in the planning and implementation\nprocess;\n(viii)  On the basis of information and analysis carried out under (i to v), refine ICZM country\nstrategy to suit the specific conditions prevailing at the selected HPA pilot site. Field test\nthe  strategy  by  implementing  it  through  collaborative  institutional  arrangements,  as\ndeveloped under the strategy, with the participation of poor coastal communities. Results\nfrom the pilot projects will be used to further refine and strengthen the strategies for all\nHPAs in the participating countries.\n(ix)  Undertake  onsite  training  in  various  aspects  of  ICZM  for  the  local  communities  and\nconcerned staff at the HPA pilot sites by facilitating discussion group meetings and holding\nseminars  to  test  various  ICZM  approaches.  The  training  activities  will  give  particular\nattention to improving the participation of communities.\n(x)  Develop and establish a database on geographic information system (GIS) for the HPAs\nwith detailed information for at least one HPA, collected under (vii). The database will be\nlocated within the IUCN system and shared with an appropriate counterpart agency that\nhas either the necessary expertise or has the potential develop such expertise through\nongoing programs.\n(xi)  On  the  basis  of  the  above  information  prepare  a  draft  strategic  coastal  and  marine\nenvironmental management plan for the HPAs in each of the participating countries. The\nstrategic plan should take into account regional considerations for representative coverage\nof biogeographical units along the entire stretch of the coastal area in the region. Broadly,\nthe strategic plans should include descriptions of overall goals and objectives; policy,\ninstitutional, and regulatory requirements for successful implementation; proposals for\nspecific coastal resource management targets and the means to achieve them; guiding\nprinciples to be followed in implementation of the plan; indicative models to be used for\ndifferent components; recommended arrangements and guidelines for use of funds made\navailable; and implementation and monitoring arrangements. The guiding principles and\nindicative models will give particular emphasis to community involvement in planning and\nimplementation.\n(xii)  The  strategic  plans  will  also  identify  potential  and  agreed  areas  of  cooperation  and\ncollaboration among the countries of the region and the actions that need to be taken to\nensure such cooperation and collaboration takes place. All such areas of cooperation and\ncollaboration will also be reflected in the regional strategic plan.\n(xiii)  Plan, organize, and conduct a series of workshops to provide input to the planning process\nfrom a wide range of stakeholders. These will include a regional workshop to exchange\ninformation, experience, and views among representatives from the Bangladesh, India,\nMaldives, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka and regional organizations such as the South Asia\nCooperative Environment Programme.\n(xiv)  Revise the strategic plans based on the results of the workshops and web site responses.\nAn additional revision of the plans will take place following lessons learned from the  pilot\ntesting ICZM approaches in the selected HPAs. The final plans will then be prepared and", "Appendix 4, page 5\n20\ndiscussed at a series of local and national workshops near the end of the TA. The\nstrategic  plans  will  be  presented  to,  and  considered  for  approval,  by  the  respective\ngovernments prior to TA completion.\n3. Prefeasibility Level Studies for Investments\n7. Based on the strategic plans, and drawing on the national policies and priorities for coastal\nareas  development,  prefeasibility  studies  will  be  carried  out  for  long-term  investment  for\nsustainable development and conservation of HPAs. The study will include the following:\n(i)  prioritized  list  of  HPAs,  describing  the  magnitude  of  the  problem  and  the\ngeographical location of each area;\n(ii)  the types and magnitude of investments required, including a description of goals\nand objectives, the scope of work, and implementation arrangements;\n(iii) a description of how the investments (subprojects) relate to ongoing and proposed\nprojects in the coastal and marine sector; and\n(iv) an examination of the likely environmental and social impacts of the proposed\ninvestments; and for each of the investments proposed, the economic and financial\nbenefits, and an economic and financial justification; including cost estimates to the\nprefeasibility level of investment for each component in standard ADB formats with\nforeign and local currency costs should be shown separately.\nC. Regional Cooperation\n8. The IUCN team, with the assistance of international and domestic consultants will explore\nopportunities for cooperation among countries in the region and develop a regional strategic plan.\nThis  plan  will  include  recommendations  for  regional  cooperation  and  collaboration  including\nmechanisms for information exchange, database development and management, and capacity\nbuilding using institutions of excellence within the region.\n9. Other opportunities for regional cooperation will include an exchange of information, the\nestablishment of regional level database on coastal and marine resources, use of information\ntechnologies to communicate relevant experiences to coastal communities, cooperative marketing\nof coastal and marine products, and joint programs for enhanced environmental awareness and\nsustainable development of coastal and marine resources. These and other opportunities need to\nbe explored and defined in the regional strategic plan and presented as a part of the final report.\nThe regional strategic plan will include actions to be taken by the concerned governments to\nimplement the plan.\n10. With specific reference to regional cooperation in capacity building, the regional strategic\nplan will include a Capacity Building Plan (CBP).  The CPB will be based on the training needs of\nthe participating countries to enhance their capacity in ICZM approaches and strategies, with\nspecific reference to database development and management, sustainable development and\nconservation  of  HPAs,  and  community  participation.  The  CBP  will  include  appropriate\nrecommendations for training for government staff at various levels (including policymakers and\nplanners), the private sector (as appropriate), and coastal communities. The CBP will identify the\ninstitutions within the region where such capacity-building needs can be addressed. The CBP will\ninclude a detailed monitoring scheme that will be used to gauge the CBP\u2019s effectiveness.", "Appendix 4, page 6\n21\n11. The regional strategic plan will be presented at a workshop and the concurrence of the\nparticipating governments will be sought with the aims, objectives, areas of cooperation, and\nfollow-up actions proposed in the strategy.\nD. Reports\n12. An inception report will be prepared by the end of the second month, and quarterly\nprogress reports will be prepared thereafter. A draft final report will be prepared prior to the\nconclusion of the TA, discussed in a final workshop, and finalized after incorporating comments\nreceived at the workshop. A web site will be established as an integral part of the information\ndissemination strategy and all draft reports will be posted at the site for comment by participating\ncountries, other interested parties, and individuals. Final reports incorporating the comments will\nalso be posted on the web site and replace the draft reports. Other reports will include (i) strategic\nplans for HPAs in each participating country, (ii) site-specific strategies for pilot HPA sites; and (iii)\nregional strategic plan for cooperation."], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20010419113957", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 3.01 for Windows", "Author": "ldm", "Creator": "ADOBEPS4.DRV Version 4.10", "Title": "Microsoft Word - R46-01TA.doc", "ModDate": "D:20010820162705+08'00'"}}
