INTRODUCTION \n1.  During the 2001 Country Programming Mission, the Government of the Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic (Lao PDR) requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for a project \npreparatory technical assistance (TA) to prepare a feasibility study for improving the small \nairports in the country. In July 2002, an ADB fact-finding mission visited the Lao PDR and \nreached  an  understanding  with  the  Government  on  the  objectives,  scope,  cost,  and \nimplementation arrangements of the TA. The TA has been included in ADB\u2019s 2002 country \nstrategy and program.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The  Lao  PDR  is  landlocked  between  the  Peoples\u2019  Republic  of  China,  Cambodia, \nMyanmar,  Thailand,  and  Viet  Nam.  Two-thirds  of  its  land  area  is  covered  by  forest  and \nwoodland  accommodating  an  estimated  population  of  about  5.6  million  people.  Improved \ntransport facilities are crucial for the land-locked and mountainous country. In the absence of a \nrailway system and access to the sea, the country depends heavily on road network followed by \ncivil aviation. Rural accessibility is poor, with half of Lao PDR villages inaccessible during the \nrainy season. Lack of physical access is a severe impediment to delivery of social services and \nmarket  access.  The  development  of  civil  aviation  transport  infrastructure  is  also  crucial  to \npromote national, regional, and international tourism in the Lao PDR. \n \n3.  The Department of Civil Aviation (DCA) within the Ministry of Communication, Transport, \nPost and Construction (MCTPC) is responsible for policy and planning in civil aviation, and for \nregulatory oversight of technical and safety matters pertaining to Lao Aviation and the Lao \nAirports Authority (LAA). DCA has eight divisions2 plus LAA. Even though LAA is essentially an \noperating division, it is not independent of DCA but under DCA. At present, Lao PDR does not \nhave one comprehensive Civil Aviation Act (CAA). Instead, the civil aviation sector is governed \nby the functions of DCA under MCTPC designated by the Prime Minister\u2019s Decree. The draft \nCAA  recommended  by  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP)  and  the \nInternational Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)3 has been translated into Lao language and \nMCTPC has commenced interministry consultation. Government approval of the draft CAA for \nenactment at the National Assembly is expected by early 2003. \n \n4.  LAA has eight sections4 and is responsible for the operation and maintenance (O&M) of \nVientiane international airport, two regional airports (at Luang Prabang and Pakse), and two \nprovincial airports (at Savannakhet and Luang Namtha). All other provincial small airports are \nthe responsibility of the provincial governments with DCA\u2019s technical consultation. The Vientiane \ninternational terminal has been operated by a joint venture, the Lao-Japan Airport Terminal \nServices Co.,5 since June 1999. A proposal for restructuring LAA by splitting it into two entities \nresponsible for airports (LAA) and air traffic services (Lao Air Traffic Management, LATM) is \nbeing considered for Government approval by the end of 2002. The change aims to improve the \nsafety and O&M of airports. Both entities will collect revenues generated from their activities and \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 22 February 2002. \n2  Air Navigation, Air Transport and Safety, Aerodromes, Aeronautical Telecommunications, Planning and Finance, \nAdministration and Personnel, Airport Improvement Project, and Civil Aviation Training Center. \n3  Commercial Air Transport Policy with Emphasis on Aviation Legislation and Airline Finances and Operations, \nUNDP/ICAO Project, LAO/98/015, November 2000. \n4  Air Traffic Services, Passenger Terminal Operation, Electrical, Communications and Operations, Technical Supply, \nFire Station, Administration, and Finance. \n5  The government owns 51% and two Japanese companies own 49%. ", "2 \nretain from that an amount approved by the government for O&M expenses. DCA expects that \nthis is a first step toward granting full autonomy to LAA and LATM. \n \n5.  The national airline, Lao Aviation, a state-owned company,6 provides both domestic and \ninternational services. Lao Aviation is presently the only airline on international routes approved \nby the Government. Other international services to the Lao PDR are operated by Bangkok \nAirways,  China  Yunnan  Airlines,  Mandarin  Airlines,  Royal  Air  Cambodia,  Thai  Airways \nInternational, and Vietnam Airlines. Lao Aviation is also the only operator on all domestic routes. \nLao Aviation owns a fleet of 10 aircraft, including 3 Y-7s (50 seats), 4 Y-12s (17 seats), 2 ATR-\n72s (70 seats), and 1 helicopter.7 Lao Aviation operates on several international and domestic \nroutes using the ATR72. In April 2002, Air France Consulting entered into a management \narrangement with Lao Aviation to provide technical assistance to improve all aspect of Lao \nAviation\u2019s operation. The consultant will also assist Lao Aviation to prepare a strategy to set up \na joint venture (An indicative allocation of equity might be 40% by the Government and 60% by \nforeign and domestic investors.) The timetable will be dependent on the interest of potential \ninvestors.  \n \n6.  Three  airports  handle  international  traffic  in  the  Lao  PDR:  Vientiane,  the  main \ninternational gateway, and Luang Prabang and Pakse, which accept regional (Southeast Asia) \ntraffic, and provide customs, immigration, and quarantine services. The three main airports \ntogether with Savannakhet airport were upgraded under ADB\u2019s Loan 1266.8 In addition, 10 \nrecognized minor airports are located at the provincial capitals.9 Six of them (Houeisai, Luang \nNamtha,  Oudomxay,  Sam  Nua,  Sayaboury,  and  Xieng  Khouang)  are  operating  and  four \n(Attapeu, Phongsaly,10 Saravane, and Thakhek) are not.  \n \n7.  DCA\u2019s activities generate significant surplus. These surpluses mainly come from the air \nnavigation charges on overflights,11 which accounted for about 88% ($15.2 million) of the total \nrevenues of $17.2 million during 2001. Other revenues come from landing and navigation fees \nfor  aircraft,  passenger  service  charges,  and  other  rental  incomes.  DCA\u2019s  total  operating \nexpenses is about $437,000, equivalent to 2.5% of the total revenues during 2001. Only about \n$143,000, equivalent to 0.8% of the total revenues, was directed toward maintenance expenses \nin 2001. In particular, the actual annual budget allocation is well below the requested budget.12 \nConsequently, maintenance of airport facilities and equipment has not been up to international \nstandards.  \n \n8.  During the last 10 years (1992\u20132001), the international passenger traffic in the Lao PDR \nhas grown at an annual average rate of 10.2%, higher than the world average (about 7.1%). \nHowever, as a consequence of the global economic downturn in 2001 and the events of \n                                                 \n6  The board comprises seven directors: Vice-minister of MTCPC (Chairman), Vice-minister of Finance, Vice-\nPresident of Planning and Investment Committee, Deputy Director of Security Department of the Ministry of \nDefense, and Director General of DCA, President of Lao Aviation, and a representative of Lao Aviation staff. \n7  Two aircraft (one Y7 and one helicopter) are grounded and one Y-12 is waiting for overhaul. \n8  ADB. 1993. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to Lao \nPDR for the Airports Improvement Project. Manila.  \n9  Upgrading of infrastructure of 10 minor airports was included in the original scope of Loan 1266. But this scope was \ndeleted during project implementation in 1997 due to increased costs for improving four major airports. \n10  Phongsaly airport is currently under redevelopment for an airfield including access road and a bridge in an amount \nof $1.25 million with funding from the World Bank under Credit No. 3131.  \n11 Air routes pass over Lao PDR airspace are Bangkok-Hong Kong, Bangkok-Manila, Bangkok-Hanoi, and Hanoi-\nNew Delhi. \n12 For the fiscal year 2002, LAA requested a total of KN13.6 billion from MOF for O&M costs, but only KN4.5 billion \nwas budgeted by the Ministry of Finance. ", "    3 \nSeptember  11,  2001,  the  number  of  passengers  dropped  significantly  in  November  to \nDecember 2001. From January 2002, the number started to increase again, but the rate of \nincrease is slightly lower than that of the previous 2 years. Domestic passenger traffic has \ngrown at an annual average rate of 7.0% during the same period. The number of domestic \npassengers peaked at 273,366 in 1999 and slightly decreased to 252,938 in 2002 due to \n(i) improvement in road conditions in the southern provinces, (ii) domestic tariff increases in the \nLao nationals in 1999, and (iii) safety concerns about Lao Aviation operations as a result of \nthree  accidents  at  small  airports.  The  LAA  business  plan  (2002\u20132006)  projected  that \ninternational passenger traffic will grow at an average rate of 10% with more frequent flights as \na result of improving four major airports since 2000 and commencing of regional operation at \nPakse.  Domestic  passenger  traffic  is  projected  to  grow  much  more  slowly  due  to  recent \nsignificant increase in domestic tariffs for Lao nationals.13 \n \n9.  The 1991 Civil Aviation Master Plan (CAMP) for 1991\u20132000 was prepared by UNDP-\nICAO and reviewed 2 years later under ADB funding.14 ICAO has also provided assistance for \ndrafting aviation legislation and airline finances and operations, funded by UNDP in November \n2000 (footnote 3). As the current CAMP is now approaching 10 years of age, and the physical \nstate  of  various  airports,  traffic  demand  patterns,  and  institutional  structure  have  changed \nsubstantially, the government requested ADB to update the CAMP until 2013.  \n \n10.  Accessibility to provincial areas is limited due to lack of road network. In addition, air \ntransport to provincial locations in Lao PDR is generally considered unsafe and unreliable.15 \nThree accidents have occurred recently at or on approach to these airports (two at Sam Nua \nand one at Xieng Khoung) and one at Vientiane airport since 1995. Improving the Lao PDR\u2019s \ncivil aviation safety performance is critical to the development of these provincial locations and \npromotion of tourism in the region, given both higher concentration of the poor in these regions \nand the likely lack of development of road network in the medium term (10\u201320 years). According \nto the country strategy and program, ADB operations will primarily focus on northern region of \nthe country. The proposed Mekong Tourism Development Project includes improving Luang \nNamtha airport as one component for developing of national and regional tourism in the Lao \nPDR. Improving the remaining small airports in the northern region to acceptable international \nsafety  and  security  standards  will  be  crucial  to  providing  market  access  and  access  to \ngovernment services and investment that will have an impact on the living standards in this \nregion.  Using  savings  from  Loan  1266  (footnote  8),  ICAO  undertook  a  study  to  identify \nmeasures for safety and security improvement in small airports. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n11.  The main objectives of the study are to (i) undertake feasibility studies for improving six \nsmall airports (in Bokeo, Houaphan, Oudomxai, Phongsaly, Sayaboury, and Xieng Khouang \nprovinces) in the northern Lao PDR; and (ii) update and upgrade the CAMP to provide the \nframework for sustainable and effective development of the civil aviation sector. \n \n                                                 \n13 In May 2002, the government increased average tariffs from $0.08/seat/km to $0.20, bringing the tariff near to cost \nrecovery level (at 65% capacity utilization) by a 3-step increase until December 2002 using an exchange rate of \nKN9,500/$. The tariff for foreigners will not be changed from $0.23/seat/km. \n14 ADB. 1992. Technical Assistance to Lao PDR for the Review of the Civil Aviation Master Plan. \n15 UNDP has issued an embargo on traveling by Y7 and Y12 aircraft on domestic routes. ", "4 \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The scope of the project preparatory TA includes (i) updating and upgrading the CAMP; \n(ii) revising  and  preparing  outline  designs  and  cost  estimates  for  improving  small  airports; \n(iii) preparing a schedule for implementing improvements based on appropriate levels of service \nfor operators and users; (iv) preparing the economic and financial evaluation for each airport; \n(v) developing  appropriate  procurement  packaging  and  procedures  to  facilitate  project \nimplementation; (vi) assessing the development impact on poverty; and (vii) preparing social \nand environmental assessment and identifying necessary mitigation measures, if any, especially \nfor the poor. A summary of initial poverty and social analysis is in Appendix 1. \n \n13.  The consulting services will be carried out in two phases over 12 months. The first phase \nwill  update  and  upgrade  the  CAMP  for  the  next  10  years  to  provide  the  framework  for \nsustainable and effective development of the civil aviation sector, to support equitable economic \ndevelopment in the Lao PDR. After the Government agrees to the proposed CAMP, the second \nphase will prepare feasibility studies for improving six small airports in northern Lao PDR\u2014at \nBokeo (Houeisei), Huaphan (Xam Nua or Vieng Xay), Oudomxay, Phongsaly, Sayaboury, and \nXieng Khouang (Phonsavanh)\u2014to enhance safety and security, and efficiency of operation. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of TA is estimated at $590,000 equivalent comprising $398,000 in foreign \nexchange and $192,000 in local currency equivalent. ADB will provide $500,000 equivalent to \nfinance the entire foreign exchange cost and $102,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. \nThe TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government \nof Japan. The Government has agreed to finance $90,000 in kind, consisting of services to be \nprovided  (para.  15).  Details  of  the  cost  estimates  and  financing  plan  for  the  TA  are  in \nAppendix 2. The Government has been advised that approval of the TA by the ADB does not \ncommit ADB to finance ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The Executing Agency for the TA will be the Department of Civil Aviation (DCA) within \nMCTPC. DCA has the capacity to handle the TA successfully, given its prior experience with \nADB projects. The director general of DCA will be responsible for overall coordination among \nrelevant ministries and agencies, consultants, and ADB, including extensive consultations with \nstakeholders  and  nongovernment  organizations.  The  Government  will  set  up  a  steering \ncommittee to oversee and coordinate all activities for updating and upgrading the CAMP. The \nsteering committee will be chaired by a Vice Minister of MCTPC and comprise representatives \nfrom DCA, MCTPC, Ministry of Finance, Committee for Planning and Cooperation, National \nTourism Authority, and Lao Aviation. The Government will make available a team of counterpart \nstaff consisting of representatives from each division within DCA and provincial governments to \nhelp the consultants carry out the feasibility studies for six small airports in a timely manner. \nDCA will provide office accommodation, local communication facilities, office support staff, and \nother  administrative  support  including  arrangements  for  the  consultant\u2019s  travel  outside \nVientiane.  \n \n16.  The TA will require about 13 person-months of services by a team of international \nconsultants and about 9 person-months by domestic consultants. The study will be carried out \nby a multidisciplinary team of experts with experience in airport planning and engineering, air \ntransport economics and poverty analysis, aviation management and financial analysis, and ", "    5 \nsocial and environment assessment. Domestic consultants will be hired to carry out detailed \nsurveys and consultations. The team of consultants, from an international consulting firm in \nassociation with domestic consultants, will be engaged using ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based \nselection procedures and according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of the Consultants and \nother  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  on  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  The \noutline terms of reference for consultants that will be required are in Appendix 3. \n \n17.  The consultants will commence services in March 2003 and complete by February 2004. \nThe consultants will submit an inception report outlining their approach and methodology within \n3 weeks of the commencement of the services for the overall TA. A draft final report for updating \nand upgrading the CAMP will be submitted within 3 months of the commencement of the \nservices. The draft final report for CAMP will be reviewed by ICAO to ensure conforming to \nICAO  requirements  and  harmonization  with  neighboring  countries\u2019  civil  aviation  policy.  For \npreparation  of  feasibility  studies,  an  interim  report  will  be  submitted  within  8  months  of \ncommencement of the services and a draft final report within 10 months of commencement of \nthe services. Each final report for updating and upgrading the CAMP and feasibility studies will \nbe submitted within 1 month after the corresponding tripartite meetings. The TA is expected to \nbe completed by May 2004. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for preparing the Northern Airports \nImprovement Project, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nSUMMARY INITIAL POVERTY AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS \n \n \nA.

Further, poverty reduction \nin remote and poor provinces depends on domestic linkages and integration with a wider range of \nmarkets. The ability of these provinces to capture the benefits of economic growth and international trade \nwill depend on lifting domestic trade constraints that increase transportation costs and prices of goods. \nImprovements  in  civil  aviation  will  improve  access  to  domestic  and  international  markets,  thereby \nenhancing geographically balanced economic growth. As the Lao PDR lifts foreign trade constraints, \ninternational trade flows and associated economic growth will have a more equitable geographical \ndistribution.  Improved  price  incentives  for  consumer  goods  and  producer  inputs  resulting  from  the \nreduction in physical trade barriers will raise local investments and generate more income-earning \nopportunities. \n \nInadequate  infrastructure  and  airport  safety  are  also  major  constraints  for  tourism  expansion  and \ndevelopment  of  civil  aviation  removes  key  barriers  to  tourism  expansion  and  associated  benefits.  \nExpansion in tourism raises demand for locally produced handicrafts which is expected to generate \nincome-earning activities and raise incomes for women.  \n \nEnhanced access will also remove a key cost barrier for addressing shortages in food and other items in \ndeficit provinces while providing market for surplus producing provinces. Development of civil aviation will \nimprove the provinces\u2019 ability to attract new investments as risks and cost of information are reduced. \nCost efficiency in providing social services to less accessible areas will also be improved. \n  \n \nB.
