The Asian Development Bank's (ADB\u2019s) country strategy and program update for Pakistan \nfinalized in 2004 has good governance at the core of its development strategy. This emphasis is \nreflected in ADB\u2019s lending portfolio, with several important governance programs having been \napproved in the last 3 years.1 Public resource management\u2014which deals with the operational \ncommunication of public policies through fiscal, administrative, and political arrangements\u2014is a \nkey element of governance that has received increased attention in recent years, particularly in \nlight of Pakistan\u2019s decentralization reforms initiated in August 2001. In particular, the technical \nassistance  (TA)  provided  for  Enhancing  Capacity  for  Poverty  Reduction  and  Resource \nManagement in Punjab2 and the Punjab Resource Management Program (PRMP) loan (footnote \n1) initiated ADB\u2019s involvement in broadly based provincial reforms in Pakistan's largest province, \nPunjab. \n \n2.  The PRMP, which was designed as a cluster loan as shown in the table, incorporates \nreforms in development planning, fiscal and financial management, and public service delivery. \nThe PRMP was to be implemented by means of three subprograms over 5 years, with each \nsubprogram lasting 1 to 2 years. Subprogram 1, whose implementation began in December 2003, \nis currently under way, and second tranche release is expected in the first quarter of 2005.3 \nSubprogram 1 is progressing well. The delay in fielding the consultants financed under the TA loan \nwas largely compensated for by expanding some work tasks financed under TA 4015 (footnote 2), \nby having the respective implementing agencies doing some of the research, and by providing \nalternative  actions  as  proposed  in  the  PRMP  design.  Subprogram  2  is  to  be  designed  and \nprocessed for approval in 2005. The Government of Punjab has requested ADB for a TA grant to \nhelp prepare Subprogram 2 of the PRMP. The TA is included in ADB\u2019s 2004 program and is \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s country strategy and program update for Pakistan. The TA was designed \nduring the Fact-Finding Mission fielded on 10 to 11 August 2004, and understanding was reached \non the objectives, scope, effectiveness measures, and implementation arrangements.4 The TA \nframework is attached as Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Continuity of Reform Needs to Be Ensured. The first generation of macroeconomic \nreforms  at  the  federal  level  in  Pakistan  has  been  largely  successful,  with  countrywide \nmacroeconomic indicators improving significantly during the last 2 years. However, continued effort \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2001.

To allow proper sequencing from Subprogram 1 to \nSubprogram 2, the consultants financed under this TA should be fielded shortly after the release of the second tranche \nfor Subprogram 1.  \n4  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 27 September 2004.  \n ", "2    \nis required to ensure that the benefits of the improved macroeconomic outlook filter down to the \npoorest segments of society. In this regard, provincial resource management programs have an \nimportant role to play given that key responsibilities related to poverty reduction, including social \nservice  delivery,  are  now  largely  the  responsibility  of  local  governments,  with  the  provincial \ngovernments assuming a policymaking and monitoring role in this regard.  \n \nProgram Cluster Structure and Emphasis of Program Components \n \n    Achievements under \nThematic Program Components   Number of  Subprogram \nand Key Result Areas  Outcomes  1  2 and 3a \nComponent 1: Reforming Provincial Finances through       \nFiscal Restructuring and Financial Management  (cid:122)  (cid:157) \n  A.

Manila.  \n \n4.  Implementation Capacity Is Lacking. Implementation capacity remains weak at all levels \nof government in Pakistan, and this continued weakness poses risks to the implementation of key \nreform policies. Subprogram 1 of the PRMP made an important start by identifying capacity-\nbuilding needs in areas such as the reconciliation of accounts and planning and budgeting at the \nlocal government level. In addition, Subprogram 1 includes provisions for carrying out detailed \ninstitutional assessments of key departments like the Planning and Development Department and \nthe Finance Department to ascertain the adequacy of their structures, systems, and procedures in \nlight  of  recent  administrative  reforms.  Institutional  assessments  of  other  provincial  and  local \ndepartments will be pursued to identify and implement further capacity-building needs. \n \n5.  Fiscal  and  Financial  Reform  Agenda  Is  Incomplete.  Subprogram  1  of  the  PRMP \nemphasized provincial fiscal and financial reform, resulting in such actions as the abolition of low-\nyielding  taxes,  the  simplification  of  tax  structures,  and  the  reduction  of  exemptions.  These \nmeasures have increased revenue yields from provincial taxes by more than 12%. Studies under \nSubprogram 1 are aimed at introducing broadly based reforms of the taxation system; changing \nthe tax administration to increase collection efficiencies, including the agricultural income tax; and \ndetermining and dealing with the government\u2019s contingent liabilities. The need to ensure that the ", "      3\nmomentum generated by the PRMP is not lost and that further restructuring of key taxes takes \nplace is urgent. \n \n6.  Local Government Financing Mechanisms Remain Weak. Fiscal and financial reform at \nthe provincial level is vital to ensure the efficient and transparent flow of funds to lower tiers of \ngovernment. Subprogram 1 includes a study on the transfer of resources from provincial to local \ngovernments to address revenue collection issues at the local level, and is being carried forward in \nconsultation with the  Decentralization Support Program (footnote 1). Subprogram 2 needs to \ncontinue the focus on the increased responsibilities of local governments. This can be done by \nhelping districts to prepare poverty-focused investment strategies aimed at facilitating access to \nfunds from the Provincial Finance Commission.  \n \n7.  Public Service Delivery Remains Weak. Devolution has far-reaching implications for the \nstructure and role of provincial governments. With local governments now assigned responsibility \nfor delivering most social and productive services, provinces must restructure themselves and \nadopt new systems consistent with their new responsibilities for policymaking and for supporting, \nsupervising, and monitoring the performance of agencies with which they have no direct command \nand control relationship.  \n \n8.  Poverty  Alleviation  Efforts  Require  Continuity.  Punjab  has  developed  a  poverty \nreduction strategy. Further work in this area has been supported through Subprogram 1, and a \nmedium-term budget framework and poverty-focused investment strategy are being developed. \nInitial work on four district-level poverty reduction plans has also commenced. Initiatives such as \ncollecting poverty-related data from 34 districts are now to be institutionalized as part of provincial \npolicy.  \n \n9.  Serious  Issues  Remain  in  Human  Resource  Management.  Punjab's  public \nadministration  is  overstaffed  and  underpaid  and  is  generally  operating  below  potential. \nSubprogram 1 has initiated reforms in this area, including fostering recruitment on a contractual \nbasis, introducing a gender-disaggregated civil service census to support the development of a \nhuman resource database of provincial government employees, and developing operational plans \nfor  the  effective  application  of  information  technology  in  public  sector  human  resource \nmanagement. Furthermore, general steps have been initiated toward gradually reducing the share \nof expenditures on salaries and pensions. More work is required to improve the capacity and \nefficiency of the civil service while reducing the overall size of the government.  \n \n10.  Private Sector Needs to Be Further Developed and Encouraged. The private sector \nneeds to play a larger role in the province\u2019s development. Subprogram 1 initiated reforms in labor \nand industrial policies whereby some regulatory restrictions and other impediments to private \nsector development were removed. A review of labor, industrial safety, and environmental policies \nhas been initiated, along with the development of relevant rules and implementation mechanisms. \nAdditional reforms are needed to identify areas for capacity building to support public-private \npartnerships, including for contract and risk management. Other policy changes will encourage \nfurther development of small and medium enterprises in Punjab.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n11.  The purpose of the TA is to continue and further develop broadly based policy reforms in \nPunjab through the preparation of Subprogram 2. Policy reforms under the PRMP are divided into \nthe  three  thematic  program  areas  of  (i)  fiscal  and  financial  management,  (ii)  processes  and \n ", "4    \ninstitutions for pro-poor service delivery, and (iii) private sector development. The purpose is only \nachieved when policy reforms result in public resource management that is efficient, cost-effective, \ntransparent, and accountable and leads to higher equity and sustainability.  \n \n12.  The first output will be draft papers outlining further policy interventions for Subprogram 2 in \nthe program areas. The second output will be enhanced capacity within the Program Management \nUnit  (PMU)  to  coordinate  and  develop  public  resource  management  policies,  systems,  and \nprocedures. The TA will emphasize extensive stakeholder participation (government, civil society \ngroups, politicians from the provincial and local government levels, private sector, and the media) \nto develop Subprogram 2, and based on continuous policy dialogue, to implement and further \nimprove the reform agenda.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The TA will fund (i) domestic experts to ensure program coordination, to enhance policy \nanalysis  within  the  PMU,  and  to  develop  the  policy  reform  agenda  for  Subprogram  2;  (ii) \nworkshops to promote participation by civil society and other stakeholders; and (iii) studies to \nenhance public resource management.  \n \n14.  The  workshops  will  build  on  the  Second  Punjab  Development  Forum,5  at  which \nstakeholders will be engaged to critically scrutinize the impact and initial results of the PRMP and \nto further develop the policy reform agenda for Punjab. The TA will fund three follow-up workshops \nfor representatives of all stakeholder groups that will build on proposals made during the Punjab \nDevelopment Forum and should lead to policy formulation supported under Subprogram 2. Papers, \nsummarized minutes, and results of the workshops will be made public on the PRMP web site.6 \n \n15.  Another key activity is TA support for studies to strengthen public resource management. \nAll studies will be linked to ongoing work under the PRMP. One study will assess the challenges \nfacing Punjab\u2019s fiscal and financial management and the policy changes needed to strengthen \nprovincial revenue, rationalize provincial expenditures, and improve provincial and local financial \nmanagement.  A  second  study  will  develop  mechanisms  for  the  strategic  programming  of \ninvestments for poverty reduction. A third study will develop policy options for human resource \nmanagement and administrative strengthening. A fourth study will explore additional regulatory and \nadministrative reforms for private sector development and public-private partnerships. A fifth study \nwill look at policy options to further reduce direct involvement by the public sector in commercial \nactivities.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $312,500 equivalent in local currency costs. ADB will provide \n$250,000 equivalent on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government of Punjab \nwill contribute the remaining local currency cost of $62,500 equivalent in kind by providing office \naccommodation, counterpart staff support, and facilities for seminars and meetings. Appendix 2 \npresents the cost estimates and financing plan. \n \n                                                 \n5  Such forums are planned for February or March every year to increase their impact on budget formulation in May.  \n6  http://www.punjab-prmp.gov.pk. ", "      5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The  executing  agency  for  the  TA  will  be  the  Punjab  Planning  and  Development \nDepartment. Implementing agencies to be supported by the TA will include the departments of \nPlanning  and  Development,  Finance,  Excise  and  Taxation,  Management  and  Professional \nDevelopment, Industries, Commerce and Investment Promotion, Labor and Manpower, and Food. \nEach implementing agency already has a core team, which together with the consultants for the \nTA will be responsible for undertaking the key activities agreed upon for their particular area. The \nPunjab Planning and Development Department has already established a PMU and has appointed \na senior official to act as project director. The PMU has a core staff and will be assisted by the \nconsultants recruited for the TA. \n \n18.  The TA is expected to commence by February 2005 and be implemented over a period of \n18 months until July 2006.  \n \n19.  All consultants will prepare inception reports on their respective work assignments within 4 \nweeks of the commencement of their services that will fine-tune and detail the work program and \nestablish time-bound outputs. A full report together with a description of proposed activities and \nachievements for Subprogram 2 will conclude the respective assignments. The final report, which \nwill include complete documentation of all outputs, will be submitted within 1 month of the end of \nthe assignment.   \n \n20.  Procurement must be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. No major \nprocurement is envisaged for the TA. Supply contracts valued at $50,000 or less may be procured \nusing direct purchase procedures. \n \n21.  The TA will require 43 person-months of domestic consulting services. The outline terms of \nreference for the consultants are provided in Appendix 3. All consultants will be recruited as \nindividuals in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants using arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n22.  The  President,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  by  the  Board,  has  approved  the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $250,000 on a grant basis to the \nGovernment of Pakistan for Support for Subprogram 2 of the Punjab Resource Management \nProgram, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \n  Performance Indicators  Monitoring   Assumptions \nDesign Summary  and Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \nGoal       \n     \nSupport good governance;
