INTRODUCTION\n1. The family income and expenditure survey (FIES) that the National Statistics Office\n(NSO)  has  conducted  every  three  years  since  19851  is  the  major  source  of  data  for  the\nPhilippines\u2019 official poverty estimates. NSO, with support from the World Bank and United\nNations Development Programme (UNDP), also initiated the annual poverty indicator survey\n(APIS) in 1998 to supplement poverty monitoring. In December 1999, the Government of the\nRepublic  of  the  Philippines,  through  NSO,  asked  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for\ntechnical assistance (TA) to improve these poverty monitoring surveys. The TA for Improving\nPoverty Monitoring Surveys was included in ADB\u2019s projected TA Country Assistance Plan.2  In\nApril  2001,  the  TA\u2019s  objectives  and  scope  were  confirmed  by  the  Government.  The  TA\nframework is in Appendix 1.\nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. To gather social, demographic, health, labor force, and employment statistics, NSO\nconducts household surveys based on a master sample taken from the most recent census of\npopulation and housing. These surveys have many other critical uses, including providing inputs\nfor economic and social accounting as well as poverty monitoring and analysis. The two surveys\nthat are most concerned with poverty monitoring are the FIES and APIS. The FIES collects data\non family income and living expenses and related information affecting income and expenditure\nlevels and patterns. It is the basis of poverty estimates and the weights for the consumer price\nindex. The two most recent rounds of the FIES were designed to provide reliable estimates of\nurban and rural poverty. However, the APIS provides a more frequent assessment of poverty\nstatus, specifically during non-FIES years.  It collects information on the socioeconomic profile\nof households and other information relating to their living conditions\u2014economic characteristics;\naccess to electricity, health, education, housing, water, and sanitation facilities; and credit to\nfinance family-owned enterprises.\n3. Although both the FIES and APIS collect income and expenditure data, an estimation of\nthe incidence, magnitude, and depth of poverty has not been attempted using the APIS because\nof the incomparability of some data items and reference periods between the two surveys.\nFurthermore, while the common components of the master sample are used in both surveys,\nthe results of the FIES and APIS are analyzed independently and not as a panel, thereby\npassing up the opportunity to measure the gross change in the poverty status of households\nand the insights that could be gained from investigating the relationships of the gross change of\npoverty status to other household characteristics.\n4. To  support  the  Government\u2019s  poverty  reduction  program,  NSO  plans  to  continue\nconducting an APIS in years when an FIES is not held. NSO conducted the 1999 APIS entirely\nwith Government funding. Annual poverty indicators can therefore be compiled from these two\nsurveys  provided  that  the  problems  are  resolved.  However,  while  monitoring  poverty  is  a\ngovernment priority, the cost, and hence the sustainability, of conducting the FIES and APIS\nregularly  have  not  been  investigated  seriously.  The  value  added  by  measuring  poverty\nindicators every year may be insignificant since the yearly change in these indicators may not\nbe detected or may not be statistically significant because such changes are usually small\n                                                \n1  Similar surveys were undertaken in 1957, 1961, 1965, 1971, 1975, and 1979.\n2  The ADB Fact-Finding Mission was fielded on April 2000 and the TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities\n(electronic version) in May 2000.", "2\nrelative to sampling error. An indepth study is therefore needed to find ways of making the\nsurveys more efficient and cost effective.\n5. NSO\u2019s  capacity  to  design  and  implement  sample  survey  strategies  must  also  be\nstrengthened. Although many NSO technical staff have an academic background in sample\nsurveys, their experience is limited only to the sampling design and operations of NSO surveys.\nAside from the usual tabulation of survey results, little research and analysis has been done on\nthe sampling errors of completed surveys. NSO has tended to rely on experts from international\naid agencies to develop and improve the master sample design for the household surveys.\nBecause these experts were only available intermittently, skills transfer to NSO staff has been\ninadequate, so that external technical advice is still needed to improve the master sample\ndesign.\nIII.  THE  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.  Objectives\n6. The TA\u2019s goal is to improve NSO\u2019s poverty monitoring surveys.  The TA aims to assist\nNSO in (i) linking the FIES and APIS for more indepth poverty analysis and research; (ii)\nimproving the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the FIES and APIS by developing better\nsurvey  strategies  (questionnaire,  sampling,  and  field  operations);  and  (iii)  establishing  a\nresearch and development unit in NSO that will be responsible for sustained enhancement of\nsurvey sampling and operations.\nB.  Scope\n7. The TA will provide advice from a panel survey design and analysis expert and a poverty\nspecialist. NSO will provide counterpart staff who will comprise the core of a research and\ndevelopment unit that will be established in NSO under the TA. The international consultants\nand NSO counterpart staff will form a team to evaluate aspects of the FIES conducted in 1994\nand  1997,  and  the  APIS  held  in  1998  and  1999;  and  link  these  surveys  to  generate  a\nlongitudinal analysis and enhance the design and implementation of succeeding surveys. The\nfour surveys will be linked and analyzed as a panel to the extent possible, to help measure the\ngross change in poverty status. This measurement will lead to a better analysis of how changes\nin household poverty status are linked to other household characteristics, so that the probable\ncauses of changes in poverty status can be investigated. Because these surveys were not\ndesigned as a panel, the standard statistical and data processing techniques may not be\nadequate and must be expanded through research on statistical methodology.  In addition to\non-the-job training, the international consultants will conduct seminars on the results of the\nsurveys for NSO staff and major users of the surveys in government, the private sector, and\ninternational organizations based in the Philippines. The international consultants will also give\nlectures on specific topics of survey design and methodology to the research and development\nunit and other interested NSO staff.\n8. Insights from the experience in linking and analyzing the four surveys will help draw up a\nbetter strategy for succeeding surveys. Research will be conducted on the appropriate sample\nsizes and rotation schemes to reduce sampling error and improve the cost-effectiveness of the\nsurveys and to decide on their frequency. Major data users from government, the private sector,\nand international organizations will be consulted on the list of data items through workshops and\nsmall discussion groups to improve the data content and use of the surveys. Questionnaire", "3\ndesign  and  field  and  data  processing  operations  of  the  four  completed  surveys  will  be\ninvestigated and improved to minimize nonsampling errors in future surveys. The new sampling\nstrategy will generate the master sample for the household surveys (FIES, APIS, Labor Force\nSurvey,  National  Demographic  Survey,  and  Maternal  Child  Health  Survey)  from  the  2000\nCensus of Population and Housing. The international consultants will provide formal and on-the-\njob training on the new survey strategies to NSO staff. Special studies and surveys will also be\nconducted to validate the new survey strategies.\n9. The  TA  will  include  the  seminars,  training,  and  consultative  and  dissemination\nworkshops  to  (i)  obtain  major  users\u2019  perspectives  regarding  the  FIES  and  APIS,  and  (ii)\ndisseminate the results of analysis and research on these surveys. Moreover, the TA will\nsupport an apprenticeship program for selected staff of the research unit to be established.\nUnder this program, the selected staff will work for one to two months in a host institution that\nhas  a  good  reputation  in  conducting  panel  surveys.  The  apprenticeship  program  will  be\ndesigned to familiarize the trainees with the analysis and design of panel surveys.\n10. In addition to advisory services, extensive training, and the apprenticeship program on\nsurvey operations and design, the TA will help develop the research and development unit by\nprocuring training books, CD ROMs, and other materials, with the emphasis on survey design\nand operations and poverty monitoring and analysis. A very small amount of computer hardware\nand software may be procured under the TA.\nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n11. The TA is estimated to cost $547,000 equivalent, of which $260,000 is the foreign\nexchange cost and $287,000 equivalent is the local currency cost (Appendix 2). The TA will be\njointly  co-financed,  on  a  grant  basis,  by  the  Government  of  New  Zealand  for  $150,000\nequivalent  and  ADB  for  $197,000  equivalent  from  the  ADB-funded  TA  Program,  to  cover\n$260,000 foreign exchange cost and $87,000 equivalent of the local cost.  The funding from the\nGovernment  of  New  Zealand  will  cover  the  cost  of  apprenticeship,  training,  seminars,\nconferences, special studies, surveys and contingencies. The Government of the Philippines will\nfinance the balance of the local currency cost, equivalent to $200,000, covering the cost of\nconducting sample surveys; printing questionnaires, manuals, and reports; paying counterpart\nstaff salaries; making office facilities available; and providing other administrative overheads.\nD.  Implementation Arrangements\n12. The TA, which is expected to begin during the second quarter of 2001, will be spread\nover 24 months, with completion by June 2003.  NSO will be the Executing Agency.  Aside from\nits administrative functions, NSO will (i) provide counterpart staff to work with the consultants;\n(ii) seek government funding for surveys; and (iii) provide administrative and technical support,\nincluding data processing, to the consultants.\n13. ADB\u2019s  Statistics  and  Data  Systems  Division  (EDSD),  part  of  the  Economics  and\nDevelopment Resource Center, in collaboration with Division 1 (East Asia) of Programs East\nand the Philippine Country Office, will administer the TA. ADB will coordinate TA implementation\nwith other funding agencies, particularly the World Bank and UNDP, to reduce duplication of\nactivities.  TA  monitoring  and  review  will  be  done  through  ADB  missions,  correspondence\nincluding e-mail, and reports of consultants. The EDSD project officer will coordinate all the\nactivities of the TA and will act as liaison with NSO. NSO will submit an assessment report and\nrecommendations for future action after completion of each major activity.", "4\n14. The TA will engage a panel survey design and analysis expert and a poverty specialist\nfor four person-months each. The EDSD project officer will coordinate the activities of the\nconsultants, who will be selected individually and will be engaged in accordance with ADB's\nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. Outline terms of reference of both consultants are in\nAppendix 3.\n15. The NSO management and the consultants will recommend to ADB the candidates for\nthe apprenticeship program. The selection criteria, terms, and conditions for the apprenticeship\nprogram are in Appendix 4. Upon completion, the trainees will submit a report to NSO and ADB\nabout their assessment of their apprenticeship program and their recommendations on how to\nincorporate what they have learned in their jobs. The Government will take the necessary steps\nto ensure that the staff who participate in the apprenticeship program will return and continue\nworking for NSO.\n16. The purchase of durable equipment from TA proceeds will be undertaken in accordance\nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.  The  equipment  will  be  turned  over  to  NSO  upon\ncompletion of the TA.\nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n17. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved: (i) ADB\nadministering  a  portion  of  technical  assistance  to  the  Government  of  the  Republic  of  the\nPhilippines in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of $150,000 to be financed by the\nGovernment of New Zealand on a grant basis; and (ii) the provision of technical assistance, on\na grant basis, to the Government of the Republic of the Philippines in an amount not exceeding\nthe equivalent of $197,000 for the purpose of Improving Poverty Monitoring Surveys, and\nhereby reports such action to the Board.", "TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK\nDesign Summary Performance Monitoring Mechanisms Assumptions and Risks\nIndicators and Targets\nGoal\nImprove poverty monitoring More efficient and cost-effective Analysis of sampling errors Government support,\nsurveys household surveys with poverty- and survey results, and availability and cooperation of\nmonitoring components reactions of major users good counterparts, and active\nparticipation of major users\nPurpose\nLink the family income and Comparable poverty estimates, Results of analysis and Availability of good\nexpenditure survey (FIES) staff trained in poverty analysis, research, reports of National consultants and counterpart\nand annual poverty indicator and more poverty research Statistics Office (NSO) staff, staff, and validated survey\nR\nsurvey (APIS) for indepth papers consultants\u2019 reports, and data files\ne\nf\ne poverty analysis and research Asian Development Bank\nr\ne (ADB) missions\nn\nc\ne\n \nin Improve sample survey An efficient and cost-effective Assessment of major users, Availability of good\n  5\nte strategies based on research household survey system consultants\u2019 assessment, and consultants and counterpart\nx\nt: results ADB missions staff, and\n \np\na Government support\ng\ne\n \n1 Establish a research unit in Functioning research unit at Consultants\u2019 report, ADB Availability of technically\n,\n \np NSO NSO missions, and NSO\u2019s competent  NSO staff\na\nra assessment\n.\n \n1\n)\nOutputs\nLinked 1994 and 1997 FIES, Matched electronic files of the Completed electronic files of Availability of good data\nand 1998 and 1999 APIS surveys the surveys processing counterpart staff\nA\np\nGross poverty status and Computed gross poverty status Statistical tables, consultant\u2019s Surveys can be linked p\ne\nother panel survey estimates indicators and panel survey report, and ADB mission n\nd\nestimates ix\n \n1\n,\n \np\nPoverty research Completed poverty research that NSO report, ADB mission, Availability of qualified NSO a\ng\nused the linked surveys and consultant\u2019s report staff and good consultants e\n \n1", "TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK\nDesign Summary Performance Monitoring Mechanisms Assumptions and Risks\nIndicators/ Targets\nEfficient and cost-effective Favorable results of sensitivity ADB mission, NSO\u2019s Major users\u2019 cooperation,\nsample survey strategies analysis from the surveys assessment, and consultant\u2019s Government support, and the\nreport availability of good\nconsultants\nFunctioning NSO research NSO staff capable of ADB mission, consultant\u2019s Government support and\nunit independent sample survey report, and NSO staff\u2019s inputs NSO\u2019s cooperation\nmethodology research to discussions\nActivities Inputs\nFormation of research unit Qualified NSO staff, work plan of Review missions, consultants\u2019 Availability of qualified NSO\nthe unit, and consultants\u2019 assessment, and NSO\u2019s staff, and NSO\u2019s top\ntechnical advice report management cooperation\nReview and documentation of Documentation of the surveys Consultant\u2019s report and ADB Availability of documentation,\nthe FIES 1994 and 1997, and (questionnaires, notes, and mission report and NSO staff who know the 6\nthe APIS 1998 and 1999 manuals), and knowledgeable sampling strategies\nNSO counterpart implemented in 1994 and\n1997-1999\nLinking of the 1994 and 1997 Electronic files of the surveys Linked data files ready for Availability of comparable\nFIES, and the 1998 and 1999 with appropriate index keys, and analysis, consultant\u2019s report, index keys from surveys and\nAPIS data matching and validating and ADB mission good data processing\nprocedures from consultants counterpart staff\nLongitudinal poverty analysis Linked surveys, and research Technical papers and Availability of good consultant\nobjectives and methodology research results and data processing\ncounterpart staff\nA\np\np\nApprenticeship program NSO\u2019s recommendations, ADB\u2019s Trainees\u2019 reports, NSO Availability of suitable e\nn\nassessment, and host assessment, and ADB apprenticeship program on d\nix\ninstitution\u2019s program of activities missions survey design and operations  1\n,\n \np\na\nDevelopment of better Recommendations from major Assessment of major users, Availability of good g\ne\nhousehold survey strategy users, consultants, NSO staff, consultants\u2019 assessment, and consultants and counterpart  \n2\nand sensitivity analysis ADB missions staff, and Government\nprocedures support", "7\nAppendix 2\nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN\n($'000)\nForeign Local Total Cost\nItem Exchange Currency\nA.
