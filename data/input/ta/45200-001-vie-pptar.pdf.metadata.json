Justification \n1  A project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) is needed to develop sustainable low \ncarbon urban transport programs and projects in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC). The objective of the \nPPTA is to ensure integration of public transport occurs in six districts along Mass Rapid Transit \n(MRT) Line 2. The outcome of the PPTA will be the identification of energy efficient urban \ntransport solutions which, in conjunction of the HCMC MRT Line 2 (MRT2) project10, can lead to \nsignificant greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions for HCMC. The assistance will focus on \nidentifying  and  developing  a  series  of  innovative  and  transformational  interventions,  which \nenhance the quality of public transport systems and that can significantly increase the modal \nshare of public transport in HCMC. \n \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n2  Overview of the PPTA: The PPTA will be conducted in two phases, firstly to evaluate \nand determine suitable measures, then secondly to design the agreed measures.  The first \nphase  will  evaluate  existing  urban  transport  developments  in  HCMC,  determine  suitable \nmeasures  that  can  be  implemented  along  MRT2  and  recommend  an  overall  program  for \nconsideration  by  government  and  ADB.    Proposed  measures  could  include  physical \ninfrastructure, further studies, capacity building and changes to relevant policies or regulations. \nThis will be the basis for agreement with the government for project definition under the loan at \nthe first tripartite meeting.  For the measures that are agreed by government and ADB, the \nsecond phase will further conceptualize and undertake necessary feasibility design to prepare \nthe project loan for ADB financing.  The final project loan scope will be agreed at the second \ntripartite meeting. \n \n3  The PPTA will focus on three key areas that are expected to ensure that MRT2 is well \nintegrated, being; (i) improved connectivity for MRT2 stations, (ii) improved integration of public \ntransport  serving  the  MRT2,  and  (iii)  policy  and  regulatory  changes  to  encourage  public \ntransport usage and discourage private vehicles. \n \n4  The PPTA will consist of the following two components under each focal area; \n \n\u2022  Component  1:  Assessment  and  definition  of  public  transport  measures  to  be \nimplemented under the Project in the three main areas including: \n  Improved  connectivity  for  MRT2  stations:  Assessment  and  development  of \no\nmeasures,  including;  MRT  station  enhancements,  improved  pedestrian \ninfrastructure including pedestrian priorities and facilities to and from stations, \ntraffic management measures at junctions in proximity of stations, restricting \nparking on public pavements and commercial development opportunities \n  Integrated and innovative public transport services and measures connecting to \no\nMRT2 stations: detailed plan to reorganize and improve the public transport \nnetwork connected to MRT2, including (a) a plan for routing and rationalization of \npublic transport routes and franchising arrangements, (b) a program for public \ntransport fleet renewal to promote low emission vehicles that are suitable to \n                                                \n10 ADB. 2010.

The PPTA will closely coordinate with \nproposed technical assistance to be provided by the World Bank to Department of Transport \n(DOT) for bus sector improvements, which is expected to be undertaken in 2012-2015.  In \naddition, it is expected the Singapore government will provide support for development of \ncapacity building program for HCMC urban transport authorities.  ADB proposes concurrent \nassistance to develop sustainable urban transport in Ha Noi for Metro Line 3, and both projects\u2019 \npreparation and implementation will be closely coordinated, including between respective city \ngovernments.  Coordination of urban transport measures will be enhanced by holding both \ninformal and joint meetings between transport officials from Ha Noi and HCMC.  \n \n6  The government has been informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to \nfinance any ensuing project.
