INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  Government  of  Thailand  has  asked  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to \nformulate  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  support  the  government's  core  challenge  and \nresponsibility  in  implementing  the  medium-term  infrastructure  investment  program  through \npublic\u2013private partnerships (PPPs). This would ensure that public resources are used efficiently \nand  effectively.  The  2007\u20132011  country  partnership  strategy  identifies  infrastructure \ndevelopment  as  one  of  three  core  strategic  areas  considered  essential  for  enhancing  the \ncompetitiveness of Thailand\u2019s economy.1 The overarching objectives of the strategy are to \nsupport  Thailand\u2019s  national  economic  and  social  development  agenda;  and  to  strengthen \nThailand\u2019s role and capacity as a regional development partner. ADB would provide value \naddition in three core strategic areas essential for enhancing the competitiveness of Thailand\u2019s \neconomy:  infrastructure  development,  capital  market  development,  and  environmentally \nsustainable  development.  Since  2006,  ADB  TA  projects  have  supported  capital  market \ndevelopment.  During  2006\u20132009,  ADB  provided  a  series  of  TA  projects2 to  prepare  for \nexpansion  of  the  Bangkok  mass  rapid  transit  system;  they  are  expected  to  lead  to \nimplementation of a mass rapid transit integrated ticketing project (in the 2010 loan pipeline for \n$10  million).  Support  for  environmentally  sustainable  development  includes  TA 3  for \nmainstreaming energy efficiency in municipalities and a loan and partial credit guarantee for \nBiomass, a limited power project.4 The government is also committed to applying best practices \nand innovative approaches in the planning, financing, and operation of new infrastructure and \nfacilities. The government is now asking for TA support to develop an enabling PPP framework, \nto help structure priority projects, and to develop institutional capacity. The TA will ensure close \ncoordination with regional ADB initiatives that may involve Thailand in PPPs. By seeking to \nmaximize  opportunities  for  private  sector  participation,  the  government  aims  to  reduce  its \nfinancial  burden,  promote  technologically  advanced  designs  and  systems,  ensure  timely \nconstruction,  and  achieve  operating  efficiencies.  Consultations  were  undertaken  with  the \ngovernment during 11\u201313 January 2010 and 3\u20134 March 2010 to reach an understanding on the \noverall  objective,  scope,  and  implementation  arrangements  for  the  TA.  The  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.5  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Mixed success in public\u2013private partnerships. Thailand\u2019s experience with attracting \nprivate investments in infrastructure has been mixed, especially when compared with many of \nits neighbors. Only telecommunications and energy have experienced sustained investment. \nTelecommunications in Thailand has shown good progress in terms of increasing access and \nentry of new service providers backed by a strong regulator. An important step in PPPs in the \ncountry  was  the  first  round  of  independent  power  producers  bidding  in  1994  when  six \ncompanies were awarded contracts to generate 3,870 megawatts of power. In the 1990s, \nlimited private sector participation in water and sanitation included lease and management \ncontracts with the metropolitan and provincial water authorities. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2007.

Of the three concessions granted in the 1990s for mass transit projects in metropolitan \nBangkok, only the Green Line concession was implemented. In 1992, the Mass Rapid Transit \nAuthority  was  established  to  take  over  rail  transit  functions  from  the  Expressway  Transit \nAuthority. In 2000, after the Asian financial crisis, a concession was granted for operation and \nmaintenance of the Blue Line. Ridership for both mass transit projects has been below the \nforecasts, although this is not unusual for such projects. Ridership has been adversely impacted \nby lack of integration between the two systems\u2014both physical as well as ticketing\u2014and with the \npublic bus network. Expressway projects in Bangkok have encountered problems with land \nacquisition  and  enforcement  of  contractually  agreed  tolls.  The  implementation  of  a  port \nexpansion plan by the Port Authority of Thailand with the private participation of Hutchinson Port \nHoldings on a build\u2013operate\u2013transfer basis to construct and operate six new berths can be \nconsidered a successful PPP venture.  \n \n4.  Declining  investments  in  infrastructure.  Many  factors  account  for  a  country\u2019s \ncompetitiveness in the global economy. In Thailand, deficient infrastructure is consistently cited \nas a principal constraint to private investment and productivity growth.6 Thailand\u2019s infrastructure \ndeficiencies  can  be  traced  to  the  significant  decline  in  public  investment  since  the  Asian \nfinancial crisis in 1997. Immediately before the crisis, public investment was as high as 10% of \ngross domestic product (GDP), but it now has slipped to about 8%. Private investments in \ninfrastructure  projects  have  also  been  declining  as  a  percentage  of  GDP.  In  comparison, \ncountries such as India and Viet Nam have registered considerably more growth in private \ninvestment in infrastructure development over the last 10 years.  \n \n5.  Need for public\u2013private partnerships. The 10th National Plan identifies infrastructure \ndevelopment as a national priority to enhance Thailand\u2019s competitiveness and support long-term \ngrowth. Thailand\u2019s medium-term infrastructure investment program represents a positive first \nstep to close the widening gap in infrastructure investment. A major policy initiative under the \nStrong  Thailand  2012  fiscal  stimulus  program  is  to  promote  economic  growth  through \ninfrastructure development over the medium term. With the projected increase in public debt \nfrom about 45% of GDP in 2009 to about 59% by 2012 at the end of the stimulus program, the \ngovernment is keen to consider alternate modes of financing infrastructure by inviting private \nparticipation under the PPP mode. Total infrastructure investment requirements are projected at \nB1.43 trillion under the stimulus program, of which B145 billion is proposed to be mobilized \nthrough PPPs.    \n \n6.  Enabling provisions. Until the late 1980s, state-owned enterprises were the principal \nsources of financing for infrastructure and the provision of its services. To provide a framework \nfor private participation, the Royal Act on Private Participation in State Undertaking was enacted \nin 1992. The act provides the approval and procurement processes for private participation in \nactivities undertaken by the state that have an investment value of B1 billion or more. However, \nonly  11  PPP  projects  have  actually  been  implemented  under  the  act\u2014a  fraction  of  those \nproposed by the private sector. The act does not explicitly define a clear enabling framework \nfrom an investor\u2019s perspective. Specific drawbacks include (i) time-consuming and prescriptive \nprocedures; (ii) lack of clear definition of the nature, scope, and sector of a project; (iii) lack of \ndefined policy principles and procurement process to be followed, which can lead to potential \nsubjectivity in decision-making; (iv) undefined provisions for government support or obligations; \n                                                 \n6  Infrastructure, skill shortages, and heavy regulatory burdens are cited as three principal constraints to private \ninvestment  and  productivity  growth  in  Thailand.

Support  is \nneeded in drafting amendments for the act\u2014the responsibility of the Comptroller General's \nDepartment.  \n \n7.  Independent regulators. Sector-specific independent regulators are in place only for \ntelecommunications and energy. In all other sectors, the ministry or concerned agency acts as \nthe regulatory body. The absence of an arms-length relationship between the regulatory and \npolicy functions has constrained private sector participation in PPP projects. Sector-specific \nguidelines are required to delineate sector-specific project development requirements. This is \nimportant in the context of private participation in mega projects where output and performance \ncriteria or specifications should be stated. \n \n8.  Public\u2013private  partnership  framework  and  policy.  A  clear  policy  for  PPPs  is \nnecessary for the PPP program to gain momentum. National PPP policies, guidelines, and fiscal \nrules are needed, as well as coordination for sector PPP plans. A political champion is also \nneeded.  The  government  has  made  a  good  beginning  by  the  setting  up  of  a  high-level \ncommittee chaired by the deputy prime minister and comprising the line ministries as members. \nThe State Enterprise Policy Office is the committee secretary. A task force has been set up \nunder the Ministry of Finance (MOF) with the permanent secretary (finance) as the chair and the \ndirector general of the Comptroller General's Department as the deputy chair. More recently, the \nfinance  minister  announced  that  creating  a  new  PPP  framework  is  one  of  the  key  policy \ninitiatives for 2010. A central PPP unit needs to be established with a clear mandate and \nmechanism for its operations. New PPP guidelines (the first draft) are posted on the MOF \nwebsite  (www.pdmo.mof.go.th).  Support  will  be  required  to  finalize  and  implement  these \nguidelines. Support will also be required for using the \u201cvalue-for-money\u201d concept, addressing \npossible viability gap funding issues, and providing templates for requests for proposals and \nstandard contracts and guidelines for contract management. \n \n9.  Development of bankable projects for private sector participation. The absence of \nrigorous project development criteria and methodologies is the \"missing link\" in developing \nbankable PPP projects. Sound project preparation capacity is essential for addressing the wide \nrange of complex economic, financial, technological, institutional, social, and environmental \nissues associated with large-scale infrastructure projects. For complex projects, especially those \ninvolving  private  sector  participation,  many  of  Thailand\u2019s  line  ministries  and  government \nagencies  need  additional  technical  expertise  to  (i)  conduct  detailed  project  appraisals  and \nfeasibility assessments; (ii) price and manage risks; (iii) institute transparent, conducive, and \neffective  regulatory  policies;  and  (iv)  create  institutional  mechanisms  for  managing  and \nmonitoring project implementation. Community consultations and the application of safeguard \nmechanisms  are  also  integral  preparatory  steps  for  projects  with  potential  social  and \nenvironmental  impacts.  Well-prepared  projects  can  substantially  reduce  the  risks  of  cost \noverruns and implementation delays, and offer greater prospects for private sector participation. \nThe government should ideally provide funding for the required project development activities \nand set up a project development facility. The project development expenses could eventually \nbe recovered from the successful bidder.  \n \n10.  Capacity  development.  The  capacity  of  national  and  line  ministries  needs  to  be \ndeveloped. The high-level committee and PPP task force, and future central PPP unit need \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nassistance with developing PPP policies and guidelines. Line ministries require assistance in \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \nstructuring  and  implementing  PPPs  (capacity  to  apply  value-for-money  principles,  review \nrequests  for  proposals  and  concession  agreements,  undertake  project  evaluation  and \nnegotiation, and monitor and manage project implementation).  \n ", "4   \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \n \n11.  Government stability. This represents a significant constraint. Since 2006, frequent \nchanges in government have resulted in regular ministerial change. Recurrent political turmoil \nremains a key risk to the near-term outlook. However, notwithstanding this period of political \nuncertainty, the country partnership strategy remains aligned with the government\u2019s policies and \naction  plans  to  promote  long-term  sustainable  growth  and  social  development,  outlined  in \nThailand\u2019s  National  Economic  and  Social  Development  Plan.  Despite  the  changes  in \ngovernment,  continuity  and  stability  in  the  core  economic  policy  agenda  supported  by \npermanent staff of the concerned economic ministries has been remarkable. During recent \npolitical  tension,  major  reforms  have  been  undertaken  and  supported  by  successive \ngovernments of very different political orientations. Across all policy and political perspectives, \nthe country is seen to be at a critical economic juncture, requiring a large-scale investment in \ninfrastructure across a broad range of sectors. The thrust of policy discussion is how much will \nbe financed by government and how much by the private sector. The general consensus is that \nprivate sector participation should be stronger to reduce the burden on the government in terms \nof debt financing. Limits to that burden are institutionalized in Thailand through debt ceilings in \nlaw, which reinforce the depth of commitment to PPPs and broad support across all policy and \npolitical participants. A breakdown in law and order during actual TA implementation could result \nin project delays, but political stability would ensure that this project receives highest priority \nover all other projects in Thailand.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The impact of the TA will be enhanced private sector investment in infrastructure during \nthe  medium  term  (starting  from  2012)  leading  to  improved  availability  and  quality  of \ninfrastructure in Thailand and thus contributing to economic growth. The outcome will be an \nimproved PPP-enabling environment with streamlined PPP processes and guidelines, as well \nas improved sector, legal, and regulatory frameworks for catalyzing PPP investments. The TA \nwill result in strengthened capacity within the PPP unit, line ministries, and other agencies \nresponsible for PPPs in Thailand.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $2.1 million equivalent. The outputs include \n(i) development of an enabling framework for PPPs in Thailand\u2014development of a national PPP \npolicy framework and a central PPP unit with a detailed mandate; identification of appropriate \ninstitutional, legal, and regulatory requirements; and recommendations for amendments to the \nRoyal Act on Private Participation in State Undertaking Act, 1992, to facilitate private sector \nparticipation;  (ii)  development  of  bankable  PPPs  for  private  sector  participation  by  helping \nstructure a project development facility, identify the appropriate agency where it should be \nlocated,  and  assess  the  extent  of  initial  resources  required  and  the  mechanism  for  its \nmanagement and operation; (iii) support for pilot transactions in priority infrastructure sectors by \ndeveloping  terms  of  reference  for  transaction  advisors  (legal,  technical,  financial,  and \nenvironmental)  to  assist  the  Mass  Rapid  Transit  Authority  in  preparing  bid  documents, \ninterfacing with potential bidders, evaluating bids, developing financial models, selecting project \ndevelopers, and negotiating with selected private concessionaires (support will also be provided \nfor developing a checklist for initial screening of projects); and (iv) development of institutional \ncapacity.  \n \n ", "  5 \n14.  Political  stability  and government  commitment  is  required  to catalyze  private  sector \ninvestments through PPP for infrastructure development, strengthen the enabling environment \nfor PPPs, develop consensus among different government agencies and stakeholders, and \ndevelop appropriate incentives for private sector participation. Risks include lack of political will \nto  promote  and  invite  private  sector  participation  through  PPPs,  delays  in  approval  and \nimplementation of legal and regulatory provisions, inadequate institutional capacity, and lack of \nbankable infrastructure projects. \n                                        \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The cost of TA outputs 1\u20133 (para. 13) is estimated at $1.4 million equivalent, of which $1 \nmillion equivalent will be financed on a grant basis by ADB's Technical Assistance Special Fund \n(TASF-other sources). The government will finance the remaining $400,000 equivalent in kind. \nThe cost for output 4, the capacity development component, is estimated at $700,000, of which \n$500,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge \nPartnership  Fund  and  administered  by  ADB.  The  government  will  finance  the  remaining \n$200,000 in kind. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are provided in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.
