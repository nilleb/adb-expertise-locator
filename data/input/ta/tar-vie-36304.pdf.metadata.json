During the 2003 Country Programming Mission of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), \nthe Government confirmed its request to ADB for technical assistance (TA) to prepare the \nAgriculture Science and Technology Project.1 The TA Fact-Finding Mission visited Viet Nam in \nJune 2003 and held discussions with stakeholders, including officials of relevant government \nagencies,  external  funding  agencies,  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  and  potential \nbeneficiaries. The Mission reached an understanding with the Government on the objectives, \nscope, and implementation arrangements for the TA. The TA is included in ADB\u2019s 2003 TA \nProgram for Viet Nam. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The agriculture sector in Viet Nam has grown rapidly at an average rate of 4.2% per \nannum during 1990\u20132000. From a net importer of rice in the late 1980s, Viet Nam has become \nthe second largest rice exporter in the world, and exports large quantities of commercial crops, \nincluding coffee, rubber, tea, pepper, groundnuts, and cashew nuts. This rapid growth was \nattributed  to  market-oriented  reforms  that  recognized  farm  households  as  the  key  unit  of \nproduction, liberalized land-use rights, and liberalized decision making on the purchase of inputs \nand sale of outputs. Science and technology (S&T) have played an important role in contributing \nto agricultural growth through improved agricultural inputs and technologies for farmers although \nthe past efforts focused more on yield improvement rather than quality improvement. \n \n3.  As part of its 10-year master plan and strategy (2001\u20132010) and to sustain growth, \nemployment, and exports in agriculture to help reduce rural poverty, the Government aims to (i) \nfoster agricultural diversification into higher-value products and markets; (ii) increase factor \nproductivity, value addition, and agro-processing; (iii) improve product quality for domestic and \nexport  markets;  (iv)  facilitate  technology  development  and  dissemination  through  improved \nresearch and extension; and (v) increase rural industries, infrastructure, and services. \n \n4.  More effective use of S&T for technological changes is required to ensure food security \nand promote agricultural diversification, and to improve the quality of high-value crops and \nlivestock  and  fishery  products  that  are  comparable  with  neighboring  countries  and  trade \ncompetitors. Access to new technologies by farmers and agro-based enterprises is essential \nwhen Viet Nam's agriculture is gradually shifting its focus from increased production volumes to \nincreased production values by identifying new production processes and innovative products \nand marketing. These technologies need to be developed and disseminated in partnership with \ncentral  and  provincial  agencies  of  the  Government,  private  enterprises,  farmers,  and \ninternational  agricultural  research  institutions.  Major  policy  and  structural  weaknesses  in \nagricultural research, extension, education, and market information systems in the public sector \nare being addressed under the Agriculture Sector Development Program (ASDP).2 Reforms in \nthese  institutions  will  also  require  investments  in  human  resources  and  infrastructure  for \nagriculture S&T that will enable them to contribute more significantly to agricultural growth in a \nchanging global environment. \n \n5.  The agricultural research system in Viet Nam includes 31 research institutes and 12 \nuniversities, and involves five ministries: the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet version) on 20 September 2002. \n2  ADB. 2002.

Manila. \n ", "2   \n(MARD), the Ministry of Education and Training (MOET), the Ministry of Industry (MOI), the \nMinistry of Fisheries (MOFI), and the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST). MARD is the \nagency primarily responsible for agricultural research since the majority of research institutes \nand 2 of the 12 agricultural universities are under its supervision. Private universities and \ncolleges are also involved in agricultural research. The regional distribution of public research \ninstitutes and their stations is rather uneven, with about 80% of them in the Red River and \nMekong deltas. This situation makes it difficult for the institutes to address poverty reduction and \nenvironmental issues in remote and upland regions where research institutes and their stations \ndo not exist. Under ASDP, the Government will establish new research centers in the central \ncoast and northern highland regions. Of a total of about 2,300 researchers of the agricultural \nresearch institutes, about 40% have postgraduate degrees. To improve agricultural research in \npublic  and  private  sectors,  the  upgrading  of  technical  capabilities  of  researchers  and  the \nprovision  of  increased  opportunities  for  advanced  education  for  the  researchers  and  new \ngraduates are urgently needed. \n \n6.  The  extension  system  in  Viet  Nam  consists  of  four  levels:  the  central  extension \ninstitutions  based  in  Hanoi,  the  provincial  extension  network, the  district  network,  and  the \ngrassroots or commune-level network. In addition, there are private service providers, including \nfarmer associations, NGOs, and private volunteers. At the central level, the Department of \nAgriculture and Forestry Extension (DAFE) under MARD has overall responsibility for planning, \nbudgeting,  and  monitoring  of  agricultural  extension  services  for  the  whole  country.  The \nGovernment recognizes the need for strengthening the local extension networks, including \nprivate service providers, and the linkage between farmers and agro-based enterprises, and \nplans  to  add  about  5,000  extension  personnel  by  2005,  including  substantial  increases  in \nwomen and staff of indigenous people. \n \n7.  Although the Government receives assistance in agriculture from major external funding \nagencies, including ADB, the Australian Agency for International Development, the Food and \nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations, the German Agency for Technical Cooperation, \nand the World Bank, the agricultural research and extension system in Viet Nam generally lacks \nsufficient funds to carry out their assigned tasks. For instance, public spending on agricultural \nresearch constitutes only 0.15% of total Government expenditures in Viet Nam as compared \nwith the average of about 0.51% in other countries in Asia. Physical facilities and equipment for \nagriculture S&T have often deteriorated due to lack of funding and maintenance, and must be \nupgraded and modernized to meet future challenges. Scientific cooperation and coordination \namong institutions also need to be promoted to ensure optimal use of scarce financial and \nhuman resources, and to avoid duplication of efforts. Increased investment expenditures will be \nrequired for these purposes. \n \n8.  In its policy on agriculture S&T, the Government aims to (i) increase investments for the \napplication of new agricultural technologies, (ii) promote the role of the private sector in the \nproduction of improved planting materials and in research and extension, and (iii) support \nuniversities in their activities for agricultural research and education. The Government also \nintends to develop some of the lead universities or training centers as international centers for \nspecialized extension training and for the training of trainers, particularly for other countries of \nthe Greater Mekong Subregion.3 \n \n                                                \n3  The Greater Mekong Subregion includes Cambodia, Yunnan Province of the People's Republic of China, Lao \nPeople's Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam. ", "3 \n9.  To achieve these policy objectives, collaboration among a wide range of stakeholders, \nincluding the Government, the private sector, and external funding agencies, will be required. In \n1997, MARD established the International Support Group (ISG) with external funding agencies \nin Viet Nam to effectively coordinate and utilize external resources in the agriculture sector. The \nISG works on a small trust fund contributed by a few donors, and facilitates the information flow \nthrough newsletters, a website and periodic meetings. The ISG is a small but a potentially \npowerful group, representing funding agencies, civil society organizations, and most ministries \nconcerned  with  policies  and  programs  relating  to  agriculture  and  rural  development.  The \nproposed  TA  will  help  strengthen  the  ISG,  and  contribute  to  coordinated  efforts  for  other \nthematic partnerships in the agriculture sector. \n \n10.  In March 2003, ADB assisted the Government in formulating a sector road map for \nagriculture S&T in Viet Nam based on dialogue with key policy makers and stakeholders in the \nsector.4 In line with the long-term development strategy of the Government, this road map called \nfor (i) detailed analysis and inventory assessments focused on the agriculture S&T systems in \nViet Nam; (ii) increased emphasis on client-oriented research and extension; (iii) partnerships \nwith  the  private  sector,  NGOs,  and  international  agricultural  research  centers  and  service \nproviders; and (iv) provision of comprehensive and quality services with increased focus on \ndisadvantaged farm households. The road map also stressed the need for a wider consensus \non the long-term objectives and strategy, and for investment in the upgrading of physical and \nhuman resources for agriculture S&T. The TA has been formulated in line with the road map \nand  will  contribute  to  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  for  Viet  Nam,5  which  aims  at \nsupporting the country's sustainable economic growth by raising agricultural productivity and \npromoting private agro-enterprises. The TA is essential in preparing specific components of \nADB's support for agriculture S&T in Viet Nam, and will involve key stakeholders to ensure \nsynergy with other projects of ADB and other external funding agencies through its support for \nthe ISG. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n11.  The  TA  will  help  the  Government  prepare  a  detailed  proposal  for  strengthening \nagriculture S&T in Viet Nam, thereby contributing to the country's sustainable economic growth \nand reduction in rural poverty. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.  To achieve its objectives, the TA will (i) conduct an analytical review of the systems, \nnetworks,  institutions,  budget,  and  expenditures  related  to  agriculture  S&T  in  Viet  Nam, \nincluding agricultural research, extension, education, training, and market information systems; \n(ii) identify potential for and critical constraints on the country's agriculture S&T development; \n(iii) establish detailed inventories of physical and human resources for agricultural research, \nextension, and education; (iv) examine alternative means and policy options to promote private \nsector  participation  in  agriculture  S&T,  including  intellectual  property  rights,  taxation,  and \nbiotechnology; (v) assess the effectiveness of mass media, and information and communication \ntechnologies in agriculture S&T; (vi) evaluate past and ongoing external assistance in the \nagriculture  sector  and  identify  lessons  learned;  (vii)  prepare  detailed  investment  proposals \n                                                \n4  ADB.

The  TA  needs  to  cover  the  relevant  agricultural  research  institutes,  organizations \ninvolved in agricultural extension and market information systems, and universities and colleges \nto formulate a comprehensive picture of agriculture S&T in Viet Nam. As these institutes and \norganizations are being restructured under the ongoing ASDP (footnote 2), the progress of \nASDP  implementation  needs  to  be  fully  taken  into  account  in  an  analytical  review  of  the \nagriculture S&T systems under the TA. Close interactions need to be maintained throughout the \nTA with the relevant government agencies (including MARD, MOET, MOI, MOFI and MOST), \nthe private sector, and external funding agencies, and through the ISG. The TA also needs to \nreflect the situation and trends of domestic and international markets for agricultural inputs and \noutputs in determining priorities in agriculture S&T that are responsive to national development \ngoals. \n \n14.  The proposed ensuing loan project will be formulated based on the investment needs \nand timetable to be agreed with the Government, and will complement the ongoing and planned \nactivities of other external funding agencies and NGOs. The project was initially identified in \nconjunction with the ongoing ASDP, and will be formulated under the TA as the policy and \ninstitutional reform measures are implemented under the ASDP. The summary initial poverty \nand social analysis was based on the data and information compiled during the processing of \nASDP  (Appendix  2).  The  ensuing  project  will  aim  at  strengthening  the  institutions  and \norganizations  involved  in  agriculture  S&T  through  investment  in  training  of  their  staff, \nrehabilitation and modernization of facilities and equipment, and improvement of information \nnetworks.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1.125 million equivalent, comprising $655,000 in \nforeign exchange and $470,000 equivalent in local currency costs. ADB will provide $900,000 \nequivalent to finance the entire foreign exchange costs and part of the local currency costs, \namounting to $245,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from the Japan \nSpecial Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The balance of the local currency costs, \namounting  to  $225,000  equivalent,  will  be  met  by  the  Government  to  cover  office \naccommodations,  counterpart  staff  support,  facilities  for  seminars  and  meetings,  other \nadministrative expenses, and part of local transport costs. A government representative will be \ninvited as an observer for contract negotiations. The detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 3. \nThe Government has been advised that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to financing \nany ensuing loan project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  The Executing Agency for the TA will be MARD, which is the principal ministry for the \nagriculture sector in Viet Nam, and supervises the majority of agricultural research institutes and \norganizations involved in agricultural extension and market information systems. MARD is also \nthe executing agency for the ASDP and the related advisory TA to support the implementation \nof the policy reforms under the ASDP. A project coordination group will be established to \noversee TA implementation. The group will be headed by the vice minister of MARD for S&T, ", "5 \nand will comprise representatives from MARD, MOST, MOET, MOI, MOFI, the Ministry of \nPlanning and Investment, the Ministry of Finance, and the State Bank of Viet Nam. The project \ncoordination  group  will  be  responsible  for  (i)  overall  policy  direction  and  guidance,  (ii) \ncoordination within the Government, (iii) resolution of outstanding TA implementation issues, \nand (iv) provision of comments on major consultant outputs. In addition, a project preparation \nunit,  headed  by  a  director-level  official,  will  be  established  in  MARD  to  ensure  smooth \nimplementation of the TA. This unit will consist of representatives from various departments of \nMARD, including the Agriculture Projects Management Board; the Department for Science, \nTechnology  and  Product  Quality;  DAFE;  the  Organization  and  Personnel  Department;  the \nInternational  Cooperation  Department;  the  Information  Center  for  Agriculture  and  Rural \nDevelopment; other relevant agencies of the Government; and the TA consultant team. The \nproject preparation unit will meet at least once a month and will report to the project coordination \ngroup and ADB on implementation progress. \n \n17.  The TA will apply a multistakeholder participatory diagnosis and design approach for \nproject preparation, and will be implemented over 9 months commencing in January 2004 with \ncompletion expected in October 2004. A total of 86 person-months of consulting services will be \nrequired under the TA, comprising 33 person-months of international and 53 person-months of \ndomestic  consultancy  in  agriculture  sector  management,  research  management,  extension \nmanagement, agricultural education, extension training, agricultural market information, financial \nand economic analyses, social development, environment, and institutional development. The \ninternational agriculture sector management specialist will lead the TA consultant team. An \ninternational consulting firm will provide all the international and domestic consulting services \nrequired for the TA. The consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB's \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging \ndomestic  consultants.  The  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  will  be  used  for  the \nselection, and the technical proposals invited from the shortlisted consulting firms will be in \nADB\u2019s  simplified  formats.  The  consultant  will  purchase  the  necessary  office  equipment  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Equipment procured under the TA will be \nhanded over to the Government at TA completion. \n \n18.  Stakeholder  workshops  will  be  organized  at  least  three  occasions\u2014the  first  at  the \ninception, and the next two to discuss the draft interim report and the draft final report prepared \nunder the TA. The consultant will prepare (i) an inception report including a detailed work \nprogram, to be submitted within 1 month of the start of the TA and to be discussed at the initial \ntripartite review meeting; (ii) an interim report to present preliminary findings based on the TA's \ninterim results, to be submitted by the end of the fourth month of the TA and to be discussed at \nthe interim tripartite review meeting; (iii) a draft final report about 2 months before the final report \nand to be discussed at national- and provincial-level workshops and the final tripartite review \nmeeting; and (iv) a final report upon completion of the TA. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $900,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Viet Nam for preparing the Agriculture Science and Technology Project, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nOUTLINE TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR CONSULTANTS \n \n1.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n \nSector identified as a national priority in country  Sector identified as a national priority in country poverty  \npoverty analysis?   Yes.  partnership agreement (PPA)?   Yes. \n \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Viet Nam: \n \nThe agriculture sector accounts for about 22% of the national gross domestic product (GDP), 60% of the total labor \nforce, and 30% of the country's exports. The PPA of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) with the Government \nidentifies the following strategies to reduce poverty: sustainable economic growth by reforming agricultural research \nand  extension,  increased  private  investment in  agriculture  processing, and  agricultural  market support.  Major \nopportunities exist for increasing agriculture productivity and growth, and ensuring food security and job opportunities, \nthereby contributing to reduction in rural poverty. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis        Proposed Classification: Economic growth \n \n \nRural poverty is widespread in Viet Nam, particularly in remote and highland areas. The country's poverty incidence is \nestimated at about 37% in 2000, and 85% of the poor live in rural areas. Low agriculture productivity and weak \ncompetitiveness in markets are major explanatory factors for rural poverty in Viet Nam. Poor people in rural Viet Nam \nhave limited access to land and other productive resources, and are vulnerable to natural disasters such as flood and \ndrought. A detailed poverty analysis is not relevant for the technical assistance (TA) as no specific targeting of the \npoor in certain areas or locations will be required under the ensuing project. However, the TA will carry out social and \npoverty assessments for the project in accordance with ADB's standard practices and guidelines to assess the \npotential impact of the project on gender, indigenous peoples, and rural poverty, and to improve the project design. \nThe TA will build on the country poverty analysis and sector work prepared during the formulation of ADB's \nAgriculture Sector Development Program (loans 1972 and 1973) and other relevant studies and reports on the \ncountry's poverty situation. \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nStakeholder analysis:  \n \nUnder the TA, a series of stakeholder consultation meetings will be required at regional centers (tentatively at eight \nlocations in the northern, central, and southern regions) with farmer representatives, local government agencies, \nnongovernment organizations, and the private sector. The International Support Group (ISG), which was established \nby the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development to ensure effective coordination and consultation between the \nGovernment and external funding agencies, will be effectively used to facilitate dialogue with other external funding \nagencies. National-level workshops will be organized at major milestones of the TA. \n \nParticipation strategy required: \n \nThe detailed strategy for the participation of key stakeholders in the TA activities will be formulated at TA inception as \npart of the work program for the TA. \n \nD.
