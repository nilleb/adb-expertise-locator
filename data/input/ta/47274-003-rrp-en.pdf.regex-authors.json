THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans to \nthe Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Secondary Green Cities Development Project. The \nreport also describes (i) the proposed administration of grants to be provided by the Global \nEnvironment Facility (GEF) and the Urban Climate Change Resilience Trust Fund (UCCRTF)1 \nunder  the  Urban  Financing  Partnership  Facility  (UFPF)  for  the  Secondary  Green  Cities \nDevelopment Project, and (ii) the proposed administration of technical assistance (TA) to be \nprovided by the GEF and the UCCRTF under the UFPF to the Government of Viet Nam for the \nMainstreaming Climate Resilience and Environmental Protection for Secondary Green Cities \nDevelopment, and if the Board approves the proposed loans, I, acting under the authority \ndelegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the grants and TA. \n \n2.  The project will support environmentally sustainable and socially inclusive development in \nthe  cities  of  Vinh  Yen,  Hue,  and  Ha  Giang  in  Viet  Nam  to  enhance  their  economic \ncompetitiveness. It will (i) control urban storm water runoff and reduce flood risks, (ii) improve \nsanitation for public health, (iii) enhance green landscaping and public amenities, (iv) upgrade \nurban road networks and their connectivity, and (v) promote public participation in planning. The \nproject will demonstrate green and climate-resilient development approaches that will be scaled \nup for nationwide secondary green city development in Viet Nam. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Development constraints. Because of rapid urbanization, 31.1 million people live in cities \nin Viet Nam, and they contributed about 70% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product in 2015 \n($193.4 billion).2 Although a structural shift from agriculture to industry and services is driving Viet \nNam\u2019s rapid growth, the country\u2019s urbanization is uneven. Unlike the five centrally administered \ncities,  the  development  of  secondary  cities  is  lagging.3 In  these  cities,  less  than  60%  of \nhouseholds are connected to the water supply system, only 10% of their urban wastewater is \ntreated by a centralized system, and domestic wastewater treatment relies heavily on poorly \nmaintained household septic tanks. The lack of proper storm water management has reduced the \ncapacity of drainage systems and causes frequent flooding. Many urban road networks reach \ntheir capacity and have difficulty accommodating an increasing number of vehicles. Climate \nchange also severely impacts secondary cities. By 2100, a projected sea-level rise of 100 \ncentimeters could flood a 40,000-square-kilometer area and affect 9 million\u201311 million people. \nMeanwhile, inland cities will suffer from lack of water resources because of the reduced annual \nflow of major rivers.4 In addition to the government\u2019s financial decentralization policy, that has \nreduced budget transfers to secondary cities5, infrastructure development in these cities relies \n                                                \n1  Financing partners are the Rockefeller Foundation and the governments of Switzerland and the United Kingdom. \n2  Government of Viet Nam, General Statistics Office of Viet Nam. 2016. Statistical Yearbook of Vietnam 2015. Ha Noi. \nIn 2015, Viet Nam has population of 91.7 million. Urbanization is increasing at a rate of 4.0% per year, much faster \nthan the national population growth rate of 1.1%. \n3  The five centrally administered cities are Can Tho, Da Nang, Hai Phong, Ha Noi, and Ho Chi Minh City. A secondary \ncity generally has a population of 50,000\u2013300,000. \n4  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2009.

Ho Chi Minh City. \n5  Because of the government\u2019s financial decentralization policy, many local governments have had to confront large \nfinancial deficits stemming from reduced fiscal budget transfers and limited sources of their own fiscal revenue. \n \n ", "2 \nheavily on public investment as their limited size and coverage cannot support economies of scale \nor cost recovery. Yet, their weak institutional capacity to plan, design, and prioritize investments \nprevents the efficient use of public funds and application of innovative ideas. \n \n4.  Government effort and challenges. Viet Nam\u2019s Socio-Economic Development Strategy, \n2011\u20132020 and its Socio-Economic Development Plan, 2016\u20132020 aim to sustain economic \ngrowth rates while achieving social inclusiveness and environmental protection.6 This has led the \ngovernment to issue the specific sector policies\u2014the National Orientation Master Plan to 2025 \nand the National Program on Urban Development\u2014to guide efficient, sustainable, and equitable \nurbanization in the future.7 However, secondary cities\u2019 slow development prevents them from \ncontributing to the national socioeconomic growth, especially by (i) providing job opportunities \nand livable environments for locals and migrant workers, and (ii) minimizing income disparities by \nsupporting the growth of middle-income groups. \n \n5.  The government requested assistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB), which \nhas been supporting the comprehensive basic urban infrastructure development in secondary \ncities since 2003.8 ADB has found that responding to a city\u2019s complex socioeconomic and financial \nconstraints requires strategic support in upstream city planning and the identification of effective \ninvestments. The government and  ADB jointly selected Vinh Yen, Hue, and Ha Giang as \ndemonstration  cities  because  they  represent  different  socioeconomic  characteristics, \ndevelopment constraints, and geographic locations. ADB supported the preparation of a GrEEEn \ncity action plan (GCAP) for each city, which piloted an integrated planning and prioritized \ninvestment  approach  to  boost  their  economic  competitiveness,  while  incorporating  social \ninclusiveness, climate resilience, and environmental sustainability in infrastructure planning and \ndevelopment. 9 \n \n6.  Vinh Yen, the capital of Vinh Phuc province with a population of 105,800 as of 2016, is \none of the satellite cities forming the greater Ha Noi cluster. Because of its strategic location, the \ncity  is  experiencing  rapid  economic  growth  led  by  foreign  direct  investment  in  automobile \nmanufacturing.10 However, Vinh Yen has failed to take full advantage of its industrial structure \nand provide a better quality of life for its people. The GCAP identified the following priorities: (i) \nregain  economic  competitiveness  by  linking  local  industries  to  emerging  opportunities  and \ndeveloping academic institutions that will support skilled labor to attract industries that will \ndiversify its value chain;11 (ii) expand the limited sanitation coverage and upgrade the combined \nsewerage system, which currently serves only 30% of households; and (iii) improve livability for \nthe local population and migrant workers by increasing public green spaces from 4.8 square \nmeters per person to the government\u2019s target of 5.0\u20137.0 square meters per person. \n                                                \n6  Government of Viet Nam, Ministry of Planning and Investment. 2011.

As the capital of Thua Thien Hue province, Hue is a historic tourism city with a population \nof  355,095  (2016).  The  city  struggles  to  balance  historical  asset  conservation  and  urban \ndevelopment.12 Despite a rapid increase in the number of tourist arrivals, the provincial per capita \ngross regional product of about $1,881 remains lower than the national average. Hue\u2019s GCAP \ntargets the continued development of the tourism industry, while ensuring better quality of life for \nlocal people, by (i) improving the environment in and around the Hue Citadel, where an insufficient \nwastewater and drainage system (only 30% coverage) causes frequent flooding; (ii) developing \na new urban area on the east bank of the Huong River to reduce development pressures on the \nhistorical conservation areas on the west bank; and (iii) mitigating the impacts of rapidly increasing \nroad traffic and fragmented road connections, as well as associated traffic safety concerns.  \n \n8.  Ha Giang, the capital of Ha Giang province with a population of 55,900 (2016), is on the \ncountry\u2019s northern border with the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) at the confluence of the Mien \nand Lo Rivers. The landlocked city remains economically isolated because it has not realized its \neconomic growth potential as a border city with the PRC.13 The GCAP proposes (i) constructing \nwastewater and drainage systems in the city center to mitigate seasonal flooding and water \npollution; (ii) strengthening the river embankment against erosion and annual flooding, which \ncauses an average economic loss of $0.6 million per year; and (iii) improving the capacity and \nconnectivity of the urban road network to support increasing cross-border trade with the PRC and \nmore than 489,000 tourists per year to the Dong Van Karst Plateau, a member of the United \nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization Global Geoparks Network. \n \n9.  ADB\u2019s value addition. ADB added value based on its lengthy experience in supporting \nsecondary cities in various geographic areas of Viet Nam. ADB\u2019s proposed solution builds on its \nknowledge work and addresses complex secondary city development issues through TA and loan \nprojects. The project components were selected based on ADB\u2019s capacity development TA,14 \nwhich  conceptualized,  analyzed,  and  integrated  green  and  climate-resilient  development \napproaches in cities. Project preparatory TA15 refined the GCAPs and prioritized investment for \ncity development. Parallel with project implementation, the attached TA will leverage the project \nimpact to (i) mainstream green and climate-resilient development through national policy and \nregulatory reform, (ii) update the GCAPs and improve project cities\u2019 master plans, and (iii) \nreplicate the approach in other secondary cities in Viet Nam. The project also incorporates \nlessons from previous ADB projects in Viet Nam, including the need to (i) apply project readiness \nfilters to minimize start-up delays; (ii)  show strong commitment on tariff reform to recover \noperation and maintenance (O&M) costs, and ensure the financial sustainability; (iii) promote \nprovincial government agencies\u2019 strong ownership and early involvement in project design and \nthe management; and (iv) provide loan and grant resources to operationalize a revolving fund.16 \n \n10.  Special features and strategic fit. The project will help the three cities consider design \nalternatives  and  demonstrate  innovative  green  infrastructure  solutions  by  (i)  adopting  an \necological and climate-resilient design for embankments and urban drainage channels that will \nminimize concrete structures, balance engineering measures with river ecosystem conservation, \nand enhance public amenities; (ii) including green functions in road designs to allow water filtration \n                                                \n12 The Hue Citadel and other physical cultural resources were recognized as World Heritage sites in 1993. \n13 In 2015, the per capita gross regional product in Ha Giang province was $1,712. \n14 ADB. 2012.

Activities directly supporting communities vulnerable to climate risk in Hue and Vinh Yen \nwill enable the project to reach the people in need through a participatory approach. The attached \nTA will demonstrate an innovative financial mechanism for Hue to protect its infrastructure assets \nagainst climate change and disaster risk. The project aligns with ADB\u2019s country partnership \nstrategy, 2016\u20132020 for Viet Nam. It is also consistent with ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy \n2020, Urban Operational Plan, and Environment Operational Directions as it promotes knowledge \nsolutions and the scaling up of climate adaptation, as well as competitive, inclusive, and green \ncity development and better quality of life through a climate-resilient city.17 \n \nB.

The government  will  make  70%  of the \nconcessional loan available to the PPCs of Ha Giang, Thua Thien Hue, and Vinh Phuc through \nbudgetary grant allocation and will onlend the remaining amount under respective subsidiary loan \nagreements, all upon terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB.20 The government will make \n100% of the regular loan available to the Thua Thien Hue and Vinh Phuc PPCs through onlending \nunder respective subsidiary loan agreements, all upon terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB. \nThe GEF and UCCRTF grants will be fully passed on to the PPCs under respective sub-grant \nagreements. The government and each PPC will sign the respective sub-loan and sub-grant \nagreements with the same terms and conditions as the original ADB loans and GEF and UCCRTF \ngrants. The PPCs will assume the foreign exchange and interest variation risks of the ADB loans. \nThe government has assured ADB that the PPCs will provide counterpart funds necessary for the \nproject in a timely manner, including additional funding required for any shortfall of funds that may \noccur during project implementation.

ATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n20.  The transaction TA is estimated to cost $14.1 million, of which $10.8 million will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the GEF and $2.0 million will be financed on a grant basis by the \nUCCRTF (footnote 1). ADB and the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MONRE) \nwill  jointly  administer  the  TA.21 The  TA  outputs  will  promote  the  green  and  resilient  city \ndevelopment approach at different levels of government through (i) the formulation of a national \nregulatory  framework  for  an  enabling  environment  for  sustainable  and  resilient  cities;  (ii) \ndemonstration of sustainable and resilient development in Ha Giang, Hue, and Vinh Yen; (iii) \npreparation and testing of innovative climate risk financing in Hue; and (iv) enhancement and \nreplication of integrated and resilient environmental planning in selected cities and provinces. The \nTA will be implemented from 2018 to 2022. MONRE will serve as the executing agency and will \ncoordinate with the three project cities, other PPCs for replication activities, and the line ministries \nfor national regulatory and policy reforms. The national government has mandated the MONRE \nto accumulate experience, and coordinate and promote national climate resilience in Viet Nam \nthrough  the  TA  activities.  MONRE  and  the  provincial  and  city  governments  will  provide \ncounterpart support in the form of staff, local data collection and coordination, and other in-kind \ncontributions. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n \n21.  The project will ensure that the climate-resilient and green infrastructure design and \napproaches (para. 10) complement projects funded by other development partners, collectively \n                                                \n21 Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). Of the GEF portion, \n$6,256,881 will come from the GEF Trust Fund and $4,566,210 from the GEF Special Climate Change Fund. The \nTA has four outputs, of which three will be administered by ADB and the one will be administered by MONRE. \n \n ", "8 \nresulting in a stronger overall climate adaptation impact.22 The analysis confirmed the project is \ntechnically viable after a detailed examination of compatibility  with Viet Nam\u2019s engineering \nguidelines, traffic demand and urban storm runoff projections, and wastewater generation and \nrequired treated effluent quality. An alternative analysis considered cost effectiveness (covering \noperating costs), the use of appropriate technology within operating agencies, and the reduction \nof negative social and environmental impacts. The project will provide training to ensure the \nsustainable O&M of project facilities. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n22.  Economic analysis. An economic analysis concluded that the project is economically \nviable. Economic internal rates of return were computed at 16.7% for the overall project, 18.8% \nfor the Ha Giang subproject, 21.3% for the Hue subproject, and 9.2% for the Vinh Yen subproject. \nThe project\u2019s economic benefits include (i) travel time and vehicle operation cost savings from \nimproved roads and network connectivity, (ii) health-related expenditure savings from improved \nsanitation services, and (iii) higher revenue from tourism and business-related foreign travelers.23 \n \n23.  Financial analysis. A financial evaluation of the only revenue-generating wastewater \ntreatment system in Vinh Yen indicated that the government will be unable to achieve full cost \nrecovery through wastewater tariff collection.24 The financial internal rate of return is \u20133.7%. The \nfinancial impact assessment for this component demonstrated that the Vinh Yen PPC and the city \npeople\u2019s committee (CPC) have the financial capacity to complete the project and cover O&M \ncosts. The analysis indicated that the system will generate revenue from the projected wastewater \ntariffs to cover O&M costs. The financial impact assessment for the entire project ensured fiscal \nsustainability during implementation and operation until 2042. An assessment of the three PPCs\u2019 \nfinancial capacity indicated that annual counterpart funds and interest during construction will \naccount for 0.1%\u20134.7% of the projected fiscal surplus, and debt service during operation will be \n0.1%\u20132.6%. The assessment also concluded that the Vinh Yen, Hue, and Ha Giang CPCs have \nthe capacity to finance O&M during operation. The fiscal impact of O&M costs on the CPCs\u2019 fiscal \nbudget was estimated at 1.0%\u20134.6%, indicating sufficient financial capacity. Loan assurances \nmitigate fiscal risks with regard to the timely appropriation of counterpart funds, wastewater tariff \ncollection, and operational sustainability.25 \n \nC.  Governance \n \n24.  All PPCs have experience in projects funded by international financial institutions and \nbilateral  development  partners.  They  will  supervise  the  implementing  agencies  under  the \nprovincial governments (Vinh Phuc and Thua Thien Hue) and the city government (Ha Giang). \nProcurement capacity assessments concluded that, with the agreed mitigation actions, the Vinh \nPhuc Provincial Foreign Concessional Loans Project Management Office, Thua Thien Hue \nDepartment of Planning and Investment, and Ha Giang CPC have adequate capacity to conduct \nprocurement activities following ADB guidelines. The financial management risk is substantial. A \n                                                \n22 These include (i) a proposed provincial flood control and mitigation project funded by the World Bank and a \nwastewater treatment system funded by the Japan International Cooperation Agency in Vinh Yen; (ii) the construction \nof a wastewater treatment system in Hue, also funded by the Japan International Cooperation Agency; and (iii) a \nproposed wastewater treatment system funded by Danish International Development Assistance in Ha Giang. \n23 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 Government of Viet Nam. 2014. Decree on Water Drainage and Wastewater Treatment. Ha Noi (No. 80/2014/ND-\nCP). ADB and other international development partners recognize the difficulty of achieving full cost recovery in the \nwastewater subsector in Viet Nam. The recommended levels of wastewater tariff should recover O&M costs. \n25 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \ntime-bound action plan was agreed upon to mitigate risks through (i) loan covenants on the timely \nappropriation of counterpart funds and anticorruption measures, (ii) periodic public financial \nmanagement training, and (iii) the engagement of a qualified auditing firm. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption \nPolicy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and the \nPPCs. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM \n(footnote 19). \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n25.  The project will benefit about 116,000 households (12,308 in Ha Giang, 78,417 in Hue, \nand 25,314 in Vinh Yen), including about 6,096 poor and near-poor households. The project is \nclassified as a targeted intervention (Sustainable Development Goals 6 and 11). Its social impact \nwill be positive and will improve the quality of life of the people in Vinh Yen, Hue, and Ha Giang. \nThe project will boost the resilience of vulnerable groups and reduce poverty through improved \naccess to climate-resilient urban infrastructure services. It will also enable community groups to \nparticipate in the GCAP planning, implementation, and monitoring. \n \n26.  The  project  is  classified  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  A  gender  assessment \nidentified low women\u2019s participation in public decision-making as a key gender issue. Impact and \nservice  disruptions  related  to  climate  change  directly  affect  women  as  they  have  primary \nresponsibility for household and community water supply and sanitation management. Poor \nsewerage and drainage heightens risks and flooding impacts, such as the disruption of work and \nlivelihoods resulting in loss of income, proportionately higher loss of assets and property among \nthe poor and households headed by women, and an increased risk of communicable diseases. \nThe gender action plan includes (i) strategies to promote equal opportunities for women to \nparticipate in and benefit from the project, and to increase women\u2019s representation in decision-\nmaking; (ii) targets for women\u2019s participation in project management units (PMUs) and capacity \nbuilding training sessions; and (iii) gender-responsive and pro-poor principles in the revised \nGCAPs and community-led activities. The PPCs will collect gender-disaggregated data to monitor \nprogress against the gender action plan. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n27.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are discussed in paras. 27\u201331.26 \n \n28.  Environment (category B). The PPCs conducted an initial environmental examination \nfor the three cities and uploaded these to the ADB website in May 2017.27 The most sensitive \nsites are the lakes, rivers, and canals that will be dredged and/or whose banks will be stabilized. \nNo project component will encroach on legally protected sites.28 Construction impacts (including \ndust, noise, temporary deterioration of surface water quality, and traffic disturbance with impacts \non  community  safety)  will  be  temporary,  short-term,  and  likely  to  occur  during  the  peak \nconstruction period. The project is not anticipated to generate significant adverse environmental \nimpacts during operation. Cumulative greenhouse gas emissions from the project facilities will not \nexceed ADB\u2019s threshold of 100,000 tons per year. Mitigation measures for identified impacts are \nin the environmental management plans (EMPs), and adherence to the EMPs will reduce residual \n                                                \n26  ADB.

However, no work will be allowed in the core and buffer zone of protected sites. \n ", "10 \nimpact significance to acceptable levels. The PMUs will oversee EMP implementation, and their \ncapacity will be strengthened by the appointment of environment staff and supervision consultants \nduring  implementation.  The  PPCs  held  formal  and  informal  focus  group  discussions  for \nstakeholder consultations and defined grievance redress mechanisms. \n \n29.  The project\u2019s climate risk without mitigation is classified as medium. Key climate risks \ninclude sea-level rise (Hue) and increased precipitation intensity and variability (all cities). The \nproject will significantly contribute to the cities\u2019 climate resilience by implementing the key climate \nresilience priorities in the GCAPs, the Vinh Phuc Climate Action Plan (2015\u20132030), and the \nClimate Action Plan for Hue City.29 Community-led activities will target the most vulnerable \ncommunities in Hue and Vinh Yen. \n \n30.  Involuntary resettlement (category A). The project will acquire 58.4 ha of land, of which \n43.4 ha is agricultural. The project will affect 2,014 households (10,099 people) to varying degrees, \nwith land acquisition and house relocation significantly affecting 610 households (3,058 people). \nADB prepared two resettlement plans: one each for the Hue and Vinh Yen subprojects, and a \nresettlement and ethnic minority development plan (REMDP) for the Ha Giang subproject in line \nwith the Safeguard Policy Statement. The government approved and disclosed the plans to the \naffected people and uploaded them to the ADB website in May 2017. The PPCs will finalize the \nplans based on the detailed measurement survey at the detailed engineering design stage, \ndisclose them to the affected people, and submit them to ADB for approval. The PPCs will pay \ncompensation for lost assets and resettlement allowances to the affected people, and will arrange \nlivelihood rehabilitation in line with the resettlement plans and REMDP. Consultants will monitor \nand evaluate Implementation of the resettlement plans and REMDP internally and externally. The \nPMUs will have full-time land acquisition and resettlement staff who will support compliance with \nADB safeguard requirements. Monitoring and evaluation reports will be prepared semiannually \nduring implementation and annually for 2 years after resettlement completion in each subproject. \nThe project has set up a transparent grievance redress mechanism that will provide meaningful \nconsultation and trigger remedial action. \n \n31.  Indigenous peoples (category B). In Ha Giang, ethnic minorities represent 41% of the \npopulation, mainly Tay (27%), Dao (6%), and Hoa (3%). While ethnic minorities in urban wards \nare integrated into the mainstream, those in rural communes still form distinct cultural and \nlinguistic communities, and their poverty rate is significantly higher than that of their urban \ncounterparts. The Ha Giang subproject will partially affect about 73 ethnic minorities. The REMDP \noutlining the issues and actions for ethnic minority integration for the Ha Giang subproject has \nbeen approved and disclosed by Ha Giang CPC to the affected persons. It was uploaded to the \nADB website in May 2017. The project has no negative impact on Hue or Vinh Yen, which do not \nhave any concentrated area of ethnic minorities. \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n32.  The project\u2019s overall risk is moderate, but tariff reform, domestic resource mobilization, \nPMU staff capacity, and land acquisition and resettlement pose are substantial risks. Significant \nrisks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the risk \nassessment and risk management plan.30 \n                                                \n29 Vinh Phuc Department of Natural Resources and Environment. 2011.
