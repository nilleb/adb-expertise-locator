Cross-border tax evasion and avoidance undermine public finances and trust in the \nfairness  of  the  tax  system.1 International  cooperation  among  tax  authorities  through  the \nexchange  of  information  is  essential  in  addressing  cross-border  tax  evasion.  The  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  has  engaged  with  tax  authorities  in  ADB  developing  member \ncountries (DMCs), through regional conferences and training seminars on tax issues, to identify \nchallenges these authorities face. Tax authorities that are members of the Study Group on Tax \nAdministration and Research (SGATAR), a regional cooperation forum for tax authorities in Asia \nand the Pacific, have noted that the risk of cross-border tax evasion increases in line with \ndevelopment of the regional economy. They have also observed that the regulatory frameworks \nand capacity of tax authorities to address cross-border tax evasion remain limited, and that \nfurther coordination among the tax authorities is needed. This technical assistance (TA) will \nconduct regional training courses, designed on the basis of a capacity development needs \nassessment, to enhance the capacity and regional cooperation of tax authorities. The project \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Rapid  globalization  of  financial  services,  investment,  and  trade  has  significantly \nimpacted the revenue base of developing countries. Cross-border financial transactions are \nincreasingly used to aggressively avoid and evade taxes, resulting in reduced domestic tax \nrevenues through the use of offshore financial centers. The problem is particularly acute in Asia. \nDeveloping countries lost $5.6 trillion in illicit financial outflows in 2001\u20142010; Asia accounted \nfor 61% of the total illicit outflows, which are illegally transferred and accumulated outside of the \ntaxpayers\u2019 countries of residence.3 The G20 Leaders\u2019 Declaration (issued 6 September 2013 \nduring  the  Saint  Petersburg  Summit)  stated  that  \u201cL  in  many  countries  ensuring  that  all \ntaxpayers pay their fair share of taxes is more than ever a priority. Tax avoidance, harmful \npractices, and aggressive tax planning have to be tackled.\u201d4 In order to counter international tax \nevasion schemes and the erosion of domestic tax revenues, tax authorities are increasingly \nseeking to strengthen their international network and capacity to obtain relevant information \nfrom taxpayers including that held in financial institutions, and to exchange information with \nforeign tax authorities.5 \n \n3.  SGATAR\u2019s members  comprise the  tax  authorities  in  16  countries  in  Asia  and  the \nPacific.6 ADB attends the annual meetings as an observer member and has expressed its \nwillingness to assist ADB DMCs according to specific demand.7  At SGATAR\u2019s annual meetings, \n                                                \n1 Tax evasion is a criminal attempt to avoid paying tax owed, and tax avoidance is an attempt to use the law including \nthe exploitation of its loopholes to reduce taxes owed. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 24 June 2013.  \n3  D. Kar and S. Freitas. 2012. Illicit Financial Flows from Developing Countries: 2001\u20132010. Washington, DC: Global \nFinancial Integrity.  \n4  Russia G20 Leaders\u2019 Declaration, p. 12.    \n    https://www.g20.org/sites/default/files/g20_resources/library/Saint_Petersburg_Declaration_ENG.pdf \n5  Tax treaties that prevent double taxation between two countries normally have a provision addressing information \nexchange (Article 26, Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital, OECD Committee on Fiscal Affairs).   \n6  SGATAR was initiated at the 5th Southeast Asian Ministerial Conference for Economic Development in Yogyakarta \nin 1970 as a study group for review and exchange of information on tax structures in Southeast Asia. The first \nSGATAR meeting was held in Manila in 1971; members comprise Australia; the People\u2019s Republic of China; Hong \nKong, China; Indonesia; Japan; the Republic of Korea; Macau, China; Malaysia; Mongolia; New Zealand; Papua \nNew Guinea; the Philippines; Singapore; Taipei,China; Thailand; and Viet Nam. \n7  From 1991 to 2011, ADB and the ADB Institute provided an annual tax conference program for DMCs as regional \ncapacity development TA projects; these mainly focused on double tax treaty and international taxation issues.    \n ", "2  \nmembers expressed the need to enhance the exchange of information to counter international \ntax avoidance, and increase the capacity of member tax authorities. Most recently, countering \ninternational tax avoidance and the exchange of information was one of the three working group \nthemes at the 43rd SGATAR annual meeting in October 2013 in Jeju, Republic of Korea, and its \ncommuniqu\u00e9 reaffirmed that encouraging the exchange of information to tackle offshore tax \nevasion was a common challenge for tax administration bodies in Asia.8  \n  \n4.  Further, it was recognized that tax authorities in DMCs, including SGATAR member \nauthorities,  face  common  difficulties.  First,  legal  frameworks,  internal  procedures,  and \norganizational  arrangements  remain  underdeveloped.  Second,  tax  officials  charged  with \nexchanging information with the country headquarters of foreign tax authorities have limited \npractical experience. In particular, while some DMC tax authorities have handled information \nexchange requests from developed countries, most lack experience sending such requests to \nforeign tax authorities for the purpose of investigating tax evasion in their own countries. Third, \nfront-line auditors have limited understanding of cross-border tax evasion schemes, and equally \nlimited capacity to obtain information requested by foreign tax authorities. Finally, there is \ninsufficient  mutual  understanding  of  the  legal  and  administrative  systems  and  capacity  of \npartner countries, which is critical for carrying out a smooth exchange of information.    \n \n5.  The  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development\u2019s  (OECD)  Global \nForum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes is promoting legal and \nregulatory frameworks on the exchange of information among tax authorities.9 While the OECD \nGlobal Forum recognizes the need for capacity development of tax authorities in Asia, it has \nlimited resources for capacity development activities in the region. The forum welcomes ADB \ntake a leading role in capacity development activities for tax authorities in Asia. \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The  TA  impact  will  be  a  sustainable  tax  base  in  participating  DMCs  through \nstrengthened  international  cooperation  on  tax  matters.  The  outcome  will  be  enhanced \nenforcement capacity in the member tax authorities of SGATAR.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n7.  The TA will strengthen the capacity of tax authorities in the eight ADB DMCs that are \nmembers of SGATAR\u2014i.e., the People\u2019s Republic of China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mongolia, \nPapua New Guinea, the Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam\u2014for the exchange of information \nfor tax purposes and audit on cross-border tax evasion. For the effective and sustainable \ncapacity development of tax authorities, the focus will be on developing training modules, and \ndelivering training courses targeting tax officials (i) in charge of exchanging information with \nforeign tax authorities at their country headquarters, and (ii) in charge of investigating cross-\nborder tax evasion cases at audit and investigation departments.  \n         \n8.  The TA has three main outputs. \n \n                                                \n8  SGATAR Communiqu\u00e9. 17 October 2013. Jeju, Republic of Korea.  \n9  The OECD Global Forum\u2019s work is supported by the G-20 process (G20 Leaders\u2019 Declaration. Saint Petersburg   \nSummit. 6 September 2013).  \n ", "  3\n(i)  Technical consultation session on international standards on the exchange \nof information for tax purposes delivered. A technical consultation will target \ntax  policy  and  administration  officials  of  four  DMC  members  of  SGATAR \n(Mongolia,  Papua  New  Guinea, Thailand,  and  Viet  Nam).10 The  consultation \nsession  will  analyze  the  current  legal  and  administrative  frameworks  and \npractices  with  respect  to  the  exchange  of  information for  tax  purposes,  and \nidentify issues to be addressed by the participant tax authorities.  \n \n(ii)  Recommendations  for  strengthening  international  cooperation  and \nexchange of information for tax purposes produced. The recommendations \nwill be proposed through a recommendation report, which will cover eight DMC \nmembers of SGATAR, and will identify and analyze areas that require further \ncapacity development with respect to exchange of information for tax purposes in \nregional and country-level contexts.  \n \n(iii)  Training courses for tax officials on the exchange of information and cross-\nborder tax evasion designed and delivered. The training courses will be based \non the capacity development needs assessment conducted by outputs (i) and (ii). \nThe training courses will target tax administration officials of eight DMC members \nof  SGATAR.  Possible  topics  for  the  training  courses  include  procedures  for \nexchanging  information,  and  bank  information  and  cross-border  tax  evasion \naudits.  \n  \n9.  The  TA  assumes  that  participant  tax  authorities  are  committed  to  developing  their \ncapacity for exchanging information and enhancing international cooperation. The main risk is \nthat capacity development activities do not immediately result in an increase in the number of \nexchange-of-information cases, because of a lack of institutional commitment to understanding \nthe need for international cooperation. To mitigate this risk, training sessions will target not only \nofficials in charge of international cooperation at country headquarters, but also front-line tax \nauditors in charge of investigating cross-border tax avoidance and evasion.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n10.  The TA is estimated to cost $820,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n11.  The Regional and Sustainable Development Department, ADB will be the executing \nagency for the TA. The TA will also coordinate with other ADB grant and TA projects on the \ncapacity development of tax authorities being implemented by regional departments and the \nEconomics and Research Department.11   \n \n                                                \n10 ADB\u2019s preliminary review has found that these four DMCs\u2019 legal and administrative frameworks require further \nimprovement. In addition, the DMCs are not members of OECD\u2019s Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of \nInformation for Tax Purposes.  \n11 For example, ADB. 2013. Technical Assistance to the Republic of the Philippines for Supporting Capacity \nDevelopment for the Bureau of Internal Revenue. Manila (TA 8354-PHI); ADB. 2013. Technical Assistance to the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China for Public Finance Development Strategy 2020. Manila (TA 8379-PRC); and ADB. \n2013. Technical Assistance for Tax Policy and Administration Research and Capacity Development. Manila (TA \n8450-REG).   \n ", "4  \n12.  The TA will be implemented in partnership with external partner organizations that have \nexpertise and practical experiences in the exchange of information for tax purposes in both \nglobal and regional contexts. The OECD Centre for Tax Policy and Administration is promoting \ninternational standards on transparency and exchange of information for tax purposes, and the \nNational Tax Agency, Japan, is leading regional good practices on international cooperation \namong  tax  authorities.  These  two  entities  are  expected  to  provide  resource  persons  for \ntechnical consultation sessions and training courses.   \n \n13.  The TA requires seven experts (two international consultants with 14 person-months of \ninputs and five national consultants with 20 person-months of inputs). The two international \nconsultants will produce a recommendation report and lead capacity development activities; the \nfive national consultants will assist the international consultants with country-specific expertise, \nand  provide  support  to  capacity  development  activities.  As  assignments  are  specific  and \nnarrowly defined, individual consultants are most appropriate. Consultants will be engaged by \nADB on an individual basis in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, \nas amended from time to time). Disbursement under the TA will be made in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). No \nTA  activities  will  be financed  or  undertaken  in  the territory  of  a  DMC  until  a  no-objection \nconfirmation has been obtained from the government of the DMC concerned.  \n \n14.  The Tax Policy and Administration Specialist will regularly report progress to ADB. A \nrecommendation  report  will  be  widely  disseminated  among  DMCs  and  international \norganizations as well as within ADB. The TA will be implemented from 1 May 2014 and will be \ncompleted by 31 March 2016.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n15.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $820,000 to be financed on a \ngrant  basis  by  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  for  Enhancing  Transparency  and \nExchange of Information for Tax Purposes, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n  \n \n \n ", "Appendix 1  5 \n1: DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets \nand Indicators with  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nA sustainable tax base  The ratio of tax revenue  Asian Development  Tax authorities \nin participating DMCs  to GDP increases by 3%  Bank\u2019s Key Indicators for  committed to tackling \nthrough strengthened  in participant DMCs by  Asia and the Pacific  aggressive tax \ninternational cooperation  2020 (baseline: 2012  avoidance schemes \non tax matters   average 18.8%)   through international \n  cooperation  \n   \n \nOutcome      Assumption \nEnhanced enforcement  New exchange-of- Follow-up assessment by  Tax authorities \ncapacity in the member  information and audit  the TA team  actively employ an \ntax authorities of  regime, based on TA    exchange-of-\nSGATAR  recommendations and  Country reports at  information \n  training courses,  SGATAR\u2019s annual  mechanism to tackle \nadopted in at least two  meetings  aggressive tax \nDMCs by 2016    avoidance schemes  \n(baseline: zero)   \n  Risk \nEnhanced capacity \ndoes not directly lead \nto an increase in the \nnumber of exchange-\nof-information cases \n \nOutputs       Assumption \n      Tax authorities willing \n1.
