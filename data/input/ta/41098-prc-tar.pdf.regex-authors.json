INTRODUCTION \n1  During the Country Programming Mission in November 2006, the Government of the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  to  develop  the  capacity  of  executing  agencies  (EAs)  and \nimplementing  agencies  (IAs)  of  ADB-financed  projects.  ADB  recognizes  the  importance  of \ncapacity development for improving portfolio performance and, more importantly, for creating a \nmore conducive environment for value additions to PRC\u2019s public sector development. The focus \nis to supplement the current efforts for improving portfolio performance and promoting results-\noriented project management by facilitating knowledge transfer, showcasing good practices, \nand scaling up lessons learned. Inclusion of the TA in the 2007 pipeline with an increased \nfunding amount was confirmed during the Country Program Midterm Review Mission in April \n2007.  \n \n2  Fact-finding discussions for the TA were conducted during late June and early July 2007. \nThe Ministry of Finance (MOF), EA for the TA, has agreed on the impact, outcome, outputs and \nscope, cost, financing and implementation arrangements, and terms of reference. 1  The TA \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3  As of 31 December 2006, ADB\u2019s total loan commitment to the PRC since the start of its \noperations in 1986 stood at $17.8 billion for 125 public sector loans. Of that number, 78 are \nclosed and 47 in the amount of $8.26 billion are ongoing. The PRC portfolio is one of ADB\u2019s \nlargest portfolios. The size of the portfolio is expected to remain at about the same level, but the \nnumber of projects will increase in the future. Overall, the PRC portfolio has been performing \nwell,  but  there  are  some  shortcomings  such  as  delays  in  loan  start-up  activities,  project \nimplementation,  and  disbursement  processing.  Streamlining  the  project  implementation \nprocedures and training EA/IA staff are critical for better portfolio performance. Earlier country \nportfolio review missions found that delays in project implementation are largely caused by lack \nof familiarity with ADB requirements and guidelines. The ability to implement projects efficiently \nand economically depends on the knowledge, skills, and experience of EA and IA staff. \n \n4  In response to PRC\u2019s 11th Five-Year Social and Economic Development Plan, ADB, in \nconsultation with the Government, is formulating a new Country Partnership Strategy for the \nPRC that is expected to focus more on assisting agriculture and rural development, social \nsectors, and environmental management.2 Such a change in ADB strategy and programs will \ncreate challenges for project design and implementation\u2015complex projects spanning multiple \nsectors and/or subsectors, location of project sites in remote parts of the middle and western \nregions of the PRC, and multiagency coordination. These challenges, coupled with inadequate \nstaff capacity in many of the new EAs and local IAs in small cities or counties, can impede the \nsmooth implementation of projects.  \n \n5  Project design and implementation are becoming more and more complex, but EAs/IAs \nare not necessarily prepared to face the challenge. EAs/IAs lack institutional capacity and \nexperience  in  planning,  managing,  and  implementing  projects  funded  by  international \norganizations. They also tend to be weak in establishing good financial management systems, \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 26 April 2007.  \n2  The 2007\u20132009 lending pipeline shows this trend. Of the 37 projects in the pipeline, 12 will be in agriculture and \nnatural resources and 9 in social infrastructure.  \n ", "2   \ncorporate  governance,  and  accountability  mechanisms.  The  weak  capacity  and  limited \nexperience often result in inefficient project implementation and could adversely affect project \noutcomes and impacts. \n \n6  Capacity  development  is  one  of  ADB\u2019s  thematic  priorities,  aimed  at  enhancing  the \neffectiveness, efficiency, and sustainability of ADB interventions. Strengthened country capacity \ncontributes to achieve better public sector performance. Capacity development is particularly \nimportant as ADB-financed projects are increasingly moving to the poorer middle and western \nprovinces where problems of weak financial management, institutional capacity, and corporate \ngovernance are more acute. \n \n7  As new lending modalities evolve, ADB will also need to help develop the EAs and IAs \nexperience and capability in carrying out innovative projects such as sector loan or multitranche \nfinancing facility (MFF) projects. Strong project management capacity at the provincial to county \nlevels is essential for successful implementation, and an innovative model to scale up project \npreparation and implementation will be needed where projects involve a large number of smaller \ncities and counties, and multiple subprojects. \n \n8  ADB, in collaboration with MOF, has in the past been conducting annual seminars on \nprocurement, consulting services, and disbursement. However, these annual training programs \nare normally conducted at the national level and can accommodate only a limited number of \nparticipants from EAs and/or IAs. The needs of EAs and IAs cannot be met in a timely and \nadequate manner under the existing training programs. The ADB Resident Mission in the PRC \n(PRCM) started training on procurement and disbursement for selected individual EAs and IAs \nin early 2006. Such training has been appreciated by the Government, EAs, and IAs. However, \nthe coverage is limited due to shortages of staff and financial resources and heavy work loads in \nPRCM. The TA will supplement current efforts to strengthen institutional capacities of EAs and \nIAs  for  better  project  management  by  delivering  training  programs  to  EAs/IAs,  facilitating \nknowledge transfer, showcasing good practices, and scaling up lessons learned. \n \n9  First, to strengthen institutional capacity, it is important to properly define the roles and  \nresponsibilities of government entities, particularly provincial governments, EAs, IAs, and other \nproject  stakeholders  throughout  the  project  cycle  (comprising  project  identification, \nformulation/design, approval, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation), including those \nconcerned  with  safeguard  policies,  thematic  priorities,  and  sector  policies.  In  addition,  the \nGovernment\u2019s approval procedures for project development as well as administrative framework \nfor project implementation and ADB\u2019s project cycles need to be adequately aligned. \n \n10  Second, there is an urgent need to systematically train EAs and IAs so as to strengthen \ntheir capacity to design, manage, implement, monitor, and operate ADB-financed projects. \nMoreover, there has been increasing emphasis on value addition beyond investments and on \nfunding  agencies\u2019  developing  a  good  understanding  of  country  capacities  and  change \nmanagement processes. \n \n11  Third,  there  is  the  need  to  identify  project  success  stories  and  to  showcase  best \nexamples of value additions to promote transfer, dissemination, and take-up of knowledge, \ntechnology, best practices, and reform initiatives for possible replication/spillover influences in \nother provinces/entities.  \n \n12  The showcasing of project success stories by concerned EAs and IAs (including media \nexposure) will enable other EAs and IAs and provinces to learn from the acquired experiences \n ", "  3\nand  best  practices. 3   MOF,  the  provinces  concerned,  and  ADB  will  jointly  facilitate  such \ndissemination by selectively organizing interprovince/interagency workshops or seminars. While \nthe participating EAs and IAs and provinces will benefit in terms of dissemination and spillover \ninfluences  of  value-added  products,  the  host  EA/province  will  indirectly  benefit  from  the \nrecognition  of  their  efforts  for  successfully  implementing  value-added  products.  Such \nshowcasing may motivate EAs and IAs to place more emphasis on efficient implementation of \nthe projects. As for ADB, showcasing would bring its contribution to the surface and enable it to \nmainstream  its  focus  and  priorities  for  renewed  value  addition  through  the  formulation  of \nresponsive strategies. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n13  The impact of the TA will be improved portfolio performance of ADB-financed projects in \nthe  PRC  and  optimized  recycling  of  ADB  projects\u2019  value  additions  to  PRC\u2019s public sector \ndevelopment. The outcome of the TA will be strengthened capacity of EAs and IAs to plan, \ndesign, implement, manage, monitor, and operate ADB-financed projects. The TA will help \nstreamline project implementation procedures and disseminate, selectively transfer, share, and \ntake  up  knowledge,  technology,  best  practices  and/or  reform  initiatives  achieved  through \nsuccessful implementation of ADB-financed projects.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14  To support achievement of the outcome and contribute to the longer-term impact, the \nTA\u2019s  key  outputs  will  be  (i)  clear  identification  of  well-defined  functions,  roles,  and \nresponsibilities  of  all  stakeholders,  particularly  of  EAs  and  IAs,  in  the  project  cycle;  (ii) \ndevelopment of training programs and training materials, and the holding of training workshops \nin project design, planning, implementation, and management; (iii) workshops for selectively \nshowcasing best examples of  transfer, dissemination, and take-up of knowledge, technology, \nbest practices, and reform initiatives  achieved through successful implementation of ADB-\nfinanced projects; and (iv) development of training programs for trainers and establishment of a \npool of trainers.  \n \n15  The main activities under the first output will include (i) reviewing the implementation \narrangements  of  ADB-financed  projects  in  the  PRC,  (ii)  assessing  the  effectiveness  and \nefficiency of those implementation arrangements, (iii) identifying major constraints and issues \nthat impede smooth project implementation, and (iv) proposing options to mitigate constraints \nand streamline proper implementation arrangements for typical projects in each sector where \nADB is currently involved.  \n \n16  The second output of the TA will include capacity development through targeted training \nand will initially focus on three tiers of the project cycle: (i) support for project design and \nplanning, including training during implementation of the project preparatory TA; (ii) pre-project \nimplementation training focusing on jump-starting project implementation and on safeguard \nawareness; and (iii) project implementation and monitoring training introducing better project \n                                                 \n3  The first Showcase Workshop to disseminate value additions through the implementation of Loan 1985-PRC: \nHebei Wastewater Management Project was organized in June 2007 on an interprovincial partnership approach \nthat involved one province showcasing its knowledge and experiences in institutional reforms and wastewater tariff \nrestructuring for the benefit of other provinces.  The workshop was much appreciated because it was practical and \ndirectly relevant to wastewater management. \n ", "4   \nmanagement  practices.  Training  under  the  TA  will  cover  project  planning  and  design, \nprocurement,  consulting  services,  disbursements,  social  and  environmental  safeguards, \nperformance  monitoring,  financial  management,  project  management,  and  anticorruption. \nTargeted participants may include directors, managers, and key project management staff of \nEAs  and  IAs,  as  well as  officials from  line  ministries,  provincial  finance  departments,  and \nprovincial national development and reform commissions. Key activities will be (i) assessing the \ntraining needs of EAs and IAs; (ii) developing a set of generic and sector-specific training \nmaterials in both English and Chinese, in the form of handbooks and compact discs; and (iii) \ndelivering training to EAs and IAs at national and regional levels, as well as to individual EA \nand/or IA, and revising the training materials considering feedback. The training materials will be \nuploaded on the ADB website. During TA implementation, priorities will be given to EAs and IAs \nof complex and multicomponent projects in agriculture and natural resources, environment, and \nsocial infrastructure sectors. A pilot capacity development and training program will be offered \nfor the EA and IAs of the proposed Ningxia Integrated Ecosystem and Agricultural Development \nProject4 (the loan project) since they will be implementing an ADB-financed project for the first \ntime, their capacities are relatively weak, and the loan project is complex in nature. The design \nof the pilot program will be tailored to fit their needs, in coordination with other interventions for \ncapacity development under the global environment facility (GEF) and the loan project.  \n \n17  Under the third output, the key activities will include (i) identifying ADB-financed projects \nwith good performance, (ii) summarizing their successful stories and best practices, and (iii) \nconducting workshops to disseminate those best practices and their possible replication in other \nADB-financed projects or other provinces. \n \n18  Under the fourth output, the key activities will include (i) selecting experienced staff from \nEAs, IAs, and other agencies (including consulting firms and procurement agents) as candidate \ntrainers; (ii) training them, emphasizing methodologies for needs assessment and targeted \ntraining; and (iii) establishing a pool of trainers. The training workshops will be conducted at the \nnational level, regional level, or sector-wide, and in individual EAs and IAs. A mix of multiple \napproaches tailored to meet operational needs will be explored during TA implementation. \n \n19  The expected results and deliverables include (i) a report on streamlining the project \nimplementation  procedures  including  well-defined  functions,  roles,  and  responsibilities  of \ndifferent government entities, and alignment of the Government\u2019s approval procedures and \nADB\u2019s project cycles; (ii) a report on capacity assessment and training needs; (iii) a set of \ntraining materials in Chinese and English, including case studies; (iv) five nationwide or region-\nwide or sector-wide training workshops and a number of tailor-made training workshops for \nindividual EAs and IAs or a group of EAs and IAs; (v) three workshops showcasing successful \nvalue addition by the projects; and (vi) a pool of about 20 trainers. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n20  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $950,000 equivalent, of which ADB will provide \n$750,000 on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government will contribute \n$200,000 equivalent in kind for office space, counterpart staff, local transport, workshops, and \nother miscellaneous services. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \n                                                 \n4  This project is expected to be approved in October 2007. \n ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n21  The International Department of MOF will be the EA for the TA. The Director of Division \nIII of the International Department will serve as TA task manager of the EA, responsible for \nroutine administration and coordination of the TA. A joint task force (JTF) will be set up to \nprovide overall guidance and supervise implementation of the TA. The JTF will comprise the \ndirectors of Division III and TA Division of the International Department (including the TA task \nmanager), a director concerned in the National Development and Reform Commission, the head \nof the Portfolio Management Unit in PRCM, and the project team leader of the TA. Sector \ndivisions in  the  East Asia  Department  (EARD)  and  departments/offices concerned  in  ADB \nheadquarters will be consulted during design and implementation of the TA. A TA and workshop \ncoordinator (consultant) will be recruited to support TA implementation, and will be mainly \nresponsible for daily coordination of various TA activities, preparation of quarterly TA progress \nreports, and liaison with the EA and ADB. \n \n22  The TA will be implemented over a period of about 26 months from October 2007 to \nDecember 2009. The following national experts (person-months are in parentheses) will provide \na total of 46 person-months of consulting services: (i) TA and workshop coordinator (24), (ii) \ninstitutional  and  capacity  development  expert  (4),  (iii)  project  management  expert  (3),  (iv) \nprocurement and consulting services expert (2.5), (v) disbursement expert (1.5), (vi) social \ndevelopment expert (2), (vii) resettlement expert (3), (viii) environment expert (3), and (ix) audit \nand financial management expert (3). The outline terms of reference (TOR) for the consulting \nservices  are  in  Appendix  3.  The  required  expertise  and  the  detailed  TOR  for  specific \nassignments, including duration and expected results, will be endorsed by the JTF. Additional \ninternational and national resource persons and short-term task-specific experts will also be \nrecruited to carry out well-defined tasks (e.g., case study papers, workshop presentations, \nparticipation in workshops, review of draft reports, etc.). \n \n23  ADB, in consultation with the EA, will select and engage consultants in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The \nconsultants  will  be  recruited  on  an  individual  basis  since  varied  expertise  on  short-term \nengagement will be required, the main requirements of the assignments are for individual \nqualifications and experience, and the assignments are more on individual basis with no need \nfor extra support from the consultant\u2019s home office. It may also be difficult for a firm to provide \nmultidisciplinary expertise over an implementation period of more than 2 years as required by \nthe TA. Team coordination and leadership work will be undertaken by the TA and workshop \ncoordinator. To facilitate the preparation and implementation of the training and showcasing \nworkshops, ADB may establish an advance payment facility as needed and/or utilize direct \npayment to workshop sponsors and workshop venues.  \n \nIV.
