The Board of Directors of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved the work program of \nthe Independent Evaluation Department (IED) for 2013\u22122015, with effect from 7 December 2012.1 \nIED\u2019s yearly program devotes more effort to higher-level evaluations covering multiple countries, \nsectors, and themes to complement project evaluations.2 These evaluations also emphasize a more \nstrategic perspective to ensure that ADB\u2019s directions and operations are captured and supported by \nmore intense knowledge and outreach activities to maximize usefulness and impact. This research \nand development technical assistance (TA) for Selected Evaluation Studies for 2013 will cover a time \nslice of the 2013\u22122015 program cycle, with a focus on the studies initiated in 2013.3 It will fund select \nevaluations  supporting  both  ADB  operational  programs  (i.e.,  country  evaluations  and  sector \nassessments)  and  knowledge  programs  (i.e.,  thematic  and  corporate  evaluations,  impact \nevaluations, and topical working papers). The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Strategy 2020and its results framework put increased emphasis on accountability and results \n \nby defining clear objectives and putting a mechanism in place to monitor progress.4 This TA will help \nIED supply evaluative feedback on the effectiveness of ADB operations in order to gauge the \ncontinued relevance and effectiveness of Strategy 2020 in several important thematic areas, and in \none country, Tajikistan. \n \n3.  Strengthening  regional  cooperation  and  integration.  The  Regional  Cooperation  and \nIntegration (RCI) Strategy adopted in 2006 set forth an explicit and integrated development approach \nto RCI.5 It identifies ADB\u2019s priorities, elaborates on its role in supporting and promoting RCI, and \ndelineates organizational responsibilities for implementation. Strategy 2020 reaffirmed the overall \nstrategic directions outlined in the RCI strategy and set a long-term target of increasing RCI-related \nlending to at least 30% of ADB operations by 2020. A proposed thematic evaluation study will assess \nthe design and implementation of the RCI strategy to provide broad guidance for future ADB regional \noperations. It will try to address the following questions: In what ways and how effectively did ADB \nintegrate RCI into its operations in terms of the modalities used in different regional, subregional, and \ncountry  contexts?  To  what  extent  have  ADB\u2019s  RCI  projects  achieved  their  intended  outputs, \noutcomes,  and  impacts?  How  has  ADB  coordinated  with  other  agencies  involved  in  RCI  and \nmonitored the progress of such activities? Is ADB on track to achieve the Strategy 2020 RCI lending \ntarget? How can the RCI strategy be strengthened to enhance development effectiveness, in line \nwith Strategy 2020?  \n \n4.  Implementing the safeguard policy. ADB\u2019s safeguard policy is embodied in its Safeguard \nPolicy Statement issued in July 2009.6 ADB\u2019s environmental and social safeguards are a cornerstone \nof its support for inclusive economic growth and environmental sustainability. The objectives of the \npolicy are to avoid or, when avoidance is not possible, to minimize or mitigate adverse project \n                                                \n1 The work program is driven by several main considerations: (i) providing timely input to the formulation of future \npolicies, strategies, and programs of ADB; (ii) providing real-time feedback during loan processing and implementation; \n(iii) undertaking evaluation capacity building of regional departments and developing member countries; and (iv) \ncontributing to knowledge solutions.  \n2 IED\u2019s major evaluations include thematic, corporate, real-time, and impact evaluation studies;  evaluation knowledge \nstudies; and country and regional evaluations. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 1 February 2013. \n4 ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. Manila. \nhttp://www.adb.org/documents/strategy-2020-working-asia-and-pacific-free-poverty \n5 Its four pillars include separate but interrelated activities: (i) cross-border infrastructure and related software; (ii) trade \nand  investment  cooperation  and  integration;  (iii)  monetary  and  financial  cooperation  and  integration;  and  (iv) \ncooperation in regional public goods, i.e., prevention of communicable diseases and environmental degradation. \n6  ADB.  2009.  Policy  Paper:  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  Manila.  http://www.adb.org/documents/safeguard-policy-\nstatement \n ", "2 \n \nimpacts on the environment and affected people, and to help borrowers strengthen safeguard \nsystems and develop a capacity to manage environmental and social risks. The policy also stipulates \nthat IED conduct two reviews. The first, after 3 years, will be an operational review to assess \nprogress on the use and effectiveness of country safeguards systems, and implementation and \neffectiveness of safeguard requirements for financial intermediation projects. The second review, \nafter  5  years,  will  assess  the  effectiveness  of  the  2009  policy  in  achieving  ADB's  safeguard \nobjectives. During the Asian Development Fund XI replenishment negotiations, donors requested \nIED to report on ADB\u2019s safeguards implementation during the fund\u2019s midterm review in October \n2014. In light of this, the evaluation will proceed in two phases: an operational review due around \nend-2013, and a thematic evaluation on the effectiveness of the 2009 policy due by mid-2014.  \n \n5.  Evaluating the role of technical assistance operations. TA operations can be financed by \ngrants or, more rarely, loans through ADB\u2019s main fund sources or a number of special funds provided \nby individual donors. ADB TA operations are important as these facilitate capacity development, \nknowledge building, and project preparation in developing member countries (DMCs). TA resources \nare also used to address global issues (such as regional cooperation or climate change). As such, \nTA operations in ADB and other international financial institutions are increasing in importance, \ncomplementing  the  traditional  loan  portfolios.  Many  institutions  are  interested  in  improving  the \nstrategic relevance, efficiency, and effectiveness of this instrument. In this context, the Development \nEffectiveness Committee requested that IED review the role of TA in ADB and assess how it can \nbest contribute to strengthening the development effectiveness of ADB operations. \n \n6.  Education  impact  evaluation.  IED  will  conduct  an  impact  evaluation  on  the  learning \noutcomes of school facilities improvement, teacher training, and stipends for female secondary \nschool students. Its findings will seek to provide direction for future investments in strengthening \nsecondary education in Bangladesh, by identifying what works and what does not. This will enable \nthe government to plan appropriate interventions, and assist ADB staff to design better projects, \ntaking into account learning outcomes. The study may evaluate differential impacts from project \ninterventions by assessing the performance of schools, teachers, and students in project areas that \ndid not receive such treatment (i.e., counterfactuals). Its focus will be on teachers and students from \ngrades  6\u201310,  assessing  learning  outcomes  in  mathematics,  science,  computer  literacy,  and  a \nlanguage (Bangla or English), depending on the school\u2019s medium of instruction. Data permitting, the \nevaluation may also assess differences in learning outcomes across project schools (i.e., public and \nprivate schools, rural and urban schools).  \n \n7.  Country assistance program evaluation: Tajikistan. The proposed country assistance \nprogram evaluation (CAPE) for Tajikistan will be the first assessment of ADB country strategies and \nprograms in Tajikistan. It aims to draw lessons and make recommendations for the next country \npartnership strategy (CPS), and provide an objective assessment and rating of the performance of \nADB\u2019s assistance to Tajikistan\u2014and identify factors affecting such performance.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The impact of the TA will be improved development effectiveness of ADB operations, policies, \nstrategies,  and  business  processes.  Its  expected  outcome  will  be  increased  use  of  evaluation \nfindings,  lessons,  and  recommendations  by  the  ADB  Board  of  Directors  and  the  Board\u2019s \nDevelopment Effectiveness Committee, by ADB Management and operations, and also by the public. \n \n ", "3 \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n9.  An  evaluation  approach  paper  (EAP)  detailing  the  rationale,  objective  and  scope, \nmethodologies  to  be  used,  resource  requirements,  terms  of  reference  for  consultants,  and \ndissemination plan will be prepared for each major evaluation under this TA before a study begins. A \nconcept paper may be prepared in cases where diagnostic work is needed prior to finalizing the EAP, \nor where a country sector assessment is more conveniently conducted ahead of the CAPE into \nwhich it will ultimately feed. Consultant recruitment may begin when either a draft EAP or a concept \npaper is signed off by IED\u2019s director general for interdepartmental review.7 All major IED evaluations \nare intended to provide inputs for milestone reviews and decisions by ADB\u2019s Board and Management \nand the IED will schedule the studies to meet the relevant deadlines. Once completed, major \nevaluation reports are circulated to the Board and Management and normally discussed by the \nDevelopment Effectiveness Committee.  \n \n10.  Country  assistance  program  evaluations,  sector  assessments,  and  validations  of \ncountry partnership strategy final reviews. IED undertakes evaluation studies in direct response \nto  ADB  country  operations  (i.e., IED\u2019s  derived  program). These  comprise  preparing  CAPEs  or \nvalidating CPS final reviews for select DMCs, provided the date of the CPS into which these are to \nfeed is announced to IED in sufficient time.8 The TA will finance at least one CAPE (Tajikistan) and \nvalidate several CPS final reviews (e.g., Bhutan, Cambodia, and Regional Southeast Asia). The \nCAPE will evaluate ADB support to the country and cover ADB strategy, policy dialogue, completed \nand ongoing projects and TA, and ADB performance. It will provide ADB and the DMC with a basis \nfor determining the future CPS. When appropriate, country sector assessments will provide inputs \nduring the preparation of a CAPE. Each sector assessment will evaluate ADB performance within a \ngiven sector in the country, focusing again on strategy, policy dialogue, ongoing and completed \nprojects and TA, and performance. \n \n11.  Regional Cooperation and Integration Strategy and related operations. The thematic \nevaluation study will review the design and implementation of ADB\u2019s RCI strategy, from its inception \nin 2006 up to the end of 2013. The study will assess the responsiveness, results, and relevance of \nthe RCI strategy and RCI-related elements of Strategy 2020, to draw out useful lessons for future \noperations. The study will initially undertake a desk review of project documents, evaluation reports, \nand pertinent literature. It will also take stock of previous regional evaluations to learn from best \npractices of development partners in RCI-related work. The achievements will also be assessed in \nrelation to the RCI strategy\u2019s results framework and the RCI-specific strategic priorities of Strategy \n2020. This will include validation of the findings of the ongoing ADB self-assessment of its RCI \nstrategy (being undertaken by the Office of Regional Economic Integration). The study will assess \nADB\u2019s regional operations in terms of their effectiveness in delivering envisaged outputs, outcomes, \nand  impacts.  The  evaluation  will  involve  an  in-depth  review  of  activities  (e.g.,  projects,  policy \ndialogue, and other forms of cooperation) across the four RCI pillars in the five regions. Perception \nsurveys and key informant interviews of regional DMC stakeholders and other development partners \nundertaking RCI-related work will also be conducted to elicit views about ADB\u2019s RCI achievements.  \n \n                                                \n7  IED considers consultant recruitment appropriate also in cases when: (i) concept papers are approved or circulated \ninterdepartmentally for sector or thematic assessments to be done prior to, but in the context of, CAPEs; and (ii) \nconcept papers are approved or circulated interdepartmentally to hire consultants for diagnostic work or background \npapers in the context of other evaluations.  \n8  A CAPE is conducted before preparing a CPS, but not all CPSs are preceded by CAPEs. If the work program of IED \ndoes not include a CAPE for a country that is due for a new CPS, IED will validate a CPS final review. The CPS final \nreview validation report then serves as the equivalent of a CAPE for the purpose of CPS preparation. ", "4 \n \n12.  Implementation of the safeguard policy. The thematic evaluation study will assess ADB \nsafeguard operations since the adoption of the Safeguard Policy Statement in 2009.9 The focus will \nbe on DMC implementation of safeguards, ADB\u2019s supervision and support, its outcomes on the \nground, gaps in compliance, and gaps in equivalence between ADB\u2019s safeguards and the country\u2019s \npolicies and organizational practices. The study will also give special attention to ADB TA projects \nthat are implemented to address compliance and equivalence issues, and to develop capacity in this \nfield. It will look into the staffing and resources of ADB to manage safeguards in its projects. The \nstudy will include a review of the portfolio to discern trends in the application of the policy by region, \nincome level, sector, and time. In-depth reviews of selected projects will also be carried out on the \nground, possibly in five DMCs\u2014in Southeast Asia, South Asia, Central and West Asia, East Asia, \nand  the  Pacific\u2014to  draw  out  key  lessons.  ADB  documents  such  as  environmental  impact \nassessments, environmental management plans, resettlement plans and frameworks, indigenous \npeoples plans and frameworks, and related documents will be examined. The evaluation will also \nlook at several types of DMC organizations that apply country safeguard systems, including financial \nintermediaries, and how these interact with ADB.  \n \n13.  Technical assistance approach and methodology. The evaluation study will assess the \nrole of TA by looking at policy and guidance documents, emerging trends in TA, and a review of ADB \nperformance.  The  study  will  (i)  review  and  assess  ADB\u2019s  guiding  policy  and  implementation \ndocuments for TA operations (i.e., the 2008 TA policy paper10 and 2011 Operations Manual11); (ii) \nreview  ADB\u2019s  business  processes  for  TA  approval  and  implementation  (including  the  use  of \nconsultants); (iii) compare ADB\u2019s TA practices with those of other international financial institutions \n(including independent evaluations related to TA); and (iv) assess the performance of ADB TA in its \nvarious forms (e.g., capacity development TA, policy and advisory TA, research and development \nTA, project preparatory TA). The evaluation will involve (i) desk review of key documents and a \nbenchmarking exercise, (ii) portfolio analyses and a review of self and independently evaluated TA \nprojects, (iii) key informant interviews, and (iv) a few country case studies.  \n \n14.  Impact evaluations. The TA will support at least two rigorous impact evaluations. The \nSecondary Education Sector Improvement Project (Loan 1690-BAN[SF]) in Bangladesh has been \nidentified as a potential candidate for such evaluation, and its suitability will be confirmed through a \nscoping mission in consultation with the executing agency.12 The evaluation will comprise four steps: \n(i) literature review, (ii) secondary data analysis and identification of counterfactuals, (iii) primary data \ncollection, and (iv) data analysis and report preparation. The study will build on data collected during \nthe project\u2019s implementation and identify relevant comparison groups (counterfactuals) based on \nsecondary data and key informant interviews. The impact evaluation will adopt a mixed method \napproach encompassing both qualitative and quantitative techniques, and will be guided by data \ncollected by the study team (i.e., a large survey of households and/or schools). For quantitative \nimpacts, an instrumental variable, propensity score matching, or regression discontinuity approach \nwill be adopted. The study will also take stock of the status of reform measures introduced under the \nADB-supported project.  \n15.  Other  sector  and  thematic  assessments,  and  topical  working  papers.  The  TA  will \nsupport  selected  country,  sector,  and/or  thematic  assessments  needed  to  feed  into  or  help \ndisseminate the high-level or major evaluations in the IED work program. This will also include \n                                                \n9 Timing of study preparation is in line with the Asian Development Fund donors\u2019 requirement for evaluation feedback \nduring the fund\u2019s midterm review. IED will carry out the study from the second half of 2013 through the first half of \n2014. \n10 ADB. 2008. Increasing the Impact of the Asian Development Bank\u2019s Technical Assistance Program.

Evaluation  outreach  and  knowledge  sharing.  To  make  its  evaluation  products  more \naccessible and influential, IED will continue to disclose, disseminate, and share evaluation feedback \non performance and lessons. It will support interactive knowledge-sharing events (i.e., conferences, \nseminars, workshops) on at least two completed major evaluations. These will be a venue for \nlearning and showcasing of evaluation products; informing stakeholders of formative, summative, \nand prospective evaluation approaches, and findings and lessons. The learning events are to be held \nin selected DMCs in partnership with national think tanks, evaluation societies, public and/or nonprofit \nresearch institutions, and other partners. From each learning event, IED will also seek to develop \ncommunication and outreach products (such as podcasts, multimedia products, and synopses), to \npromote further  learning.  IED  will  also  continue  to  prepare  and  publish  syntheses,  briefs,  and \noccasional papers tailored to widen readership, and use new mediums for knowledge sharing (e.g., \nonline readers, tablets) to extend the reach of its products.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,950,000. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix \n2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA. The IED will implement it and supervise all \nplanned studies. The studies will require the services of 34 international consultants for about 47 \nperson-months and 33 national consultants for about 68 person-months.13 The outline terms of \nreference for consulting requirements are in Appendix 3. More detailed terms of reference for each \nstudy will be developed for the EAP. ADB will engage consultants primarily on an individual basis in \naccordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The \nspecific  services  required  from  consulting  firms  (e.g.,  for  surveys)  will  be  considered  during \npreparation of the EAP. \n \n19.  Disbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). Tracking of study progress will be \nrecorded through internal monitoring sheets on key milestone events, mission back-to-office reports, \nand ad hoc presentations or consultations on evaluation study findings. The TA outputs will be \ndisseminated in accordance with IED\u2019s evaluation policy, particularly with regard to public disclosure, \ndissemination, and lessons. The TA is scheduled to start on 1 May 2013, and expected to end by 30 \nJune 2015. Implementation arrangements will be flexible to accommodate alterations in IED\u2019s work \nprogram or changes in response to priorities under Strategy 2020 and assistance provided from \nAsian Development Fund X and XI. ADB will obtain a no-objection from the DMC government before \nstarting any activity financed under this TA in the territory of that country. \n \nIV.  THE RANKING VICE-PRESIDENT\u2019S RECOMMENDATION \n20.  The Ranking Vice-President, acting in the absence of the President, under the provisions of \nArticle 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, recommends that the Board approve the provision of \ntechnical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $1,950,000  on  a  grant  basis  for  Selected \nEvaluation Studies for 2013.  \n                                                \n13 The number of consultants and their inputs remain tentative. Consultant requirements will be reviewed during \ndiscussions on the concept paper or evaluation approach paper.

Country assistance program evaluations, sector assessments, and validations of \ncountry partnership strategy final reviews (seven international consultants for a total of 13 \nperson-months  and  12  national  consultants  for  24  person-months).1  Country  assistance \nevaluations provide the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the developing member countries \n(DMCs) with a basis for determining the future country partnership strategy (CPS).2 Depending \non country and sector requirements, sector and/or thematic assessments are undertaken to \nprovide inputs to the main country assistance program evaluation (CAPE). Sector assessments \nwill evaluate ADB's strategy, policy dialogue, ongoing and completed projects and technical \nassistance (TA), and performance within a given sector in a country. Their preparation will \nrequire the services of sector and/or theme specialists (both international and national). \n \n2.  International consultants (total of 8 person-months for CAPEs and their associated \nsector assessments and 5 person-months for validations of CPS final reviews). The consultants \nare expected to (i) update reviews of ADB-financed assistance programs and assess their \nrelevance,  effectiveness,  efficiency,  sustainability,  and  their  impacts  on  strategic  sector \nobjectives; (ii) undertake key informant interviews and conduct stakeholder surveys on the \noutcome and impact of ADB assistance, and discuss sector development issues and concerns \nwith  executing  agencies  and  other  government  and  nongovernment  entities;  and  (iii)  help \nassess the validity of ADB\u2019s sector development strategies in the study country. \n \n3.  National  consultants  (total  of  12  person-months  for  five  headquarters-based \nconsultants  and  12  person-months  for  seven  in-country  experts).
