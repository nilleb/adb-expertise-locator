INTRODUCTION\n1. The rehabilitation of Viet Nam's critical fisheries infrastructure and the development\nof sustainable aquaculture were first identified as urgent needs by a Bank Fisheries Sector\nReview Mission1 in December 1992. Subsequently, a team of international consultants briefly\nreviewed the aquaculture subsector in 1993 under funding arrangements with the Canadian\nInternational Development Agency (CIDA), during a feasibility study for the Fisheries\nInfrastructure Improvement Project. Recent work has provided an overview of the main influences\non coastal and marine management and the fragile ecosystems in which much of Viet Nam's\ncoastal aquaculture development has taken place.2\n2. Concern about the rapid expansion of aquaculture, the resultant large-scale\ndegradation of coastal mangrove and Melaleuca forest areas, and a massive outbreak of shrimp\ndisease in 1993-1994 has led the Government to request the Bank for technical assistance (TA)\nin the development of sustainable coastal aquaculture.3 The TA was initially discussed by a loan\nFact-finding Mission for the Fisheries Infrastructure Improvement Project in April 1994. A Follow-\nup Mission visited Viet Nam from 13 to 17 February 1995, during which an understanding was\nreached with the Government on the objectives, scope, and terms of reference for the TA\nconsultants, estimated costs and financing plan, and implementation arrangements for the TA.\nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n3. Estimates of Viet Nam's annual sustainable catch for marine fish range from\n1 .2 million to 1 .4 million tons, and the country has about 1 .4 million hectares of total inland water\narea suitable for aquaculture development. Adding to this aquaculture potential are over 300,000\nha of tidal areas and hundreds of thousands of hectares of straits and bays suitable for\nmariculture.\n4. According to its development objectives, the Government intends to produce\n1 .6 million tons of fish by the year 2,000 by increasing the marine fish catch from 0.88 million\ntons (1994) to 1 million tons and aquaculture production from 0.33 tons (1994) to 0.60 million\ntons. This target is based on the remaining balance of marine fish and aquaculture resources\nand the past record of overall production growth, i.e., 22 percent for the marine catch and\n43 percent for aquaculture since 1986. The Government also aims to achieve a fishery export\nvalue of $1 billion, up from $458 million in 1994, and increase the 1993 per capita fish supply\nBased on the findings of a loint fisheries sector review mission from the Bank and the Food and Agriculture\nOrganization of the United Nations (FAO), which visited Viet Nam in December 1990.\nFor example, see case study material prepared under RETA 5552: Coastal and Marine Environmental\nManagement in the South China Sea - Workshop on Coastal and Marine Environmental Management\n(WCMEM) and Consultative Meeting (27-29 March 1995); and Results of a Survey on Shrimp Disease in Minh\nHai Province, Viet Nam (Faculty of Aquaculture, Can Tho University).\nThe TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in June 1994 as a Project Preparation TA. It was\nsubsequently decided that an assessment of the coastal aquaculture subsector and the development of\nstrategic priorities were required prior to the preparation of a future coastal aquaculture development project.\nThe advisory TA, as now proposed, will adopt a participatory approach to the subsector analysis as well as\nto the identification of potential areas for future detailed project preparation.\n-...\t I\t \u2022", "2\nof 11 .8 kg by 30 percent to 15.3 kg by the year 2000. There is a clear risk of conflict between\neconomic growth and employment objectives, and the need for much improved resource and\nenvironmental management and control.\n5. While inshore fishery resources are heavily exploited or overexploited, there are\nopportunities for fisheries development in oftshore waters. The opportunities are to some extent\nbeing taken up by the proposed Bank-financed Fisheries Infrastructure Improvement Project.\nCompared with this, aquaculture has the greatest immediate potential for increasing fish\nproduction and employment. For freshwater aquaculture development, which is not within the\nscope of this TA as it is being addressed through other initiatives,1 the Government's primary\nfocus will be on increasing the supply of domestic protein through integrated aquaculture,\ndevelopment of cage culture in rivers, development of cage culture and fish stocking in\nreservoirs, and increasing rice-fish culture. The Government's specific plans for coastal\naquaculture development, primarily for export, include (i) emphasis on shrimp and crab culture\nover an area of 260,000 ha; (ii) marine cage culture of high-value species such as grouper, sea\nbass, and yellowtail; (iii) mussel and sea cucumber culture; and (iv) seaweed culture for agar\nand alginates (in 15 provinces from the central and northern regions).\n6. Despitethese plans, there are environmental and disease constraints to expanding\naquaculture, especially in coastal areas. Brackish water shrimp culture has been widely\ndeveloped in the coastal provinces of the Mekong Delta, such as Ben Tre, Tra Vinh, Soc Trang,\nand Minh Hai. As a result of the high profitability of successful operations, extensive cultivation\nsystems are being transformed into more intensive shrimp systems, and the huge expansion of\nthe cultivated area has led to the degradation of the mangrove and Melaleuca ecosystems. A\nmajor outbreak of shrimp disease in 1993-1 994 decimated vast areas of ponds. In addition to\nthe environmental constraints, developing sustainable aquaculture in coastal areas requires\nattention to policy, management, incentive structures, and institutional issues, including the need\nto determine the appropriate role for the Government in future development work. Other\nconstraints that need to be addressed include outdated production and processing technology\nand poor flow of information. In the past, the credit components of aquaculture projects often\nmet with limited acceptance by farmers. Examination of the aquaculture credit experience is\nrequired to identify an appropriate credit delivery mechanism.\n7. At the 1992 Viet Nam Fisheries Development Workshop, the Government identified\na number of priority investment projects for funding in the fisheries and aquaculture sector.\nAmong the projects are more than 30 covering large-scale commercial developments for shrimp\nculture, hatchery development, processing and marketing ventures, marine cage culture\noperations, shellfish farming, and related activities. The total costs for development and\nimplementation of the projects were estimated at $140 million. In March 1995, the severe\nenvironmental and economic consequences of unplanned developments were highlighted at the\nFreshwater aquaculture is being pursued under ongoing Ministry of Fisheries programs, and the Ministry of\nAgriculture is providing support services for expanding freshwater aquaculture activities with the assistance\nof agencies such as FAO, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and International Center for\nLiving Aquatic Resources Management (ICLARM).", "3\nWorkshop on Coastal and Marine Environmental Management (see footnote 2, page 1). Bef0re\nfurther incentives to accelerate aquaculture development are provided, the main constraints as\nnoted above in para. 6 need to be thoroughly addressed.\nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objectives\n8. The objectives of the TA are (i) to assist the Government in formulating a\nframework for sustainable development of coastal aquaculture, based on the country's\ncomparative advantage and market opportunities; and (ii) to undertake a preliminary investment\nstudy for coastal aquaculture development.\nB.\t Scope\n9. The TA will include an assessment of coastal aquaculture 1 covering policies and\ninstitutional arrangements, environmental impact, technology, management, and incentives in\nthe context of common property resources, processing, identification of beneficiaries, training\nand extension, and research and development. It will also include organization of a local-level\nparticipatory workshop and a national workshop to obtain feedback on existing constraints,\nperceived opportunities and priorities and appropriate roles for the Government and the private\nsector. The TA will formulate a medium-term strategy for coastal aquaculture development and\ninvestment. The strategy will involve a preliminary assessment of coastal aquaculture investment\ncovering the following topics:\n(i) Institutional analysis and policy reforms. This will include identifying the\nrehabilitation and enhancement requirements of research, training, and\nextension infrastructure for aquaculture; determining the requisite\nimprovements in the regulatory framework and enforcement capability at\nnational and provincial levels; identifying any needed policy reforms (e.g.,\nin areas such as trade, investment, and pricing policies); and identifying\norganizational issues, including human resource development needs in\nresearch, extension, development planning, and management.\n(ii) Development of coastal aquaculture infrastructure and support services.\nThis will include rationalizing and upgrading existing coastal aquaculture\nand related infrastructure; identifying areas with low environmental\nsensitivity for new coastal aquaculture; establishing of central support\nservices (e.g., disease identification and control services and supply of\npathogen-free seed) and mechanisms of transfer and promotion of\nappropriate aquaculture technologies; improving feed processing and\nTaking into account highlights of the Fisheries Sector Strategy and Program (FAC, 1993). More recent\nntiatives, including the work of other funding agencies, will also be assessed to ensure that a coordinated\napproach is adopted.", "4\nhatchery technology; improving processing, quality control and marketing\nof coastal aquaculture products; and enhancing and expanding the\nextension and technology transfer program in coastal aquaculture.\n(iii) Credit. This will include identifying the capital needs for improving the\nefficiency of coastal aquatic farmers and processors as well as for new\ninvestments; examining the range of credit support currently available and\nthe preferences of aquaculture credit users; reviewing credit alternatives\nand, if appropriate, recommending an appropriate delivery mechanism\nand institutional arrangements for channeling credit, which takes into\naccount user preferences.\n(iv) Social considerations. The sociocultural implications of future coastal\naquaculture development will be examined. Major concerns in this regard\nare the role of women in coastal aquaculture, allocations and conflicts\nrelating to the use of land and other resources, social problems relating\nto increased disposable income, alternative employment for coastal\nfisherfolk, and natural resource management under common property\nregimes.\n(v) Environmental concerns. Environmental issues relating to coastal\naquaculture development in Viet Nam will be examined: degradation of\nmangrove and other forest habitats and associated ecological features\nresulting from the conversion of swamps for brackish water pond\ndevelopment, organic loading and the discharge of agrochemical wastes\nfrom aquaculture operations, loss of natural shrimp and fish stock from\nexcessive exploitation of fry and feed, the need to avoid or mitigate\npotential adverse environmental impacts of aquaculture activities, and\ncoastal pollution and disease problems.\nC.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n10. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $652,000, comprising $500,000 in foreign\nexchange and $152,000 equivalent in local currency as shown in Appendix 1. The Bank will\nprovide a grant of $600,000 to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and a portion ($100,000)\nof the local currency cost. The Government will provide the remaining local currency cost\n($52,000) from its own resources. The Government has been informed that approval of the TA\ndoes not necessarily commit the Bank to finance any ensuing project.\nD.\t Implementation Arrangements\n11. The duration of the TA will be five months. It is expected to start in November 1995\nand be completed in April 1996. A team of consultants will be recruited and engaged by the\nBank through a qualified firm in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants\n(see Appendix 2). The executing agency for the TA will be the Ministry of Fisheries (MOF), where\na project coordinator will be assigned on a full time basis together with supporting staff and\ncounterpart facilities required for the TA. Provision will be made in the TA for rental of a service\nvehicle and the engagement of local supporting staff (interpreter and assistants).", "5\n12. The activities of the consultants will be complemented by a working group to be\nconvened by MOF with the assistance of the consultants. Members of the working group will\ninclude potential beneficiaries, concerned agencies (especially the MOF, the State Planning\nCommittee, Ministry of Finance, the Viet Nam Bank for Agriculture, and the Ministry of Forestry),\nprivate sector representatives, and nongovernment organizations. The working group wifl ensure\nthat there is broad understanding of, and commitment to the activities of the TA with respect to\ncoastal aquaculture development, and that the consultant team achieves adequate contact with\nand access to senior decision makers and fully understands existing policies, practices, and the\nplans of the Government and the private sector. The consultants will also need the working\ngroup's feedback to the concepts and ideas arising from fieldwork and from international\nexperience.\n13. There will be two workshops: one local-level workshop in Ca Mau, the capital city\nof Minh Hal Province (a very important coastal aquaculture center), and one national-level\nworkshop in either Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City. The local-level workshop will give the necessary\nopportunity for the stakeholders - representatives of the main existing and future participant\ngroups, including the relevant Government institutions, and commercial and household level\naquatic farmers, processors, marketing interests, retail buyers and exporters \u2014to fully participate\nand express their views about the major constraints and opportunities, the policy framework, and\nrelated design and implementation issues. The national-level workshop will ensure that a full\nexchange of views at senior level is achieved so that there is full commitment to the proposed\ndevelopment strategy and priority investments that will emerge from the work of the consultant\nteam.\n14. It is estimated that a total of 16 person-months of international expertise and\n16 person-months of local expertise will be required. The international expertise will comprise\na fufl-time team leader (aquaculture specialist/planner), and expertise in the areas of aquaculture\nengineering, aquaculture economics and credit, aquatic environment, and marketing/processing.\nThe local expertise will cover institutions/policy and planning, aquaculture engineering,\naquaculture/rural extension, rural sociology/women-in-development, and coastal land use\nplanning.\n15. The consultants will prepare an inception report at the end of the first month, a\nworkshop report at the end of month 3, and a draft final report at the end of month 4. All reports\nwill be considered in a tripartite meeting among representatives of the Government, and the\nBank, and the consultants. The final report will be submitted at the end of month 5.\nIV. THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n16. The President, acting under the authority delegated to hirr by the Board, has\napproved the provision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, to the Government of the\nSocialist Republic of Viet Nam in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 for the\npurpose of the Coastal Aquaculture Development Study and hereby repo ts his action to the\nBoard.\n....\t ..\t ..........\t ...\t -..\t .....\t ...\t...\t...", "\t\nAppendix 1\n6\nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN\n($)\nForeign\t Local\t Total\nItem\t Currency\t Currency\nA.

INTRODUCTION\n1. The rehabilitation of Viet Nam's critical fisheries infrastructure and the development\nof sustainable aquaculture were first identified as urgent needs by a Bank Fisheries Sector\nReview Mission1 in December 1992. Subsequently, a team of international consultants briefly\nreviewed the aquaculture subsector in 1993 under funding arrangements with the Canadian\nInternational Development Agency (CIDA), during a feasibility study for the Fisheries\nInfrastructure Improvement Project. Recent work has provided an overview of the main influences\non coastal and marine management and the fragile ecosystems in which much of Viet Nam's\ncoastal aquaculture development has taken place.2\n2. Concern about the rapid expansion of aquaculture, the resultant large-scale\ndegradation of coastal mangrove and Melaleuca forest areas, and a massive outbreak of shrimp\ndisease in 1993-1994 has led the Government to request the Bank for technical assistance (TA)\nin the development of sustainable coastal aquaculture.3 The TA was initially discussed by a loan\nFact-finding Mission for the Fisheries Infrastructure Improvement Project in April 1994. A Follow-\nup Mission visited Viet Nam from 13 to 17 February 1995, during which an understanding was\nreached with the Government on the objectives, scope, and terms of reference for the TA\nconsultants, estimated costs and financing plan, and implementation arrangements for the TA.\nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n3. Estimates of Viet Nam's annual sustainable catch for marine fish range from\n1 .2 million to 1 .4 million tons, and the country has about 1 .4 million hectares of total inland water\narea suitable for aquaculture development. Adding to this aquaculture potential are over 300,000\nha of tidal areas and hundreds of thousands of hectares of straits and bays suitable for\nmariculture.\n4. According to its development objectives, the Government intends to produce\n1 .6 million tons of fish by the year 2,000 by increasing the marine fish catch from 0.88 million\ntons (1994) to 1 million tons and aquaculture production from 0.33 tons (1994) to 0.60 million\ntons. This target is based on the remaining balance of marine fish and aquaculture resources\nand the past record of overall production growth, i.e., 22 percent for the marine catch and\n43 percent for aquaculture since 1986. The Government also aims to achieve a fishery export\nvalue of $1 billion, up from $458 million in 1994, and increase the 1993 per capita fish supply\nBased on the findings of a loint fisheries sector review mission from the Bank and the Food and Agriculture\nOrganization of the United Nations (FAO), which visited Viet Nam in December 1990.\nFor example, see case study material prepared under RETA 5552: Coastal and Marine Environmental\nManagement in the South China Sea - Workshop on Coastal and Marine Environmental Management\n(WCMEM) and Consultative Meeting (27-29 March 1995); and Results of a Survey on Shrimp Disease in Minh\nHai Province, Viet Nam (Faculty of Aquaculture, Can Tho University).\nThe TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in June 1994 as a Project Preparation TA. It was\nsubsequently decided that an assessment of the coastal aquaculture subsector and the development of\nstrategic priorities were required prior to the preparation of a future coastal aquaculture development project.\nThe advisory TA, as now proposed, will adopt a participatory approach to the subsector analysis as well as\nto the identification of potential areas for future detailed project preparation.\n-...\t I\t \u2022", "2\nof 11 .8 kg by 30 percent to 15.3 kg by the year 2000. There is a clear risk of conflict between\neconomic growth and employment objectives, and the need for much improved resource and\nenvironmental management and control.\n5. While inshore fishery resources are heavily exploited or overexploited, there are\nopportunities for fisheries development in oftshore waters. The opportunities are to some extent\nbeing taken up by the proposed Bank-financed Fisheries Infrastructure Improvement Project.\nCompared with this, aquaculture has the greatest immediate potential for increasing fish\nproduction and employment. For freshwater aquaculture development, which is not within the\nscope of this TA as it is being addressed through other initiatives,1 the Government's primary\nfocus will be on increasing the supply of domestic protein through integrated aquaculture,\ndevelopment of cage culture in rivers, development of cage culture and fish stocking in\nreservoirs, and increasing rice-fish culture. The Government's specific plans for coastal\naquaculture development, primarily for export, include (i) emphasis on shrimp and crab culture\nover an area of 260,000 ha; (ii) marine cage culture of high-value species such as grouper, sea\nbass, and yellowtail; (iii) mussel and sea cucumber culture; and (iv) seaweed culture for agar\nand alginates (in 15 provinces from the central and northern regions).\n6. Despitethese plans, there are environmental and disease constraints to expanding\naquaculture, especially in coastal areas. Brackish water shrimp culture has been widely\ndeveloped in the coastal provinces of the Mekong Delta, such as Ben Tre, Tra Vinh, Soc Trang,\nand Minh Hai. As a result of the high profitability of successful operations, extensive cultivation\nsystems are being transformed into more intensive shrimp systems, and the huge expansion of\nthe cultivated area has led to the degradation of the mangrove and Melaleuca ecosystems. A\nmajor outbreak of shrimp disease in 1993-1 994 decimated vast areas of ponds. In addition to\nthe environmental constraints, developing sustainable aquaculture in coastal areas requires\nattention to policy, management, incentive structures, and institutional issues, including the need\nto determine the appropriate role for the Government in future development work. Other\nconstraints that need to be addressed include outdated production and processing technology\nand poor flow of information. In the past, the credit components of aquaculture projects often\nmet with limited acceptance by farmers. Examination of the aquaculture credit experience is\nrequired to identify an appropriate credit delivery mechanism.\n7. At the 1992 Viet Nam Fisheries Development Workshop, the Government identified\na number of priority investment projects for funding in the fisheries and aquaculture sector.\nAmong the projects are more than 30 covering large-scale commercial developments for shrimp\nculture, hatchery development, processing and marketing ventures, marine cage culture\noperations, shellfish farming, and related activities. The total costs for development and\nimplementation of the projects were estimated at $140 million. In March 1995, the severe\nenvironmental and economic consequences of unplanned developments were highlighted at the\nFreshwater aquaculture is being pursued under ongoing Ministry of Fisheries programs, and the Ministry of\nAgriculture is providing support services for expanding freshwater aquaculture activities with the assistance\nof agencies such as FAO, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and International Center for\nLiving Aquatic Resources Management (ICLARM).", "3\nWorkshop on Coastal and Marine Environmental Management (see footnote 2, page 1). Bef0re\nfurther incentives to accelerate aquaculture development are provided, the main constraints as\nnoted above in para. 6 need to be thoroughly addressed.\nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objectives\n8. The objectives of the TA are (i) to assist the Government in formulating a\nframework for sustainable development of coastal aquaculture, based on the country's\ncomparative advantage and market opportunities; and (ii) to undertake a preliminary investment\nstudy for coastal aquaculture development.\nB.\t Scope\n9. The TA will include an assessment of coastal aquaculture 1 covering policies and\ninstitutional arrangements, environmental impact, technology, management, and incentives in\nthe context of common property resources, processing, identification of beneficiaries, training\nand extension, and research and development. It will also include organization of a local-level\nparticipatory workshop and a national workshop to obtain feedback on existing constraints,\nperceived opportunities and priorities and appropriate roles for the Government and the private\nsector. The TA will formulate a medium-term strategy for coastal aquaculture development and\ninvestment. The strategy will involve a preliminary assessment of coastal aquaculture investment\ncovering the following topics:\n(i) Institutional analysis and policy reforms. This will include identifying the\nrehabilitation and enhancement requirements of research, training, and\nextension infrastructure for aquaculture; determining the requisite\nimprovements in the regulatory framework and enforcement capability at\nnational and provincial levels; identifying any needed policy reforms (e.g.,\nin areas such as trade, investment, and pricing policies); and identifying\norganizational issues, including human resource development needs in\nresearch, extension, development planning, and management.\n(ii) Development of coastal aquaculture infrastructure and support services.\nThis will include rationalizing and upgrading existing coastal aquaculture\nand related infrastructure; identifying areas with low environmental\nsensitivity for new coastal aquaculture; establishing of central support\nservices (e.g., disease identification and control services and supply of\npathogen-free seed) and mechanisms of transfer and promotion of\nappropriate aquaculture technologies; improving feed processing and\nTaking into account highlights of the Fisheries Sector Strategy and Program (FAC, 1993). More recent\nntiatives, including the work of other funding agencies, will also be assessed to ensure that a coordinated\napproach is adopted.", "4\nhatchery technology; improving processing, quality control and marketing\nof coastal aquaculture products; and enhancing and expanding the\nextension and technology transfer program in coastal aquaculture.\n(iii) Credit. This will include identifying the capital needs for improving the\nefficiency of coastal aquatic farmers and processors as well as for new\ninvestments; examining the range of credit support currently available and\nthe preferences of aquaculture credit users; reviewing credit alternatives\nand, if appropriate, recommending an appropriate delivery mechanism\nand institutional arrangements for channeling credit, which takes into\naccount user preferences.\n(iv) Social considerations. The sociocultural implications of future coastal\naquaculture development will be examined. Major concerns in this regard\nare the role of women in coastal aquaculture, allocations and conflicts\nrelating to the use of land and other resources, social problems relating\nto increased disposable income, alternative employment for coastal\nfisherfolk, and natural resource management under common property\nregimes.\n(v) Environmental concerns. Environmental issues relating to coastal\naquaculture development in Viet Nam will be examined: degradation of\nmangrove and other forest habitats and associated ecological features\nresulting from the conversion of swamps for brackish water pond\ndevelopment, organic loading and the discharge of agrochemical wastes\nfrom aquaculture operations, loss of natural shrimp and fish stock from\nexcessive exploitation of fry and feed, the need to avoid or mitigate\npotential adverse environmental impacts of aquaculture activities, and\ncoastal pollution and disease problems.\nC.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n10. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $652,000, comprising $500,000 in foreign\nexchange and $152,000 equivalent in local currency as shown in Appendix 1. The Bank will\nprovide a grant of $600,000 to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and a portion ($100,000)\nof the local currency cost. The Government will provide the remaining local currency cost\n($52,000) from its own resources. The Government has been informed that approval of the TA\ndoes not necessarily commit the Bank to finance any ensuing project.\nD.\t Implementation Arrangements\n11. The duration of the TA will be five months. It is expected to start in November 1995\nand be completed in April 1996. A team of consultants will be recruited and engaged by the\nBank through a qualified firm in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants\n(see Appendix 2). The executing agency for the TA will be the Ministry of Fisheries (MOF), where\na project coordinator will be assigned on a full time basis together with supporting staff and\ncounterpart facilities required for the TA. Provision will be made in the TA for rental of a service\nvehicle and the engagement of local supporting staff (interpreter and assistants).", "5\n12. The activities of the consultants will be complemented by a working group to be\nconvened by MOF with the assistance of the consultants. Members of the working group will\ninclude potential beneficiaries, concerned agencies (especially the MOF, the State Planning\nCommittee, Ministry of Finance, the Viet Nam Bank for Agriculture, and the Ministry of Forestry),\nprivate sector representatives, and nongovernment organizations. The working group wifl ensure\nthat there is broad understanding of, and commitment to the activities of the TA with respect to\ncoastal aquaculture development, and that the consultant team achieves adequate contact with\nand access to senior decision makers and fully understands existing policies, practices, and the\nplans of the Government and the private sector. The consultants will also need the working\ngroup's feedback to the concepts and ideas arising from fieldwork and from international\nexperience.\n13. There will be two workshops: one local-level workshop in Ca Mau, the capital city\nof Minh Hal Province (a very important coastal aquaculture center), and one national-level\nworkshop in either Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City. The local-level workshop will give the necessary\nopportunity for the stakeholders - representatives of the main existing and future participant\ngroups, including the relevant Government institutions, and commercial and household level\naquatic farmers, processors, marketing interests, retail buyers and exporters \u2014to fully participate\nand express their views about the major constraints and opportunities, the policy framework, and\nrelated design and implementation issues. The national-level workshop will ensure that a full\nexchange of views at senior level is achieved so that there is full commitment to the proposed\ndevelopment strategy and priority investments that will emerge from the work of the consultant\nteam.\n14. It is estimated that a total of 16 person-months of international expertise and\n16 person-months of local expertise will be required. The international expertise will comprise\na fufl-time team leader (aquaculture specialist/planner), and expertise in the areas of aquaculture\nengineering, aquaculture economics and credit, aquatic environment, and marketing/processing.\nThe local expertise will cover institutions/policy and planning, aquaculture engineering,\naquaculture/rural extension, rural sociology/women-in-development, and coastal land use\nplanning.\n15. The consultants will prepare an inception report at the end of the first month, a\nworkshop report at the end of month 3, and a draft final report at the end of month 4. All reports\nwill be considered in a tripartite meeting among representatives of the Government, and the\nBank, and the consultants. The final report will be submitted at the end of month 5.\nIV.
