Water scarcity and deteriorating water quality are critical concerns to many countries in \nthe Asia and Pacific region. Rapid population growth, urbanization, and underperformance of \nexisting water assets are contributing to a significant shortfall in water services. The region\u2019s \nfresh  water  resources\u2500river  basins,  watersheds,  and  wetlands\u2500are  already  in  peril  from \npollution and fragmented management. Climate change will cause further impacts to these \nresources and add complexity and urgency to the challenge for better water management.  \n \n2.  Adopted in 2001, of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Water for All policy fosters \nintegrated water resources management (IWRM), as well as improvements in water service \ndelivery. Across the region, ADB clients have adopted IWRM, and an increasing number of \nwater loans are now prepared for river basins. In 2005-2006, one third of approved water \ntechnical assistance (TA) activities and one quarter of approved water loans were for river basin \ninvestments. Most of these investments involved the establishment or strengthening of a river \nbasin organization (RBO) to facilitate IWRM.  \n3.  By fostering IWRM in river basins, the Water for All policy underscores the need to shift \nfrom fragmented and sector-based project planning to a cross-sectoral process that is holistic \nand  inclusive.  IWRM,  a  long-term  process  that  needs  sustained  commitment  by  all \nstakeholders, seeks to realize investments in water resources development and management \nthat have a \u201ctriple bottom line\u201d, i.e., economic, social, and environmental benefits that result \nfrom an integrated approach. IWRM promotes coordinated development and management of \nwater, land, and related resources to maximize economic benefits and social welfare equitably \nwithout compromising the sustainability of vital ecosystems.1  \n4.  In March 2003, at the 3rd World Water Forum in Kyoto, Japan, ADB signed a letter of \nintent with the Water Resources Development Public Corporation of Japan (now the Japan \nWater Agency) and the ADB Institute to launch the Network of Asian River Basin Organizations \n(NARBO). NARBO aims to help introduce IWRM in river basins and to strengthen RBOs\u2019 \ncapacity and effectiveness in promoting IWRM and improving water governance. NARBO was \nformally  established  in  February  2004  with  its  own  charter  and  now  has  65  member \norganizations from 12 countries in the region. The NARBO chair is from Indonesia, and the vice-\nchair is from Sri Lanka. NARBO\u2019s secretariat comprises the Japan Water Agency, ADB, and the \nADB Institute.  \n \n5.  In March 2006, at the 4th World Water Forum in Mexico City, Mexico, ADB announced \nits Water Financing Program (WFP) for 2006-2010 to double water investments and achieve \ntargeted outcomes through rural, urban, and basin water investments. WFP\u2019s basin water target \nis to help introduce IWRM in 25 river basins.2 To achieve this target, ADB has developed a list \nof important IWRM elements and a generic road map to assess progress.  \n \n6.  In 2006, NARBO\u2019s 2nd General Meeting requested that ADB: (i) lead the introduction of \nRBO performance benchmarking and peer review; (ii) support capacity development in RBOs; \n                                                 \n1  This is the definition of IWRM by the Global Water Partnership that has been adopted in ADB. 2001. Water for All. \nManila. \n2  To date, 20 river basins have already been identified by ADB\u2019s regional departments, with another five to be \nconfirmed. See http://www.adb.org/Water/Operations/WFP/basin.asp#2. \n ", "2   \n(iii)  chart  the  progress  of  IWRM  in  river  basins  in  the  region;  and  (iv)  facilitate  further \ninvestments in river basin projects to introduce IWRM, involving RBOs as facilitators.3  \n \n7.  To date, progress in performance benchmarking and peer review has been encouraging, \nwith ten RBOs volunteering to join the process, and four RBOs completing their peer review by \n2007.4 ADB has continued to support training programs and workshops for NARBO members, \nincluding one on water rights in May 2007. ADB has also consulted with the World Conservation \nUnion (IUCN)5 in developing a regional TA project6 to chart IWRM progress in river basins in \nthe region and in promoting further IWRM investments under NARBO. The TA design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n8.  Under WFP, ADB has committed to doubling its water investments during 2006-2010 to \nwell over $2 billion per year. The overall target for ADB\u2019s lending under WFP is $10 billion, of \nwhich  basin  water  investments  are  expected  to  contribute  approximately  25%.  Under  this \nscenario,  ADB  seeks  to  increase  basin  water  investments  under  WFP  to  \napproximately $3 billion. To deliver the additional investments, ADB needs to expand its basin \nwater  operations  with  long-term  IWRM  investment  programs  in  river  basins  that  include \ninfrastructure, management reforms, and capacity development. Regional cooperation through \nthe Asia-Pacific Water Forum (APWF) and NARBO is crucial to supporting these investment \nprograms and will allow ADB to provide strategic assistance to its country programs.  \n9.  Water  governance\u2014how  people  and  their  institutions  work  together,  make  correct \ninvestment decisions, and implement them effectively\u2014is key to delivering sustainable solutions \nto immediate problems. Therefore, stakeholder participation, local actions, and ownership are \nnecessary building blocks for achieving IWRM in river basins. Stakeholders\u2019 active and informed \nparticipation in planning and decision-making for integrated investment programs, including \nwater  resources  allocation,  conflict  resolution,  and  trade-off  choices,  is  central  to  IWRM\u2019s \nsuccess.  The  independent  panel  reviewing  ADB\u2019s  water  policy  implementation  in  2006 \nreiterated the need for ADB to promote more river basin investment projects with stakeholder \nownership of the IWRM process. \n10.  In the past decade, most countries in the region have already adopted national water \npolicies that advocate IWRM in river basins. However, IWRM implementation is still at an early \nstage, and exchanging experience and analyzing lessons learned is an effective way to catalyze \nfurther  investments.  Through  NARBO,  it  is  now  possible  to  provide  quality  programs  for \nexchanging information and experience, and building capacity to help introduce IWRM in river \nbasins. RBOs are crucial in facilitating IWRM introduction, including regulatory changes with \nstakeholder involvement, and preparation of further investments. \n \n                                                 \n3  Staff from ADB\u2019s Southeast Asia Department, Mekong Department, and Regional and Sustainable Development \nDepartment participated in this February 2006 general meeting, held in Indonesia. \n4  Performance benchmarking and peer reviews have to date been completed in the Citarum River Basin (Indonesia), \nMahaweli River Basin (Sri Lanka), Laguna de Bay Lake Basin (Philippines), and Red River (Viet Nam). \n5  IUCN is an active member and knowledge partner of NARBO, and implements the comprehensive Water and \nNature Initiative in Asia and other regions. This initiative demonstrates good practices in selected river basins to \nimprove water management for healthy rivers and communities, supported by tools for financing, governance, \nempowerment, and information. \n6  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 30 October 2007. \n ", "3 \n11.  Working with NARBO partners and drawing on lessons learned from earlier projects \nacross  the  region,  ADB  has  identified  four  challenges  to  encouraging  further  basin  water \ninvestments in the region that will be addressed through the proposed TA. First, RBOs\u2019 capacity \nto prepare new IWRM investments must be strengthened. Increasingly, RBOs play a facilitating \nrole in preparing new investment programs that are based on local knowledge and strong \ncollaboration among a basin\u2019s government and non-government stakeholders. To develop their \ncapacity for this role, RBOs need assistance to develop road maps for long-term integrated \nIWRM  investment  programs. 7   Second,  RBOs  need  better  information  to  improve  their \nperformance  in  adapting  IWRM  to  a  basin\u2019s  changing  needs,  including  those  caused  by \nurbanization, decentralization, and climate change. Third, a systematic assessment of IWRM \nprogress across the region is needed to learn lessons and identify requirements and good \npractices for further investments. Fourth, further capacity development programs for RBOs are \nnecessary to improve their performance in delivering results.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The proposed TA aims to encourage further basin water investments under WFP and \ndemonstrate good practices in introducing IWRM in river basins across the region. This will be \nachieved by: (i) enabling RBOs to prepare road maps for long-term integrated river basin \ninvestment programs, (ii) improving RBO\u2019s technical knowledge to introduce IWRM and adapt to \nriver  basins\u2019  changing  needs,  (iii)  assessing  country  performance  and  good  practices  in \nintroducing IWRM  in  river  basins,  and  (iv)  improving  RBOs\u2019  performance  through  capacity \ndevelopment.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The proposed TA will have four components: (i) a project development facility, (ii) RBO \nknowledge  service,  (iii)  country  performance  assessments,  and  (iv)  RBO  performance \nimprovement.  \n \n14.  Project Development Facility. A road map advisory service (RAS), which will be piloted \nin five river basins across the region, will be developed to help RBOs in preparing road maps for \nlong-term  integrated  river  basin  investment  programs.  The  five  pilot  river  basins  are  the \nBaitarani in India, Vu Gia-Thu Bon in Viet Nam, Bicol in the Philippines, Bengawan Solo in \nIndonesia, and the four Ps river basin area (Prek Preah, Prek Krieng, Prek Kampi, and Prek Te) \nin Cambodia.8 During TA inception, RAS guidelines will be developed to define objectives, \nprocess, requirements, and outputs. In the first stage, the RBOs in the pilot basins, with their \nown resources, will prepare or update a river basin profile in collaboration with stakeholders and \nthe RAS guidelines. In the second stage, a small RAS team of international and national \nspecialists  and  NARBO  peer  experts  will  visit  the  basin  to  conduct  a  river  basin  profile \nassessment to identify IWRM investment needs. This stage will end with a basin stakeholder \nworkshop to discuss the assessment\u2019s findings and develop a road map outline for a long-term \nintegrated river basin investment program. In the third stage, the RBO will finalize the road map, \nand a second basin stakeholder workshop will be held to review it. The RAS team will provide \n                                                 \n7  The recently prepared road map for a proposed integrated investment program in Indonesia\u2019s Citarum River Basin \nis a good example. It sets out a phased IWRM investment program over 15 years.  \n8  RAS development will draw on ADB\u2019s earlier work in defining IWRM elements and a generic road map for \nperformance in river basins. See http://adb.org/Water/Operations/WFP/basin.asp.\n ", "4   \nfurther advice as needed in helping the RBO to finalize the road map, which will then serve as \nbasis for future project preparatory TA for an investment project. \n \n15.  RBO Knowledge Service. Up-to-date information and knowledge will be compiled and \nprovided to better equip RBOs in addressing changing river basin management needs for IWRM, \nincluding urbanization, decentralization, stakeholder collaboration, water rights and allocation, \nadaptation to climate change, and integrating environmental management in infrastructure and \nwater  services  development.  Online  access and  dissemination  of  knowledge  products  and \nservices will be improved through a regional knowledge hub under APWF.  \n \n16.  Country Performance Assessments. Systematic country performance assessments \nwill be conducted to chart the progress of introducing IWRM against monitorable indicators and \nto gather experience and lessons learned from basin projects implemented to date. These \nassessments will involve national water sector apex bodies, key water agencies, RBOs, and \nother stakeholders, and will result in specific recommendations for investment programs to \naddress the changing needs in IWRM. Dialogues on assessment results will be held with \nstakeholders. The results will be disseminated in a publication that will highlight the region\u2019s \noverall performance, challenges, lessons learned, and opportunities for basin water investments.  \n \n17.  RBO Performance Improvement. Capacity development activities will be organized to \nimprove RBO performance through diagnostic assessments, training programs, workshops, and \nseminars. These are expected to include: (i) training workshops for RBOs and stakeholders on \npreparing investment road maps with the RAS, (ii) peer reviewer certification training for senior \nRBO staff to conduct NARBO\u2019s performance benchmarking service, (iii) leadership training for \nRBO champions in implementing IWRM and organizational changes, and (iv) seminars on \nadapting to the changing needs in IWRM and on improving water governance.9  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n18.  The total cost of the proposed TA is estimated at $2,000,000. The proposed TA will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The \ntotal cost of the project development facility (component 1) is estimated at about $1,000,000, of \nwhich the direct costs of the RAS pilot in the five basins are estimated at $600,000, or 30% of \nthe overall TA cost.10 The cost estimates for components 2, 3, and 4 amount to $300,000, \n$400,000, and $300,000, respectively.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  The proposed TA will be executed by ADB through the Energy, Transport, and Water \nDivision of the Regional and Sustainable Development Department, in collaboration with the \nBasin Water Stream of ADB\u2019s Water Community of Practice, concerned regional departments, \nand resident missions.  \n \n20.  The organizational arrangements will include a TA team of specialists, which is expected \nto form part of the regional knowledge hub in Indonesia for river basin organizations and \n                                                 \n9  The training will draw on ADB\u2019s earlier experience in developing and piloting NARBO\u2019s performance benchmarking \nand peer review service in four river basins since 2005. \n10  In accordance with ADB. 2007. Operations Manual. Section D12/BP: Business Products and Instruments. Manila. \n(4 June), para. 46, which states that a portion of a TA amount may be used for pilot testing of projects with \ninnovative approaches before large-scale implementation. The amount allocated to pilot testing normally does not \nexceed 30% of ADB financing for the TA. \n ", "5 \nmanagement under APWF.11 Implementation of the project development facility for the pilot \nbasins will also involve staff from the concerned RBOs, water agencies, and other government \nagencies  and  stakeholders  in  the  five  countries,  as  appropriate.  Senior  experts  from \ndevelopment partner organizations will be invited to advise key stages of TA implementation, \nespecially during inception, RAS piloting, and TA workshops to review draft outputs. This TA \nadvisory group is expected to include experts from the NARBO secretariat and knowledge \npartners, such as the Japan Water Agency, Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), \nIWMI, IUCN, APWF, and the Japan Water Forum (APWF\u2019s secretariat). The organizational \narrangements will be finalized during an inception workshop within the first three months of TA \nimplementation. \n \n21.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 24 months, starting July 2008 and ending in \nJune 2010.  \n \n22.  ADB  will  engage  the  services  of  two  international  consultants  for  a  total  of  30  \nperson-months: (i) a senior IWRM specialist (24 person-months) as team leader, and (ii) a \nknowledge management specialist (6 person-months) for the publication and dissemination \nactivities. ADB will also engage 11 national consultants for a total of 26 person-months: (i) a TA \ncoordinator  (6  person-months)  at  ADB  headquarters  to  monitor  and  coordinate  the \nimplementation  of  TA  activities  with  ADB\u2019s  Water  Community  of  Practice  and  regional \ndepartments; and (ii) 10 project specialists (2 person-months each, with expertise in either water \nresources, environment, or governance, as needed) to support the RAS in the pilot basins. The \nmethod of consultant selection will be decided during implementation. All consultants will be \nengaged by ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended from time to time). The outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix \n3. Equipment and vehicles will be procured following ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as \namended from time to time). It is expected that the TA team will use the vehicles at the regional \nknowledge hub, which will be turned over to the hub at TA completion.  \n \n23.  The TA team of consultants will submit (i) an inception report at the end of the third \nmonth following mobilization; (ii) quarterly progress reports; (iii) an interim report at the end of \nthe twelfth month; (iv) a draft final report at the end of the twenty-second month; and (v) a final \nreport that incorporates comments by ADB, concerned RBOs, the TA advisory group, and \nstakeholders. Meetings between ADB and the TA team, including other concerned parties, will \nbe held following report submission and as often as necessary. The TA\u2019s outputs will be posted \non ADB\u2019s web site. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION  \n \n24.  The President recommends that the Board approve the provision of technical assistance \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $2,000,000 on a grant basis for Managing Water in Asia\u2019s River \nBasins: Charting Progress and Facilitating Investment. \n                                                 \n11  The establishment by Indonesia of a regional knowledge hub for river basin organizations and management was \nannounced at the 1st Asia-Pacific Water Summit in Japan in December 2007, and started in March 2008. \n ", "6    Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance Targets  Data Sources and/or  Assumptions  \nSummary  and/or Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \n       \nQuality of water  Implementation of  APWF and ADB water  \u2022 Stronger enabling environment \nresources management  IWRM in the region  reports on region\u2019s  for IWRM including updated \nis improved and  significantly improved   progress   legislation  \nprogress of IWRM       \nimplementation in the  Basin water targets  WFP reports  \u2022 Political will and commitment of \nAsia and Pacific region  under WFP achieved    governments and RBOs to \nis accelerated    UNESCAP-ADB progress  implement IWRM  \nWater-related MDG  reports on MDGs   \ntargets achieved in the  Risk \nregion by 2015   \n\u2022 Low priority for basin water \ninvestments for IWRM  \nOutcome      Assumptions \n       \nBasin water  Number of basin water  WFP reports  \u2022 Technical and institutional \ninvestments under  projects identified in    capacities for IWRM \nWFP encouraged  WFP   Basin plans and WFP  \u2022 Financing for IWRM \n    reports   investments are available  \nDemonstrated good  Good practices for     \npractices in introducing  IWRM demonstrated in  Knowledge products,  Risks \nIWRM in river basins   WFP  RBO reports, and web   \n    sites  \u2022 Lack of technical and \nEnhanced RBO  RBOs train staff and    institutional capacities for IWRM \nknowledge in new basin  basin stakeholders  NARBO performance   \nchallenges    benchmarking service  \u2022 Lack of coordination resulting in \n    fragmented investments  \nImproved RBO  Higher performance \nperformance  ratings of RBOs  \nOutputs      Assumptions \n       \n1.
