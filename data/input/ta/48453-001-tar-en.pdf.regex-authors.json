INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) cluster will support the development \nof carbon capture, utilization, and sequestration (CCUS) as a crucial climate change mitigation \ntechnology  in  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC).1 The  TA  cluster  will  support  (i)  the \ndevelopment  of  enabling  policies,  regulations,  and  incentives  needed  to  make  CCUS \ndemonstration projects commercially viable, (ii) capacity development of project developers to \nundertake  critical  analytical  work  needed  to  design  CCUS  demonstration  projects,  and \n(iii) feasibility assessments for large-scale CCUS demonstration projects.2 \n \n2.  The TA was developed on the request of the Government of the PRC in collaboration with \nthe National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) to implement key recommendations \nof the road map for carbon capture and storage (CCS) demonstration and deployment in the \nPRC.3 While the TA was not included in the PRC country operations business plan, 2017\u20132019, \nclimate change and environmentally sustainable growth are identified as strategic priorities of \nADB assistance to the PRC.4 The TA is also well aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020 and its \ndevelopment agenda of achieving environmentally sustainable growth.5  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  To meet its nationally determined contributions in line with the Paris Climate Agreement \nof 2015, the PRC has committed to achieve peaking of carbon dioxide (CO ) emissions and \n2\ndecrease its carbon intensity by 60%\u201365% from its 2005 levels by 2030. The PRC is one of the \nfew countries that have included CCUS in their nationally determined contributions. The PRC \ndepends heavily on fossil fuels, which account for more than 85% of primary energy supply in the \nPRC. To diversify its energy mix, the PRC has committed to increase the share of renewable \nenergy to 15% by 2020, and to 20% by 2030. The government may also consider reining in \nemissions from fossil-fuel-based industrial and power plants by announcing more stringent \nemission standards. Since CCUS is currently the only available near-commercial technology that \ncan abate 90% or more of CO  emissions from fossil-fuel-based industrial and power plants, its \n2\nearly demonstration in multiple applications will help pave its timely deployment. \n \n4.  Since the Eleventh Five-Year Plan, 2006\u20132010, the PRC has included the research of \nCCUS  in  its  National  High-Tech  Development  Program  and  in  collaboration  with  diverse \ndevelopment partners has focused on capacity building, policy development, and pilot testing of \ntechnology components in the field of CCS.6 This also includes the combination with CO -\n2\nenhanced oil recovery (EOR), the most common use of captured CO . To date, the government \n2\nhas  invested  an  estimated  CNY3  billion  in  CCUS  development,  which  resulted  in  the \nimplementation and testing of 14 pilot projects covering currently available carbon capture and \nCO  sequestration technologies, including CO -EOR.7  \n2 2\n \n                                                \n1  The terms carbon capture and storage (CCS) and carbon capture, utilization, and sequestration (CCUS) are used \ninterchangeably.  \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 21 December 2016. \n3  ADB. 2015. Roadmap for Carbon Capture and Storage Demonstration and Deployment in the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina. Manila.  \n4  ADB. 2017. Country Operations Business Plan: People's Republic of China, 2017\u20132019. Manila. \n5  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n6  ADB, in cooperation with the NDRC, has been supporting the promotion of CCUS in the PRC since 2009. \n7  Technologies promoted by the government include precombustion, post-combustion, and oxy-fuel combustion \ncapture at coal chemical industrial plants, as well as coal and natural gas power plants. \n ", "2 \n5.  In a joint effort, ADB and the NDRC developed the road map for CCS demonstration and \ndeployment in the PRC, which was launched at a side event of the Conference of the Parties \n(COP21) Climate Summit in 2015 by the ADB President and the PRC\u2019s special envoy on climate \nchange. The road map combines a long-term strategy with clear short-term actions to kick-start \nCCUS demonstration within the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan (2016\u20132020) period.8 To promote the \nlong-term deployment of CCUS, the road map calls for the establishment of five to ten early-stage \ndemonstration projects in the coal chemical industry and of one to three projects in the electricity \nsector during the 13th plan period.9  \n \n6.  However,  significant  barriers  to  a  large-scale  demonstration  exist  because  several \ningredients are lacking: (i) a clear policy framework; (ii) commercial viability in the absence of \nfiscal support policies, a sufficiently high carbon price, and dedicated funding; (iii) a financial \nsupport program for cost-intensive pre-investment analyses and activities; (iv) environmental \nmanagement standards, post-closure stewardship regulations, and a clearly defined approval \nprocess for projects; (v) a dedicated institution to facilitate CCUS demonstration; (vi) experience \nin negotiating and signing CO  offtake agreements to facilitate the commercial cooperation \n2\nbetween emitting plants, and oil and gas companies; and (vii) certainty on storage potential and \nfeasibility of CO -EOR, which requires more detailed and cost-intensive storage site assessment. \n2\n \n7.  To remove these barriers and to help the first set of CCUS projects proceed to investment \nstage, the TA cluster will develop the capacity of relevant agencies, undertake critical analytical \nwork, and support feasibility assessments of large-scale demonstration projects that are in various \nstages of development. Advancing a critical number of diverse CCUS demonstration projects is \ncrucially important for the successful outcome of the demonstration phase, as well as setting up \nthe right policies and enabling environment for its subsequent uptake.  \n \nIII.  JUSTIFICATION FOR CLUSTER MODALITY \n \n8.  A TA cluster approach was determined to be the most appropriate means of supporting \nthe development of large-scale CCUS demonstration projects in the PRC. Strategically linked \nsubprojects will support a program of activities covering capacity development, critical techno-\neconomic analytical work, and the development of enabling policies and regulatory requirements, \nwith the common objective of advancing a critical number of diverse CCUS demonstration \nprojects over the short- to medium-term under the road map (para 2). The TA cluster approach \nprovides the flexibility to support emerging needs through the design of subprojects during the TA \nimplementation period. \n \nIV.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CLUSTER \n \nA.  Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n9.  The TA cluster is aligned with the following impact: innovative climate change mitigation \ntechnology of CCUS successfully demonstrated for further deployment in the PRC.10 The TA \ncluster  will  have  the  following  outcome:  implementation  of  at  least  one  large-scale  CCUS \n                                                \n8  CCUS constitutes an important part of the CCS technology suite and therefore is prioritized in the road map. \n9  As focus region for the demonstration of CCS and CCUS, the road map identified the Erdos Basin in the northern \nPRC covering Gansu, Ningxia, Shaanxi, and Shanxi provinces as well as the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. \n10 National Development and Reform Commission and the National Energy Administration. 2016.

The  plan  defines  CCUS  as  one of the  innovative \ntechnologies to be further advanced.  \n ", "3 \ndemonstration project enabled. The final investment decision for the first CCUS demonstration \nproject is expected to be taken within the 13th plan period.11 \n \n10.  Output 1: Enabling environment for CCUS demonstration strengthened. Output 1 will \nsupport the development of policies and regulations needed to create the right framework \nconditions for an accelerated deployment of CCUS demonstration projects locally and nationally. \n \n11.  Output 2: Capacity of CCUS project developers strengthened. The capacity of project \ndevelopers will be strengthened to enable them to effectively undertake critical analytical work \nneeded to design fully functional CCUS demonstration projects. This will be achieved through the \npreparation of knowledge products to disseminate key information as well as the design and \ndelivery of targeted training programs and study tours.  \n \n12.  Output  3:  Feasibility  assessments  completed  for  large-scale  CCUS  projects. \nOutput 3 will support project developers in undertaking project-specific technical, financial, and \neconomic  feasibility  assessments  within  the  coal  chemical  industry  and  coal-fired  power \nsubsector. Environmental, safety, risk, and social impact assessments will also be conducted for \nselected CCUS demonstration projects. \n \nB.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA cluster is estimated to cost $5,500,000 and will be financed on a grant basis by \nthe Carbon Capture and Storage Fund12 under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility \nand administered by ADB. Detailed cost estimates and financing arrangements will be presented \nin each TA subproject proposal submitted for approval. During TA implementation, additional \nfinancial resources will be mobilized to support additional subprojects as needed, once these \nhave been identified.  \n \n14.  For each TA subproject, the respective implementing agencies will provide counterpart \nsupport in the form of counterpart staff, office facilities, domestic transportation, provision of \nsubject-related government data and studies for the TA consultants\u2019 use, provision of meeting \nrooms, and other in-kind contributions.  \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  The ADB\u2019s East Asia Department Energy Division will administer the TA cluster. The \nNDRC Department of Climate Change will be the executing agency. Subproject 1 will support the \nNational and Local Joint Engineering Research Center for CCUS (NLJERC-CCUS) at Northwest \nUniversity in Shaanxi Province to develop a comprehensive commercialization strategy for the \naccelerated uptake of early-stage CCUS demonstration. In parallel, subproject 2 will directly \nsupport the CCUS demonstration project currently under development by Yanchang Petroleum \nGroup (YPG) in line with the road map (para. 2). For subproject 1, the NLJERC-CCUS will be the \nimplementing agency, while YPG will be the implementing agency for subproject 2. A steering \ncommittee  consisting  of  representatives  from  the  NDRC,  ADB,  the  National  Energy \nAdministration,  the  Ministry  of  Science  and  Technology,  and  Northwest  University  will  be \nresponsible for selecting potential additional subprojects.

Subprojects. The TA cluster will initially be implemented through two subprojects.13 Each \nsubproject will be designed to support the achievement of one or more of the TA cluster outputs \n(paras. 11\u201313). Additional subprojects will be considered during the TA implementation period, \nas and when needed, subject to the availability of additional financial resources, through a change \nin TA cluster scope and budget.  \n \nTable 2: Indicative Implementation Period and Budget Allocation for Subprojects \nBudget \nItem  Subproject Title  Implementation Period  ($\u2019000) \nSubproject 1  Capacity Development Support to the National  October 2017\u2013October 2020  1,200 \nand Local Joint Engineering Research Center \nfor Carbon Capture, Utilization, and \nSequestration at Northwest University  \nSubproject 2  Feasibility Assessment of a Large-Scale  October 2017- October 2020  4,300 \nCarbon Capture and Storage Demonstration \nProject and Development Support to \nYanchang Petroleum Group \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n17.  Consulting services. All national and international consultants will be engaged on output-\nbased contracts. Since CCUS is a nascent industry and extends from power to oil and gas, it is \noften extremely difficult to find consulting firms that can provide the full range of required expertise. \nTherefore,  consultants  for  TA  subprojects  will  be  engaged  using  the  individual  consultant \n                                                \n13 Subproject descriptions are included in Appendix 2. \n ", "5 \nselection method in accordance with the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time \nto time) and the associated project administration instructions and/or staff instructions.14  \n \n18.  ADB will (i) engage TA consultants and review their reports; (ii) ease the exchange of \ninformation and dialogue with executing and implementing agencies; and (iii) assist tripartite \nmeetings and TA workshops. ADB will also engage a project manager who will be responsible for \noverall TA cluster administration and management from ADB headquarters. In addition, two \nproject managers will be recruited under each subproject to (i) track and promote TA subproject \nimplementation; (ii) coordinate the work of individual TA subprojects; (iii) facilitate the exchange \nof information, dialogue, and discussions between executing agency, implementation agency, \nconsultants, and stakeholders; and (iv) assist the day-to-day management of the TA cluster. \n \n19.  To ensure that participating agencies benefit widely from TA outputs, the implementing \nagencies of TA subprojects will establish an effective coordination mechanism, i.e., a network \nwith key industrial partners, project developers, nongovernment organizations, local and national \ngovernment agencies, as well as central government ministries with low-carbon policy-making \nresponsibilities for the PRC. Experts will ensure that stakeholder organizations will be thoroughly \nconsulted on all TA outputs.15 ADB and the executing agency will organize and manage high-\nlevel roundtables, workshops, and seminars to share information and discuss interim results.  \n \nV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) administering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of \n$5,500,000 to the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China to be financed on a grant basis \nby the Carbon Capture and Storage Fund under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility \nfor Promoting and Scaling Up Carbon Capture and Storage Demonstration, and hereby reports \nthis action to the Board. \n \n                                                \n14 Output-based contracts will be considered for consulting services under the TA in line with ADB. 2014.
