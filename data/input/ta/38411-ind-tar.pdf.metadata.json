The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  India  Country  Strategy  and  Program  Update \n(CSPU) (2005-2007), approved by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors on 28 September 2004, included \nsupport  for  irrigated  agriculture  development.  Following  consultations,  the  Orissa  state \ngovernment (OSG) and the Government of India (the Government) confirmed a request for \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  to  prepare  the  Orissa  Integrated  Irrigated  Agriculture  and  Water \nManagement Project. The Fact-Finding Mission was undertaken in December 2005 to prepare \nthe TA project. The Mission held discussions with the representatives of the Government, OSG, \nand a cross section of stakeholders to reach an understanding on the objectives, scope, costs, \nand implementation arrangements of the TA.1 The TA design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1.  \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  National Agriculture, Irrigation, and Rural Sectors. India has seen rapid economic \ngrowth over the past decade and had achieved a per capita income of $560 by FY2003. \nHowever, many people remain poor: some 390 million people were living on less than $1 a day \nin 2000, most of them in rural areas. Agriculture growth has slowed recently, despite the fact \nthat major crop yields are still lower than those of other developing countries.2 The Government \nannounced a \u201cCommon Minimum Programme\u201d in 2004, stressing its resolve to achieve more \nbroad-based and inclusive growth. High priority has been accorded to pro-poor growth in rural \nareas, through aggressive investments in agriculture, rural infrastructure, and irrigation.   \n3.  Irrigation is essential for agriculture throughout the year in most of India, with 40% of the \nnet cultivated area of 142 million hectares (ha) having irrigation access. It has become the major \nissue for the water sector, as irrigation represents 84% of total water use and more will be \nneeded to meet growing food demands. At the same time, per capita water availability is rapidly \ndeclining with increasing water stress in many river basins. These have prompted calls for more \nstorage  and  better  water  management.  However,  the  subsector  is  facing  fundamental \nchallenges. There is a huge portfolio of unfinished new irrigation schemes (requiring additional \n$20 billion to create 14 million ha of land under irrigation), most of which suffer from large time \nand cost overruns. Moreover, many completed schemes are underused (at least 14 million ha \nremain unutilized) because of insufficient operation and maintenance (O&M). State irrigation \nagencies are also unable to deliver services with adequate farmer participation.  \n4.  The Government revised the National Water Policy (NWP)3 in 2002 to address these \nchallenges, promoting state-level policy and institutional reforms to (i) manage water efficiently \nwith integrated water resources management (IWRM), (ii) pursue higher system utilization and \nsustainable O&M with participatory irrigation management (PIM), and (iii) reorganize irrigation \ndepartments to effectively carry out these measures. While several states have begun reforms \nto implement IWRM and PIM, the process is still at an initial stage in the country as a whole.  \n5.  Rural Economy and Agriculture in Orissa. Orissa remains one of the poorest states in \nIndia, with a per capita income of $220 in FY2003. About 47% of the population was poor in \n2000.  Most  of  the  poor  live  in  rural  areas.  Agriculture  is  the  backbone  of  the  economy, \naccounting for some 30% of the state domestic product and employing over 60% of the total \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 28 May 2005 as Integrated Irrigation Development \nProject. The ensuing loan is included in ADB\u2019s lending program for 2007 in the CSPU (2006\u20132008): India.  \n2  The annual growth rate was 3.2% from FY1981 to FY1996, 1.9% up to FY2002, and 0.9% in FY2003\u20132004 \n(against a target of 4%). The average rice yield is half that in Indonesia and Viet Nam.  \n3  Government of India, Ministry of Water Resources. 2002. National Water Policy. New Delhi. \n ", "2   \nworkforce and 80% of the workforce in rural areas. Yet productivity remains low, with (i) low \ncropping intensity (130\u2013140%), (ii) low levels of irrigated land (about 30%) and other input use, \nand (iii) a predominance of paddy cropping (70% of cultivation), with yields much lower than the \nnational  average.  With  an  average  landholding  size  of  1.3  ha,  and  over  80%  of  holdings \noperated by small farmers, agriculture is largely based on traditional practices, although 10% of \nthe total cultivated area is also devoted to fruit and vegetable cultivation.  \n6.  To enhance agricultural productivity, a state agriculture policy was launched in 1996 to \nincrease  crop  intensity  and  diversity  through  better  water  management,  input  distribution, \nextension systems, and infrastructure. The state is now introducing a market act, which will (i) \npermit private investments in marketing and storage facilities, and (ii) provide a framework for \ncontract farming. Although there are still key bottlenecks in public seed and fertilizer supply and \nextension  systems,  sporadic  development  with  significant  paddy  and/or  high-value  crop \nintensification can be seen in many places, particularly where irrigation is assured with good \nconnections to the market. Concerted efforts are needed to (i) identify suitable area-specific \nfarming systems by analyzing local production and marketing conditions and farmer incentives, \n(ii)  set  realistic  output  targets,  and  (iii) define  programs  to  address  local  constraints  while \nmeeting the specific needs of the poor. Innovative methods that have been effective in India \nshould be pursued, including the use of private providers of agricultural services and inputs.  \n7.  Status  of  Irrigation  and  Water  Resources.  Orissa  has  relatively  abundant  water \nresources. Yet irrigation is an essential input for agriculture throughout the year, as 80% of the \nannual rainfall occurs erratically during the June\u2013September period. Its net sown area is 6.0 \nmillion ha, and 2.7 million ha of net irrigation potential has been created through ongoing and \ncompleted projects.4 However, the area with assured irrigation remains only about 1.7 million ha \nbecause  of  (i)  ineffective  water  distribution  with  lack  of  field  channels,  (ii) chronic  system \ndeterioration due to insufficient O&M, and (iii) lack of farmer participation to support O&M, \ncausing hardship and poverty in tail reach areas of canal systems. Following the NWP, the OSG \nis now according high priority to restoring and sustaining created irrigation potential at higher \nproductivity, since this will be cheaper and quicker than creating new irrigation potential.  \n8.  Policy and Institutional Environment. Since the late 1990s, OSG has progressively \nimproved the policy and institutional environment. Supported by externally funded programs,5 \n(i) a draft state water policy (SWP) and a state water plan have been prepared, following the \nNWP and adopting key principles of PIM and IWRM; (ii) legislation has put in place a water user \nassociation  (WUA)  framework  to  implement  PIM;  (iii)  a  principle  of  full  O&M  financing  by \nbeneficiaries has been adopted; and (iv) steps towards establishing institutions and functions for \nIWRM have been initiated on the basis of river basins. The Department of Water Resources \n(DOWR)  has  been  reorganized  and  its  management  strengthened.  Nevertheless,  the \nimplementation of the reforms is at an early stage, and will require close support to transform \nthese initiatives into sound sector operations.  \n9.  Irrigation  Service  Delivery.  The  state  has  begun  management  transfer  of  minor \nirrigation canals to WUAs and joint management of other facilities, with (i) WUA formation and \ntraining, (ii) a sixfold increase in the irrigation service charge (ISC), and (iii) the introduction of \ngrant provisions to WUAs to support O&M of the transferred canals. While WUAs now cover \n                                                 \n4  Comprising 1.24 million ha in major (more than 20,000 ha of irrigation command area) and medium (2,000\u201320,000 \nha) schemes, 0.88 million ha in minor (less than 2,000 ha) schemes, and 0.57 million ha in other areas. \n5  Including the Orissa Water Resources Consolidation Project, funded by the World Bank for $290 million in 1996\u2013\n2002, which covered irrigation scheme rehabilitation with PIM, and institutional strengthening for IWRM. Irrigation \nrehabilitation followed a sector project approach. The project was rated successful in its completion report.    \n ", "  3\n1 million ha of irrigated area, progress has been affected by their inability to perform O&M work, \nand by the poor infrastructure of many irrigation systems. Provider\u2013recipient relations between \nDOWR and WUAs are yet to be well developed to support accountable service delivery and \nO&M cost recovery. There is a vicious cycle of modest irrigation performance, limited ISC \ncollection, and insufficient maintenance funding, leading to further facility deterioration and lower \nirrigation performance.6 This needs to be transformed to a self-sustaining management cycle \nthrough effectively sequenced WUA strengthening and facility renovation of individual schemes.   \n10.  In DOWR, there is significant support for PIM and good analytical capacities to plan and \ndesign  irrigation  projects.  However,  DOWR  still  remains  an  engineering  agency  with  high \nestablishment costs and an aging staff structure. It needs to become a genuine service-oriented \nagency  capable  of  delivering  accountable  services  to  farmers,  with  a  smaller  setup  and \nenhanced multi-disciplinary management skills. Support systems for PIM need strengthening \nwith effective arrangements for establishing viable WUAs and promoting productive agriculture \nsystems.7 Sound management information systems (MIS) is also needed to monitor, plan, and \nimplement O&M to ensure sustainability.8 These are required to fully operationalize OSG\u2019s well-\nintended initiatives for PIM with significant WUA empowerment.  \n11.  IWRM. In recognition of increasing competition for water, the draft SWP proposes IWRM \non the basis of river basins. OSG is also contemplating establishing river basin organizations \nunder the Water Resources Board (WRB), an existing sector apex body chaired by the chief \nsecretary. These reforms need to be advanced while operationalizing specific IWRM functions, \nsuch as (i) participatory and holistic basin planning incorporating water investments, watersheds, \nagriculture, and other support services; (ii) the introduction of regulatory functions for water use \nand quality management; and (iii) database and its management for sound monitoring.     \n12.  Opportunities  for  ADB  Support.  Against this backdrop, OSG has requested ADB \nsupport for irrigated agriculture development, focusing on enhancing productivity and assuring \nthe sustainability of existing, weakly-performing irrigation schemes, including traditional tanks \nand lift irrigation, in selected river basins.9 This is expected to be the first phase of a long-term \npartnership. To this end, an intervention package needs to be prepared that is ready for prompt \nimplementation. This package needs to generate high returns and revenues commensurate with \nADB\u2019s  lending  terms,  while  strengthening  and  operationalizing  the  policy  and  institutional \nframework for PIM and IWRM. The TA will support this process by assessing the most effective \nway of addressing the aforementioned issues. It is also consistent with ADB\u2019s water policy.  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The overall impact of the TA will be the increased rural incomes and reduced poverty in \nselected river basins in Orissa10 with improved irrigated agriculture development planning and \nprogram delivery systems. The TA outcome will be a project design agreed by OSG, the \n                                                 \n6  ISC is collected by district collectors as state revenue, and there is no link between the amount collected and that \nprovided to WUAs as an O&M grant at present. This is a constraint on enhancing ISC collection performance.  \n7  Vast opportunities exist to expand irrigation through coordinated crop planning by WUAs, including rotational \nplanting of high-value crops that use less water. WUAs may also be trained as local agriculture agents to liaise with \nlocal input and service providers and markets and to use collective bargaining power.  \n8  An alternative institutional modality under public\u2013private partnerships may also be explored. \n9  Including the four river basins north of the Mahanadi river basin, and the Mahanadi delta irrigation systems. DOWR \nis preparing detailed project reports, including feasibility studies for the requested schemes.  \n10  In addition to proposed basins in footnote 9, the possibilities for including other basins, such as southern basins of \nthe states suffering from high poverty and frequent droughts, will also be explored during the TA.  \n ", "4   \nGovernment, and ADB that will (i) enhance productivity and sustainability of existing irrigation \nsystems  with  increased  state  revenues;  and  (ii)  strengthen  institutions  including  DOWR \ndelivering accountable irrigation services, WUAs fulfilling specified O&M tasks, other agencies \nproviding sound support services, and a WRB and RBOs carrying out IWRM functions.  \n14.  In view of the OSG\u2019s progressively developing policy and institutional basis including \nSWP, state water plan, and DOWR capacities, a sector loan modality will be adopted for the \nensuing  project.11 This  TA  will  have  three  specific  outputs:  (i) a  basin  irrigated  agriculture \ninvestment strategy and plans; (ii) an investment package, including implementation guidelines \nand appraised subproject proposals that meet safeguard and other requirements; and (iii) an \ninstitutional development strategy and actions for PIM and IWRM, with a program of capacity \nbuilding and project management.  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n15.  The TA outputs will utilize (i) detailed project reports (DPRs) prepared by DOWR that \ninclude feasibility studies of proposed subprojects; (ii) existing policy, planning, and institutional \ndocuments; and (iii) other information on the sector. Building on these, the TA will carefully \nanalyze local conditions while applying lessons and best practices learned in India and other \ncountries.  A  consultative  approach  will  be  taken,  including  focus  group  meetings  with \nrepresentatives of poor communities. The policy and institutional framework will be harmonized \nwith other state programs. Activities will be divided into three phases. \n16.  Phase 1\u2500Strategic Framework Studies (1.5 months). During this phase, the TA will \nconduct sector and institutional studies to define a strategic framework to formulate the ensuing \nproject. The TA will assess and define (i) an irrigated agriculture development strategy, with \nupdated irrigation scheme inventories; (ii) action agendas for institutional development, defined \nby applying a diagnostic analysis of public agencies;12 (iii) a preliminary social development \nstrategy  and  safeguard  assessment  frameworks  (including  environment,  resettlement,  and \nindigenous peoples); and (iv) a project implementation framework (subproject selection criteria \nand implementation arrangements). An initial poverty and social analysis is in Appendix 2. \n17.  Phase 2\u2500Subproject Proposals and Institutional Actions (4 months). There will be \ntwo parallel activities. First, the TA will prepare detailed subproject proposals, building on the \nDPRs prepared by DOWR. Covering at least four major, six medium, and six minor schemes, \nthe DPRs will be expanded through baseline surveys; stakeholder consultations; supplementary \nplanning to define clear output targets and specific programs for irrigation, agriculture, and \nassociated  services  in  accordance  with  the  holistic  strategy  defined  in  phase  1;  feasibility \nanalysis; and safeguard plans. Second, the TA will prepare and recommend, through detailed \ninstitutional studies, immediate reforms and medium-term institutional action plans. \n18.  Phase 3\u2500Project Package (2 months). This phase will prepare and finalize the draft TA \noutputs specified above (para. 14). Among these, the basin investment plan will be based on \nscheme inventories and resource assessments. The investment package will set out component \ndesigns, and the implementation sequence and arrangements, including the establishment of a \nMIS with clear process and output targets for irrigated agriculture development. An institutional \n                                                 \n11  Its preliminary scope include (i) participatory subproject planning and WUA formation; (ii) improvement of irrigation \n(including field channels) and associated infrastructure (such as drainage); (iii) support services for (a) agriculture \nand fishery development, (b) livelihood enhancement for the poor, and (c) watershed management of reservoirs \nand tanks; (iv) sustainable O&M; and (v) institutional strengthening (for PIM and IWRM) and project management. \n12 Including (i) O&M financial sustainability; (ii) DOWR\u2019s resources, management infrastructure, and vision and \nstrategy; (iii) a WUA framework; (iv) private sector involvement; and (v) institutions for IWRM, among others.   \n ", "  5\nsupport program will be designed to fill in capacity and resource gaps through training and \noutsourcing to ensure high-quality implementation, while pursuing the institutional actions.13     \nC.  Cost and Financing \n19.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $875,000 equivalent. The TA will be cofinanced \non a grant basis by the Government of the United Kingdom for $590,000 equivalent and by the \nCooperation  Fund  for  the  Water  Sector  for  $110,000  equivalent,  both  of  which  will  be \nadministered by ADB. OSG will finance the remaining $175,000 equivalent through provision of \noffice space; counterpart staff; data and analysis, including DPRs; and other administrative \ncosts. Details of the cost estimates and financing are in Appendix 3. The Government has been \ninformed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project.   \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  DOWR will be the Executing Agency of the TA. It will appoint a TA director at the level of \nchief  engineer.  DOWR  will  also  form  (i)  a  project  preparatory  working  group  including  (a) \nspecialists in irrigation, drainage and flood control, hydrology, PIM, water resources planning, \nand  MIS  nominated  by  DOWR,  and  (b)  specialists  in  agriculture,  horticulture,  fisheries, \nwatershed, soil conservation, and forestry nominated by the departments concerned; (ii) an \ninterdepartmental  TA  steering  committee  chaired  by  the  secretary  of  DOWR;  and  (iii)  an \nadvisory group of renowned sector specialists, to implement and guide the TA activities. At the \noutset, DOWR will provide (i) the DPRs for the proposed subprojects to be studied in detail \nunder the TA; (ii) irrigation scheme inventories for the river basins; and (iii) other available \nmaterials related to the sector and its policy and institutional framework.  \n21.  The TA will be implemented for 7.5 months from August 2006 to April 2007. It will require \n8.5 person-months of international and 39 person-months of domestic consultants covering \nirrigation planning and management, irrigation institutions, PIM, IWRM, agronomy, agriculture \neconomics,  sociology,  environment,  and  resettlement,  along  with  studies,  surveys,  and \nconsultations. Outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 4. The consultants will \nbe engaged by ADB on an individual basis according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants, and other arrangements acceptable to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. \nThe consultants will submit an inception report within 2 weeks, interim reports for phase 1 within \n1.5 months and for phase 2 within 5.5 months, and a draft final report within 6.5 months of the \nstart of the TA. Tripartite meetings with OSG, ADB, and the consultants will be held to discuss \nthese reports, along with workshops with stakeholders. A final report will be submitted within 2 \nweeks after the Government, OSG, and ADB comment on the draft final report.    \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering  (i)  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $590,000  to  the \nGovernment of India to be financed on a grant basis by the Government of the United Kingdom, \nand (ii) technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $110,000 to the Government of \nIndia  to  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Cooperation  Fund  for  the  Water  Sector  for \npreparing  the  Orissa  Integrated  Irrigated  Agriculture  and  Water  Management  Project,  and \nhereby reports this action to the Board.  \n                                                 \n13 A work plan for conducting (i) further subproject planning, (ii) preconstruction works, and (iii) training prior to loan \nsigning will also be prepared, to support OSG through a separate TA facility included in CSPU (2006\u20132008): India. \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData Sources/ Reporting  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Performance Targets/Indicators \nMechanisms  Risks \nImpact      Assumptions  \nEnhanced economic growth  \u2022 Incomes: Incremental farm  \u2022  National and district  \u2022  The Orissa state \nand reduced poverty in rural  household incomes (to be  statistics on agriculture,  government (OSG) \nareas of selected river basins  quantified during the TA)  incomes, and human  will accept loan \nin Orissa, together with  \u2022 Poverty: Incremental poverty  development index  terms and conditions \nincreased state revenues  reduction in rural households in  \u2022  Budget monitoring and  offered by the \n(brought about through a  subproject areas   evaluation (BME) reports  Government of India \nproject prepared under this  \u2022 Food security: Incremental food  \u2022  Other appropriate  for the follow-on \ntechnical assistance [TA])  self sufficiency among farmers   statistics including those  investment project. \n  \u2022 State total revenue: Incremental  related to the improved  \u2022  Ensuing loan project \n \nrevenue from land, crop sales,  management information  is feasibly designed, \nand irrigation levies   system (MIS) system of  funded, and \n\u2022 Institutions: Similar interventions  the Department of Water  implemented. \n \nare replicated, accelerating  Resources (DOWR)    \nagriculture growth   \nOutcome      Assumptions \nAn investment project design  Specific results to be defined at  \u2022  BME reports  \u2022  Project institutions \nagreed by the borrower and  project and subproject levels, with  \u2022  National statistics  are willing to \nAsian Development Bank  individual subproject targets fixed  \u2022  Project MIS comprising  promote \n(ADB) to achieve enhanced  in DPRs, and monitored:  baseline, targets, process  participatory \nproductivity and sustainability  (i)  cropping intensity increased,  and management, and  irrigation \nof existing irrigation systems  and irrigated area extended  impacts   management (PIM) \nsuffering from low productivity  (ii)  increase in annual cereal and    and IWRM. \nand poverty in the selected  other crop production    \u2022  WUAs will \nriver basins, through  (iii) increase in gross margin per    strengthen their \ncomponents tentatively  farm family    institutional basis \ncomprising:  (iv) increase in permanent    while managing the \n(i)  Delivering services for (a)  employment, and annual family    facilities effectively. \ndetailed project report  income of landless laborers    \u2022  WUAs are willing to \n(DPR) preparation and  (v)  increase in state revenue    adopt modern \nwater users association       cropping patterns.  \n(WUA) development;

No \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in India: \nIndia. Since the 1960s, agriculture improvement led by the Green Revolution has been the major contributor to \npoverty reduction in India. Irrigation is essential for agriculture throughout the year in most of the country. Nationwide, \n40% of net cultivated land has irrigation access. However, the utilization of water resources has remained uneven. \nIndia will reach a state of water crisis in 2025a and significant water scarcity is already being experienced in some \nregions. Although the economy is no longer predominantly  dependent on agriculture, about two thirds of the \npopulation living in rural areas depends on agriculture for its livelihood. Irrigated agriculture has become the prime \nengine of agricultural production. Although significant strides have been made in poverty reduction in both rural and \nurban areas, food grain surpluses co-exist with chronic poverty in the form of entrenched poverty pockets in many \nstates. There is an urgent need to examine (i) intervention strategies, (ii) resource distribution, and (iii) inclusive and \nparticipatory development to sustain development efforts. \nAccording to the National Human Development Report,b the incidence of poverty declined from 44.5% in 1983 to \n26.1% in 1999\u20132000. The report highlighted the marked differences in poverty incidence within the country. Poverty \nreduction is a joint responsibility of the central and the state governments and programs fall into four main groups: \n(i) group-oriented poverty programs, (ii) area development programs, (iii) infrastructure development, and (iv) public \ndistribution. Landless laborers will not benefit directly from public irrigation interventions. Rather, they will benefit \nindirectly through increases in demand for their services as agricultural wage laborers.  \n  \nOrissa State. Orissa is one of the poorest states of India. Its per capita income was $220 in FY2003 and about 47% \nof the population lives below the poverty line. Although there has been a steady decline in poverty incidence, it \nremained stagnant in the second half of the 1990s. This may be related to the poor performance of the agriculture \nsector, but it also reflects regional trends within the state, as poverty has increased in northern and southern Orissa. \nSince almost 75% of the state\u2019s poor live in these regions, this has influenced the overall poverty ratio. Poverty is \noverwhelmingly a rural phenomenon. The rural poverty ratio in the southern region is more than two and a half times \nthat of the coastal region and in the northern region it is more than one and a half times that of the coastal region. This \npartly reflects the incidence of poverty among scheduled tribes and castes, which are concentrated in these regions.  \nOrissa is predominantly an agrarian economy and agriculture contributes 30% of the state domestic product. Although \nthis share declined in the 1990s, the percentage of the workforce engaged in agriculture remained unchanged. The \nratio of agricultural wage laborers to owners/cultivators has increased substantially because of an increase in \nlandlessness or near landlessness caused in turn by population growth and the subdivision of landholdings among \nlegal heirs. As the pace of industrialization is slow, agricultural growth is essential to the overall development of the \nstate as it (i) creates employment, (ii) generates income, (iii) provides raw materials for the industrial sector, and \n(iv) ensures food security. However, agricultural productivity remains low, with (i) low cropping intensity (130\u2013140%), \n(ii) a small amount of irrigated land (32% of gross cultivated area), and (iii) limited use of other agricultural inputs and a \npredominance of food grain cropping (85% of gross cultivated area). \nIrrigated agriculture has the potential to raise productivity and diversify agricultural practice. Underutilized irrigation \nschemes need to be expanded and rehabilitated. Poor management of water resources needs to be reduced by \nparticipatory irrigation management (PIM) and water user associations (WUAs). Modern agricultural technology needs \nto be applied and productivity raised through intercropping and diversification of agricultural produce (from mainly \npaddy cultivation to high-yield rice varieties), cash crops, and fisheries. This can provide additional income to farmers, \nmaking  them  less  vulnerable.  The  ensuing  project  will  adopt  irrigation  schemes  that  are  operated  mostly  by \nsmallholders with a poverty incidence significantly higher than the national average.   \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: Targeted Intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nParticipatory poverty analysis is required to analyze specific groups of the poor and disadvantaged sections of the \npopulation, such as scheduled tribes and scheduled castes, irrigation users, landless people, and sharecropping \ntenants in the project area and to develop specific strategies to meet their needs and priorities for enhancing \nlivelihoods.  \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  11 \nAnalysis of Vulnerability and Access to Livelihood Assets. Underlying the concept of sustainable livelihoods is the \nnotion that poverty is a multidimensional and impermanent condition. The challenge is to focus on the many aspects of \nfarm  households  and  to  analyze  their  poverty  characteristics.  The  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  provide  a \ncomprehensive picture of rural poverty in the project area, focusing on selected irrigation schemes, and formulating \noptions for enhancing and developing the asset base of the poor for income-generating activities, e.g., diversification \nof cropping patterns, fisheries, and upper watershed management. The livelihood strategy and activities will be \nreflected in the project synthesis with sample subproject proposals developed with active participation of stakeholders. \n \nDistribution Analysis and Poverty Impact Ratio Analysis. Poverty impact ratio and distribution analyses will \nassess the distribution of project benefits and show how the costs and benefits are shared among the poor and other \nstakeholders. They will also analyze how much of the net economic benefits will accrue to the poor. The feasibility \nstudy will identify (i) how the costs will be incurred and benefits realized, (ii) gains from the distribution of project \neffects, (iii) how the cost burden can be made acceptable to those who will pay, (iv) overall project performance and \nreturns on equity considerations, and (v) modifications of the project design and components to enhance the impact \non target beneficiaries. \n \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \nThe TA will carry out a stakeholder analysis through a participatory process with communities, public agencies, the \nprivate sector, and external financiers. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \nThe TA will prepare a stakeholder participation strategy with particular emphasis on PIM and the transfer of irrigation \nmanagement to WUA. However, this will not necessarily improve the situation of poor farmers. Research suggests \nthat  even  participatory  irrigation  management  transfer  processes  based  on  strong  voting  rights  for  farmers, \nirrespective of farm size, may not necessarily be pro-poor. Poor farmers are less informed about their rights and tend \nto have a smaller share of the potential benefits of management transfer. They participate more in repair and \nrehabilitation work, while the larger farmers are more involved in the decision-making process, dominating the \nmeetings and committees.c \nHence, pro-poor irrigation management transfer issues addressed by the participation strategy will have to take into \naccount (i) the need for a high level of  farmer participation in the WUA; (ii) the fact that poor and nonpoor farmers may \nnot be equally well informed about WUAs and may not participate equally in their activities; (iii) farm size can be a \nreliable proxy indicator of poverty; (iv) poor farmers rely more on canal waters and have less access to alternative \nsources (as they tend to have fewer pumps and wells). \nThe participation strategy will complement the WUA study and will assess the performance of WUAs in terms of their \nawareness, membership, roles and responsibilities in operation and maintenance (O&M) in particular, and the \nmanagement and capacities needed to meet those responsibilities. It will identify gaps and actions needed, including \nthe need to modifying the existing framework. \n \n \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nA strategy to maximize the impact of irrigated agriculture and water resources management on women will be \nprepared under the TA. Women play a significant role in irrigated agriculture, especially if they are targeted early. \nWomen are engaged in vegetable farming and sell their produce at local markets and consume it at home\u2014if \nadequate access to irrigated fields is provided this will increase their productivity. \nApart from specifically targeting women as project beneficiaries, their participation will be ensured throughout the \nproject cycle by mainstreaming gender. Women play an active role in both household affairs and in such activities as \nshifting cultivation (where men do the land clearing and women all other agricultural operations). In addition to this, \nthey often take up wage labor. In parts of Orissa, women from scheduled tribes and castes work night shifts in canal \nand tunnel excavation work for irrigation projects. Women may be paid less than men for equal work. \n \nHas an output been prepared?      Yes     No \nThis will be prepared during the TA. \n \n ", "12  Appendix 2 \nE.
