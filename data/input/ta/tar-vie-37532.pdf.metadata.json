In implementing policy reforms under the Second Financial Sector Program Loan (FSPL \nII) Subprogram I,1 the Government of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam (the Government) has \nshown strong commitment to carry the Program forward and proceed to FSPL II, subprograms II \nand III in 2004\u20132005. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) loan review mission fielded from 16 \nto  20  June  2003  confirmed  that  the Government  had  initiated  multiple  processes  to fulfill \nsubprogram II and III policy actions. However, because many reform measures proposed under \nFSPL II include concepts and frameworks new to Viet Nam, full implementation of the two \nsubprograms requires additional technical input. Accordingly, the Government requested follow-\non technical assistance (TA)2 to help complete policy actions proposed under FSPL II. In \nresponse to this request, a fact-finding mission3 from ADB was fielded to Hanoi from 10 to 12 \nSeptember 2003 to discuss and reach an understanding with the Government on the objective, \nscope, cost, and implementation arrangements for the proposed TA.4  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Financial intermediation, dominated by bank savings and loans, remains low in Viet \nNam.  It  is  unlikely  that  the  banking  sector  alone,  with  its  current  level  of  outreach  and \noperational efficiency, would be capable of supporting economic development and employment \ngeneration targets under the Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy.5 In an \neffort to enhance means of financial intermediation, the Government is undertaking financial and \noperational  restructuring  of  the  banking  sector  with  assistance  from  the  World  Bank  and \nInternational  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  under  a  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Facility  and  a \nPoverty Reduction Support Credit as of June 2001. To complement this process, FSPL II, \nbuilding on achievements of FSPL I, supports the Government's effort to develop alternative \nchannels of financial intermediation to bank savings and loans. A diversified financial system will \nhelp  Viet  Nam  realize  its  broad-based  economic  growth  and  socioeconomic  development \nobjectives, including poverty reduction. \n \n3.  The subsectors covered under FSPL II include money/capital markets, insurance, and \nleasing. The nonbanking sector and capital markets will provide long-term funds and investment \ncapital,  largely  lacking  in  Viet  Nam.  Development  of  these  subsectors  will  also  increase \ncompetition within the financial sector and thus pressure other financial institutions, banks in \nparticular, to improve their efficiency. Under FSPL II, financial infrastructure, such as accounting \nand auditing systems, a deposit insurance system, and an antimoney-laundering (AML) regime \nare also covered. FSPL II as a whole aims to broaden and better balance the financial system, \nthereby building resilience to unfavorable exogenous shocks. \n                                                \n1  On 20 November 2002, the Board of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved FSPL II, the cluster concept of \nthree subprograms for $75 million and Subprogram I for $50 million, which is to be released in two tranches of $20 \nmillion and $30 million. The program objective is to support the Government\u2019s efforts in building an enabling \nenvironment for developing alternative channels of market-based financial intermediation. FSPL II Subprogram I \nbecame effective on 23 May 2003 and the first tranche was released on 28 August 2003 upon compliance with all \nseven first-tranche release conditions.   \n2  ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Capacity Building for Nonbank Financial \nInstitutions and Capital Market. Manila (TA:4035-VIE). \n3  The  mission  comprised  S.  Hattori  (sr.  financial  sector  specialist)  supported  by  A.  Pio  (principal  programs \nofficer/VRM) and B. T. Nghia (financial sector economist/VRM) in the field. \n4  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 22 August 2003. \n5  A poverty partnership agreement was signed on 25 February 2002. Poverty incidence declined from 37% in 1998 \nto 29% in 2002. The Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy targets a reduction in poverty \nincidence by approximately 12 percentage points by 2010, with a medium-term economic growth rate of 7.5% per \nannum. \n ", "2  \n \n4.  Along with the extensive banking sector restructuring and other policy reforms supported \nby  IMF  and  World  Bank  programs,  the  Government  initiated  implementation  of  FSPL  II, \nSubprogram I. While there is strong commitment from the Government to complete all reform \nmeasures under FSPL II, many concepts and frameworks are new to Viet Nam. Both technical \ninput as well as targeted training to equip the Executing Agency and implementing agencies \n(IAs)  with  knowledge  and  skills  to  implement  the  reform  measures  are  indispensable  for \nsuccessfully completing FSPL II.  \n \n5.  Technical support and training from international experts provided under the first TA,2 \nhave been timely and effective in filling the technical gaps encountered. However, to sustain the \nmomentum for reforms and to cover areas in need of technical input not provided for under the \nfirst TA, particularly accounting/auditing and deposit insurance systems, additional assistance is \nnecessary.  Continued  support  is  needed  to  (i) finalize  the  negotiable  instruments  law  for \nsubmission to the National Assembly, (ii) establish the financial intelligence unit (FIU) as an \neffective  agency  under  the  Vietnamese  AML  regime,  (iii) draft  the  securities  law  for \ninterministerial consultation, (iv) strengthen the Vietnamese Accounting Association (VAA), and \n(v) enhance the legal framework of Deposit Insurance Corporation of Viet Nam (DIV).  \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n6.  The  primary  purpose  of  the  TA  is  to  assist  the  Government  in  undertaking  policy \nconditions proposed under FSPL II. Its scope therefore parallels FSPL II, covering principally \nthe nonbanking and money/capital markets sectors.6 While FSPL II is extensive, requiring a \nmultitude of policy reforms, the scope of the TA is selective and focuses on a number of policy \nconditions that have been assessed to require additional technical inputs and capacity-building \nactivities for successful implementation. Appendix 1 gives the technical assistance framework \nand Appendix 2 contains the summary initial poverty and social analysis. \n \n7.  In the money market, restrictive and fragmented regulations inconvenience sellers and \nbuyers  and  discourage  innovations.  To  integrate  the  legal  framework  of  different  types  of \nnegotiable instruments, the adoption of a negotiable instruments law  is essential. FSPL II \nsupports the Government's intention to adopt a comprehensive legal framework for a wide \nrange  of  negotiable  instruments  and  has  proposed  drafting  and  submitting  the  negotiable \ninstruments law as policy actions under FSPL II, subprograms II and III. With the assistance \nprovided under the first TA, the legal department of the State Bank of Viet Nam (SBV) initiated \nand completed the first draft of the negotiable instruments law. However, prior to the submission \nof the law to the National Assembly, a process of interministerial consultation and discussion \nmust be completed. This TA will support SBV in the process of interministerial consultation and \ndiscussion to ensure that the best practices incorporated in the current draft are maintained in \nthe draft adopted as law. Furthermore, through a workshop and a study tour, officials involved in \ndrafting  and  implementing  the  law  will  be  exposed  to  international  best  practices.  Such \nexposure  will  facilitate  discussions  in  the  law-making  process  as  well  as  in  its  effective \nimplementation, once the law is enacted. \n                                                \n \n6  The detailed discussion of the background and rationale of each component can be found in ADB. 2002. Report \nand Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the Socialist Republic of \nViet Nam for the Second Financial Sector Program Loan. Manila. ", "    3\n \n8.  The first TA helped the Government in initiating the process for establishing an AML \nregime to fight against criminal activities. The TA inputs included (i) drafting a decree on AML \nand (ii) formulating a plan for establishing an FIU in Viet Nam. With the technical inputs from the \nfirst TA, the Inspectorate Division of SBV initiated and completed the draft decree on AML and \nheld interministerial discussions in August 2003. The decree will be submitted to the standing \ncommittee of the National Assembly and, upon receiving its endorsement, it will be signed by \nthe Prime Minister for issuance by end-2003. Once it is issued, establishing and operationalizing \nthe FIU will be the critical next step. This TA proposes to support SBV in establishing and \noperationalizing the FIU with provision of technical inputs and a study tour to see first hand the \nactual functions of the FIU.  \n \n9.  The State Securities Commission (SSC) submitted to the Government a long-term plan \nfor capital market development, which was subsequently approved and issued by the Prime \nMinister in August 2003. While not in the original proposal for policy actions under FSPL II, the \nSSC recognizes the limitations of operating the securities market by decree and wishes to draft \na comprehensive securities law for submission to the National Assembly by 2005. The drafting \nof such a law was originally envisaged for 2007\u20132009 under the capital market development \nroadmap.7 However, there is much merit in strengthening the current legal framework sooner \nand such an initiative by SSC should be supported. The follow-on TA proposes to support SSC \nin  drafting  a  comprehensive  securities  law  for  Viet  Nam  and  to  facilitate  interministerial \ndiscussions for finalizing the draft law for submission to the National Assembly.  \n \n10.  The first TA did not provide assistance for the accounting/auditing and deposit insurance \ncomponents of FSPL II. The Accounting and Policy Department of the Ministry of Finance \n(MOF) drafted the Vietnamese Accounting Law, which was endorsed and issued by the National \nAssembly in 2003. The Vietnamese accounting standards, which are being developed based on \ninternational accounting standards and with consideration of Viet Nam's specific conditions, are \nplanned for completion by end-2004. In tandem with the legal and regulatory framework for \naccounting/auditing being established, there is much work to be done in upgrading the quality of \nindustry professionals. FSPL II proposes to strengthen the VAA for this purpose.  \n \n11.  VAA was founded in 1994 and became a member of the International Federation of \nAccountants and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Federation of Accountants in \n1998. However, its capacity remains low and its role in the industry is limited. The TA proposes \nto work with MOF and VAA to formulate an action plan for strengthening the capacity of VAA as \nwell as to provide VAA with the legal basis to act as a self-regulatory organization for the \naccounting and auditing industry. \n \n12.  Similarly, DIV requires substantial capacity building to effectively function as a safety net \nfor depositors and contribute to the stability of the financial sector as originally planned. The TA \nwill assist SBV and DIV in enhancing the legal basis for DIV to act as an independent agency \nand preclude the moral hazard integral to the deposit insurance system. Also, the TA will \nprovide technical input to make the deposit insurance system financially sustainable by setting \ndifferent premiums in accordance with the type of financial institution and by drafting an action \nplan for people\u2019s credit funds to establish their own safety funds. \n                                                \n7  The Capital Market Development Roadmap, which provided the technical inputs for drafting the Government's \nlong-term plan for capital market development, was prepared in October 2002 under ADB. 1999. Technical \nAssistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Corporatization and Corporate Governance.  Manila. (TA \n3353-VIE) \n ", "4  \n \n13.  The  operational  environment  of two  subsectors  under  FSPL II\u2014money  market  and \nleasing\u2014is being improved. However, there are some pending technical issues, such as the \nimprovement of the banking sector's treasury functions as well as modifications in the rules and \nregulations  governing  the  leasing  sector.  The  TA  will  support  roundtable  discussions  with \ngovernment  officials  and  stakeholders  concerned  and  invite  international  experts  to  share \ninternational best practices to facilitate discussions.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The TA will fund consultants with expertise in building an effective legal and regulatory \nsystem for the nonbanking sector and financial infrastructure. The consultants will conduct in-\ndepth consultation with the Government and private sector stakeholders to ensure that the \nproposed legal and regulatory frameworks are practical within the Vietnamese economic and \noperational environment. Consultation will be a key part of the process in producing outputs, \nand will be followed by a number of roundtable discussions and workshops for transferring \nknowledge and skills needed for implementing policy conditions under FSPL II, subprograms II \nand III. ADB will closely monitor the process to ensure quality of outputs produced and training \noffered. \n \n15.  The proposed TA will also fund study tours in preparation for actual implementation of \nthe negotiable instruments law and the AML regime. The first study tour is for the officials \ninvolved in drafting and implementing the negotiable instruments law to learn best practices in \nthe use and management of the law. The second study tour is for the appointed FIU officials to \nlearn the procedural requirements of an effective FIU operation. The consultants engaged for \nthe negotiable instruments law and the AML will be responsible for making all the necessary \narrangements for the study tours. For all study tours, the participants will be required to submit \nto the consultants and ADB a report of the study tour no later than 3 weeks after their return, \nciting the relevance of the study tour to their work.  \n \n16.  The roundtable discussions and study tours will be designed to support implementation \nof specific policy actions under FSPL II and thus must be pragmatic and suitable to the current \nsituation in Viet Nam. The government officials concerned, the consultants, and ADB will ensure \nthat issues identified during the roundtable discussions and findings of the study tours are fully \naddressed and incorporated in the draft law, rules, and regulations prepared under the TA. \n \n17.  The proposed TA will also support roundtable discussions for the money market and \nleasing subsectors. Participants will include government officials and stakeholders concerned \nand discussions will be led by international experts in the area invited to share international best \npractices and facilitate consensus building.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost a total of $980,000 equivalent, including a foreign exchange \ncost  of  $655,850  and  a  local  currency  cost  of  $324,150  equivalent.  A  total  of  $780,000 \nequivalent\u2014the total foreign exchange cost and $124,150 equivalent of local currency cost\u2014will \nbe financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. \nThe Government will contribute $200,000 equivalent in kind for office space, counterpart staff, \nand other miscellaneous services. Details of the cost estimates are in Appendix 3. \n ", "    5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  SBV will be the Executing Agency for the TA; and SBV, MOF, DIV, and SSC will be the \nIAs. In addition to office space, the IAs will provide counterpart staff and other support services \nto  the  consultants.  The  program  steering  committee,8  which  was  formed  under  FSPL  II, \nSubprogram I, will oversee TA implementation. SBV  will appoint a project director for the \npurposes of assisting in daily TA implementation. \n \n20.  The TA will require 14 person-months of international and 9 person-months of domestic \nconsultant inputs. The terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 4. The TA will be \ncontracted to an international consulting firm. Short-listed firms will submit simplified technical \nproposals. All the consultants will be selected in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic \nconsultants. \n \n21.  Study tours will be organized by the consultants to build the capacity of the officials \nconcerned in drafting and managing the negotiable instruments law and in establishing the \nfinancial intelligence unit for the Vietnamese antimoney-laundering regime. The countries for the \nstudy tours and visits to institutions will be carefully selected considering their relevance to the \neconomic, financial, and legal status of Viet Nam.  \n \n22.  The consultants will prepare detailed work plans before the start of services, which will \ninclude a timetable for deliverables defined under each component of the TA in consultation with \nthe IAs. The consultants engaged are required to submit an inception report after 2 weeks of \nstarting the Project. Interim reports will be submitted 8 weeks after the submission of the \ninception report. The interim reports will be reviewed by SBV, the IAs, and ADB. Draft final \nreports will be submitted within the deadline specified in the work plans after incorporating \nfeedback from SBV, the IAs, and ADB. Tripartite meetings will be held before finalizing the draft \nfinal reports. The final reports, incorporating comments of SBV, the IAs, and ADB during and \nafter the tripartite meetings, will be submitted upon completion of service. The TA is expected to \nbe implemented over a period of 12 months and is scheduled to commence in May 2004 and to \nbe completed by May 2005. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $780,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Viet Nam for Capacity Building for the Financial Sector and Capital Markets, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n \n                                                \n8  The program steering committee comprises senior officers from the State Bank of Viet Nam, Ministry of Finance, \nMinistry of Planning and Investment, Ministry of Justice, State Securities Commission, and the Deposit Insurance \nCorporation of Viet Nam.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nSector identified as a national      Yes  Sector identified as a national    Yes   \npriority in country poverty analysis?  priority in country poverty  \n  partnership agreement? \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Viet Nam: \n \nEfficiency, resiliency, and diversity of the financial sector contribute to poverty reduction in Viet Nam \non the macro, micro, and individual levels. \n \nFirst, the financial sector supports economic growth through mobilizing resources (savings and other \nmeans of investments, domestically and internationally). In Viet Nam, in addition to existing banks, \nother financial intermediaries such as insurance and leasing as well as capital markets are still in the \nprimary stage of development. Under the Second Financial Sector Program Loan (FSPL II), the \ndevelopment of these subsectors will help to mobilize domestic resources, long-term funding in \nparticular. The Government estimates that for 2001\u20132005, approximately $60 billion will need to be \nmobilized for development investment, particularly infrastructure. This target can only be achieved by \na well-functioning and diversified financial sector.  \nSecond, the financial sector also functions as a channel for allocating resources to the real sector. \nCurrently, many segments of the economy including the private sector and especially small and \nmedium enterprises (SMEs) have difficulties in accessing credit and other financial services. This is \nbecause of high costs, lack of regional outreach, and limited understanding of alternative sources of \nfunding. Under FSPL II, these constraints will be addressed. Moreover, the development of the real \nsectors,  including  the  private  sector,  especially  SMEs,  benefits  from  higher  accessibility  and \ndiversification of financial products and services. Real sector development creates employment \nopportunities, and enables the poor and vulnerable to obtain the critical means of lifting themselves \nout of poverty.  \nA sound and efficient financial system provides accessible, high-quality, and well-diversified financial \nservices for both the poor and nonpoor.
