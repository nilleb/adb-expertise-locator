The strategy covers five main areas of intervention to mitigate \nrisk and vulnerability, namely: social insurance, social assistance, labor market programs, local \nand area-based schemes, and child protection. A regional social protection assessment study \nwas included in the Pacific Regional Assistance Program in 2002. Fact-finding missions were \nfielded to Papua New Guinea (PNG) in January 2003, to Vanuatu in February 2003, and to the \nMarshall Islands (RMI) in April 2003. The missions discussed with the governments the concept, \napproach, and outline of the study. The Government of Vanuatu concurred with the goals, \npurpose, scope, implementation arrangementments, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of \nreference of the study. Concurrence from the governments of PNG and RMI is being sought, \nand other countries will be invited to participate as appropriate. No project activities will be \nundertaken in any country until the concurrence of the particular government is received. The \ntechnical assistance (TA)1 framework is shown in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Pacific economies face some long-standing problems, including weak or no employment \ngrowth, poverty, low levels of private investment, low return on public investments, insecurity of \nland tenure, and low commodity prices. A general economic slowdown, a decline in international \ntrade, decreased international tourism, and the migration of skilled workers are common across \nthe region. The region is also susceptible to natural disasters, which bring economic shocks to \nalready  vulnerable  communities.  While  their  economies  remain  stagnant,  some  Pacific \ndeveloping member countries (PDMCs) depend largely on international aid and remittances \nfrom abroad. \n \n3.  Although  individual  PDMCs\u2019  circumstances  and  performance  vary  significantly,  the \noverall  picture  is  not  encouraging.  The  Pacific  is  falling  behind  other  developing  regions. \nEconomic growth has not kept pace with high population growth rates, so per capita incomes \nare declining, sometimes steeply. Even where per capita incomes have grown, the extent of \ngrowth is insufficient to promote real development. The private sector has been unable to lead \neconomic growth, job creation for young people has been minimal, and poverty is becoming a \nsignificant issue in many PDMCs. Previously mitigated by social safety nets in rural villages, \ntoday poverty most often manifests itself as hardship in meeting basic needs rather than in \nabsolute or food poverty. It lurks in unplanned and un-serviced peri-urban settlements filled with \nmigrants seeking nonexistent jobs and among those populations left behind on outer islands. \nWhile data are not definitive, more than 25% of the population of Fiji Islands, Kiribati, Federated \nStates of Micronesia, PNG, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, and Vanuatu are believed to be \nliving in poverty. \n \n4.  Social indicators are also showing very mixed performance. Some PDMCs are slipping \ndown the country rankings of the human development index,and many will fail to achieve key \n \ntargets of the Millennium Development Goalsby 2015. Crime and ethnic tensions are growing in \n \nmany areas, and the rule of law has come under pressure in some PDMCs. \n \n5.  Two priorities emerge consistently from surveys of the poor across eight PDMCs: (i) \naccess to cash income-generating opportunities, and (ii) access to social services, especially \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 20 January 2003. ", "2 \nprimary education and health care. ADB is proposing that these two priorities guide its new \nPacific strategy. The key to generating cash income is enabling the poor to gain access to \nefficient markets for goods and services and to secure decent jobs. As PDMC governments \nrecognize,  the  private  sector  must  drive  market  and  job  creation.  The  range  of  good \ngovernance, policy, and institutional issues is vital to the creation of a supportive environment \nfor  private  sector  development.  Public  goods  such  as  macroeconomic  stability,  physical \nsecurity, and adherence to the rule of law are essential prerequisites. These in turn require a \ndegree of political stability.  \n \n6.  Social protection policy interventions can alleviate hardship caused by sharp drops in \nincome or consumption among those in the most vulnerable groups, and can mitigate the \nconsequent  erosion  of  human  capital  investment.  Social  protection  mechanisms  can  spur \ngrowth  insofar  as  the poor  can  afford  to  undertake  riskier  activities  with  higher  returns  in \nproduction and the labor market. They can also encourage pro-growth reforms and liberalization \nprograms. \n \n7.  Social protection in Marshall Islands, PNG, and Vanuatu is limited in all five areas \nidentified  by  ADB's  social  protection  strategy  (para.  1).  The  few  government-provided  or \ngovernment-mandated programs that do exist focus predominantly on those in the formal labor \nmarket.  Protection  for  those  outside  the  formal  sector  is  largely  provided  by  families  or \ncommunities. Traditional or customary protections still play an important role in mitigating the \nrisks of minor shocks, such as temporary job loss or short-term illness, although such forms of \nprotection  are  becoming  less  prevalent,  particularly  in  urban  areas.  Traditional  forms  of \nprotection are largely ineffective in mitigating the risks of major shocks, such as drops in \ncommodity prices and the impact of global economic downturns, because such shocks affect \nthe wider community and their effects are experienced by all, not just the poor and vulnerable. \n \n8.  Governments need to understand the role that social protection interventions can play in \nmitigating  risk  and  vulnerability  and  to  explore  the  benefits  and  costs  of  such  programs. \nAssessing existing programs to see what value they are adding to social and economic risk \nmanagement will help optimize the use of scarce government, donor, private sector, community, \nand  household  resources.  Most  PDMCs  have  little  capacity  in  the  field  of  social  policy \ndevelopment to conduct such assessments or to identify alternatives. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n9.  The purpose of the study is to improve Pacific governments' capacity to develop social \nprotection policies and programs for the poor and vulnerable. The TA is in line with the poverty \nreduction agreements of the participating countries and with ADB\u2019s social protection strategy.  \n \n10.  The major output will be a social protection assessment study, which for each of the \nparticipating countries, Marshall Islands, PNG, and Vanuatu, includes (i) a vulnerability and risk \nprofile; (ii) a summary labor market assessment; (iii) a review and analysis of the current social \nprotection system, both formal and informal, that includes an assessment of its adequacy, \neffectiveness, and efficiency in providing social protection to the vulnerable population; and (iv) \nrecommendations for future social protection policies and programs based on identified needs, \ninstitutional capacity, costs of proposed interventions, and financing options. An outline of the \nstudy is shown in Appendix 2. \n ", "    3 \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  The analytical framework for the study will include the frameworks outlined in ADB\u2019s \nHandbook on Poverty and Social Analysis and social protection strategy. \n \n12.  The TA activities will include: \n(i)  Desk review, research, and analysis of existing data, studies, and literature. \nThe  ADB  participative  poverty  studies  conducted  under  TA  6002-REG,2  will \nprovide data on the nature of poverty and hardship, the perceived needs of the \npoor, and the current coping mechanisms of the poor. An inventory of existing \nsocial protection arrangements (formal and nonformal) will be prepared, including \na description of the arrangements, target groups, coverage, access, and financial \ndimensions, and an evaluation of the arrangements\u2019 adequacy and effectiveness \nfor the poor in general, and for women and special needs groups (such as the \ndisabled and children) in particular. The desk review will also consider other \nrelated assessments conducted by ADB.3 \n(ii)  Field work and primary data collection. Field work will be conducted to review \nsocial protection in place and to verify the findings of the desk research. Focus \ngroup discussions and interviews will be conducted with relevant stakeholders, \nincluding  potential  beneficiaries.  Consultations  with  the  governments  will  be \nundertaken to analyze the effectiveness and efficiency of government-mandated \nand  government-provided  social  protection  programs.  Consultations  with  civil \nsociety will be undertaken to analyze social protection mechanisms outside the \nformal sector. \n(iii)  Stakeholder dialogue and consultation. The study\u2019s findings will be shared \nwith relevant stakeholders to identify recommendations for future government \nconsideration. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $565,000 equivalent. ADB will finance $500,000 \nand the balance of $65,000 equivalent will be provided by the participating governments through \nthe provision of counterpart staff, support services, and office facilities. The TA will be financed \non a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. Appendix 3 \npresents detailed cost estimates and the financing plan. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  ADB will finance two international consultants with expertise in social protection and \npoverty analysis for 12 person-months, and four domestic consultants with expertise in social \nprotection and social development for 24 person-months. Appendix 4 lists the outline terms of \nreference for the consultants. The expected duration of the TA is 6 months, commencing in \nJanuary 2005 and ending in June 2005.
