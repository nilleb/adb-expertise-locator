In 2003, the Government of Cambodia requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nprovide technical assistance (TA) to investigate how  infrastructure development and natural \nresource  management  in  the  Tonle  Sap  basin  could  be  better  driven,  coordinated,  and \nstreamlined.1 From 15\u201323 September 2003, a fact-finding mission of ADB visited Cambodia and \nformulated  the  TA  in  line  with  the  poverty  reduction  partnership agreement between the \nGovernment and ADB and ADB's Tonle Sap Basin Strategy2. The Government recognizes that \npresent institutional arrangements for basin management are inadequate and concurred with \nthe goal, purpose, scope, implementation arrangements,  cost estimates, financing plan, and \nterms of reference identified by the Mission. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The Tonle Sap lake forms a natural floodplain reservoir in northwestern Cambodia. It is \nfed by two main perennial and numerous erratic tributaries, and is drained by the Tonle Sap \nriver into the Mekong river near Phnom Penh. However, when the level of the Mekong river is \nhigh the flow of the Tonle Sap river is reversed and nutrient-rich water is pushed into the lake, \nraising its level by up to 10 meters (m) and increasing its area from about 2,700 square \nkilometers (sq km) in the dry season to 9,000\u201316,000 sq km in the rainy season. This unique \nhydrological cycle and the vast area of seasonally flooded low forest and shrubs that it creates, \nin a tropical climate, results in a very high biodiversity of fish, reptile, bird, mammal, and plant \nspecies.  In  particular,  the  lake  supports  a  huge  human  population  through  its  enormous \nfisheries productivity3 and provides the last refuge for some of Asia\u2019s most globally significant \nbiodiversity. Additionally, the flooded areas offer seasonal breeding and nursery grounds and \nforage areas for fish that migrate to the Mekong river, providing thereby a regionally vital \nresource.4 The Tonle Sap lake also helps to control salinity intrusion and conserve mangrove \nforests in the Mekong delta by acting as a natural reservoir from which water drains during the \ndry season.5 The catchments provide water for irrigation and human consumption and are \nthemselves home to rare, sometimes endangered, species. \n \n3.  However, population6 and development pressures are rising and, despite its inherent \nrichness, most indicators of poverty around the Tonle Sap lake are even more negative than \nthose that  characterize the national population as a whole, or indeed other rural areas of \nCambodia. Half of the villages have between 40\u201360% of households below the official poverty \nline,7 with a peak of 80% in some areas. Adult literacy is only two thirds of the national average. \nMany households have no land holdings and are entirely dependent on fishing and foraging, \nwith access to fishing areas often under dispute. There is a disproportionately high level of \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) in August 2003. \n2  ADB. 2003.  Tonle Sap Basin Strategy. Manila. The strategy is based on three underpinning principles (i) \nsustainable livelihoods, (ii) social justice, and (iii) a basin-wide approach. \n3  The lake's fisheries provide 40\u201370% of the protein intake of Cambodia's population, nearly 50% of whom depend \non the lake\u2019s resources directly or indirectly, while about one million people live in fish-dependent communities. \n4  Many fish species, including the all-important trey riel, migrate between the Mekong river and the Tonle Sap lake, \nutilizing the river for spawning and the flooded forest for growth and maturation. \n5  The Tonle Sap basin contributes 6.4% of the average annual flow of the Mekong river. \n6  A growth rate of 2\u20132.5% per year will more than double Cambodia's population by 2025. \n7  The poverty line is the per capita expenditure needed to secure an intake of 2,100 calories per day. ", "2 \nfemale-headed households that are less resilient to shocks\u2014particularly health problems\u2014\nbecause of the multiple functions of women in the communities. \n \n4.  Each threat to the environment and biodiversity of the Tonle Sap basin has multiple root \ncauses, the severity of which conditions the speed and manner in which they can be addressed. \nImmediate threats include over-exploitation of forest resources, dry season encroachment and \nland clearance of the flooded forest, the increasing resource needs of an expanding population, \nover-exploitation of the fish and wildlife resources of the Tonle Sap lake, and changes in water \nquality and siltation rates. In response, in October 1997, the Government nominated the lake as \na  biosphere  reserve  under  the  Man  and  the  Biosphere  Program  of  the  United  Nations \nEducational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization and  established the Tonle Sap Biosphere \nReserve Secretariat in September 2001 as a focal point of environmental management. In \nNovember 2002, ADB approved a loan and supporting TA for the Tonle Sap Environmental \nManagement Project.8 In recognition of the complexity of the agents of change, ADB has also \nconcluded  that  infrastructure  development  and  natural  resource  management  should  be \nconsidered from the perspective of the basin as a whole, which includes all or part of 8 of the 20 \nprovinces and 4 municipalities of Cambodia.9 ADB's initiative is consistent with its water policy \nand a worldwide trend towards managing land, water, and biotic resources within a framework \nof basin units, as demonstrated by the establishment of the International Network of Basin \nOrganizations, which has more than 100 members. ADB's Country Strategy and Program \nUpdate, 2004\u20132006 for Cambodia reflects this basin-wide approach, which ADB expects to \npursue over a 10-year horizon. \n \n5.  Addressing threats to the Tonle Sap lake requires an integrated, cross-sectoral, cross-\nboundary,  and  multi-disciplinary  institutional  framework  that  operates  at  the  basin  level. \nCurrently, the Cambodia National Mekong Committee (CNMC),10 with a membership of  10 \nministries  and  a  linkage  with  the  Mekong  River  Commission  (MRC),11  is  responsible  for \npromoting basin planning that recognizes the interconnectedness of social, economic, and \nenvironmental factors. In particular, in response to the growing need for better coordination of \nline  agencies,  a  Tonle  Sap  Biosphere  Reserve  Secretariat  was  established  in  CNMC  in \nSeptember  2001.12  Notwithstanding,  CNMC  has  experienced  difficulty  with  institutional \narrangements.  Typically,  line  agencies  define  goals  in  terms  of  quantitative outputs, not \noutcomes, for the subsectors over which they hold sway. Furthermore, the Government has \nsince  1996  been  implementing  a  program  of  decentralization  and  deconcentration  that \nculminated  in  February  2002  with  the  first-ever  commune  elections.  Increasingly,  local \ngovernments  and  communities  are  involved  in  local  natural  resources  planning  and \nmanagement. The benefits are clear. But, devolution of authority over resources does increase \nthe risk of actions in one province impacting others. Ensuring appropriate participation demands \nthe establishment of a structure that involves all stakeholders. Therefore, in 2003, CNMC began \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2002.  Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to \nCambodia for the Tonle Sap Environmental Management Project. Manila. \n9  The Tonle Sap basin covers 67,600 sq km in northwestern Cambodia (38% of Cambodia's total area). \n10 CNMC's mandate is specified in the Subdecree on the Organizational Structure and Function of CNMC of February \n1999. It is to assist and advise the Government in all matters related to the formulation of water policy, strategy, \nmanagement, preservation, investigation, planning, restoration, and the development of the water and other natural \nresources of the Mekong river basin within Cambodia. \n11 MRC's mandate is specified in the Agreement on Cooperation for the Sustainable Development of the Mekong \nRiver Basin of April 1995. \n12 The Secretariat's mandate is to (i) serve as an information clearinghouse open to all, (ii) conduct a nationwide \nawareness and mobilization campaign for the protection and sustainable use of the Tonle Sap lake and its \ncatchments, and (iii) effect cross-sectoral policy and strategy coordination. ", "3 \nto  canvass  local  governments  and  communities  to  move  toward  some  form  of  basin \nmanagement organization congruent with MRC's Basin Development Plan.13 \n \n6.  Basin management is not about command-and-control. It is about harmonizing the \nactivities of a multiplicity of natural resource planners, managers, and users so that their actions \nconsider impacts on resource flows and the needs of others. Achieving this requires the creation \nof institutional processes through which these flows, needs, and impacts can be identified and \nshared by the full range of stakeholders. Critical to this is the establishment of a structure that \nprovides for planning and management at the basin level to be undertaken holistically in the \ncontext of effective dialogues between planners, managers, and users of natural resources, \nbetween  different  levels  of  government,  and  across  administrative  boundaries.  River \nparliaments in India and polder water boards in the Netherlands are two examples of how \nsocieties integrate management of land, water, and biotic resources. Where and how such \norganizations can be established depends on the socio-political context, legal and institutional \narrangements, the economic situation and, not least, the resource characteristics of particular \nbasins. Therefore, the  form and span of authority of such organizations differ. But  effective \nbasin  management  organizations  are  characterized  by  their  ability  to  coordinate  planning, \ncontribute to its implementation, and provide a neutral body to monitor achievement and report \nto stakeholders. Models for basin management organizations are in Appendix 2. \n \n7.  The Tonle Sap  basin is a complex and fragile ecosystem that is (i) crucial to the \nlivelihoods of more than a million people living on and around the Tonle Sap lake, (ii) the \nprimary source of protein for much of the population, (iii) a breeding, nursery, and forage area \nfor fish of the Mekong river basin, and (iv) a biodiversity reservoir of global significance. Its \nmanagement  requires  that  the  right  balance  be  struck  between  social,  economic,  and \nenvironmental factors. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Outputs \n8.  The goal of the TA is sound management of natural resources and the environment in \nthe Tonle Sap basin. Its purpose is to design, and plan the development of, the institutional \nframework for integrated basin planning and management. Its primary output will be a basin \nmanagement organization design. Another output will be the outline of a long-term TA roadmap \nfor establishment and effective operation of the basin management organization. A third output \nwill be the specification of a first TA to support its establishment. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  Basin Management Organization Design. Activities will comprise (i) a preliminary \nreview of existing responsibilities, institutional arrangements, and planning and management \nsystems in the Tonle Sap basin and, (ii) a selective international review of basin management \norganizations. Subsequent activities will determine the most appropriate model of management \norganization  for  the  Tonle  Sap  basin  and  elaborate  its  institutional  framework.  Trade-offs \nbetween design principles will be made explicit. The institutional framework elaborated will \nspecify (i) a constitutional mandate, (ii) the areas of responsibility of the organization, (iii) the \n                                                 \n13 MRC. 2002. Inception Report of the Basin Development Plan. Together with the Water Utilization Program and the \nEnvironment Program, the Basin Development Plan is one of MRC's core programs. It aims to establish a planning \nframework of rules, policies, and processes to balance efficient use of resources with protection of the environment \nand promotion of social justice and equity. \n ", "4 \nstructure of the organization,14 (iv) capacity building requirements,15 and (v) the technical and \nfinancial support needed. \n \n10.  Long-Term Technical Assistance Roadmap. The TA would set the stage for ADB \nassistance to the establishment and effective operation of a Tonle Sap basin management \norganization over  a  10-year  horizon.  Activities  will  specify  the  particulars  of  the  roadmap, \nnamely (i) outcomes, (ii) outputs, (iii) issues and constraints, and (iv) actions, milestones, and \nachievements.  The  components  of  the  roadmap  might  build  capacity  for  (i)  finance and \nadministration, (ii) information systems management, (iii) human resource development, (iv) \nresearch, (v) strategic planning and programming, (vi) intersectoral planning in basins, (vii) \nparticipatory approaches, (viii) environmental education and  awareness creation, (ix) policy \ndialogue, (x) external relations, and (xi) monitoring and evaluation. \n   \n11.  Technical  Assistance  for  Establishment  of  a  Tonle  Sap  Basin  Management \nOrganization. Activities will detail the first advisory assistance to support the establishment of a \nTonle Sap basin management organization, including its goal, purpose, scope, implementation \narrangements, cost estimates, financing plan, and terms of reference. Outputs from the first \nadvisory assistance might cover (i) a policy statement on the proposed institutional framework, \n(ii) legislation to establish a Tonle Sap basin management organization, (iii) an implementation \nplan, (iv) the strategic plan for a Tonle Sap basin management organization, and (v) a proposed \nframework for Tonle Sap basin blueprints.16 \n \n12.  The active involvement of a wide range of stakeholders will be sought throughout the \nTA,  notably  though  workshops.  A  national  workshop  will  be  conducted  3  weeks  from \ncommencement  of  the  TA  to  assess  the  respective  merits  of  different  models  for  basin \nmanagement organizations. Participants will represent government, donor, scientific, private, \nfisherfolk, farmer, nongovernment organization, and other civil society interests. Within 3 weeks \nof the conclusion of the national workshop the consultants will produce a prototypical basin \nmanagement  organization.  An  international  workshop  will  be  conducted  9  weeks  from \ncommencement of the TA to table the revised prototypical basin management organization for \nreview. The two workshops will coincide with tripartite meetings between the Government, the \nconsultants, and ADB. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $160,000 equivalent, comprising $115,000 in \nforeign exchange, and $45,000 equivalent in local currency. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB's funding program. ADB will finance $135,000 equivalent to cover the entire \nforeign exchange cost of $115,000 and $20,000 equivalent of the local currency cost on a grant \nbasis.  The  Government  will  contribute  the  balance  of  the  local  currency  cost  of  $25,000 \nequivalent, mainly in kind. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3. \n \n                                                 \n14 This will include appropriate structures for local government and community representation and the means by \nwhich the organization would interact with such representative bodies and other stakeholders. \n15 The basin management organization would need technical and non-technical capacity to (i) coordinate information, \n(ii) undertake investigations and studies, and (iii) ensure effective development and utilization of models and \ndecision support systems. \n16 Tonle Sap basin blueprints would integrate individual natural resource management plans. Typically, these include \nwater management plans, regional vegetation management plans, and fisheries management plans. The blueprints \nwould set priorities for the basin as a whole, consistent with national and provincial policy. They would be the way \nin which communities and the Government can reconcile competing demands on natural resources and balance \nlong-term environmental outcomes and social and economic aspirations. ", "5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The TA will be implemented by a team of international consultants with expertise in (i) \nwater resource management (2 person-months), (ii) institutions, with experience in community \nparticipation (2 person-months), and (iii) environmental management (1 person-month). About 3 \nperson-months of short-term domestic consultants with knowledge of specific basin issues will \nalso be engaged as needed. The terms of reference for short-term domestic consultants will be \nprepared by the international consultants in consultation with CNMC and ADB. The consultants \nwill be engaged by ADB individually in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \nand other arrangements satisfactory to ADB. The water resource management specialist will act \nas team leader. A staffing schedule is shown in Appendix 4. The consultants will produce (i) an \ninception report within 2 weeks of the commencement of the TA; (ii) a draft final report within 6 \nweeks; and (iii) a final report detailing TA outcomes and recommending actions within 11 \nweeks. CNMC will submit to ADB a TA completion report within 3 months of the end of the TA. It \nwill also fill out a TA completion questionnaire to evaluate the TA's outputs, identify lessons \nlearned, and suggest follow-up actions.  The terms of reference for international consulting \nservices are in Appendix 5. \n \n15.  CNMC is mandated to promote basin planning and will be the executing agency for the \nTA. It will assign counterpart staff to facilitate day-to-day administration of the TA and liaison \nwith CNMC's constituent members. Given the importance of interagency coordination to the \nsuccess of the TA, it will also establish a focus group comprising senior officials of CNMC's \nconstituent members and provincial government. The focus group will (i) promote the TA in \nCNMC's membership, (ii) communicate sectoral mandates, (iii) provide guidance, (iv) resolve \ninstitutional problems, if any, and (v) provide the basis for long-term institutional support to a \nTonle Sap basin management organization. CNMC will explore the possibility of involving in \nfocus group meetings observers representative of civil society interests. \n   \n16.  The TA will be implemented in January-March 2004. It will be allied to ongoing programs \nof CNMC's constituent members, particularly those of the Ministry of Water Resources and \nMeteorology, and MRC. Its deliverables will be disseminated through their information networks. \nADB also publishes a 6-monthly Tonle Sap Initiative brochure and maintains a website for the \nTonle Sap Environmental Management Project giving links to related sites.17 \n \nNovember 2003 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n17 The website is at http://www.adb.org/Projects/tonle_sap/default.asp. \n ", "6     Appendix 1 \n  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \nPerformance  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Monitoring Mechanisms \nIndicators/Targets  and Risks \nGoal       \nSound management of  \u2022  Adopt policies based  \u2022  Technical assistance  \u2022  Political commitment and \nnatural resources and the  on integrated basin  (TA) framework  leadership are catalyzed. \nenvironment in the Tonle  planning and  \u2022  TA completion report  \u2022  CNMC and other line \nSap basin  management.  prepared by the  agencies have a clear \n\u2022  Increase participation  Cambodia National  vision about the sector goal \nof stakeholders in  Mekong Committee  to which the TA will \ndecision making.

Some characteristics of a successful basin management organization are universal: \n(i)  Its area of responsibility is clearly defined. \n(ii)  The  technical  and  financial  inputs  that  are  necessary  to  its  operations  are \nprovided for. \n(iii)  The stakeholders and their form of participation are defined. \n(iv)  It is a public institution. \n \n2.  Typically, the responsibilities of such organizations cover the entire inland phase of the \nwater cycle and are directed towards integrated basin planning and management. To act on \nthese responsibilities, a basin management organization must include: \n(i)  A widely representative body in which public administrations (at all levels), user \nassociations,  and  non-governmental  organizations  are  represented.  Its \nresponsibilities will be the formulation of strategies, planning, and follow-up. \n(ii)  An  executive,  with  the  relevant  financial  resources,  in  charge  of  the  direct \nimplementation of actions or of making them possible by funding. \n(iii)  A multidisciplinary technical team having the necessary technical means for \nachieving efficient management of land, water, and biotic resources and their \nmonitoring. \n(v)  An organization in charge of natural resource use policing and monitoring.2 \n \nB.  Basin Management Models \n \n3.  There are three main models for achieving a stable and strong institutional framework for \nintegrated basin planning and management, with numerous variations possible for each of \nthese. For the purpose of explanation they are described as (i) a basin authority, (ii) a basin \ncommission, and (iii) a basin coordinating committee or council. \n \n1.  Basin Authority \n \n4.  A basin authority is the most comprehensive in powers and functions. A basin authority: \n(i)  Usually absorbs most or all of the functions of line agencies. \n(ii)  Is normally a large multi-disciplinary organization. \n(iii)  Executes regulatory and management functions. \n(iv)  Is appropriate when there is a large development task to be undertaken or when \nline agencies are weak or ineffective. \n \n2.  Basin Commission \n \n5.  This model sits between an authority and a coordinating committee or council in terms of \ncomplexity or strength of the organization, and its \u201cdirect influence\u201d in the basin.  A  basin \ncommission: \n                                                 \n1  Appendix 2 draws from ADB. 1997. Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Red River Basin \nWater Resources Management. \n2  Some of these organizations may be grouped together in a multi-purpose body or merely have their actions \ncoordinated at the basin level. \n ", "10     Appendix 2 \n(i)  Normally  comprises  a  Board  of  Management  representing  all  the  key \nstakeholders, with an expert technical office supporting it. \n(ii)  Can be successfully used when development options are still an issue, basin-\nwide information and policies are non-existent or confused, and system models \nstill need considerable work. A basin commission deals mostly with policy and \nplanning, as well as developing procedures and quality control matters. It may \nregulate  cross-provincial  boundary  water  issues.  It  endorses  and  polices \noperating criteria and ensures that data, information, and models are suitable for \nbasin-wide management issues. \n \n6.  More specifically, such an organization concentrates on: \n(i)  Developing good data systems and predictive hydrologic models. \n(ii)  Establishing base-line information on land, water, and biotic resources in the \nbasin. \n(iii)  Developing  policies  and  strategies  to  guide  planning  and  development,  and \nenvironmental (aquatic-ecosystem) rehabilitation and management. \n(iv)  Developing and maintaining a systematic process of monitoring and reporting on \nthe behavior and health of the basin and uses within it. \n(v)  Providing a forum for line agencies to consider and agree on common rules of \noperation. \n \n7.  Some  operating  functions  may  exist  for  large  infrastructure  development  but  most \noperation and day-to-day management issues remain with individual states or provinces within \nthe basin. Basin commissions may run strategic monitoring stations and operate and manage \nkey hydraulic works. But, most often, basin commissions would have oversight and regulatory \nauthority over large infrastructure by way of an operating agreement or contract with some other \norganization. \n \n3.  Basin Coordinating Committee or Council \n \n8.  This is the least intrusive model in terms of impact on existing arrangements. A basin \ncoordinating committee or council: \n(i)  Would coordinate high-level policy and strategy matters and have no role in daily \noperation or management. It would have limited input to long-term planning and \nno direct influence over regulatory issues. \n(ii)  Normally  comprises  the  heads  of  all  relevant  line  agencies,  with  a  small \nsecretariat supporting it. \n(iii)  Is  appropriate  when  competition  for  natural  resources  is  mostly  resolved, \nsystems such as water trading are in place, and the natural resource sectors are \nstable or mature. \n \nC.

Introduction \n \n1.  The executing agency for the technical assistance (TA) will be the Cambodia National \nMekong Committee (CNMC). CNMC will assign 2 person-months of counterpart staff services to \nimplement the TA. These counterpart staff will be assisted by 5 person-months of international \nconsulting services. Short-term domestic consultants with knowledge of specific basin issues \nwill also be engaged as needed.1 The TA will be implemented in January-March 2004. \n \nB.  Terms of Reference for International Consultants \n \n2.  The Tonle Sap basin defines the planning area. It covers 67,600 square kilometers in \nnorthwestern Cambodia (38% of Cambodia's total area). It comprises three main physiographic \nregions (i) the Tonle Sap lake, extending to a maximum area of 1.6 million hectares in the wet \nseason, now declared a biosphere reserve, and effectively bounded by Highways No. 5 and 6, \n(ii) the low lying watershed, mainly at an altitude of less than 200 meters above mean sea level, \noriginally covered with dry open woodlands interspersed with oases of wetter grasslands and \nevergreen forest but much of which has been depleted by logging and conversion to upland \nagriculture, and (iii) the rainforest of the Cardamom Mountains, rising to a height of up to 1,500 \nmeters above mean sea level, large areas of which are still relatively undisturbed. \n \n3.  Water  Resource  Management  Specialist/Team  Leader  (2  person-months).  The \nWater Resource Management Specialist/Team Leader will conduct a selective international review \nof  basin  management  organizations  to  identify  and  refine,  based  on  the  constraints, \nopportunities,  and  issues  related  to  infrastructure  development  and  natural  resource \nmanagement in the Tonle Sap basin, a prototypical basin management organization and a long-\nterm roadmap for ADB assistance to establish and make it operational. He/she will also lead the \nteam and take responsibility for coordinating TA activities and accomplishing TA outputs with the \nsupport and inputs of the other team members. Specifically, he/she will: \n(i)  Represent the team at focus group meetings organized to facilitate interagency \ncoordination. \n(ii)  In  conjunction  with  the  Environmental  Management  Specialist,  prepare  a \ndelineation and characterization of the Tonle Sap basin. \n(iii)  Assess  the  constraints,  opportunities,  and  issues  related  to  infrastructure \ndevelopment and natural resource management in the Tonle Sap basin with \nparticular  reference  to  potential  cross-provincial  boundary  conflicts  and  the \nhydrological  regime  of  the  Tonle  Sap  lake.  Together  with  the  other  team \nmembers, prioritize basin and sub-basin issues, and demonstrate how they may \nbe more effectively addressed through a basin management organization. These \nshould include environmental, social, and economic issues. \n(iv)  Lead a selective international review of basin management organizations. This \nactivity  will  benefit  from  reference  to  the  International  Network  of  Basin \nOrganizations,2 the Network of Asian River Basin Organizations promoted by the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB)3, and the Water Framework Directive of the \n                                                 \n1  The terms of reference for short-term domestic consultants will be prepared by the international consultants in \nconsultation with CNMC and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). \n2  The website is at http://www.riob.org/riobang.htm. \n3  Details are at http://www.adb.org/Water/network.asp. \n ", "16  Appendix 5 \nEuropean  Union.4  Subsequently,  prepare  a  comprehensive  analysis  of  the \ndifferent roles, responsibilities, and structures of alternative models of basin \nmanagement organizations. \n(v)  With the Institutions Specialist, set current basin management systems operating \nwithin  the  Tonle  Sap  basin  in  the  context  of  alternative  models  of  basin \nmanagement organization. \n(vi)  Lead  the  preparation  of  the  most  appropriate  model  of  basin  management \norganization,  and  the  elaboration  of  an  implementable  basin  management \norganizational framework. The framework for the organization would indicate its \nareas of responsibility, the technical and financial support required, and the \nmeans  by  which  the  organization  would  interact  with  stakeholders.  The \nframework  will  be  informed  by  the  Tonle  Sap  lake's  status  as  a  biosphere \nreserve.5 It will recognize that the importance of the Tonle Sap lake extends far \nbeyond the boundaries of Cambodia. It will also be guided by the organizational \nframework  promoted  by  the  Mekong  River  Commission  (MRC)'s  Basin \nDevelopment Plan (Figure A5). \n(vii)  Prepare, together with the other team members, a discussion paper describing a \nprototypical  basin  management  organization  to  be  tabled  for  review  by  key \nstakeholders, including the international Water Resources Management Advisor \nto CNMC. \n(viii)  Coordinate the consultative process to assess the respective merits of different \nmodels for basin management organizations and review the prototypical basin \nmanagement  organization.  Consultations  will  encompass  a  broad  range  of \nstakeholders, including government, donor, scientific, private, fisherfolk, farmer, \nnongovernment organization, and other civil society interests. \n(ix)  Following the conclusion of the international workshop, produce in conjunction \nwith  the  Institutions  Specialist  a  revised  prototypical  basin  management \norganization  and  a  long-term  roadmap  for  ADB  assistance  to  effect  its \nestablishment and effective operation. To this intent, the roadmap will specify (a) \noutcomes, (b) outputs, (c) issues and constraints, and (d) actions, milestones, \nand achievements. It will  also suggest partners that might wish to associate \nthemselves with the basin management organization. \n(x)  Formulate,  together  with  the  other  team  members  and  key  stakeholder \nrepresentatives, a first advisory assistance to support the establishment of the \nprototypical  basin  management  organization.  The  first  advisory  assistance \nshould  include  development  of  the  rationale,  objectives,  scope,  sequence  of \nactivities,  cost  estimates  and  financing  plan,  implementation  arrangements, \nbenchmark  indicators,  monitoring  and  evaluation  mechanisms,  and  the \ncommitments of the Government, for consideration by ADB. \n(xi)  Be responsible for the timely production of reports detailing the TA activities \nundertaken and the outputs delivered and their submission to CNMC and ADB \nfor review and endorsement. \n                                                 \n4  World Wildlife Fund. 2001.
