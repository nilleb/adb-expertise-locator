THE PROPOSAL \n  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nMongolia for additional financing of the Regional Improvement of Border Services Project.  \n \n  The additional financing will scale up the Regional Improvement of Border Services \nProject (the ongoing project) by (i) upgrading facilities and equipment at two border-crossing \npoints (BCPs)\u2014Bichigt, bordering the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) in the east; and Borshoo, \nbordering the Russian Federation (Russia) in the west; and (ii) providing capacity development \nsupport for Mongolia border agencies. The infrastructure, facilities, and equipment at the Bichigt \nand Borshoo BCPs are outdated and inadequate to provide high standards of trade facilitation \nand immigration services and accommodate anticipated growth in cross-border trade.1  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT  \nA.  Rationale \n  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved the ongoing project on 22 April 2016 and \nthe project loan became effective on 11 July 2016, with ADB providing $27 million in financing \nfrom its ordinary capital resources. The ongoing project comprised the following three outputs: (i) \nimprovement  of  the  Altanbulag,  Zamiin-Uud,  and  Bichigt  BCPs  through  infrastructure \nrehabilitation and provision of equipment ($14.25 million); (ii) upgrading of the customs automated \ninformation system; and (iii) preparatory work for the development of a single electronic window \nsystem2 in Mongolia (about $10 million total for outputs 2 and 3).  \n \n  A year into implementation, the Government of Mongolia (the government) requested that \nresources  for  the  partial  rehabilitation  of  the  three  BCPs  (output  1)  be  reallocated  to  a \ncomprehensive upgrading of the BCP in Selenge province3 (Altanbulag is the road BCP that only \noperates 24 hours per day in Mongolia and Sukhbaatar is the BCP for rail transport). ADB \napproved the minor change in scope on 20 October 2017 and, following this approval, output 1 \ncomprised: (i) a comprehensive upgrading of facilities at the Altanbulag BCP; (ii) provision of basic \nequipment to strengthen customs processing capacity at the Altanbulag, Zamiin-Uud, and Bichigt \nBCPs; (iii) construction of a 1.6-kilometer bypass road from the Altanbulag BCP to the main road; \nand (iv) construction of a single-stop service center for all border agencies4 at the Sukhbaatar \nBCP. The ongoing project\u2019s closing date is 31 December 2023. \n \n5.  The ongoing project is evaluated as performing well: (i) it is rated on track; (ii) there is full \ncompliance with the safeguard covenants;5 (iii) management of risks is rated successful; and (iv) \n                                                \n1  The additional financing is included in ADB. 2017. Country Partnership Strategy: Mongolia, 2017\u22122020\u23afSustaining \nInclusive Growth in a Period of Economic Difficulty. Manila; and ADB. 2018. Country Operations Business Plan: \nMongolia, 2019\u22122021. Manila. On 7 December 2018, ADB approved transaction technical assistance for Preparing \nRegional Cooperation and Integration Projects in Mongolia.  \n2  As specified in the United Nations Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business Recommendation Number \n33, the Single Electronic Window System is a facility that allows parties involved in trade and transport to lodge \nstandardized information and documents with a single entry point to fulfill all import, export, and transit-related \nregulatory requirements. If information is electronic, then individual data elements should only be submitted once. \n3  Both Altanbulag and Sukhbaatar BCPs are located in Selenge province, bordering the Russian Federation (Russia) \nin the north. Both BCPs belong to Selenge branches of the four border agencies.     \n4  According to the Mongolian Law on Border, Mongolian Customs General Administration, General Agency for \nSpecialized Inspection, General Authority for Border Protection and Mongolia Immigration Agency are considered as \nborder agencies.  \n5  Since actual construction activities have not started, no safeguards implementation monitoring reports have been \nproduced. \n ", "2   \ncivil works contracts worth $12.9 million are expected to be awarded in Q4 2019. As of 26 June \n2019, the cumulative contract award amount was $3.20 million, or 11.9% of the net loan amount, \nwhile the cumulative disbursement was $2.18 million, or 8.1% of the net loan amount.  The main \nreasons that contract awards and disbursements are comparatively low are: (i) re-organization of \nthe government following the parliament election in June 2016; (ii) start-up problems that the \nproject  implementation  unit  (PIU)  was  facing  (i.e.,  delays  in  recruitment  of  the  project \nimplementation  unit  (PIU)  staff;  establishment  of  consultant  selection  committees  and  bid \nevaluation committees and preparation of the terms of reference for major procurement packages; \n(iii) the minor change of scope for output 1 that had to be processed prior to the actual \nimplementation of the project; and (iv) the need to prepare conceptual and detailed engineering \ndesigns and  realistic cost estimates for the proposed infrastructure facilities during project \nimplementation. However, these start-up problems were resolved in close consultation with \nexecuting and implementing agencies. Currently, the detailed engineering designs of all proposed \nBCP facilities have been prepared and the procurement of the civil works contractors is ongoing. \nAs a result, over the elapsed project implementation period time (43% as of 26 June 2019), \nimplementation stands at 25%.  \n \n6.  Additional financing. The proposed additional financing is needed to scale up the \nongoing project by (i) comprehensively upgrading facilities and equipment at Bichigt BCP and \ninclude  Borshoo  BCP,  and  (ii)  providing  capacity  development  support  to  targeted  border \nagencies. \n \n7.   Development challenges. The rationale of the ongoing project continues to be valid for \nthe additional financing. As a landlocked country between the PRC and Russia, a large share of \nMongolia\u2019s gross domestic product is linked to foreign trade.  From 2009 to 2017, exports   \nincreased from about $1.9 billion to $6.2 billion. Over that same period, imports increased from \n$2.1 billion to $4.3 billion.6 Mongolia\u2019s exports are heavily concentrated in mineral products, which \nincreased from 40% of total exports in 2004 to 89% of total exports in 2017.7 While this export-\nled growth model contributed to an average economic growth rate of 7% per year from 2009 to \n2018, the model is highly vulnerable to fluctuations in mining-related foreign direct investment \n(FDI) and commodity price volatility. Economic growth fell from a high of 17.3% in 2011 to 1.2% \nin  2016,  coinciding  with  a  drop  in  international  mineral  prices,  before  recovering  again  in \nsucceeding years, driven by increases in FDI and exports. \n \n8.  Another key constraint on export-led growth is the poor quality of border crossing facilities \n(dilapidated infrastructure, use of outdated equipment, and low utilization of information and \ncommunication technology). This results in high trade costs that undermine the competitiveness \nand diversification of Mongolia\u2019s exports. Long and unpredictable transportation times constrain \nexports and weaken Mongolia\u2019s ability to participate in global production networks. Bottlenecks at \nthe border also drive up the cost of importing key inputs for manufacturing, which in turn limits the \ncountry\u2019s production and suppresses exports of manufactured goods. Investments in BCPs and \ncustoms operations can thus significantly reduce trade-related transaction costs while increasing \ncross-border trade volumes. In response, ADB has been supporting the improvement of border \nfacilities in Mongolia. \n \n9.  The Bichigt BCP is Mongolia\u2019s closest gateway to the sea through a seaport in the PRC \n(Jinzhou Port), which is connected by extensive road and rail links to the PRC\u2019s northeast. Jinzhou \nPort is one of the few ports in the PRC that is both rail-served and has the capacity to handle \n                                                \n6   ADB. 2018. Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific 2018. Manila.  \n7   Bank of Mongolia. 2017. Mongolia\u2019s Foreign Trade Review December 2017. Ulaanbaatar. \n \n ", "    3 \n \ntransit trade from Mongolia. However, the Bichigt BCP is underutilized because of the poor state \nof its facilities\u2014in contrast to Zuun Khatavch on the PRC side of the border, which has high \nthroughput capacity, modern customs facilities, and good connectivity infrastructure.8 \n \n10.  The anticipated growing strategic importance of the Borshoo BCP in the Western Mongolia \nand its planned upgrade to international status in 2019 drove selection of Borshoo for additional \nfinancing.9This is in line with a bilateral connectivity agreement between Mongolia and Russia, \nsigned in 2007, which gained renewed commitment following a visit by Mongolia\u2019s Minister of \nForeign  Affairs  to  Moscow  in  May  2018.10 The  National  Urban  Assessment  for  Mongolia \nconducted as part of the ADB supported technical assistance11 in 2017 has identified priority \nregional urban cluster systems as key assets to catalyze local urban economic growth. The \ntranche 1 of the proposed Aimag and Soum Centers Regional Development Investment Program \nwill target west regional urban clusters as Ulaangom (114 kilometer from Borshoo BCP), Ulgii, \nand Khovd. \n \n11.  The government expects the two BCPs to become increasingly functional gateways for \nMongolia\u2019s bilateral and transit trade with and through the PRC and Russia. Statistics12 show that \nusage of these BCPs is growing despite their limited capacity. At Bichigt, cross-border passenger \nflows increased by about 80% from 2015 to 2017, while trade turnover more than tripled to $220 \nmillion during the same period (with exports accounting for 86% of that).13 In Borshoo, trade \nturnover increased by 27% in 2018 compared with 2017, from $22.5 million to $28.5 million.14 The \neconomic analysis prepared for the project projected that by 2026 trade turnover in Bichigt will \nalmost double to $400 million (including $95 million in imports), while trade turnover in Borshoo \nwill more than triple to $95 million (mostly imports). Finally, improved BCPs will create regional \nbenefits in the form of cost and time savings. \n \n12.  Key innovative features of the project include a tailor-made process for designing the \nBCPs  (fully  reflective  of  local  circumstances,  informed  by  the  use  of  real-time  corridor \nperformance measurement and monitoring data); a design process that is used in the BCPs that \nreceive support from ADB has served as a model for support to other BCPs; and preparation of \nconceptual and detailed engineering designs prior to Board approval.  \n \n13.   The additional financing of the ongoing project complies with the eligibility criteria for \nadditional financing by ADB. The project remains technically feasible as well as economically \nviable and financially sound. Activities and outputs under the additional financing are accorded \nhigh priority by the government and are aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for \nMongolia, 2017\u20132020 and the country operations business plan for Mongolia, 2019\u22122021.15 \n                                                \n8  Government resolution No.142 of 10 May 2017 (National Road Development Plan) includes provisions to renovate \nthe Bichigt BCP. The National Council on Border Development (Decree No.2 dated 7 June 2018) accorded the \nrehabilitation of the Borshoo BCP. \n9  BCPs with international status can be crossed by 3rd country citizens, i.e., citizens from countries other than the two \nbordering countries. \n10  The Russian Government is investing in developing this border area as a node of cross-border connectivity by \nconstructing a connecting road to the M54 federal highway (linking the area to a vast road network), with completion \nexpected by 2020. \n11  ADB. 2017.

The ongoing project was conceptualized within the framework of the Central \nAsia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) program\u2019s Transport and Trade Facilitation \nStrategy 2020, and the ongoing project contributes to CAREC\u2019s Integrated Trade Agenda 2030.16 \nAs such, it supports ADB\u2019s goal to improve trade competitiveness along the CAREC corridors. \nThe scope for the additional financing for the upgrade of the Borshoo and Bichigt BCPs is fully \naligned with the strategic fit of the ongoing project.  \n \n15.  Furthermore, the proposed additional financing is (i) aligned with the Action Plan of the \nGovernment of Mongolia, 2016\u20132020 to improve BCPs and expand trade; (ii) accorded high \npriority by the government, with a high degree of project readiness (the government financed the \ndetailed design for Borshoo); (iii) consistent with the country partnership strategy, 2017\u20132020, \nwhich emphasizes the need to improve physical connectivity and trade facilitation to enhance the \ncompetitiveness of the Mongolian economy (pillar 2);17 (iv) consistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 \nand Operational Cluster 2 (trade, tourism, and economic corridors) of CAREC 2030;18 (vi) \ncontributing  to  the  implementation  of  the  operational  directions  1  (connectivity)  and  2 \n(competitiveness) of the Regional Cooperation and Integration Operational Plan, 2016\u20132020;19 \nand (vii) based on firm due diligence to ensure the technical feasibility, economic viability, and \nfinancial soundness of the proposed investment components. \n \n16.  The additional financing is an integral part of a wider framework of existing and pipeline \nprojects  for  regional  cooperation  and  integration  projects  in  Mongolia  and  selected  border \nprovinces of the PRC. \n \n17.  The additional financing modality is the most appropriate and efficient modality to fund the \nproposed expansion of the ongoing project. The current implementation arrangements for the \nongoing project (e.g., project steering committee, executing and implementing agencies, PIU, \nprocurement arrangements, and financial management arrangements) will be maintained, and  \nthe conceptual and detailed engineering designs of the proposed two BCPs are being developed \nin parallel to project preparation, thus ensuring a high degree of readiness for the implementation \nof the additional financing. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n18.  The project is aligned with the following impact: trade and competitiveness increased. The \nproject will have the following outcome: cost and time of compliance with trade procedures \nreduced. The impact and outcome will be aligned with the ongoing project. \n \nC.  Outputs \n19.

Implementation Arrangements \n23.  The additional financing will follow the same implementation arrangements as the ongoing \nproject. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be the executing agency and will oversee the overall \nproject  implementation  and  management  activities.  The  Mongolian  Customs  General \nAdministration (MCGA) will be the implementing agency. The PIU established under the ongoing \nproject will oversee day-to-day management and liaise with all relevant government offices. A \nproject steering committee, chaired by the MOF, will facilitate successful project implementation. \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  October 2019\u2013December 2023 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2023 \nEstimated loan closing date  30 June 2024 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  MOF established and chaired the PSC. The PSC is composed of senior officials \nof the MOF, MCGA, cabinet secretariat, General Authority for Border Protection, \nMongolia Immigration Agency, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, General Agency for \nSpecialized Inspection, Information and Communication Technology and Post \nAuthority, and Mongolian National Chamber of Commerce and Industry.  \n(ii)  Executing agency  MOF \n(iii)  Key implementing agency  MCGA  \n(iv)  Implementation unit  MOF established a PIU with eight staff. It is headed by a project coordinator \nand includes a deputy coordinator/ICT specialist, infrastructure specialist, \nprocurement specialist, finance specialist, monitoring and evaluation \nspecialist, administrative officer, and a driver.

All procurement to be financed by ADB will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). All consulting services to be \nfinanced under the project will be engaged in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The project team will align the project \nimplementation,  procurement,  and  financial  management  with  the  government\u2019s  standard \noperating procedures. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nF.  Technical \n25.  The MCGA has embarked on several reform and modernization initiatives aimed at easing \nthe flow of goods and persons across borders. By using information technology in particular, it \nhas managed to improve operational efficiency and effectiveness. The government and the \nproject team assessed the operations of customs and other border agencies at the two additional \nBCPs, particularly in relation to how the flow of goods and people through the border might be \nimproved and contribute to facilitating trade. Based on the performance of customs agencies and \nan evaluation of existing capacity, the government will procure equipment to enable each BCP to \ncarry out inspections more swiftly and efficiently.24 The project consultants will train the staff on \nhow to use the equipment. \n \nG.  Economic and Financial \n26.  The financial analysis included an assessment of financial sustainability of both MOF and \nMCGA to determine the fiscal impact of the incremental recurrent costs, including operation and \nmaintenance  (O&M)  costs  during  operations.  Similar  to  most  ministries  in  Mongolia,  the \nimplementing agency relies heavily on central government funding. The analysis confirmed that, \ngiven the unpredictability of budget allocations, the risk to financial sustainability is substantial. \nThe analysis indicated that this risk has been sufficiently mitigated through the inclusion in the \nloan agreement of an assurance that the government will allocate adequate budgetary resources. \nThese will cover the recurrent costs associated with O&M of the information technology systems \nand other facilities to be upgraded under the project. The fiscal impact of the project falls well \nwithin the government\u2019s projected revenue capacities. \n \n27.  The project team found the proposed additional financing to be economically viable, with \nan  overall  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  11.2%  and  economic  net  present  value  of \nMNT11.7 billion. When assessed individually, each investment in the four-total project BCPs are \nalso estimated to yield returns above the 9% threshold. In each BCP, the additional investment \nand recurrent costs are expected to be offset by time savings for customs officials and travelers, \nas well as for transporters and traders from faster turnaround of goods; and increased trade \nactivity in the project BCPs, which are in strategic locations along Mongolia's borders with Russia \nand the PRC. The overall project has an economic internal rate of return of 14.4% and economic \nnet present value of MNT53.2 billion. \n \n                                                \n24 Including but not limited to x-ray machines, testing equipment for narcotics and explosives, closed-circuit television, \nand base station monitors and surveillance. \n ", "8   \nH.  Governance \n28.  Through the financial management assessment update, the project team assessed the \ncapacity of the Ministry of Finance (as the executing agency) and the PIU, which has been \nperforming satisfactorily on the ongoing project and will continue to handle all project financial \nmatters. The updated financial management capacity assessment concluded that the overall \nproject financial management risk is moderate. This rating is based on the observation that the \nPIU  is  well-established  and  functioning  well.  To  further  improve  project  governance,  the \ngovernment will strengthen the PIU\u2019s internal audit function. Since the project concerns additional \nfinancing that will be implemented by the same PIU and through the same implementation \narrangements as the ongoing project, the same guidelines for procurement and consulting \nservices will be followed.     \n \n29.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  MOF.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM. \n \nI.  Poverty and Social \n30.  As a landlocked country, Mongolia needs to improve trade facilitation, enter into transit \nand international trade arrangements, and attract FDI to boost its competitiveness and promote \nsustainable  and  inclusive  growth.  Constraints  such  as  inadequate  BCP  infrastructure  and \ncumbersome border procedures must be overcome to improve the performance of CAREC \ncorridors, minimize the economic impact of Mongolia\u2019s geographic isolation, foster more diverse \neconomic activity, and realize the full economic potential of the country. Encouraging local people, \nespecially women, to participate in cross-border trade is another priority.  \n \n31.  Direct impacts of the project will be improved efficiency of importing and exporting and \nincreased local employment opportunities resulting from an increase in trade. By eliminating \nphysical and administrative obstacles to trade at BCPs, the project will contribute to a general \nlowering of goods prices. Better infrastructure at BCPs, modern equipment, and streamlined \ncustoms procedures will reduce waiting times at BCPs and ease the flow of products across \nborders. Improved trade logistics will decrease the cost of doing business. These should lead to \nlower  consumer  prices  in  markets,  thereby  contributing  to  improved  living  standards  and \nincreased international competitiveness for Mongolia.  \n \n32.  Regarding gender mainstreaming, the project is classified some gender elements. A \ncomprehensive policy and legal framework will deal with gender and social dimensions. Improved \naccess to economic opportunities such as cross-border trade and enhanced rights and security \nwill help minimize gender disparity. The social development action plan outlines proactive gender \ndesign features, indicators, and targets. The project design includes actions to build the capacity \nof customs and border staff to address communicable diseases and respond to human trafficking, \nsexual harassment, exploitation, and abuse. \n \nJ.  Safeguards \n33.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.  \n \n34.  Environment (category B). The project team has prepared an initial environmental \nexamination (IEE), including an environmental management plan (EMP), in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), for the components to be supported through additional \n ", "    9 \n \nfinancing. The project team has discussed the IEE with the central government counterparts and \nthe  staff  of  the  two  BCPs. The  EMP  outlines  mitigation  and  monitoring  requirements  and \ninstitutional responsibilities to ensure proper environmental management throughout construction \nand O&M. The executing agency, through the PIU, will be responsible for the implementation of \nthe EMP and for compliance with Mongolian national laws and regulations, including inspection, \nmonitoring, reporting, and corrective actions or measures. 25 \n \n35.  No unprecedented or irreversible impacts on the environment are anticipated. Short-term \nimpacts are anticipated during construction, including dust, noise, and waste generated during \nearthwork and civil works activities. O&M training and performance monitoring will minimize \noperational impacts and risks and optimize environmental benefits. The project\u2019s climate change \nimpact will be low. The IEE concludes that effective EMP implementation, together with training, \nwill result in residual impacts within the limits of the Mongolian standards defined in the EMP. The \nPIU has a proven track record in supporting the implementation of safeguards. No further capacity \ndevelopment will be required. The project team disclosed information and conducted meaningful \npublic  consultations  for  the  project  components  through  face-to-face  meetings  with  local \ninhabitants at four locations near the Bichigt BCP on 13 May 2019, and in Sagil County and \nUlaangom center near the Borshoo BCP on 19\u221222 May 2019. MOF will establish a project-level \ngrievance  redress  mechanism  (GRM)  in  compliance  with  the  Safeguard  Policy  Statement \nrequirement  to  receive  and  facilitate  resolution  of  complaints  about  the  project  during  the \nconstruction and operation phases. The GRM includes procedures for receiving grievances; \ndocumenting key information; and evaluating and responding within a reasonable time frame to \nenvironmental,  health,  and  safety  concerns  associated  with  the  project  construction  and \noperation. The proposed project-level GRM, including a time-bound flowchart of procedures, is \nincluded in Section G of the project EMP.26 \n \n36.  Involuntary resettlement (category C). There will be no land acquisition or involuntary \nrestrictions on land use or access to legally designated parks and protected areas. The Borshoo \nBCP is located on land owned by the local Customs Office, while the Bichigt BCP will be relocated \non vacant state-owned land that has not been allocated to any entities.27 Therefore, the project \nwill not physically or economically displace any persons or households or adversely impact the \nlivelihood or sources of income of any persons or households. \n \n37.  Indigenous peoples (category C). There are no communities near the BCPs. The BCPs \nare located in provinces inhabited by ethnic groups such as Dariganaga, Durvud, and Khoton. \nThey are not considered distinct indigenous groups by the government or ADB\u2019s indigenous \npeoples\u2019 criteria.  \n \n                                                \n25 On behalf of the government, the PIU has updated the IEE for the ongoing project to reflect the change of scope; the \nEMP for the ongoing project is included in relevant bidding documents.  \n26 The additional financing is complemented by an ongoing ADB-supported project that seeks to strengthen sanitary \nand phytosanitary measures around cross-border trade (ADB. Mongolia: Regional Upgrades of Sanitary and \nPhytosanitary Measures for Trade Project.)  \n27 As confirmed through a letter from the Mongolian General Authority for Border Protection (dated 27 June 2019), \nwhich stipulated that, in accordance with Clause 26.1 of Article 26 of the Mongolian Law on Border effective on 1 \nFebruary 2017, \u201cState border is the territory that has set up special procedure without enforcing the state borders \nregulation, setting up borders and checking authority, setting up border engineering and technical facilities for more \nthan 15 kilometers within the national boundary line. The BCP at Bichigt and the security of the border port are an \nintegral part of state border protection.\u201d \n \n ", "10  \nK.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n38.  The benefits and impacts of the overall project are expected to outweigh the costs and \nrisks, while the overall risk after mitigation measures are in place will be moderate. Major risks \nand mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the risk assessment \nand risk management plan.28  \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nExpanded project scope, which will require recruitment  The project team and the ADB will organize a series of \nof an additional project management specialist, with  procurement workshops and specialized training for the \nstrong financial management skills, and additional  new recruits. \nprocurement staff.
