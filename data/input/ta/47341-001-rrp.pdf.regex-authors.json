I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche  financing  facility  (MFF)  to  India  for  the  South  Asia  Subregional  Economic \nCooperation  (SASEC)  Road  Connectivity  Investment  Program  (SRCIP).  The  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n2.  SRCIP will improve the road connectivity and efficiency of the international trade corridor \nby expanding about 500 kilometers (km) of roads in the North Bengal and Northeastern Region \n(NB-NER) of India. The project area under SRCIP is a key strategic thoroughfare integrating \nSouth  and  Southeast  Asia,  and  bordering  Bangladesh,  Bhutan,  Myanmar,  and  Nepal. \nImprovements in road connectivity in NB-NER will enable efficient and safe transport within India \nand regionally with other SASEC member countries.1 Ultimately, SRCIP will pave the way from \nIndia and other South Asian countries to Myanmar, and further afield to link with the Association \nof Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). SRCIP was endorsed by the SASEC trade facilitation and \ntransport working group meeting in Singapore on 30 October 2013. \n \nII.  THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale     \n \n3.  Although South Asia is one of the fastest growing economic regions in the world, intra-\nregional trade is still only some 2% of total trade, compared with 25% in ASEAN, 40% in North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement countries, and 63% in the European Union. While free trade \nmovements are being agreed and implemented, investment needs to be stimulated through \nimproved road and cross-border connectivity, particularly in less developed areas like NB-NER.  \n \n4.  Road transport is the dominant mode among SASEC countries, accounting for 65%\u2013\n70% or more of freight movement. Since most trade between India and its neighbors is by road, \nthe role of road transport is expected to increase with development and the easing of cross-\nborder trade restrictions. Trade between SASEC countries via India to Myanmar and Thailand is \ncurrently  by  sea,  which  makes  exchanges  slow  and  expensive,  especially  for  landlocked \ncountries and NB-NER. Cross-border trade by road between India and Myanmar comprises only \n1.5% of the total road-based cross-border trade of Myanmar ($1.1 billion), against 70% with the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China and 26% with Thailand. Industry estimates suggest that improved \nconnectivity through the India\u2013Myanmar\u2013Thailand trilateral highway could increase India\u2019s trade \nwith ASEAN to about $100 billion by 2020.  \n \n5.  One  of  the  major  constraints  for  regional  connectivity  is  the  \u201clast-mile\u201d  connectivity \nbetween the in-country trunk road network and neighboring countries, which is often left out of \ndevelopment plans. This is the case in NB-NER where the in-country trunk road has four-lanes \nand  is  mostly  in  good  condition  under  the  government\u2019s  National  Highway  Development \nProgram (NHDP) while extensions from the trunk road to neighboring countries are generally \nnarrow two-lane roads in poor condition. The annual average traffic on these last-mile stretches \nis  generally  20,000\u201330,000  passenger  car  units  along  the trunk road  to  only  3,000\u20139,000 \npassenger car units near the border, mainly because of the limited road capacity which is \nexacerbated by cross-border transport inefficiency. In general, the road network capacity in NB-\nNER is limited by geographic constraints, limited availability of land, and increased congestion. \nSecurity  concerns  in  border  areas  also  lower  network  utilization.  Nonetheless,  improving \n                                                \n1  Comprising Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and Nepal. ", "2 \nconnectivity in NB-NER is the key to regional integration of South and Southeast Asia. Improved \nroad capacity and conditions, along with easing of cross-border movement restrictions, will \nincrease trade and the resultant traffic and network utilization, and will ultimately improve the \nsecurity situation in the region and cross-border transport efficiency.  \n \n6.  Four regional platforms involving India provide strategic direction for regional transport \nconnectivity: (i) Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation \n(BIMSTEC),2 (ii) South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), (iii) SASEC, and \n(iv) the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP). \nThe UNESCAP Asian Highway Network provides interregional priority roads for South Asia, \nwhile the SAARC highway corridors provide intra-subregional priority roads for South Asia. \nBIMSTEC has developed a policy framework and strategy for regional connectivity. \n \n7.  Investment in last-mile connectivity is in line with the central government\u2019s prioritization \nof the non-NHDP network, which contributes directly to regionally balanced and inclusive growth \nfor remote, economically lagging or challenging regions. During the Five-Year Plan, FY2012\u2014\nFY20163 the broad assessment of investment needs for the non-NHDP network with state \npublic works departments is about Rs570 billion, out of which Rs74 billion is expected to be \nmobilized from the private sector and Rs108 billion will be an external assistance loan. The \ncentral government is also finalizing a regional road connectivity program (Fostering Regional \nConnectivity:  Widening  and  Upgrade  of  Highways  Along  the  International  Borders).  This \nprogram  targets  1,000 km  at  a  cost  of  about  Rs65,000 million.  Financing from the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) can be effectively utilized for last-mile connectivity to strengthen both \nintra-SASEC  and  SASEC\u2013Myanmar  connectivity  by  leveraging  public\u2013private  partnership \nprojects undertaken for the trunk road network under the NHDP.  \n \n8.  ADB is supporting the development of major international roads in neighboring countries, \nand  strengthening  customs  systems.  Land  customs  stations  with  Bhutan,  Bangladesh, \nMyanmar, and Nepal are under development with support from the respective governments and \nADB.4 SRCIP is part of the critical development for regional connectivity. \n \n9.  India\u2019s road sector faces several issues, including inefficient implementation, poor road \nasset management, high incidence of road accidents, and vehicle overloading. The government \nis  confronting  these  deficiencies  through  various  initiatives  and  support  from  development \npartners.  For  national  highways,  the  World  Bank\u2019s  National  Highway  Interconnectivity \nInvestment Program is expected to provide substantial support to the Ministry of Road Transport \nand Highways (MoRTH) to implement contracting and institutional reform measures and to \ndevelop sector policies with emphasis on road safety. For state road agencies in NB-NER, \nincluding  Manipur  Public  Works  Department  (MPWD),  which  will  implement  state  roads \nimprovement  under  SRCIP,  capacity  development  support  is  ongoing  through  technical \nassistance together with the ADB-assisted Northeastern State Road Investment Program5 for \nroad asset management, road safety quality systems, and institutional strengthening. \n \n10.  SRCIP will include the first stage of the government regional connectivity program. The \nplanned  investments  under  SRCIP  underline  the  connectivity  with  neighboring  countries \n                                                \n2  Comprising Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Thailand. \n3  Government of India.

Manila (Loan 2770, TA 7838, and TA 8063). \n ", "3 \n(Bangladesh,  Bhutan,  Nepal,  and  Myanmar).  Subprojects  being  considered  under  SRCIP \ninclude improvement to roads covering last-mile connectivity in the states of West Bengal and \nManipur. The road map of the investment program also includes improvement to state roads in \nManipur to avoid congestion, taking into account expected increases in international traffic, and \nprovision of alternate routes to national highways for greater access to isolated border areas. \n \n11.  NB-NER is an underdeveloped region. Improved connectivity to NB-NER for regionally \nbalanced and inclusive growth would be well served by the envisaged subprojects under SRCIP. \nThese subprojects will bring new wealth to NB-NER, providing alternative optimal routes for NB-\nNER to reach the established deep water seaports in Bangladesh, India, and Myanmar. These \nroutes are along Asian Highways 1, 2, and 48; and overlap with SAARC highway corridors, and \ntheir extensions and/or alternates. The investment program may  cover additional routes to \nprovide regional connectivity among SASEC and with Myanmar. Traffic through Manipur and \nWest Bengal is expected to increase substantially because of improved access to and from \nother Indian states, and connectivity with neighboring countries\u2014transforming NB-NER into a \nregional trading hub. \n \n12.  Transport infrastructure development is the government\u2019s high priority, making ADB\u2019s \nstrategy  of  reducing  poverty  through  infrastructure-led  growth  especially  relevant.  ADB\u2019s \ncontinued support for regional connectivity is in line with its India country partnership strategy, \n2013\u20132017.6 SRCIP has been designed in coordination with development partners to avoid \noverlaps, and continues ADB support for implementation efficiency of road agencies in parallel \nwith improvement to last-mile connectivity for regional cooperation. Recommendations by the \ncountry partnership strategy final review validation report (footnote 6) have been taken into \naccount, e.g., enhancing project readiness and engaging consultants for project implementation \nsupport. SRCIP is also relevant to the Regional Cooperation Strategy in South Asia, 2011\u2013\n20157 aimed at improving subregional connectivity and promoting intraregional trade.  \n \n13.  The framework financing  agreement  (FFA)8 details  the  road map, strategic  context, \npolicy  framework,  and  investment  program.  The  MFF  is  the  modality  best  suited  for  the \ninvestment program, which has multiple executing agencies, by allowing ADB to enter into a \nsustained and planned, yet flexible partnership, with the central government for a long-term \ninvestment  in  regional  connectivity\u2014in  parallel  with  continued  support  for  implementation \nefficiency improvement.9 Different levels of progress in project preparation by different agencies \ncan  be  well  managed  by  the  phased  approach  of  the  MFF.  Lessons  learned  for  a  new \ncontracting  initiative,  including  performance-based  maintenance,  can  be  incorporated  in \ntranche 2. Preparation can be undertaken under tranche 1 for tranche 2 subprojects and a \nplanned  central  government  program  to  develop  regional  connectivity.  A  solid  pipeline  of \nregional connectivity projects encourages contractors to invest in projects in remote areas.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n14.  The  impact  will  be  increased  domestic  and  regional  trade  through  NB-NER.  The \noutcome will be improved road connectivity and efficiency of the NB-NER international trade \ncorridor. \n \n                                                \n6   ADB. 2013.

Outputs \n \n15.  Road improvement for regional connectivity. SRCIP will rehabilitate and upgrade \nabout 500 km of regional connectivity roads, which are part of the Asian Highways, SAARC \nHighway Corridors, or their alternate routes. It will cover both national highways and state roads. \nThe upgrading will be mainly two-laning with paved shoulders, together with safety features \nincluding construction of overpasses at busy junctions and bypasses for smooth traffic. Some \nsections will be widened to four lanes to serve future traffic. Performance-based maintenance \nwill be undertaken for 5 years after construction. The engineer will be engaged for engineering, \nprocurement, and construction (EPC) contracts; and the construction supervision consultants for \nitem-rate contracts. In addition, the implementation support consultant (ISC) will be engaged to \nsupport the executing agencies in (i) external safeguard monitoring, (ii) third-party quality check \non  maintenance,  (iii)  road  safety  audit,  (iv)  financial  management,  and  (v)  preparation  for \nsubsequent submission of periodic financing requests to ADB. \n \n16.  Capacity  development  and  implementation  support  of  Manipur  Public  Works \nDepartment. SRCIP will provide capacity development of MPWD, together with implementation \nsupport,  especially  in  strengthening  financial  management  systems  and  managing  larger \ncontracts  with  performance-based  maintenance.  This  will  initially  focus  on  subproject \nimplementation in Manipur, and roll over to the state road network systems. \n \n17.  Tranche 1 outputs. Tranche 1 will adopt the sector modality to finance (i) upgrading of \nroad subprojects totaling about 300 km, including implementation support, given the highest \npriority because of their significant regional impacts; and (ii) MPWD capacity development and \nimplementation support. The road subprojects include (i) 37 km of Asian Highway 2 connecting \nBangladesh, India, and Nepal, and 97 km of Asian Highway 48 connecting Bangladesh, Bhutan, \nand India, and Bangladesh; and (ii) about 130 km of state roads extending the connection with \nMyanmar. The first two subprojects (Asian Highway 2 and Asian Highway 48), which have the \nmost challenging features, have been appraised. Other road subprojects will be appraised for \nADB approval during implementation of tranche 1, following the selection criteria and approval \nprocess (according to the FFA, schedule 4). All subproject roads are of a similar nature to the \nlast-mile connectivity. \n  \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans        \n  \n18.  The  investment  program  is  estimated  to  cost  $761.6  million,  including  five-year \nperformance-based maintenance, taxes and duties, physical and price contingencies, interest, \nand other charges during implementation (Table 1). \n \n19.  The central government has requested an MFF in an amount of up to $500.0 million \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance a part of the investment program.10 The \nMFF will consist of several tranches, subject to government\u2019s submission of related periodic \nfinancing requests, execution of the related loan and project agreements for each tranche, and \nfulfillment of terms and conditions and undertakings set forth in the FFA. For each tranche under \nthe  MFF,  MoRTH  will  receive  a  portion  of the  ADB  loan  proceeds through  the  budgetary \nallocation. Under current policies of the central government, the state government of Manipur \nwill receive 90% of the remaining portion as a grant from the central government as Manipur is a \nspecial category state. The financing plan is in Table 2. \n                                                \n10  Financing includes part of customs and duties amounting to about $88 million. The estimated expenditure is not \nexcessive (15% of ADB loan resources) and will apply only with respect to ADB-financed expenditures. \n ", "5 \n \n20.  The first tranche of the MFF will be financed by a loan of $300 million from ADB\u2019s \nordinary  capital  resources.  The  loan  will  use  a  sector  modality;  and  has  a  25-year  term, \nincluding a grace period of 5 years, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility,11 a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements.  \n \nTable 1: Investment Program ($ million) \nItem  Tranche 1  Tranche 2  Total \n      (2014)  (2015)    \nA.

MoRTH  will  adopt  e-procurement  for  international \ncompetitive bidding works packages. Distribution of bidding documents and submission of bids \nwill be done only electronically. The World Bank has adopted the same approach for projects \nwith MoRTH. The e-procurement system has been in use since about 2010 with the National \nHighways Authority of India, MoRTH, and many state government departments.

The recommendations of the road safety audit were incorporated in the \ndesign. As part of road sector reform initiatives, national highway stretches will be taken up \nunder the EPC mode, including five-year performance-based maintenance, so that a part of the \ndesign  and  completion  risk  is  transferred  on  to  the  EPC  contractor  to  gain  design  and \nimplementation efficiencies. State highways will be contracted as item rate contracts using \nADB\u2019s  standard  bidding  documents  with  modification  to  include  performance-based \nmaintenance. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n24.  The economic assessment for subprojects (Asian Highways 2 and 48) was carried out in  \n ", "7 \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects.13 The  principal \nbenefits  calculated  are  savings  in  vehicle  operating  costs  and  travel  time.  The  estimated \neconomic internal rates of return are 22.4% for Asian Highway 2 and 16.3% for Asian Highway \n48. The sensitivity analysis indicates that the project roads have economic internal rates of \nreturn  above  12%  even  with  adverse  variation  in  costs  and  benefits,  so  the  proposed \nimprovements are economically viable. In addition to the quantified benefits, the project will \nbring  significant  benefits  to  overall  regional  trade  among  SASEC  countries.  Incremental \nrecurrent costs associated with all possible subprojects under SRCIP are estimated at about \n1.5% of the current MoRTH and 3.3% of the MPWD maintenance budget on an annual basis, \nwhich  are  likely  to  be  provided  by  both  agencies  without  difficulties.  The  initial  five-year \nmaintenance has been budgeted under the investment program.  \n \nC.  Governance \n \n25.  Financial management. A financial management assessment indicated that MoRTH \nand  MPWD  have  adequate  capacity  in  financial  management  for  ADB-financed  projects. \nMoRTH has established financial management systems in the regional offices and regional pay \nand accounts offices to account for and report on the project expenditure. MoRTH\u2019s capacity is \nbeing strengthened by the World Bank, including development of enterprise resource planning \nsystems and a financial management manual. MPWD\u2019s capacity will be strengthened by ISC, \nespecially in initial computerization of financial management systems and strengthening the \naudit review mechanism. The investment program will also provide training and support to \nMPWD on ADB procedures and financial management systems.    \n  \n26.  Procurement  and  anticorruption.  Contracts  financed  by  ADB  will  follow  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time), include a policy statement on \navoiding  corrupt  practices,  and  ensure  compliance  with  core  labor  standards.  Information \nrelating to the investment program will be published on the MoRTH and MPWD websites. The \ngovernment  has  started  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation  systems  for  government \ndepartments and ministries (including MoRTH) to assess key governance indicators. Parliament \nis considering bills on public procurement, whistleblower protection, and prevention of money \nlaundering.  MoRTH  and  states  have  started  road  sector-specific  initiatives  such  as  the \nintroduction of a longer defect liability period and  new procurement modes such as EPC, \nperformance-based  maintenance  and  e-procurement.  MoRTH-wide  enterprise  resource \nplanning, supported by the World Bank, and computerization of financial managements systems \nin state road agencies, supported by ADB, will also help enhance good governance. ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the \ncentral government, the state government of Manipur, and state government of West Bengal; \nand MoRTH, MPWD, and the West Bengal Public Works Department (WBPWD). The specific \npolicy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the FAM.  \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n27.  For  Asian  Highway  2  and  Asian  Highway  48,  the  subproject  impact  area  can  be \ncharacterized by a predominance of traditional farming, and lack of road connectivity at the \ndesired  level\u2014causing  limited  access  to  health  care,  educational  institutions,  commercial \nfacilities, and government development agencies. Respondents engaged during the poverty and \nsocial survey expressed that they could not reap the benefits of locational advantages because \nof inadequate road connectivity despite proximity to bordering nations and other Indian states. \n                                                \n13 ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n ", "8 \nHalf of the working population is self-employed in trade and business, including cross-border \ntrade. Agriculture, non-farm labor, and the service sector each account for an equal proportion \nof workers while about 11% are engaged by tea gardens. The work participation ratio is 37% for \nmen and 31% for women of working age. A more efficient road network will provide stronger \nlinks between remote, poor regions, and more developed markets both within India and at a \nsubregional  level,  and  thus  improve  the  socioeconomic  situation  and  enhance  poverty \nreduction. The improvement will directly benefit about 1.3 million people in the project area. \n \n28.  Gender. Women in Asian Highway 2 and Asian Highway 48 project areas are mainly \ninvolved in household work, cultivation, working in tea estates, and other farming activities. \nWomen indicated that improved road conditions and connectivity will provide better access to \nhealth services, higher levels of education, economic opportunities, and social interactions. \nMitigation and proactive key actions for tranche 1 include (i) constructing over 30 km of paved, \nraised sidewalk in urban areas that will be highly beneficial to pedestrians, elderly, women, and \nchildren; (ii) encouraging civil works contractors to engage women workers as wage laborers \nand  ensuring  equal  pay  for  equal  work;  and  (iii)  providing  awareness-raising  seminars for \ncontractors, construction workers, and women in the project areas on HIV/AIDS, health and \nhygiene,  road  safety,  and  human  trafficking.  The  implementing  agencies  and  project \nimplementation units (PIUs) will monitor the implementation. \n \n29.  HIV/AIDS and trafficking. The Asian Highway 2 and Asian Highway 48 subproject area \nis characterized by increasing rates of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections, with \nconcentrated epidemics. Based on the assessment, the National AIDS Control Organization of \nthe Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and the State AIDS Prevention and Control Society \nare tasked to provide medical and health services, public awareness raising and social sector \nservices, and monitoring. The state governments have set up the District AIDS Prevention and \nControl Unit to provide more targeted interventions to high-risk groups, and an integrated and \naugmented system of prevention, care, support, and treatment at the district level. Based on \nexisting government initiatives, mitigating measures are in place to address all health and social \nrisks  and  impacts  associated  with  infrastructure  development  in  the  project  area.  The \nimplementing  agency  and  PIU  will  ensure  that  civil  works  contractors  conduct  awareness \nprograms  in  HIV/AIDS,  human  trafficking,  and  child  labor  at  construction  camp  sites  and \nworkplaces. All contracts will have clauses on these initiatives, and the state governments will \nmonitor compliance during implementation. A nongovernment organization (NGO) will conduct \nawareness programs in HIV/AIDS, and human trafficking in project-affected communities. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n30.  Involuntary resettlement. Tranche 1 is categorized A for involuntary resettlement, in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  The  investment  program  was \ndeveloped  to  minimize  the  need  for  land  acquisition  and  involuntary  resettlement.  Two \ncombined resettlement and indigenous peoples plans have been prepared for Asian Highway 2 \nand Asian Highway 48. These were approved by ADB and disclosed on the ADB website. A \ntotal of 9.05 hectares of private land will need to be acquired  at replacement cost. Some \n4,132 households will be affected, occupying 3,578 structures. A total of 489 households will \nexperience physical displacement, 1,944 households will experience economic displacement, \nand 354 households will experience both physical and economic displacement. The displaced \nhouseholds will be entitled to compensation for the loss of land and structures at replacement \ncost, shifting cost, and other income restoration assistance. Resettlement for the two roads is \nestimated to cost about $12.5 million. The implementing agency and/or the PIU is experienced \nwith the land acquisition process and implement the land acquisition. The PIU will be staffed \n ", "9 \nwith  experienced  social  safeguard  personnel,  with  a  resettlement  officer  to  oversee  each \naffected district. An experienced NGO will be engaged by the PIU to implement the resettlement \nplan for each subproject. A resettlement framework was approved and disclosed on the ADB \nwebsite for the investment program, under which a resettlement plan will be prepared by the \nrelevant  executing  agency  for  each  subsequent  subproject,  with  resettlement  impact,  and \nsubmitted to ADB for approval. \n \n31.  Indigenous peoples. Tranche 1 is categorized C for indigenous peoples. In the Asian \nHighway 2 and Asian Highway 48 project areas, 135 indigenous peoples households will be \nimpacted  by  involuntary  resettlement.  The  census  found  that  these  households  are  not \ndistinctive because they are integrated with the dominant population of the project area. Tribal \ngroups in the subproject areas freely interact with the outside community. These groups have \nnuclear families, and are open to new ideas like family planning and formal education. Social \nimpact assessments confirm that the socioeconomic impacts caused by the subprojects will not \nbe  different  for  these  people  when  compared  with  the  remainder  of  the  population.  Two \ncombined  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples  plans  have  been  prepared  for  the  two \nsubprojects.  Adequate  compensation  provisions  are  made  to  mitigate  adverse  impacts  on \nindigenous peoples. An indigenous peoples planning framework was prepared. In accordance \nwith  the  framework,  if  any  significant  impacts  on  indigenous  peoples  are  identified  in  the \nsubsequent subprojects, the relevant executing agency will prepare an indigenous peoples plan \nand submit it to ADB for approval.  \n \n32.  Environment. Tranche 1 is categorized category A for environment since one of the \nsubproject roads passes through a national park with critical habitat areas. A consolidated \nenvironmental impact assessment (EIA) for both Asian Highway 2 and Asian Highway 48 has \nbeen  prepared. The  draft  EIA  was  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website  on  9  August  2013.  An \nenvironmental assessment and review framework (EARF) was prepared to guide compliance \nwith environmental safeguard requirements in accordance with the provisions of the Ministry of \nEnvironment and Forests, the central government, and the Safeguard Policy Statement in the \nsubsequent subprojects. Anticipated significant environmental impacts from the two subprojects \nentail disruption of wildlife migratory routes, disturbance to wildlife, and removal of a large \nnumber of trees. Mitigation and environmental enhancement measures, including modifications \nto  the  technical  design  of  the  road  to  address  these  impacts  and  ensure  no  net  loss  of \nbiodiversity, have been included in the subproject designs. Other anticipated impacts entail \ntypical road construction-related issues such as generation of dust, noise, exhaust, waste from \nconstruction and worker camps, water contamination, occupational health and safety, erosion, \nand siltation. Mitigation measures to address these have been included in the environmental \nmanagement plan, which will be implemented by the contractor. Meaningful consultations have \nbeen held with affected persons and other key stakeholders, such as national park officials and \nthe World Wildlife Fund, while preparing the EIA. Technical recommendations from park officials \nand the World Wildlife Fund have been incorporated in the EIA. Concerns of affected persons \nand relevant stakeholders will continue to be addressed during project implementation through \nthe grievance redress mechanism proposed in the EIA. \n \n33.  The environmental capacity of the executing and implementing agencies will need to be \nstrengthened during project implementation. An authorized officer for environmental safeguards \nwill be appointed at the executing agency level and an environmental focal person at the \nimplementing  agency  and/or  PIU  level.  The  PIU  will  carry  out  internal  monitoring  of  the \nimplementation of environment safeguards while the ISC will perform external monitoring. For \nenvironment category A and B subprojects, another external monitoring agency will be engaged \nto  conduct  third-party  monitoring.  An  initial  coordination-cum-training  workshop  will  be \n ", "10 \nconducted by the implementing agency, with technical support from ADB. The ISC or ADB will \nconduct on-the-job training as necessary during project implementation.  \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n34.  The key risks are delays in implementatioin and sustainability (Table 4). Other risks and \nmitigating measures are described in the risk assessment and risk management plan.14  \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nProject  Advance actions taken to ensure project readiness. PIUs engaged safeguard focal persons. \nimplementation  Contract packaging was made to attract qualified contractors. MoRTH will set up PIU for \ndelay  national highways in Manipur to supplement MPWD capacity and streamline the decision-\nmaking process. MPWD increased its staff for the investment program. \nSafeguard  Adverse impacts of land acquisition, social, and environmental impacts have been minimized \ncompliance  by undertaking all engineering measures and consultation. Works contracts will be awarded \nonly after substantially completing safeguard requirements. Consultants will be engaged for \nimplementation support. Before commencing construction, a due diligence mission will be \nfielded to confirm that rights-of-way to be handed over to contractors are free of encumbrances; \nand create awareness among project authorities of ADB\u2019s social safeguard requirements. \nSustainability  A five-year performance-based maintenance will be adopted. The appropriate budget was \n  provided under the investment program.
