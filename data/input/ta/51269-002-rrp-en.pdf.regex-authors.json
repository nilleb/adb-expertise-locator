THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  the  additional  financing  of  the  Microenterprise \nDevelopment Project.1  \n \n2.  The ongoing project comprises (i) a financial intermediary loan of $50 million from the \nordinary capital resources of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for a credit line implemented by \nthe Palli Karma-Sahayak Foundation (PKSF)\u2014an apex development finance organization set up \nby the government\u2014through its partner microfinance institutions (MFIs); and (ii) a technical \nassistance (TA) grant of $500,000 to support microenterprise development. The entire $50 million \nloan has been disbursed to the PKSF, which has then disbursed it to 39,580 microenterprises \nthrough its 77 partner organizations, with an average loan size of $1,493, generating 91,430 rural \njobs.2 The report and recommendation of the President for the current project is accessible from \nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2. \n \n3.  The additional financing will scale up the ongoing project and help restore the economic \nactivities of microenterprises, severely impacted by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n  \n4.  The COVID-19 pandemic has severely affected the lives and livelihoods of people in \nBangladesh. Many formal and informal workers in rural and urban areas have lost their livelihoods \nbecause of the pandemic and its associated economic shocks. Women have been heavily hit, as \nthey  are  often  entrepreneurs  and  wage  earners  in  agriculture,  fisheries,  livestock,  small \nmanufacturing, food processing, services, and trading. People living marginally above the poverty \nline are being pushed back into poverty as alternative employment opportunities are not available. \nGovernment support for wages to selected industry workers and cash subsidies to the urban poor, \nthough  extremely  helpful  as  a  stopgap  measure,  cannot  be  sustained  over  long  periods. \nEmployment generation, especially in rural areas, needs to be supported. \n \n5.  Microenterprises,  with  their  large  employment  potential,  are  ideal  for  job  creation.3 \nHowever, they  are facing  working capital  constraints,  supply  disruptions,  and low  demand \nbecause of the COVID-19 economic slowdown; and their liquidity is severely constrained.4 This \nis affecting employment, production, and revenues. Women entrepreneurs who have experienced \nbusiness losses do not have sufficient liquid assets, personal savings, or access to finance, so \nthey have been forced to shut down or drastically scale down business operations.5 The PKSF \n \n1  ADB. 2018. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan and Technical \nAssistance Grant to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Microenterprise Development Project. Manila. \n2  The project supported 32,576 microenterprises in the first phase of loan disbursement by February 2020. An \nadditional Tk1,064.34 million in loans was provided to 7,004 microenterprises and 225 repeat microenterprise \nborrowers from revolving funds (loan recovery) up to August 2020. The loan recovery rate was 99.4%. \n3  According to Bangladesh\u2019s Economic Census of 2013, about 89% of the 7.8 million economic establishments in \nBangladesh are microenterprises, including cottage businesses; and 75% of these microenterprises are in rural \nareas, providing local employment. \n4  An evaluation by the PKSF of the impact of COVID-19 on its operations, covering 160 microenterprises in 23 districts, \nfound that 99.4% of microenterprises reported a decline in sales because of COVID-19. \n5   A study found that 65% of women entrepreneurs had no income from February to June 2020 during the lockdown. \nWomen entrepreneurs reported a 67% decline in their personal income after March. One-third of them had to shut \ntheir businesses during the pandemic. BRAC. 2020. Situation of Women CMSME Entrepreneurs and Informal Sector \nWorkers: A Rapid Assessment and Quest for Recovery from Losses Induced by COVID-19 Pandemic. Dhaka. \n ", "2 \nestimates that about $170 million of additional financing is needed for post-COVID-19 economic \nrestoration and to meet microenterprises\u2019 demand for working capital.6 The additional financing \nwill help retain businesses and protect the employment of affected microenterprises.  \n \n6.  Performance of the ongoing project. The ongoing project is performing well as (i) it is \nrated on track in the project performance rating system; (ii) safeguards are complied with; (iii) the \ndelivery of expected outputs, including the implementation of the gender action plan, is rated \nsuccessful; and (iv) risk management is rated successful, as all risks in the risk assessment and \nrisk management plan have been managed successfully.7 Women borrowers comprise 78% of \nthe  microenterprises  receiving  financing.  The  TA  is  supporting  the  PKSF  and  its  partner \norganizations to expand MFIs\u2019 microenterprise development services and financing; and to pilot \ntest new technology through innovative, mobile-based microenterprise financing applications.8 It \nis providing MFIs with skills for risk assessment, credit appraisal, and financial management for \nmicroenterprise  finance,  as  well  as  increasing  capacity  in  microenterprise  lending  by \nimplementing  gender-inclusive  finance  guidelines.  The  project  is  also  strengthening \nenvironmental and social screening systems for the PKSF and its partner organizations. Good \nprogress has been made to develop a medium-term institutional strengthening and financing \nstrategy for the PKSF, including retaining its competitiveness and relevance.  \n \n7.  Suitability of using the additional financing modality. The proposed project meets the \neligibility criteria for additional financing. The overall project is (i) technically feasible, economically \nviable, and financially sound; (ii) accorded high priority by the government; (iii) consistent with the \nproject\u2019s development objective; and (iv) consistent with ADB\u2019s country operations business plan \nfor Bangladesh, 2021\u20132023.9 The proposed additional financing is strongly linked to the ongoing \nproject\u2019s outputs and outcome, uses the same design and implementation arrangements, and \nbuilds on the lessons learned and due diligence of the ongoing project. \n \n8.  Strategic context. The project is aligned with the government\u2019s National Sustainable \nDevelopment Strategy, 2010\u20132021, which promotes micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises \nto generate job opportunities.10 It is aligned with the operational priorities of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 \nto address remaining poverty and reduce inequalities, accelerate progress in gender equity, and \npromote rural development.11 It is also aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2016\u2013\n2020, which identifies improving rural livelihoods and expanding employment opportunities as key \npriority areas.12 The project will complement support from other development partners.13 \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n9.  The impact and outcome of the project remain unchanged. The project is aligned with the \nfollowing impact: growth of microenterprises expanded to provide forward linkages to agriculture \nand generate job opportunities. The project outcome is microenterprises\u2019 access to MFI financing \n \n6   The PKSF estimates that about 1.7 million microenterprises supported by them have lost an average of 10%\u201315% \nof their capital ($415 million) because of COVID-19. The PKSF contributes an average of 40% of a microenterprise\u2019s \ncapital, which amounts to $170 million. \n7   The cumulative loan recovery rate for the ongoing project is 99.4%. \n8   The ongoing TA will be topped up to support the additional financing project. \n9   ADB. 2020.

It will support microenterprises affected by COVID-19. The overall project focuses on \ngender equity, and targets a loan portfolio with at least 70% women borrowers.14 The project \noutputs remain unchanged, while performance indicators will be updated. The revised design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. The additional financing project comprises three outputs. \n \n10.  Output 1: Funding to microfinance institutions for microenterprise loans expanded. \nThis output will provide a credit line to the PKSF for relending to its partner organizations to ease \nshort-term microenterprise financing constraints. It aims to provide loans to at least 30,000 \nCOVID-19 affected microenterprises who are eligible members of partner organizations, 70% of \nwhom are female.15 The PKSF\u2019s microenterprise total loans outstanding will be Tk24 billion, \nalmost double the 2017 baseline, with at least Tk5 billion for COVID-19 affected microenterprises. \nThe partner organizations\u2019 microenterprise loan portfolio outstanding will reach Tk160 billion, \nmore than double the 2017 baseline, of which at least 70% are for female borrowers. To address \nmedium-term financing constraints,  a medium-term institutional strengthening  and  financing \nstrategy for the PKSF was developed under the ongoing project. This is under discussion, and \nthe PKSF will adopt the agreed recommendations. \n \n11.  Output 2: Microfinance institutions\u2019 capacity in microenterprise lending enhanced. \nThis  output  will  enhance MFI capacity in microenterprise  lending  by  implementing  gender-\ninclusive finance guidelines, improved under the ongoing project. Training (including refresher) \nwill be provided to 120 partner organizations using the microenterprise finance operational \nguidelines developed under the ongoing project. The guidelines include methodologies for the \ncredit appraisal, pricing, terms and conditions, and financial and portfolio management and \nmonitoring of MFIs\u2019 microenterprise finance operations, including risk management. The mobile-\nbased microenterprise financing application\u2014pilot tested for selected partner organizations for \nactivities such as loan applications, appraisal, disbursement, and collection\u2014will be extended to \nthree more partner organizations and 10,000 additional microenterprise borrowers, of whom at \nleast 70% are female. Legal and regulatory consultation, application development or adoption, \nguidelines and manual development, and partner organization and client training will continue. \n \n12.  Output  3:  Microfinance  institutions\u2019  microenterprise  development  support \nextended. This output will enhance access to wider and upscale markets for an additional 1,000 \nmicroenterprise borrowers, at least 70% of whom are women. It will expand the identification of \nanother three microenterprise products for potential expansion; and support microenterprise \ncluster development by assisting in quality control, branding, packaging, and marketing. Priority \nwill be given to female microenterprise borrowers. In addition, this output will extend the support \ninitiated in the ongoing project for linking microenterprises to e-commerce platforms. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n13.  The proposed project will alleviate the financing needs of at least 30,000 COVID-19 \naffected  microenterprises  by  providing  cheaper  financing  terms.  On  ADB\u2019s  request,  the \ngovernment and the PKSF have agreed to reduce the onlending rate by at least 25% (from the \ncurrent 24% to a maximum of 18% per year). The loan will help the PKSF to leverage $35 million \n \n14 IFC. 2016. Study on Mapping the Market Potential and Accelerating Finance for Women Entrepreneurs in \nBangladesh estimates that women entrepreneurs own only 7.2% of the 8 million enterprises in Bangladesh (of which \n99.9% are small and micro). \n15 Criteria for the selection of COVID-19 affected microenterprises will be (i) microenterprises in small manufacturing, \nagriculture, fisheries, and livestock whose average operating capital decreased by 10% or more from pre-March 2020 \nlevels between 30 March and 30 June 2020; or (ii) microenterprises in the services sector whose average sales \ndecreased by 20% or more from pre-March levels between 30 March and 30 June 2020. \n ", "4 \nfrom commercial banks, $50 million from client savings, and $35 million from cumulative surplus \nand equity of partner organizations. At least Tk5 billion of the PKSF\u2019s microenterprise loans \noutstanding will be for COVID-19 affected microenterprises. The additional financing will inject \nliquidity into the rural economy; and help retain businesses and jobs for microenterprises. At least \n70% of microenterprise borrowers will be female, and 90,000 jobs will be protected or created. \nADB  financing  will  be  used  for  agriculture,  fisheries,  livestock,  small  manufacturing,  food \nprocessing, services, and trading, which are badly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The \ndevelopment of clusters could also help firms in the regional value chain to address supply chain \ndisruptions caused by the pandemic. Moreover, the project will promote a shift in the MFI business \nmodel to digital transactions, which are more efficient and easier and safer for borrowers to use \nin the post-COVID-19 scenario. \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n14.  The overall project is estimated to cost $125.0 million, including additional financing of \n$50.0 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources (Table 1). The financing plan is in Table 2. \n \nTable 1: Summary Cost Estimates  \n($ million) \nCurrent  Additional \nItem  Total \nFinancing  Financing \nA.   Base Cost        \n  1.

The government has requested a regular loan of $50 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period \nof 5 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. Based on the straight-line \nmethod, the average loan maturity is 15.25 years, and the maturity premium payable to ADB is \n0.10% per year.  \n  \n16.  The government will relend the ADB loan proceeds to the PKSF in local currency under a \nmutually agreed subsidiary loan agreement. The government will bear the foreign exchange risks. \n \n17.  The  PKSF  will  relend  to  selected  partner  organizations  for  financing  eligible \nmicroenterprise borrowers. The relending rates from the PKSF to partner organizations are 7.5% \nper year for partner organizations with loans outstanding above Tk1.0 billion; 6.0% for partner \n ", "5 \norganizations  with  loans  outstanding  of  Tk0.5  billion\u2013Tk1.0  billion;  and  5.0%  for  partner \norganizations with loans outstanding below Tk0.5 billion. PKSF loans to partner organizations will \nhave a 3-year maturity, including a 6-month grace period. Loans to microenterprise borrowers \nrange from Tk50,000 to Tk1 million, with a maturity of up to 2 years. The repayment schedule will \ndepend on microenterprises\u2019 cash flow pattern. The maximum interest rate for the sub-loans is \n18% per year based on a declining balance. Loans repaid by partner organizations will be \nrevolved on the same terms by the PKSF.   \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  The implementation arrangements remain unchanged. These are summarized in Table 3 \nand described in detail in the project administration manual.16 ADB will disburse the loan proceeds \nfollowing its Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed \narrangements agreed between the government and ADB. \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  December 2020\u2013June 2023  \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2022  \nEstimated loan closing date  30 June 2023 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Project steering committee \nSecretary of Financial Institutions Division, Ministry of Finance (chair) \nEconomic Relations Division representative, Finance Division representative, \nFinancial Institutions Division representative, PKSF representative, and other \nrelevant stakeholders (members) \n(ii)  Executing agency  Bank and Financial Institutions Division, Ministry of Finance  \n(iii)  Key implementing  PKSF \nagencies \n(iv) Implementation unit  PKSF, 3 full-time staff  \nDisbursement  The  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  following  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements \nagreed between the government and ADB.  \nADB = Asian Development Bank, PKSF = Palli Karma-Sahayak Foundation. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Summary Due Diligence Results \n \n19.  A summary of the due diligence assessments for the proposed additional financing is \npresented in Table 4. The full due diligence assessments are accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Due Diligence Assessments \nArea of \nSummary of Assessment \nAssessment \nTechnical   ADB assessed the selected partner organizations\u2019 technical capacity to make microenterprise \nloans. Partner organizations have established procedures for loan appraisal, loan sanction, and \nportfolio monitoring and reporting for microenterprise loans. To support further improvement in \nMFI capacity for microenterprise financing, the project will continue to build capacities in the \nPKSF and its partner organizations through the ongoing TA.   \nEconomic and  Microenterprises, which typically have short cash cycles, were severely affected by supply chain \nfinancial viability  disruptions and weakening demand caused by the nationwide lockdown aimed at containing \n \n16 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "6 \nArea of \nSummary of Assessment \nAssessment \nthe COVID-19 pandemic. The project will directly benefit at least 70,000 microenterprises in \nBangladesh, of which 70% are female borrowers, by providing a reliable and affordable \ninstitutional source of finance. In doing so, the project greatly reduces the beneficiaries\u2019 fund \ncosts and promotes the efficient allocation of finance, thus yielding a higher rate of return to the \nbeneficiaries\u2019 microenterprise investments. \nSustainability  The project is expected to enhance the sustainability of the PKSF\u2019s operations, both financially \nand institutionally. The ADB loan will provide a credit line to sustain PKSF\u2019s funding to \nmicroenterprises, and the ongoing TA will provide institutional strengthening to help the PKSF \nexpand and sustain its operations. ADB\u2019s long term funds will help the PKSF mobilize greater \nprivate sector finance to support sectors affected by COVID-19 by protecting and creating jobs.  \nGovernance  ADB requirements and policies on financial management and procurement measures, and \nenvironmental and social safeguards, were discussed and agreed with the government and the \nPKSF and incorporated in the project design. The specific requirements are described in the \nPAM.a Procurement will follow the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to \ntime) and the Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to \ntime). Procurement will be undertaken by the individual beneficiary; fitness for purpose can be \nachieved by using established private sector and commercial practices. \nThe financial management risk is moderate. Based on financial due diligence, the PKSF needs \nto strengthen its capacity\u2014particularly its management information system. The financial \nmanagement  assessment,  which  includes  a  financial  analysis  of  partner  organizations, \nindicated that the PKSF has sufficient experience in managing similar projects for ADB and \nother  international  development  partners  and  has  the  necessary  financial  management \narrangements.  The  capacity  of  the  PKSF\u2019s  partner  organizations  will  continue  to  be \nstrengthened under the ongoing TA to improve the quality of their audit and financial statements, \nand portfolio management practices.  \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with \nthe government and the PKSF. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM.a \nPoverty, social,  The  project  will  support  microenterprises  that  can  be  key  drivers  of  rural  growth  and \nand gender   employment. The development of microenterprises fosters growth through forward linkages, \npromotes product markets, and contributes to poverty alleviation by creating and protecting self- \nand wage-employment opportunities, which can significantly mitigate the impact of the COVID-\n19 pandemic. The ongoing project has already created more than 90,000 jobs. The estimated \nmonthly income of microenterprise workers in manufacturing, processing, or services ranges \nfrom  Tk4,000  for  part-time  workers  to  Tk15,000  for  full-time  workers.  Considering  that \nBangladesh\u2019s annual per capita gross national income in FY2017 was Tk127,401, the project is \nexpected to contribute to poverty reduction by increasing rural household incomes. The project \nhas a strong focus on developing women-led microenterprises and will develop MFI capacity in \nconducting women-focused microenterprise financing. It is classified gender equity as a theme.b \nSafeguards  The  project  will  be  implemented  following  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009). \nEnvironment  (category  FI  treated  as  C).
