The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  initiated  the  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic \nCooperation (CAREC) Program in 1997. The countries participating in the Program currently \nconsist of Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, People\u2019s Republic of China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, \nMongolia,  Tajikistan,  and  Uzbekistan.  ADB  has  a  strong  relationship  with  each  of  these \ncountries and serves as program Secretariat for CAREC.1  \n \n2.  In  October  2004,  the  Senior  Officials\u2019  Meeting  (SOM)  of  CAREC  highlighted  in  its \nprogress report to the third Ministerial Conference (MC) the importance of capacity-building to \nenhance country ownership of the CAREC Program, and welcomed ADB\u2019s support in this area. \nMinisters at the fourth MC in November 2005 further indicated that capacity-building should \nfocus on strengthening the national focal points (NFPs), conducting training workshops and \nstudy tours concerning international best practices for regional cooperation, and information \nexchange and research networks.2 \n \n3.  ADB recognized in its CAREC Regional Cooperation Strategy and Program the need to \nincrease technical assistance (TA) for capacity-building in CAREC participating countries.3 This \nposition goes along with the thrust of the enhanced poverty reduction strategy (PRS), which \nelevated capacity development to one of the five priority themes of the PRS.4 \n \n4.  On 25 March 2005, the People\u2019s Republic of China Poverty Reduction and Regional \nCooperation Fund (PRC Fund) was established, with a view, among others, to strengthening the \ncapacity  of  developing  member  countries  (DMCs)  to  reduce  poverty  through  regional \ncooperation.5 This TA was proposed by ADB's Regional Cooperation Committee6 for financing \nby the PRC Fund, which has endorsed the proposal and earmarked for it the amount of \n$400,000. The TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.7 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n5.  The CAREC Program operates through its overall institutional framework (OIF), which \nconsists  of  (i)  an  annual  MC  that  provides  overall  guidance  and  directions,  (ii)  SOM  that \ncoordinates  cross-sectoral  issues  and  prepares  for  the  MC,  (iii)  sectoral  coordinating \ncommittees at the operational level that coordinate sectorwide issues and implementation, and \n(iv) a NFP in each participating country to ensure effective coordination among government \nagencies and other concerned parties. The capacity of government officials involved in the OIF \nwas found critical to the success of regional initiatives under the CAREC Program.8 \n \n                                                 \n1  Apart from ADB, five other multilateral institutions also provide assistance to regional cooperation in Central Asia \nwith CAREC as a platform: (i) European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, (ii) International Monetary \nFund, (iii) Islamic Development Bank, (iv) United Nations Development Programme, and (v) World Bank.  \n2  Fourth Ministerial Conference on CAREC. 2005.

People\u2019s Republic of China Regional Cooperation and Poverty Reduction Fund. Manila (R78-05).  \n6  Acting as the PRC Fund Committee in accordance with Appendix 1, R78-05 (footnote 5). \n7  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 19 July 2005. \n8  This has been one of the major lessons learned from a TA completed under the CAREC Program. (ADB. 2004. \nTechnical Assistance Completion Report on Regional Economic Cooperation in Central Asia [Phase II]. Manila \n[IN.128-04]). \n ", "2   \n6.  Currently, there is an ongoing TA, i.e. TA 6158,9 focusing on capacity-building under the \nCAREC  Program.  Major  reasons  that  underlay  TA  6158  are  as  follows:  (i)  preparation  of \nintercountry projects and programs is inherently more complex and requires a multicountry \nperspective; (ii) progress and success in regional cooperation hinge on the capacity of officials \nof the participating countries to identify and address cross-country policy issues and integrate \nthese  into  the  domestic  development  strategy;  (iii)  high-level  forum  and  networking  are \nimportant in fostering dialogue and sustaining mutual trust on regional cooperation; and (iv) in \nview of the vital role of the NFPs in coordinating and championing the regional cooperation \ninitiatives within the administrations, they need to be given targeted and individually tailored \ntraining. The purpose of TA 6158 was to strengthen the capacity for regional cooperation so that \nparticipating countries can assume greater roles and responsibilities in planning, implementing, \nand coordinating the CAREC Program. To this end, TA 6158 is set to finance the development \nof a comprehensive capacity-building assessment plan and to support a series of activities \nunder the following core components: (i) strengthening the NFPs, (ii) training national officials \ninvolved in regional cooperation, and (iii) enhancing information exchange and understanding of \nthe benefits of regional cooperation. \n  \n7.  The needs assessment undertaken under TA 6158 was presented to the SOM in April \n2005.  Major  findings  based  on  consultations  with  CAREC  countries  included  (i)  common \npriorities identified for capacity-building;10 (ii) special interests or priorities of individual countries, \nand (iii) possible themes/actions of capacity-building. As noted in the needs assessment note, \nthe wish list of capacity-building themes and actions could not be fully accommodated by TA \n6158 with its limited resources of $950,000. Using a \u201cbuilding-block\u201d approach, some of the \ncapacity-building components will clearly have to be financed by additional resources.  \n \n8.  The PRC Fund provides an opportunity to scale up and complement TA 6158 and to \ncontribute  to  full  achievement  of  its  purpose  for  CAREC  capacity-building.  In  fact, \ncomplementary but distinct use of the PRC Fund from ADB\u2019s core financing sources has also \nbeen one of the requirements of the Fund. Apart from this, other basic principles as set forth in \nthe Board paper on the PRC Fund will be followed in the design and implementation of the TA: \n(i) alignment of the programs with the Regional Cooperation Strategy and Program and its \nupdate; (ii) use of DMC expertise to the extent possible; and (iii) the requirement that the PRC \nFund be used in the most cost-effective way possible.    \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  In view of the complementary nature of this project, the impact of the TA will continue to \nbe  strengthening  the  capacity  of  the  participating  countries  to  assume  greater  roles  and \nresponsibilities in planning, implementing, and coordinating the CAREC Program. Because of \nthe  importance  and  primary  role  of  NFPs  and  other  senior  officials  in  coordinating  and \nimplementing  regional  cooperation  initiatives  at  the  country  level,  and  taking  into  account \nspecific requirements of the PRC Fund (para. 8), the outcome of the TA will focus on enhancing \nthe capabilities and functions of NFPs. The outcome will be achieved by the following major \noutputs: (i) further development of the skills in policy planning and strategic management for \nregional cooperation of NFPs and other senior officials responsible for the CAREC Program, (ii) \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance for Capacity Building for Regional Cooperation in Central Asia. Manila (R9-04). \n10 Including (i) strengthening interest in and commitment to cooperation, (ii) strengthening national focal points \n(NFPs), (iii) mechanism for sharing regional cooperation experience and international best practices, and (iv) \nmechanisms for intersector coordination. (CAREC. 2005. Background Note on Capacity Building for Regional \nCooperation in Central Asia. Manila.) ", "  3\nexperience learned from other regional cooperation programs, (iii) process to be instituted to \ncoordinate regional initiatives at the country level, and (iv) research networks developed in \nsupport of the decision-making process and subsequent implementation of regional cooperation \ninitiatives.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The approach of the TA is to complement TA 6158, focusing on strengthening NFPs, \nwhich have a central place in coordinating and taking forward the CAREC Program at the \ncountry level. To ensure high impact, relevance, and coherence of the programs, the TA will \ninclude the following features: (i) the capacity-building events and topics will be determined \nbased on a survey of NFPs in the participating countries; (ii) as an integral part of the TA, an \nappropriate  measurement  mechanism  will  be  developed  by  a  training  specialist  to  assess \ncompetencies achieved and guide further improvement of the succeeding programs; (iii) the \nresource  speakers  will  be  selected  from  leading  scholars  in  the  relevant  areas,  with  the \nassistance of the regional cooperation specialists/coordinators based in ADB\u2019s field offices; (iv) \npresentations, background notes, and other reading materials for each capacity development \nevent  will  be  compiled  in  CD-ROM  for  future  reference  by  the  participants  and  wide \ndissemination to their colleagues and other stakeholders, as appropriate, in the participating \ncountries; and (v) resource speakers are expected to also contribute to establishing research \nand  knowledge  dissemination  networks  in  support  of  the  decision-making  process  and \nsubsequent implementation of regional cooperation. Key activities that will be funded by the TA \nwill include the following.  \n \n11.  High-Level Learning Program. Training and workshops will be organized on policy \nplanning and strategic management for regional cooperation. Training modules may comprise  \nprinciples,  methodologies,  and  process  of  programming  for  regional  cooperation;  national \nversus regional project identification; judging the relative benefits of and mobilizing resources for \nregional cooperation; strategic management and team building for regional cooperation; case \nstudies  of  regional  cooperation  in  South  Asia,  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS),  and/or \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), etc. Final selection of the topics will be based \non a survey or other forms of consultation with NFPs of the participating countries. The learning \nprogram will be high-impact events, targeting NFPs and other senior officials in charge of policy \nplanning and strategic management for the CAREC Program in the participating countries. \n \n12.  Cross-Learning and Networking. Cross-learning and networking programs will provide \nNFPs and concerned senior officials with an opportunity to discuss, network, and interact with \ntheir peers working on other regional cooperation programs. These events are expected to \nreinforce confidence in the benefits of and commitment to regional cooperation, provide insights \nand firsthand information on experiences and lessons learned from other regional initiatives, \ninspire new ideas and approaches, and establish useful contacts for continuing exchange of \ninformation and knowledge sharing in the future. \n \n13.  Instituting  a  Process  to  Coordinate  Regional  Initiatives  at  the  Country  Level. \nCoordinating regional initiatives at the country level is the core function of the NFP. The fact is \ncoordination among different administrations may turn out to be inefficient and ineffective. Thus, \na suitable coordinating process must be instituted to minimize sporadic courses of action. \nBrainstorming and experience sharing on the process will be undertaken at the training and \ncross-learning  events.  Research  and  proposals  for  more  systematic  solutions  will  also  be \ncommissioned by engaging appropriate consulting services. \n \n ", "4   \n14.  Developing Research and Knowledge Dissemination Networks in Support of the \nDecision-Making  Process  and  Subsequent  Implementation  of  Regional  Cooperation \nInitiatives. The capacity of NFPs to coordinate and make decisions on regional cooperation \nalso depends on whether they can have prompt access to pertinent analysis, advice, and \ninformation. To this end, the TA will help develop a research and knowledge dissemination \nnetwork in each participating country (including a record of first-rate outputs), with resource \nspeakers and leading scholars on regional cooperation in the DMC concerned as the backbone \nand key players.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $450,000 equivalent, of which $400,000 will be financed on \na grant basis by the PRC Poverty Reduction and Regional Cooperation Fund and administered \nby ADB. The participating governments will provide the remaining $50,000 equivalent, equal to \nthe imputed value of staff time and use of government facilities for activities under the TA. The \ndetailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The TA will be implemented over 18 months, from February 2006 to July 2007. ADB will \nbe the Executing Agency for the TA. ADB\u2019s CAREC Unit in the Operations Coordination Division \nwill  be  responsible  for  overall  implementation  of  TA  activities,  and  the  CAREC  regional \ncooperation coordinators in ADB\u2019s field offices will provide proactive assistance in determining \ndetails  of  the  training  topics/capacity-building  events,  selecting  domestic  consultants  and \nresource speakers, and making meeting and other necessary arrangements. There will be close \ncoordination  with  NFPs  of  the  CAREC  countries,  as  well  as  with  the  ongoing  capacity \ndevelopment activities financed by TA 6158.  \n \n17.  For implementation of the TA, domestic consultants will be engaged, for 4 person-\nmonths  on  intermittent  basis,  to  (i)  develop  a  measurement  mechanism  and  conduct \nperformance  assessment;  (ii)  develop  criteria,  process,  and  procedures  for  selecting \nparticipants in the capacity-building events and determining the topics; (iii) assist with instituting \na process to coordinate regional initiatives at the country level; and (iv) help develop research \nand knowledge dissemination networks. In addition, up to 24 resource speakers will be required, \nto lecture or lead discussions at the capacity-building events. ADB will engage the consultants \nand resource speakers in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. An outline of the terms of \nreference for consultants and resource speakers is in Appendix 3. One desktop computer (PC) \nis budgeted under the TA for the project secretariat. The PC will be procured in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and will be left with ADB at the completion of the TA. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 to be financed on a \ngrant basis by the People\u2019s Republic of China Poverty Reduction and Regional Cooperation \nFund for Capacity Building for Regional Cooperation in Central Asia, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board.
