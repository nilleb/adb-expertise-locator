INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The regional knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support micro, small, \nand medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) to recover from the economic effects of the coronavirus \ndisease (COVID-19) pandemic and become less vulnerable to a prolonged economic downturn \nin the Pacific developing member countries (DMCs) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).1 The \nTA will help build and enhance the capabilities of MSMEs affected by COVID-19 to recover and \ngrow in the post-pandemic period by (i) strengthening the enabling environment for MSMEs and \n(ii) improving access by MSMEs to business development services and finance.  \n \n2.  The  TA  forms  part  of  ADB's  comprehensive  response  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic, \nannounced on 13 April 2020, which includes a $20 billion package of loans, grants, and TA. It will \nsupport the recovery of MSMEs and contribute to ADB\u2019s broader efforts to address the pandemic's \nsocioeconomic impacts in its Pacific DMCs. The TA supports ADB's Strategy 2030, including its \noperational priorities 1 (to address the region's remaining poverty and reduce inequalities), 2 (to \naccelerate gender equality), and 6 (to strengthen governance and institutional capacity).2 The TA \nwill also contribute to achieving Sustainable Development Goals 8.3, 8.10, and 9.3.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Pacific economies impacted by the coronavirus disease. ADB estimates that losses \nfrom COVID-19 will total 6.4%\u20139.7% of global gross domestic product.4 The losses could be \nhigher in Pacific DMCs due to their remoteness, small size, wide geographic dispersal, narrow \neconomic base, and exposure to disasters triggered by natural hazards.5 The ability of most \nPacific DMCs to cope with multiple shocks is limited by weak capacity and a lack of resources. \nThe health of their economically vulnerable and poor populations is at risk, as health infrastructure \nis inadequate to respond to the pandemic. Recognizing this, Pacific DMCs moved decisively to \nrestrict international and domestic travel. These restrictions, combined with the introduction of \nphysical distancing measures, helped Pacific DMCs contain the pandemic but negatively affected \ntourism and trade.6 Given the decline in tourism and trade, ADB projects an average economic \ncontraction of 6.1% across all Pacific DMCs in 2020. The forecast contraction for 2020 worsens \nto 12.7% when Papua New Guinea, a DMC dependent on resource-based exports, is excluded.7 \nAlthough most Pacific economies are expected to start recovering in 2021, their economic \nperformance  is  not  likely  to  recover  to  pre-COVID-19  levels  in  the  short-term  because  of \nuncertainties related to the pandemic and its anticipated prolonged impact on businesses and \nemployment levels.8  \n \n4.  Micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises particularly impacted. MSMEs lack the \nfinancial capability to withstand the effects of a prolonged economic downturn. They are critical \n \n1  The technical assistance (TA) will support Pacific developing member countries (DMCs), including the Cook Islands, \nFiji, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, and Vanuatu. \n2  ADB. 2020.

Manila.  \n ", "2 \nto employment and livelihoods but lack the capacity to diversify or consolidate operations. In Asia \nand the Pacific, MSMEs generate 42% of economic activity, and their closures will have a long-\nterm impact on economic outputs and employment.9 About 89% of businesses in Pacific DMCs, \nmost of which are MSMEs, reported adverse effects from the pandemic, and 91% faced reduced \nrevenues.10 About 66% of the businesses have reduced their operational costs to counter a drop \nin income.11 The economic disruption caused by the pandemic has also affected access by \nMSMEs to supply chains and markets. By August 2020, 31% of businesses had closed (30% \ntemporarily and 1% permanently), and 36% reported a partial reduction in operations (footnote \n10). \n \n5.  Institutional mechanisms to support business recovery are lacking. With support \nfrom development partners, most Pacific DMCs have provided immediate financial support to \nMSMEs to respond to the pandemic.12 In August 2020, 45% of businesses reported having \naccessed such support, 23% reported needing help but not accessing it, and 20% reported that \nthey were unaware of any available support (footnote 10). Designated agencies\u2014such as MSME \nFiji, Samoa Business Hub, Business and Cooperative Division of Solomon Islands, Business \nSupport Division of Tonga, and Chambers of Commerce in the Cook Islands and Vanuatu\u2014have \nsupported  their  respective  governments  in  implementing  these  support  measures.  These \nagencies have acknowledged that they lack the capacity and tools to prepare for, and support, \nthe post-pandemic recovery of MSMEs. They require support to (i) consider options for recovery \nunder  different  scenarios;  (ii)  develop  recovery  frameworks  based  on  key  growth  sectors; \n(iii) strengthen their business support functions, including staff capacity to deliver business \ntraining; (iv) facilitate training and provide support to MSMEs operating in remote locations; and \n(v) improve coordination and awareness of available MSME support. \n \n6.  Weak enabling environment for micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises. Most \nPacific DMCs lack an enabling legal and regulatory environment to support the operations of \nMSMEs. Inefficiencies in the regulatory and administrative procedures, including complicated tax \nadministration, have resulted in high costs to start, operate, and close businesses. COVID-19 is \nchanging business dynamics, and agencies such as MSME Fiji have identified the need to review \nand adjust legislation to suit MSMEs' needs in the post-pandemic period. Many Pacific DMCs \nhave  supported  MSMEs,  including  those  in  the  informal  sector,  through  programs  under \nrespective ministerial plans  and specific sector  policies.  However, these  programs  are  not \nintegrated at the national level to support the formalization and development of MSMEs, and most \nMSMEs continues to operate as informal enterprises. The informality of MSMEs has limited their \naccess to broader entrepreneurial support, development programs, and financing. Inadequate \ndata on MSMEs has also been identified as a significant challenge in Pacific DMCs, including Fiji \nand the Solomon Islands, making targeted policy interventions difficult. Support to MSMEs need \nto extend beyond recovery and facilitate the formalization of their operations. This will require \nstructured government response that include reforms needed to create an enabling business \nenvironment. By doing this, national governments can spur the recovery, develop the private \nsector, and facilitate private sector-led economic recovery. \n \n9   ADB. 2018.

Impacts on Businesses in the Pacific. PTI Pacific Business Monitor Reports. Survey 5\u2014\nAugust 2020. \n11  By August 2020 about 49% of businesses, including MSMEs, have reduced work hours, 43% have reduced staff \nnumbers, and 33% have reduced their employees' wages. \n12  Governments and ADBs Broader Response to COVID-19 in Pacific DMCs with Components Targeting MSMEs \n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3).  \n ", "3 \n7.  Limited  business  capabilities  to  adapt.  MSMEs  in  the  Pacific  have  limited \npreparedness for a protracted economic downturn but remain optimistic about outlasting the \npandemic. Despite such optimism, the pandemic's impact on businesses is likely to be long-\nlasting\u201437% do not expect revenue to rise to pre-COVID-19 levels in 2021 (footnote 10). MSMEs \nhave identified the need for technical, advisory, and financial support to help them (i) manage the \neconomic downturn while exploring diversification opportunities (34%); (ii) review, update and \nstabilize their financial position (39%); and (iii) access new markets (33%). By August 2020, 38% \nof the businesses surveyed had diversified, and 22% introduced digital solutions to manage \ndisruptions and preserve business continuity (footnote 10). Most Pacific MSMEs rely on traditional \nbusiness models that use manual processes and conduct transactions in person. Adoption of \ntechnology and contactless solutions have been limited by MSMEs\u2019 (i) competing operational and \ntechnical  priorities,  (ii)  lack  of  appropriate  information  and  communication  technology \ninfrastructure, and (iii) weak technological capabilities.  \n \n8.  Poor access to finance accentuated by the coronavirus disease. Governments and \ncentral  banks  across  Pacific  DMCs  have  introduced  concessional  financing  facilities  to \nsupplement  MSMEs'  financing  needs  during  the  pandemic.13 These  facilities  are  available \nthrough  financial  institutions,  and  thus  MSMEs\u2014especially  those  operating  as  informal \nenterprises\u2014find them inaccessible. Most financial institutions, including commercial banks, \ncontinue to be reluctant to finance MSMEs because of limited capacity to underwrite and manage \nMSME loans, limited range of financial products available for MSMEs, and lack of acceptable \ncollateral,  particularly  land  which  is  mostly  under  communal  ownership  with  no  clear  and \ntransferrable titles. MSMEs\u2019 weak financial and business planning skills impede their ability to \nprepare  bankable  proposals. 14  COVID-19  has  stressed  the  income  levels  of  MSMEs, \naccentuating their inability to access finance. Access to finance will be critical for recovery; 88% \nof all businesses surveyed, including MSMEs, identified weak cash flow as a significant challenge, \nwith 45% reporting they need finance following the pandemic (footnote 10). Financial institutions \nthat are committed to serving MSMEs need to consider alternative approaches to address \nMSMEs\u2019 financing gap in the post-pandemic period; MSMEs need to strengthen their capabilities \nto access credit on an ongoing basis; and policies should be implemented to enable sustainable \nbusiness recovery, including developing properly functioning financial markets.  \n \n9.  The  pandemic  disproportionately  affected  women-owned  businesses.  MSMEs \nowned  by  women  operate  under  the  same  regulatory,  institutional,  and  pandemic-related \nconditions as those owned by men. Still, they must overcome additional gender-specific barriers \nto cope with disruptions caused by COVID-19. Close to 91% of businesses owned by women \nhave experienced declines in revenue; most operate in the informal sector, meaning their access \n \n13  In Fiji, the government has set up a COVID-19 concessional finance support package for MSMEs, while the Reserve \nBank of Fiji expanded its Natural Disaster and Rehabilitation Facility to include businesses affected by the \npandemic, including COVID-19. The Reserve Bank of Fiji has allocated $28.9 million to this facility, which is \naccessible through licensed financial institutions. In Vanuatu, the Council of Ministers approved the payment of a \none-off grant of $542 to all eligible small and medium-sized enterprises in response to COVID-19. In Tonga, the \ngovernment has announced an Economic and Social Stimulus Package of $26.3 million, while the National Reserve \nBank of Tonga Board approved the provision of liquidity support to the banking system to help vulnerable groups \nand entities, including MSMEs. In Papua New Guinea, the government allocated $91.2 million to be spent on \nagriculture, households, and business, including MSMEs. In Solomon Islands, the government through the \nDevelopment Bank of Solomon Islands announced a stimulus package of $39.8 million to support increased \neconomic activities in rural areas, employment and exports. An additional capital grant of $2.25 million has also \nbeen provided to support small and medium-sized enterprises. \n14  ADB. 2019. Technical Assistance for Pacific Private Sector Development Initiative, Phase IV. Manila. The TA will \ncomplement the reforms supported by the Pacific Private Sector Development Initiative on the enactment of \npersonal property securities acts in nine Pacific DMCs, which allows moveable assets to be used as collateral for \nsecuring credit.   \n ", "4 \nto pandemic relief support is limited.15 More importantly, their access to market information and \nbusiness support services critical for recovery is limited by existing gender norms. Restrictions on \nmovement because of COVID-19 has led to additional care burdens and reduced the time spent \nby women entrepreneurs on managing their businesses, with 41% of MSMEs owned by women \ntemporarily closed. MSMEs will face challenges in obtaining finance during the recovery period. \nStill, those led by women often face the additional disadvantage of having less control of assets \nand financial resources than do those MSMEs owned by men. \n \n10.  Lessons learned. Lessons from TA and projects that supported the private sector and \nMSMEs in the Pacific identified the need for interventions to (i) adopt a holistic approach to \nsupporting  the  development  of  MSMEs  that  includes  improving  the  business  environment, \n(ii) increase advisory services to serve client needs better, (iii) integrate support for women \nentrepreneurs, (iv) strengthen the capacity of financial institutions inclined to support MSMEs, \n(v) prioritize the use of national consultants, and (vi) strengthen coordination for improved \ncollaboration.16 Lessons, including recommendations from a thematic evaluation of ADB support \nfor small and medium-sized enterprises during 2005\u20132017, are incorporated in the TA (footnote \n9). \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: recovery of COVID-19\u2013affected MSMEs \nsustained and their vulnerability to prolonged economic downturn reduced. The TA will have the \nfollowing outcome: capability of MSMEs to recover from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic \nand grow in the post-pandemic period improved.17  \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n12.  Output 1: Enabling environment for recovery and development of micro, small, and \nmedium-sized enterprises strengthened. The TA will provide technical expertise to support \nMSME agencies in Pacific DMCs, including but not limited to the Cook Islands, Fiji, Samoa, \nSolomon Islands, and Vanuatu: (i) undertake scenario analysis and plan for recovery of MSMEs, \nincluding women-owned MSMEs; (ii) develop and strengthen strategies for the recovery of \nMSMEs that includes identifying priority sectors and establishing criteria to select MSMEs for \nsupport; (iii) improve institutional coordination of MSME support; and (iv) implement and monitor \ngovernment-supported COVID-19 programs for MSMEs, where necessary.18 The TA will also: \n(i) develop and strengthen appropriate legislation and policies, particularly for MSMEs to support \ntheir formalization and growth in the post-pandemic period;19 (ii) support diagnostic studies at the \nnational or regional level that includes assessing the readiness of MSMEs to adopt digital \n \n15  Pacific Trade Invest. 2020.

The \nPotential Scope of Work in Suggested Pacific Developing Member Countries is accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 3. Other DMCs may participate in the TA and discussions on potential areas of support will \ncontinue during implementation.  \n19  The TA will complement the efforts of the Private Sector Development Initiative, which provides policy advisory \nsupport to governments and institutions. Leveraging progress to-date, the TA will add value, provide more targeted \nsupport to MSMEs, and collaborate with ongoing programs to address broader constraints facing MSMEs. \n ", "5 \nbusiness solutions and exploring alternative options for improving MSMEs access to finance20; \n(iii) support a feasibility study for a national one-stop MSME information-sharing platform; and \n(iv) building on the feasibility study as appropriate, identify a pilot project for the development of \na national digital one-stop MSME information-sharing platform. The diagnostic studies will include \ngender analysis and sex-disaggregated data, where possible. The TA will leverage the local \nknowledge, existing structure, and network of MSME agencies and ensure that the COVID-19-\nrelated support to MSMEs under the TA is complementary, gender-responsive, and sustainable. \n \n13.  Output  2:  Micro,  small,  and  medium-sized  enterprises  access  to  business \ndevelopment services and finance improved. The TA will help MSMEs, including women-\nowned MSMEs, enhance their capabilities and recover from the effects of COVID-19 by accessing \nbusiness  development  services  and  finance.  The  TA  will support MSME  agencies  provide \neffective business development services to MSMEs in their respective DMCs by strengthening \ntheir business support functions, which includes (i) reviewing training materials; (ii) building \ncapacity of staff; and (iii) exploring appropriate online platforms for sustainable and cost-effective \ndelivery of training to MSMEs. The TA will help MSME agencies develop and strengthen the toolkit \nfor undertaking MSME viability and resilience checks and assess the impact of the pandemic on \ntheir revenue, profitability, and overall operations.21 The TA will organize a regional event for \nknowledge sharing on the recovery of MSMEs among all 14 Pacific DMCs.   \n \n14.  The TA will support MSMEs to adjust to the environment created by the pandemic by \nproviding  business  advisors.  The  business  advisors  will  help  MSMEs  (i)  analyze  market \ninformation, rethink opportunities, and diversify business lines; (ii) link to new markets; (iii) reorient \nthe business operations of MSMEs using technology;22 and (iv) develop crisis management \npolicies and business continuity plans to manage future disruptions.23 The TA will strengthen the \nfinancial capabilities of MSMEs by training MSME staff on better record keeping and financial and \ncash flow management practices; reviewing, updating, and stabilizing their financial position, \nincluding developing business plans and proposals for accessing finance; and linking businesses, \nwhen appropriate, with ongoing financial and technical support programs, including value chain \nfinance.24 The  TA  will  strengthen  MSMEs  financial  reporting  by  aligning  it  to  the  relevant \naccounting and auditing standards, acceptable to financial institutions. \n \n15.  The TA will strengthen financial institutions' capabilities to underwrite and manage MSME \nloans in Pacific DMCs, including but not limited to Samoa, the Solomon Islands, and Tonga by \n(i) developing gender-responsive policies and products for MSMEs; (ii) assessing their adoption \nof financial technology solutions for contactless delivery of financial services to MSMEs, including \n \n20  The diagnostic study on alternative sources of finance for MSMEs will include an assessment on the existing credit \nguarantee schemes, functions of the credit unions and cooperatives, and the role of financial markets in Pacific\u2019s \nfinancial system. \n21  The toolkit will help identify MSMEs affected by COVID-19. It will assess the viability and resilience of MSMEs by \nanalyzing their pre-COVID-19 performance, evaluating the impact of the pandemic on individual MSMEs, and \nreviewing their adaptation plans. Based on the assessment, MSMEs will receive relevant business development \nand advisory support directly funded by the TA in para. 14.  \n22  Technology-related support to MSMEs under the TA includes: (i) re-evaluating the business model of the MSMEs; \n(ii) providing technical advice and guidance on their digital readiness, including identifying gaps in policies, \nprocesses, and systems; (iii) developing roadmaps for their adoption of technology, including using digital payments \nand online commerce; and (iv) facilitating training to improve their overall technical knowledge and capabilities. \n23  The TA will provide relevant business development and mentoring support to reposition MSMEs in the post-\npandemic period, including linking them to broader business advisory and development programs. \n24  The TA will explore the expansion of successful value chain financing pilots led by Pacific Private Sector \nDevelopment Initiative. The TA will collaborate with ongoing programs, including the Pacific Private Sector \nDevelopment Initiative, the Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative, Business Link Pacific (footnote 28), and the \nproposed Pacific MSME Finance Facility. \n ", "6 \nidentifying relevant pilot projects; and (iii) building institutional capacity.25 The TA will also explore \nalternative sources of finance for MSMEs and coordinate efforts with the Pacific Private Sector \nDevelopment Initiative, Phase IV on capital raising initiatives such as peer-to-peer lending and \ncrowdfunding, and invoice and inventory financing. \n \n16.  The TA will take a targeted, demand-driven, and differentiated approach, whereby support \nwill be provided to sectors and MSMEs that are most affected by the pandemic and are critical to \nbroader economic recovery. The national definition for MSMEs will guide the TA where possible. \nMSMEs, including women entrepreneurs selected for support under Output 2, will be identified \nthrough entry points or referrals from MSME agencies in Pacific DMCs, including, but not limited \nto the Cook Islands (Chamber of Commerce), Fiji (MSME Fiji), Samoa (Samoa Business Hub), \nSolomon Islands (Business and Cooperative Division), Tonga (Business Support Division), and \nVanuatu (Chamber of Commerce). Selected MSMEs will be assigned business advisors with the \nnecessary expertise. Business advisors will be engaged in close coordination with the existing \nBusiness Link Pacific program.26 The TA will prioritize the use of Business Link Pacific\u2019s pool of \nlocal advisors to deliver Output 2. An impact evaluation will be undertaken as and when needed \nto assess the impact of targeted support provided to MSME agencies, MSMEs, and financial \ninstitutions. The project team will collaborate with regional and Pacific country offices, and ADB's \nongoing COVID-19 pandemic-related operations that targets support to MSMEs to increase \nawareness of this TA. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $3,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB's \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF)\u2014$808,000 from TASF 6 and $2,192,000 from TASF\u2013\nother sources. The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  ADB will administer the TA through its Pacific Liaison and Coordination Office in Sydney. \nIt will implement the TA over 48 months from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2024. The \nresponsible TA officer will oversee the day-to-day operations of the TA. Consultants that are \nrecruited  will  comply  with  applicable  ADB  policies  and  guidelines.  The  TA  will  use  ADB's \nKnowledge Nexus to ensure broader coordination with other ADB departments and store all \nknowledge produced.
