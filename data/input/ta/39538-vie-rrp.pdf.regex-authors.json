The \nSRCGFP will not have any involuntary resettlement impact, as it \nhas no component for creating new physical assets. None of the \ndebt  and  operational  restructuring  measures  in  general \ncorporations  associated  with  the  facility  will  trigger  activities \nrelated to indigenous people. \n   \nInvestment Program   The SRCGFP will support the agenda of the Government of Viet \nDescription  Nam (the Government) for state-owned enterprise (SOE) reform \nby equitizing and transforming general corporations. Participating \ngeneral corporations will be restructured under a comprehensive \npackage of corporate and financial restructuring and enhanced \noperational  efficiency  and  corporate  governance.  Debt \nrestructuring will strengthen general corporation balance sheets \nthrough  improved  cash  flows  and  debt-servicing  capacity, \ngenerating additional resources for productive activities. None of \nthe  restructured  debt  will  be  nonperforming  loans.  Corporate \nrestructuring  will  enable  participating  general  corporations  to \nexploit economies of both scale and scope by merging several \nsmall  joint stock  subsidiaries  in  each  general  corporation  into \nlarger entities organized along lines of business, combined with \nthe divestiture of disparate non-core business units. Additionally, \nmanagement restructuring will enhance operational efficiency by \nstrengthening corporate management processes and improving \ngovernance. Ordinary capital resources (OCR) will be used to \nsupport financial and corporate restructuring, while operational \nrestructuring  and  improved  corporate  governance  will  be \nsupported by the complementary loan component funded from \nAsian Development Fund (ADF) resources. The facility will also \nprovide support for institutions playing key roles in SOE reform, \nsuch  as  the  Debt  Asset  Trading  Corporation  (DATC),  which \naddresses SOE debt resolution. \n \nMultitranche Financing  The Government has requested ADB to support the reform and \nFacility   transformation of general corporations and the strengthening of ", "ii   \nother  institutions  related  to  reforming  SOEs.  Despite  political \ncommitment at the highest level, implementation challenges have \nconstrained SOE reform. The complexity and difficulty of SOE \nreform in Viet Nam engender a concomitant need for flexibility \nand  commitment.  This  context  informs  the  rationale  for  the \nmultitranche  financing  facility  (MFF)  as  the  most  appropriate \nlending modality for the SRCGFP. A program loan cluster would \nbe a less appropriate modality because of its emphasis on policy \nconditions, while what are needed are resources for the SOEs to \nuse to restructure. A sector development loan would also be less \nappropriate  because  of  the  diversity  of  sector  coverage \nenvisioned under the SRCGFP. \n \nThe  SRCGFP  fulfills  the  requirements  for  using  the  MFF \nmodality. The Government has a road map for the transformation \nof the SOE sector consisting of the conversion of SOEs through \nequitization, seeking to combine or follow equitization with listing \nto  attract  new  capital  for  them,  increase  their  efficiency,  and \nnarrow the role of state in their management. The road map is \nsupported by policy and legal frameworks. As part of its road \nmap, the Government initially focused on equitizing smaller SOEs \nto test and refine the process. Subsequently, the Government \naggregated many SOEs into general corporations and sought to \ndefine and develop a parent\u2013subsidiary company model for them. \nThe equitization and transformation of general corporations is the \nnext  challenge  for  the  Government,  which  recognizes  that \nsuccessfully transforming large SOEs and general corporations \nwill  take  time  and  resources.  The  Government's  vision  is  to \nreorganize,  renew,  and  restructure  SOEs  to  improve  their \nefficiency,  adaptability  to  market  mechanisms,  and \ncompetitiveness in the context of global economic integration. \nThe  Government's  policy  framework  additionally  endorses  the \nprinciple of eliminating the role of line ministries in managing \nSOEs;  separating  the  ownership  and  management  of  general \ncorporations; and enhancing their transparency, accountability, \nprofessionalism,  and  operational  efficiency.  Nonetheless,  the \npolicy framework will need to be strengthened as SOE reform \ngradually moves into the post-equitization phase. In particular, \nthe Government will need to review the framework for ownership \nof the state's interest in economic organizations to facilitate the \nnecessary separation of ownership from management of large \nSOEs and general corporations.  \n \nRationale   Transforming and reforming SOEs are critical to reducing the \ndominance  of  inefficient  state  production,  promoting  private \nsector  development,  and  enhancing  economic  growth.  The \nGovernment's  Socio-Economic  Development  Plan  2006\u20132010 \ncalls  for  diversifying  ownership  to  improve  the  efficiency  and \ncompetitiveness of SOEs and for narrowing or eliminating the role \nof  ministries  and  other  state  entities  in  SOE  governance  and \nmanagement.  ", "  iii\n \nADB's strategy towards the SOE sector in Viet Nam has two \ndefining characteristics: long-term support and responsiveness. \nADB  has  been  engaged  with  SOE  reform  since  early  on, \napproving  the  State-Owned  Enterprise  Reform  and  Corporate \nGovernance  Program  in  1999.  ADB's  country  strategy  and \nprogram  2007\u20132011  underlined  SOE  reform  as  central  to  its \nstrategy  for  business  development  and  private  sector-led \nemployment growth.  \n \nADB's approach to the SOE sector has been responsive to the \nevolving contours of the long reform process, which has been \nboth  complex  and  sensitive  in  Viet  Nam,  often  requiring \nconsensus at the highest levels of decision making. ADB's first \nloan addressed prevailing constraints, including the creation of a \ncentralized government institution to formulate, coordinate, and \nlead the implementation of SOE reform, adoption of a modern law \non enterprises, and divestiture of small enterprises and gradual \nreduction in shareholding of large and medium-sized SOEs. A \ndecade later, the context of SOE reform has altered, and new \nneeds  have  emerged.  While  thousands  of  SOEs  have  been \nequitized, they account for only a modest fraction of the state\u2019s \ntotal investments. Qualitative results have been disappointing, as \nmany of the equitized entities remained inefficient and dependent \non state support for generating business. The equitization that \nremains  to  be  done  is  the  more  difficult  part,  concentrated \nprimarily in general corporations. SOE reform is stymied for lack \nof viable approaches toward equitizing and transforming large \ngeneral  corporations.  Through  the  SRCGFP,  ADB  is  again \nintroducing  a  timely  catalyst  into  the  SOE  reform  process  by \nproposing a comprehensive approach to successfully equitizing \ngeneral  corporations  and  transforming  them  into  globally \ncompetitive entities. \n  \nEquitization  is  only  one  step  in  a  successful  transformation \nprocess  for  SOEs  and  needs  to  be  complemented,  even \npreceded,  by  a  host  of  other  steps,  including  strategic  and \nbusiness  planning,  corporate  and  financial  restructuring, \nattracting  investment  and  corporate  financing,  forming  value-\nadding  business  partnerships  or  alliances,  and  implementing \nmore transparent governance. Enhancing the market education \nof management and staff, modernizing management information \nsystems  and  human  resource  development  systems,  and \npossibly listing on the stock exchange are additional steps and \nchallenges  that  need  to  be  addressed  for  effective  and \ncomprehensive transformation.  \n \nThe complexity of successfully transforming a large SOE makes it \nimportant to keep the first stage manageable by focusing on a \nselect few. After consulting with several general corporations, the \nGovernment proposed an initial list of four general corporations \n ", "iv   \nfor potential participation in the SRCGFP, from which two have \nbeen selected for the first stage. The selection was based on the \nviability  of  debt  restructuring  and  readiness,  reflected  in \nexpressed  commitment  to  undertaking  appropriate  corporate, \nfinancial,  and  operational  restructuring  and  in  approval  of  the \nproposed restructuring from the general corporation's board of \nmanagement and the line ministries concerned.  \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The  proposed  SRCGFP  will  make  equitized  and  restructured \nSOEs, including large general corporations and their subsidiaries, \nmore profitable and transparent. The expected outcome will be \nthe  transformation  of  several  general  corporations  and  their \nsubsidiaries  into  focused,  efficient  businesses  with  stronger \nbalance  sheets  and  improved  corporate  governance.  By \ndeveloping  a  successful  and  sustainable  model  for  general \ncorporation transformation, the SRCGFP will provide a renewed \ndirection and focus for further SOE reform. \n   \nInvestment Program   The total investment program cost for 2009\u20132015 is estimated at \n$1.77 billion equivalent. The total cost of projects in tranche 1 is \nestimated at $130 million equivalent. \n \nInvestment Program  \n($ million) \n  Investment Program Component  Sector Investment Plan \nA.

ADB will use its OCR to support \nfinancial  and  corporate  restructuring  in  participating  general \ncorporations. All provisions of ordinary loan regulations applicable \nto ADB's London interbank offered rate-based loans will apply to \neach loan, subject to modifications, if any, that may be agreed in \nthe framework financing agreement, supplemented by any loan \nand  project  agreements.  The  Government  will  onlend  the  full \namount of ADB's OCR loan to participating general corporations \nin the same currency as in the primary loan agreement between \nADB and the Government and with ADB's lending terms to the \nGovernment, plus other costs determined by the Government and \nacceptable to ADB. \n   ", "  v\n  The Government has also requested ADB to provide $30 million \nequivalent  from  its  ADF  resources  to  support  the  operational \nrestructuring  of  the  participating  general  corporations  and  for \nstrengthening institutions critical to SOE reform, such as DATC. \nThe ADF loan under the first tranche will have an interest rate of \n1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter; a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; \nand  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in \naccordance  with  those  agreed  in  the  framework  financing \nagreement, supplemented by loan agreements. The Government \nwill onlend the full amount of the ADF loan to the participating \nentities in the borrowing currency or in dong, again with the terms \nof  the  lending  the  same  as  those  between  ADB  and  the \nGovernment, plus other costs determined by the Government and \nacceptable to ADB.  \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  The utilization period for the facility will be from December 2009 \nto 31 December 2015. No periodic financing requests (PFRs) will \nbe accepted after this date, though disbursements of approved \nPFRs will be allowed until the completion of the projects included \nin the last PFR. The implementation period of each tranche or \nloan is expected not to exceed 3 years. \n   \nImplementation  The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be the Executing Agency for \nArrangements  the facility and responsible for the supervision and execution of \nthe SRCGFP. Immediately following the approval of the facility, \nMOF will establish a program management unit and a facility \nsteering  committee  to  monitor  SRCGFP  implementation.  The \nfacility  steering  committee  will  consist  of  representatives  of \nrelevant  government  agencies  and  be  headed  by  the  vice \nminister  in  MOF.  For  the  first  tranche,  Song  Da  General \nCorporation  (Song  Da),  Southern  Waterborne  Transport \nCorporation (Sowatco), and DATC will be implementing agencies \n(IAs).  IAs  in  subsequent  tranches  will  be  participating  SOEs, \ngeneral  corporations,  and/or  Government  agencies  promoting \nSOE  sector  reforms.  The  first-tranche  project  involves \ncomprehensive restructuring of two general corporations, Song \nDa and Sowatco. The project will also enhance the operational \nefficiency  of  DATC  in  facilitating  and  supporting  SOE  reform. \nOperational restructuring at the three IAs will be facilitated by \nconsultant  services  and  supervised  by  respective  boards  of \nmanagement. \n \nProcurement, Consulting  The  ADF  loan  will  be  used  exclusively  for  meeting  expenses \nServices and  incurred in operational restructuring, enhancing governance, and \nDisbursement  building  capacity  in  participating  general  corporations  and \ninstitutions.  These  expenses  will  primarily  be  for  consulting \nservices to implement restructuring and equipment for information \nmanagement. In the first stage, the ADF proceeds will be used \nsolely  for  meeting  the  expenses  to  be  incurred,  or  already \nincurred within the provisions of retroactive financing of ADB, by \n ", "vi   \nthe three IAs: Song Da and Sowatco for undertaking their agreed \nmanagement  restructuring  and  corporate  governance \nstrengthening, and DATC for enhancing its operational efficiency, \nas agreed with ADB. Except as ADB may otherwise agree, the \nthree IAs shall each establish immediately after the effective date \nan  imprest  account  for  ADF  funds  at  a  commercial  bank \nacceptable to ADB, to be used solely for the purposes stated \nabove. \n   \nRetroactive Financing  Except  as  otherwise  agreed  with  ADB,  eligible  expenditures \nincurred before each loan takes effect but not earlier than 12 \nmonths before the loan agreement is signed, and incurred directly \nfor  operational  and  corporate  restructuring,  will  qualify  for \nretroactive financing, up to 20% of the proposed amount of the \nloans under the facility.  \n   \nProgram Benefits and  The  static  and  dynamic  efficiency  losses  from  direct  state \nBeneficiaries  involvement in the production of economic goods and services \nare  well  known  and  documented.  Transforming  general \ncorporations will help capture efficiency gains and pave the way \nfor the greater rationalization of government policies at the sector \nlevel. To protect its assets in the general corporations, the state \nhas  tended  to  adopt  protectionist  policies  that  promote \nmonopolistic  power,  hinder  competitiveness,  and  curb  private \nsector development. Greater competitiveness in the transformed \ngeneral  corporations  will  facilitate  the  state\u2019s  adoption  of  less \nrestrictive sector and pricing policies, further enhancing efficiency \ngains for the economy. General corporation transformation will \nbenefit many SOE workers, who were the dominant buyers of \nnow-illiquid shares in the small SOEs equitized earlier on. The \nproposed corporate restructuring will enable many of the SOE \nshareholders to trade their illiquid shares of equitized small SOEs \nfor the shares of large, efficient sub-holding companies that may \neven be listed on the stock exchange. The development of capital \nmarkets will benefit from the creation of iconic companies that \nmay shortly evolve into blue chip stocks. Finally, strengthening \nrestructured  general  corporations'  balance  sheets  with  more \nefficient and profitable operations will ameliorate the problem of \nnonperforming  loans  to  SOEs  from  state-owned  commercial \nbanks, thus benefiting the banking system. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions   The  SRCGFP  assumes  continued  Government  commitment \ntowards  an  increasingly  market-oriented  economy,  and  short-\nterm impact of the current global crisis. Potential risks to the \nSRCGFP are identified below. \n \n(i)  Resistance  from  vested  interests  to  SOE  reforms. \nReforms  and  initiatives  may  be  delayed  by  resistance \nfrom vested interests opposed to SOE reform. However, \nthis  risk  is  considered  modest,  as  the  Government's \napproach  so  far  has  been  sustained,  if  cautious, ", "  vii\ncommitment to pursuing SOE reform. The Government \nhas  indicated  it  will  renew  its  plan  for  equitizing  large \nSOEs  and  general  corporations  and  is  looking  to  the \nSRCGFP to demonstrate a viable and successful model \nand to enhance reform momentum. The Government is \naware that SOE reform is critical to successfully meeting \nobligations arising from agreements entered into during \nthe country's accession to the World Trade Organization.  \n \n(ii)  Use  of  general  corporations  for  noneconomic \nobjectives.  The  equitized  and  transformed  general \ncorporations may be hindered in operating profitably if the \nGovernment  uses  them  for  noneconomic  objectives \nthrough, for example, price controls set at the sector level \nor  requiring  general  corporations  to  undertake \nnoncommercial activities. However, the sustained use of \nsuch  measures  would  be  against  the  Government's \ninterest  in  transforming  the  inefficient  SOE  sector.  In \naddition,  the  proposed  operational  restructuring  would \nconfine noncommercial activities, if any, to the general \ncorporation  level,  which  would  make  them  more \ntransparent and distinct from the commercial operations \nof the sub-holding companies. ADB is also engaged in \npolicy dialog on SOE reform with the Government through \nthe poverty reduction and support credit process. \n \n(iii)  Capacity limitations in general corporations may limit \nabsorption and dilute implementation, particularly for \nimproving  corporate  governance.  The  capacity  of \nrestructuring institutions to assimilate and absorb change \nmay be low, especially below senior management. This \nmay  constrain  the  quality  of  operational  restructuring. \nWeak implementation may compromise improved internal \ngovernance,  particularly  of  independent  directors.  To \naddress this, proposed restructuring measures include the \ndevelopment  of  comprehensive  training  programs  and \ndetailed  training  on  corporate  governance  and  key \ncomponents  relevant  to  enterprise  operations.  Detailed \nmeasures for improved governance have been approved \nby the boards of management of the general corporations, \nincluding  criteria  for  independent  directors  and  the \npromulgation of a code of ethics for the directors and \nother  stakeholders.  Independent  consultants  will  be \nrecruited under ADF funding to facilitate, supervise, and \nmonitor the implementation of the agreed measures. \n \n(iv)    Corporate  restructuring  requiring  share  swaps  and \nbuybacks may take too long. Realigning all subsidiaries \nalong  focused  lines  of  business  in  the  sub-holding \ncompany model may be slow, particularly if consensus is \nlacking on the relative pricing of shares of the subsidiaries \nand  the  parent  company.  However,  shares  of  many \n ", "viii   \nsubsidiaries are quite illiquid, and the incentive to swap \nthem for shares in larger companies with better potential \nfor access to capital markets and economies of scale and \nscope  would  be  strong.  This  incentive  will  be  further \nstrengthened as the results of financial and operational \nrestructuring become more evident in general corporation \nbalance sheets and performance. ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the SOE Reform \nand Corporate Governance Facilitation Program. The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  Long  period  of  reforms. Equitizing state-owned enterprises (SOEs)\u2014or converting \nSOEs into joint stock companies with limited liability\u2014was launched in Viet Nam in mid-1992, \nbut by the end of 1997 only 17 enterprises had been equitized. In 1998, following a review of the \nSOE reform program, several new initiatives were undertaken, including (i) Prime Minister \nCircular No. 20/1998/CT-TTg, which set out the main policies to guide the restructuring of \nenterprises,  including  the  framework  for  classifying  SOEs  in  terms  of  plans  for  ownership \ndiversification; (ii) Decree No. 44/1998/ND/CP, which clarified and simplified the equitization \nprocess; (iii) the setting up of a national enterprise reform committee to approach SOE reform; \nand (iv) the announcement of equitization targets up to 2000, including the complete divestiture \nof small enterprises with capital of less than D1 billion.  \n \n3.  In subsequent years, the Government has repeatedly refined and revised regulations on \nSOE conversion (Appendix 2). The current legal framework of SOE reform1 comprises (i) the \nLaw on State-Owned Enterprises, Enterprise Law, and Law on Securities; (ii) decrees, circulars, \nand instructions on the equitization process; (iii) decrees, circulars, and instructions on other \ntypes  of  SOE  conversion  (sales,  assignments,  and  management  contracts);  (iv)  decrees, \ncirculars,  and  instructions  on  the  conversion  process  applicable  to  the  parent  company\u2013\nsubsidiary model; and (v) decrees, circulars, and instructions on the financial management and \nmonitoring of SOEs. Nationally, SOE reform is monitored by the National Steering Committee \nfor Enterprise Reform and Development (NSCERD), which is chaired by the Prime Minister in \ncoordination with the Ministry of Finance (MOF). \n \n4.  Regulatory refinements reduced the time required for equitization, which initially took 3 \nyears, to 13 months by 2006. Following the issuance of Decree 109 in 2007, it now takes 9 \nmonths. The number of SOE conversions each year increased during this decade, with 282 \nSOEs equitized in 2001, 378 in 2002, 616 in 2003, and more than 800 in each of following 2 \nyears. According to the latest data from MOF, as of 31 December 2007, 4,979 SOEs had been \nconverted, of which 3,369 had been equitized.2 For 2008\u20132010, the Government has plans to \nconvert the remaining 1,535 SOEs, of which 948 are proposed for equitization (Table 1).  \n \n5.  SOEs can be grouped into two categories: state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs) and \nothers. The Government has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to support only the \nnon-SOCB  SOEs  under  the  State-Owned  Enterprise  Reform  and  Corporate  Governance \nFacilitation Program (SRCGFP).3 \n                                                 \n1  More details on relevant regulations are in Supplementary Appendix A. \n2  The Government has converted SOEs through equitization as well as by conversion into single-member limited-\nliability  companies,  sale,  merger,  liquidation  and  bankruptcy,  and  management  and  lease  contracts,  but \nequitization has been the dominant method, accounting for almost two thirds of all SOE conversions. \n3  For the remainder of the document, SOCBs are thus excluded from the discussion of SOEs. The SOCBs are \nseparated from the state budget, but some fiscal operations are undertaken through the policy banks \u2014Vietnam \nDevelopment Bank and Vietnam Bank for social policies. The International Monetary Fund includes net lending by \nVietnam Development Bank in the overall fiscal balance.

Slow pace. Progress in equitizing SOEs has been below expectations. Detailed data on \nthe progress of SOE equitization are not easily available; until 2006, according to a donor-\nassisted database at NSCERD, fewer than 60% of the targeted SOEs had been converted. As \nis evident in Table 1, as of end-2007, only 76% of the target had been achieved, despite efforts \nhaving begun nearly 15 years earlier.  \n \n7.  Small SOEs equitized. Most of the SOEs equitized to 2006 were small, with 46% \nhaving capital of less than D5 billion, though the size increased marginally over time. The \naverage number of employees in the equitized SOEs was 260, which was equivalent to 36% of \nall employees of SOEs prior to the  start of equitization. The SOEs equitized by mid-2006 \naccounted for only a third of SOE bank debt at the time.  \n \n8.  Few  outside  investors.  Early  equitization  was  primarily  internal,  with  employees \nacquiring more than half the shares in the equitized SOE. The government and employees \ntogether held almost 80% of the shares. Very few outsiders such as strategic investors were \ninvolved. Over time, the stake of employees declined modestly while that of company outsiders \nincreased, reflecting in part the introduction of Decree 187 in 2004, which required equitized \nSOEs to auction shares to the public rather than sell them at company premises.  \n \n9.  State control retained. The state has often retained a dominant share of more than \n50% in equitized SOEs. The larger the SOE, the more the state share of capital has exceeded \n50%.4 Higher state shares in the larger SOEs equitized later can be attributed in many instances \nto  excessively  high  valuation  and  low  profitability,  resulting  in  little  interest  from  external \ninvestors and undersubscribed auctions.  \n \n10.  General corporations. In the mid-1990s, the Government organized most SOEs into 17 \ngeneral corporations, or conglomerates, reporting to the Prime Minister (GC91s) and 77 special \ngeneral corporations under line ministries and provincial people's committees (GC90s). In 2002, \nthese 94 general corporations included 1,605 member SOEs and represented 28% of all SOEs \nand 65% of the capital of all SOEs. The general corporations often do not control the equity in \nall the myriad companies under their umbrella and, hence, exert uneven control over them. The \nGovernment has thus been converting general corporations into holding companies or, in a few \ncases, economic groups.5  \n \n                                                 \n4  Equitized SOEs with state shareholding of more than 50% are still considered as SOEs because the state retains \ncontrolling power in them. \n5  An economic group is not yet legally defined, but the term describes enterprises, each with distinct legal status, \nthat are bound together through mutual investments, capital contributions, or other forms of affiliation and are \norganized under the holding company model. All subsidiaries of economic groups are equitized or otherwise \nrestructured. General corporations are corporate entities consisting of a wholly state-owned parent or holding \ncompany and a group of subsidiary companies, which may be wholly state-owned or in which the state holds a \ncontrolling interest. \n ", "                   3\n11.  The  real  work  has  yet  to  begin.  The  challenge  ahead  is  the  equitization  and \ntransformation of the GC90s and GC91s into efficient and profitable entities, fully unleashing the \npotential value of their assets, including their constituent companies. In December 2006, the \nPrime Minister approved Decision 1729/QD-TTg, a master plan that includes a list of general \ncorporations identified for equitization. The plan was for about 20 general corporations to be \nequitized every year from 2007 to 2010. As of 31 May 2008, none of the GC91s and only seven \nGC90s had been equitized.6  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Flawed Initial Focus \n12.  Focus on small state-owned enterprises. An important factor underlying the slow \npace of SOE reform was the Government's initial encouragement for equitizing small, loss-\nmaking SOEs rather than large, profitable ones. The Government's approach to the larger \nSOEs was to make them more competitive instead. The emphasis on first equitizing smaller \nbusiness units and subsidiaries meant the resulting equitized SOEs were typically too small to \nbe listed. Further, they continued to rely on the larger general corporation for funding, business \nrevenue,  and  technical  and  other  management  assistance.  In  many  instances,  the  small \nequitized subsidiaries of general corporations undertook similar business activities, causing \nduplication of resources, internal competition, and conflict of interest in general corporations. \n \n13.  Focus on quantity rather than quality. Little or no emphasis was placed on qualitative \nfactors in designing the equitization plan, to ensure that the business operations of an equitized \nSOE would be sustainable and that it would be able to operate independently. Under Clause 5 \n(a) Article 54 of Decree 109/2007-ND-CP, the responsibilities of the SOE reform committee, \nwhich is formed in the SOE to oversee its equitization, include directing the formulation of the \nequitization  plan  and  verifying  the  value  of  the  enterprise.  However,  there  is  no  specific \nguideline on the need to take into account qualitative considerations, including the sustainability \nof  operations  and  profitability,  in  the  equitization  plan.  There  is  also  no  requirement  for \nindependence of the appointed advisors and valuers or for subjecting the equitization plan to \ndue diligence review. Existing practice allows the management of the SOE to play a major role \nin formulating the equitization plan, which has raised conflicts of interest \n \n14.  Focus on corporatization without listing. Equitization and listing have been viewed as \ntwo separate exercises, and listing has not been considered a critical criterion during planning \nfor equitization. Coupled with the lack of consideration for other qualitative factors, this has \nresulted in many equitized entities being too small to be listed. As most of these equitizations \nwere internal, with employees and government taking almost 80% of the equitized shares, many \nSOE employees-cum-investors are stuck with illiquid assets. The situation is exacerbated by the \nrecent decline in asset markets and the fact that workers often borrowed to purchase shares.  \n \n2.  Constraints at the General Corporation Level \n15.  Difficulties in valuation. The valuation of general corporations is complicated by the \nneed to value their shareholdings in subsidiaries that may be engaged in a wide spectrum of \nbusinesses, some of which may have been equitized and listed. The boards of management of \nequitized subsidiaries are generally quite autonomous and distinct from that of the general \ncorporation, and the equitized subsidiaries are typically allowed to make business decisions \n                                                 \n6  In August 2009, the Government issued instructions that all remaining general corporations should come under the \nEnterprise Law by converting into single-member limited-liability companies by 2010, with restructuring to follow \nlater, including conversion into joint stock companies as appropriate. \n ", " 4 \nthemselves. Hence, it is difficult for others, such as strategic investors, to properly evaluate the \nextent of influence the general corporation has on the management of subsidiaries. \n \n16.  General corporations and large SOEs often face difficulty in documenting such details as \ndesign capacity, years of use, year of manufacture, etc., of machinery and equipment, much of \nwhich is obsolete and out of production. Valuating general corporations\u2019 landholdings has also \nproved difficult. This creates difficulty in obtaining price quotations for enterprise assets as \nrequired by regulations.  \n \n17.  Cumbersome size. Due to the large scale and complexity of operations, management \nin many general corporations has limitations in terms of skills and capacity to undertake the \nneeded  strategic  and  operational  restructuring.  In  addition,  the  total  value  of  some  of  the \ngeneral corporations together with their subsidiaries may be too great for others, including staff \nand management and even many outside strategic investors, to acquire a meaningful holding \nduring equitization. Figure 1 illustrates the structure of Song Da General Corporation (Song Da), \na general corporation that has confirmed participation in the proposed facility. \n \n18.  Financial  constraints. A major constraint on transforming general corporations has \nbeen the financial weakness of many of them. General corporations have relied on extensive \nborrowing from the Government and SOCBs to finance their operations, having virtually no \naccess to capital markets. Most of the large SOEs and general corporations have very high \ndebt, with  debt-to-equity ratios frequently far in excess of 100%. This has severely constrained \ntheir ability to service their debts and contributed to the high number of nonperforming loans in \nthe banking system. High indebtedness also implies that general corporations are ill-equipped to \ndeal with risks and will not have the financial capacity to fund capital investments. The problem \nis exacerbated by much of the general corporation debt being high cost and short term. \n \n3.  Institutional and Capacity Constraints \n19.  Need to enhance debt resolution. The lack of effective resolution of nonperforming \ndebts has brought stalemate and prolonged the remaining SOE divestitures. The Government \nestablished the Debt and Asset Trading Corporation (DATC) in 2003 to acquire and resolve \nnonperforming loans and uncollectible receivables owned by SOEs and to deal in and resolve \ninterests received from SOEs upon equitization. To date, the recovery ratios of received debts \nare relatively low, equal to only 10% of total book value.7 Going forward, it will be necessary to \nconsider the legal mechanisms, processes, powers, and financial resources of DATC. \n \n20.  DATC  needs  to  improve  its  internal  management,  including  developing  its  human \nresources  and  enhancing  its  information  system.  The  current  organization  lacks  important \ndepartments such as for internal audit, investment, public relations, and corporate restructuring. \nDATC needs to review its financial capacity relative to the size of nonperforming loans in the \ncountry and to outsource or otherwise obtain the industry-specific expertise necessary to devise \nworkouts. \n \n21.  Enhancing management of state capital. In 2005, the Government established the \nState Capital Investment Corporation (SCIC) to manage state investments in enterprises and to \ninvest and trade in state capital. The primary objectives of SCIC are to accelerate and enhance \nthe effectiveness of SOE reform and to make the utilization of state capital more efficient. SCIC \ncommenced  operations  in  August  2006  and,  by  December  2007,  managed  an  investment \n                                                 \n7  Among 19,526 items of nonperforming assets, 14,764 items with total book value of D659 billion are considered to \nbe irrecoverable (DATC. 2007. Operational Report. Ha Noi). \n ", "                   5\nportfolio of 829 enterprises with a total book value of D7,710 billion. Three quarters of these \nenterprises are very small, with legal capital of less than D10 billion, and operate ineffectively. \nSCIC plans to divest state capital in more than 700 of these equitized SOEs. An optimal solution \nwould be to enhance the value of the SOEs by restructuring them before divestment. However, \nsuch restructuring is difficult to implement, as SCIC is only one of the shareholders in the SOEs.  \n \n \nFigure 1: General Corporation: Song Da  \nConstruction of Hydropower Dam  Ministry of Construction\nProduction of  Industrial Products\nParent Company ($)\nOther \nProduction and Trading of Electricity Transportation \nOther construction (Road/Building/Bridge/etc.) \n% of \n% of ownership \nDependant Accounting Members Subsidiaries  Equitized  Stock's  per audited  Joint Venture/Associates  Equitized  Stock's  ownership \n(Y/N) name (Y/N) name per audited \nreport\nreport\n1.

The effectiveness of the SCIC has been limited by the (i) lack of explicit criteria for \nhanding over state interests in large enterprises and general corporations, which is done on a \ncase-by-case basis by the Prime Minister's office; (ii) potential for conflict between SCIC and \nline ministries that reserve the right to appoint key people to the boards of management of \nequitized SOEs; (iii) inadequate regulatory framework on financial management in SCIC; (iv) \nlack of a clear strategy and role for SCIC; and (v) lack of training and inadequate institutional \ncapacity in SCIC to manage investments and improve governance in the equitized SOEs. \n \n23.  Developing a clear strategy and role for SCIC is part of a vigorous, ongoing internal \ndebate in the Government on how the state's assets in SOEs should be managed in the future. \nThe particular trajectory of SOE reform in the past has left SCIC far from its envisaged role, \nsaddled with many small SOEs with dysfunctional assets, even as it is unable to meaningfully \nabsorb the state capital in the large general corporations to be transformed, some of which are \nseveral  times  larger  than  SCIC.  Independent  of  the  specific  alternative  decided  by  the \nGovernment, regarding both the management of its assets in SOEs broadly and specifically \nSCIC, implementation will require significant time, resources, and capacity development. The \nSRCGFP is well positioned to facilitate this process over the medium term. \n \n4.  Rationale \n24.  Country strategy. SOE transformation and reform is critical to reducing the dominance \nof inefficient state production, promoting private sector development, and enhancing economic \ngrowth. The slow progress of SOE equitization is disappointing. Yet the continued and declared \ncommitment of the Government to SOE reform over several years has reduced by more than \n50% the number of SOEs, starting from a base of more than 12,000 such enterprises in 1990. \nMost recently, the Government's Socio-Economic Development Plan (SEDP) 2006\u20132010 calls \nfor diversifying ownership to improve the efficiency and competitiveness of SOEs. In addition to \nexpanding  the  scale  and  scope  of  SOE  equitization,  the  SEDP  envisages  narrowing  and \neliminating the role of ministries and other state entities in SOE governance and management. \nThe Government issued in November 2006 a master plan to support the process of SOE \nreforms in 2006\u20132010,8 which was followed in December 2006 by Decision 1729/QD-TTg from \nthe Prime Minister, which explicitly identified and listed general corporations for equitization by \n2010. Since achievement has fallen far short of targets, the Government is reviewing the \nimplementation status of its plans for SOE reforms and will need to develop another medium-\nterm plan for the period beyond 2010. In July 2009, the Prime Minister issued directive 854/CT-\nTTg directing NSCERD, in collaboration with relevant agencies, to report to the Politburo by the \nend  of  the  2009  5-year  and  10-year  plans  on  how  to  restructure  and  reorganize  general \ncorporations and other SOEs to make them regionally and globally competitive. \n \n25.  ADB strategy. ADB strategy towards the SOE sector in Viet Nam has two defining \ncharacteristics:  long-term  support  and  responsiveness.  ADB  has  been  engaged  with  SOE \nreform since early on, with approval of the SOE Reform and Corporate Governance Program in \n1999 supported by an Asian Development Fund (ADF) loan for $57 million equivalent and an \nordinary capital resources (OCR) loan for $40 million.9 Two technical assistance (TA) projects \nwere  provided  to  facilitate  program  implementation. 10  Following  program  completion  in \n                                                 \n8  Prime Minister's Decision No. 263/2006/QD-TTg.  \n9  ADB. 1999.

The country strategy and program called for continued SOE reforms to \nreduce barriers to private sector development, corruption, and the misuse of public resources \nand to enhance transparency and corporate governance. \n \n26.  Responsive approach. ADB's approach to SOEs has been responsive to the evolving \ncontours of the long reform process, which has been both complex and sensitive in Viet Nam, \noften requiring consensus at the highest levels of decision making. ADB's first loan addressed \nprevailing constraints, including the creation of a centralized government institution to formulate, \ncoordinate,  and  lead  the  implementation  of  SOE  reforms;  adoption  of  a  modern  law  on \nenterprises; divestiture of small enterprises and gradual reduction in shareholding in large and \nmedium-sized SOEs; and promotion of commercialization of operations. A decade later, the \ncontext of SOE reform has altered, and new needs have emerged. While thousands of SOEs \nhave been equitized, the remaining equitization and transformation is the more difficult part, \nconcentrated  primarily  in  general  corporations.  Most  general  corporations  have  completed \nequitizing many of their subsidiaries, but the equitization of the general corporation itself has \nproved to be a thorny problem. SOE reform is stymied by the lack of viable approaches to \nequitizing and transforming large general corporations. Through the SRCGFP, ADB is again \nintroducing  a  timely  catalyst  into  the  SOE  reform  process  by  proposing  a  comprehensive \napproach  to  successfully  equitize  general  corporations  and  transform  them  into  globally \ncompetitive entities. \n  \n27.  Comprehensive approach needed, including listing. Equitization is only one step in a \nsuccessful transformation process for SOEs and needs to be complemented, even preceded, by \na  host  of  other  steps,  including  strategic  and  business  planning,  corporate  and  financial \nrestructuring,  attracting  investment  and  corporate  financing,  forming  value-adding  business \npartnerships  or  alliances,  and  implementing  more  transparent  governance.  Enhancing  the \nmarket education of management and staff, modernizing management information systems and \nhuman  resource  development  systems,  and  possibly  listing  on  the  stock  exchange  are \nadditional steps and challenges that need to be addressed for effective and comprehensive \ntransformation.  Clarifying  the  roles  of  owners  and  management,  improving  corporate \ngovernance, developing financing accountability, and developing a focused business strategy \nare substantial challenges for most general corporations. The logical culmination of effective \nenterprise restructuring and transformation should be listing on the exchange. \n \n28.  Demonstrative role. Successfully transforming selected general corporations in the first \nstage of the proposed facility will provide a strong demonstration and a workable model for \nundertaking  the  transformation  of  other  general  corporations  and  thereby  benefit  the  SOE \nreform process. This is well appreciated by MOF. To address qualitative aspects of SOE reform, \nthe  proposed  model  goes  beyond  mere  equitization  to  comprehensive  transformation  of \nparticipating  general  corporations,  combining  refocused  business  strategy  and  operational \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2006.

Due to delays in approvals from the Government, \nTA implementation started in July 2008. \n12 The PRSC programs comprise several closely related activities jointly undertaken each year by development \nagencies to help the Government carry out policy reforms needed to successfully implement its poverty-reduction \nstrategy. The World Bank coordinates PRSC activities. ADB joined the PRSC process in 2003 and has taken part \nin all PRSC activities since then. See ADB. 2008.

Manila (September). \n ", " 8 \nrestructuring, improved governance, and corporate and debt restructuring to strengthen the \ngeneral corporation balance sheet.  \n \n29.  Selection  of  general  corporations.  The  complexity  of  successfully  and \ncomprehensively  transforming  a  large  SOE  makes  it  important  to  keep  the  pilot  stage \nmanageable by focusing on a select few. Equally important, it is critical that the selected general \ncorporations themselves be fully and demonstrably committed to transformation, particularly in \nsenior and middle management. Finally, it is critical that the Government be a partner in the \neffort and receptive to the outcomes and lessons of the pilot initiative for broader SOE reform. \nThe Government needs to have unequivocal ownership in selecting the general corporations, \ntheir transformation program, and the outcomes and lessons. After consulting with several \ngeneral corporations, the Government proposed an initial list of four general corporations for \npotential participation in the SRCGFP, from which two  have been selected for the first tranche. \nThe selection was based on the viability of debt restructuring and readiness, reflected in the \nexpressed  commitment  to  undertaking  appropriate  corporate,  financial,  and  operational \nrestructuring and approval from the general corporation's board of management and the line \nministries concerned of the proposed restructuring. For future tranches, the participation of \ngeneral corporations in the SRCGFP will be guided by (i) commitment and willingness to reform \non the part of the general corporations themselves, their line ministries or agencies, and the \nGovernment;  (ii)  the  relevance  of  the  general  corporations  to  ADB's  country  and  sector \nstrategies and to the Government's plans and strategy for the SOE sector; and (iii) the financial \nviability of the general corporations after restructuring, including their potential for listing.14  \n \n30.  Lessons. Experience in the SOE sector has shown that strong corporate governance \nand financial discipline are essential to developing the private sector and capital markets. As the \neconomy transforms and becomes more market based, these aspects need to be upgraded \ncontinuously, including through assistance in adopting corporate governance practices across \nthe state and private sectors. Important factors in the success of the previous loan and TA for \nSOE  reform  were  awareness  and  knowledge  of  the  sociopolitical  environment  and \nsensitivities.15 Ownership  of  the  project  should  be  ensured  during  design.  The  proposed \ninitiatives  should  be  viewed  by  the  Government  and  its  implementing  agencies  (IAs)  as \ncomplementing their own reform efforts. ADB's experience with reform in Viet Nam has shown \nclearly that complex reforms require time and persistence, and that substantial learning and \ncapacity  building  are  needed  at  various  stages  of  reform.  Extensive  consultations  were \nundertaken with the Government in developing the SRCGFP, with numerous presentations \nmade at all the agencies participating in the first stage. At general corporations, proposed \ninitiatives for corporate and operational restructuring were presented to middle management \nand senior management, including boards of management. \n \n31.  Multitranche financing facility. The Government has requested ADB to support the \nreform and transformation of general corporations and the strengthening of institutions related to \nreforming SOEs. MFF is the appropriate modality for the SRCGFP for various reasons. Viet \nNam's  strategy  and  experience  in  transforming  SOEs  has  the  appearance  to  date  of  an \nexcessively long fuse. Much of the state's capital remains unaffected several years after the \n                                                 \n14 In August 2009, the Ministry of Construction submitted a proposal to the Prime Minister for consolidating five other \ngeneral corporations in construction into an economic group managed by Song Da, which is participating in the first \ntranche of the SRCGFP. This initiative is positive recognition of the steps being taken by Song Da, is fully \nconsistent with the measures proposed under the SRCGFP, and strengthens the rationale for the program. The \nfirst tranche of the SRCGFP will restructure Song Da, which will be the core of an expanded Song Da under the \nproposal of the Ministry of Construction. The expanded entity could be further supported under the next tranche.  \n15 ADB. 2004. Program Completion Report: State-Owned Enterprise Reform and Corporate Governance Program \nViet Nam. Manila. \n ", "                   9\nfuse  was  lit.  Absent  meaningful  progress  in  restructuring  general  corporations,  there  is  a \npossibility that the SOE reform process may go dormant at least over the medium term. The \npresent juncture of the reform process, considering the complexity and difficulty of SOE reform \nin Viet Nam, requires both flexibility and commitment. This context informs the rationale for MFF \nas the most appropriate lending modality for the SRCGFP. It can allow the SRCGFP to benefit \nfrom flexibly adapting to lessons from the first stage by refining the approach for general \ncorporation equitization and transformation, as well as to important longer-term decisions the \nGovernment will take relating to the pace and scope of general corporation equitization and the \nrole of institutions addressing critical functions, such as debt resolution and the management of \nstate capital. A program loan cluster would be less able to address the needed flexibility and \ncommitment of long-term ADB involvement because of its emphasis on policy conditions, while \nwhat is needed are resources for SOE restructuring. A sector development loan would also be \nless appropriate because of the diversity of sector coverage envisioned under the SRCGFP. \n \n32.  Credibility. The sustained ADB support for SOE reform over the long haul signaled by \nthe MFF will be significant not only for the Government, but also for other donors and potential \ninvestors in the sector. The commitment conveyed in the longer MFF horizon will facilitate \ndeeper ADB engagement with the Government as it plans and implements the next phase of \nSOE  reform.  This  engagement  could  be  broadened  through  ADB  interacting  with  the \nGovernment on program-related policy reforms for the SOE sector under the annual PRSC \nprocess. \n \n33.  Multitranche financing facility requirements. The SRCGFP fulfills the requirements \nfor using the MFF modality. As MFF requirements are oriented towards projects that undertake \nphysical investments, the present facility is atypical, since there is no creation of new physical \nassets.  It  is  instead  an  equitization  and  restructuring  project  geared  to  facilitate  the \nGovernment's longstanding program for transforming its large SOEs and general corporations. \nThis will require implementation by many enterprises under several ministries and agencies of \nthe Government. The SRCGFP is thus an innovative expansion in the scope of MFF modality in \nterms of applicability. \n \n34.  Road map. The Government has a road map for transforming the SOE sector through \nequitization, seeking to combine or follow equitization with listing, attracting new capital into \nSOEs, increasing their efficiency, and narrowing the role of the state in SOE management. The \nroad map is supported by policy and legal frameworks. As part of its road map, the Government \ninitially focused on equitizing smaller SOEs to test and refine the process. Subsequently, the \nGovernment  aggregated  many  SOEs  into  general  corporations  and  sought  to  define  and \ndevelop a parent\u2013subsidiary company model for them. The Government has since focused on \nequitizing and transforming general corporations, while identifying with greater clarity areas or \nsectors  that  it  intends  to  retain  under  full  control  (e.g.,  those  deemed  to  be  of  strategic \nimportance, such as defense and telecommunications). In others, while mostly retaining its \nstated objective of majority ownership even in listed entities, the Government has also relaxed \nthe ceiling shares of private investors, including foreign investors. Equitizing and transforming \ngeneral corporations is the next challenge. The Prime Minister\u2019s decision 263/2006/QD-TTg \nprovided a plan for 2007\u20132010 for equitizing general corporations in terms of the year specific \ngeneral corporations would be equitized, but it is unlikely that the target of even narrowly \ndefined  equitization  of  all  general  corporations  will  be  achieved  by  2010.  Comprehensive \ntransformation  of  the  large  general  corporations  into  efficient,  competitive  corporations \nmaximizing value for shareholders is likely to take substantially more time and resources. The \nPrime Minister has now issued directive 854/CT-TTg, dated 19 June 2009, asking NSCERD to \ninitiate a review of SOE reforms to date and to prepare a plan aligned with the next SEDP, to \n2015. Based on the review and assessment of reforms, the Prime Minister's directive asks for \n ", " 10 \nproposals to improve SOE management efficiency and profitability after equitization. The broad \nelements of the plan are likely to remain consistent with the existing road map, equitizing all \nremaining  SOEs  and  general  corporations,  seeking  to  combine  equitization  with  listing, \nattracting  new  capital  into  the  state  enterprises,  and  increasing  production  and  business \nefficiency. \n \n35.  Strategic  context  and  policy  framework.  SOE  reform  has  been  a  significant \ncomponent  of  the  national  strategy  and  ADB  strategy.  The  impact  and  outcomes  of  the \nproposed  facility  are  consistent  with  the  country  partnership  strategy  for  Viet  Nam.  The \nGovernment\u2019s  vision  has  been  clearly  articulated  as  aiming  to  reorganize,  renew,  and \nrestructure  SOEs  to  improve  their  efficiency,  adaptability  to  market  mechanisms,  and \ncompetitiveness  in  the  context  of  global  economic  integration.  The  Government's  policy \nframework endorses the principle of eliminating the role of line ministries in managing SOEs; \nseparating  the  ownership  and  management  of  general  corporations;  and  enhancing  their \ntransparency, accountability, professionalism, and operational efficiency. The Government has \nalso developed a comprehensive legal framework for SOE reform (see para. 3). The policy \nframework will nevertheless need to be strengthened as SOE reform gradually moves into the \npost-equitization phase. In particular, the Government will need to review the framework for \nownership of the state's interest in economic organizations to facilitate the necessary separation \nof ownership from management of large SOEs and general corporations. There is a need to \nreview  and  reestablish  the  role  and  structure  of  the  SCIC  as  the  holder  of  the  state\u2019s \ninvestments in economic organizations to help enhance accountability, transparency, and the \nimplementation of governance processes. \n \n36.  Investment program. The SRCGFP will support general corporations under various \nministries  at  different  stages  of  readiness.  Their  investment  requirements  will  need  to  be \nassessed, including for operational restructuring, and these needs will depend on what the \nproposed  new  structures  are.  An  investment  program  has  been  estimated  based  on  an \nassessment  of  available  data  on  the  financing  needs  of  general  corporations  that  may \nreasonably be expected to undergo transformation in the medium term, until 2015. A third of the \nestimated financing requirements of $1.77 billion will be generated from general corporations \nand  strategic  investors,  with  the  remaining  resources  divided  roughly  evenly  between  the \nGovernment and ADB. \n \n37.  Development Partner Coordination. The importance of successful SOE reform to the \neconomy generated significant development partner interest in the sector, particularly during \n2000\u20132005  (see  Appendix  3).  Danish  International  Development  Aid  (DANIDA)  and  the \nDepartment for International Development of the United Kingdom provided capacity building and \nother technical support to NSCERD until 2004. The International Finance Corporation supported, \nalong with DANIDA, the pilot equitization and restructuring of SOEs, and the World Bank was \ninvolved with support for labor redundancy issues in restructured SOEs until 2005. The World \nBank administered a large project to support the auditing of 100 major SOEs during 2001\u20132005, \nwhich was also funded by the European Union and DANIDA. Several development partners, \nincluding the French, Swiss, and German aid agencies, have been active with the reforms of \nSOCBs. SOE reform is always discussed in the context of the annual PRSC process led by the \nWorld  Bank  and  supported  by  a  number  of  development  partners  including  ADB.  The \nConsultative Group meetings on Viet Nam held twice a year always include SOE reform as part \nof the agenda. ADB has participated in the Article IV consultation mission of the International \nMonetary Fund, which is also engaged in policy dialog with the Government on SOE reforms. \nHowever, development partner participation in the SOE sector at the project level has waned in \nrelative terms in recent years; the present support from ADB is thus a timely initiative for \npromoting the reform of the SOE sector. \n ", "                   11\nIII.  THE PROPOSED FACILITY \n38.  The facility for up to $600 million in OCR and $30 million in ADF resources will directly \nsupport the Government's agenda for SOE reform and transformation through a comprehensive \npackage involving the strengthening of general corporation balance sheets through corporate \nand financial restructuring and enhancing operational efficiency and corporate governance.16 \nDebt  restructuring  will  enable  general  corporations  to  strengthen  their  balance  sheets  by \nswapping high-cost, short-term loans for cheaper, longer-term debt, thereby improving cash flow \nand  their  debt-servicing  capacity,  freeing  resources  for  productive  activities.  Corporate \nrestructuring will enable participating general corporations to exploit economies of both scale \nand scope by merging several small joint stock subsidiaries into larger entities organized along \nthe same lines of business, combined with divestiture of non-core business units. Additionally, \noperational efficiency will be enhanced by management restructuring to strengthen corporate \nmanagement processes and improve governance (see Figure 2). The thrust of the SRCGFP is \nimproved profitability and efficiency in general corporations from operational restructuring, which \nis the main source of the Program's economic benefits. At the same time, debt restructuring is \ncrucial to enhancing the financial viability of restructured enterprises. OCR will be used to \nsupport  financial  and  corporate  restructuring,  while  operational  restructuring  and  improved \ncorporate governance will be supported by the complementary loan component funded from \nADF resources. The facility will also provide support for institutions and agencies playing key \nroles in facilitating SOE reform. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n39.  By enhancing SOE reform, the proposed SRCGFP will improve the profitability and \ntransparency of equitized and restructured SOEs, including large general corporations and their \nsubsidiaries.  Enhanced  SOE  profitability  will  augment  the  state's  financial  resources  for \ndevelopment  and  facilitate  improved  policies  for  increasing  the  market  orientation  of  the \neconomy. The expected outcome will be the transformation of several general corporations and \ntheir subsidiaries into focused, efficient businesses with strong balance sheets and improved \ncorporate  governance.  By  developing  a  successful  and  sustainable  model  for  general \ncorporation transformation, the SRCGFP will renew direction and focus for further SOE reform. \n \nB.  Outputs \n40.  The SRCGFP has three main outputs to support SOE reform: (i) restructuring general \ncorporation  debt  through  financial  and  corporate  restructuring;  (ii)  increased  operational \nefficiency and improved corporate governance in participating general corporations; and (iii) \nstrengthening and enhancing the governance of institutions supporting key aspects of SOE \nreform, particularly those facilitating the resolution of nonperforming debts and managing state \ncapital in SOEs.17 \n                                                 \n16 Three types of restructuring are discussed. First, corporate restructuring deals with techniques such as debt\u2013equity \nswaps, capital reductions, new share issues, etc., that change the corporate structure to make it more efficient. \nSecond, financial restructuring generally refers to rescheduling debts, debt forgiveness, debt reclassification, and \nother  techniques  that  address  the  company\u2019s  ability  to  make  principal  and  interest  payments.  Corporate \nrestructuring and financial restructuring are jointly referred to here as debt restructuring. Lastly, management or \noperational restructuring addresses issues such as product quality, product lines, production capability, marketing \nstrategies, production techniques, personnel issues, management changes, and other changes in the operations of \nthe company. \n17 The Government has yet to decide on the future role of SCIC. Alternative models for managing equitized state \ncapital are being debated within the Government, and no decision is likely before 2010 at the earliest. The facility \ncan provide support in subsequent tranches to SCIC or any alternative considered by the Government for \nmanaging state capital in SOEs.  \n ", " 12 \n \n41.  Debt restructuring. To address excessively high debt-to-equity ratios and the resulting \npoor cash flows, the participating general corporations will restructure and strengthen their \nbalance sheets through financial and corporate restructuring. Expensive, short-term debt will be \nconverted into long-term debt with lower interest rates, improving cash flows. Loans identified \nfor  restructuring  can  be  to  either  general  corporations  or  their  subsidiaries,  but  no \nnonperforming loans will be restructured. Further, corporate restructuring will strengthen general \ncorporation balance sheets while enabling them to exploit economies of scale and scope. All \nsubsidiary companies engaged in the same strategic business will be grouped under sub-\nholding  companies  to  be  established  via  share  swap  and/or  buyback  arrangements. \nSubsequent tranches of the facility may consider the use of equity financing and guarantees to \nfacilitate debt restructuring in participating general corporations. \n \n \nFigure 2:  General Corporation Transformation under SRCGFP \n \nComprehensive review of financial and \n \noperational parameters; identify core business \nareas; analyze strengths and weaknesses; and \nPreparation for participation \ndevelop a plan to strengthen balance sheet, \n \nin SRCGFP \nbusiness processes, and corporate governance \n \nApproval of the transformation plan by apex \nentity, line ministries, MOF, and the Prime \nMinister\u2019s Office \n \n  Financial restructuring, included debt resolution \nand asset reclassification; corporate \n \nrestructuring; and operations restructuring \n \n(supported by ADB loans) \n \n \n  Sub-holding companies aligned with core \nbusiness areas created that are equitized/ \n \nalready listed; general corporation becomes  SRCGFP \n  pure investment holding company  participation and \n  support \n \nPost-restructuring strengthening  \n(corporate governance, MIS, business strategy,   \ntraining)   \n \n \nEfficient, competitive and profitable general \ncorporation with access to capital markets;   \nListing on stock exchange if necessary   \n \nMIS = management information system, MOF = Ministry of Finance, SOE = state-owned enterprise. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n \n42.  Operational  restructuring  and  enhanced  corporate  governance.  Comprehensive \noperational  or  management  restructuring  will  complement  debt  restructuring  to  enhance \nefficiency  and  corporate  governance  in  general  corporations,  which  will  refocus  business \noperations by  defining  limited  core  business  lines,  create  sub-holding  companies  for  each \nbusiness line, and divest non-core operations. Existing subsidiaries will be organized into sub-\n ", "                   13\nholding companies, and the charter of sub-holding companies will be aligned with the provisions \nof the model charter issued by MOF upon listing. Management of companies engaged in the \nsame industry will be centralized in sub-holding companies. Consistent management practices \nand business processes will be introduced across the group, and financial and management \nreporting  and  information  technology  systems  will  be  standardized.  Guidelines  and  best \npractices will be introduced for internal audit and enterprise risk management, and manuals and \nstandard procedures will be established for all key processes. Human resource systems will be \nmodernized, and capacity will be built by training workers and managers in key areas like \ncorporate governance, enterprise risk management, and project management.  \n \n43.  Institutional  development. The SRCGFP will strengthen institutions supporting key \naspects  of  SOE  reform  and  improve  their  governance,  such  as  institutions  facilitating  the \nresolution of nonperforming debts and managing state capital in the SOE sector. ADF lending \nwill  be  used  under  tranche  1  to  (i)  develop  a  training  program  for  DATC  personnel  and \nenterprises  under  DATC;  (ii)  organize  training  on  debt  resolution,  corporate  restructuring, \ncorporate governance, and investment analysis and management; (iii) develop an appropriate \norganizational structure with job descriptions for each management position; (iv) establish an \ninternal  audit  and  develop  best  practices  and  guidelines;  and  (v)  develop  and  implement \nenterprise risk-management processes. \n \nC.  Special Features \n44.  Onlending  by  the  Government.  Loans  under  the  facility  will  be  provided  to  the \nGovernment of Viet Nam for onlending to general corporations and other institutions. Loans \nfrom ADB\u2019s OCR will be used to strengthen general corporations' balance sheets through \ncorporate and financial restructuring. Loans from ADF will also be onlent, but for carrying out \nmanagement restructuring to improve operational efficiency and corporate governance. For the \nloan from OCR, the Government will onlend the full amount of the ADB loans to participating \ngeneral corporations in the same currency as in the primary loan agreement between ADB and \nthe Government. The subsidiary loans between the Government and the participating general \ncorporations will have the same terms as the primary loans from ADB to the Government, plus \nother costs determined by the Government and acceptable to ADB. ADB can help general \ncorporations to mitigate the exchange and interest risks through London interbank offered rate \n(LIBOR)-based  lending  conversion  options,  subject  to  the  necessary  approvals  from  the \nGovernment and appropriate market conditions. Implementation arrangements will generally \nensure that the funds used for financial restructuring will be transferred, following endorsement \nby MOF, directly from ADB to the creditor banks of the participating general corporations. \n \n45.  Corporate  restructuring  of  general  corporations.  A  general  corporation  will  first \ndefine its strategic focus for each business segment it is engaged in and then establish a sub-\nholding company for each of identified business segments and align all subsidiary companies \nengaged in the same industry under it. The sub-holding company can be an existing wholly \nowned  subsidiary  or  an  existing  listed  subsidiary.  The  sub-holding  company  will  align  the \ncompanies engaged in the same industry under it by merging the operation of subsidiaries via \nshare swaps or buybacks. The general corporation will push down all its existing businesses to \nsubsidiaries and consider divesting its investments in non-strategic businesses. This will result \nin the general corporations\u2019 only business being holding investments in sub-holding companies \n(Figure 3). \n \n \n \n \n ", " 14 \n \nFigure 3: Proposed Operational Restructuring of General Corporations under the SRCGFP \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGC = general corporation. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n \n46.  Operational  restructuring.  Participating  general  corporations  will  centralize  the \nmanagement of companies engaged in the same industry and operate with a common strategic \nfocus by pooling executives engaged in a particular industry into the sub-holding company. The \nsub-holding company will be the management agent for wholly owned subsidiaries. If it is not \npossible  to  appoint  the  sub-holding  company  as  the  management  agent  for  partly  owned \nsubsidiaries,  personnel  from  the  sub-holding  company  will  be  seconded  to  manage  the \nsubsidiary's operations. Based on the strategic direction set by the general corporation, the sub-\nholding company will establish standard procedures and processes for each business segment \nand define and develop strategies for all subsidiaries. Companies within a subgroup will operate \nwith a common strategic focus, eliminate duplication of resources and conflict of interest, and \nenjoy economies of scale, thus maximizing value (box). \n \n47.  Capital market development. The post-restructuring sub-holding companies depicted \nin Figure 3 are joint stock companies, some of which may already be listed. The outcome of the \nrestructuring will thus be a general corporation comprising subgroups of companies that can \noperate independently; secure financial resources from the market on their own, without having \nto rely on support from the Government; and meet all quantitative and qualitative conditions for \neventual  listing.  The  equitization  of  the  general  corporation  is  thus  achieved  through  the \nequitization or even listing of the sub-holding companies. By listing the sub-holding companies, \nthe general corporations will be able to source financing on their own, thus relieving the state of \nfurther financial burden.18 In essence, general corporations will have helped shift credit risk off \nMOF and the Government onto the market. The creation of such large iconic enterprises listed \nin  the  local  bourses  will  increase  the  supply  of  quality  securities  and  aggregate  market \n                                                 \n18 SOE finances, including the MOF's onlending to them, are off budget. However, MOF includes its onlending to \nSOEs in off-budget expenditure and lending in the budget reports. Once equitized, SOEs will come under \nEnterprise Law and be treated like any other enterprise. The Government's contingent liabilities arising from \nownership of SOEs and SOCBs are likely to be far less than the Government's share of assets. \n ", "                   15\ncapitalization, develop the capital market, attract local and foreign investors\u2019 interest, and build \ntheir confidence. \n \n \nBox:  Select Elements of General Corporation Corporate and Operational Restructuring \n \nCorporate restructuring \n \n- Define the key business segments. \n \n- Identify sub-holding companies for each segment. \n- Establish strategic direction of various sub-holding companies.   \n- Consolidate similar business units under a single sub-holding company by means that include share   \nswaps and buybacks, which will need share valuation and valuation of general corporation assets to   \nbe transferred to subsidiaries, special audits, and appointment of merchant bankers. \n \n- Identify non-strategic holdings in associated companies for disposal. \n   \nManagement restructuring \n \nStrategic planning  \n- Develop a strategic plan for each business segment.   \n- Establish budget and forecast and key performance indicators.   \nImprove management structure \n \n- Develop an appropriate organization chart in line with the new corporate structure. \n \n- Develop descriptions of jobs and responsibilities for each executive position in the general corporation, \nsub-holding companies, and subsidiaries under the new management structure.   \n- Develop and implement financial reporting of subsidiaries to sub-holding companies and from sub-  \nholding to holding companies.   \n- Devise improvements to the financial closing process with a view to addressing all audit qualifications, \n \nshortening the period to prepare monthly management and financial reports and annual financial \n \nstatements of the general corporation, and all business segments. \nImprove corporate governance   \n- Undertake diagnostic review and propose improvements.   \n- Introduce a manual and procedures for the board of management. \n \n- Develop a manual for corporate policies and procedures. \n \n- Promulgate a code of ethics for directors, managers, and staff and set qualitative criteria for \nrecruitment and performance evaluation.   \n- Introduce best practices and guidelines for internal audit and risk management.   \n- Train staff on corporate governance.   \nHuman resource development \n \n- Introduce a staff competency model and learning map for all levels in all segments. \n \n- Train staff. \nImproved information management system   \n \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n \n48.  No new physical investments. No direct investment of funds is expected from the \nGovernment  to  further  general  corporation  transformation  under  the  SRCGFP.  Instead, \nresources will come from other sources such as the internal funds of the general corporations \nthemselves,  capital  markets,  outside  investors,  and  donors.  The  investment  plan  for  the \nSRCGFP  addresses  general  corporations  that  have  indicated  or  will  indicate  interest  in \nparticipating in the facility. Four general corporations have already indicated interest, of which \ntwo have confirmed participation in the first tranche and two others have indicated readiness in \nthe subsequent tranche. The first tranche of the SRCGFP is intended as a pilot to demonstrate \ntransformation models that work and that can be replicated across other large SOEs. The \ninvestment plan of the SRCGFP is, to that extent, endogenous to the implementation of the \nfacility, as the extent to which general corporation transformation in the pilot is a demonstrated \nsuccess  will  clearly  affect  the  interest  and  commitment  of  other  general  corporations  to \nparticipate in the facility. Similarly, the financing plan, particularly the role of capital markets and \noutside investors, will be endogenous to SRCGFP implementation. \n \n ", " 16 \n49.  Public debt sustainability. The most recent debt-sustainability analysis,19 conducted \njointly by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank with ADB participation, notes that \npublic and publicly guaranteed external debt is likely to remain manageable, while domestic \npublic debt management may become more challenging due to the increase in ratios of debt \nservice to revenue, reflecting lower oil revenues over the medium term. A special risk is posed \nby contingent liabilities associated with SOCBs and SOEs that have traditionally relied on \nborrowing from SOCBs. An earlier analysis simulating SOCBs losses on the order of 8% of \ngross  domestic  product,  which  would  require  an  issuance  of  government  bonds  for \nrecapitalization, found this would not undermine debt sustainability over the medium term but \nwould affect the dynamics of debt, interest rates, and other variables. 20  This result is robust for \nmore extreme scenarios of possible SOCB losses. The latest debt-sustainability analysis also \nconfirms that an increase in debt-creating flows by 10 percentage points of gross domestic \nproduct would not destabilize the debt profile over the longer term. \n \nD.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n50.  Total SOE sector investment needs for equitizing general corporations and large SOEs \nare estimated at $1.77 billion equivalent over 2009\u20132015, as shown in Table 2.

The Government has requested up to $630 million equivalent through an MFF to help \nfinance the SRCGFP. The MFF will comprise up to $600 million equivalent from ADB's OCR. \nADB will use OCR to support financial and corporate restructuring in participating general \ncorporations.21 All provisions of ordinary loan regulations applicable to ADB's LIBOR-based \nloans will apply to each loan, subject to modifications, if any, that  may be agreed in the \nframework financing agreement (FFA), supplemented by any loan and project agreements. The \nGovernment has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions and (ii) an undertaking \nthat  these  choices  were  its  own  independent  decision  and  not  made  in  reliance  on  any \ncommunication or advice from ADB. The Government will onlend the full amount of ADB's OCR \nloan to participating general corporations. The onlending from the Government to the general \ncorporations will be in the same currency as in the primary loan from ADB to the Government \nand  match  ADB's  lending  terms  for  the  Government,  plus  other  costs  determined  by  the \n                                                 \n19 IMF. 2008.

No new physical assets will be \ncreated from the OCR component of the facility, which will be lent to general corporations \nthrough MOF to restructure their existing debt and thereby enhance cash flows and strengthen \nbalance sheets. The loans will be a relatively small proportions of general corporations\u2019 total \nassets and liabilities.  For example, tranche 1 will support 2 general corporations, Song Da and \nSouthern Waterborne Transport Corporation (Sowatco), through OCR loans of $117.5 million \nand $2.5 million. As of 31 December 2007, Song Da's total assets were $1.35 billion and \nliabilities were $971.5 million. Similarly, Sowatco's assets of $48 million were several times the \nproposed loan. Counterpart funding from the general corporations therefore far exceeds the \n90/10 requirement for project financing in Viet Nam. While, under existing regulations, the OCR \nloan will be onlent to the two general corporations in foreign currency, Song Da can mitigate its \nexchange risk with revenues from its current and planned operations in neighboring countries. \n \nTable 3: Financing Plan \n \nAmount  Share of Total \nSource  ($ million)  (%) \n   \nADB Ordinary Capital Resources  600  33.9 \nADB Asian Development Fund  30  1.7 \nGovernmenta  550  31.1 \nGeneral Corporationsb  100  5.6 \nStrategic Investors and/or Othersc  490  27.7 \nTotal  1,770  100.0 \nTranche 1     \nADB Ordinary Capital Resources  120  92.3 \nADB Asian Development Fund  10  7.7 \nTotal  130  100.0 \na  Includes transfer of government ownership in equitized general corporations into the State \nCapital Investment Corporation or its equivalent. \nb  Includes internal resources and capital market and other borrowings. \nc  The demonstrative aspect of first tranche project may attract other donors\u2018 later participation. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n53.  The Government has asked ADB to provide $30 million equivalent from ADF resources \nto  support  operational  restructuring  in  participating  general  corporations  and  to  strengthen \ninstitutions critical to the SOE reforms, such as DATC. The ADF loan under the first tranche of \nthe facility will have the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter; a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those agreed in the FFA, supplemented by \nloan agreements. The Government will onlend the full amount of the ADF loan to participating \nentities in the borrowing currency or in dong, with lending terms the same as those between \nADB and the Government, plus other costs determined by the Government and acceptable to \nADB. The allocation of the ADF resources will be subject to (i) the general availability of ADF \nresources,  (ii)  Viet  Nam's  access  to  such  resources  pursuant  to  ADB'  policy 22 and  the \nrequirements of the ADF donors, and (iii) the availability of such resources to Viet Nam pursuant \nto ADB policy.23 \n \n                                                 \n22 ADB. 1998.

The  MFF  will  consist  of  individual  loans  to  finance  a  range  of  subprojects  in  the \nSRCGFP to equitize and transform general corporations and strengthen institutions supporting \nSOE reforms, subject to the Government's submitting periodic financing requests (PFRs) and \nexecution of related loan and project agreements. Details of the selection criteria for general \ncorporation participation in future tranches and approval procedures are in Appendix 5. The \nGovernment has entered into an FFA with ADB and is required to comply with its requirements. \nPursuant to the FFA, the Government has submitted to ADB the first PFR, comprising an OCR \nloan for $120 million equivalent and an ADF loan for $10 million equivalent.

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Investment Program Management \n55.  MOF  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  (EA)  for  the  facility  and  responsible  for  the \nsupervision and execution of the SRCGFP, including but not confined to preparing the PFR; \ninter-ministry  coordination  as  needed;  program  monitoring  and  evaluation;  and  preparing \nquarterly and annual progress reports. Immediately following the approval of the facility, MOF \nwill establish a program management unit and a facility steering committee (FSC) to monitor the \nimplementation of the SRCGFP. The FSC will consist of representatives of relevant government \nagencies and be headed by the vice minister of MOF. For the first tranche, Song Da, Sowatco, \nand DATC will be the IAs. IAs in subsequent tranches will be participating SOEs, general \ncorporations, and/or Government agencies promoting SOE reform. The first-tranche project \ninvolves comprehensive reforms to be undertaken by both Song Da and Sowatco regarding \ncorporate,  management,  and  financial  restructuring.  The  SRCGFP  will  also  enhance  the \n ", "                   19\noperational  efficiency  of  DATC  in  facilitating  and  supporting  SOE  reform.  Operational \nrestructuring at the three IAs will be facilitated by consultant services and supervised by their \nboards of management. \n \n2.  Subproject Selection, Preparation, and Approval Procedures \n56.  The  preparation  and  appraisal  of  subprojects  to  be  included  in  the  first  PFR  is \ncompleted.  For  subprojects  under  the  subsequent  loans  of  the  SRCGFP,  an  approval \nprocedure, as outlined in Appendix 5, has been agreed. After ADB's approval and subject to any \nmodification  measures  required  by  ADB,  MOF  will  prepare  PFRs  for  ADB  financing.  The \nGovernment will formally submit the PFRs to ADB for further processing. Each PFR will provide \n(i) the required loan amount; (ii) the subprojects and components to be financed under the loan; \n(iii) cost estimates and a financing plan; (iv) implementation arrangements; (v) confirmation of \nthe continuing validity of and adherence to the provisions of the FFA; (vi) confirmation of \ncompliance with provisions under previous loan and project agreements, as appropriate; and \n(vii) other information required under the facility administration memorandum to be prepared \nand agreed by ADB and the Government to facilitate processing and implementing the facility.   \n \n3.  Implementation Period \n57.  The utilization period for the facility will be from December 2009 to 31 December 2015. \nNo PFRs will be accepted after this date, though disbursements of approved PFRs will be \nallowed until the completion of the projects included for implementation in the last PFR. The \nimplementation period of each tranche or loan is expected not to exceed 3 years. \n \n4.  Procurement, Consulting Services, and Disbursement \n58.  The facility will involve two ADB lending sources: (i) OCR loans that will be used solely \nfor  corporate  and  financial  restructuring  in  participating  general  corporations  and  (ii) \nconcessional funding from ADB's ADF window for carrying out management restructuring and \ncapacity building in participating general corporations and other Government institutions related \nto SOE reforms, to enhance their operational efficiency or role in supporting SOE reform. The \nuse of ADF resources will be subject to availability based on changes arising from existing \nproject cycles, annual performance-based allocation, and other considerations. \n \n59.  The  ADF  loan  will  be  used  exclusively  for  operational  restructuring,  enhancing \ngovernance,  and  building  capacity  in  participating  general  corporations  and  institutions. \nExpenses will consist primarily of consulting services to implement restructuring and equipment \nfor information management. In the first stage, ADF proceeds will be used solely for meeting the \nexpenses to be incurred, or incurred within the provisions of retroactive financing of ADB, by \nSong  Da  and  Sowatco  for  undertaking  agreed  management  restructuring  and  corporate \ngovernance strengthening and by DATC for enhancing its operational efficiency, as agreed with \nADB. Except as ADB may otherwise agree, the three IAs shall each establish, immediately after \nthe effective date, an imprest account for the ADF funds, to be managed by the three IAs at a \ncommercial bank acceptable to ADB and to be used solely for the purposes stated above. The \nimprest accounts shall be established, managed, replenished, and liquidated in accordance with \nADB's  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  detailed \narrangements agreed between the Government as the Borrower and ADB. The currency of the \nimprest account shall be US dollars. For each IA during each tranche of the facility, the imprest \namount should not exceed (i) the estimated expenditure to be financed through the imprest \naccount for the next 6 months of project implementation or (ii) the equivalent of 10% of the \nsubsidiary loan amounts to be financed from ADF resources, whichever is less. For each \n ", " 20 \ntranche, claims under retroactive financing for expenditures incurred during the past 12 months \nbefore loan signing will need to be certified by the auditors of the general corporation submitting \nthe claim and endorsed by the Borrower. \n \n60.  All  goods financed  under  the  SRCGFP  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time).24 Consultants will be selected in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). Consulting firms will be selected by quality and cost (80:20). Short-term specialized tasks \ndeemed necessary and arising during or following the implementation of restructuring may be \nundertaken by individual consultants.  \n \n61.  Disbursements will be according to ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook and detailed \narrangements agreed among the Government, EAs, IAs, and ADB. Equipment purchased will \nbe  primarily  for  establishing  or  enhancing  an  information  management  system,  including \nsoftware and hardware and its installation. The size of any single contract for the information \ntechnology system and its component will not exceed $1 million equivalent. Disbursements for \nequipment and services will be made by direct payment and commitment procedures. The \nstatement  of  expenditures  procedure  will  be  used  to  reimburse  eligible  expenditures  and \nliquidate advances to the IAs. Records will be maintained to substantiate the payments made \nthrough statement of expenditures, which will be limited to $100,000 per payment. The IAs will \nprepare withdrawal applications and submit them to MOF for endorsement. \n \n62.  For  the  first  tranche,  OCR  disbursement  will  follow  the  development  of  a  plan  for \noperational restructuring and improved corporate governance and will be based on the debt \nrestructuring schedule of both Song Da and Sowatco, as agreed with ADB. The Government \nbeing the borrower, it will onlend the loan proceeds to Song Da and Sowatco solely for the \npurpose of restructuring their debts. Except as ADB may otherwise agree, ADB will transfer the \nloan proceeds to the creditor banks of the debts to be restructured in the books of Song Da and \nSowatco against valid requests made by Song Da and Sowatco, supported by resolutions from \ntheir boards of management and endorsed by MOF.  \n \n5.  Retroactive Financing \n63.  Under  each  loan  of  the  facility,  except  as  otherwise  agreed  with  ADB,  eligible \nexpenditures incurred before each loan takes effect but not earlier than 12 months before the \nloan agreement is signed, and incurred directly for the purpose of operational and corporate \nrestructuring,  will  qualify  for  retroactive  financing,  up  to  20%  of  the  proposed  loans.  The \nGovernment has been advised that ADB's approval of retroactive financing does not commit \nADB to finance projects under the facility.  \n \n6.  Anticorruption Policy \n64.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  the  EA.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the SRCGFP. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \nloan agreements and bidding documents for the SRCGFP. In particular, all contracts financed \nby ADB in connection with the SRCGFP shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to \n                                                 \n24 A procurement plan is provided in Supplementary Appendix H and in the periodic financing request. \n ", "                   21\naudit and examine the records and accounts of MOF and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, \nand other service providers as they relate to the SRCGFP. \n \n65.  The fiduciary risks of the current public financial management system are assessed as \nmoderate. ADB participated with the World Bank, MOF, and other development partners in \npreparing a country financial accountability assessment update in 2008 that examined budget \ndevelopment,  execution  and  accounting,  internal  and  external  reporting,  internal  controls, \ninternal and external auditing, monitoring and legislative oversight and scrutiny, and financial \naccountability  risks.  Viet  Nam  has  pursued  many  initiatives  to  strengthen  its  financial \nmanagement and accountability arrangements, systems, and controls. Steady progress has \nbeen made in establishing the legislative framework to support PFM reforms. Major public \nfinance management systems are being upgraded and replaced. \n \n66.  A  financial  management  assessment  of  the  IAs  for  tranche  1  found  their  financial \nsystems adequate (Supplementary Appendix G). It assessed each of the three IAs in the key \nareas of staffing and organization of the accounting department; accounting standards, policies \nand procedures; budgeting systems; payment systems; cash and bank policies; safeguards \nover assets; internal and external audits; information systems; and reporting and monitoring.  \n \n67.  The disbursement arrangements ensure that the OCR loans used for restructuring bank \nloans will be paid directly to creditors upon fulfillment of release procedures by the IA and MOF. \nADF loans may be disbursed directly to consultants and other service providers under the direct \npayment procedure.  \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n68.  The  IAs  will  (i)  maintain  accounting,  management  information,  and  financial  control \nsystems acceptable to ADB; (ii) maintain independent auditors from auditing firms licensed to \noperate in Viet Nam and acceptable to ADB and authorize them to submit financial statements \nto  ADB  at  least  annually;  and  (iii)  give  ADB  representatives  access  to  all sites  where  its \nactivities are conducted, as well as to its books, accounts, and records. The deadline for \nsubmitting audited accounts will be 6 months from the end of each fiscal year. A separate audit \nopinion will be issued on the use of the imprest account. \n \n69.  For each tranche of the facility, project progress and performance will be monitored by \nthe FSC, which may draw upon representatives of each of the participating IAs or their line \nministries, if appropriate. The FSC will use a comprehensive system for monitoring project \nperformance. Each IA will submit biannual progress reports to the committee recording (i) \nprogress made, (ii) problems encountered during the review period, (iii) steps taken or proposed \nto remedy the problems, (iv) a proposed program of activities, and (v) progress expected in the \nfollowing 6 months. The committee and MOF will ensure that these reports are submitted to \nADB in a timely manner. Within 6 months of physical completion of a tranche, MOF and the IAs \nwill  submit  to  ADB  a  project  completion  report  describing  (i)  the  progress  of  the  tranche \nsubprojects in terms of the three main components, i.e., corporate, management, and financial \nrestructuring; (ii) the results of capacity building; (iii) a preliminary assessment of the benefits \nachieved; and (iv) other project implementation matters requested by ADB. \n \n8.  Investment Program Reviews \n70.  ADB will field inception missions within 3 months of approval of the loan(s) for each \ntranche  and  at  least  two  review  missions  per  year.  The  Government  and  ADB  will  jointly \nundertake a midterm review of the SRCGFP in 2011 that will focus on (i) program impact, (ii) the \n ", " 22 \noutcomes  of  tranches  implemented  or  under  implementation,  (iii)  progress  on  the  policy \nframework,  (iv)  the  status  of  compliance  with  undertakings  in  the  FFA  and  covenants  in \nindividual loan agreements, and (v) any need for midcourse changes in the scope or schedule \nof the SRCGFP to ensure full achievement of impact. \n \nIV.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Economic and Financial Analyses \n71.  Both general corporations participating in tranche 1 have diversified operations. The \nSong Da group of companies is engaged mainly in four business segments: hydropower plant \nconstruction,  power  trading,  property  development,  and  industrial  production.  Under  the \nproposed corporate restructuring, activities of the general corporation will be shifted to the \nappropriate subsidiaries and the subsidiaries will be grouped under four sub-holding companies. \nEach sub-holding company and its subsidiaries will focus on one of the four business segments, \nwhile the parent general corporation will become more of a holding company. Similarly, Sowatco \nis  engaged  mainly  in  providing  logistics-related  services.  Under  the  proposed  corporate \nrestructuring, the activities of Sowatco will be shifted down to appropriate subsidiaries engaged \nin similar businesses, and non-core activities will be disposed off. Subsequently, Sowatco will \nserve as a holding company with subsidiaries involved in providing logistics-related services, \nranging from port services, bulk handling of rice through buy and sell arrangements, and river \nbarge transport.  \n \n72.  ADB will finance operational restructuring through the ADF loan and corporate and debt \nrestructuring through the OCR loan. There will be no physical investments under ADB lending, \nand no new assets will be created. Many projects at various stages of implementation underlie \nthe debts to be restructured under the SRCGFP. It is thus neither feasible nor meaningful to \ncalculate financial internal rate of return and net present value for each of these projects. \nInstead, return on capital employed for each of the subgroups or sub-holding companies is \ncalculated. The overall financial viability of the restructured Song Da and Sowatco is established \nby appraising the financial position of each of the sub-holding companies and their subsidiaries. \nThe weighted average cost of capital is calculated for each subgroup and compared with the \nreturn on capital employed of the subgroup. Sensitivity to adverse movements on the underlying \nassumptions of each sub-group is also assessed. The analysis shows the financial viability of \neach subgroup will continue to improve over time, as will that of the parent general corporations. \nDetailed financial performance and projections of Song Da and Sowatco are in Appendixes 6 \nand 7 respectively and in the financial analysis in Appendix 8. \n \n73.  The economic analysis has reviewed the macroeconomic context and the sector plans \nand objectives of the Government to assess the project economic rationale and associated \ncosts in the first tranche. The valuation of the costs and benefits of tranche 1 subprojects follows \nADB guidelines,25 comparing the \u201cwith project\u201d and \u201cwithout project\u201d scenarios to assess the \ninvestment from the point of view of the economy. The costs to the society are the investments \nin the subprojects, comprising the costs of debt restructuring and operational restructuring. In \nboth cases, the incremental costs of the project are negligible. The project benefits are mainly \nunlocking  and  unleashing  the  latent  value  of  SOE  assets  through  increased  operational \nefficiency and improved governance. The project restructures the debts of the two general \ncorporations and pays off existing creditor banks. It is impossible at this stage to state the size, \nnature, or timing of economic costs and benefits of the new projects generated by the freed \nresources released into the economy. The ADF loans are not revenue-generating investments \n                                                 \n25 ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n ", "                   23\nper se.  However, their impact is to make the general corporations more efficient by either \nreducing costs, increasing revenues through better selection of projects, or both. The expected \nbenefits  of  the  investment  include  increased  efficiency  of  debt  resolution  in  SOE  reform \nachieved by strengthening DATC.  \n \nB.  Summary of Benefits, Poverty Reduction, and Social Development \n74.  The transformation and reform of the SOE sector is critical to reducing the dominance of \ninefficient state production, promoting private sector development, and enhancing sustainable \neconomic growth in Viet Nam. While the state has an important role to play in guiding economic \ntransformation and development, and even in participating in economic production in a few \ncases, the rationale for state involvement in the direct production of goods and services is \nlimited and narrow. The resulting static and dynamic efficiency losses are well known and \ndocumented. Transforming general corporations will help capture the resulting efficiency gains \nfor higher growth and pave the way for greater rationalization of government policies at the \nsector  level.  To  protect  its  assets  in  general  corporations,  the  state  has  tended  to  adopt \nprotectionist policies towards the general corporations that promote monopolistic power, hinder \ncompetitiveness,  and  curb  private  sector  development.  Greater  competitiveness  in  the \ntransformed general corporations will facilitate the state\u2019s adoption of less restrictive sector and \npricing policies, further enhancing efficiency gains. \n \n75.  General corporation transformation as proposed under the facility will benefit many SOE \nworkers, who were the dominant buyers of shares in the small SOEs equitized earlier. Many of \nthese small SOEs have continued to languish in inefficiency, dependent upon larger SOEs and \ngeneral corporations for their survival. Their shares, often sold in the parallel market, have lost \nvalue and become more illiquid with the downturn in capital markets. The proposed corporate \nrestructuring under the facility will enable many of SOE shareholders to trade their illiquid \nshares of equitized small SOEs for the shares of large, efficient sub-holding companies that \nmay even be listed on the stock exchange. To the extent they are listed, the development of \ncapital markets will benefit from the creation of iconic companies that may shortly evolve into \nblue chip stocks. Finally, strengthening restructured general corporations' balance sheets with \nmore efficient and profitable operations will ameliorate the problem of nonperforming SOCB \nloans to SOEs, thus benefiting the banking system.  \n \nC.  Social and Environment Safeguards \n76.  The SRCGFP is classified environmental category C, with no significant adverse impact \nidentified.  The  SRCGFP  will  entail  no  involuntary  resettlement,  as  it  has  no  investment \ncomponent for creating new physical assets. None of the debt and operational restructuring \nassociated  with  the  facility  will  trigger  any  activity  related  to  indigenous  people  during \nimplementation. \n \n77.  No  significant  direct  impact  on  employment  is  expected.  Normal  growth  in  the \nrestructured companies will be adequate to facilitate the redeployment of any human resources \nrendered otherwise redundant, resulting in right sizing in the near term through growth and \nnormal attrition. While the proposed restructuring measures are expected to be gender neutral, \nwomen are often more vulnerable to adverse employment conditions. The Government will be \nasked to provide assurance in the FFA that appropriate training is provided for redeploying \naffected SOE employees and that the general corporations address training and redeployment \nwith gender neutrality. \n \n ", " 24 \nD.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n78.  The  SRCGFP  assumes  that  the  Government  will  continue  its  commitment  to \ntransitioning towards an increasingly market-based economy. Sustained, successful economic \nperformance of the equitized general corporations will be necessary to maintain Government \ncommitment to transition. Also required are macroeconomic stability and that the effect of the \ncurrent global economic downturn on general corporation be short term. The outcome of the \nSRCGFP assumes that there will be adequate financial resources, including resources from \nwithin SOEs, to support continued restructuring, and that the restructuring process will be \nsupported by the continued strengthening of debt-resolution mechanisms and improvements in \nstate management of its investment capital. Potential risks to the SRCGFP are identified below. \n(i)  Resistance to SOE reform from vested interests. Reforms and initiatives may \nbe  delayed  by  resistance  from  vested  interests  opposed  to  SOE  reforms. \nHowever, this risk is considered modest since the Government's approach so far \nhas  been  sustained,  if  cautious,  commitment  to  pursuing  SOE  reform.  The \nGovernment has indicated it will renew its plan for equitizing large SOEs and \ngeneral corporations and is looking to the SRCGFP to demonstrate a viable and \nsuccessful model and to enhance reform momentum. The Government is aware \nthat  SOE  reform  is  critical  to  successfully  meeting  obligations  arising  from \nagreements  entered  into  during  the  country's  accession  to  the  World  Trade \nOrganization. The Government has provided specific assurances to mitigate this \nrisk, such as developing the new plan and ensuring that participating general \ncorporations will adhere to SRCGFP-proposed restructuring. \n(ii)  Use of general corporations for noneconomic objectives. The equitized and \ntransformed general corporations may be hindered in operating profitably if the \nGovernment uses them for noneconomic objectives by, for example, applying \nprice controls at the sector level or requiring general corporations to undertake \nnoncommercial activities. However, sustained use of such measures would be \nagainst the Government's interest in transforming inefficient SOEs. The proposed \noperational  restructuring  under  the  facility  would  confine  noncommercial \nactivities,  if  any,  to  general-corporation  level,  which  would  make  them  more \ntransparent  and  distinct  from  the  commercial  operations  of  the  sub-holding \ncompanies. In addition, ADB is engaged in policy dialog on SOE reform with the \nGovernment through the PRSC process. \n(iii)  Inadequate framework for state capital management. SCIC, which currently is \nresponsible for managing state investments, is limited by capacity constraints. It \nis much smaller than many of the large general corporations, which are therefore \nreluctant to place themselves under SCIC following equitization. If Government \nownership of equitized general corporations is not transferred to SCIC or an \nequivalent institution, line ministries and other agencies may continue to have \nsome direct control in their management, even after they are equitized. However, \nthe Government is aware of the need to address this issue and actively engaged \nin a vigorous internal debate to identify and assess options for strengthening the \nmanagement  of  state  capital.  A  decision  is  expected  in  the  near  future. \nSubsequent  tranches  may  support  institutional  development  for  effective \nmanagement of state capital. \n(iv)  Operational restructuring in general corporations may be too complex. The \noperational restructuring needed in general corporations is quite comprehensive \nand may prove too complex for the senior management to implement effectively, \ncompromising the quality of outcomes. To mitigate this risk, general corporations \nwill recruit reputed management consultants to help implement restructuring. In \naddition,  the  proposed  restructuring  has  been  spelled  out  for  the  general \n ", "                   25\ncorporations  participating  in  the  first  tranche.  Preparing  subprojects  for \nsubsequent tranches will draw upon the models proposed in the first tranche and \nagain provide detailed blueprints for operational restructuring.  \n(v)  Capacity limitations in general corporations may limit absorption, diluting \nimplementation  particularly  for  improving  corporate  governance.  The \ncapacity of the restructuring institutions to assimilate and absorb the changes \nmay be low, especially below senior management. This may constrain the quality \nof operational restructuring. Weak implementation may compromise improved \ninternal governance, particularly by independent directors. To address this, the \nproposed  restructuring  includes  developing  comprehensive  training  programs \nand detailed training on corporate governance and key components of enterprise \noperations. Detailed measures for improved governance have been approved by \nthe boards of management of the general corporations, including criteria for \nindependents directors and the promulgation of a code of ethics for directors and \nother stakeholders. Independent consultants will be recruited under ADF funding \nto facilitate, supervise, and monitor the implementation of agreed measures. \n(vi)  Corporate restructuring requiring share swaps and buybacks may take too \nlong.  Some  of  the  larger  general  corporations  in  particular  have  many \nsubsidiaries, not all of which are fully owned. Realigning all subsidiaries along \nfocused lines of business under sub-holding companies may be slow, particularly \nif consensus is lacking on the relative pricing of shares of subsidiaries and the \nparent company. However, shares of many of the subsidiaries are quite illiquid, \nand the incentive will be strong to swap them for shares of a larger company with \nbetter potential to access capital markets and achieve economies of scale and \nscope. Incentive will be further strengthened as the results of the financial and \noperational restructuring become more evident in general corporation balance \nsheets and performance. A minimum critical mass of corporate restructuring may \nbe enough to trigger and expedite the residual restructuring yet to be done. The \nimplementation horizon of 3 years for corporate restructuring is thus adequate to \nmitigate this risk substantially.  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n79.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  MOF  have  given  the \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n(i)  The Government will undertake a comprehensive review of the existing master \nplan for SOE reform and develop a new plan incorporating lessons from the \nexperience so far.

RECOMMENDATION \n80.  I am satisfied that the proposed multitranche financing facility would comply with the \nArticles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board \napprove the provision of loans under the multitranche financing facility in an aggregate principal \namount not exceeding $630,000,000 equivalent (the facility amount) to the Socialist Republic of \nViet Nam for the SOE Reform and Corporate Governance Facilitation Program comprising: \n \n(i)  loans  in  various  currencies  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $30,000,000  in \nSpecial Drawing Rights from ADB's Special Funds resources, with interest and \nother terms to be determined in accordance with the then-applicable policies \nrelating to Special Funds resources and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  Framework  Financing \nAgreement presented to the Board, subject to the conditions set out in paragraph \n53 of this report; and \n (ii)  loans in an aggregate amount not exceeding the balance of the facility amount \nfrom  ADB's  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  and  other  terms  to  be \ndetermined in accordance with the ADB's London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  Framework  Financing  Agreement \npresented to the Board. \n \n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n6 November 2009 \n ", "                 Appendix 1  27\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORKa \n \n    Data   \nDesign  Performance  Sources/Reporting   \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   Assumptions and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nImproved profitability  Number of general  MOF  Continued commitment to \nand transparency of  corporations and large    transitioning to an \nequitized and  SOEs undergoing    increasingly market-driven \nrestructured SOEs,  operational and financial    economy \nincluding large  restructuring during     \ngeneral corporations  2009\u20132015 increases by    Macroeconomic stability  \nand their subsidiaries   at least 50% over that in     \nprevious 4 years    Economic growth is adequate \n    to absorb growing labor force \nProfitability of  Externally audited   \nrestructured general  annual financial  Sustained successful \ncorporations and SOEs  reports of general  economic performance of \nincreases by 15% over  corporations  equitized SOEs \naverage of 4 years   \npreceding restructuring  Risks \n  Increased resistance from \n  vested interests to SOE \nreform \n \nGovernment uses \ntransformed general \ncorporations for achieving \nnoneconomic objectives, \nincluding using inappropriate \npricing policies. \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \nParticipating general  Debt\u2013equity ratios  NSCERD  The effect of global economic \ncorporations are  reduced by at least 15%    downturn on general \n \ntransformed into  during first 5 years after    corporations is short term. \nfocused, efficient  general corporation     \nbusinesses with  restructuring    Adequate financial resources \nstrong balance      to support continued SOE \nsheets and improved  Cash flows from  Externally audited  restructuring and \ncorporate  operations are enhanced  annual financial  transformation \ngovernance.  by at least 20% during  reports of general   \nfirst 5 years after general  corporations  Continued strengthening of \ncorporation restructuring.    debt-resolution mechanisms \n    and improvements in state \nAt least four general  Externally audited  management of capital \ncorporations converted  annual financial   \ninto pure holding  reports of general  Risk \ncompanies  corporations  Line ministries\u2019 control of \n    general corporations may be \nLines of business of  Externally audited  prolonged due to institutional \ngeneral corporations  annual financial  inadequacy in effective \nreduced  reports of general  management of state capital. \n  corporations \n   \nNumber of principles of  Externally audited \n ", "28   Appendix 1 \n \n    Data   \nDesign  Performance  Sources/Reporting   \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   Assumptions and Risks \ngood corporate  annual financial \ngovernance adopted by  reports of general \ngeneral corporations  corporations \nOutputs       Assumptions \n       \n1.

The general corporations participating in subsequent tranches are expected to undertake \nsimilar inputs and activities for the same outputs. The facility thus provides for a parallel set of activities undertaken \nby participating general corporations but at different times. As a result, the design and monitoring framework for the \nfacility and for each tranche will be the same except for inputs and base values for quantitative indicators. It is for \nthis reason that the performance targets, indicators, activities, and milestones have been specified in terms of \nnumber of months or years from tranche approval.

The state-owned enterprise (SOE) sector in Viet Nam has historically been an important \ncomponent of the economy. In 1991, Viet Nam had 12,300 SOEs with total capitalization of \nD34,000  billion.  Following  a  Government  decree  to  reregister  or  close  SOEs  based  on \ncommercial viability, their number dropped to 6,300 through liquidations and mergers, though \ntotal capitalization increased to D53,000 billion. Most liquidated and merged SOEs were small, \nlocally managed enterprises with fewer than 100 employees. Following government instructions \nin 1994, another round of mergers and liquidations reduced the number of SOEs to 5,500 by the \nend of 1997. Many of the over 1 million retrenched SOE workers were employed in private \nbusinesses. The SOE sector was highly concentrated, with the largest 200 SOEs accounting for \nnearly 60% of state capital and 40% of total debt. \n \n2.  Drastic reduction in trade and financial flows from the former Soviet Union and its \nassociated  economies  prompted  government  policies  towards  commercializing  SOEs. \nEnterprises were allowed to formulate their own operating plans and shift to market-based \nrelationships with suppliers and customers through the introduction of economic contracts as \nthe bases for transactions among enterprises. However, SOE profitability has been low. An \nassessment by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) in the late 1990s found that only 40% were \nprofitable in terms of reporting profit over the past 3 years and paying all wages and taxes. \n \n3.  Today there are 6,500 SOEs reporting to more than a 100 line authorities, including \nmore than 60 provincial people\u2019s committees, 23 ministries and ministerial-level authorities, and \nthe Prime Minister's office. The SOE sector continues to play a significant role despite a decline \nin its relative size in recent years. According to the General Statistical Office of the Government, \nthe share of the state-owned (enterprise) sector in the gross domestic product has shown a \nmodest decline but remains near 40%, while the share of the sector in industrial output has \ndeclined more, from above 40% in 2000 to less than 30% in 2007 (Figure A2.1).1 SOEs and \nconglomerates  are  estimated  to  account  for  60%  of  outstanding  loans  from  domestic \ncommercial banks. \n \n  Figure A2.1: Share of State-Owned Sector 2000-07\n \n \n  41.5 45.0\n  41.0 40.0\n  35.0\n40.5\n  30.0\n40.0 y\n  DP 25.0 str\n  % G 39.5 20.0 ndu\n  39.0 15.0 % I\n  38.5\n10.0\n  38.0 5.0\n \n37.5 0.0\n  00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07\n \nGDP Industrial Output\n \n     GDP = gross domestic product. \n     Source: Asian Development Bank. \n                                                 \n1 The figures are supposed to be adjusted for equitization of SOEs, but need to be interpreted cautiously since the \nmethodology is not clear.  The data can be viewed as providing trends and orders of magnitude for state-owned \nenterprise sector in the economy. \n ", "32   Appendix 2 \n \n \n4.  Long period of reforms. SOE equitization\u2014the process of converting SOEs into joint \nstock companies with limited liability\u2014was launched in mid-1992, but by the end of 1997 only \n17 enterprises had been equitized. In 1998, following a review of the SOE reform program, \nseveral new initiatives were undertaken, including (i) Prime Minister Circular 20/1998/CT-TTg, \nwhich sets out the main policies to guide the restructuring of enterprises, including a framework \nfor classifying SOEs in terms of plans for diversified ownership; (ii) Decree No. 44/1998/ND/CP, \nwhich clarifies and simplifies the equitization process; (iii) the setting up of a national enterprise \nreform  committee  as  a  national  organization  to  approach  SOE  reforms;  and  (iv)  the \nannouncement  of  equitization  targets  to  2000,  including  the  complete  divestiture  of  small \nenterprises with capital of less than D1 billion.  \n \n5.  The 3rd Central Party Resolution in September 2001 on \"continuous rearrangement, \nreform, development, and improvement of efficiency of SOEs\" set the following tasks for the 5 \nyear  period  2001\u20132005:  (i)  complete  the  basic  restructuring  and  structural  adjustments  of \nexisting SOEs; (ii) equitize SOEs in which the state did not intend to keep 100% ownership; (iii) \ndissolve or place into bankruptcy inefficient SOEs; and (iv) transfer, sell outright, or lease small \nSOEs that could not be equitized and in which the state did not seek to retain control. \n \n6.  In  2002,  the  Government  ordered  all  line  authorities,  including  provincial  people\u2019s \ncommittees, line ministries, and ministerial-level authorities, to submit a comprehensive plan to \nrearrange and develop the SOEs under their management for the period 2002\u20132005. These \nplans, approved between October 2002 and November 2003, listed for each line authority the \nSOEs  to  be  retained  as  100%  SOE  administrative  revenue-generating  units,  merged  or \nconverted into holding companies, or divested by equitization, assignment, sale, management \ncontract, leasing, conversion into one-member limited-liability companies, or liquidation and \nbankruptcy, specifying the method and year of implementation. In 2004, the Government issued \nDecision 155, which presented new criteria for classifying SOEs and their equitization that \nrequired updating all line-authority plans. As of mid-2006, the Government had approved only \n15 of the updated plans.  \n \n7.  In subsequent years, the Government has continuously refined and revised regulations \non SOE transformation. The current legal framework of SOE reform comprises (i) the Law on \nState-Owned Enterprises, Enterprise Law, and Law on Securities; (ii) decrees, circulars, and \ninstructions  on  the  equitization  process;  (iii)  decrees,  circulars,  and  instructions  on \ntransformation through sales, assignments, business contracts, and management contracts; (iv) \ndecrees,  circulars,  and  instructions  on  the  conversion  process  applicable  to  the  parent \ncompany\u2013subsidiary  model;  and  (v)  decrees,  circulars,  and  instructions  on  the  financial \nmanagement  and  monitoring  of  SOEs.  SOE  reform is  monitored  by  the  National  Steering \nCommittee for Enterprise Reform and Development (NSCERD), which is chaired by the Prime \nMinister in coordination with MOF. \n \n8.  The process of equitization, which initially took 3 years and was reduced to 13 months \nby 2006, now takes 9 months following the issuance of Decree 109 in 2007. \n \n9.  Slow progress. Progress in equitizing SOEs has been slow. Detailed data on the SOE \nsector are generally not easily available. Until 2006, a donor-assisted project accumulated \ndetailed data at NSCERD showing that, out of 6,459 SOEs, 5,466 were identified for conversion \nand 993 SOEs were to be retained as 100% state owned (Table A2.1). Out of the 5,466 SOEs, \nconversion of 3,201 SOEs (58.6%) was completed, of which 2,356 SOEs had been equitized. \nOnly a few of the equitized SOEs were listed.  \n ", "                 Appendix 2  33\n \n \nFigure A2.2: Equitization Process \n \n \nDDaayy  11 DDaayy  1155 DDaayy  8855 DDaayy  111100 DDaayy  223300 DDaayy  227700\nEEqquuiittiizzaattiioonn   PPrreeppaarree   AApppprroovvee    AApppprroovvee   FFiirrsstt   LLiicceennssee  \n  ddeecciissiioonn ddooccuummeennttaattiioonn vvaalluuaattiioonn  rreeppoorrtt eeqquuiittiizzaattiioonn  ppllaann GGSSMM JJSSCC\n \n \n \n11 55 1155 7755 8855 110055 111100 220000 223300 227700\n \n \nSSeett  uupp   SSeett  uupp   SSOOEE   CCoommpplleettee   CCoommpplleettee   FFiinnaalliizzee  \n \nSSOOEERRCC AAssssiissttaanntt   VVaalluuaattiioonn eeqquuiittiizzaattiioonn  ppllaann sshhaarree  ssaallee eeqquuiittiizzaattiioonn\n  TTeeaamm\n \nGSM = general shareholders meeting,  JSC = joint stock company, SOERC = state-owned enterprise reform \ncommittee. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \nTable A2.1: Number of State-Owned Enterprise Conversions by Line Authority,  \n2001\u2013mid-2006 \n \n  Number of State Owned Enterprises, by Line Authority \nYear  Line  People's \nGC91  Ministry  Committee  Total \n2001  11  27  244  282 \n2002  53  57  268  378 \n2003  40  152  424  616 \n2004  80  225  509  814 \n2005  116  254  500  870 \n2006 (June)  32  93  116  241 \n  Total  332  808  2,061  3,201 \nGC91 = general corporation or conglomerate reporting to the Prime Minister. \nSource: National Steering Committee for Enterprise Reform and Development database, cited in ADB. \n \n2006.

The  pre-2007  database  provides  information  on  several  attributes  of  early  SOE \nequitization. Most of the SOEs equitized were small; 46% had charter capital of less than D5 \nbillion, though the size increased marginally over time. The average number of employees in the \nequitized SOEs was 260, or an estimated 36% of total employees in the SOE sector prior to the \nstart of restructuring. SOEs equitized by mid-2006 accounted for only a third of SOE bank debt \nat the time. Very few outsiders such as strategic investors were involved in the process. \n \n11.  Early equitization was primarily internal, with employees of the SOEs acquiring far more \nthan half the shares in the equitized SOE. The government and employees together held almost \n80% of the shares until 2005. Over time, the stake of employees declined modestly while that of \ncompany outsiders increased. This reflected the introduction of Decree 187 in 2004, which \nrequired equitized SOEs to auction shares to the public rather than sell them on the company\u2019s \npremises.  \n \n12.  The proportion of SOEs in which the state retained more than 50% of the charter capital \nincreased. Further, the larger the charter capital, the more the state capital exceeded 50%. \n ", "34   Appendix 2 \n \nHigher state stakes in equitized SOEs reflects the larger size of SOEs equitized later in the \nequitization process. Higher state share may also stem from these SOEs achieving relatively \nlow profitability and thus finding it hard to attract external investors. Their shares were often \nundersubscribed  in  auctions,  and  the  state could  not  sell  as  many  shares  as  it  intended. \nEquitized SOEs with state shareholding of more than 50% are still considered SOEs because \nthe state retains controlling power. \n \n13.  According to the latest data provided by MOF, as of 31 December 2007, 4,979 SOEs \nhad been restructured and 3,369 SOEs had been equitized. For the period 2008\u20132010, the \nGovernment has plans to convert an additional 1,535 SOEs, of which 948 are proposed for \nequitization (Table A2.2).2  \n \nTable A2.2: Planned State-Owned Enterprise Conversions, 2007\u20132010 \n \nItem  SOEs to be converted  Of which equitized \nCumulative to 31 Dec 2007  4,979  3,369 \nPlanned 2008\u20132010  1.535  948 \nFirst 6 months of 2008  61  30 \nSOE = state-owned enterprise. \nSources: Ministry of Finance, Government of Viet Nam, 2008; and ADB. 2006.

General corporations. In 1995, the Government organized many SOEs into 17 general \ncorporations or conglomerates and 77 special general corporations. The 17 conglomerates \nreport to the Prime  Minister and are often referred to as GC91s. The 77 special general \ncorporations  report  to  line  ministries  or  peoples  committees  and  are  often  referred  to  as \nGC90s.3 In 2005, the Government initiated the conversion of general corporations into holding \ncompanies with a directive from the Prime Minister (33/2005/CT-TTg, dated 13 October 2005) \non effectively applying the parent\u2013subsidiary company model on a pilot basis.4 \n \n15.  Under  Decree  111,5 a  parent  company  can  be  one  of  the  following:  (i)  a  general \ncorporation, independent member SOE within a general corporation, or independent SOE under \na line authority operating under the Law on State Enterprises; (ii) a state-owned single-member \nlimited company operating under the Law on Enterprises; or (iii) a joint stock company operating \nunder the Law on Enterprises. Subsidiaries of a parent company operate under the Law on \nEnterprises. The prerequisites for reorganizing or converting a general corporation into a parent \n                                                 \n2  The most recent MOF estimates for the number of SOEs to be converted differ by 55 from the earlier estimates \nprovided by the donor-assisted project in NSCERD. In addition to underlining the lack of data transparency, this \nreflects the creation of new SOEs and that some SOEs not considered for transformation went into the equitization \nprocess. \n3 In 2002, these 94 general corporations included 1,605 member SOEs, representing 28% of all SOEs and 65% of \nthe capital of all SOEs. \n4 The Government has allowed a few general corporations in critical industries to reform themselves into economic \ngroups. An economic group is a group of companies with independent legal status formed by associating through \ninvestment, capital contribution, merger, buyout or reorganization, or other forms of association; with long-term \nattachments in terms of economic interests, technology, markets, and other business services; and forming a \nbusiness complex with two or more levels of enterprises in the form of parent company\u2013subsidiaries. An economic \ngroup has no separate legal status. (Art 26 Decree 139/2007/ND-CP.) \n5 The legal framework for conversions of general corporations and SOEs into the parent company model consists of \n(i) Decree 111/2007/ND-CP, on the conversion of SOEs on the parent company\u2013subsidiaries model; (ii) Circular \n03/2005/TT-BKH, dated 18 July 2005, on the content and the procedures for developing the charter of a parent \ncompany; and (iii) Circular 72/2005/TT-BTC, dated 1 September 2005, which guides the preparation of financial \nmanagement regulations for a state parent company. \n ", "                 Appendix 2  35\ncompany are that (i) all member companies under it have a plan to convert into joint stock or \nsingle-member limited-liability companies and that the general corporation itself be eligible to be \nconverted into a single-member limited-liability company; (ii) the general corporation has charter \ncapital of not less than D500 billion; and (iii) the general corporation has the financial capacity, \nknow-how, brand name, market to invest in other companies, as well as the capacity to operate \nmultiple businesses around one core activity. \n \n16.  Little success with general corporation equitization. The SOEs that have yet to be \ntransformed are mainly the GC90s and GC91s and their subsidiaries. In December 2006, the \nPrime Minister approved Decision 1729/QD-TTg, a master plan that includes a list of general \ncorporations identified for equitization: 1 economic group, 7 GC91s, 52 general corporations \nunder the supervision of line ministries, 1 general corporation under the supervision of MOF, 5 \ngeneral corporations under the supervision of the State Bank of Vietnam, 5 general corporations \nunder the supervision of Hanoi provincial people's committee, and 7 general corporations under \nthe supervision of the Ho Chi Minh City people\u2019s committee. The plan was for about 20 general \ncorporations to be equitized every year from 2007\u20132010. As of 31 May 2008, none of the \nGC91s and only 7 GC90s had been equitized.6 \n \n1.  Constraints on Equitizing General Corporations  \n17.  Difficulties in valuation. Valuating general corporations is complicated by the need to \nvalue  their  share  holdings  in  subsidiaries  that  may  be  engaged  in  a  wide  spectrum  of \nbusinesses  and  may  be  equitized  and  listed.  The  boards  of  management  of  equitized \nsubsidiaries are generally quite autonomous and distinct from that of the general corporation, \nand the equitized subsidiaries are typically allowed to make business decisions themselves. \nHence, it is difficult for others, such as strategic investors, to properly evaluate the extent of \ninfluence the general corporation has on the management of subsidiaries. \n \n18.  General corporations and large SOEs often face difficulties in documenting such details \nas design capacity, years of use, year of manufacture, etc., for machinery and equipment, much \nof which is obsolete and out of production. Valuating the land holdings of general corporations \nhas also proved difficult. This creates difficulties in obtaining price quotations for enterprise \n \nassets as required by regulations. \n \n19.  Cumbersome size. The large scale and complexity of operations means management \nin many general corporations has limitations in terms of the skills and capacity to undertake the \nneeded strategic and rational restructuring. In addition, the total value of some of the general \ncorporations  and  their  subsidiaries  may  be  too  great  to  allow  others,  including  staff  and \nmanagement and even many outside strategic investors, to acquire a meaningful holding during \nequitization. \n \n20.  Financial constraints. A major constraint on transforming many general corporations \nhas been their financial weakness. General corporations have relied on extensive borrowing \n                                                 \n6  The seven equitized GC90s were Viet Nam Electronics and Informatics Corporation (VEIC) under the Ministry of \nTrade and Industry and Vinaconex under the Ministry of Construction in 2006; the Trading and Construction \nCorporation under the Ministry of Transportation, Bao Viet under MOF, Vietcom Bank under the State Bank of \nVietnam, and Sabeco under the Ministry of Industry in 2007; and Habeco under the Ministry of Industry in 2008. In \naddition, nine general corporations were divested as follows. Six general corporations were liquidated: Vinaplast, \nLeaprodexim, Viglaceglass, Machinoimport, and VietGoldGem; one general corporation was restructured: Vietnam \nNational Alcohol\u2013Beer\u2013Soft Drink Corporation; and two general corporations were merged: Vietnam National Gem \nand Gold Corporation and Vietnam National Minerals Corporation. \n ", "36   Appendix 2 \n \nfrom  the  Government  and  state-owned  commercial  banks  to  finance  their  operations,  with \nvirtually no access to capital markets. Most of the large SOEs and general corporations have \nvery high debt, and debt-to-equity ratios are frequently far in excess of 100%. This has severely \nconstrained  their  ability  to  service  their  debt  and  contributed  to  the  high  numbers  of \nnonperforming  loans  in  the  banking  system.  High  indebtedness  implies  that  general \ncorporations are ill-equipped to deal with risks and will not have the financial capacity to fund \ncapital investments. The problem is exacerbated by much of their debt being high cost and short \nterm. \n \n21.  Other factors that contributed to the slow pace of equitization, particularly in the earlier \nphases, were as follows: (i) Some SOEs were reluctant to be equitized because they would lose \nstate support and privileges. (ii) Equitization procedures were complex and required a profound \nknowledge of them that many SOEs were not prepared to acquire. (iii) Selling shares through \noutside intermediary financial institutions and by auction was new and it took time for the \nprocesses to become streamlined. \n \n22.  Weak corporate governance. Poor corporate governance has constrained equitization. \nA survey of 400 companies conducted by the Central Institute of Economic Management in \n2002 revealed that only 26% of those surveyed believed most business people in Viet Nam \nunderstood  the  basic  concepts  and  principles  of  corporate  governance.  Promoting  sound \ncorporate governance of equitized SOEs is key to the ultimate success of the equitization \nprogram in Viet Nam. At present, the appointment of members of the board of management \n(BOM), its chair, and the general director is determined by the authorized state body. This \ncreates  difficulties  in  allocating  duties  and  responsibilities  and  the  related  authority  over \noperational matters between the chair, BOM, and general director, as well as accountability for \ntheir actions. The BOM and the board of directors are often uncertain over the strategic direction \nof the holding company and their operational relationships with fellow subsidiaries and affiliates, \nor how to create an effective grouping that will grow sustainably. \n \n23.  Weak  framework  for  resolving  nonperforming  debts  and  assets.  The  lack  of \neffective  resolution  of  nonperforming  debts  has  brought  stalemate  and  prolonging  of  the \nremaining SOE divestitures. In February 2003, the Korean Asset Management Corporation was \nengaged by the United Nations Development Programme to do a feasibility study in Viet Nam to \ncreate the centralized Debt and Asset Trading Corporation (DATC). Based in part on that study, \nthe Prime Minister issued Decision #109, dated 5 June 2003, creating DATC in MOF to expedite \ncorporate restructuring. DATC was created with the Government pledging D2,000 billion from \nthe state budget in total capital, with D500 billion initially allocated in 2004. The three objectives \nof DATC are to acquire and resolve nonperforming loans and uncollectible receivables owned \nby SOEs, deal in and resolve interests received from SOEs upon equitization, and provide \nconsulting services to SOEs for resolving their nonperforming loans.  \n \n24.  The recovery ratios of received debts to date are relatively low, accounting for only 10% \nof total book value.7 Decree #69 contains provisions stating that the purchase and sale of \nnonperforming loans and uncollectible receivables are to be made at market prices through \nnegotiation or auction bidding, or at the price stated by the relevant authority. Currently, DATC \nis able to obtain outstanding assets only at prices determined by an external auditing and \nvaluation firm and approved by MOF. \n \n                                                 \n7  Among 19,526 items of nonperforming assets, 14,764 items with total book value of D659 billion are considered \nirrecoverable (DATC. 2007. Operational Report.  Ha Noi. \n ", "                 Appendix 2  37\n25.  Going  forward,  it  will  be  necessary  to  consider  the  legal  mechanisms,  processes, \npowers, and financial resources of DATC. Upon acquiring debts, DATC currently stays on as a \ncreditor to the company. Given the size of the debt relative to the legal capital of the debtor \ncompanies and that ownership remains with line ministries or agencies, DATC is unable to \nimpose any changes to enhance or rehabilitate debtor companies. SOEs are largely unwilling to \nwork  with  DATC  to  resolve  debts  because  of  perceptions  that  involvement  with  DATC \nconsumes lots of resources and time. \n \n26.  Reforms are needed to limit the layers of authority controlling land, the most popular \ncollateral asset in Viet Nam. There is no specific provision on the transfer or assignment of \nmortgages in the civil code, the Ordinance on Economic Contracts, or commercial law. This \nconstrains trading in any secondary market for distressed assets since investors, especially \nforeign investors, are discouraged by the uncertainty of transfer or assignment of mortgages. \n \n27.  To effectively play its role in enhancing the debt-resolution mechanism, DATC needs to \nimprove its management processes, including developing its human resources and enhancing  \nits  information  system.  The  current  organization  lacks  important  departments  such  as  for \ninternal audit, investment, public relations, or corporate restructuring. DATC needs to review its \nfinancial capacity relative to the size of nonperforming loans and to outsource or otherwise \nobtain necessary industry-specific expertise to devise workouts. \n \n28.  Enhancing management of state capital. In 2005, the Government established the \nState Capital Investment Corporation (SCIC) to manage state investments in enterprises and to \ninvest and trade in state capital. The primary objectives of SCIC are to accelerate and enhance \nthe effectiveness of SOE reform and to improve the efficiency of the utilization of state capital. \nSCIC commenced operations in August 2006 and, by December 2007, managed an investment \nportfolio comprising 829 enterprises with a total book value of D7,710 billion. Three quarters of \nthese  enterprises  are  very  small,  with  legal  capital  of  less  than  D10  billion,  and  operate \nineffectively. SCIC plans to divest state capital from more than 700 of these equitized SOEs. An \noptimal  solution  would  be  to  enhance  their  value  through  restructuring  before  divestment. \nHowever, such restructuring is difficult to implement, as SCIC is only one shareholder in these \nSOEs. \n \n \n29.  The effectiveness of SCIC has been limited by the lack of explicit criteria for handing \nover state interests in large enterprises and general corporations, which is done on a case-by-\ncase basis by the Prime Minister's office (many of the general corporations are much larger than \nSCIC) and the potential for conflict between SCIC and line ministries. Moreover, line ministries \nreserve the right to retain their interest in general corporations after initial public offerings. Line \nministries may agree to ownership of the state interest in equitized SOEs being registered under \nSCIC, but the ministries reserve the right to appoint key people to boards of management. A \nfurther constraint is the inadequate regulatory framework for financial management in SCIC. \nThe current regulations (Decree #199, Circular #33, and Circular #87) allow SCIC to sell state \nstakes only by auction. Divestments can be made more quickly if sales agreed through direct \nnegotiations between buyers and sellers are also allowed. Under the prevailing regulations, the \nsame set of valuation rules, especially the rules that concern land-use rights, must be used pre \nand post equitization. These rules impede the ability to unlock the potential worth of the SOE. \nCurrent securities law restricts SCIC\u2019s stock transactions, as SCIC cannot sell state interest at \nhigher than the mandated trading band. Other constraints are the lack of a clear strategy and \nrole for SCIC or of training and inadequate institutional capacity in SCIC to manage investments \nand improve governance in equitized SOEs. \n \n ", "38   Appendix 2 \n \n30.  SCIC must improve management processes and corporate governance, in both SCIC \nand the investee companies it manages. SCIC\u2019s interests in equitized SOEs are managed \nthrough representations in the BOM of the SOE. However, there is a need to provide formal \ntraining to its representatives to be effective. Also, corporate governance standards in SOEs, \nsuch as on reporting guidelines, need enhancement. SCIC does not have formal investment \nguidelines to help manage investments or a knowledge database. Portfolio management is \ncurrently based on the book value, though market value may be more relevant. SCIC is working \nwith  consultants  to  develop  its  information  and  communication  technology  system  and \noperational  manuals.  However,  substantial  management  restructuring  and  operational \nstrengthening  is  needed  to  improve  its  effectiveness  and  promote  enhanced  corporate \ngovernance, including in the SOEs managed by SCIC. \n ", "  Appendix 3  39  \nDEVELOPMENT COORDINATION \n \n         \nPurpose (Implementing Agency)  Donor or Provider  Amount  Status  Start Date \nState-owned enterprise \nPPTA for SOE Reform and Corporate Governance  ADB     Ongoing  2007 \nFacilitation \nStudy on investment management of economic groups  World Bank  $25,000   Completed  2008 \n(CIEM) \nAcceleration of equitization and restructuring SOEs in  ASEM 5 European (World  $1,470,000 +  Completed  2003 \nthe line ministries of industry, agriculture, and  Bank administered)  $400,000 \nconstruction) and in two provinces \nSupport to capacity building in NSCERD in the SOE  DANIDA  $1,700,000  Completed  2001\u2013\nreform process (NSCERD)  2004 \nPilot restructuring of three general corporations:   DFID (UK)  \u00a31,800,000  Completed  2004 \nVinatex, Vinacafe, and Seaprodex (NSCERD) \nDak Lak pilot project to equitize and divest 51 SOEs  IFC administered /DANIDA  $410,000  Ongoing    \nthrough auctions \nStudy on economic group (CIEM)  AusAID  $70,000   Completed  2004 \nSupport auditing of 100 major SOEs    World Bank, DANIDA, EU  $8 million  Completed  2001\u2013\n(administered by World Bank)  2005 \nSupport to labor made redundant after SOE  World Bank  Phase 1,  Completed  2002\u2013\nrestructuring (MOF)  $300,000  2005 \n(2002\u20132004); \nphase 2, \n$200,000 \n(2005) \nState-owned commercial banks \nMekong Housing Bank    AFD      Ongoing  2006 \n1.

Selection of General Corporations \n1.  The basic principles guiding the selection of general corporations for participation in the \nState-Owned Enterprise Reform and Corporate Governance Facilitation Program (SRCGFP) \nare (i) commitment and willingness to reform on the part of the general corporations themselves, \ntheir line ministries or agencies concerned, and the Government of Viet Nam (the Government); \n(ii) relevance of the general corporations to the country strategy and sector strategy of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) and to the Government's plans and strategy for the state-owned \nenterprise  (SOE)  sector;  and  (iii)  the  financial  viability  of  the  general  corporations  after \nrestructuring under the SRCGFP, including potential for listing. These selection criteria may be \nreviewed and agreed upon between ADB and the Government, as needed. \n \n2.  Commitment to reform. The core elements of the SRCGFP are financial restructuring, \ncorporate  restructuring,  and  operational  or  management  restructuring.  While  financial \nrestructuring would always be useful to any enterprise if it enabled strengthening the balance \nsheet,  both  corporate  and  particularly  operational  restructuring  are  complex  and  intangible \nchanges that depend for their success as much on changing mindsets as physical changes. The \nutility  and  success  of  these  restructuring  measures  thus critically  depends  on  an  intrinsic, \nstrong, and evident commitment to the envisaged changes.  \n \n3.  Prior to participating in the SRCGFP, general corporations will need to undertake several \nmeasures: \n(i)  Express general interest in participating in the facility to Ministry of Finance (MOF) \nand the Ministry of Planning and Investment. \n(ii)  Undertake a comprehensive review of their financial and operational parameters, \nfocusing on assessing and identifying core business areas; crystallizing strategic \ngoals and objectives; analyzing strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats in \ncore business areas; and developing a plan of proposed measures to strengthen \ncorporate balance sheets and business processes to enhance their value to strategic \nand other investors, including through equitization or eventual listing. \n(iii)  Based on internal and external consultations, finalize restructuring plans and obtain \nfirm commitment from the board of management and line ministry or agency for their \napproval of the proposed restructuring.  \n(iv)  Review existing processes for corporate governance, identify gaps, and develop \ncomprehensive plans to restructure operations as necessary to strengthen corporate \ngovernance. \n(v)  Include all senior and middle management in consultations to generate broad buy-in \nand  enhance  the  implementation  of  the  envisaged  restructuring  and  changes, \nincluding for strengthening corporate governance. \n(vi)  Make  transparent  and  available  all  data  necessary  for  analyzing  financial  and \noperational  performance,  including  plans  and  projections  for  investments  in  the \nmedium term. \n(vii)  Obtain endorsement from MOF for their participation. \n \n4.  Strategic relevance. The selection of general corporations will focus on sectors that are \nrelevant to ADB's country operations as laid out in the country partnership strategy1. General \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2006. Viet Nam: Country Strategy and Program (2007\u20132010). Manila (September). \n ", "  Appendix 5  43  \ncorporation selection will have to be consistent with ADB's strategy for reforming the SOE \nsector, as well as that of the Government. The Government is developing its plans for the \nequitization of remaining SOEs and will prepare a new, longer-term plan for development to \nfollow the Socio-Economic Development Plan 2006\u20132010.  \n \n5.  Financial  viability. The end result of any general corporation\u2019s participation in the \nSRCGFP is the unlocking of the full potential value of its assets through transformation into a \nglobally competitive, efficient, and profitable enterprise with good corporate governance. This \nwill maximize returns to the Government when the enterprise is listed on the exchange. The \nfinancial and operational viability of the enterprise is thus a prerequisite for participation in the \nfacility. While it is possible that the general corporation may not necessarily be highly profitable \nprior to restructuring, it has to be structurally transformable into a profitable entity. The general \ncorporation should thus be in a position to meaningfully benefit from ADB debt and operational \nrestructuring to become profitable and able to maximize value for shareholders and access \ncapital markets. The financial and operational analysis undertaken prior to participation in the \nfacility will be used to assess the viability of the enterprise's operations. This will include the \nelimination or divestiture of areas of operation that would otherwise preclude the enterprise\u2019s \nbeing financial viable. Similarly, general corporations in areas where financial viability has lower \nemphasis, such as national defense, may not be appropriate for participation in the facility.  \n \nB.  Approval Procedures \n6.  The  participation  of  general  corporations  in  subsequent  tranches  will  follow  the \nprocedures  outlined  below.  Initial  consultations  will  be  held  between  MOF  and  general \ncorporations  interested  in  participating.  Based  on  the  consultations  and  consistency  with \nGovernment plans and strategy, MOF will indicate to ADB the general corporations that can \npotentially participate. Subject to ADB's endorsement of potential participation, the identified \ngeneral corporations will need to fulfill the criteria for selection listed above. A comprehensive \nanalysis of the general corporations\u2019 financial and operations parameters will be undertaken, as \nwell as an assessment of their strengths and weaknesses in core business areas. The general \ncorporations will develop a plan of proposed measures to strengthen their corporate balance \nsheets and business processes to enhance their value to strategic and other investors, including \n \nthrough equitization or eventual listing. Core areas of weaknesses and challenges in corporate \ngovernance  will  be  identified  and  measures  proposed  for  mitigating  them.  For  general \ncorporations  without  adequate  informational  infrastructure  or  expertise  to  carry  out  these \npreparations, ADB will, at the Government\u2019s request, provide technical assistance to the general \ncorporations for undertaking such analyses and preparing plans. The plans and restructuring \nmeasures thus identified will then be presented to the middle and senior management of the \ngeneral corporations, followed by presentation for endorsement to the board of management \nand the line ministry or agency concerned. The general corporation board of management will \nprovide  a  formal  letter  to  MOF  endorsing  the  implementation  of  the  proposed  plans  and \nrestructuring measures and the participation of the general corporation in the facility. In addition, \nthe general corporation will provide in a transparent and comprehensive manner all relevant \nfinancial information to MOF and ADB to allow appropriate due diligence and the identification of \nissues, if any, related to ADB's social and environment safeguards.  \n \n7.  Based on the information prepared by the general corporations, with possible facilitation \nby ADB consultants, the projects will be appraised by ADB and MOF, which will provide a \nsovereign  guarantee  for  the  ADB  lending.  After  ADB's  approval,  and  subject  to  any \nmodifications and measures required by ADB, MOF will prepare periodic financing requests \n(PFRs)  for  ADB  financing.  Each  PFR  will  provide  (i)  the  loan  amount  required;  (ii)  the \n ", " 4 4  Appendix 5 \n \nsubprojects and components to be finance under the loan; (iii) cost estimates and a financing \nplan; (iv) implementation arrangements; (v) confirmation of continuing validity of and adherence \nto the provisions of the framework financing agreement; (vi) confirmation of compliance with the \nprovisions  under  previous  loan  and  project  agreements,  as  appropriate;  and  (vii)  other \ninformation required under the facility administration memorandum to be prepared and agreed \nby ADB and the Government, to facilitate the processing and implementation of the facility. The \nGovernment will formally submit the PFRs to ADB for further processing. \n \n8.  In addition to general corporations, the Government may request the participation of \nother  institutions,  such  as  those  dealing  with  resolving  distressed  assets  and  debts  and \nmanaging the state's capital in SOEs. These roles are currently performed by the Debt and \nAsset Trading Company, which is participating in the first trance of the facility, and the State \nCapital Investment Corporation. The Government is reviewing the roles of these institutions, \nparticularly the State Capital Investment Corporation, and will improve either or both institutions, \nas well as consider alternative institutions. If the Government deems it appropriate to seek \nfurther support for such institutions under the facility, MOF will consult with ADB to identify the \nscope and amount of support sought. Upon agreement between ADB and the Government, \nMOF will prepare a PFR that may be combined with financing support for general corporations \nas described above.  \n ", "               Appendix 6  45 \nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND PROJECTIONS OF SONG DA GENERAL \nCORPORATION \n \nA.  Introduction \n1.  Song Da was established under Decision No. 996/BXD\u2013TCLD, dated 15 November \n1995,  as  a  GC90,  or  a  general  corporation  under  the  direct  authority  of  the  Ministry  of \nConstruction.  The  general  corporation  established  a  parent  company,  using  the  subsidiary \nmodel according to Decision 2435/QD\u2013BXD of the Ministry of Construction, dated 30 December \n2005.  It  has  equitized  all  of  its  state-owned  enterprises  except  the  dependent  accounting \nmembers, the Deo Ngang Company and Song Da Vocational School. According to the master \nplan outlined in Prime Minister Decision No. 1729/QD-TTg, dated 29 December 2006, Song Da \nis scheduled to be equitized in 2010. The decision of the Ministry of Construction has not yet \nbeen issued.  \n \n2.  The main activities of Song Da are hydropower plant construction, heavy industrial \nmanufacturing, and electricity generation and trading. It operates in all provinces in the country. \nIn addition, it provides trading, consulting, and insurance services. It had 21,665 employees as \nof 31 December 2007 and total assets of D21,922 billion. \n \n3.  Many practices and processes that would be expected in large enterprises in other \ncountries with comparable income per capital are not found in businesses in Viet Nam. There \nare considerable gaps in the data available on the operations of the general corporations that \nreflect the structural constraints of an economy in transition from central planning to a market-\nbased system and accounting and auditing standards and practices still developing. Audited \naccounts of all the general corporations have comments and/or caveats. There is no information \non transactions between companies within groups. There are no market projections. Investment \nfeasibility studies lack adequate data analysis, and most general corporations do not have cash \nflow projections. Attempts have been made to address the data gaps to the extent possible, but \nthe analysis below remains constrained by the structural constraints on data availability. \n \nB.  Historical Performance \n \n4.  The auditors\u2019 report on the consolidated financial statements of Song Da to 2007 have \nbeen qualified in respect of the non-elimination of intra-group sales and purchases, the related \nreceivables and payables from them, and unearned profits on inventories and work in progress. \nThis  affects  accuracy  of  group  sales  and  cost-of-sales  amounts.  The  non-elimination  of \nunearned profits captured in inventories and work in progress results in overstatement of past \nprofits of the group to the same extent.  \n \n5.  The income statements of Song Da showed continuous improvement in gross profit from \n2005 to 2007 (Figure A6.1). The profit margin increased from 6% in 2005 to 10% in 2007, and \nsales generated from operations were able to cover operating expenses. Financial expenses \n(mostly interest costs), equaled 5.5% of net sales in 2005, and 7.4% in 2007, showing the \nconsiderable impact of interest costs on the profitability of the general corporation. \n \n6.  Four  main  subgroups\u2014hydropower  construction;  electricity  generation  and  trading; \nindustrial production; and the construction of underground systems, buildings, and bridges\u2014\ncontribute 73% of Song Da\u2019s turnover and 85% of its profit. The contribution from the parent \ncompany is 23% of turnover and 11% of profit. The remaining 4% of turnover and 4% of profit is \nfrom other non-core activities. The subgroup constructing underground systems, buildings, and \n ", " 4 6  Appendix 6 \nbridges alone contributed 8% of Song Da\u2019s turnover but 38% of its profits, showing that it has \npromise for future development. \n \n  Figure A6.1: Song Da's Income Statement, 2005\u20132007 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCOGS = cost of goods sold. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.   \n \n7.

From 2005 to 2007, return on equity of Song Da declined from 24.95% to 18.52%, \nattributed to the decline in asset turnover from 0.88 in 2005 to 0.46 in 2007. The return on equity \nand other ratios for the past 3 years are shown in Table A6.1. \n \nTable A6.1: Some Performance Indicators for Song Da \nRatio  2005  2006  2007 \nReturn on equity (%)  24.95  18.35  18.52 \nProfit margin (%)  6.20  6.80  9.80 \nAsset turnover (times)  0.88  0.53  0.46 \nAsset/Equity (times)  4.54  5.13  4.12 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n9.  The decrease in return on equity (ROE) is not attributed to falling profitability but rather \nto lower asset turnover. According to the management of Song Da, the lower ROE was due \nmainly to the group's many current investments, some of which have yet to contribute any \nreturn.  These  projects  will  be  significant  contributors  to  future  performance.  Figure  A6.3 \nindicates the difference in ROE among activities. The ROE for industrial production is only \n6.72%, two thirds the ROE from electricity, at 9.66%. These two segments require higher \ninfrastructure investments, with many ongoing projects, but generate relatively low sales. \n \n \n \nFigure A6.3: Return on Investments  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n   \n   \n  Source: Asian Development Bankestimates.\n \n \n10.  To meet the continuing need of the Government to increase hydroelectric generation \ncapacity to satisfy fast-growing demand for electricity, Song Da has been constructing and \noperating  more  hydropower  plants  under  build\u2013operate\u2013transfer  terms.  Hence,  cash  flow \ngenerated from operations is inadequate to finance capital funding. Song Da will continue to rely \non bank support to refinance maturing loans and provide new loans. This trend will continue \nuntil the cash flows generated from operations surpass further capital funding needs. In this \nregard, the ordinary capital resources (OCR) loan from the Asian Development Bank to help \nrestructure the  outstanding  loans to  the  group  will  relieve  pressure to  seek  refinancing  of \nmaturing loans. Finally, cash flow generated from group operations rose from D1,452 trillion in \n2006 to D2,128  trillion in 2007.

In  undertaking  capital  projects  in  the  past  under  the  direction  of  the  Ministry  of \nConstruction, Song Da has relied on capital injections from the Government, the proceeds of the \nequitization exercise, and bank loans to fund the projects. So far, Song Da has been successful \nin all its projects, and the rate of return realized from projects has been significantly higher than \nthe cost of financing. Hence, it has so far enjoyed strong support from shareholders and \nbankers. Although some of the maturing loans can be settled only with the proceeds from new \nloans, these new loans are within the borrowing capacity of Song Da. In any case, the group \nhas no history of default. \n \nD.  Industry Outlook \n12.  With gross domestic product growth expected to average 6% in the foreseeable future, \nthe outlook of the industries in which the subsidiaries of Song Da are involved\u2014hydropower \ngeneration,  hydropower  plant  construction,  manufacturing  and  distributing  such  industrial \nproducts  as  cement  and  steel,  and  general  infrastructure  construction  and  property \ndevelopment\u2014is generally bright. Moreover, with the strong Governmental support that Song \nDa enjoys, its operating subsidiaries are poised to benefit from continuing high growth in Viet \nNam. The Government has announced the involvement of Song Da in the development of some \nmajor infrastructure projects. \n \nE.  Impact of the Corporate, Management, and Financial Restructuring on the Future \nPerformance of Song Da and Projections \n13.  Following the implementation of recommended restructuring under tranche 1 of the \nState-Owned  Enterprise  Reform  and  Corporate  Governance  Facilitation  Program,  group \noperations will be restructured under four business segments and managed by four sub-holding \ncompanies, each focusing on one business segment. These sub-holding companies and their \nsubsidiaries  will  enjoy  many  benefits:  well-coordinated  and  streamlined  business  activities, \neconomies of scale and scope, enhanced strategic focus, standardized business processes and \nprocedures, enhanced competency and capacity of people, and enhanced accountability and \n \nreporting systems. These benefits may be manifested in the future as innovation of more and \nbetter  products,  better  market  acceptance  and  confidence,  enlarged  market  share,  higher \nproductivity  and  efficiency,  efficient  management  and  reporting  processes,  and  a  more \ncontrolled but progressive working environment. Standardization of business processes and \nmanagement procedures will bring about marked operational benefits and savings. All these \nbenefits will contribute to enhanced competitiveness and the long-term sustainability of group \nprofitability. It is difficult, however, to quantify these benefits accurately at this stage. It is \nnevertheless expected that, in the short term, there will be at least interest savings from the \nlower interest rate of the OCR loan and other savings from the removal of duplication of \nresources,  in  terms  of  staff  numbers  and  related  facilities  and  equipment,  and  enhanced \nutilization of available resources, assets, and equipment. The OCR loan of $117.5 million will \nhelp ease the pressure from bank loan repayment obligations and enhance the financial position \nof the group. It is estimated these restructuring measures will translate into an improvement of \nat least 5% in general management and administrative expenses of the group. \n \n14.  The projections for the group are based on past trends in sales and cost of sales and the \nrelationship between them. Consequently, they are subject to the limitations of the financial \ninformation available, particularly due to the non-elimination of intra-group sales and purchases, \nimplying  that  projected  net  profits  are  likely  overstated.  At  the  same  time,  the  estimated \n ", " 5 0  Appendix 6 \nprojections are based on the minimum estimated reductions of operating expenses.

Proposed Covenants \n15.  Given the continuing need for the country to develop further hydropower-generating \ncapacity, Song Da will continue to incur indebtedness to fund its projects. The group will no \ndoubt generate substantial cash flow in the future as its newly constructed hydropower plants \nbegin operation. In the meantime, there is a need to observe prudent financial management. As \nthe group is engaged in a capital-intensive industry, a maximum long-term debt-to-equity ratio of \n4:1 and minimum debt-service coverage ratio of 1.5 are proposed as financial covenants to \nensure that the debt and debt-service capacity of the four sub-holding companies of Song Da \nremain within prudent limits. Although the debt-to-equity position for each of the four sub-holding \ncompanies is expected to steadily decrease, and for the debt-service coverage ratio increase, \nsurplus  cash  flows  generated  from  operations  may  be  inadequate  to  fund  further  capital \nexpenditures  required  during  the  projection  period,  depending  on  the  Government\u2019s \ndevelopment agenda. Hence, it is important to include a minimum self-financing ratio of 25% to \nensure that the sub-holding companies generate adequate cash flows to finance a reasonable \nportion of their capital investments, so that their leveraging remains within prudent limits. \n \nG.  Conclusion \n16.  Despite its ambitious capital expansion program, Song Da would appear to maintain its \nfinancial viability operating through four sub-holding companies. It is reasonable to expect that \nthe group and each of the sub-holding companies will be able to comply with the financial \ncovenants over the projection period. Under the proposed new corporate structure of the Song \nDa group, the sub-holding companies, which are all publicly listed companies, will have the \nflexibility to source the additional funds required for implementing capital projects from the \ncapital market. \n \n ", " 5 4  Appendix 7 \n \nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND PROJECTIONS OF SOWATCO \n \nA.

It is a holding company, following the \nparent company\u2013subsidiary model per Decision No. 1863/QD-BGTVT of the Ministry of \nTransportation, dated 26 June 2003. It completed its equitization in 2008. Towards the end \nof 2008, it undertook an initial public offering, which was completed in January 2009. As of \n31 December 2007, the general corporation had 1,059 employees and assets of D920.6 \nbillion. \n \n2.  The main lines of business for Sowatco are transportation and logistics services, both \nof which have seen rapidly increasing demand in the past few years in the Mekong Delta. \nSowatco has been able to take advantage of this trend, but, to cope with the future demand \nfor  logistics  services  resulting  from  sustained  economic  growth  in  the  Mekong  Delta, \nSowatco would need to make considerable investments in expanding the scale and scope of \nits current business and upgrading its business infrastructure and operational facilities. To do \nthis, it requires more financial support to help fund its future growth.  \n \n3.  Many practices and processes that would be expected in large enterprises in other \ncountries with comparable income per capital are not found in businesses in Viet Nam. \nThere  are  considerable  gaps  in  the  data  available  on  the  operations  of  the  general \ncorporations that reflect the structural constraints of an economy in transition from central \nplanning to a market-based system and accounting and auditing standards and practices still \ndeveloping. Audited accounts of all the general corporations have comments and/or caveats. \nThere is no information on transactions between companies within groups. There are no \nmarket projections. Investment feasibility studies lack adequate data analysis, and most \ngeneral  corporations  do  not  have  cash  flow  projections.  Attempts have  been made  to \naddress the data gaps to the extent possible, but the analysis below remains constrained by \nthe structural constraints on data availability. \n \nB.  Historical Performance \n4.  For 2005 and 2006, the net contribution from sales was barely sufficient to cover \nadministration and finance expenses. In 2007, sales were supplemented by interest income. \nIn the 3 years to 2007, the operating profit margin stayed low at 0%\u20132%, mainly because the \naverage price of fuel more than doubled, from D4,800/liter in 2005 to more than D10,000/liter \nin 2007. At the same time, transportation charges could not be increased, as they are \ncontrolled by the Ministry of Transportation, thus affecting the gross margin of the logistics  \nactivities stevedoring and transportation. The increased cost of lubricants and fuel oil also \nadversely affected the volume of trade in the Mekong Delta, reducing the utilization rate of \nbarges and related support equipment. \n ", "Appendix 7    55\nFigure A7.1: Sowatco's Income Statement, 2005\u20132007 \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n    COGS =  cost of goods sold. \n    Source: Sowatco. \n \n  Figure A7.2: Return on Equity Trends of Various Components \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n   \n   \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n   \n \n    Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n5.  The significant increase in return on equity and profit margin in 2007 was due to \nrecognition of an exceptional profit of D47.3 billion arising from a change in accounting \ntreatment of the general corporation\u2019s interest in joint ventures and associates. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", " 5 6  Appendix 7 \n \n \nFigure A7.3: Sowatco: Current Assets and Liabilities, 2007 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      Source: Sowatco. \n \n6.  Asset turnover is low because of ongoing construction at the Long Binh port. Net \ncurrent assets, fixed assets, and long-term investment are mainly financed by equity. The \nasset-to-equity ratio is low, and long-term borrowing accounts for only 9% of net total capital.  \n \n7.  In the 3 years from 2005 to 2007, return on assets was low, at 1%\u20132%. Cash \ngenerated  by  operations  was  insufficient  to  cover  loan  repayments,  which  had  to  be \nrefinancing by other loans. Towards the end of 2008, Sowatco received the proceeds of the \ninitial public offering, which was completed in January 2009.

The outlook for the development of the logistics industry in the Mekong Delta is \naffected by the following: \n(i)  Port capacity in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) is expected to double between \n2010  and  2020,  and  goods-handling  targets  for  HCMC  ports  are  set  to \nincrease from 100 to 200 million tons per year in the same period.1  \n                                                 \n1 Vietnam News, 2008. 3 November. \n ", " 5 8  Appendix 7 \n \n(ii)  Container cargo is expected to grow at 25% a year. The general corporation \ntransports mostly rice, clinker, fertilizer, and building materials, and this cargo \nmix is expected to be sustainable. \n(iii)  Government plans to move several city ports to the suburbs, while leaving \nVietnam  International  Container  Terminals  in  HCMC.  This  will  increase \ndemand for waterborne transportation within HCMC in the future.  \n \nE.  Expected  Impact  of  the  Restructuring  Exercise  on  the  Future  Operating \nPerformance of the Group \n10.  Sowatco believes that, with the ordinary capital resources (OCR) loan from the Asian \nDevelopment Bank, pressure on repayment will be greatly reduced. The general corporation \nwill be able to focus on opportunities to invest and improve its service package and service \ndelivery process. It will be in a position to provide integrated service, which is badly needed \nby the business community along the Mekong River. Sowatco hopes to be the first logistics \ncompany in the region to offer door-to-door services and total logistics solutions. This, \ntogether with the restructuring the company has undertaken to implement, will bring a \nsignificant improvement in the company\u2019s scale of operations and operational efficiency. In \naddition, the commencement of operations at Long Binh port will further complement its \noperations. All these developments will propel Sowatco\u2019s revenue and profitability going \nforward.  \n \n11.  The immediate financial benefit of taking on the OCR and ADF loans is that Sowatco \nwill save costs by refinancing with the OCR loan. It will enjoy further interest savings from \nreduced borrowing as deferment of repayment the OCR loan improves cash flow. Equally \nimportant  will  be  the  operational  benefits,  as  the  implementation  of  management \nreorganization and operational restructuring will generate savings from better utilization of \nexisting assets and interest savings attributable to proceeds from the disposal of redundant \nassets. There will be savings from eliminating unproductive procedures and processes. \nThese improvements are expected reduce general and administrative expenses by at least \n5%.  \n \n12.

Song Da \n1.  Introduction \n1.  The  Song  Da  group  of  companies  is  engaged  mainly  in  four  business  segments: \nhydropower plant construction, power trading, property development, and industrial production. \nUnder the proposed corporate restructuring, the business of the general corporation will be \nshifted to appropriate subsidiaries, which will be grouped under four sub-holding companies. \nEach sub-holding company and its subsidiaries will focus on one of the four business segments, \nwhile the parent general corporation will be more of a holding company. \n2.  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  lending  will  finance  the  operational  restructuring \nthrough the Asian Development Fund (ADF) loan and corporate and debt restructuring through \nthe ordinary capital resources (OCR) loan. There will be no physical investments under ADB \nlending, and no new assets will be created at Song Da. Many projects at various stages of \nimplementation underlie the debts to be restructured under the State-Owned Enterprise Reform \nand Corporate Governance Facilitation Program. It is thus neither feasible nor meaningful to \ncalculate the financial internal rate of return (FIRR) or net present value (NPV) for each of the \nvarious projects whose debt will be restructured under the OCR facility. Instead, return on \ncapital employed for each of the subgroup or sub-holding companies is calculated. The financial \nviability of Song Da following the restructuring supported by ADB must be established. This can \nbest be evaluated by appraising the financial position of each of the four sub-holding companies \nand their subsidiaries. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is calculated for each of \nthe four subgroups and compared with the return on capital employed of each of the subgroups \nto ascertain the financial viability of each subgroup. Sensitivity to adverse movements of each \nsubgroup was also assessed. These analyses clearly show that the financial viability of each \nsubgroup will continue to improve over time. \n3.  Financial  analysis  is  constrained  by  considerable  gaps  in  the  financial  information \navailable on the operations of the general corporations. The data gaps reflect the structural \nconstraints of an economy in transition from central planning to a market-based system. Audited \naccounts of all the general corporations have comments and caveats. There is no information \non  transactions  between  companies  within  the  group.  There  are  no  market  projections. \nInvestment feasibility studies lack adequate data analysis, and most general corporations do not \nhave cash flow projections. Attempts have been made to address the data gaps to the extent \npossible, but the analysis below remains constrained by some of the structural constraints on \ndata availability. \n2.  Methodology \n4.  Under the proposed restructuring plan, the operations of Song Da will be grouped under \nfour sub-holding companies. The comparison with and without the proposed lending has to \ncompare, therefore, the present structure and its operations with the operations under the new \nstructure. As such, the projections of each of the sub-holding companies and their subsidiaries \nare worked out with and without ADB lending. The numbers for each group are then regrouped \nto arrive at consolidated numbers for Song Da as a whole. These numbers then become the \nbase case for sensitivity analysis.  \n \n ", "  Appendix 8  63 \n5.  As envisaged in the proposed restructuring plan, each of the sub-holding companies, \nwhich are all listed, is set to become an iconic company in its field, with technical and economic \ncapacity to undertake bigger projects and those with more value added and avail itself of \ncheaper options to meet future financing needs. This may include the possibility of listing in \nregional bourses in Southeast Asia. All these developments will add to the financial stability of \nthe subgroups. \n \n3.  Assumptions \n6.  The financial analysis is carried out in real terms on an after-tax basis. The projected \nsales are determined based on planned and expected increases in capacity and normal growth \nas realized in the recent past. As a conservative estimate, the gross profit margin for each \nbusiness segment is assumed to be the same with or without reorganization. For the expected \nscenario of the subgroups, the benefits of reorganization are expected to reduce controllable \ngeneral management and administrative expenses by 5%. It is assumed that inflation will affect \nincome and expenditure to the same extent.  \n \n7.  The other assumptions include an international US dollar interest rate of 1%, a tax rate \nof 25%, and 2.5% for the minimum interest rate test in view of prevailing low international \ninterest rates.

Weighted Average Cost of Capital \n8.  The WACC is calculated for each of the subgroups assuming there will be no more \ncapital contribution from shareholders and that future financing needs will be funded by retained \nearnings and loans.  \n \n9.  The cost of equity of each of subgroup is estimated using the capital asset pricing \nmodel. The risk-free rate of 8.5% has been used based as the prevailing rate of government \nbonds denominated in local currency. The market risk premium for Viet Nam is taken as 11%, \nbased  on  the  average  return  on listed companies  in  Viet  Nam.  The  equity  beta  for  each \nbusiness segment is estimated to be 0.85, based on the listed companies engaged in similar \nbusinesses in other developing countries. This results in a WACC for subgroups during 2009\u2013\n2019 ranging from 8.02% to 11.2% as shown in Table A8.2. \n \n ", " 6 4  Appendix 8 \n \nTable A8.2: Weighted Average Cost of Capital \n(%) \nHydropower Plant  Industrial \nYear  Power Trading  Property Development \nConstruction  Production \n2009  8.51  8.2  8.0  10.1 \n2010  8.22  8.5  8.2  10.2 \n2011  8.07  8.6  8.3  10.7 \n2012  8.03  8.1  8.2  11.2 \n2013  8.08  8.2  8.3  11.2 \n2014  8.12  8.6  8.5  11.2 \n2015  8.23  8.7  8.7  11.2 \n2016  8.38  8.8  8.8  11.2 \n2017  8.54  8.8  8.9  11.2 \n2018  8.71  9.0  9.1  11.2 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n5.  Return of Capital Employed \n10.  Since the OCR loans are to be given for sub-holding companies to restructure debts \nincurred to finance projects implemented in the past by subsidiaries, it is neither feasible nor \nmeaningful to calculate FIRR and NPV for each of the projects. Instead, return on capital \nemployed is calculated for comparison. The calculation of return on capital is based on the \nassumption that profitability will be enhanced with the implementation of restructuring and the \nresulting estimated reduction of at least 5% in general administrative expenses. \nTable A8.3: Return on Capital Employed \n(%) \nItem\u00a0 FY09F  FY10F  FY11F  FY12F  FY13F  FY14F  FY15F  FY16F  FY17F  FY18F \nReturn on capital \n11.58  11.34  11.37  11.28  11.66  11.93  12.25  12.61  12.77  12.99 \nemployed \n \nFY  = fiscal year, F = forecast. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \n6.  Sensitivity Analysis \n11.  The sensitivity to adverse movements in sales and cost of sales has been computed to \nassess the robustness of the financial analysis of Song Da group. Inadequacy in the financial \ninformation on the general corporation and the resulting lack of information on the relationship \nbetween production or throughput volume or utilization rates of income-generating assets as \nrelated to expenses and details of the composition of cost items requires the analysis of sales \nand cost of sales to be on an aggregate basis. Consequently, the maximum adverse movement \nconsidered is a 10% change in sales and cost of sales. \n \n12.

Subject  to  the  effects  of  imperfections  in  the  underlying  projection  numbers,  the \nsensitivity  analysis  indicates  that  the  financial  viability  of  power  plant  construction,  power \ntrading,  and  property  development  subgroups  is  sufficiently  robust  to  withstand  adverse \nmovements in the volume of business and cost of sales. However, the viability of the subgroup \nmanufacturing industrial products is sensitive to an increase in production costs. Hence, greater \nmanagement attention must be focused on this business segment to enhance the business \nmodel of this subgroup. The financial viability of the Song Da group of companies as a whole is \naffirmed by the sensitivity analysis. \n \nB.  Sowatco \n1.  Introduction \n14.  Sowatco mainly provides logistics and related services. Under the proposed corporate \nrestructuring, the business of Sowatco will first be shifted down to appropriate subsidiaries \nengaged  in  similar  businesses.  Investments  in  non-core  activities  will  be  disposed  of. \nSubsequently, Sowatco will serve as an investment holding company with subsidiaries that \nprovide such logistics-related services as port services, the bulk handling of rice through buy \nand sell arrangements, and river barge transport. Going forward, management intends to invest \nin warehousing and land transport services to compliment its current river barge services and \nenable an integrated door-to-door service. \n \n15.  With the implementation of the recommended restructuring, Sowatco is set become a \nkey player in the logistics industry in the Mekong Delta, with technical and economic capacity to \nexpand and attract higher-end customers and at the same time avail itself of cheaper options to \nmeet  future  financing  needs.  This  may  include  listing  on  regional  bourses.  All  these \ndevelopments will add to its long-term financial stability. \n \n16.  Sensitivity to adverse movements was assessed. These analyses clearly show that the \nfinancial viability of Sowatco will improve over time. The methodology and assumptions used for \nSowatco are identical to those used for the analysis of Song Da. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 8  67 \nTable A8.8: Capital Expenditure Program of Sowatco, 2009\u20132018 \n(D million) \n \nLong Binh \nYear  Port  Lorries  Barges  Ships  Warehouse  Total \n2009             \n2010  61,480  7,500        68,980 \n2011  61,480  7,500  62,476  26,666  7,088  165,209 \n2012    3,300  17,181      20,481 \n2013    3,630  18,899      22,529 \n2014    3,993  20,789      24,782 \n2015    4,392  22,868      27,260 \n2016    4,832  25,155      29,986 \n2017    5,315  27,670      32,985 \n2018    5,846  30,437      36,283 \n  Total  122,959  46,308  225,474  26,666  7,088  428,494 \nSource: Sowatco. \n \n \n2.  Weighted Average Cost of Capital  \n17.  The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is calculated using the same assumptions \nand methodology as for Song Da: no additional capital contribution from shareholders, future \nfinancing through retained earnings and loans, a US dollar interest rate of 1.5%, and a tax rate \nof 25%.  \n \n18.  The cost of Sowatco equity is estimated using the capital asset pricing model. The risk-\nfree  rate  of  8.5%  has  been  used,  based  on  the  prevailing  rate  of  government  bonds \ndenominated in local currency. The market risk premium for Viet Nam is taken as 11%, based \non  the  average  return  on  listed  companies  in  Viet  Nam.  The  equity  beta  for  Sowatco  is \nestimated to be 0.85, based on the listed companies engaged in similar business in other \ndeveloping countries. The WACC to Sowatco during 2009\u20132019 is 11%. \n \n3.  Return on Capital Employed \n19.  As with Song Da, the OCR loan to Sowatco will not finance new physical investments \nbut restructure previous debts. Neither FIRR nor NPV is therefore feasible or meaningful, and \nreturn on capital employed is instead calculated for comparison with the WACC. As before, \nexpected  enhancement  in  profitability  arising  from  restructuring  has  not  been  taken  into \naccount. \n \nTable A8.9: Sowatco\u2019s Return on Capital Employed \n(%) \n \nYear  2009  2010  2011  2012  2013  2014  2015  2016  2017  2018 \nReturn                     \non capital  13  13  12  12  22  22  21  25  23  21 \nemployed \n \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n ", " 6 8  Appendix 8 \n \n4.

Macroeconomic Context \n1.  After  a  sustained  period  of  high  economic  growth,  Viet  Nam's  economy  has  faced \nsignificant challenges since 2007. The growth rate declined from 8.5% in 2007 to 6.25% in \n2008, the lowest rate in almost a decade. A policy tilt towards growth relative to stability led to \nhigh public sector spending. Combined with large capital inflows and spikes in energy and food \nprices, this caused historically high inflation of about 28% in the second quarter of 2008 and \nlarge trade deficits. The dong came under severe depreciation pressure. The Government of \nViet Nam (the Government) acted strongly to stabilize the economy and managed to reduce \ninflation, though growth momentum also slowed. The economy has been affected too by the \nglobal financial crisis and economic downturn. The Government has sought to expand its fiscal \nand monetary polices in response, which has raised concerns about currency depreciation and \nfiscal deficit. Weaknesses in the banking sector and the state-owned enterprise (SOE) sector \ncompound the difficulties faced by the Government in designing and implementing policies to \nensure macroeconomic and financial stability in a challenging global environment. \n \n2.  According to the latest debt sustainability analysis of Viet Nam, the country remains at \nlow  risk  of  debt  distress  despite  recent  deterioration  in  its  economic  conditions,  primarily \nbecause of favorable indicators of external debt sustainability reflecting access to concessional \nand long-term external debt and high growth rates for exports. Public sector debt, including \ndomestic debt, will need to be managed more carefully with deterioration in the overall fiscal \nbalance. Contingent liabilities, including those related to addressing problems in SOEs, are an \nadded vulnerability.  \n \nB.   Sector Analysis \n3.  The  Government  initiated  ambitious  and  comprehensive  economic  and  structural \nreforms  in  the  late  1980s  to  shift  the  economy  towards  a  more  market-oriented  system. \nHowever, SOE reform has proceeded very slowly. SOE equitization\u2014the process of converting \nSOEs into joint stock companies with limited liability\u2014was launched as early as mid-1992, but \nby the end of 1997 only 17 enterprises had been equitized. As of December 2007, nearly 5,000 \nSOEs had been equitized or otherwise converted, and about 1,600 enterprises remained to be \nequitized. The SOE sector in 2007 accounted for approximately 40% of the gross domestic \nproduct and 30% of credit in the economy.  \n \n4.  Most of the SOEs equitized early on were small. In the mid-1990s, the Government \norganized most SOEs into 17 general corporations or conglomerates reporting to the Prime \nMinister  (GC91s)  and  77  special  general  corporations  under  line  ministries  and  provincial \npeople\u2019s committees (GC90s). In 2002, these 94 general corporations included 1,605 member \nSOEs, representing 28% of all SOEs and 65% of the capital of all SOEs. The remaining SOEs \nthat have yet to be equitized are mainly the GC90s and GC91s. In 2006, the Government \napproved a master plan including a list of general corporations identified for equitization. The \nplan was for about 20 general corporations to be equitized every year from 2007\u20132010. As of 31 \nMay 2008, none of the GC91s and only 7 of the GC90s had been equitized. \n \n5.  SOE  reform  has  been  constrained  by  several  factors.  The  initial  approach  of  the \nGovernment was flawed, focusing primarily on small SOEs and on quantity rather than quality \nand emphasizing equitization without considering listing as integral to SOE transformation. The \n ", " 7 0  Appendix 9 \n \nSOEs equitized were too small to be listed and continued to operate inefficiently, dependent on \nlarger SOEs and the state for business. The really difficult part\u2014equitizing and transforming \nlarge general corporations\u2014has yet to start in a meaningful way. \n \n6.  Equitizing general corporations is complicated by their large size and diverse scope of \noperations through many subsidiaries that are not always controlled by the parent general \ncorporation. This makes valuating the general corporation's shares in its subsidiaries difficult. \nValuation  is  further  made  difficult  by  inadequate  documentation  of  SOE  assets  and  land \nvaluation. Another critical constraint on general corporation equitization has been their financial \nweakness because of excessively high debt. General corporations have relied extensively on \nloans from the Government and state-owned commercial banks and have gearing ratios of debt \nover equity considerably higher than 1. This has severely constrained their ability to service their \ndebts and contributed to the high number of nonperforming loans in the banking system. High \nindebtedness implies that the general corporations are ill-equipped to deal with risks and will not \nhave the financial capacity to fund capital investments. The problem is exacerbated by much of \ntheir debt being high cost and short term.  \n \n7.  The Government is aware that restructuring general corporations is crucial to reforming \nSOEs and reducing risks to state finances from SOEs. Despite slow progress, the Government \nremains committed to SOE reform and will review and revise its master plan when it ends in \n2010. The Government has agreed that a comprehensive approach to transforming general \ncorporations is necessary, going beyond mere equitization. Equitization is only one step in a \nsuccessful transformation process for SOEs and needs to be complemented, even preceded, by \na  host  of  other  steps,  including  strategic  and  business  planning,  corporate  and  financial \nrestructuring,  attracting  investment  and  corporate  financing,  forming  value-adding  business \npartnerships  or  alliances,  and  implementing  more  transparent  governance.  Enhancing  the \nmarket education of management and staff, modernizing management information systems and \nhuman  resource  development  systems,  and  possibly  listing  on  the  stock  exchange,  are \nadditional steps and challenges that need to be addressed for effective and comprehensive \ntransformation. The first tranche of the proposed facility will be a pilot project to demonstrate a \nsuccessful and sustainable model for transforming general corporations.  \n \nC.   Economic Costs and Benefits of Tranche 1 Subprojects  \n8.  Tranche 1 of the proposed facility will provide ordinary capital resources loans to two \ngeneral corporations\u2014Song Da and Sowatco\u2014to undertake debt restructuring. In addition, \nAsian  Development  Fund  (ADF)  loans  to  both  general  corporations  will  be  provided  to \nimplement operational restructuring and improve corporate governance. Further, as part of \ntranche 1, ADF lending will be provided to the Debt and Asset Trading Corporation (DATC) to \nimprove its resolution of nonperforming and distressed assets. DATC will use the funds for \noperational restructuring and improved governance. The Government will onlend the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) loans to the participating general corporations and DATC. \n \n9.  The valuation of the costs and benefits of tranche 1 subprojects of the facility follows \nADB\u2019s  guidelines.1 The  costs  to  society  are  the  investments  in  the  subprojects,  with  total \ninvestment costs at $130 million, consisting of $120 million for debt restructuring and $10 million \nfor operational restructuring. Since the operational restructuring does not impose any changes \nin the labor force at any of the participating entities and has only modest investments such as in \ninformation  technology  systems  to  support  the  restructured  management  and  operational \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.  Manila. \n ", "  Appendix 9  71 \nprocesses, recurrent or operating costs are negligible. Debt restructuring is not expected to lead \nto investments or improved operation and maintenance, and are akin to transfer payments. For \nboth  the  debt  restructuring  and  the  operational  restructuring  components,  therefore,  the \nincremental costs of the investments are negligible. Given the negligible incremental costs and \nbenefits that, while substantial, are difficult to quantify meaningfully (see below), it was decided \nnot to estimate economic internal rate of return and focus instead on qualitative aspects of the \npotential economic benefits and returns. \n \n10.  Benefits. The project benefits are mainly unlocking and unleashing the latent value of \nSOE assets. The ordinary capital resources loan is used to restructure the debt of the two \ngeneral corporations to the tune of $120 million. The general corporations pay off the existing \ncreditor banks and owe the money instead to the Government, which owes it to ADB. The banks \ncan lend the money thus released to other borrowers. In other words, the ADB loan is an \ninjection of additional resources in a resource-constrained system. The net result is that (i) $120 \nmillion  in  new  debt  from  ADB  is  matched  by  new  projects  worth  $120  million  equivalent \nlaunched by new borrowers from the present creditor banks of the general corporations and (ii) \nthese additional resources come at a lower cost to the economy. However, it would not be \npossible at this stage to quantify the size, nature, and timing of economic costs and benefits of \nthe new projects.  \n \n11.  For the ADF loan, the investment cost is $10 million equivalent to reorganize the general \ncorporations and DATC. These are not revenue-generating investments per se, but their impact \nis  to  make  the  general  corporations  more  efficient  by  either  reducing  costs  or  increasing \nrevenues through  better selection of projects, or both. The result is an increase in net revenues. \nThe financial model has estimated that, with the ADB project improving operations under the \nnew  corporate  management  structure,  general  management  and  administration  costs  will \ndecline by 5% compared with the \u201cwithout project\u201d scenario. As a conservative estimate, even if \nthe gross profit margin for each business segment is assumed to be the same before and after \nimplementation, the expected returns are substantial. They remain substantial even if underlying \nassumptions are revised to incorporate adverse scenarios such as lower savings in general \nadministration and operation costs and higher future inflation or a combination of the two. \n \n12.  The proposed investment aims to make DATC more efficient. This would mean being \nbetter able to restructure the assets DATC has and sell them at higher prices (an effect that will \nbe magnified if government regulations change to improve the effectiveness of debt and asset \nresolution and state management of capital). At the moment, DATC has a recovery rate for \nreceived debt in terms of book value at only 10%, and 14,764 items of nonperforming assets, \nout  of  19,526  items  in  its  portfolio  with  total  book  value  of  D659  billion,  are  considered \nirrecoverable. More important benefits will accrue from DATC being better able to perform its \neconomic role, even if the global economic downturn adversely affects enterprises over the \nshort to medium term.  \n \n \n ", "72   Appendix 10 \n \n  SUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \nCountry and Project Title: Viet Nam/State-Owned Enterprise Reform and Corporate Governance Facilitation Program \n \nSoutheast Asia Department \nLending/Financing  Department/ \nMultitranche Financing Facility  Financial Sector, Public Management and Trade \nModality:  Division: \nDivision \nI.  POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA. Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nTransformation and reform of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) is critical to reducing the dominance of inefficient \nstate production, promoting private sector development, and enhancing sustainable economic growth in Viet \nNam.  The  Socio-Economic  Development  Plan  (SEDP)  2006\u20132010  of  the  Government  of  Viet  Nam  (the \nGovernment) called for diversifying ownership to improve SOE efficiency and competitiveness. In addition to \nexpanding the scale and scope of SOE equitization, the SEDP envisaged narrowing and eliminating the role of \nministries and other state entities in SOE governance and management.  \n \nADB's country strategy and program 2007\u20132010 (CSP)a underlined SOE reforms as central to its strategy of \nbusiness development and private sector-led employment growth. The CSP called for continued SOE reforms to \nreduce barriers to private sector development, reduce corruption and the misuse of public resources, and \nenhance transparency and corporate governance. The outcome of the CSP for the SOE sector is enhanced SOE \nprofitability and transparency. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification:  General intervention \n \nMeasures for general corporation restructuring and institutional strengthening supported by the State-Owned \nEnterprise Reform and Corporate Governance Facilitation Program do not have a direct impact on poverty. No \nnew physical investments or assets will be created. \n \nTransforming general corporations will help capture the static and dynamic efficiency gains through the improved \nallocation  and  utilization  of  resources  to  promote  higher  growth  and  private  sector  development.  Greater \nprofitability  and  improved  corporate  governance  of  SOEs  will  reduce  the  fiscal  weight  of  inefficient  state \nenterprises,  freeing  up  state  resources  for  promoting  inclusive  growth.  Greater  access  to  resources  will \nstrengthen the ability of the Government to withstand adverse shocks such as the current global crisis, which \noften affect the poor and vulnerable most. Successfully transforming general corporations will contribute to the \ndevelopment of capital markets by improving the supply of high-quality issuances from iconic or blue chip \ncompanies. Capital market development will strengthen the resilience of the financial sector, reducing the \nlikelihood and severity of financial and economic crises and helping safeguard against a corresponding increase \nin poverty. \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nRestructuring general corporations will not directly affect any specific groups. No new physical investments or \nassets will be created, and there will be only indirect socioeconomic effects. General corporation transformation \nas proposed under the facility will benefit many SOE workers, who were the dominant buyers of shares in the \nsmall SOEs equitized earlier on. Many of these small SOEs have continued to languish in inefficiency, dependent \nupon the larger SOEs and general corporations for survival. Their shares, often sold in the parallel market, have \nlost value and become more illiquid with the downturn in capital markets. The proposed corporate restructuring \nunder the facility will enable many SOE shareholders to trade their illiquid shares of small equitized SOEs for the \nshares of large, efficient sub-holding companies that may even be listed on the stock exchange.  \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 10  73 \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1. Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \nExtensive consultations were undertaken with all Government agencies concerned with SOE reform and with \ngeneral corporations that were potential participants in first tranche. Seminars were held for middle and senior \nmanagement  in  participating  general  corporations  and  institutions  and,  separately,  for  their  boards  of \nmanagement. \n \n2. What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \nWhile formal stakeholder analysis and participation in the preparation of the program are not discrete outputs, the \nrestructuring measures supported under the facility reflect wide-ranging stakeholder consultations and inputs, \nparticularly within the participating entities and other government agencies. \n \nC.   Gender and Development \n \nThe general corporation restructuring and institutional capacity building proposed under the facility are gender \nneutral. Nonetheless, to ensure that any redeployment needed is without negative gender impact, assurance will \nbe sought from the Government in the framework financing agreement to address training and redeployment with \ngender neutrality. Training programs will need to cater to the skills requirements of female workers to ensure that \nfemale and male workers alike are successfully retrained and redeployed. \n \nIII.
