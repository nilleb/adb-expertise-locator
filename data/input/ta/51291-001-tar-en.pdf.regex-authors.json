INTRODUCTION\n1. The  knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  strengthen  knowledge\npartnerships on emerging themes relevant to regional cooperation and integration (RCI) by\nencouraging and supporting research collaboration among policy research institutions in Asia and\nthe Pacific. It will also support research networks by organizing technical workshops and high-\nlevel policy dialogues to produce policy papers and a book and/or report volume for policy makers\nin the region.\n2. The TA is included in the 2018 annual work program for the Economic Research and\nRegional Cooperation Department (ERCD) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to build policy\nresearch capacity in institutions in developing member countries.1 The TA objectives are also\nlinked to the Operational Plan for Regional Cooperation and Integration, 2016\u20132020, which\nfocuses on (i) collective action for multicountry mechanisms promoting trade, investment, and\nlabor mobility; (ii) regional public health, climate change, and disaster risk mitigation; and (iii)\nstrong cooperation mechanisms requiring collective action.2\nII. ISSUES\n3. Regional integration has played a pivotal role economic and social development in Asia\nand the Pacific by expanding markets and boosting productivity. It also helps the development\nprocess become more inclusive, bringing with it important noneconomic benefits of security and\npolitical stability. The European Union is an example of a deeply interconnected region that has\ngained considerable efficiency through trading and the sharing of natural and human resources.\n4. To continue taking advantage of the benefits of regional integration, policy makers must\ncooperate closely on the economic and related development agendas that are of mutual interest\nto countries in Asia and the Pacific. These agendas include economic issues such as trade and\nregional value chains, social issues such as human capital and inclusive growth, environmental\nconcerns, and calls for regional actions that go beyond domestic or bilateral remedies.\n5. Knowledge management helps policy makers respond to challenges and opportunities by\ngenerating and disseminating targeted research. Regional research collaboration among groups\nof experts who stay informed about the context, priorities, constraints, and challenges of regional\nand national policies is key to generating policy-relevant knowledge on RCI. Collaboration can\nconsist of jointly identifying key policy agenda and research questions; sharing data, research\nmethods,  and  techniques  to  conduct  proposed  research;  and  drafting  and  adopting  policy\nrecommendations  based  on  research  outcomes.  Collaboration  also  generates  synergies  in\nmaking research outcomes broadly relevant, actionable, and effective. Knowledge management,\nin the context of the RCI agenda, will help individual countries identify regional solutions to region-\nwide concerns.\n6. Although ADB\u2019s research efforts and publication of flagship reports and other research\ninitiatives have increased the volume of literature on issues such as trade and value chains, the\nnumber and the quality of RCI research collaborations are insufficient in other areas, such as the\nfollowing:\n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 8 April 2018. \n2  ADB. 2016. Operational Plan for Regional Cooperation and Integration, 2016\u20132020: Promoting Connectivity, \nCompetitiveness, Regional Public Goods, and Collective Action for Asia and the Pacific. Manila. ", "2 \n(i)  Aging, demographic change, technology, and labor mobility. Populations are \naging and workforces are shrinking in many countries, including in emerging \neconomies. These demographic changes will have an impact on labor markets and \noverall patterns of economic structure and growth, and on the ways in which labor \nmoves across regional borders. Technology plays an increasing role in boosting \nthe productivity of workers, including the elderly. Given diverse demographic \nprofiles, regional efforts by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) \nto plan human capital development and facilitate cross-border labor mobility will \nbenefit the region. However, such efforts may require inputs from regional experts \nacross  multiple  disciplines,  including  demography,  public  finance,  and  labor \neconomics. To date, ADB\u2019s research on aging and demographic changes has \nfocused on aging and the social security and/or care system or economic growth \nin  general  but  none  has  approached  the  issue  from  the  angle  of  regional \ncollaboration.3 \n(ii)  Disaster risk reduction frameworks. While Asia and the Pacific is increasingly \nexperiencing the impact of climate change and recurring natural disasters, the \nburden for coping and rebuilding falls mostly on small and vulnerable economies. \nThe need to strengthen regional cooperation and the mechanism for sharing \ndisaster risks is urgent. Innovative ways to mitigate risk have already emerged, \nsuch as disaster risk financing and insurance, which ADB and the World Bank are \nimplementing in selected countries. The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk \nReduction, 2015\u20132030 recognizes the significant role of regional cooperation in \naddressing  the  increasing  threat  of  disasters.4 The  Asia  Regional  Plan  for \nImplementation of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, 2015\u20132030 \nprovides broad policy direction, a long-term plan, and a 2-year action plan for \nregional cooperation and collaboration on building risk resilience.5 A study can look \nat how regional cooperation can help develop the region's resilience to disasters \nby  (a)  better  understanding,  assessing,  and  monitoring  disaster  risk;  (b) \nstrengthening disaster risk governance; and (c) improving coordination across \nrelevant institutions, sectors, and countries. \n \n7.  Several reasons may explain why collaborative research on these topics has not taken \nplace. First, a country\u2019s incentive to invest in regional cooperation and RCI knowledge can be \nstifled by the high cost of conducting the research on its own when the results could benefit other \nnations, especially those at its border. Second, since Asia and the Pacific consists of countries \nwith diverse economic and social profiles, collaborative research requires significant technical \nexpertise and in-depth knowledge of the region and its countries. This is especially true if the \nissue at stake has broad social and cultural implications. Third, implementation of joint research \ntypically requires some type of preexisting relationships and partnerships, which are scarce in the \nresearch topics highlighted in para. 6 (i)\u2013(ii). Lastly, the technical capacity of research institutions \nin the region varies substantially, with some such institutions in developing economies lacking the \nresources to conduct joint RCI research. As a result, efforts to conduct research that identifies \ngood practices and innovative regional solutions to RCI themes tend to be carried out in a stand-\nalone or fragmented manner. Where collaboration exists, it tends to focus on sharing country-\nspecific analysis of a common topic but falls short of joint research that aims to provide regional \n                                                \n3  ADB. 2017.

The  situation  requires  proactive \npromotion of RCI-themed research partnerships across Asia and the Pacific. \n \n8.  ADB  is  addressing  the  challenge  by  building  general  networking  platforms  among \nresearch institutions. Through the implementation of TA for the Provision of Knowledge Products \nand Services to Developing Member Countries through Systematic Knowledge Sharing, ADB \nhelped  establish  the  ADB\u2013Asian  Think  Tanks  Network  (ATTN),  a  networking  platform  for \ngovernment-affiliated think tanks in Asia and the Pacific.6 Similarly, the Asian Development Bank \nInstitute (ADBI), in partnership with the Think Tanks and Civil Society Program of the University \nof Pennsylvania, hosts the Asia Think Tanks Secretariat, organizes the annual Asia Think Tank \nSummit, and maintains the Think Asia portal that serves more than 100 institutions. As the \nnetwork of think tanks strengthened, some think tanks expressed desire to do joint research work \nwith ADB on topics of mutual interest and to play a policy advisory role in the region. \n \n9.  A few initiatives to promote research on the regional agenda by forging collaboration \namong research institutions exist, but can be strengthened. Some institutions with regional \npresence have expressed interest for such an endeavor, including ADBI and the Association of \nPacific Rim Universities (APRU), which has a membership of 45 universities. The resulting policy-\nrelevant studies would benefit developing member countries, policy makers, and ADB\u2019s regional \ndepartments, as they could provide basis for regional solutions to cross-border issues. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: policy makers are provided with enhanced \nknowledge on emerging themes on RCI (footnote 2). Improved cooperation among research \ninstitutions helps enhance the quality and quantity of knowledge, which creates more and better-\ninformed policy makers and development practitioners who will prepare regional responses to \nRCI challenges. \n \n11.  The TA will have the following outcome: knowledge collaboration on selected RCI themes \namong policy research institutions in ADB member countries strengthened.7 Research institutions \nin Asia and the Pacific are expected to build networks and forge partnerships among themselves \nby taking part in joint RCI research, which offers opportunities to interact and share research \nideas, progress, and outcomes. These institutions will also gain experience in implementing \nregional collaborative research whose outputs will support a collective response to cross-border \nissues. Through policy dialogues under this TA, institutions not directly involved in research may \nalso benefit from stronger research capacities and networks. \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n12.  Output 1: Collaborative regional cooperation and integration research conducted. \nThe TA will facilitate the inception and implementation of two joint research initiatives on RCI \nthemes in collaboration with policy research institutions in the region. Each initiative will produce \nseveral papers analyzing the choice of RCI theme, with an aim to identify regional solutions and \n                                                \n6  ADB. Regional: Provision of Knowledge Products and Services to Developing Member Countries through Systematic \nKnowledge  Sharing.  https://www.adb.org/projects/46244-001/main;  and  ADB\u2013Asian  Think  Tanks  Network. \nhttp://www.adb-asianthinktanks.org. The TA team held five regional forums that provided a networking platform for \nthink tanks and opportunities to share knowledge on innovation, inclusive growth, urban planning, and infrastructure. \n7  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "4 \npolicy options. ADB and the APRU have identified two themes for research collaboration: (i) aging, \ndemographic changes, and labor mobility; and (ii) disaster risk-sharing mechanisms. The project \nteam  will  identify  the  details  of  the  research  themes  and  potential  partner  institutions  in \nconsultation with the organizations supporting regional research platforms, including the APRU \nand ADBI, prioritizing the issues discussed in regional forums such as ASEAN and Asia-Pacific \nEconomic  Cooperation.8 It  will  hold  one  inception  workshop  per  theme  for  key  research \ninstitutions  to  initiate  discussions  that  would  generate  innovative  research  concepts  and \nmethodologies that would take full advantage of the collaborators\u2019 expertise. For this workshop, \nthe project team will launch an open call for submissions of innovative research from scholars. \nADB will lead a group of experts in conducting an anonymous review to select papers for \npresentation. \n \n13.  The  project  team  is  anticipating  carrying  out  a  typical  joint  research  initiative  in \ncollaboration with multiple institutions in the region.9 Participating research institutions can be \ngovernment think tanks, public or private universities, or other research institutions that conduct \npolicy-relevant social and economic development research and have a proven track record of \nresearch activities in identified themes. ERCD and its Regional Cooperation and Integration \nDivision will also be part of the research team. \n \n14.  Output  2:  Developing  member  country  researchers  actively  participated  and \ndeepened knowledge on the research themes. Technical workshops will allow research \nprogress and draft research papers to be presented and evaluated by research project members \nand invited external experts, where needed. In addition, the project team will hold two high-level \npolicy forums to disseminate research findings and policy recommendations. It will collaborate \nwith the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation and ASEAN secretariats, Central Asia Regional \nEconomic Cooperation Institute, and other similar regional bodies in organizing dialogues to \nmaximize exposure and participation. The project team will make an effort to engage and \nencourage ATTN members to participate in research. \n \n15.  Output 3: Policy papers and book and/or report volume printed and disseminated. \nResearch papers and policy recommendations will be published as policy briefs and as an \nelectronic book and/or report. Electronic publication will be the primary channel of dissemination, \nbut some papers may be printed for targeted policy makers and institutions and disseminated \nbased on demand. These documents will be disseminated to a wider regional audience through \noutreach activities (at least one event per publication) and social media and will be made available \nthrough the websites of ADB, ADBI, APRU, and other participating research institutions. The \nproject team will maintain the ATTN website and use it as a platform for dissemination.10 Other \ndissemination activities will be tied to related ADB and ERCD events. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The TA budget is estimated to cost $500,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The key expenditure items are listed in \nAppendix 2. \n                                                \n8  The project team may consider running two parallel research initiatives simultaneously to maximize efforts to identify \ninnovative research and policy solutions. \n9  The project team could explore knowledge partnerships that are consistent with ADB\u2019s staff instructions (ADB. 2017. \nStaff Instruction on Business Processes for Knowledge Partnerships under Technical Assistance Operations. \nCompendium of Staff Instructions. Manila) if, in the process of implementation, such an arrangement would be more \nappropriate. \n10 The project team will enhance and update ATTN\u2019s existing website. \n ", "5 \nD. Implementation Arrangements\n17. ADB will administer the TA. ERCD will select, supervise, and evaluate consultants;\norganize workshops; and evaluate the accomplishment of outputs. On selected topics, ERCD will\nprovide staff to act as resource persons for the workshops. It will collaborate with research\ninstitutions in the region for joint research work in the chosen areas.\n18.
