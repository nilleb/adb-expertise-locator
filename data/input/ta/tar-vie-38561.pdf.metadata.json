Agricultural production \naccounts for 25% of gross domestic product and nearly 30% of exports. Of Viet Nam\u2019s total \npopulation, approximately 80% lives in rural areas. In addition, the agriculture sector hosts \nabout 75% of the workforce. Over the past decade, the agriculture sector has grown by 4\u20135% \nannually, and this has contributed to poverty reduction. From a food importing country in late \n1980s, Viet Nam has become the world\u2019s third largest rice exporter. The agriculture sector also \nexperienced significant production diversification. Managing risks associated with the agriculture \nsector, including production risk and market risk, is an important element in the Government\u2019s \noverall strategy to develop the sector and improve the welfare and livelihood of the rural \npopulation.  \n \n2.   The Government recognizes the importance of agricultural insurance and its potential \nimpact on income stabilization and ultimately poverty reduction. However, previous attempts to \nintroduce agricultural insurance products were not successful. The constraints and impediments \nto the provision of agricultural insurance need to be carefully examined. Policy options and \nsupport from the Government should also be considered, bearing in mind the experiences of \nother countries and the Government\u2019s current fiscal constraints. The Government has given \nagricultural insurance a high priority, in the wake of avian flu in 2004. Given the Government\u2019s \nlimited experience with agricultural insurance, the Government requested Asian Development \nBank (ADB) technical assistance (TA). In response to this request, a concept paper was \ndeveloped and endorsed for funding in the amount of $600,000 by the Poverty Reduction \nCooperation Fund in July 2004. An ADB fact-finding mission1 visited Hanoi from 4\u20139 October \n2004  and  reached  an  understanding  with  the  Government on the goals, purpose, scope, \nimplementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference for the \nproposed TA.2  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The primary activity of most rural households is agriculture. The risks faced by farmers \nare many, including weather-related shocks; volatile commodity prices; financial shocks, such \nas  devaluation;  and  negative  policy  changes.  Developed  countries  have  a  variety  of \ngovernment-supported  agriculture-related  insurance  services.  In  contrast,  in  developing \ncountries, including Viet Nam, rural residents generally rely on informal arrangements to help \nreduce risks. Such arrangements do not pool risks as efficiently as formal arrangements. The \nlack of efficient risk-mitigation mechanisms exposes farmers to the possibility of incidents where \nloss of income is substantial. Farmers in Viet Nam, as well as those in other developing \ncountries, need financially sustainable mechanisms to help them mitigate risks. Insurance is one \nof those mechanisms. \n \n4.  Developing agricultural insurance will have a direct impact on rural residents. From past \nexperiences, agricultural insurance fared poorly, at least in part because of problems related to \nmoral hazard and adverse selection resulting from asymmetric information. To control adverse \nselection and moral hazard requires better information, and information gathering is costly. \nRecently, to overcome these problems, innovations in agricultural insurance have emerged. \n                                                 \n1\n The mission comprised S. Lewis (mission leader, financial economist); M.A. De Alwis (senior financial economist); \nN.M. Huong (poverty reduction specialist); and B.T. Nghia (financial sector economist) and was assisted in the field \nby B. Philips (country director) and R. Adhikari (principal programs economist). \n2 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 15 September 2004. ", "2  \nWeather-related index insurance products are a few examples.3 These products offer new \nalternatives to the traditional crop insurance scheme. \n \n5.   In 2003, the Government approved a strategy for the development of the insurance \nmarket. The Government also supervises and monitors the insurance business in accordance \nwith the laws of Viet Nam and some international standards and practices. Since 1993, Viet \nNam\u2019s insurance sector has opened and undergone rapid growth and development. Prior to \n1993, only one insurance enterprise operated in Viet Nam, under a subsidy scheme. Four state-\nowned enterprises, 4 joint stock companies, 7 joint venture companies, 5 wholly foreign-owned \nenterprises, and 30 representative offices of foreign insurance entities now operate. Behind \npolicies to open the market, the insurance sector has realized robust growth. Total revenues \nfrom premiums of the entire market increased 29% per annum, on average, over the 1998\u20132003 \nperiod. Furthermore, the number of insurance products increased, which has helped businesses \nand residents become more familiar with the concept of insurance. \n \n6.  Basic insurance business legislation was developed and promulgated. The National \nAssembly approved the Law on Insurance Business in 2000, and the implementing decrees and \ncirculars were issued in 2001. The supervision, currently under the Insurance Department of the \nMinistry of Finance (MOF), is conducted based on objective financial and economic criteria, with \na focus on the solvency of insurance enterprises and safeguarding the legitimate rights and \nbenefits of insurance buyers. However, most insurance products available are for life and \nproperty insurance. In the insurance market, the Viet Nam Insurance Corporation (BAOVIET), a \nstate-owned insurance company, is the market leader, with revenue reaching more than $268 \nmillion in 2003. BAOVIET has 64 branches operating in all provinces of Viet Nam.  \n \n7.  In  1993,  BAOVIET  started  to  offer  rice  crop  insurance  policies  to  farmers  in  12 \nprovinces. However, from 1993 to 1998, the aggregate loss ratio, defined as indemnity paid to \nfarmers divided by total premiums received, was 110.00%, with significant fluctuations from \nprovince to province. Moreover, the actual area insured in this pilot project, compared to the \ntotal area of rice planted in the country, was only 1.16% in 1995 and 0.27% in 1997. The pilot \nproject apparently was not successful, due to inadequate participation of farmers, resulting in \nlow  premiums  received,  difficulty  in  risk  management,  and  inadequate  support  from  the \nGovernment, including that related to the policy and regulation-enabling environment. BAOVIET \nnow has a minor operation providing agricultural insurance. \n \n8.  Recently, as an initiative from a private firm, Viet Nam Groupama Insurance (VGI), a \nFrench insurance company, has started to offer livestock  insurance in 11 provinces in the \nsouthern part of Viet Nam. VGI is a wholly owned subsidiary of Groupama France, a company \nspecializing in agricultural insurance. In 2001, VGI was granted an operating license to provide \ninsurance to crop, livestock, and aquatic farmers. Its operation is mainly carried out in the \nMekong Delta. The company faced difficulties in the initial period of operation, given the low \nparticipation rate, great moral hazard, high claim ratio, and lack of information infrastructure. \n \n9.  Sustainable agricultural insurance in Viet Nam offers the potential for reducing the \nvulnerability of poor farmers in rural areas. Given the Government\u2019s strong support of the \ninsurance  sector  and  the  insurance  sector\u2019s  enabling  environment,  assistance  to  develop \nagricultural insurance is needed. \n \n                                                 \n3\n  Weather-related index insurance products make payments on the insurance policies based on weather events, \nsuch as temperature or rainfall. \n ", "   3\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n10.  The  purpose  of  the  TA  is  to  (i)  identify  impediments  to  developing  sustainable \nagricultural insurance in Viet Nam and propose policy options, (ii) provide feasible models for \ninformal agricultural risk mitigation and formal agricultural insurance for pilot testing, and (iii) \nconduct pilot testing of informal and formal risk mitigation models. The results of the TA will \nhave  potential  implications  on  the  design  of  the  agricultural  insurance  program  and  will \ncontribute to the Government\u2019s strategy to develop agricultural insurance in Viet Nam. Appendix \n1 gives the TA framework, and Appendix 2 contains the summary initial poverty and social \nanalysis. \n \n11.  The TA will have two phases. The first phase is an in-depth study and survey, which will \ncover 8 months. A comparative study of informal and formal risk management systems will be \nconducted.  The  consulting  team  will  review  and  assess  experiences  in  other  countries, \nparticularly less-developed countries, related to agricultural insurance. Weather-related index \ninsurance will be especially investigated. \n \n12.  Furthermore, a study of the specific needs for agricultural insurance products in Viet \nNam will be conducted to assess whether there exists sufficient demand for these products. The \nstudy will determine the major risks that farmers face, establish how farmers are currently \ncoping with risks, and ascertain products that might be useful for them. Information on informal \nrisk coping mechanisms, including farm and livestock management, and the importance of \nsavings and credit to manage risks will be obtained. In addition, affordability and willingness to \npay of poor farmers will be assessed. This study will be done through a survey, with appropriate \nsampling  methods  and  questionnaires,  and  results  will  be  rigorously  analyzed. \nRecommendations  for  agriculture-related  risk  prevention  will  be  stratified  according  to  the \nbeneficiaries\u2019 income level. The findings will be useful for designing appropriate insurance \nproducts that reduce the vulnerability of poor farmers.  \n \n13.  The  TA  will  identify  impediments  to  sustainable  agricultural  insurance  in  Viet  Nam, \nincluding legal framework, institutional capacity, and informational infrastructure, and propose \npolicy  options  for  providing  financially  viable  agricultural  insurance.  With  respect  to  crop \ninsurance, a feasibility study of a weather-related index insurance product will be conducted, \nwith assessment of formal regulations, informational infrastructure, detailed product design, and \nproposed  reinsurance.  Recommendations  from  the  TA  will  adhere  to  the  principles  of \ncommercial insurance. In addition, the issue of whether a government subsidy is justified will be \nanalyzed. The TA will also support capacity building in MOF\u2019s Department of Insurance. A pilot \nproject for weather-related index insurance will be designed, based on the results of the survey \nand other studies being done in the first phase. With respect to livestock insurance, the most \nfeasible way of insuring livestock will be investigated. To mitigate risks with regard to livestock, \nanother pilot project for informal risk coping mechanisms will be designed. Before the end of the \nfirst phase, ADB interdepartmental and Department for International Development reviews will \nbe conducted, to determine whether a case can be made for undertaking a pilot project. \n \n14.  The second phase is for pilot testing, which will cover 18 months. Two pilot projects are \nexpected. The first pilot project will test the appropriateness of the weather-related index \ninsurance product for crop insurance or any suitable alternative proposed in the first phase. The \nsecond pilot project will test a selected informal risk coping mechanism of the poor with regard \nto livestock. The training to raise awareness of participants on the concept of insurance and the ", "4  \nappropriate ways to manage their crops or the health of livestock will be one component of the \npilot  project.  Results  from  the  pilot  projects  will  be  rigorously  analyzed,  to  evaluate  the \neffectiveness of the pilot schemes, and recommendations will be proposed to the Government. \nLessons learned and evaluation results will also be disseminated to stakeholders. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n15.  The TA will fund consultants with expertise in agricultural insurance and microinsurance. \nA team of consultants will be recruited to work with counterpart staff members to accomplish \nrequired  deliverable  outputs.  Major  activities  will  include  reviewing  the  existing  market \nconditions of agricultural insurance in Viet Nam and pursuing in-depth consultations with public \nand private stakeholders to ensure that the proposed policy options are practical within the \nVietnamese economic and operational environment. Consultations with the private sector to \nassess the level of interest and major constraints and suggestions for improving regulatory \nframework  are  also  crucial.  Discussions  and  workshops  with  policy  makers,  government \nofficials, and other stakeholders will be held during TA implementation, to gather opinions, \ndisseminate information, and build consensus on the optimal approach for fostering agricultural \ninsurance in Viet Nam. The proposed TA will also fund study tours for officials involved in the \nimplementation of the agricultural insurance program in Viet Nam, and these tours are expected \nto occur in the second phase. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost a total of $750,000 equivalent, including a foreign exchange \ncost  of  $335,500  and  a  local  currency  cost  of  $414,500  equivalent.  A  total  of  $600,000 \nequivalent, including the entire foreign exchange cost and $264,500 equivalent of the local \ncurrency cost will be financed on a grant basis by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund, to \nbe administered by ADB. From the grant of $600,000, the amount of $120,000 is allocated for \nthe pilot projects, and the amount of $10,000 is allocated for study tours, which are activities \nexpected to occur in the second phase of the TA, provided that the approval to continue to the \nsecond phase is granted. The Government will contribute $150,000 equivalent in-kind for office \nspace,  counterpart  staff  members,  and  other  miscellaneous  services.  Details  of  the  cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  MOF will be the Executing Agency and responsible for the overall implementation of the \nTA. In addition to office space, MOF will provide counterpart staff members and other support \nservices to the consultants. A TA steering committee, which comprises representatives of \nBAOVIET,  MOF,  State  Bank  of  Viet  Nam,  Viet  Nam  Bank  for  Agriculture  and  Rural \nDevelopment and Viet Nam Farmers Union, will oversee TA implementation. MOF will appoint a \nproject officer for the purpose of assisting in daily TA implementation. During the TA inception \nmeeting, ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy will be explained.4 \n \n                                                 \n4 Attention will be drawn to the section on fraud and corruption that was added to ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement \nand Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, particularly the need for bidders, suppliers, contractors, and consultants \nto observe the highest standards of ethics in procuring and executing ADB-financed contracts, and the sanctions if \nfraud and corruption are discovered.  \n \n ", "   5\n18.  The TA will require 10 person-months of international and 14 person-months of domestic \nconsultant inputs. The terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 4. The TA will be \ncontracted to an international consulting firm. The contract with the consultants will be based on \nquality- and cost-based selection. Short-listed firms will submit simplified technical proposals. \nThe consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with the  Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants by Asian Development Bank and Its Borrowers and other arrangements satisfactory \nto ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. All procurement under the TA will be in \naccordance with ADB's Guidelines for Procurement. \n \n19.  In the second phase of the TA, one or two study tours will be organized by the \nconsultants  to  build  the  capacity  of  the  officials  concerned  in  the  implementation  of  the \nagricultural  insurance  program  in  Viet  Nam.  The  countries  for  study  tours  and  visits  to \ninstitutions will be carefully selected, considering their relevance to Viet Nam. The consultant \nteam will be responsible for making all necessary arrangements for the study tours. The \nparticipants will be required to submit to the consultant team and ADB reports of the study tours \nno later than 3 weeks after their return, citing the relevance of the study tours to their work. \n \n20.  The consultants will prepare detailed work plans (including a timetable for deliverables \ndefined under the TA, in consultation with MOF) before the start of the services. The consulting \nfirm is required to submit an inception report 2 weeks after commencing the Project. An interim \nreport will be submitted 8 weeks after the submission of the inception report and will be \nreviewed by MOF and ADB. A draft final report will be submitted within the deadline specified in \nthe work plan, after incorporating feedback from MOF and ADB. A tripartite meeting will be held \nbefore finalizing the draft final report. The final report, incorporating comments of MOF and ADB \nduring and after the tripartite meeting, will be submitted upon completion of service in the first \nphase. If a decision is made to continue the pilot testing in the second phase, both international \nconsultants  will  continue  to  provide  services  on  an  intermittent  basis  for  the  effective \nimplementation of the pilot projects. An evaluation report summarizing the results of the pilot \nprojects and recommendations will be submitted 1 month after completion of the pilot testing. \nThe TA is expected to be implemented over a period of 26 months, from April 2005 to May \n2007. \n \nIV.

Farmers face \nnumerous risks in agricultural production, and they use several mechanisms to cope with risks. Informal risk \nmitigating mechanisms of farmers will be investigated, and recommendations for replicating these mechanisms will \nbe suggested. For formal agricultural insurance in Viet Nam, previous efforts to provide agricultural insurance \nservices were unsuccessful. However, the Government recognized the importance of agricultural insurance and its \npotential effect on poverty reduction. The results from this technical assistance will contribute to the Government\u2019s \noverall strategy in insurance sector development and the design of an agricultural insurance program in Viet Nam.  \n \n B.  Poverty Analysis  Targeting Classification: General intervention  \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nThe technical assistance aims at reducing vulnerability and poverty of low-income people in the agriculture sector \nfacing production risk. Therefore, the assistance has a direct implication for poverty reduction. The successful \nimplementation of agricultural insurance products will help farmers manage risks and stabilize their incomes. Risk \ncoping mechanisms by self-help groups, if successfully replicated in larger areas, will contribute to risk reduction \nand income stabilization of farmers. Ultimately, these innovations in formal insurance and microinsurance are \nexpected to reduce vulnerability and poverty of farmers. \n \n \n C.
