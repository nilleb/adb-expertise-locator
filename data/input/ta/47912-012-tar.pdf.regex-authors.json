INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been active in supporting trade and trade \nfacilitation in its developing member countries (DMCs) through public sector and private sector \noperations. Providing assistance to promote trade-related capacity development in developing \ncountries is an integral part of promoting the future economic development and prosperity of \nADB's DMCs. The design and monitoring framework sets out how the proposed technical \nassistance (TA) will advance ADB\u2019s efforts to help DMCs integrate more fully into the world \ntrading system (Appendix 1).1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Trade is a highly effective tool to help developing countries boost economic growth and \ngenerate the resources necessary to reduce poverty. Trade (i) enhances a country's access to \ngoods, services, technologies, and knowledge; (ii) stimulates the entrepreneurial activities of the \nprivate sector; (iii) creates jobs and attracts private capital; (iv) fosters vital learning processes; \nand (v) increases foreign exchange earnings.     \n \n3.  In ADB's experience, some DMCs lack capacity to harness maximum benefits from \ninternational trade. Constraints to trade can be broadly categorized as relating to (i) trade policy \nand regulation; (ii) poor physical infrastructure; and (iii) trade development issues, including \naccess to trade finance and technology gaps. \n \n4.  An ADB study released in March 2013 identified a trade finance gap of $425 billion in \ndeveloping Asia.2 The survey-based study also revealed that access to more trade finance \ncould create 2% more production and result in 2% more jobs. Increasing access to trade finance \nis important to economic growth and job creation. \n \n5.  A key cause of lack of development of trade finance is because many banks in DMCs \nstruggle to establish and/or maintain correspondent banking relationships with international \nbanks, which are needed to access liquidity and guarantees in support of trade. While some \nfactors (e.g., political and macroeconomic instability) are beyond their control, banks in DMCs \noften lack financial and technical capacities, which inhibit potential international correspondent \nbanks from establishing credit lines to support trade. As a result, less financial support is \navailable for companies in DMCs engaged in importing and exporting of goods and services. \nThis reduces the availability and increases the cost of trade finance in many least developed \ncountries, hindering their full participation in international trade. \n \n6.  ADB has previously supported development of trade finance through two TA projects, \nwhose implementation started in 2009 and 2013.3 The consultants engaged under these two \nprojects successfully conducted in-depth credit analysis on over 100 banks in DMCs which \nenabled ADB to establish credit limits on banks that underpinned the exponential growth of the \nTFP and its related development impact and mobilization of most of ADB\u2019s commercial co-\nfinancing. Under these projects, knowledge sharing seminars were also conducted in Armenia, \nAzerbaijan, Mongolia, Myanmar, Nepal, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. Currently, ADB\u2019s Trade \nFinance Program (TFP) involves over 125 international banks and 100 banks in DMCs. These \n                                                \n1 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 17 January 2014. \n2 ADB. 2013. Asian Development Bank Trade Finance Survey: Major Findings. ADB Briefs No. 11. Manila. \n3 ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance for Trade Finance Capacity Development. Manila (TA 7264-REG); ADB. 2013. \nTechnical Assistance for Trade Finance Capacity Development, Phase II. Manila (TA 8323-REG). \n ", "2   \n100  banks  are  located  in  the  following  19  DMCs:  Afghanistan,  Armenia,  Azerbaijan, \nBangladesh,  Bhutan,  Cambodia,  Georgia,  Indonesia,  Kazakhstan,  the  Kyrgyz  Republic, \nMongolia, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and \nViet Nam.  TFP was unable to effect its 2013 plan to expand to countries in the pacific, namely, \nTimor Leste, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, and Samoa, due to lack of budget and human resources.    \n   \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n7.  The proposed TA is linked closely to the operations of the TFP, and is designed to \ncomplement the TFP\u2019s development impact, operations, and expansion.  The proposed TA will \nbuild on the ongoing work under the TA projects started in 2009 and 2013 by  assessing \ncapacity constraints in banks and banking systems in DMCs, by analyzing banks and their \ncapacity to participate in the TFP, either for the first time or on an ongoing basis through annual \nreviews and by providing training to banks to improve their capacity to provide trade finance to \ncompanies, including many SMEs. The proposed TA will continue to benefit current partner \nbanks in TFP in the form of monitoring and knowledge sharing. The proposed TA will benefit \nnew banks in the new markets TFP plans to expand into in 2014 and beyond through monitoring \nand trade finance capacity building for these banks. \n \n8.  The TA supports and is complementary to ADB's public operations in trade and trade \nfacilitation projects.  It is linked to the Financial Sector Operational Plan as well as a number of \nthe  strategies  and  business  opportunities  presented  in  country  strategy  papers,  regional \ncooperation strategy and programs, and country operations business plans for ADB's DMCs.  A \nreview of these documents underscores the importance of trade finance capacity development \nin DMCs to enable ADB to meet its development objectives. An overview of some of the specific \ncountry and regional strategies and business plans with direct links to the TA is provided in a \nsupplementary appendix.  \n   \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact of the TA will be higher levels of intraregional trade and higher levels of trade \nbetween DMCs. The outcome of the TA will be enhanced trade finance capacity in DMCs.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA  outputs  and key  activities  are  linked to the  operation  and  potential further \nexpansion of the TFP. This TA will also benefit new banks in the TFP\u2019s target countries, which \ninclude Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Timor-Leste, and Vanuatu.4 The TA will have the \nfollowing outputs. \n \n1.  Knowledge Building in Developing Member Countries   \n \na.  Bank Assessments and Capacity Building   \n \n11.  The  TA  will  conduct  approximately  10  new  bank  assessments  and  over  80  bank \nmonitoring assessments from March 2014 to February 2015, enabling ADB to undertake due \ndiligence on banks to identify and characterize any gaps in the financial and technical capacity \n                                                \n4  Target countries may change depending on market demand and conditions. \n ", "  3 \nof individual banks that would inhibit the provision and/or increase of trade finance credit lines.5 \nResults of this due diligence will be contained in credit applications to establish or maintain TFP \ncredit lines for participating banks. Information derived from the TA will benefit the banks by \nidentifying where they lack capacity, and it will enable ADB to provide capacity development to \nbanks and specific banking systems in DMCs.  \n \n12.  The periodic bank monitoring assessments (annual reviews) are based on the principle \nof repeat engagement over the medium and long term for effective capacity building. ADB will \nconduct yearly financial assessments (and/or quarterly covenant reviews). As ADB assumes \nrisk  on  the  vast  majority  of  these  banks  through  the  TFP,  ongoing  assessments  (annual \nreviews) and monitoring are required to ensure ADB continues to assume reasonable risks.  \n \n13.  The TA activities will include the following:   \n \n(i)  work with individual banks to acquire financial data;  \n(ii)  analyze the financial information through financial, ratio, gap, and other analyses; \n(iii)  conduct due diligence on banks through (a) holding meetings with banks; (b) \nassessing corporate governance, anti-money-laundering policies, and \nmanagement capabilities; and (c) asking the banks questions related to financial \nanalysis; \n(iv)  assess the trade finance operations capacity for selected banks and make \nrecommendations for improvement; \n(v)  draft credit applications to be submitted to the TFP;  \n(vi)  conduct a banking sector analysis for each DMC; \n(vii)  conduct signing ceremonies with new partner banks; and \n(viii)  deliver trade finance training. \n \nb.  Knowledge Dissemination and Training Seminars \n \n14.  Information  on  where  individual  banks  lack  finance  and  technical  capacity  will  be \nconveyed directly to those banks on a confidential basis. In addition, the TA proposes to \ndisseminate more general information about trade finance operations and provide trade finance \ntraining to a larger audience within DMCs through in-country seminars to which DMC banks, \nexporters, government officials, and international banks may be invited if appropriate.  \n \n15.  ADB plans to conduct a total of two seminars over the course of the TA. The knowledge \ndissemination and/or training seminar could cover the following areas: \n \n(i)  key concepts and processes in trade finance; \n(ii)  benefits to banks from trade finance services; \n(iii)  essentials to develop and market trade finance products and services; \n(iv)  payment and risk categories; \n(v)  risk analysis of trade finance products; \n(vi)  fundamentals of documentary credits; \n(vii)  types of letter of credit and standby credit; \n(viii)  types of bonds and guarantees; and  \n(ix)  receivables and supply chain financing. \n \n                                                \n5  The TA will coordinate with the TFP to target banks where there is market demand for capacity development. \n ", "4   \n2.  Partnership Development \n \n16.  ADB will approve TFP credit lines to DMC banks following financial analysis and due \ndiligence. These credit lines will continue to provide international banks with guarantees that will \nleverage existing available limits between international banks and banks in DMCs to support \ntrade.  The  capacity  assessments  undertaken  by  the  TA  will  underpin  the  formation  and \nmaintenance of partnerships between DMC and international banks. \n \n17.  Similarly, as the TFP guarantees and funds trade transactions (through banks) between \nimporters and exporters, the work financed through the TA will foster partnerships between \nimporting and exporting companies.  \n \n18.  The TFP attracts approximately $2 billion in cofinancing every year. Bank monitoring \nassessments from the previous TA projects have been shared with major cofinancing partners \n(e.g., insurers and export credit agencies) (footnote 3).  As such, these previous TA projects \nhave been important to attract cofinancing and private sector investment to DMCs to support \ntrade. \n \n19.  The TFP expansion plans cover a multiyear period. Table 1 provides a summary of the \nassessments  and  seminars  delivered  for  2009\u20132013  under  the  previous  TA  projects  and \nexpected deliverables in 2014\u20132015 under this proposed TA.  \n \nTable 1: Deliverables for Trade Finance Capacity Development Technical Assistance \nPhase 1 and Phase 2 \n \n  Actual  Projected  Proposed TA \n  Aug 2009\u2013  Mar 2013\u2013  Mar 2014\u2013 \nItem  Feb 2013  Feb 2014  Feb 2015 \nNew bank assessments  86  15      10a \nBank monitoring assessments  258  100  80 \nCountry risk and banking system assessments  54  19  24 \nSeminars  5  2  2 \nTA = technical assistance. \na  The number of new bank assessments will depend on the TFP acquiring more staff to accommodate and manage TFP \nexpansion to the Pacific region.   \nSource: Trade Finance Program, Private Sector Financial Institutions Division, Asian Development Bank. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n20.  The TA is estimated to cost $3 million, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The funds will cover remuneration, travel, and per \ndiem  for  international  consultants;  conference-related  expenditures;  and  miscellaneous \nexpenses. A detailed cost breakdown and proposed financing plan are presented in Appendix 2. \n   \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n21.  The  TA  will  require  about  132  person-months  of  consulting  inputs.  Recruitment  of \nconsultants will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as \namended from time to time). ADB will engage a firm specializing in financial analysis and due \ndiligence for emerging market banks, using quality and cost-based selection. In addition to \nconducting due diligence, drafting credit applications, monitoring risk, and administering the \nprogram, consultants and resource persons may be engaged by ADB to conduct seminars or \n ", "  5 \ntraining.  Terms  of  reference  for  the  consultants  are  provided  in  Appendix 3.  Equipment \n(smartphones) will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as \namended from time to time) and will be retained by ADB following TA completion. \n \n22.  ADB will be the executing agency while the Private Sector Operations Department will \nadminister and implement the TA. Disbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with \nADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \nThe TA will be implemented from March 2014 to February 2015. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION  \n23.  The President recommends that the Board approve the provision of technical assistance \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $3,000,000 on a grant basis for Capacity Development for \nBanks in Developing Member Countries under the Trade Finance Program.  \n \n \n \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets  Data Sources and \nand Indicators with  Reporting  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nHigher levels of  Increase in intraregional  TFP statistics as  Perception of risk in \nintraregional trade  trade transactions to at  provided at  DMCs remains a \n  least 4,000 by 2015  www.adb.org/tfp and  concern to the private \n  (baseline = 1,801 in  triennial reviews  sector, increasing \n  2012)  demand for the TFP. \n     \nHigher levels of trade  Increase in bilateral  Continued government \nbetween DMCs  trade between DMCs to  support for trade finance \n3,190 transactions by  and trade \n2015 (baseline = 1,370   \ntransactions in 2012)  Risk \n \nLong-term subdued \ngrowth of world \neconomy \n \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \nEnhanced trade finance  Increased government  TFP statistics as  Continuing interest by \ncapacity in DMCs.  awareness of trade  provided at  DMC banks in \nfinance issues affecting  www.adb.org/tfp and  enhancing their capacity \ncommercial banks by  triennial reviews   for trade finance \nJune 2016.     \n  Feedback and  Governments remain \nThe number of trade  discussion at ADB  committed to facilitating \ntransactions supported  seminars and from  trade \nunder the TFP  commercial banks   \nincreasing to at least  Continued access to \n7,000 by February 2015  trade finance \n(baseline = 3,029 in   \n2012)  Risk \n   \nThe number of SMEs  Newly imposed export \nsupported under the  and import restrictions \nTFP increasing to 2,800  prevent growth in trade. \nby February 2015   \n(baseline = 1,208 in \n2012) \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.

A reputable consultancy firm will be hired to undertake technical assistance (TA) in the \nform of financial analysis, including annual reviews, of approximately 100 banks every year in  \nemerging Asian countries, including Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, \nCambodia, Georgia, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, Myanmar, Nepal, \nPakistan, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Viet Nam. \n \n2.  This work will be part of Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) Trade Finance Program \n(TFP). TFP fills private sector market gaps for trade finance by providing guarantees and loans \nthrough banks in the most challenging Asian markets, where gaps are proportionally largest. \nJust  within  2012, TFP supported  $4  billion  in  trade  through  over  2,000  transactions. TFP \nassumes risk on banks to support trade, hence its ongoing analysis, supported by this TA, and \nengagement with obligor banks is critical to operations. TFP has never had a default or a loss.1  \n \nA.  Objective and/or Purpose of Assignment  \n \n3.   The TA will support ADB\u2019s TFP in assessing its risk on obligor banks on an ongoing \nbasis while increasing the capacity of developing member countries (DMCs) of the ADB to \nattract and retain trade finance credit lines from the private sector. This is achieved primarily \nthrough financial analysis and due diligence of DMC banks. The TA will also deliver a few \nseminars  in-country  to  disseminate  information  about  what  has  been  learned  through  the \nanalysis and due diligence process. This information will be valuable for DMC banks and \nregulators to seek improvements in their banking sector which will, among other benefits, help \nto attract more trade finance lines from TFP and international banks and investors. \n \n4.   This assignment is designed to (i) conduct financial analysis and due diligence on \npotential  partner  banks  in  the  TFP  and  annual  reviews  of  existing  TFP  partner  banks  to \ndetermine if DMC banks are suitable for (ongoing) participation in the TFP; (ii) identify capacity \ngaps that impede DMC banks from maintaining and accessing trade finance credit lines from \nADB and international banks and/or investors; (iii) through the lead consultant, coordinate field \nwork with the TFP to ensure that all required banks and countries are visited and analyzed \nwithin specified annual review periods; and (iv) conduct knowledge-sharing seminars to wider \naudiences in DMCs. \n \nB.  Required Inputs \n \n1.  Team  Leader  (international  bank  financial  analysis  expert,  12  person-\nmonths) \n \n5.  Scope of work.
