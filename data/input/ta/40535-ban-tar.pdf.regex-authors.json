INTRODUCTION \n1.  The loan for the Second Command Area Development Project1 is included in the country \noperations business plan 2008\u20132010 for Bangladesh.2 A technical assistance project3 provided \nby the Asian Development Bank (ADB) prepared an investment project that will enhance food \nsecurity and rural incomes by improving the productivity of selected major irrigation systems and \nsupport to bringing the National Water Policy into operation. During project preparation, the \nfollowing major constraints to the efficient performance of these systems were identified: (i) the \nlimited capacity of public agencies in effective management and operation and maintenance \n(O&M) of large irrigation schemes, and (ii) inadequate O&M planning and funding mechanisms \nthat result in chronic system deterioration. To address these, it is proposed to reform irrigation \nservice  delivery  by  introducing  public\u2013private  partnerships  (PPP)  and  performance-based \nservice agreements for the management and O&M of major irrigation systems, and establish \ntransparent performance monitoring and evaluation systems that will allow rapid feedback and \ncorrective measures. An ADB fact-finding mission was fielded in September 2008 to consult \nwith  the  Government  and  agree  on  the  outcome,  outputs,  activities,  cost,  financing  and \nimplementation arrangements, and terms of reference of a capacity development technical \nassistance  project\u2014Developing  Innovative  Approaches  to  Management  of  Major  Irrigation \nSystems.4 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  About  44%  of  Bangladesh's  poor  people  live  in  rural  areas  with  low  agricultural \nproductivity and unreliable food supplies. Therefore, promoting agricultural growth is a critical \nelement of the Government\u2019s strategy aimed at food security and poverty reduction. Efficient \nand sustainable irrigation systems are central to boosting agricultural productivity and improving \nrural livelihoods.  \n3.  Water Management and Food Security. Bangladesh has a net cultivable area of about \n8  million  hectares  (ha),  with  currently  about  4.5  million  ha  irrigated.  The  irrigated  area \ncontributes an estimated 13 million tons (t) of cereals (mainly rice). While about 90% of this \nirrigated area is provided by the private sector, mainly from groundwater with minimal public \nsector financing, the National Water Management Plan (NWMP) recognizes that the area that \ncan be irrigated by groundwater in the future is limited to a further 1 million ha, which can \ncontribute an added 5 million t to food production. At current consumption rates, this would feed \nan additional population of around 30 million people, the estimated increase in population over \n15 years.5 The NWMP also acknowledges the low irrigation intensities and productivity of the \nexisting major surface water schemes and, because of the pressing need to increase food \nproduction and rural incomes, suggests urgently enhancing the performance of these schemes \nby rehabilitating water management infrastructure and improving management and O&M. This \nrepresents a sound strategy given the cost effectiveness and rapid impact of investments.  \n4.  Deterioration of infrastructure leads to a reduced irrigated area and insufficient supply of \nirrigation water, resulting in low yields and reduced farm production, household incomes, and \ndemand for labor. Failure to rehabilitate infrastructure and properly manage and maintain the \n                                                 \n1  To better reflect the design, impact, and outcome of the loan Project, the project title was changed to Enhancing \nthe Performance of Major Water Management Systems Project. \n2  ADB. 2007. Country Operations Business Plan Bangladesh 2008\u20132010. Manila. The sum of $50 million from the \nAsian Development Fund has been allocated for the loan scheduled for approval in 2010.  \n3  ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for Preparing the Second Command \nArea Development Project. Manila. \n4  The technical assistance first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 8 October 2008. \n5  By 2050, the population is forecast to increase to 230 million from the current 135 million. \n ", "2   \nlarge-scale surface water schemes also has direct negative impacts on food production and \npoverty. Successful infrastructure rehabilitation will also bring substantial social benefits as a \nresult of increased farm and rural incomes. The need for efficient O&M is established and \nindicates the high costs to communities and the national economy as a whole of failing to \nadequately finance and implement O&M.6 Finally, there is an urgent need to improve scheme \nperformance by replacing the current management system that lacks (i) transparent service \nagreements incorporating recipient feedback needed for accountable service delivery, (ii) the \nskill mix required to efficiently manage the system with adequate participation by water users,  \n(iii) performance-oriented organizations that can provide cost-effective system management, \nand (iv) sound monitoring and management information systems that are needed to improve \nirrigation  management  and  to  ensure  effective  system  performance  based  on  scientific \nperformance standards and continuous feedback from water users.  \n5.  Policy Framework. In 1999, the Government declared a national water policy that aims \nto redress management and institutional-related performance problems associated with large-\nscale surface water schemes. The policy directs that these schemes \u201cwill be gradually placed \nunder private management through leasing, concession, or management contracts under open \nbidding procedures, or jointly managed by the project implementation agency along with local \ngovernment and community organizations.\u201d7 This directive is reinforced in the NWMP, which \nstates that \u201c...existing and new schemes over 5,000 ha will be progressively transferred to \nautonomous operating authorities\u2026\u201d The policy further emphasizes stakeholders\u2019 participation \nin  the  planning  design,  construction,  and  O&M  of  these  schemes.  The  National  Poverty \nReduction Strategy, formulated in 2005, emphasizes agriculture and rural development for jobs, \nfood security, and sustainable livelihood opportunities for the rural poor. The strategy also \nhighlights  water  resource  management  as  a  priority  for  targeted  pro-poor  growth  in  its \noverarching goal of a 50% reduction in poverty by 2015. While the long-term aims of the policy \nmatrix are clear, the short-term steps are less so and, as a result, progress in regard to large-\nscale schemes has been limited.  \n6.  ADB Support. ADB supports the Government\u2019s efforts to (i) expand access to irrigation; \n(ii) decentralize irrigation system planning, implementation, and management; and (iii) foster \nsustainable O&M by encouraging stakeholder empowerment and efficient public investment in \nlarge  (i.e.,  command)  and  small-scale  water  management  schemes.  ADB  also  provides \nassistance for the implementation of the National Water Policy and NWMP, both encompassing \nkey principles of integrated water resource management, sustainable service delivery, and \nactive user participation in water management. \n7.  Lessons. Several major initiatives in the irrigation subsector are ongoing.8 The recently \ncompleted Command Area Development Project9 provided the following lessons that have been \n                                                 \n6 The Government has gradually increased O&M funds from $10.0 million in 2001 to $24.0 million in 2005. A further \nincrease of about 15% was introduced in 2007. However, the pace of institutional change in the underresourced \nwater management organizations remains slow.  \n7   Government of Bangladesh. 1999. National Water Policy. Dhaka. \n8  ADB. 1995.

The ongoing Second Small Scale Water Resources Development Sector Project,10 \nfunded by ADB and the Government of the Netherlands, involves stakeholder-driven planning, \ndesign, implementation, and O&M of water management schemes with command areas of less \nthan 1,000 ha. The Water Management Improvement Project, financed by the International \nDevelopment  Association  and  the  Government  of  the  Netherlands,  supports  system \nimprovement, management transfer, and improved O&M of medium-scale (1,000 ha\u20135,000 ha) \nschemes, and addresses institutional weaknesses within the Bangladesh Water Development \nBoard (BWDB). The Government of the Netherlands also finances the Integrated Planning for \nSustainable Water Management Project that focuses on promoting integrated and participatory \nrehabilitation of medium-scale water management schemes. The governments of Bangladesh \nand the Netherlands support the strengthening of the BWDB and the Water Resources Planning \nOrganization management through a joint project.  \n8.  These investments also provide a number of lessons: (i) project planning needs to reflect \ndiverse stakeholder interests; (ii) beneficiaries need to be involved from the early stages of the \nproject cycle through O&M; (iii) careful monitoring of scheme performance is required since \nO&M management and funding remain weak; and (iv) finalization of the BWDB\u2019s institutional \nstrategy  is  needed  to  strengthen  its  resources,  capacity,  and  commitment  to  beneficiary \nparticipation along with the poverty and social agenda.  \n9.  Within this context, the Government requested support from ADB to improve system \nperformance and productivity of selected major water management schemes under the Second \nCommand  Area  Development  Project  (footnote  1).  The  Project  will  put  into  operation  key \nGovernment directives in the water sector by introducing PPP models in the management and \nO&M of large-scale irrigation systems, and through physical rehabilitation. The loan Project will \ncomprise the following parts: (i) enhanced water management including participatory project \nplanning,  rehabilitation  of  priority  infrastructure,  and  introduction  of  effective  system \nmanagement  and  O&M;  (ii)  support  for  sustainable  livelihood  encompassing  agricultural \nservices, fisheries development, and pro-poor income-generating activities; and (iii) effective \nproject management and water management institutions. The impact of the Project will be \nsustainable livelihoods improvement and reduced poverty in the project areas. The outcome of \nthe Project is the realization of the full production potential of the selected schemes through \nimproved water management, upgraded infrastructure, and efficient O&M. ADB\u2019s safeguard \npolicies have been addressed through initial environmental examinations, resettlement plans, a \nresettlement framework, a social development strategy, and a gender action plan.11  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n10.  During the project preparatory TA (footnote 3), the following major constraints to the \nsustainable performance of large irrigation systems were identified and need to be addressed: \n(i)  the  limited  experience  of  the  BWDB  in  effective  management  and  O&M  of  large-scale \nschemes; (ii) a skill mix within the BWDB that is not appropriate to efficiently plan, implement, \n                                                                                                                                                          \n9  Loan 1399-BAN for SDR20.4 million  was approved in 1996. The objective of the project was to increase \nagricultural  production  within  the  Meghna-Dhonagoda  Irrigation  Project  and  Pabna  Irrigation  and  Rural \nDevelopment Project through system rehabilitation and on-farm development. \n10 ADB. 2001.

In  order  to  reform  irrigation  service  delivery,  improve  the  sustainability  and \nimplementation  effectiveness  of  the  ensuing  loan  project,  and  further  support  the \nimplementation  of  Government  strategies  in  the  water  sector,  this  TA  project  will  be \nimplemented. The TA will (i) assess existing O&M planning, financing and implementation \nprocedures,  policy  framework,  institutional  setup,  and  capacities;  (ii)  propose  new  service \nagreements and alternative management models, including PPPs and independent service \nproviders  that  would  manage  and  operate  the  systems  (e.g.,  private  sector  operators, \nautonomous  authorities,  nongovernment  organizations  [NGOs],  contractors,  and  joint \nmanagement by local government institutions); (iii) propose alternative financing arrangements \nto make up the difference between the O&M requirements and the available funding; and       \n(iv) develop new models for O&M and performance monitoring. \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The impact of the TA will be support to bringing the National Water Policy into operation \nand implementing the NWMP and the Guidelines for Participatory Water Management in order \nto enhance the performance of major irrigation systems. The TA outcome will be effective and \nsustainable implementation of the ensuing loan project (Enhancing the Performance of Major \nWater Management Systems) with active participation of beneficiaries, private sector operators, \nand  local  government  institutions.  The  TA  and  the  loan  project  will  contribute  to  the \nimplementation of the Government\u2019s strategy for poverty reduction through improved service \ndelivery and water resources management resulting in increased agricultural production. The \nspecific outputs will comprise (i) regulatory and institutional measures for participatory O&M \nplanning  and  implementation;  (ii)  models  for  effective  O&M  planning,  implementation,  and \nfunding by beneficiaries and the Government; (iii) innovative mechanisms for irrigation service \ndelivery, efficient management, and O&M of large irrigation systems; and (iv) detailed project \nimplementation and management arrangements. It is anticipated that these new management \nconcepts will be replicated throughout Bangladesh and in the region.  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities   \n13.  In collaboration with the BWDB, the TA will (i) assess the existing O&M planning and \nfinancing procedures, institutional setup, and capacities; (ii) propose alternative service delivery \nagreements and management arrangements, including full participation of beneficiaries, PPPs, \nand independent entities that would manage and operate the systems (e.g., private sector \noperators, autonomous authorities, NGOs,12 civil contractors, and joint management by local \ngovernment institutions); (iii) propose alternative and transparent O&M financing arrangements \nto make up the difference between the actual O&M requirements and the currently available \nfunding; (iv) propose new arrangements for O&M planning, implementation, and participatory \nperformance monitoring, taking account of the legal implications and contractual and financial \nrisks; (v) assess the financial and economic impacts of the proposed management and O&M \nmodels at farm, project, and national level; (vi) propose systems for performance benchmarking \nof the irrigation service providers, and a participatory system for monitoring and evaluation;     \n(vii) develop an exit strategy that will be implemented after the completion of the loan Project; \nand (viii) propose a high-level project supervisory body that will include key stakeholders (e.g., \nwater users, water management organizations, local government institutions, civil society, and \n                                                 \n12  During the implementation of the loan project, NGOs will be also involved in the mobilization of beneficiaries, \nresettlement, support to and capacity building of water management groups, and implementation of agriculture and \nincome-generation programs. \n ", "  5 \nthe private sector). Lessons from ADB operations, experiences of other funding agencies, and \nbest international practices will be incorporated into the outputs of the TA.13  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $880,000 equivalent. ADB\u2019s technical assistance \nfunding program will finance $750,000 equivalent. The Government will fund the remaining \n$130,000 equivalent through provision of office space, counterpart staff, surveys, data collection, \nand analysis. Specific cost estimates and a financing plan are provided in Appendix 2.  \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The TA will be implemented over 7 months from August 2009 to February 2010.

Performance  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  The  TA  will  develop  a  performance \ncategorization (ranking) format for water management projects, transparent and participatory \nperformance  monitoring  and  evaluation  systems  for  the  two  subprojects,  and  systems  for \nperformance  benchmarking  of  the  irrigation  service  providers  and  participatory  system \nmonitoring and evaluation.6 The TA will also assess the financial and economic impacts of the \nproposed farm, project, and national management and O&M models and propose indicators and \nsystems for future monitoring and evaluation. These proposals will also include indicators for the \nperformance of the system\u2014including headworks; main, secondary, and tertiary systems; and \nO&M\u2014and will allow feedback from water users and key stakeholders. These monitoring and \nevaluation systems will be linked to the implementation structures and performance-based \ncontracts that will be used for the planning, implementation, management, and O&M of the two \nsubprojects. Finally, the TA team will develop an exit strategy that will be implemented after the \ncompletion of the loan Project and the withdrawal of the external O&M financing. \n12.
