In September 2001, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved its Social Protection \nStrategy covering five areas identified by ADB as main target areas of social protection: (i) labor \nmarkets, (ii) social insurance, (iii) social assistance, (iv) micro-insurance schemes, and (v) child \nprotection. The Government of Pakistan\u2019s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) gives high \npriority to improving social protection. ADB is assisting the Government in various areas of \nsocial protection, including early childhood development,  health,  and  education. Under the \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction, ADB is also supporting a pilot project to improve the health \nand nutrition status of marginalized women and children.1 \n \n2.  ADB\u2019s Country Strategy Program (CSP) for Pakistan (2002-2004), includes a social \nprotection  study  in  2003  for  $350,000  to  identify  the  scope  and  strategies  for  (i)  social \nprotection, and (ii) specifically for health insurance.2 For 2006, the CSP (2004-2006) foresees a \nloan project on social health insurance. \n \n3.  ADB conducted a Fact-finding Mission from 9\u201323 May 2003. The Mission reached an \nunderstanding  with  the  Government  on  the  objectives,  scope,  financing,  implementation \narrangements, and terms of reference of the study. The technical assistance (TA) framework is \nshown in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  With a population of 143 million growing at a rate of 2.4% per year, Pakistan is ranked \n138  of  173  countries  covered  by  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme  Human \nDevelopment  Index.  It  falls  under  the  category  \"low  human  development.\" It is generally \naccepted that the declining trend in poverty during the 1970s and 1980s was reversed in the \n1990s. The incidence of poverty increased from 26.6% in 1993 to 32.1% in 2000, during which \nperiod the number of poor increased by over 12 million. Since 1999, economic growth has \nslowed  further,  development  spending  has  continued  to  decline,  and  the  country  has \nexperienced a severe drought. It is therefore highly likely that the incidence of poverty today is \nsignificantly higher than in 1999.3 \n \n5.  Poverty rose more sharply in the rural areas in the 1990s, and in 1999 the incidence of \nrural poverty (36.3%) was significantly higher than that of urban poverty (22.6%). Inequality also \nincreased in all four provinces. In 1997, the income share of the bottom 20% of households had \ndeclined to 6.9%, from 7.9% in 1987, and the income share of the bottom 40% of households \nhad declined from 20% to 18%. \n \n6.  Apart from poverty, vulnerability is of importance when discussing the issues related to \nsocial protection. Vulnerability is the risk of falling below the poverty line. In Pakistan, in addition \nto those mentioned above, who live below the poverty line, large numbers of people, due to their \nvulnerability, face the risk of becoming poor or face transitory poverty. \n \n7.  Even though there is a large need, social protection is very limited in Pakistan. This \ncounts for all the five areas of social protection identified by the ADB Social Protection Strategy. \nThere is no general or universal social protection in Pakistan. However, a number of initiatives \naimed at helping the poor (by improving governance and functioning public sector institutions; \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2003.

Manila. \n ", "2 \n \ncreating assets, employment, and income generation opportunities; revamping social safety net \nsystems; and improving access to basic services) are being implemented. The schemes are run  \nby the Government, and also by nongovernment organizations (NGOs) and the private sector. \n \n8.  At present, the formal social security systems are restricted to groups like civil servants, \narmy, police, as well as some formal sector enterprises (with five or more employees). Formal \nsector social security provisions include (i) the provincially based Employees' Social Security \nSystem, (ii) the Employees' Old Age Benefits Institution, and (iii) the Workers Welfare Fund. \nNone of these schemes covers workers from the agriculture sector, the informal economy, or \nthose in formal sector who are temporarily employed or employed in establishments with fewer \nthan five employees. The coverage of these schemes is less than 3% of the total employed \nlabor  force.  There  are  hardly  any  informal,  traditional,  community-based  insurance \narrangements (for example micro-insurance). There is also a gender and rural-urban bias in \nexisting social protection schemes. \n \n9.  The Government has, over the years, undertaken several public works programs to \ncreate assets and employment opportunities for the poor. The most recent, the Khushhal \nPakistan Program, is an integrated small public works program. There are other social welfare \narrangements for certain groups. Among the existing social safety nets are the Zakat Fund, the \nBaut-ul-Maal, as well as the Food Support Program and many NGOs, which are giving support \nto the poor. But still most people lack protection from all major life risks, including ill health, \ndeath, disability, old age, unemployment, and natural disasters. \n \n10.  Some ongoing projects and activities, financed mainly by international donors, have a \nlink to social protection. In the field of health insurance, the World Bank is funding a small pilot \nproject  in  North-West  Frontier  Province.  The  United  States  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment has funded a report on Policy Options for Financing Health Services in Pakistan, \nand the International Labour Organization is implementing a series of TAs. One planned project \nthat will have significant relevance for the present study is Social Protection in Pakistan for \nPoverty Reduction under the Decent Work Program, which will review policy recommendations \nfor social protection, especially reform of pension schemes and occupational health and safety \nsystems.  \n \n11.   However, the existing social protection schemes and activities remain scattered, and \ncoverage is low. While these activities bring benefits to certain population groups, they rarely \ncontribute to strategic change unless they are linked to policy development. There is also a \nneed to strengthen the existing services from public and private sources. Capacity building will \nhelp to make sure that there are no leakages and that funds entirely reach the poor. Hence, this \nwould be very important as a basis for the development of a social protection strategy for the \ncountry.  \n \n12.  Major health incidents, especially those of catastrophic dimensions, may aggravate the \npoverty of private households or may even lead to bankruptcy of families. \"The development of \nthe private health sector is also constrained by the low level of development of the health \ninsurance industry. The lack of access to health insurance poses a major problem for the \nfinancing of care for catastrophic episodes of illness and injuries.\"4 Risk pooling, for example \nthrough health insurance, may prevent households from falling into poverty, and those who are \nalready poor will have the chance to get access to better health services. Health insurance thus \nmakes a major contribution to poverty reduction and prevention. Even in cases where health \ninsurance does not pay for services, it can provide a service to customers through negotiation of \n                                                 \n4 WB. 1998. Concept Paper on a Microinsurance Pilot Project in NWFP. Washington,D.C. ", "    3 \nprices for health care and thus make the costs of services more transparent. At several levels, \nhealth insurance became an issue in Pakistan. The Federal Ministry of Health is discussing \nalternatives on how to extend coverage of health insurance. The Government of Punjab has \ninstalled a task force to look into the feasibility of health insurance for a broader population. \nInterest in the subject is thus increasing. \n \n13.  The affordability and sustainability of social protection in a country where economic \nindicators are weak has to be examined. Economic growth may be one source that can support \nsocial protection. The performance of several sectors of the economy has been improving this \nyear. But often such growth benefits only part of the population and does not lead to a \nproportional increase of welfare. Therefore, growth has to be pro-poor and socially inclusive, \nmeaning that it should contribute to poverty reduction. Social protection can be one element \ncontributing to this if the poor have mechanisms that protect them from shocks and increase \ntheir ability to take risks (for example business activities) to pursue livelihood. Social protection \ninterventions can have positive effects on the demand and the willingness of the people to take \nrisks, and contribute to building social cohesion and social stability in the country. The right \nmoment to start a discussion is when the problems emerge in order to be prepared for and to \nprepare pro-poor growth. Therefore it is necessary to identify appropriate sources of funding for \nsocial protection measures. First, funding can be effected by changing the budget allocation. \nFor this purpose, there is a need to show the Government what can be done with social \nprotection, what the benefits are, and what it costs. Second, existing programs can be analyzed \nin order to optimize the use of scarce funds. Third, the source can be foreign assistance. \nHowever, this has a risk of not being sustainable, especially for the poorest sections of the \nsociety. Therefore a long-term strategy is needed showing where funds might be needed. \nFourth, the source can be individual  contributions  (risk  pooling).  Insurance schemes have \nshown that they can protect people from economic risks like sickness, old age poverty, and \nnatural disasters. An extension of existing social insurance schemes may be an option. The TA \nwill examine all of these possible sources of funds to support social protection. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n14.  The purpose of the study is to assist the Government in elaborating ways of reducing \nvulnerability, particularly among the poorest sections of the society, and to contribute towards \ntranslating the Government\u2019s policy objective of poverty reduction into effective social protection \nprograms. The TA is in line with the PRSP and with ADB's Social Protection Strategy.  \n \n15.  The output will be a proposal to the Government for a comprehensive and coordinated \nplan for social protection development as well as a feasibility study for health insurance. The \nplan for social protection development will include (i) a definition of social protection in Pakistan; \n(ii) priority areas of intervention including a ranking of priorities \u2013 with a special focus on self-\nsustaining social protection mechanisms; (iii) target groups; (iv) identification of needs for \ninstitutional development; (v) costs of proposed interventions and financing options; and (vi) \npossible involvement of the Government, development partners, and ADB. The feasibility study \non health insurance will, as a result, provide recommendations for further activities. An outline of \nthe whole study can be found in Appendix 2. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n16.  The  TA  will  have  2  components:  Component  1  will  be  the  comprehensive  social \nprotection strategy covering all elements of social protection mentioned in the ADB Social ", "4 \n \nProtection  Strategy.  Component  2  will  be  a  feasibility  study  on  health  insurance,  as  one \nimportant part of social protection.  \n \n17.  Component 1 will provide a comprehensive analysis of the sector including the following \nactivities: (i) elaboration of an inventory of existing social protection arrangements (formal and \nnonformal), including description of arrangements, target group, coverage, financial dimensions, \nand  evaluation;  (ii)  assessment  and  evaluation  activities  by  NGOs  and  international  aid \nagencies; (iii) a needs assessment with the view to provide social protection; (iv) identification of \nquantitative  dimensions  of  social  protection;  (v)  identification  of  target  groups  for  social \nprotection activities, taking into account indigenous/ethnic minorities; (vi) identification of social \nprotection  measures  that  are  capable  of  reducing  poverty  and  helping  the  target  groups; \n(vii) identification  of  costs  and  financing  possibilities  for  these  measures;  and \n(viii) recommendations for further strategic interventions (plan of social protection development).  \n \n18.  Component 2: As a concrete application of the Social Protection Study, it is proposed to \nevaluate the possibility of a health insurance in Pakistan for population groups that are not \ncovered by existing arrangements and that have problems accessing adequate health care due \nto high costs of treatment. The activities of this component are (i) a situation analysis (health \nexpenditure, needs, and ability to pay of the poor households); (ii) defining target groups of a \npossible health insurance scheme; (iii) identification of implementation arrangements; (iv) needs \nfor awareness building among stakeholders; (v) evaluation of possible administrative setup; \n(vi) assessment of marketing needs and possibilities of the product, especially among the poor; \n(vii) assessment of possibilities of public-private partnerships; (viii) possible arrangements with \nproviders;  (ix)  administrative  arrangements;  (x)  product  design  and  benefits  of  a  health \ninsurance; (xi) estimates of costs of a possible health insurance plan; (xii) possible financing of \nhealth insurance; (xiii) possibilities of cooperation with and lessons learned from other projects \nin the field of health insurance; (xiv) recommendations for further actions; and (xv) lessons \nlearned from other countries. The component will be targeting the poor. The study is required \nbecause health insurance is new in Pakistan. There is little expertise about how to set up this \nkind of health insurance. If it should be possible to establish health insurance in Pakistan, \npublic-private partnerships might play an important role (for example with private insurance \ncompanies, especially in the fields of capacity building, risk sharing, and awareness building). \nAnother option is the involvement of the Zakat Fund, Fitrana, and other institutions in order to \nhelp to establish health insurance in Pakistan. All these options will be looked into during the \nfeasibility study. \n \n19.  Given the differences among the provinces in Pakistan, the geographical scope of the \nTA will be all four provinces. The TA will be closely coordinated with the ministries and \nstakeholders involved and other development partners. It will put special focus on possible \npublic-private  partnerships  and  involvement  of  NGOs.  Contacts  with  NGOs  and  private \ninsurance (EFU ALLIANZ) during reconnaissance and fact-finding showed a broad interest to \nsupport the TA. It will build on a series of studies and projects carried out by national and \ninternational organizations in terms of lessons learned. But given the limited size of other \nactivities, ADB will make a significant contribution to develop social protection and especially \nhealth insurance in the country. At least two workshops will be held with government agencies \ninvolved in social protection, development partners, NGOs, and academics. The study will be \nclosely coordinated with the planned ILO study on social protection in order to achieve synergy \nand avoid duplication. In the field of health insurance, experiences from the World Bank project \nwill be  taken into account. The final study will be published and shared with government \nagencies and interested aid agencies and stakeholders for future policy and project formulation. \n \n ", "    5 \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n20.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $437,500 equivalent, of which $263,000 will be \nforeign currency cost, and $174,500 equivalent will be local currency cost. ADB will finance \n$350,000 equivalent, which will include the entire foreign currency cost and $87,000 equivalent \nin  local  currency  costs.  The  remaining  $87,500  equivalent  will  be  contributed  by  the \nGovernment and will include office accommodation, counterpart staff remuneration, surveys, \nand workshops. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from ADB's TA funding program. The \ndetailed cost estimates and financing plan are shown in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n21.  The Executing Agency for the TA will be the Ministry of Labor (MoL), led by the Joint \nSecretary. A steering committee, headed by the Joint Secretary, MoL will be created. Members \nof  the  steering  committee  will  be  representatives  from  the  Ministry  of  Finance;  Planning \nCommission; Ministry of Health; Ministry of Women Development, Social Welfare and Special \nEducation;  as  well  as  provincial,  private  sector,  and  NGO  representatives.  The  steering \ncommittee will meet at least three times. The consulting team and the steering committee will be \nassisted by a technical working group (TWG). The main task of the TWG (see Appendix 4) is to \nserve as a critical partner in reviewing the outputs, give advice on optimizing the results, and \nsupport the project in specific areas. \n \n22.  The TA will be carried out over 5 months, beginning in November 2003 and ending in \nMarch 2004. There will be a total input of 22 person-months (pm) of consultancy: 10 pm of \ninternational and 12 pm of domestic services. The consulting team will include as international \nconsultants a social protection specialist/team leader (5 pm) and a health insurance specialist  \n(5 pm); and as domestic consultants an economist specializing in social protection (3 pm), a \nlegal specialist specializing in social and labor law (3 pm), a community development and \ngender specialist (3 pm), and a poverty analyst (3 pm).  \n \n23.  All consultants will be recruited through a firm using simplified technical proposals, in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines for the recruitment of consultants. Quality and Cost-Based \nSelection will be used for consultant selection. A project director from MoL will be in charge of \ncoordinating the other government agencies. \n \n24.  The consultants will submit three reports: An inception report will be submitted no later \nthan 2 weeks after fielding of the consultants. A draft final report will be submitted 4 months \nafter inception. Both the Government and ADB will provide comments on the draft final report. \nThe final report will be submitted within 1 month after receiving comments from the review. The \noutline terms of reference are in Appendix 4. \n  \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n25.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $350,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Pakistan for preparing the Social Protection Strategy Development Study, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board.
