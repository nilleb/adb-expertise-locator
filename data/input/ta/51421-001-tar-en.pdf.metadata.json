INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will increase the readiness of the \nGovernment of Aba Prefecture for investments in climate-resilient distributed heating based on \nrenewable energy in Barkam County in Sichuan Province. The TA will assist the local government \nin developing knowledge about and preparing a pre-feasibility study on renewable energy-based \nclimate-resilient distributed heating systems. \n \n2.  The TA is in the country operations business plan, 2018\u20132020 of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) for the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC).1 It fully aligns with ADB\u2019s country \npartnership strategy, 2016\u20132020 for the PRC\u2019s priority on managing climate change and the \nenvironment for an ecological civilization.2 It will support the strategic priorities of Strategy 20303 \nto build climate resilience and enhance environmental sustainability.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Barkam County is the city seat of Aba Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture in \nSichuan Province, which lies in a cold, high-altitude region in southern PRC. Barkam has an \naverage elevation of 2,650 meters and is an alpine-gorge city with a heating season that lasts \nmore than 6 months. Its annual temperature ranges from 8\u00b0C to 9\u00b0C and its winter temperature \noften drops to \u201310\u00b0C. Heating services are therefore essential for public health and well-being \nand for the sustenance of people\u2019s livelihoods. However, the county does not have a central \nheating system as it lacks fossil fuels, faces high fuel transportation costs, and has low fuel \ncombustion efficiency because of the low density of oxygen associated with high altitude. \n \n4.  As in other regions in southern PRC, space heating in Barkam relies on independent \nsystems such as electric heaters, biomass burning, and coal-fired stoves. Such heating systems \nare generally energy inefficient and costly and present potential safety hazards and health \nconcerns. Developing an energy-efficient and affordable space heating system is one of the \nhighest development priorities in Barkam, which is facing rising heating demand from its growing \npopulation. \n \n5.  Aba has abundant renewable energy resources. Its electricity supply is fully dependent on \nrenewable energy power plants, mainly from hydropower, which comprises 96.6% of installed \ncapacity and generated 18.8 terawatt-hours of power in 2017.5 The recoverable potential is 5.5 \ngigawatts for solar power and 2.3 gigawatts for wind power. Aba\u2019s electricity supply exceeds \ndemand  and  surplus  electricity  is  exported  to neighboring  regions. To  meet  rising  heating \ndemand,  improve  energy  efficiency,  and  reduce  air  pollutant  emissions  from  heating,  the \nGovernment of Barkam County has been seeking sustainable heating systems that use rich \nrenewable energy resources and targeting to develop a renewable energy-based distributed \nheating system, as reflected in its urban development plan approved in 2017. A renewable \nenergy-based  distributed  heating  system  can  meet  space  heating  demand  in  commercial \nbuildings and apartment complexes using heating technologies that supply carbon- and pollutant-\nfree sustainable services. In general, renewable energy technologies for heating include ones \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2018.

Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila. \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 28 June 2018. \n5  The current installed hydropower capacity is 5.6 gigawatts. \n ", "2 \nthat can directly convert renewable energy into heat, such as solar thermal energy storage; and \nones that use power generated from renewable sources, such as electric thermal storage or \nshallow-ground thermal storage-coupled heat pump. The renewable energy-based distributed \nheating solution will be the first of its kind in a high-altitude region in the PRC, with large potential \nfor scale-up and duplication in other regions in the country. It could particularly provide valuable \nexperience to existing heating system renovations in northern PRC. \n \n6.  Heat loss from buildings in Barkam is high due to building vintage. In general, air leaks \nfrom doors and windows contribute 40%\u201350% of total building heat loss in rural housing in the \nPRC.6 Improving building thermal efficiency is an efficient approach to reduce heat loss and save \nheating costs. \n \n7.  The city is vulnerable to climate change and has a fragile ecosystem because of high \naltitude.  Developing  a  renewable  energy-based  distributed  heating  system  requires  finding \ntechnically feasible, commercially viable, affordable, and sustainable solutions with an adequate \ndegree of flexibility and robustness that would allow adaptation to uncertainties related to climate \nchange and socioeconomic development. Failure to consider the potential impact of climate \nchange in the heating system\u2019s design could lead to inefficiency and underperformance of the \nunderlying investment, compromising mitigation efforts. Among the uncertainties to consider are: \n \n(i)  Renewable energy generation. Long-term grid power supply could be affected \nby a possible change in available water resources because of climate change, \ngiven  the  dominant role  of hydropower  in the  energy  mix.  If the  security  of \nhydropower is projected to be uncertain in the future, proposed technology options \nneed to be less dependent on grid power supply. \n(ii)  Technology operations. Different technologies are exposed to specific climatic \nvariables. For example, for underground thermal energy storage, climate change \nwill influence its performance through changes in annual mean air temperature, \npermafrost melt, and aquifer availability. \n(iii)  Heating  demand.  Heating  demand  uncertainties  can  emerge  from  extreme \nweather conditions because of climate change and socioeconomic development. \nFor example, a severe cold spell, elongated winter seasons, or unexpected rapid \nurbanization can increase heating demand. If those uncertainties were not factored \ninto the project design, technological design would be locked and the investment\u2019s \nenvironmental and financial sustainability might be compromised. \n \n8.  There are valuable experiences and lessons from several activities on renewable energy-\nbased heating systems that ADB has supported in the PRC.7 The TA will draw from such \nexperiences and lessons from existing activities to improve the design of the renewable energy-\nbased heating system and cross-fertilizing the knowledge. \n \n                                                \n6  Y.
