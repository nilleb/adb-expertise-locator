INTRODUCTION \n1.  During  a  country  program  reconfirmation  mission  following  the  election  of  the  new \nGovernment in Papua New Guinea (PNG), the Government reconfirmed the request that the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) provide technical assistance (TA) to comprehensively review \nagricultural  and  natural  resource  policies  and  strategies  and  prepare  a  project  for  ADB \nfinancing.1 At the Government\u2019s request, a two-phase process will be followed: (i) phase 1\u2014\nreview  and  participatory  strategy  development,  and  (ii)  phase  2\u2014project  preparation.  The \nGovernment has agreed with the TA goals, purpose, scope and implementation arrangements, \ncost and financing arrangements, and terms of reference. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Nonmining rural industries offer direct employment and food security for about 87% of \nthe  population,  and  about  30%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  comes  from  agriculture, \nforestry, and fishing. Key agricultural industries (apart from oil palm) have generally performed \npoorly in the past two decades, leading to declining export earnings in dollar terms; rural \nemployment has not expanded since 1980.2 Over 90% of the poor live in rural areas. The \nGovernment recently stated that a major cornerstone of its economic strategy will be reviving \nthe  export  sector  and  supporting  rural  development.  However,  despite  improving \ncompetitiveness  of  exports  (and  of  domestically  produced  food)  following  the  significant \ndepreciation of the kina (the national currency), the institutions and policies are not in place to \nget agriculture moving.3 The institutional fabric is highly fragmented, with many overlapping \nresponsibilities and underresourced agencies at the national, provincial, industry, and sector \nlevels. A coherent framework of policies and institutional arrangements is urgently required as \npart of a strategy for sustainable agriculture and natural resource development.  \n \n3.  PNG has extremely diverse farming systems matched by diverse cultural traditions. A \nmixture of semisubsistence, exchange, and market-oriented production at the household level \nresults  from  the  rugged  topography,  a  wide  range  of  agroecological  conditions,  significant \nlinguistic and ethnic diversity, widely differing value systems and beliefs on many aspects of life, \nand different levels of social and economic development. The level of biodiversity is very high in \nthe country. Of the total arable land area of about 12.5 million hectares (ha), only about 3% \n(400,000 ha) have high agricultural potential, and these areas are widely distributed and often a \nconsiderable distance from markets. Village-based agriculture is dominant, typically featuring a \ncombination of food gardens, small stands of export crops, and livestock. Cash crop productivity \nlevels for village agriculture are low compared to larger-scale operations on plantations or \nagribusiness operations. Most people live on land they own under customary arrangements, \nand about 97% of land is held under customary arrangements where formal title does not exist. \nDue to the rugged topography, infrastructure and maintenance costs are high. The extensive \ninfrastructure system, constructed from the 1950s to the 1970s, which connected extensive rural \nareas to markets, has severely deteriorated due to neglect, transforming the outlook for the rural \neconomy and severely constraining its options. \n \n4.  Services  to  support  these  diverse  farming  systems  have  not  been  adequately \ndeveloped. Even in the early years following independence, when the rural economy was  \n__________________ \n1  Building on earlier missions, formal TA fact-finding was undertaken 21\u201325 October 2002. The TA first appeared in \nADB Business Opportunities on 12 June 2002. \n2 The coffee, cocoa, copra, tea, and rubber industries are either stagnant or in decline. The oil palm industry is one \nexception, expanding steadily from its beginning in the 1970s to 29% of the value of agricultural exports in 2000.  \n3 The value of the PNG kina was K1=$0.25 at TA fact-finding, compared to K1=$1.49 in 1981.  \n ", "2  \nrelatively vibrant and export prices were high, the range of rural services was very basic. \nEffective rural financial services were generally not available for small farmers, but competitive \nmarketing  services  were  to  most  producers;  and  roads  were  maintained  and  basic  social \nservices operated effectively, albeit with limited access by many households. The quality and \neffectiveness of services have seriously declined in recent years, and the gradual decline of \nroad, shipping, and airline coverage has reduced the possibility of delivering effective rural \nservices.  Increasing  lawlessness  and  lack  of  employment,  combined  with  constrained  and \nineffectively used government budgets, have had highly adverse consequences for rural life.  \n \n5.  The Department of Agriculture and Livestock (DAL) is the central agency for agricultural \npolicy, planning, and monitoring market trends, but has very limited capacity or resources to \nundertake its core functions and to effectively develop policies or advocate strategic directions. \nThe provincial departments of primary industry (PDPIs), which are responsible for extension \nservices,  are  similarly  starved  of  funds,  poorly  coordinated,  and  cannot  provide  effective \nservices. At the industry level, clear ideas and plans as to the main priorities exist, but adequate \nresources are not available. Industry priorities are also not necessarily shared by the central \nGovernment, which has the responsibility for providing most budget resources. The lack of clear \npolicy and implementation capacity has also led to a decline in international assistance to the \nsector.  \n \n6.  Not all agricultural services have declined in quality. The National Agricultural Research \nInstitute (NARI) has developed a farming systems approach and has close relationships with a \nbroad  client  group  for  delivering  improved  productivity  approaches,  but  is  inadequately \nresourced despite international assistance, notably from Australia. Ongoing church-based rural \nservices  are  often  extensive  and  effective  and  offer  potential  for  broad  replication. \nNongovernment organizations (NGO) services are significant, but are localized. Some of the \nvarious specialized institutions, largely commodity based, operate relatively effectively, due in \npart to market-oriented administration and greater responsiveness to clients. Private sector \ninitiatives  and  innovations  supported  by  external  funding  agencies  in  extension  services, \nmicrofinance,  or  linkages  to  value-added  markets  have  been  introduced  (especially  in  the \nnucleus-focused  industries),  but  not  adequately  mainstreamed.  Partnerships  between \ngovernment services and civil-society groups are few, but given the highly localized nature of \nPNG  society  and  the  tradition  of  a  wide  range  of  private  stakeholders  in  the  agricultural \neconomy, scope is considerable to rapidly expand services in rural PNG, building on effective \npartnerships between government and nongovernment groups.4 \n \n7.  Although a number of insightful external reviews have emerged in recent years and the \nstate of the rural economy has been well analyzed, many recommendations in these reports \nhave  not  been  adequately  debated  or  even  considered  in  Government,  although  valuable \ndialogue has occurred in the private sector. Despite these and other reviews, and excellent \nanalytical  data  on  the  status  of  agricultural  systems  and  potential  at  the  provincial  level, \ninadequate use has been made of this work. The arguments in support of policy, institutional, or \ntechnical innovations in the agriculture sector have not been convincingly made at the central \ngovernment level, and action to arrest sector decline has been inadequate. This is largely due to \nthe lack of a consensus on reform within the Government and uncertainty about what needs to \nbe  done.  Hence,  public  investment  has  inadequately  addressed  the  needs  of  the  sector, \nincluding for transport. The trend in recent years may have worsened as the economy has \ncontracted and expenditures have been constrained.  \n__________________ \n4  Loan 1652-PNG, Smallholder Support Services Pilot Project, for $7.6 million, approved on 10 December 1998, \nsupports a promising example of innovative promotion of government-nongovernment partnerships.  \n ", "                        3\n \n8.  As PNG\u2019s fiscal situation has declined significantly in recent years and the medium-term \noutlook is bleak, successful implementation of a viable strategy will also require streamlining of \ninstitutions to align with budget reality and focus more attention on the rural economy.5 The \ntightening of the fiscal situation is due to a secular decline in mineral revenues, exacerbated in \n2002 by overexpenditure during the first half of the year. Although the Government that came to \npower in August 2002 is taking drastic action to restrain expenditure, the stringency will need to \nbe  sustained  over  the  medium  term,  which  requires  careful  streamlining  of  public  service \nprograms and close attention to effectiveness, particularly to mitigate the poverty impacts.  \n \n9.  The following are urgently needed: (i) a coherent strategy for the future, (ii) the main \npriority reforms and an appropriate sequence for improving the productivity of village agriculture \nand natural resource management, (iii) how these changes will best be implemented, and (iv) \nhow the most important changes could be financed at a time of national fiscal crisis.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n10.  The  overall  goal  is  to  help  the  Government  articulate  and  then  implement  a  clear \nnational vision for agriculture and natural resource development. The specific purpose of the TA \nis to prepare and gain consensus on a coherent strategy for agricultural and natural resource \ndevelopment and to formulate a project that will enable the Government to implement key \nelements of the strategy. This will be achieved through a two-phase process, beginning with \nagreement on the following four main outputs: (i) a consistent policy and legal framework, (ii) \nsector priorities and strategies covering the main domestic and export industries, (iii) defined \nkey stakeholder mandates and roles, and (iv) an effective monitoring and learning mechanism. \nThis work will be undertaken in a participatory manner in phase 1 of the TA. Phase 2 will build \non the outputs of phase 1 and, if deemed appropriate, design a project for loan financing to help \nimplement priority reforms and complementary development activities.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  Phase  1  of  the  TA  will  provide  an  agreed-on  and  fully  owned  sector  review  and \nparticipatory  strategy  development  as  a  basis  for  specific  project  design  in  phase  2.  An \nanalytical review will be undertaken of the agriculture and natural resource sector and its recent \nperformance and medium-term outlook. Recent studies, reviews, socioeconomic projections, \nand lessons learned from past projects will be fully considered. Key constraints to developing a \ncoherent  strategy  for  agricultural  and  natural  resource  development  will  be  identified.  A \nsummary rural outlook for the next decade will be prepared to brief participants in various \nworkshops.  \n \n12.  The following work will be covered in phase 1:  \n \n(i)  Legislative and institutional review. The legal and regulatory arrangements \nand institutional mandates will be reviewed, placing attention on the consistency \nof national, provincial, and local laws and regulations and the effectiveness of \nenforcement.  Impediments  to  improved  market  efficiency  and  service \n__________________ \n5 Over the next 20 years, only a small minority of the population (expanding at about 2.7% annually) is anticipated to \nbe absorbed into paid employment.  \n ", "4  \ndevelopment will be identified, especially with respect to overlapping jurisdictions \nand  roles,  resource  availability,  and  the  need  for  streamlining.  Institutions' \ndelivery  modalities  will  be  examined  to  see  where  they  are  most  and  least \neffective in providing services, especially for smallholder farming systems, and \nthe requirements for reforms and capacity development. Innovations in services \nor other areas of ongoing reform will be examined for replication in a wider \ncontext. \n \n(ii)  Policies and strategies. The existing policy and strategy framework will be \nreviewed, based on recent government  papers, DAL corporate plans and briefs, \nand relevant policies and plans of the key industries. The review will identify  \n(a) whether  the  policy  regime  is adequate  and  deliverable  to support  PNG\u2019s \ncomplex farming systems and sustainable rural livelihoods, (b) policy consistency \nand areas where perverse incentives are provided and conflict with market-based \nprinciples,  (c)  coherence  between  agencies  and  industries,  (d)  areas  for \nimproved donor coordination, and (e) enforcement capacity.  \n \n(iii)  Public expenditure review and budget projections. A consolidated financial \nstatement of all relevant service agencies (government and nongovernment) will \nbe  prepared,  including  those  involved  in  financial  and  marketing  services, \nshowing  past  trends  and  projections  for  the  next  5\u201310  years.  International \ncomparisons  with  selected  Pacific  and  Asian  developing  member  countries \n(DMCs) will also be prepared. The extent to which the Government and the \nsector can afford the existing structure under the constrained fiscal outlook will \nbe examined, and alternatives will be proposed to inform sector stakeholders, \nworkshop participants, and other interested parties.  \n \n(iv)  Participatory  workshops.  Workshops  on  the  various  crops  and  subsector \ngroups (one per industry for coffee, cocoa, oil palm, copra, tea, rubber, fisheries, \nlivestock, minor export crops, and food crops) will be conducted for up to 3 days \neach as required.6 The workshops will (a) consider the enabling environment for \ninvestment and development; (b) discuss and agree on the key constraints to \nsustainable development; (c) examine existing industry policies, strategies, and \nplans, and how to implement and/or amend them as needed; (d) examine service \ndelivery effectiveness, including financial services; and (e) recommend an action \nplan and the sequencing of necessary actions. Feedback will be obtained from \nmajor stakeholders, including senior government officials, government agencies, \nfarmers and local communities, input and output marketing agents, traders and \nfinanciers, research bodies, external agencies, and NGOs. The main outputs will \nbe consensus on and ownership of key strategy elements and implementation \narrangements.  Results  of  each  workshop  will  be  compiled  in  a  set  of \nrecommendations.  \n \n13.  Phase 2 will build from the results of the phase 1 and design a project, if appropriate, \nsuitable for loan financing. Careful assessment of potential viability will be required before \nproceeding to project design. It will include economic, social, and environmental analyses. The \nproposed project will enable Government to implement key elements of the agreed-on strategy. \nPhase 2 will include a national policy seminar at the beginning, and a national stakeholder \nworkshop to review the draft project design. \n__________________ \n6 Industry and donor feedback will be required to avoid duplication. \n ", "                        5\n \nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n14.  The cost of the project will be $1.25 million equivalent, comprising $610,000 in foreign \ncurrency costs and $640,000 in local currency costs. ADB will finance all foreign currency costs \nand $390,000 of local currency costs. Government and domestic private sector agencies will \nfinance $250,000 equivalent, largely in kind. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government has been advised \nthat approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. Details of the cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The Department of National Planning and Rural Development will be the TA Executing \nAgency and will provide guidance and overall coordination of the domestic agencies involved, \nincluding  DAL,  NARI,  PDPIs,  and  the  representative  agencies  for  key  industries.  A  TA \nimplementation unit will coordinate implementation.  \n \n16.  The TA will go on for about 12 months, from about March 2003 to March 2004. Phase 1 \n(6 months) will require 10 person-months of international consultants and 16 person-months of \ndomestic consultants. After a 1-month break to consider the results of phase 1, phase 2 (5 \nmonths)  will  focus  on  project  preparation,  requiring  14  person-months  of  international \nconsultants and 20 person-months of domestic consultants. International expertise will cover  \n(i) agricultural and natural resources policy, (ii) institutions and capacity development, (iii) legal \nand regulatory aspects, (iv) rural financial markets, (v) marketing, (vi) research and extension \nservices, and (vii) economic and financial analysis. Domestic expertise will cover (i) public \npolicy/planning,  (ii) finance  and  budgeting,  (iii)  extension,  (iv) community  development,  and \n(v) legal and regulatory aspects. A firm of consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance \nwith its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for \nthe  engagement  of  domestic  consultants,  and  selected  by  using  the  simplified  technical \nproposal  procedure  and  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method.  Equipment  will  be \nprocured by the consultants in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for Procurement. As detailed \nin the terms of reference (Appendix 4), the consultants will submit four reports (inception, \nphase 1, draft final, final).  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Papua New Guinea for Preparing the Agriculture and Rural Development \nProject, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6 Appendix 1 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK:1 PHASE 1 \n \n \n       \n  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Indicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \n     \nGoal       \nDevelop a clear national  Increased government  Updated White Paper on  Policy, institutional, and \nvision for agricultural  budget allocation to rural  Agriculture and Natural  regulatory environment is \nand natural resource  development  Resources   suitable to develop new rural \ndevelopment       development initiatives. \nSustainable approaches  Government statistics on   \nto support ecologically  investment and rural  Budget is available for, and \nsound, socially  output  the Government is \nacceptable, and viable    committed to, rural \npractices that address  Grower surveys  development. \nrural poverty reduction     \n    Attitudes of rural \nCoherent institutional  communities are conducive \nstructures, expanded  to reforms.

Background \n \n1.  The Government of Papua New Guinea (PNG) has requested assistance to develop a \nclear  national  vision  for  agricultural  and  natural  resource  development.  Nonmining  rural \nindustries offer direct employment and food security for about 87% of the population, and 30-\n35% of gross development product comes from agriculture, forestry, and fishing. Over 90% of \nthe poor live in rural areas. Rural industry performance is generally static or declining, and, with \nonly a few exceptions, rural employment is not expanding.1 Moreover the country\u2019s demographic \nstructure is young, and the population has expanded at 2.7% annually in the two decades \nbefore 2000. Lack of employment is a key factor facing a restless and increasingly frustrated \nrural population.2 Rural violence is common along major arterial roads, and urban violence has \nreached extreme levels, especially in the national capital, Port Moresby.  \n \n2.  Although a number of insightful reviews have been written in recent years and the state \nof PNG\u2019s rural economy is generally understood, action to remedy its decline has not been \nsupported with adequate resources. A coherent strategy for the future is lacking. At the industry \nor sector level, however, ideas and plans as to the main priorities are clear but implementation \narrangements and resources are not available. Industry priorities are not necessarily shared by \nthe central Government, which has the responsibility for providing most budget resources. A \nnational consensus is lacking with respect to what the main priorities and reforms should be, \nhow they might be best sequenced, how they might be best implemented, and how the most \nimportant changes could be financed at a time of national fiscal crisis.  \n \nB.  Outline Terms of Reference  \n1.  Phase 1: Review and Participatory Strategy Development  \n3.  Phase 1 will provide an overview of sector performance, a legislative and institutional \nframework, and a budget assessment prior to a series of participatory workshops that will be \nheld  in  the  each  of  the  main  industry  centers.  The  outcome  of  the  workshops  will  be  a \nconsensus view of the major reforms needed, and their priority. The consultants will work with \nthe Department of National Planning and Rural Development to develop a consensus among \nthe domestic agencies involved, which include Department of Agriculture and Livestock (DAL), \nNational Agricultural Research Institute, Provincial Departments of Primary Industry, and the \nrepresentative agencies for key agencies.3 Involvement of senior political representatives will be \nessential. \n \n__________________ \n1 The coffee, cocoa, copra, tea, and rubber industries are either stagnant or in decline. The oil palm industry is one \nexception, expanding steadily from its beginning in the 1970s to 29% of the value of agricultural exports in 2000. \nOther expanding agricultural industries have relatively insignificant employment value; e.g., vanilla is a minor crop \nthat has expanded rapidly in recent years. \n2  Low commodity prices and lack of maintenance of rural infrastructure have led to declining output and rural \nincomes in many parts of the country. Declining effectiveness of social services such as education and health has \nalso played a part in the growing rural malaise. \n3   Coffee Industry Corporation, Cocoa Board and the Cocoa and Coconuts Research Institute, Oil Palm Industry \nCorporation and the Oil Palm Research Association, Rural Development Bank, Rural Industries Council, National \nFisheries  Authority,  Livestock  Development  Corporation,  Kokonas  Indastri  Korporesen,  Fresh  Produce \nDevelopment Company, Ramu Sugar Limited, and other major stakeholders.  \n ", "10 Appendix 4 \n4.  Phase 1 will take 6 months to complete and require approximately 10 person-months of \ninternational consultants and 16 person-months of domestic consultants. It will consist of the \nfollowing tasks, as described below. A project framework for phase 1 is also provided (Appendix \n1).  \n \n5.  Sector  Review  and  Performance  Assessment.  The  consultants  will  conduct  an \nanalytical review of the agriculture sector, and its recent performance and outlook based on \nindicators appropriate for the respective subsectors, including rural financial markets. Recent \nstudies, reviews, socioeconomic projections, and lessons learned from past projects should be \nfully taken into account. Where appropriate, quantitative analyses will complement the existing \nreviews. The key constraints on developing a coherent strategy for agricultural and natural \nresource development will be identified in the paper. A sector outlook overview focused on the \nrural outlook for the next decade will be prepared to brief participants in various workshops and \nas background for various interest groups.  \n \n6.  Legislative and Institutional Review. The legal and regulatory arrangements and the \ninstitutional mandates will also be reviewed. Attention will be placed on national and provincial \nlaws and regulations and the effectiveness of enforcement. Impediments to improve market \nefficiency and service development will be identified. The consistency of this framework will be \nexamined, especially with respect to overlapping jurisdictions, duplication of roles, and the need \nfor streamlining of responsibilities. The delivery systems used by the various institutions in \nundertaking their duties will be examined to see where they are most and least effective in \nproviding  services\u2014especially  for  smallholder  farming  systems,  and  their  requirements  for \nreforms, changed structure, and capacity development. The main outputs of the key institutions \nwill be examined in terms of service delivery for clients. Innovations in services or other areas of \nongoing reform will be examined for replication in a wider context.  \n \n7.  Policies  and  Strategies.  The  existing  policy  and  strategy  framework  will  also  be \nreviewed. Recent government papers and briefs prepared by the Department of Agriculture and \nLivestock, and relevant policies and plans of the key industries will be examined.4 The review \nwill identify (i) whether the policy regime is supportive, adequate, and deliverable to support \nPNG\u2019s complex farming systems and sustainable rural livelihoods; (ii) policy consistency and \nareas where perverse incentives are provided or encouraged and which conflict with market-\nbased principles; (iii) coherency between agencies and industries; (iv) areas for improved donor \ncoordination; and (v) enforcement capacity.  \n  \n8.  Public  Expenditure  Review  and  Budget  Projections.  A  consolidated  financial \nstatement of all relevant service agencies, government and nongovernment, and financial and \nmarketing services, will show past trends and projections for the next 5-10 years from the \ncurrent  base.  The  statement  will  also  include  personnel,  operation  and  maintenance,  and \noverhead costs. International comparisons with selected Pacific and Asian developing member \ncountries will also be prepared. The extent to which the Government can afford the existing \nstructure  under  its  constrained  fiscal  outlook  will  be  examined,  and  alternatives  will  be \nproposed. This will be also used to inform sector stakeholders, workshop participants, and other \ninterested parties.  \n \n__________________ \n4 The Department of Agriculture and Livestock (DAL) has prepared briefing papers such as Brief on the Functions of \nthe Agricultural Sector (July 2002) and a related Ministerial Brief (DAL). The coffee industry has also developed its \nown plans. External reviews will be also fully used. \n ", "  Appendix 4  11\n9.  Participatory  Industry  Workshops:  The  consultants  will  help  the  relevant  industry \nassociation/body  and  the  Government  organize  the  participatory  workshops.  Workshops \n(possibly one per industry for coffee, cocoa, oil palm, copra, tea, rubber, fisheries, livestock, \nminor export crops, and food crops) will be conducted for up to 3 days each as required. The \nworkshops on the various crops and subsectors will (i) consider the enabling environment for \ninvestment  and  development;  (ii) discuss  and  agree  on the  key  constraints  to  sustainable \ndevelopment;  (iii)  examine  existing  industry  policies,  strategies,  and  plans  and  how  to \nimplement/amend  them  as  needed;  (iv)  examine  service  delivery  effectiveness,  including \nfinancial services; and (v) recommend an action plan and the sequencing of necessary actions. \nThe consultants will present the findings from the above work and collect feedback from major \nstakeholders, including government agencies, farmers and local communities, input and output \nmarketing  agents,  traders  and  financiers,  research  bodies,  external  agencies,  and \nnongovernment  office.  The  main  outputs  from  the  workshops  will  be  identification  of  key \nstrategy elements and ways to implement these strategies. Emphasis will be placed on gaining \nconsensus  on  the  main  actions  needed,  and  phasing.  At  the  end  of  each  workshop,  the \nconsultants will compile the results into set of recommendations in summary format.  \n \n10.  Initial Project Preparation. Based on their extensive stakeholder consultations, the \nconsultants will lay the groundwork for the ensuing project preparation, by making an initial \nidentification of monitorable criteria and indicators, where the focus will be on outputs rather \nthan inputs. The phase 1 consultants will also make preliminary suggestions regarding the \npotential project framework (logframe), as well as recommendations for the modality (sector \ndevelopment project or simple investment project). The consultants will also undertake further \nsocial screening to clarify and define any likely involuntary resettlement impacts, to help to \nrefine the terms of reference for phase 2. \n \n2.  Phase 2: Project Preparation  \n11.  The  results  of  the  industry  workshops  will  provide  the  broad  direction  for  project \npreparation in the phase 2. Following a 1-month break after phase 1, the Government, together \nwith industry representative groups, will examine the outputs of the workshops and the report of \nphase 1 in a 5-day national policy seminar to be held at the beginning of month 8. Participation \nof senior government officials, including political representatives, will be essential to build a \nshared vision for the future and strong ownership of subsequent actions. The consulting team \nwill  assist  in  this  process.  At  the  completion  of  the  national  workshop,  a  tripartite  review \ninvolving the Government, consultants, and Asian Development Bank (ADB) will be held. This \nmeeting will confirm the priorities for the work of phase 2. During the tripartite review, agreement \nwill be reached on an initial project framework (logframe) for the project, including monitorable \ncriteria and indicators, focused on outputs rather than inputs. A critical focus for the policy \nseminar and the tripartite review will be to assess the appropriate mixture of reforms measures \nand complementary development activities to be pursued, and the appropriate modality (sector \ndevelopment program or investment project). The prospects of a viable project need to be \nthoroughly assessed before moving on to detailed project design. Project design will need to \nincorporate economic, social, and environmental considerations, following ADB requirements.  \n \n12.  Phase 2 will take 5 months to complete and require approximately 14 person-months of \ninternational consultants and 20 person-months of domestic consultants. It will consist of the \nfollowing tasks:  \n \n(i)  National policy seminar. The national policy seminar at the beginning of phase \n2,  the  objectives,  major  outputs  and  the  sequencing  required  for  a \n ", "12 Appendix 4 \ncomprehensive  approach  to  reform  will  be  articulated.  The  main \nrecommendations will be incorporated into the design of the project.  \n(ii)  Project  design.  Based  on  prior  consultative  process  and  feedback  from \nworkshops/policy  seminar,  detailed  project  design  will  be  undertaken  by  the \nconsultants and their counterparts. \n(iii)  National stakeholder  workshop. Representatives will be invited to  a 4-day \nworkshop at the end of month 9 or early in month 10 to review and finalize the \ndraft  project  design  and  identify  the  key  impacts,  risks,  and  implementation \naspects. Donor organizations will also be invited to this workshop. \n(iv)  Project costs and financing. The COSTAB software package will be used to \nformalize all project costs and financiers.  \n \n13.  A second tripartite meeting will be held at the end of month 11 to review the draft project \nas outlined in the draft final report. If a consensus is not reached on the final project design and \nfinancing and implementation arrangements, a second national stakeholder workshop may be \nheld to finalize the main elements of the proposed project. \n \n14.  A  critical  focus  of  the  project  design,  and  subsequent  implementation,  will  be  the \ndevelopment impact of the project. A fundamental aspect of project preparation will be the \ndevelopment  of  monitorable  criteria  and  indicators,  focused  on  outputs  rather  than  inputs. \nIndicators will get systematic attention during project preparation, by consultants and ADB staff. \nThe project framework (logframe) will be the core design mechanism. All normal ADB standards \nand requirements for project preparation will be followed. \n \n15.  Reports.  The  consultants  will  submit  four  reports.  An  inception  report  is  to  be \nsubmitted within 1.75 months of commencement of the technical assistance will present the \ninitial findings, recommendations and layout of the phase `1 report. A phase 1 report, to be \nsubmitted at the end of phase 1 (end of month 6), will describe the main findings of the \nworkshops and the recommended elements of the action plan. A draft final report summarizing \nthe consensus at the national policy seminar at the beginning of phase 2 and the draft design \nand costs of the proposed project will be produced at the end of month 10. A final report will \nincorporate the results of the final tripartite meeting and be submitted after 11.5 months.  \n \n \n \n "], "metadata": {"Creator": "R373-02 - Microsoft Word", "CreationDate": "D:20030102165031", "Title": "R373-02", "Author": "rsa", "Producer": "Acrobat PDFWriter 4.0 for Windows NT", "ModDate": "D:20030109094556+08'00'"}}
