INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) requested that the technical \nassistance (TA) for Development of Economic Laws II focus on the making of competition laws, \nincluding amending the Law against Unfair Competition (adopted in September 1993) and \npreparing  the  Anti-Monopoly  Law.1  Fact-Finding  Missions  (the  Mission)2  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) visited Beijing and held meetings with officials of the Ministry of \nFinance, Legislative Affairs Commission  (LAC) of the National People\u2019s Congress (NPC), \nMinistry of Commerce (MOFCOM), and State Administration of Industry and Commerce (SAIC).  \nUnderstanding was reached on the TA objective, scope, cost estimates and financing plan, \nterms of reference for the consultants, and implementation arrangements. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  More than two decades of economic reform and opening policy  released unprecedented \ndynamics in PRC\u2019s economy.  Developing and maintaining an effective and fair competition \nenvironment  are  critical  to  the  success  of  further  reforming  PRC\u2019s  economy  and  meeting \nchallenges arising from the opening up of PRC\u2019s market to foreign investors after the PRC joins \nthe World Trade Organization.   \n \n3.  Unfair competition is recognized by the Government, market players, and  consumers as \na major impediment in improving efficiency, safeguarding consumers\u2019 interest, and promoting  \nentrepreneurship in the country. Unfair competition practices include, among others, practices \ninfringing on intellectual property rights, corrupt activities such as offering bribes and kickbacks \nin sale promotion, misleading and deceptive advertisement, illegal possession of commercial \nsecrets, defamation of competitors, market collusion, tied sales, monopoly at predatory prices, \nand other monopoly practices. Because of the greater complexity in the policy-making and \nimplementation process, monopoly practices stand out as a more difficult impediment to the \nmaintenance of a fair and competitive market.  \n \n4.  Currently in the PRC monopoly practices are found in three forms: (i) the sectors in \nwhich State-owned enterprises (SOEs) have been traditionally dominant and where  monopolies \nare achieved and maintained due to the link to administrative authorities before the completion \nof SOE reform; (ii) protection of  regional markets by the local governments; (iii) commercial \nmonopolies through various unfair competition activities in the market, in particular foreign \ninvestment  through  mergers  and  acquisitions.  These  monopoly  practices  are  mingled, \nrespectively, with SOE  reform and privatization, regional development, industry and sector \ndevelopment, and foreign investment policies. The natural monopoly in certain sectors such as \npower supply and transmission, railway, and telecommunications raises the issue of how to \nkeep the economy of scale on one hand and, on the other, introduce and maintain competition \nin these sectors. \n \n5.  The current legal and regulatory regime is not adequate to address the cited three types \nof monopolies.  The approach in existing laws only defining certain monopoly practices by \nrelatively more static tests fails to offer a theoretical underpinning for analyzing and balancing \nthe complicated anti-monopoly and other policy objectives and to designate an authority or \n                                                 \n1 The TA is included in the Country Strategy and Program (2004-2006) and first appeared in ADB Business  \nOpportunities (Internet Edition) in June 2004 under the name Development of Economic Laws II \u2013 Competition \nPolicy and Anti-Monopoly Law.  \n2 The Mission comprised a fact-finding mission on 8\u201315 June consisting of Xiaohua Peng, mission leader/principal \ncounsel; and Kamal Ahmad, counsel; and a fact-finding follow-on mission on 17\u201325 September 2004 comprising \nXiaohua Peng, mission leader/principal counsel.  ", "2 \nauthorities in charge of formulating and implementing anti-monopoly policies. Therefore, the \nregulatory regime based on existing laws cannot provide effective enforcement procedures for \nanti-monopoly investigation, public hearing and debate, determination of monopoly; and impose \nadministrative or judicial measures to curb, break, and penalize illegal monopolies.   \n \n6.  Since no single law applies specifically to anti-monopoly activities, the rules on anti-\nmonopoly are currently scattered in different laws and regulations, such as the Law against \nUnfair Competition, Price Law (adopted in 1997), Telecommunication Regulation (adopted in \nSeptember 2000), and Provisional Method for Regulating Mergers and Acquisitions of Chinese \nEnterprises  by  Foreign  Investors  (adopted  in  2001).3  The  scattered  rules  cloud  the  policy \nimperatives because of lack of clear policy objectives and parameters for determining illegal \nmonopoly, and leave room for contradictory legal provisions.  \n \n7.  The responsibilities to safeguard competition were shared mainly by the former State \nEconomics  and  Trade  Commission  (SETC),4  SAIC,  and  the  then  State  Development \nCommission  (renamed  as  the  National  Development  Reform  Commission).  After  the \nGovernment restructuring, the newly established MOFCOM (based on the former Ministry of \nForeign Trade and Economic Cooperation) was also involved in the formulation of competition \npolicy and regulations regarding monopoly activities, particularly in connection with foreign \ninvestment. In the absence of a clearly designated competition policy authority, the regulators in \ncertain sectors are left with the powers to form industry policies and competition policy in the \nconcerned  sectors  the  result  is  policy  conflicts  and  entrenched  monopoly  in  the  sectors \ndominated by SOEs.  \n \n8.  To  maintain  a  competitive  market  in  general  and  streamline  the  formulation  of  the \ncompetition policy and enforcement of the anti-monopoly law in particular, the Government has \ndecided to address the above issues through the preparation and adoption of an Anti-Monopoly \nLaw and revision of the Law against Unfair Competition within the 5-year term of the 10th NPC \n(2002-2007).  The new competition laws will cover separately the monopoly activities and other \nunfair competition activities, clarify regulatory responsibilities, and set up a regulatory framework \nfor effective implementation of the Anti-Monopoly Law and the amended Law against Unfair \nCompetition. In addition, the legislation  process  will help address  the following important \nconceptual, institutional, and procedural issues. \n \n9.  Core Objective and Possible Conflict with Other Objectives.  Competition policy is \ngenerally  directed  at  enhancing  economic  efficiency  through  the  promotion  of  effective \ncompetition.  To this end, competition policy aims to eliminate or curb producers\u2019 abuse of \ndominant market position and price fixing while reducing barriers to entry.  The result will be \ngreater than consumer welfare and economic efficiency. Consumers will be able to access a \nwider choice of products at lower costs.  Producers get incentives to expand production up to \nthe optimal level.  However, even such a benign policy could at times be at odds with other \nimportant public policy objectives and goals, such as those of trade policy, industrial policy, \nregional development policy, intellectual property policy, science and technology policy, and \nforeign investment policy. As in any other public policies, the gains and losses from competition \npolicy have to be weighed in each particular case. \n \n                                                 \n3  The Provisional Method on Regulating Mergers and Acquisitions of Chinese Enterprises by Foreign Investors was \ndrafted with assistance of ADB-funded TA 3672-PRC: WTO Membership and Foreign Trade Law Reform. (ADB, \nManila. \n4 SETC was dissolved during Government restructuring in March 2003 and the responsibility to ensure market \ncompetition was transferred to the Ministry of Commerce.  \n ", "    3 \n10.  Competition Policy and Law Authority(ies).  Effective discharge of competition policy \nand laws requires an administrative mechanism to implement such policies and laws.  In a \nconstantly evolving market place, the authority(ies) or agency(ies) entrusted with execution of \ncompetition policy and laws must be able to anticipate changes and set rules that address new \ndemands  of  the  marketplace.    It  must  have  powers  to  secure  essential  data  and  other \ninformation on noncompetitive business practices and enforce penalties.  It must be able to \ncoordinate action with other relevant Government agencies.  \n \n11.  Relationship between Anti-Monopoly Law Authority and Sector Regulators.  As a \ngeneral matter, competition laws apply to all sectors and actors in the economy unless specific \nexemptions are granted.  Consequently, an anti-monopoly law impinges on a wide variety of \npublic policies such as trade and industrial policy, privatization and reform of SOEs policy, \nresearch and development policy, regional development policy, and so on. To make competition \nlaws most effective, they must be harmonized with all other policies and regulations that relate \nto them. Where state priorities determine the need for certain exemptions, the priorities have to \nbe identified and the purpose and nature and period of exemptions have to be delineated. Such \na policy-making process involves interaction between the competition policy authority(ies) and \nsector or industry regulators. \n \n12.  Legal  Procedure  and  Role  of  the  Judicial  System.    Once  competition  laws  are \nadopted  and  implementation  agencies  are  designated,  competition  policy  formulation  and \nimplementation will no longer be exclusively kept in the domain of administrative authorities.  \nNongovernment parties will be able to initiate anti-monopoly investigation and seek redress. \nCompetition  laws  will  make  policy  formulation  and  implementation  more  transparent  and \npredictable, and will, by virtue of the administrative litigation procedures in the PRC, subject the \ndecisions of the competition policy and law authorities to contest and challenge in court. The \ndrafters of competition laws need to take into account the legal procedure and role of the judicial \nsystem in the area of competition policy and law, and provide appropriate administrative and \njudicial procedures as well. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n13.  The TA will assist the Government in establishing the legal and regulatory framework for \nformulating  and  implementing  competition  policy  by  preparing  the  Anti-Monopoly  Law  and \namending the Law against Unfair Competition. The major outputs of the TA will be the Anti-\nMonopoly Law and the amendment to the Law against Unfair Competition. The TA framework is \nin Appendix 1.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The general methodology of the TA emphasizes assistance to the Government agencies \nin  their  strategically  important  task  by  exposing  these  agencies  to  the  best  international \nexperience in formulating legislation for competition laws. \n \n15.  The TA will facilitate the legislative process for competition laws through the following \ninputs: \n \n(i)  experts\u2019  review  of  and  comments  on  the  draft  Anti-Monopoly  Law  and  draft \namendment to the Law against Unfair Competition, and providing advice on legal \nand economic theories that underpin anti-monopoly analysis and international ", "4 \nexperience of implementation authorities and regulatory regimes for competition \npolicy and laws;  \n \n(ii)  training  for  Government  staff  involved  in  preparing  and  enforcing  the  Anti-\nMonopoly Law and amendment to the Law against Unfair Competition;  \n \n(iii)  exchange of views and sharing of experiences with competition law authorities of \nthe other countries in the world; and  \n \n(iv)  comparative study of international practices in implementing an anti-monopoly \nlaw.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $795,000 equivalent, of which $413,000 is in \nforeign currency cost and $382,000 equivalent in local currency. ADB will provide $600,000 \nequivalent on a grant basis, financed from ADB\u2019s TA funding program, to finance the total \nforeign currency cost and $187,000 equivalent of the local currency cost.  The TA funds will \nfinance (i) international and domestic consulting services; (ii) cost for resource persons and \nspeakers; (iii) costs of workshops, seminars, and international symposiums; (iv) support for \ndomestic  investigation  workshops;  (v)  external  training;  (vi)  purchase  of  equipment;  (vii) \ncomparative study including collection, translation, and summary of foreign laws, treatises, and \npapers;  and  (viii)  other  administrative  costs  such  as  production  of  reports  and  workshop \nproceedings. The Government will provide $195,000 equivalent as counterpart contribution in \nthe  form  of  counterpart  staff,  conference  venue,  office,  local  communications  and  local \ntransport,  interpretation,  and  general  administration.  The  detailed  breakdown  costs  and \nfinancing plan for the TA is shown in Appendix 2.  \n \n17.  The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has expressed \nstrong interest in cooperating with ADB in providing support to the Government in the area of \ncompetition  policy  and  laws.  It  had  provided  support  in  preparing  the  Anti-Monopoly  Law. \nBecause of its wide-ranging experience, OECD will be able to make valuable contribution in \nkind to the TA, i.e., inputs of expertise of its staff; training facilities based in Seoul, Republic of \nKorea; and networking with the competition policy and law authorities of major economies in the \nworld. A memorandum of understanding will be discussed and entered into by ADB and OECD \nat the initial TA implementation stage to set a framework for cooperation on a parallel basis to \naccomplish the purposes of the TA.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  Services of international consultants (6 person-months) and domestic consultants (8 \nperson-months) will be provided. The international consultants will be experts in competition \npolicy and laws, with various emphases such as international experiences and practices, anti-\nmonopoly law authority, coordination of policy objectives, relationship between the authority(ies) \nto enforce competition laws and sector regulators, and implementation of anti-monopoly law in \nM&A transactions. International and domestic resource persons will be invited to provide expert \ninputs in workshops and symposiums. The outline terms of reference for the consultants and \nresource persons are attached as Appendix 3. Individual international and domestic consultants \nwill be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  selecting  and  engaging  domestic  consultants.  The \nequipment,  to  be  provided  under  the  TA  to  facilitate  the  three  executing  agencies\u2019  (EAs) \nimplementation involving a number of workshops and symposiums, will be procured by the EAs \n ", "    5 \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.  An advance facility will be provided for \nthe equipment, external training, workshops and seminars, and international symposium.  \n \n19.  MOFCOM and LAC will be the EAs for preparing the Anti-Monopoly Law; and SAIC and \nLAC will be the EAs for the draft amendment to the Law against Unfair Competition. Based on \nthe legislation drafting procedure in the PRC, TA implementation will be carried out in two \nphases (Appendix 3). In phase 1, as designated Government agencies for preparing the initial \ndraft of the competition laws, MOFCOM will be responsible for the initial version of the Anti-\nMonopoly Law, and SAIC for the initial draft of revisions to the Law against Unfair Competition.  \nMOFCOM  and SAIC will focus on the objectives, general structure, basic principles, legal \nprocedures,  implementation  authorities,  and  relationship  between  the  competition  law \nauthorities and the sector regulators implementation. In phase 2, LAC will be responsible for \nfinalizing the draft Anti-Monopoly Law and the draft amendment to the Law against Unfair \nCompetition. LAC will be able to more effectively address the general issues in competition laws \nsuch as coordination between the two laws, adjustment of other laws due to the introduction of \nthe Anti-Monopoly Law and the amendment to the Law against Unfair Competition, division of \nroles between the national law and administrative and ministerial regulations, and the role and \nprocedures regarding the judicial system in enforcing competition laws. \n \n20.  A senior official at the vice minister level of each of LAC, MOFCOM, and SAIC will \nprovide overall leadership and guidance in the implementing each relevant TA component.  A \nworking group to be formed in each of LAC, MOFCOM, and SAIC and to be led by a senior \nofficial will be responsible for detailed implementation of the TA. A coordination group of LAC \nand MOFCOM and a coordination group of LAC and SAIC will be set up to coordinate the \nrespective drafting work for the Anti-Monopoly Law and amendment to the Law against Unfair \nCompetition.  MOFCOM, SAIC and LAC will provide the initial and final draft of the Anti-\nMonopoly Law and the amendment to the Law against Unfair Competition to the international \nand domestic consultants and resource persons for their review and comment.  MOFCOM, \nSAIC, and LAC will provide the international consultants with a list of the specific issues for \nwhich  international  expertise  is  needed,  and,  where  necessary,  background  information \nregarding  these  issues.  TA  implementation  is  expected  to  begin  in  January  2005  and  be \ncompleted at the end of December 2006. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n21.
