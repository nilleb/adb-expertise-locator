In support of the efforts of Bangladesh to mitigate in a timely manner the potential \nunemployment risks of the phasing out of the Multi-Fiber Agreement (MFA) quota restrictions, \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) has prepared a technical assistance (TA) to help the \ncountry design and pilot-test interventions to contribute to social protection for female garment \nworkers,  to  facilitate  reemployment  of  those  retrenched  and  develop  options  for  those \nthreatened by retrenchment. The TA concept paper was prepared and endorsed for funding by \nthe Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund Strategy meeting in December 2002. The TA will \ncommence in June 2004. Fact-finding was carried out in November 2003, and agreement was \nreached with the Government on TA objectives, scope, cost estimates, and implementation \narrangements.1 The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n2.  The TA is in line with the various commitments of the Government to reduce poverty, \nincluding the  Poverty  Reduction  Partnership  Agreement with ADB. The TA will be closely \ncoordinated with the ongoing project preparatory TA on Social Protection for Disadvantaged \nWomen and Children.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  After a modest beginning in the late 1970s, the ready-made garment (RMG) industry in \nBangladesh has rapidly expanded to become the country\u2019s engine of growth. During the last \ndecade, garment exports have increased fivefold from Tk43.7 billion to Tk232.5 billion ($4.8 \nbillion) in 2001. Garments\u2019 global export share has increased from 1% to 3%, with the European \nUnion as the major market, followed by the United States. In 2000\u20132001, garment exports \naccounted for 76% of total exports. The labor-intensive RMG industry has not only generated \nneeded foreign exchange but also created jobs for poor Bangladeshi women. As of early 2001 \nBangladesh had around 3,500 garment factories mainly in Dhaka, Chittagong, and some other \nmajor cities and their vicinity, employing an estimated 1.8 million workers, 90% of whom are \nwomen.  The  RMG  sector  is  estimated  to  have  provided  additional  direct  and  indirect \nemployment to 10 million workers in the related industries (e.g., textiles, consumer goods and \nservices, etc.).  \n \n4.  Women\u2019s entry into the labor market is heavily restricted by cultural barriers; limited \nmobility; lack of access to education, skill development opportunities, and productive resources; \nand having to bear all household responsibilities. Significant job creation for women in the \nformal sector by the RMG industry is a major step forward for women\u2019s economic and social \nempowerment.  Most  female  RMG  workers  have  migrated  to  the  cities  from  poor  rural \nhouseholds, mainly districts with high levels of landlessness, and the women\u2019s families have \nbecome increasingly dependent on their remittances. The women\u2019s total monthly income is \nestimated to range from about $12 for cutters to $167 for office staff. Female RMG workers \nhave gained greater control over their personal affairs and decision making in family affairs and \nachieved greater social mobility and independence in spite of harsh working conditions and \nsocial environment.  \n \n5.  For the previous three decades, trade in textile and clothing products has been in a \nmanaged international system of guaranteed allocated quotas under the MFA, which protected \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 4 November 2003. \n2  ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance to the People's Republic of Bangladesh for preparing the Social Protection for \nDisadvantaged Women and Children Project. Manila. A proposed loan of $15 million is included in the Country \nStrategy and Program Update for 2004 as standby. ", "2 \neven inefficient producers. The MFA became part of the World Trade Organization (WTO) \nAgreement on Textile and Clothing, under which a 10-year transition was allowed before the \nphaseout of quotas by the end of 2004. Thus, textile and clothing exporters, largely developing \ncountries, must rapidly become competitive and market their products in response to global \ntrade conditions.  \n \n6.  The RMG sector has sufficient reason to be concerned about the consequences of the \nMFA phaseout. About 25% of Bangladesh\u2019s exports are under quota. During the past decade, \nthe RMG industry met increasing demand and competition by recruiting more unskilled and low-\ncost female workers instead of investing in improved productivity and product quality and value. \nAlthough  the  volume  of  RMG  exports  is  still  increasing,  earnings  are  stagnating  due  to \ncompetition from lower-cost producers. Some garment factories have been closed down and \ntheir workers retrenched, although no accurate statistics exist on these closings. While no \nanalysis exists on whether this unemployment is temporary or long term, evidence suggests that \nretrenchments lead to high turnover in the labor market for garment workers and high transitory \nunemployment.  Given  these  trends,  a  human  resources  and  labor  market  strategy  is \nincreasingly needed for the RMG sector and its workers so that the labor market can adjust to \nthe globalizing market for RMGs. \n \n7.  The  Government,  RMG  industry,  labor  leaders,  and  nongovernment  organizations \n(NGOs) have recently been exploring a business strategy for the industry and its workers. \nStudies have been carried out on its various aspects, including competitiveness, enabling \nenvironment, backward linkages with the textile industry, labor standards, living conditions of \nworkers, and the potential of female labor absorption in other industries. With the support of the \nWorld Bank, the Ministry of Commerce has guided a team of consultants in an extensive study \non the development of a post-MFA business development strategy and provision of TA to the \nRMG  sector.  A  task  force  on  RMG  dynamic  growth  is  being  established  to  consider  14 \nrecommendations developed under the RMG sector study as well as six pilot projects on \nbackward production linkages. The Government and some NGOs, with external funding agency \nsupport,3 have provided ad hoc assistance to RMG workers.  \n \n8.  While  the  RMG  industry  has  been  much  discussed  and  analyzed,  and  alternative \nindustries explored, the effect of the MFA phaseout on workers has been little assessed or its \nsocial and human impact addressed, especially on gender. The TA will develop and test various \napproaches to providing opportunities and protection for workers that have been retrenched or \nare threatened by retrenchment. The key problem, which the TA will address, is that although \nthe possible impacts of the end of the MFA have been discussed, little has been done to \nestimate the impact on human resources, including the development of a system to identify \nretrenched  garment  workers,  and  to  design  possible  social  protection  and  reemployment \nmeasures. The Government and industry must work closely together to minimize and mitigate \njob losses after the MFA phaseout, and create jobs and safety nets for those who have lost or \nmay  lose  their  jobs.  Reemployment  support  to  those  already  retrenched,  either  for  self-\nemployment  in  the  RMG  or  other  industries,  also  needs  urgent  attention.  The  project \npreparatory TA for Social Protection for Disadvantaged Women and Children is, inter alia, \nhelping the Government develop social protection measures for poor women, including workers. \nSuccessful approaches piloted by this TA will be considered for inclusion in the proposed loan \nproject.  \n \n                                                 \n3  Such assistance includes reproductive health education and services, functional literacy, gender and labor rights \neducation, alliance building, a media campaign, improvement of labor standards, fire monitoring, shelter support, \nand research support. NGOs have provided skill training and microfinance support for retrenched workers.  ", "    3 \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n9.  The overall objective of the TA is to help the country reduce poverty of RMG sector \nemployees in a sustainable manner. The purpose is to reduce unemployment risks associated \nwith the MFA phaseout and to improve job opportunities for female garment workers.  \n \n10.  The TA will produce four major outputs: (i) a strategic report on possible approaches for \npost-MFA human-capacity development, employment, and social protection measures; (ii) pilot \nprojects to benefit female garment workers; (iii) exchange of experiences;4 and (iv) identification \nand documentation of lessons learned from the pilot projects, and scaling up of potentials. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  The TA will build upon ongoing stakeholder activities to improve the RMG sector\u2019s \ncompetitiveness. Various pilot activities will be carried out through the private sector and NGO \npartners. The TA will have five key components and two phases. \n \n12.  Component 1: Strategy for Garment Workers.  This will comprise the following: (i) \ncollection,  analysis,  verification,  and  synthesis  of  documents,  data,  and  information;  (ii) \nstakeholder interviews and focus group discussions with the target groups and development of \nmethods to track the target group (retrenched women having difficulty finding a job but with \npotential  for  further  training);  (iii)  elaboration  of  a  clear  vision  about  training  needs  and \ndemands; (iv) identification of potential employers; (v) elaboration of a set of post-MFA labor \nmarket and employment scenarios and strategies for workers; (vi) elaboration  of  possible \nmeasures in job creation, training and retraining, and social protection; (vii) identification of \nimplementing partners to, for example, identify and secure the participating enterprises; identify \ntheir specific training needs; and establish links with and subcontract needed training to various \ntraining  providers  (government,  NGOs,  and  private  sector  partners)  in  functional  literacy, \nmotivational education, technical skill training, and others as necessary; (viii) identification of \nnecessary steps for scale-up (to cover the whole sector) and sustainability of services; and (ix) \nelaboration of terms of reference and detailed cost estimates for NGOs to be contracted under \ncomponents 2, 3, and 4. \n \n13.  Component 2: Labor Market Pilot Programs. Based on the outcomes of component 1, \nthis  component  will  carry  out  different  types  of  women-friendly  labor  market  programs  to \nfacilitate reemployment and social protection of retrenched RMG workers:  \n \n(i)  Comprehensive reemployment support to retrenched female RMG workers. \nTarget retrenched women RMG workers and help them earn through different \nchannels such as self-employment, microenterprise development, and linkage to \nenterprises  willing  to  hire  retrenched  RMG  workers  after  training  (e.g., \nagroprocessing, information technology, and RMG).  \n(ii)   Labor information exchange. Link supply with demand for labor through easy \naccessible information for women  job  seekers,  including  retrenched  garment \nworkers. Light industry and service sector employers (not only RMG but also, \n                                                 \n4 ADB is financing a similar TA in Cambodia (ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Cambonia for \nPreventing Poverty and Empowering Female Garment Workers Affected by the Changing International Trade \nEnvironment. Manila. [CAM 4131].) This TA also has an exchange component, under which experiences of the two \nprojects will be shared. ", "4 \ne.g., knitwear, textile, pharmaceutical, food-processing, and other light industries) \ncould  publish  job  vacancies  in  a  job  information  system  administered  by  a \nbusiness association with an extensive network. The TA could also test reference \nletters from factories to be issued to retrenched workers, and find employers \ninterested in providing internships to retrenched RMG workers. \n \n14.  Component  3:  Social  Protection5  Pilot  Programs.  Based  on  the  outcome  of \ncomponent 1, this component will test different types of social assistance that could be scaled \nup: \n \n(i)   Shelter support. Ensure worker safety and reduce their vulnerability by helping \nthe ongoing shelter programs supported by NGOs, and develop a proposal for a \nfinancially viable and sustainable shelter and food program for female workers \nduring retraining.  \n(ii)   Micro and group insurance or saving, discretionary fund. Study, and consult \nwith the private sector to explore, the potential of such schemes among RMG \nand other industrial workers.  \n \n15.  Component 4: Identification and Documentation of Lessons Learned and Potential \nfor Scale-Up. Toward the end of the TA, a local external research institute/consultant will be \nengaged  to  (i)  evaluate  the  lessons  learned,  progress  made  in  reemployment  and  social \nprotection of female garment workers, and requirement for design change, if any; and (ii) \ndiscuss scale-up potential of the pilot programs with the Government and stakeholders in a \nworkshop. \n \n16.  Component 5: Exchange.  Toward the end of the TA, the findings of the evaluation \n(component 4) will be shared with the key stakeholders in a national workshop, and further \nfollow-up actions will be considered.  \n \n17.  The Project will have two phases. Phase 1 (5 months) will cover component 1 and \nrequire the services of an international consultant and three local consultants. Phase 2 (19 \nmonths) will require a TA implementation unit with a full-time national consultant (who will \noverlap 1 month with phase 1), which will be responsible for overall management, provide \noverall monitoring of the pilot programs, and consider opportunities for potential scale-up.  \n \n18.  Certain risks are associated with this TA, especially to identify the retrenched workers, \nand to ensure sustainability of the services and measures tested in the pilot projects. To \nminimize the risk, from the beginning the garment industry (employers and trade unions) and \nthe Government will cooperate closely. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n19.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $525,000 equivalent, of which $141,000 will be \nforeign  currency  costs,  and  $384,000  equivalent  local  currency  costs.  ADB  will  finance \n$420,000 equivalent, which includes the entire foreign currency costs and $279,000 equivalent \nin  local  currency  costs.  The  remaining  $105,000  equivalent  will  be  contributed  by  the \nGovernment  and  will  include  office  accommodation,  counterpart  staff  remuneration,  and \nmiscellaneous administration costs. The TA is proposed to be financed by ADB on a grant basis \n                                                 \n5  Social protection is defined as the set of policies and programs designed to reduce poverty and vulnerability by \npromoting efficient labor markets, diminishing people's exposure to risks, and enhancing their capacity to protect \nthemselves against hazards and interruption/loss of income.

The TA will last 24 months, from June 2004 to May 2006. The Executing Agency of the \nTA will be the Ministry for Women and Children Affairs (MOWCA). A TA steering committee, \nchaired by MOWCA and comprising the ministries of commerce, labor and employment, social \nwelfare, textiles, and finance, will be established to meet quarterly to provide overall guidance to \nthe TA. NGOs, garment industry employers and trade unions, and other involved agencies may \nbe invited as necessary. The TA will be closely coordinated with the Bureau of Manpower, \nEmployment and Training. A TA implementation unit will be located at MOWCA to provide office \nsupport. The unit will hold regular information exchange meetings among the pilot program \npartners. \n \n21.  The TA will require a total of 30 person-months of consulting services: (i) phase 1\u2014one \ninternational human resources development and gender specialist and team leader (5 person-\nmonths), and three domestic consultants: a social protection specialist (2 person-months), a \nfinancial analyst (1 person-month), and a labor market economist (1 person-month); and (ii) \nphase 2: a national project manager for the entire phase 2, and who will overlap 1 month with \nphase 1 (20 person-months). Phase 2 will also have funds for lump-sum contracts with local \nNGOs and partners for training and other services developed in phase 1 (component 2), as well \nas for service delivery (component 3). At the end of phase 2 a local research institute or \nconsultant will be hired (1 person-month) to evaluate and identify scale-up potentials. \n \n22.  All consultants will be hired through a consulting firm. The firm and NGOs will be \nengaged by ADB in accordance with its  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. The quality and \ncost-based selection method will be used. The outline terms of reference for the consultants are \nin Appendix 3. Some office equipment for the TA implementation unit (a computer with software \nand a printer) will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \n \nIV.
