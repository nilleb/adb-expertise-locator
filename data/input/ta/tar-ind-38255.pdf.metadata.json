This project preparatory technical assistance (TA) is included in the country strategy and \nprogram update for 2005\u20132007 under the 2005 technical assistance program and 2006 lending \nprogram of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for India.1 The Fact-Finding Mission visited \nIndia from 7 to 15 February 2005, and reached an understanding with the Government of India \nregarding  the  goals,  outputs,  activities,  implementing  and  financing  arrangements,  and \ncounterpart support as outlined in the preliminary design and monitoring framework in Appendix \n1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The 54,000 square-kilometer state of Uttaranchal was created as the 27th state of India \nby bifurcating the state of Uttar Pradesh in November 2000. Over 90% of its terrain is hilly with \nthe highest point reaching 7,817 meters, and 62% is forest covered. Over 60% of its total \npopulation of about 8.5 million live in rural areas. Although 90% of the population are employed \nor engaged in agriculture or related commerce, tourism is the mainstay of the economy and has \ncontributed much to the 5% annual growth of the state\u2019s gross domestic product since its \ncreation. In 2004, nearly 13 million tourists visited its 178 designated tourist places, and 12 \nparks and sanctuaries. The state government of Uttaranchal (SGOU) has already undertaken \nseveral  initiatives  aimed  at  increasing  the  annual  growth  of  tourist  arrivals  to  12%3  and \nachieving its development targets4 (Appendix 2). However, inadequate and inefficient inter- and \nintra-state freight and passenger transportation systems are limiting the effectiveness of those \ninitiatives. \n \n3.  At present, air services to and from the state are low in frequency and reliability. The four \nrailheads within the state are connected via Uttar Pradesh to the national rail network, but they \nare not connected by road or rail within the state to offer intermodal or multimodal freight and \npassenger services in Uttaranchal. Road transport is the predominant mode, with 80% share of \nthe passenger and freight traffic market the number of vehicles in the state has been growing at \nan average of about 15% every year since 2000. Yet, nearly 6,000 villages comprised of about \n20,000 hamlets lack an all-weather connection to a main thoroughfare.  \n \n4.  The Public Works Department (PWD) of SGOU manages the primary road network \ncomprising 1,327 kilometers (km) of national highways, 418 km of state highways, and various \ntypes of district and village roads totaling 17,791 km.5 It is responsible for planning, designing, \nconstructing, and maintaining the network elements classified as state, district, and village \nroads. With the exception of routine maintenance, road works are outsourced on a competitive \nbasis. However, only about 7% of the roads in the state are built to two-lane standards, and \n50% are paved. About 1/3 of the higher class paved roads are in poor condition, and over 70% \nof the roads for light vehicles need to be repaired or rehabilitated.  \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB 2004. Country Strategy and Program Update (2005\u20132007): India. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 1 March 2005.  \n3  Average annual growth between 2001 and 2003 was approximately 8%. \n4  Double per capita income in the next 10 years, reduce population below the poverty line by half, arrest migration of \nthe working group by providing employment opportunities, and provide electricity and drinking water to all.  \n5  Additionally, there are 14,634 km administered by local authorities, and state and central agencies, including 1,180 \nkm administered by the Border Roads Organization (BRO) and 3,358 km of forests roads.  \n ", "2   \n5.  Although PWD\u2019s annual budget, allocated entirely from the state budget, was Rs1.7 \nbillion (about $40 million) in 2003\u20132004 and has been growing at an annual rate of over 10% \nsince 2000, expenditure on maintenance was approximately Rs380 million ($9 million)6 while \nRs1.3 billion ($30 million) was spent on capital improvements. Despite the 10,000+ workforce, \nless than half the planned maintenance activities for that period were completed due to lack of \nfunds and low output levels associated with labor-intensive methods.  \n \n6.  The long-term goal of SGOU is to connect every village, town, and city to local economic \ncenters, social services, and major cities in the state, and to one another through a network of \nall-weather roads and pedestrian links. To meet that goal, PWD is currently preparing a state \nroad development master plan, covering about 3,000 km of state and other district roads as well \nas 13,000 km of village and lower class roads. The master plan is expected to outline road \nimprovements, and their economic, social, and environmental viabilities as well as the resource \nrequirements in the next 10 years. SGOU also wants PWD to increase road asset performance \nand agency productivity by (i) adopting advanced construction methods and material more \nsuited to the local terrain and climatic conditions and (ii) improving contact administration and \naccounting methods. At present, PWD\u2019s capacity is constrained externally by administrative and \nfinancial rules, and internally by archaic operating procedures. Additionally, PWD staff are \ninsufficiently trained to utilize state-of-the art techniques, particularly of resource allocation and \ncontract administration.  \n \n7.  To mobilize additional public and private resources needed to implement the master \nplan, SGOU has set up a dedicated infrastructure development fund and a Board to guide the \ninvestment. It has also been increasing the annual state budget allocation to PWD since 2000. \nMoreover, following the success of developing the central bus terminal in Dehradun as a public-\nprivate partnership, PWD has commissioned a study to examine the feasibility of developing \nabout 300 km of selected state road corridors with the participation of the private sector in \nconstruction, maintenance, and management. Though limited in scale, a few examples of the \n\u201cuser-pays\u201d  principle  applied  to  bridges  along  state  and  district  roads  already  exist  in \nUttaranchal.  \n \n8.  The loan project to be prepared under the TA is in accordance with ADB\u2019s recent state \nroads development initiatives and strategy aimed at strengthening rural-urban connections and \nlinking poor rural producers to markets in towns, cities, and ports; and increasing the capacity of \nstate agencies to better manage roads. It will be a sector loan, designed to increase the quality \nand quantity of the state\u2019s road assets, and Uttaranchal PWD\u2019s capacity to better manage them. \nTo avoid possible pitfalls, lessons learned from recent ADB- and World Bank-financed road \ndevelopment  projects  will  be  considered  when  designing  and  staging  organizational  and \nprocess revisions. In particular, ADB\u2019s and the World Bank\u2019s past support for India\u2019s road sector \ndevelopment targeted at developing institutions\u2019 capacities will be closely studied to understand \nthe critical issues.  \n \n                                                 \n6  This amount includes Rs2.2 million for repair of damage due to landslides and Rs4.1 million for maintenance of \nchronic slip zones. \n \n ", "  3\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  Uttaranchal\u2019s PWD is currently preparing a 10-year road master plan (a road network \ndevelopment  proposal)  and  financing  plan  outlining  short-,  medium-,  and  long-term \ndevelopment projects and the corresponding resource requirements. It is also preparing a \nsample  (core  set)  of  the  short-term  development  projects  to  be  undertaken  with  possible \nfinancing from ADB. The purpose of the TA is to help Uttaranchal PWD (i) review and finalize \nthe master plan and the sample projects, (ii) review and optimize the financing plan, and (iii) \nprepare a plan to enhance PWD\u2019s capacity. The TA will have three principal outputs: (i) a road \nmaster plan outlining the development stages for key state, district, and village roads that would \nprovide  the  personal  mobility  and  market  accessibility  needed  to  achieve  the  state\u2019s \ndevelopment goals; (ii) a financing plan outlining the resource requirements and alternative \nfinancing arrangements for implementing the road master plan; (iii) preliminary designs of the \nsample road projects, which are economically, socially, environmentally, and technically feasible \nand meet all relevant safeguards; and (iv) a plan to develop the capacity of Uttaranchal PWD to \nincrease and sustain the performance of road assets in the long term. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  In the case of the master plan, the consultants will review and, if necessary, revise and \nfinalize the priority links, improvement options, implementation schedule (development stages), \nand the preliminary designs of the first-stage (stage 1) projects, which will be the critical network \nlinks identified for improvement with possible financing from ADB. In the case of the investment \nplan, the consultants will review, revise, and/or modify and finalize the financing needs and the \nmost appropriate financing arrangements to realize the master plan.  \n \n11.  In finalizing the master plan, the consultants will review the prioritization criteria and \nmethodology to ensure that stage 1 projects support the economic and population growth trends \nand the state\u2019s development plans, and that the master plan will increase the overall efficiency \nof inter- and intra-state freight and passenger transport. In particular, the TA consultants will \nensure that stage 1 will lead to the desired level of connectivity in the short term (2\u20134 years) by \nmaking appropriate revisions and amendments where necessary to the PWD\u2019s master plan. The \nsample of stage 1 investment projects will be reviewed and revised, if necessary, in accordance \nwith social, environmental, and economic standards set out in the relevant reference documents \npublished  by  ADB  as  well  as  ADB\u2019s  transport  sector  strategy  for  India  and  the  state\u2019s \ndevelopment targets. The financial sustainability of stage 1 projects will be assessed in relation \nto the forecast maintenance and operating costs and the anticipated levels of funding. The \nconsultants will carefully review each sample project to ensure compliance with ADB's policy on \ninvoluntary resettlement and relevant policies on the minorities or indigenous persons. The TA \nconsultants will review the terms of reference for supervision of construction to ensure that all \nsafeguards are met during implementation. \n \n12.  Activities under the capacity development component will focus on the regulations and \npractices of Uttaranchal PWD that affect road asset performance. The consultants will interview \nkey stakeholders, including PWD staff in and out of state, and review the findings of previous \nstudies by the Government of India, ADB, and funding agencies to determine opportunities for \nand threats to increased road sector productivity. Based on the information compiled, the TA \nconsultants will prepare alternative productivity improvement strategies under different human \nand capital resources, economic growth, and other relevant scenarios, and perform detailed \n ", "4   \nbenefit-cost analyses to arrive at an optimal strategy (a time-bound capacity development and \nfinancing plan). The strategy will comprise administrative, financial, and legislative revisions as \nwell as staff training needed to reach national and international road sector productivity targets. \nAdditionally, the consultants will prepare terms of reference for supervising the implementation \nof the strategy. \n \n13.   For the chosen strategy, the consultants will provide short training courses for PWD staff \nas an intermediate capacity enhancement measure. The training will be in, but will not be limited \nto, contract administration, project management, information technology, road construction and \nmaintenance (especially in mountainous terrain), or any other area considered important by the \nmajority of the stakeholders. If necessary, training will also be provided in project preparation, \nusing the sample projects in stage 1 of the master plan as case studies. The training program \nwill be tailor-made to suit local needs, include hands-on exercises, and be packaged and \nsequenced to permit staff from all parts of the state to participate. The consultants will also \ndevelop a scheme for evaluating training effectiveness and continuing the training for a period of \nup to 5 years after completion of the TA.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at about $463,000 equivalent including a foreign \nexchange component of $204,000 and a local cost component of $259,000 equivalent. ADB will \nprovide up to $368,000 on a grant basis from its technical assistance funding program to cover \nall foreign exchange costs and $164,000 equivalent of local currency costs. SGOU will provide \n$95,000 equivalent in local currency to finance office space, data collection, and counterpart \nstaff. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3. The Government has \nbeen informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  Uttaranchal PWD will serve as the Executing Agency for the TA. PWD will appoint a \nproject director who will be responsible for administering the TA, which includes supervising the \nwork of the consultants, liaising between the consultant team and other concerned agencies, \ncoordinating with ADB, and reporting. The project director will be assisted by full-time staff \nnominated by PWD that will serve as counterparts of the consultants in the following areas:      \n(i)  road  design  and  pavement  management,  (ii)  social  and  poverty  assessment,                       \n(iii) environmental assessment, (iv) accounting and auditing, and (v) procurement and contract \nadministration. To facilitate technology transfer, counterpart staff, sourced primarily from PWD \nand relevant government agencies, will work alongside the TA consultants. \n \n16.  To facilitate timely implementation and successful completion of the TA, SGOU has \nagreed to provide the following: (i) the long-term network development plan (a 10-year road \nmaster plan) based on a detailed review of the condition and function of the entire network \ncomprising state and other categories of roads under the jurisdiction of Uttaranchal PWD. Stage \n1 of the master plan will comprise new links or improvements to existing links needed to support \nexpected economic and population growth patterns and the state\u2019s development plans; (ii) an \ninvestment plan outlining the financing needs and the most appropriate financing arrangements \nto realize the development plan; (iii) preliminary designs for the set of stage 1 projects that \ncomply with all ADB and national social, environmental, and economic standards, including \naccompanying  documentation  such  as  resettlement  plans,  environmental  reports,  etc.,  if \nnecessary; (iv) reports and other material collected and used in the detailed project study \nperformed by PWD\u2019s consultants; (v) assistance to the international consultants with securing \n ", "  5\nvisas, customs clearances, and other permits to enable them to perform the tasks specified in \nthe terms of reference; and (vi) office space with all utilities (water, power, heating, etc.) in \nDehradun  with  appropriate  furniture  (desks,  chairs,  couches,  cabinets,  shelves),  including \naccess (telephone lines) to international telecommunication, Internet/data. The consultants will \npay the cost of telecommunication and Internet/data services. \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented as two concurrent components over a period of 5 months \ncommencing in September 2005. PWD will form a project steering committee (PSC), which will \nbe chaired by the secretary in charge of Uttaranchal PWD or his representative and will include \nrepresentatives  from  relevant  agencies  such  as  Finance  Department,  Law  Department, \nTransport Department, chamber of commerce, road transport providers, and nongovernment \norganizations  representing  the  interest  of  project  area  residents,  etc.  PSC  members  will \nsupervise and monitor the technical outputs of the work and will meet at least twice during \nimplementation. \n \n18.  The TA will require 23 person-months of consulting services (8 international and 15 \ndomestic inputs). The internationally recruited consultants will include (i) an institutional reform \nspecialist and (ii) a transport planner/economist. The domestic consultants will include (i) a \nhighway engineer, (ii) an environmental/resettlement specialist, and (iii) a social development \nand poverty specialist with experience in assessing impacts on indigenous peoples and ethnic \nminorities. An outline of the terms of reference for the consultants is given in Appendix 4. The \nconsultants will be engaged by ADB on an individual basis according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants, and other arrangements acceptable to ADB for engaging domestic \nconsultants.  \n \nIV.
