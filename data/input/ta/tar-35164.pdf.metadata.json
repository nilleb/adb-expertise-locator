", " \nI.  INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of the Philippines has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nprovide advisory technical assistance (TA) to the Metro Manila solid waste management (SWM) \nsystem. A Fact-Finding Mission visited the Philippines during October and November 2001 to \nformulate the TA. The Mission held discussions with the Government, including officials of the \nDepartment  of  Environment  and  Natural  Resources  (DENR),  Department  of  Health  (DOH), \nNational Economic Development Authority, Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA), local \ngovernment units (LGUs), and other stakeholders, and reached an understanding with DENR on \nthe scope, terms of reference, cost estimates, financing plan, and implementation arrangements \nfor the TA.1 \nII.  ISSUES OR PROBLEMS \n2.  There is an urgent and critical need to address the current SWM situation in Metro Manila. \nDue to the forced closure of the two primary disposal facilities, the metropolitan area has been \nwithout adequate and environmentally safe waste disposal mechanisms. Compounded by weak \ninstitutional and technical capacity to plan and respond appropriately, the SWM sector is in crisis. \nThe resulting impacts are significant and immediate: An estimated 6,000 tons per day of refuse is \nbeing diverted to uncontrolled open municipal dumpsites, burned illegally, or dumped within vacant \nland  areas  and  waterways  in  Metro  Manila  and  neighboring  provinces.  The  Government  is \nimplementing  interim  (controlled  dumpsite)  and  long-term  (sanitary  landfill)  facilities;  however, \ncomplex technical, legal, siting, and community acceptance issues need to be addressed. \n3.  The situation has potentially severe and widespread public health, environmental, and \neconomic consequences, and represents a considerable threat to human receptors and the natural \nand constructed environments of Metro Manila. Public health risks are of immediate concern, \nparticularly vermin infestation and the spread of disease due to increased human exposure to \ndecomposing waste. Risks are severe in communities that suffer the presence of open dumps and \nof  illegal  and  improper  disposal.  The  urban  poor  are  particularly  susceptible,  due  to  their \nheightened exposure to decomposing waste in high-density environments. Significant air pollution \nalso results from the burning of solid waste. Current practices also pose significant longer-term \nthreats. Future health and environmental remediation will be complex and costly. \n4.  Medical  waste2  management  presents  additional  challenges.  Only  a  portion  of  the \nestimated 12 tons of medical waste generated daily in Metro Manila\u2019s 713 hospitals and clinics is \nproperly disposed of, and a significant proportion finds its way into the municipal waste stream. \nMedical waste management requires carefully designed systems to ensure occupational and public \nhealth, and a high level of awareness and training of involved personnel. Preliminary studies \ncompleted recently by the World Health Organization (WHO) conclude that existing systems and \npersonnel skill levels for handling, treating, and disposing of medical waste vary widely.3 While \nseveral private sector facilities and numerous small-scale hospital incinerators are in operation, few \ncontrols are in place, and improvements are necessary to ensure proper waste management, and \nto address the impending prohibition of incineration technologies as mandated under the Clean Air \nAct.4 \n5.  Metro Manila SWM is characterized by collection and transfer by 10-wheel trucks and \ndisposal in controlled and uncontrolled open dumpsites. Waste segregation and recycling are \nperformed largely by the informal sector, and through community-based programs at the barangay \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in October 2001. \n2  Medical waste includes pathological, infectious, hazardous, toxic, and low-level radioactive wastes. Health care waste, \nas defined by DOH, include general waste. The TA will focus on the segregation of health care waste and appropriate \nmanagement of medical waste. \n3  Preliminary studies in hospital waste management, WHO (January-March 2001). \n4  The current deadline on the use of incineration is mid-2003. ", "  2   \nlevel. Institutionally, LGUs are responsible for waste collection and transfer within their jurisdictions. \nMMDA  is  responsible  for  waste  disposal.  Until  recently,  it  operated  the  two  major  municipal \ndumpsites serving Metro Manila. In addition, several other dumpsites are owned and operated by \nthe  private  sector  and  by  individual  LGUs.  DENR  is  responsible  primarily  for  regulatory \nenforcement of the sector, with DOH, the Department of Public Works and Highways, LGUs, and \nother  agencies  performing  specific  regulatory  functions.  DENR\u2019s  Environmental  Management \nBureau serves as the secretariat of the National Solid Waste Management Commission (NSWMC), \nwhich  was  recently  established  by  Republic  Act  (RA)  9003,  the  Ecological  Solid  Waste \nManagement Act. The Secretary of DENR chairs NSWMC. \n6.  Waste disposal is further affected by constraints in the siting, planning, and development of \nemergency,  interim,  and  long-term  facilities.  Legal  challenges  and  opposition  from  host \ncommunities and environmentalists have resulted in many initiatives being delayed or curtailed. \nThe  activities  of  LGUs  are  of  varying  quality  and  appropriateness.  The  lack  of  established \nregulatory-based  technical  evaluation  guidelines  and  facility  standards  hinders  the  objective \nevaluation  of  proposed  SWM  options.  The  SWM  subsector  is  further  complicated  by  (i) \nunacceptable  governance  and  corrupt  practices;  (ii)  failure  to  properly  design,  operate,  and \nmaintain disposal facilities; and (iii) lack of enforcement of environmental regulations. Clearly, there \nhave also been deficiencies in leadership. \n7.  A major accomplishment has been the passage of RA 9003, key elements of which include \n(i) establishment of a National Ecology Center to provide information, training, and networking \nservices concerning SWM; (ii) mandatory segregation and recycling of solid waste at the barangay \nlevel; (iii) formation of SWM boards at the provincial, city, and municipality levels;5 and (iv) forming \nmultipurpose  environment  cooperatives  in  every  LGU.  NSWMC  is  tasked  with  developing  a \nnational SWM status report and framework, LGUs are required to formulate 10-year SWM plans; \ndivert  25  percent  of  all  solid  waste  through  reuse,  recycling,  and  composting;  and  establish \nreclamation  and  buy-back  centers  for  recyclables.  At  the  barangay  level,  materials  recovery \nfacilities (MRFs) are to be established for final sorting, segregation, composting, and recycling, with \nresidual wastes to be transferred to a sanitary landfill or other long-term facility. NSWMC, MMDA, \nand LGUs have stated a need for TA to support the implementation of RA 9003, with a focus on \nthe Metro Manila situation. \n8.  The Act, if implemented successfully, will help alleviate the metro-wide crisis and build a \nframework for longer-term solutions. NSWMC would benefit from TA to help formulate the required \nstatus reports, framework, and information database; and to assist in the provision of training, \nguidance,  and  support  to  LGUs.  LGUs  require  assistance  to  establish  their  respective  SWM \nboards,  formulate  SWM  plans,  and  plan  and  implement  MRFs  at  the  community  level  in \npartnership with nongovernment organizations (NGOs) and the private sector. Scope exists for \nfocused and flexible advisory TA to develop model SWM projects and plans for LGUs, and to pilot \ntest innovations for replication and scaling up. \n9.  The SWM subsector is being assisted by other international aid agencies. The United \nNations  Development  Programme  (UNDP)  is  set  to  undertake  a  project  with  MMDA  to  pilot \ncommunity-based  solid  waste  management  (CBSWM)  initiatives  in  Metro  Manila.  US-Asia \nEnvironmental Partnership is initiating a program to fund NGOs involved in CBSWM. The Japan \nInternational  Cooperation  Agency  (JICA)  undertook  a  comprehensive  SWM  study  in  1999;6 \nhowever its recommendations have been overtaken by the premature closure of existing sanitary \nlandfill  facilities  and  the  banning  of  incineration.  The  World  Bank  Solid  Waste  Ecological \nEnhancement Project (2001) covered provincial areas. The proposed TA will recognize this earlier \nwork by taking an integrated approach for long-term solutions, providing advice on interim solutions \nand emerging issues, targeting assistance at the LGU level, and facilitating aid coordination. It will \nalso include important capacity building for NSWMC, MMDA, other agencies, and LGUs. \n                                                 \n5  MMDA chairs the provincial SWM board for Metro Manila. \n6  JICA Study on Solid Waste Management for Metro Manila (1999). ", "  3   \n10.  Lessons learned by the Government and external funding agencies from previous practices \nand  interventions  include  the  need  for  (i)  adequate  involvement  and  compensation  of  host \ncommunities; (ii) adequate planning, design, construction, operation, and maintenance of the entire \nsystem; (iii) improved governance and leadership; (iv) independent and regulatory-based guidance \nand technical standards to evaluate, plan, design, and operate facilities; and (v) proper planning \nand implementation of devolved responsibilities. \n11.  The TA will respond directly to both the urgency and the opportunities by addressing key \npolicy; institutional; technical; and information, education, and communication needs. It will provide \nimmediate \u201con the ground\u201d assistance to respond effectively to emerging issues and support the \nimplementation of RA 9003, while concurrently developing data, providing planning assistance, \nand  building  capacity  of  NSWMC,  concerned  agencies,  and  LGUs  to  achieve  sustainable \nsolutions. The TA will provide sector analysis, advisory assistance, and opportunities to lay the \nfoundation  for  expeditious  investment  programs.  ADB\u2019s  emerging  strategy  to  provide  sector \nassistance during this time of crisis and for the longer term includes sector coordination and \nleadership, independent advisory assistance, and facilitation of resource mobilization. The TA will \ninitiate this strategic role for ADB.  \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n12.  The main objectives of the TA are overall improvements in Metro Manila solid and medical \nwaste management for increased environmental quality and public health. The TA will provide \nplanning, design, training, and other assistance to develop and strengthen an integrated SWM \nsystem. Specifically, it will include (i) supporting and strengthening LGU SWM systems, including \nCBSWM, as required by RA 9003; (ii) improving medical waste management; (iii) capacity building \nfor NSWMC, MMDA, other agencies, and LGUs; and (iv) assistance to support efforts to resolve \ninterim  and  long-term  disposal  needs.  The  TA  is  designed  to  process  subsector  activities \nconcurrently, and to be flexible to respond rapidly and effectively to emerging conditions. The TA \nwill also include provision for additional technical experts on an as-needed basis to supplement \nassociated TA activities. The TA framework is given in Appendix 1. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The TA includes sector-wide interventions and closely integrated specialist assistance in \nspecific areas of the SWM sector. Sector-wide tasks will support specific interventions as follows: 7 \n14.  Component A: Capacity Building and RA 9003 Implementation Support to Selected \nMetro  Manila  LGUs.  This  component  will  directly  assist  selected  LGUs  in  Metro  Manila  in \nimplementing the provisions of the Act, to include formulating LGU SWM plans; providing advice in \ndesigning, establishing, and sustaining MRFs and reclamation and buy-back centers in partnership \nwith  private  sector  contractors;  strengthening  institutional  structures  for  improved  SWM;  and \nproviding advice to enhance enforcement. Advisory technical services will be provided to selected \nLGUs, which will be selected on a competitive basis, to develop 10-year SWM plans; integrate the \nplans and strategies of the city\u2019s respective barangays into the plan; adopt specific revenue-\ngenerating measures; review proposals for NGO and private sector participation in the collecting, \ntransfer, storage, processing, recycling, and disposal of municipal waste; assist in the setting up of \nmultipurpose  environment  cooperatives;  and  the  review,  monitoring,  and  providing  advisory \nassistance on the enforcement of LGU-wide and barangay-level SWM systems.

Component E: Specialist Consultant Support. This will provide a facility for access to \nspecialized expertise on an as-needed basis to support the other components. Specialty areas will \ninclude, but not be limited to, risk assessment, environmental toxicology, risk communication, \nchemical engineering, and hydrogeology. \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n19.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $1,800,000  equivalent,  comprising  $735,000  in  foreign \nexchange costs and $1,065,000 equivalent in local currency costs. ADB will provide $1,250,000 \nequivalent  to  finance  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $515,000  equivalent  of  the  local \ncurrency cost. The TA will be financed by ADB on a grant basis from the Asian Currency Crisis \nSupport Facility funded by the Government of Japan. The Government has agreed to provide the \nbalance of the local currency cost, equivalent to $550,000, in kind for counterpart staff, office ", "  5   \nspace, furniture, administrative support, services, and logistics. Details of the cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are given in Appendix 2.  \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  As the chair of NSWMC, DENR will be the executing agency for the TA, with DOH as an \nadditional implementing agency. These agencies will execute a memorandum of agreement that \nclearly  delineates  the  responsibilities  of  each  organization.  DENR  and  DOH  will  provide \ncounterpart staff and facilities to support the TA consultants. A steering committee chaired by the \nsecretary of DENR and including representatives NSWMC and the Office of the President will be \nformed to provide guidance and support to the TA.8 The steering committee will meet at least \nquarterly. DENR will provide a suitably furnished office with utilities and telecommunication access, \ntransport  for  the  consultants,  and  materials  and  documentation  required  by  the  TA.  The  TA \nequipment will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and will be \ntransferred to DENR upon completion of the TA. \n21.  A  firm  of  international  consultants,  in  association  with  domestic  consultants,  will  be \nengaged. The TA will require approximately 30 person-months of international and 40 person-\nmonths of domestic consulting services from the firm. The consultants will have expertise in SWM, \neconomic  and  financial  analysis/management,  community  relations,  media  relations  and \nproduction,  web  site  and  database  management,  medical  waste  management,  environmental \nplanning and design, social impact assessment, and institutional and organizational development. \nThe consultant team will include a sector advisor, separate and distinct from the team leader, who \nwill  be  responsible  for  providing  advice,  coordination,  and  direction  for  sector  development \nactivities. A specific contingency item of approximately three person-months of consulting services \nwill be provided for the specialist consultant support component. Outline terms of reference for the \nTA consultants are in Appendix 3. In view of the need to expedite consultant selection, advance \naction has been taken to recruit consultants on a noncommittal basis in accordance with ADB \nprocedures.9  Other  domestic  consultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  procedures \nacceptable to ADB. \n22.
