THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Enhancing Public\u2013Private Partnerships in Punjab Project. \nThe report also describes (i) the proposed administration of a grant, and (ii) the proposed \nadministration of technical assistance (TA) for Enhancing Public\u2013Private Partnerships in Punjab, \nboth to be provided by the Government of the United Kingdom for the Enhancing Public\u2013Private \nPartnerships in Punjab Project, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the \nauthority delegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the grant and the TA. \n \n2.  The Government of Punjab (GOPb), through the Government of Pakistan, has requested \nthe assistance of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to support public\u2013private partnerships \n(PPPs) in Punjab by augmenting GOPb\u2019s project development facility and the viability gap fund \nto structure and develop more viable PPP projects that offer value-for-money. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Economic growth in Pakistan has been hampered by a lack of investment in critical and \nquality public infrastructure. Public investment on infrastructure has declined over the last decade \nwith the government investing just over 2.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) annually (totaling \nan estimated $5.7 billion in 2015) towards infrastructure,1 well below the estimated required \nannual investment of 7.6% of GDP (equal to $20.6 billion in 2015).2 This has resulted in \ninefficiencies across key infrastructure sectors\u2014such as delays in transport of goods and limited \naccess to energy and potable water\u2014which affect both public welfare, and the country\u2019s overall \nindustrial and economic growth. \n \n4.  Punjab\u2019s population of 110 million accounts for about 53% of that of Pakistan; the \npopulation density of 536 persons per square kilometer is double that of Pakistan as a whole.3 \nPunjab accounts for 60% of national GDP, underscoring its pivotal role for economic growth and \nemployment.4 Punjab is also undergoing significant urbanization, with a compounded annual urban \npopulation growth rate of 3.5% (2007\u20132015), which is four times the rural population growth rate. \nThe urban population reached 42.9 million in FY2015. Cities are facing challenges due to the \nsignificant rural\u2013urban migration, which is increasing demand for public infrastructure. Growing \ninfrastructure investments require broader funding sources from the government, investors and \ncommercial banks, which in the past have shown limited appetite for providing long-dated limited \nrecourse debt to infrastructure projects. \n \n5.  To meet these challenges the GOPb increased its Annual Development Programme \n(ADP) by 15% to an estimated PRs635 billion ($6.0 billion) for FY2018, from PRs550 billion ($5.2 \nbillion) for FY2017.5 Infrastructure development absorbs 36% of the ADP, and is expected to \nincrease by 13%, to PRs230 billion ($2.2 billion) in FY2018.6 Social services represent 23% of \nthe ADP, and will increase by 16% to PRs144 billion ($1.4 billion) in FY2018. However, the \n                                                \n1  Based on World Bank. Data: Gross Domestic Product estimate for Pakistan of $271 billion for 2015. \n2  The estimated infrastructure investment need is based on the need for the South Asia region, which includes \nPakistan.

Data: Population Profile Punjab. \n4  Punjab Board of Investment and Trade. Punjab at a Glance. \n5  Government of Punjab. 2016. Development Programme 2016\u20132017. Lahore. \n6  Allocation for water supply and sanitation has been included in this estimate. \n ", "2 \navailable budget for public investment in infrastructure is largely insufficient to meet the growing \ndemand. Punjab\u2019s infrastructure investment requirement is estimated at about $3.6 billion\u2013$5.0 \nbillion, which significantly exceeds current public capital spending on infrastructure. To address \nthe budget constraints on infrastructure provision, the Punjab government introduced the Punjab \nPublic\u2013Private Partnership for Infrastructure Act (in 2010 and updated in 2014) to augment private \nsector participation in infrastructure through PPPs.7 \n \n6.  In  conjunction  with  the  PPP for Infrastructure  Act  in  2010,  the  Punjab  government \nestablished an institutional framework and guidelines to facilitate the preparation, approval, and \nimplementation  of  PPPs.8 A  PPP  Cell  (PPPC)  was  established  within  the  Planning  and \nDevelopment Department (PDD) to review project proposals (covering technical, operational, and \nlegal compliance to the PPP guidelines), coordinate efforts of line departments, and facilitate the \napproval of PPP projects by the steering committee.9 A Risk Management Unit (RMU) within the \nFinance  Department  also  reviews  project  proposals,  focusing  on  potential  fiscal  risks  and \ncontingent liabilities emanating from PPP projects. The PPPC serves as the PPP Secretariat for \nthe Punjab government, and submits reviews and recommendations (from the PPPC and the \nRMU) to the steering committee for approval. Once approved, the line department is responsible \nfor tendering the project, negotiating agreements, and managing project implementation over the \nterm of the concession agreement. \n \n7.  The PPPC has a growing project pipeline and about 40 staff members with varying levels \nof experience and skills that include transaction advisory, projects, policy, communication, and \nproject monitoring. The RMU has one dedicated staff member with some PPP experience, but its \ncapacity to undertake a comprehensive review of financial proposals and concession agreements \nis insufficient, and capacity building is thus needed. Steering committee members have limited \nproject finance and PPP experience, and are thus likely to rely on the recommendations of the \nPPPC and RMU. This highlights the need for a more focused subcommittee to review feedback \nfrom the PPPC and RMU. The varying levels of skills involved in the Punjab government\u2019s PPP \nframework may result in less-than-optimal structuring of PPPs, and approval of PPPs that offer \nlimited value-for-money (VFM). These projects may potentially expose the Punjab government to \nunwanted risks over the term of the concession. \n \n8.  The Punjab government has a strong pipeline of over 40 projects at various stages of \ndevelopment.10 Six PPP projects have been awarded since 2010,11 and two are now operational. \nNevertheless, additional resources are required to improve the Punjab government\u2019s capacity and \ndeliver more PPP projects that are fiscally sustainable and offer VFM. In some cases, projects \nreceive upfront government support through a viability gap fund (VGF) in addition to operational \nsupport in the form of minimum revenue shortfall guarantees.12 For example, the 70-kilometer \nLahore Ring Road Southern Loop Project, a toll road with a 25-year concession costing PRs25 \nbillion ($238 million) awarded in 2016, included (i) upfront VGF support of PRs4.25 billion ($40 \nmillion) for land acquisition (for land access not provisioned at no cost by the government under \n                                                \n7  Punjab Public Private Partnership Act 2014. \n8  Government of Punjab, Planning and Development Department.

Government of Punjab. Planning \nand Development Department. Awarded Projects. \n12 The VGF is currently an allocated annual budget item under the GOPb\u2019s ADP. The VGF budget is managed by the \nPlanning & Development Department, and monitored by the RMU in the Finance Department. Use of the VGF is \napproved by the PPP steering committee. \n \n ", "3 \nthe project),13 (ii) free provision of land worth PRs4 billion ($38 million) to secure part of the project \nbank borrowing, and (iii) a guarantee to the concessionaire of 50% of the toll revenue shortfall \nshould actual toll revenue fall below 80% of the estimated toll revenue. Other projects that have \nnot tapped the VGF account for provincial government support have still received public support \n(provided by line departments in other forms, such as land allocation). Moreover, there is no \nmechanism for (i) monitoring the contingent liabilities of the government resulting from the PPP \nprojects, and (ii) reflecting these in provincial financial statements. \n \n9.  The Punjab government retained a significant portion of project risk under the Lahore Ring \nRoad Project, which may limit its ability to derive VFM in the long term.14 Ideally, PPP projects \nshould be structured to provide a reasonable balance between the private investor\u2019s interests and \nfiscal prudence. The Lahore Ring Road Project example underscores the lack of appropriate risk-\nsharing between the private concessionaire and the government, which constrains adequate \nleverage of scarce public funds. While a few GOPb line departments have developed some \nexperience with PPP projects, large skill gaps exist within line departments that need to be \naddressed  to  enhance  the  flow  of  benefits  to  the  taxpayers,  with  transactions  rigorously \nscrutinized through due diligence and a VFM test. \n \n10.  To address this issue, the GOPb provides financial assistance to line agencies\u2014through \nthe project development facility (PDF)\u2014to engage transaction advisors.15 Because capacity of \nthe line departments is limited, the PPPC facilitates discussions with the transaction advisors, \naiming to strike a balanced risk-transfer arrangement that limits government contingent liabilities \nand ensures VFM. \n \n11.  The annual VGF budget cannot be rolled over to the following financial year, because \nthere is no dedicated non-lapsable VGF reserved fund account. Also, the GOPb imposes no limits \non the value of VGF resources per project, which are at times limited only by the total VGF budget \nfor that financial year. Imposing a limit would ensure greater leverage of VGF resources. The VGF \nis a powerful tool for leveraging PPPs by (i) providing upfront capital relief to fund project costs to \nensure commercial viability, (ii) lowering the cost of capital by providing concessional funding or \ncapital subsidies that do not require future dividends or budget payments, and (iii) supporting \noperational expenses by providing operational subsidies and/or guaranteeing minimum revenues \nover the course of the concession. \n \n12.  The institutional capacity in Punjab for PPPs needs to be enhanced through (i) improved \nstructuring  of  eligible  PPP  projects  that  offer  VFM  through  a  more  equitable  risk-sharing \narrangement, (ii) a sound policy that guides the use of VGF resources, and (iii) strong risk \nmanagement policies and systems that identify and mitigate potential project and fiscal-related \nrisks emanating from PPP-supported projects. \n \n13.  The project is aligned with the ADB Midterm Review of Strategy 2020,16 in which PPPs \nare a key driver of change, and the ADB country partnership strategy, 2015\u20132019 for Pakistan.17 \nLessons from a similar project in Sindh have been considered in the design of this project.18 Unlike \nthe Sindh project, this project does not propose to establish a separate corporate entity (i.e., a \nVGF  company)\u2014instead,  the  project  will  seek  to  foster  governance  and  accountability  in \n                                                \n13 Land acquisition costs are not capitalized and therefore not recognized as an equity contribution from the GOPb. \n14 The risk transfer arrangement under the project suggests that the GOPb has retained significant funding and \noperations risks by offering significant upfront support and guarantees during operation. \n15 GOPb allocations for the PDF cannot be carried over to the following fiscal year and lapse if not used.  \n16 ADB. 2014.

The new VGF guidelines will require that proposals from line \ndepartments include a VFM assessment; transaction advisers financed under the PDF will \nstructure PPP deals that offer VFM, and not simply aim to meet investor returns. \n \n14.  The decision to adopt an alternative approach to that used in the Sindh project was \ninfluenced by the GOPb\u2019s reluctance to use a VGF company, because the independence required \nfor  risk  management  and  review  and  monitoring  functions  is  already  in  place.  Separate \ngovernment departments oversee the PPPC (which is within the PDD) and RMU (within the \nFinance Department), although some improvements and strengthening of capacity are needed. \n  \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n15.  The project is aligned with the following impact: private sector investments and overall \nemployment in Punjab increased.19 The project will have the following outcome: viable PPP \nprojects that offer VFM increased.20  \n \nC.  Outputs \n16.  The outputs are (i) PDF and VGF resources for PPP projects augmented, and (ii) PPP \ninstitutional capacity enhanced and strengthened. \n \n17.  Output 1: Project Development Facility and Viability Gap Fund resources for public\u2013\nprivate partnership projects augmented. The project will provide financing for the PDF to \nsupport line departments in engaging the assistance of experienced transaction advisors. The \nproposed ADB loan will be used to fund a dedicated VGF window that will be managed by the \nPDD. VGF guidelines will be established that will specify, among other things, (i) the applicability \nand use of VGF resource as capital and/or operational support for eligible PPP projects, (ii) a \nreview and approval process (articulating the process flow from application to approval),21 (iii) \nVGF restrictions of use (if applicable), (iv) conditions for disbursements of VGF resources to \neligible PPP projects, (v) monitoring of performance of VGF-supported projects by the RMU,22 \nand  (vi)  annexes  to  further  articulate  key  provisions  of  the  VGF  guidelines.  Furthermore, \ndedicated  non-lapsable  accounts  for  VGF  and  PDF  will  be  established  in  PDD,  with  joint \ndisbursement authorization by Member PPP (PDD board) and Secretary (PDD), to ensure \nsustainability and continuity of  such resources. This will also help streamline the approval \nprocess, as it will require an upfront budgetary allocation for GOPb funds, with further budgetary \napprovals not required after approval by the PPP steering committee. \n \n18.  Output  2:  Public\u2013private  partnership  institutional  capacity  enhanced  and \nstrengthened. The accompanying TA will support the capacity building component of the project, \nwhich will include engagement of procurement and safeguards specialists to strengthen the \ncapacity of the PPPC, and engagement of project finance and contracts management experts to \nstrengthen RMU capacity. These additional resources will improve the government\u2019s ability to \nthoroughly review PPP proposals and draft concession agreements for potential legal risks, \ncontingent liabilities, fiscal risks, and overall VFM, and recommend an appropriate structure and \n                                                \n19 GOPb. 2015.

Lahore. \n20 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n21 The use of VGF resources will be reviewed by a steering committee subcommittee, composed of steering committee \nmembers who represent the PDD, Finance Department, and private sector. Subcommittee recommendations will be \nsubmitted to the steering committee for approval. \n22 Monitoring by the RMU will include review of contingent asset and liabilities, and review and monitoring of covenants, \nrepayments, and/or returns on government support (with respect to the VGF). \n \n ", "5 \napproach for PPPs. This enhanced capacity will assist the PPP steering committee\u2019s decision-\nmaking process when considering PPP proposals. Subsequent to VGF approval, the RMU will \nmonitor the performance of VGF-supported PPP projects and undertake periodic audits and \nreviews of VGF resources.23 An environmental and social management system (ESMS) will be \nestablished in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), with the PPPC serving \nas  the  ESMS  focal  point  for  VGF-supported  PPP  projects.  The  project  will  support  the \nengagement of a safeguards specialist for each of several selected line departments,24 including \nthe ESMS focal point in the PPPC. The VGF may provide support to eligible subprojects, which \nmay include projects that are classified as category A for the environment and resettlement, and \nthat meet ESMS requirements. Institutional capacity at the PPPC, RMU, and selected line \ndepartments will be strengthened through the accompanying TA. The TA will also support \ninformation  sessions  on  PPPs  to  help  identify  and  address  impediments  to  private  sector \nparticipation, thereby promoting the sharing of knowledge regarding, and the sustainability of, \nPPPs in Punjab.  \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n19.  The project is estimated to cost $219.6 million (Table 1). \n \n20.  Detailed cost estimates by expenditure category and by financier are included in the \nproject administration manual (PAM).25 The majority of the project cost (up to $200.0 million) \nprovides funding for the VGF to support and improve the commercial viability of eligible PPP \nprojects,  with  support  also  provided  ($8.4 million) to  fund the  PDF  to  assist  selected  line \ndepartments engage external transaction advisors to help prepare PPP projects. \n \nTable 1: Summary Cost Estimates \n($ million) \nItem  Amounta \nA.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n23.  The PDD will be the executing and implementing agency for the project. The PPPC will \nbe the implementing unit and will be supported by the RMU. The PDD will manage and administer \nthe VGF resources, and the RMU will monitor the performance of VGF-supported PPP projects \nin accordance with the VGF guidelines. The PDF resources will be administered by the PPPC in \naccordance with the PDF guidelines to support selected line departments to engage experienced \nexternal consultants and transactions advisors to prepare and execute PPP projects.26 The PPPC \nhas been administering PDF support to various line departments since 2010. Institutional capacity \nat  the  PPPC,  RMU,  and  selected  line  departments  will  be  strengthened  through  the \naccompanying TA (para. 26). \n \n24.  The executing and implementing agency will not be directly involved in implementing the \nphysical delivery of approved PPP projects. The relevant line departments will procure the PPP \nprojects, and will legally enter into the respective concession agreements with the selected private \nsector concessionaires. Procurement undertakings related to the ADB loan, including the ADB-\nadministered  grant  and  TA  grant,  will  follow  procedures  pursuant  to  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2015, as amended from time to time) and ADB\u2019s prior review (as required). Because \nthe project will be cofinanced by the Government of the United Kingdom and administered by \nADB, universal procurement will be applied.27 \n \n25.

ATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n26.  The  loan  will  be  accompanied  by  a  transaction  (TA)  for  Enhancing  Public\u2013Private \nPartnerships in Punjab to address skill and resource gaps in the relevant government agencies. \nThe PDD will be the executing agency for the TA. The TA will assist in reviewing PPP project \nproposals requiring VGF support, providing recommendations to the steering committee, and \nmonitoring the performance of those projects. The TA will also help facilitate the evaluation of \nPPP project proposals by selected line departments, and monitor projects in accordance with the \nESMS and other relevant regulations. The TA outputs are (i) improved capacity of the PPPC and \nRMU, (ii) improved capacity of selected line departments, and (iii) enhanced accountability and \ngovernance of the VGF.28 The TA will commence immediately after approval to meet provisions \nunder loan effectiveness. \n \n27.  The TA is estimated to cost $4,450,000, of which $4,008,724 (\u00a33,120,844 equivalent)29 \nwill  be  financed  on  a grant  basis  by  the Government  of the  United Kingdom  and  will  be \nadministered by ADB. The TA consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). TA funds will be \ndisbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as \namended from time to time). The indicative implementation time frame for the TA will be from \nNovember 2017 to December 2022. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n28.  Infrastructure  investment  for  Punjab  must  be  financed  in  part  by  non-public  capital \nspending, including funding from the private sector, which has been investing in energy, telecom, \nand  other  sectors.  Procurement  of  public  infrastructure  and  services  through  PPPs  offers \nopportunities to bridge Punjab\u2019s infrastructure gap. \n \n29.  The $100 million in ADB support to augment Punjab\u2019s VGF resources has the potential to \nraise $200 million to $300 million in additional PPP funding for infrastructure development over \n                                                \n28 Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n29 Exchange rate as of 14 July 2017. \n \n ", "8 \nthe  project  implementation  period.30 Private  sector  infrastructure  financing  can  bridge  the \nfinancing gap and help alleviate poverty through the jobs created by such investments. It can also \nease fiscal constraints faced by the government by allowing the private sector to assume part of \nthe financing burden for public infrastructure development. The introduction of private sector \nexpertise  through  PPPs  may  also  hasten  the  completion  and  enhance  the  efficiency  of \ninfrastructure project operations.  \n \nB.  Governance \n \n30.  The financial management risk rating, before risk mitigation measures, is considered \nsubstantial; it is assessed as moderate taking into account the risk mitigation measures. The \npublic expenditure and financial accountability assessment of 2012 rates the budget credibility of \nthe province as low. The controller general of accounts has major responsibilities for accounting, \npre-audits, and payments. The GOPb is working to form a provincial internal audit authority, but \nthe only internal audit mechanism currently available is the pre-audit of transactions by the office \nof the provincial accountant general. The integrated fiscal monitoring system with consolidated \ndirect  and  contingent  liabilities  relating  to  PPP  projects  is  weak.  The  governance,  risk \nmanagement, and operational policies and procedures in the existing PPP framework for VGF \nare inadequate, due to the absence of VGF guidelines in the framework. The oversight of the PDF \nand VGF need to be improved. Actions required under the project include: (i) establishment of \nnon-lapsable reserve fund accounts for PDF and VGF, in which government funds are transferred \nas block releases; (ii) confirmation that accounting and reporting systems for the PDF and VGF \nare satisfactory to ADB in terms of transparent and reliable financial reporting; (iii) periodic \nexternal audits of VGF and PDF utilization carried out by a firm of chartered accountants \nacceptable to the GOPb and ADB; and (iv) establishment by the RMU of a system to monitor \ndirect and contingent liabilities related to PPP contracts. \n \n31.  The PDD, as the executing and implementing agency, will use the ADB Procurement \nGuidelines for all institutional procurement, and ensure that procedures acceptable to ADB are \nfollowed when (i) private entities are selected through competitive bidding procedures; (ii) private \nentities apply their own procedures for procurement of goods, works, and consulting services; \nand (iii) line departments engage consulting services financed from the PDF acceptable to ADB. \nADB will provide support for engagement of procurement expert(s) under the accompanying TA \nto assist the PDD with procurement activities. The resulting procurement risk is low, as private \nentities will follow procurement procedures acceptable to ADB. The ADB Anticorruption Policy \n(1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and the PDD. \nPolicy requirements and supplementary measures are specified in the PAM (footnote 25). \n \nC.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n32.  Punjab has a 31% poverty rate; deteriorating infrastructure and social services brought \nabout by funding constraints; and wide economic, social, and political gender disparities. PPPs \nare an alternative means of procuring public infrastructure through private sector participation and \nwill help address these problems. The project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming, \nand is expected to produce PPP projects with significant social benefits, especially for vulnerable \ngroups, such as the poor, women and girls, children, the elderly, and people with disabilities. \nSocial impact assessments that include gender as a key parameter will be required for PPP \nproject proposals. Gender training for PPPC and RMU staff will assist in assessing PPP proposals \nwith regard to social and gender issues. Screening guidelines and tools will incorporate social \nand gender criteria, and women will participate in PPP training. \n                                                \n30 On the basis that average gearing offered by commercial banks for a PPP project may be 60% to 70%. \n ", "9 \nD.  Safeguards \n \n33.  In compliance with the ADB Safeguard Policy Statement, the project is categorized as \nfinancial intermediary for the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. 31 \nThe projects requiring VGF support may include projects that are category A for the environment \nand resettlement but C for indigenous peoples (no indigenous or tribal peoples live in or around \nthe project areas). The PDD will need to establish and maintain an ESMS acceptable to ADB that \nfully incorporates the safeguard requirements (SR 1\u20133, including information disclosure and \nconsultation) of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. 32 Subprojects will not be eligible for ADB \nfinancing if they appear on ADB\u2019s Prohibited Investment Activities List. The PDD will ensure the \nESMS is in place prior to ADB\u2019s first disbursement for the financing of eligible projects. \n \n34.  PDD staff resources and skills will be strengthened by engaging environmental and \nresettlement specialists at the PPPC and selected line departments under the TA. Safeguards \nspecialists hired under the TA will provide PPP training in ESMS implementation and monitoring, \nand will assist and enable the PPPC and selected line departments to manage the ESMS, and \ncomply with operational guidelines on environment and social policies, safeguards screening, \ncategorization and review procedures, and oversight during subproject implementation. The \nESMS will be periodically audited and reviewed by external, independent, certified auditors; \nreports (including environmental impact assessments, land acquisition resettlement plans, and \nenvironmental management reports) will be disclosed in line with ESMS and ADB Safeguard \nPolicy Statement disclosure requirements. \n \nE.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n35.  Overall project risks are assessed as medium. Significant risks and mitigating measures are \nsummarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.33 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nDeteriorating local security  The government is making a strong effort to address local security issues. \nreduces private sector  This is outside the scope of the project, and appears not to have influenced \nconfidence and interest in PPP  investment decisions by some local and international investors. \nprojects \nPolitical influence results in  A steering committee decision to proceed with a project deemed and \napproval of PPP projects that  classified as not offering VFM and not complying with ESMS requirements \nmay not offer VFM  will disqualify that project from receiving ADB-funded VGF support. \nESMS = environmental and social management system, PPP = public\u2013private partnership, VFM = value-for-\nmoney, VGF = viability gap fund. \nSource: Asian Development Bank \n \nV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n36.
