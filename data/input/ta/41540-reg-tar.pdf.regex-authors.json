INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  Regional cooperation and integration (RCI) is a powerful tool to accelerate economic \ngrowth, reduce poverty, raise living standards, improve productivity, narrow development gaps, \nand strengthen institutions. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) adopted an RCI strategy in \nJuly 2006,1 and identified RCI as one of its strategic agendas and core operational areas in \nStrategy 2020.2 It will play a key role in helping ADB to achieve its aim of reducing poverty and \nimproving the quality of life in Asia and the Pacific. As a result, the Office of Regional Economic \nIntegration (OREI) was established in late 2005. To support the implementation of the RCI \nstrategy, OREI launched the Asia Regional Integration Center (ARIC) website in October 2006 \nas a one-stop knowledge and information clearinghouse on the progress of RCI initiatives in the \nregion.3  \n \n2.  This  technical  assistance  (TA)  aims  to  expand  the  creation  and  dissemination  of \nknowledge and information on RCI.4 This will increase the capacity of stakeholders (including \ngovernment officials, researchers, members of international institutions, and other online users) \nto promote greater regional integration. It will help to strengthen ADB's role as a knowledge \ninstitution by supporting the dissemination of RCI knowledge products. An internet portal such \nas ARIC is an ideal way to disseminate information on RCI. Building on previous TA projects, \nthis TA will improve the current content (including databases) of the ARIC website and develop \nnew RCI knowledge products.5 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Regional economic integration in Asia and the Pacific has been gaining pace, and ADB \nhas been at the forefront of efforts to promote RCI. Intra-regional trade rose from 47% of the \nregion's total trade in 1990 to 57% in 2008; while the number of free trade agreements (FTAs) \ngrew from 45 at the end of 2000 to 109 at the end of June 2009. Intra-regional foreign direct \ninvestment inflows (as a percentage of total foreign direct investment for the region) have \njumped from 10% in 1990 to 52% in 2005. The recent global economic crisis has shown that \nstronger cooperation and integration is needed to maintain macroeconomic stability and sustain \ngrowth in the region. Other areas of cooperation, such as infrastructure and the environment \nalso have the potential to act as catalysts for regional growth.  \n \n4.  Under Strategy 2020, one of the four roles undertaken by ADB to promote greater RCI is \nexpanding  the  creation  and  dissemination  of  RCI-related  knowledge  and  information  to \ndeveloping  member  countries  (DMCs).  Knowledge  is  a  powerful  catalyst  for  propelling \ndevelopment and enhancing its effects. ADB  has country-specific insights through working \nclosely with governments on long-term issues and a broader outlook than that of any individual \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006.

The TA first appeared in the business opportunities \nsection of ADB's website on 16 November 2009.  \n5  Previous TA projects that supported creation and maintenance of the Asia Regional Integration Center and its \nprecursor, the Asia Recovery Information Center, include ADB. 1999.

Manila (TA 6459-REG). \n ", "2   \ncountry. ADB provides knowledge services to DMCs for their immediate information needs, \nwhile determining and disseminating best practices.  \n \n5.  The ARIC website provides stakeholders with access to the latest news, articles, studies, \nand other information on various RCI initiatives in the region. It also contains online databases \nand  information  on  research.  ARIC  is  in  a  unique  position  to  share  RCI  knowledge  and \ninformation widely, efficiently, and inexpensively. \n \n6.  Maintaining and improving the ARIC website will expand and disseminate knowledge \nand information on RCI to a greater number of stakeholders; boost ADB's role as a knowledge \ninstitution; and provide policy makers with inputs for research and policy formation on RCI-\nrelated issues. The TA will upgrade existing knowledge products and develop new ones to \nfacilitate discussions among stakeholders, and to enhance their capacity to promote greater \nregional integration. In addition, a separate OREI intranet site will be developed to serve as a \nvenue for RCI information sharing within ADB. The information available in the intranet site will \nbe used by ADB staff in evaluating and designing RCI  projects. This will increase ADB's \nknowledge  pool  on  RCI  projects  and  set  the  pace  for  ADB-wide  information  sharing, \nstrengthening OREI's role as the focal point in supporting RCI initiatives in Asia. \n \n7.  The ARIC website traces its roots to the Asia Recovery Information Center website \ndeveloped by ADB in 1999. This provided a clearinghouse for the dissemination and exchange \nof information on the economies hit by the Asian crisis 1997\u20131998 and on their recovery. Since \nits re-launch as the Asia Regional Integration Center in October 2006, the ARIC website has \nestablished itself as a reliable and leading source of RCI information. On average, there are \naround 655 unique visitors and 23,920 hits per day. The website\u2019s information architecture, \ndatabase systems, and state-of-the-art technology have been used as benchmarks by other \ninstitutions. ARIC has been consulted by the Secretariat for the Common Market for Eastern \nand Southern Africa with regard to its plan to establish a regional integration surveillance \nmechanism. The ARIC website was also included by the Center for Comparative Regional \nIntegration Studies at United Nations University in its best-practice analysis of online resources \ndealing with integration studies. The ARIC project team assisted the Association of Southeast \nAsian  Nations  Secretariat  in  developing  the  sections  covering  statistics  and  economic \nintegration in its website. ARIC\u2019s FTA section is currently linked to the Asia-Pacific trade and \ninvestment agreements database, which is maintained by the United Nations Economic and \nSocial Commission for Asia and the Pacific.  \n \n8.  The ARIC project team helped create RCI knowledge products, including 35 working \npapers on regional economic integration; 33 presentation materials from RCI seminar series; \n17 issues of the Asia Economic Monitor (AEM);6 an FTA comparative toolkit; updated RCI \nindicators; an expanded macroeconomic database; and a climate change database. AEM is an \nestablished brand name covered widely by the international media (with major international \nnewspapers often carrying front-page articles based on AEM stories), and highly appreciated by \nusers (as evidenced by 90,000 downloads in 2009). \n \n9.  Several  lessons  have  been  learned  from  the  implementation  of  previous  ARIC  TA \nprojects. First, an important element in the development of the website is the feedback it \nreceives  from  internal  and  external  stakeholders,  which  have  significantly  improved  and \nstreamlined its content and structure. Second, ARIC must improve continuously to fulfill its \nmandate of becoming an authoritative source of information on RCI in Asia and the Pacific. \n                                                 \n6  ADB, Asia Regional Integration Center. Asia Economic Monitor. http://aric.adb.org/asia-economic-monitor/ \n ", "  3\nThird, to attract more users, the ARIC website should increase the consistency and originality of \nits content, and conform to ADB standards in information presentation. Fourth, while enhancing \nits strengths (the money and finance content), it should also emphasize other RCI pillars: cross-\nborder infrastructure, trade and investments, and other regional public goods. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The TA aims to enhance the capacity of key stakeholders to promote greater regional \nintegration by expanding the creation and dissemination of knowledge and information on RCI. \nThe impact of the TA will be reflected in the number and scope of market-led and government-\ndirected RCI initiatives, intra-regional agreements and other venues for cooperation, and the \nimplementation of existing RCI activities in Asia and the Pacific and the development of new \ninitiatives. \n \n11.  The outcome of this TA will be that stakeholders will have access to timely and relevant \nknowledge and information on RCI, including the latest RCI news and information, regional \nintegration  and  macroeconomic  indicators,  and  RCI  knowledge  products,  including  books, \nreports,  working  papers,  a  digest  of  RCI  activities,  and  country  profiles.  They  could  also \nparticipate in strategic discussions on the impact and policy implications of RCI through regional \neconomic integration seminars. It is anticipated that the TA will increase usage of the website by \n10% (compared to the average from the date of ARIC's re-launch to December 2009). Its \noutcome can also be measured by the amount of time spent on a website and the number of \ndownloads, and by the number of direct links from various global and regional websites.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.  The TA will revamp the existing website to include expanded and new content and will \nintroduce more tools for improved user web experience and accessibility. The tasks will include \n(i) revamping  and  enhancing  the  ARIC  website  and  launching  a  new  OREI  intranet  site; \n(ii) preparing  the  AEM  and  other  new  economic  reports,  and  updating  current  databases; \n(iii) developing  new  knowledge  products  and  databases;  (iv)  providing  assistance  in  the \npreparation of the ADB working paper series on regional economic integration; (v) providing \nsupport for the OREI seminar series; and (vi) undertaking other initiatives that will help increase \nweb usage and direct links with other relevant websites. The TA will cover all ADB DMCs. \nAssistance will not be undertaken in any DMC until ADB receives a notice of no-objection from \nthe government of the DMC. \n \n13.  The  website\u2019s  navigational  structure  will  be  overhauled  to  provide  visitors  with  a \nsubstantially  improved  user  experience. Knowledge  tools  will  be  presented  using  geodata, \ndashboards, multimedia, and dynamic data presentation to help widen statistical analysis. The \nTA will develop a new OREI intranet site in collaboration with internal ADB stakeholders. The \nintranet site will promote the harmonization and synchronization of data within ADB. In addition, \nthe intranet site will serve as an information focal point for the ADB internal community of \npractice on RCI and help strengthen ARIC\u2019s efforts to support internal users. \n \n14.  The TA will maintain and update the ARIC's existing content and develop new content. \nNew  issues  of  AEM  will  be  published  and  the  current  content  and  databases  on  trade, \ninvestment,  and  macroeconomic  indicators  will  be  updated  and  expanded  to  include  new \ninitiatives, coverage, and indicators. The TA will develop new databases on infrastructure, \n ", "4   \nbilateral investment treaties, tariffs, energy resources, and the Asian Highway.7 New knowledge \nproducts on RCI will also be developed\u2014including a digest (which will provide updates on the \nprogress and status of various initiatives under each of the four pillars of RCI8), and country \nprofiles (which will provide country information on RCI-related topics). The TA will involve other \ndepartments in ADB in developing new content on the ARIC website, which will complement \nother initiatives being implemented within ADB. OREI may also work with regional departments \nof ADB to link documents in languages other than English to the ARIC website. \n \n15.  To disseminate new knowledge and information on RCI, five to seven seminars will be \nheld during TA implementation. Eight to ten working papers focusing on various issues related \nto the four pillars of RCI will be produced and disseminated. Experts on RCI will be invited to \ncontribute to the seminars and the working paper series.  \n \n16.  Promoting and marketing the ARIC website will be important to achieving the outcome of \nthe TA. Key stakeholders must be aware of the website and the information it contains. OREI \nwill coordinate with internal and external stakeholders to encourage links between the ARIC \nwebsite and other sites. The ARIC website will include survey tools so users can provide \nfeedback, enabling the website to be tailored more closely to user needs. Networking services \n(such as Twitter and RSS [Really Simple Syndication]) will be used and user participation and \ndiscussion on various RCI issues encouraged. The TA will explore ways of enhancing general \naccessibility  to  the  website's  knowledge  products  of  the  placement  of  links  at  multilingual \ndevelopment portals, as well as through the inclusion of a technical glossary.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The TA will require an estimated $1,250,000 to be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-IV  for  $400,000  and  TASF\u2014other  sources  for \n$850,000). The detailed cost breakdown and financing plan are detailed in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA. OREI will implement the TA in close \ncollaboration with other ADB departments and offices. The community of practice on regional \ncooperation and integration will provide advice and guidance as required. The TA is expected to \nbe completed in 24 months, from December 2009 to November 2011 \n \n19.  The TA will require 34 person-months of international consulting services, 226 person-\nmonths  of  national  consulting  services,  and  approximately  0.6  person-months  of  resource \npersons' services (Appendix 3, Table A3). All of the consultants will be hired as individuals and \nin accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime).  Outline  terms  of  reference for  the  consultants  are  in  Appendix  3.  Hiring  a  team  of \nindividual consultants will provide more benefits to ADB than engaging a firm. These include  \n(i) faster mobilization of consultants, (ii) greater control by ADB staff in selecting and managing \nindividual consultants, and (iii) greater flexibility in engaging experts specializing in a broad \nrange of RCI-related topics.  \n                                                 \n7 The Asian Highway is a system of about 140,000 kilometers of roads crisscrossing many Asian countries and with \nlinkages to Europe. Under another OREI TA, a database was developed on ADB-financed road projects that \ncontributed to the Asian Highway network.This database will be uploaded in the ARIC website and be made \navailable to ADB staff and key stakeholders as inputs to the design and evaluation of future regional road projects. \n8 The four pillars of ADB's RCI Strategy are: (i) cross-border infrastructure and related software, (ii) trade and \ninvestment, (iii) money and finance, and (iv) regional public goods. \n ", "  5\n \n20.  The lead economist, with expertise in trade, macroeconomic, or development issues in \nAsia, will be an international consultant and will supervise the revamp of the website and the \nday-to-day operations of the ARIC. Other international consultants will include six economists \nfamiliar  with  RCI  issues  in  Asia  who  will  prepare  special  studies  with  significant  policy \nimplications for RCI and one economics editor who will draft the contents of the ARIC website \nand edit the AEM and working papers. About six resource persons, who are internationally \ndistinguished experts on RCI or policy makers considered as prime movers of Asian integration \nwill be invited as speakers for OREI seminars.  \n \n21.  National consultants will include one lead analyst who will assist in the supervision of \nARIC\u2019s  operations;  seven  economic  analysts  who  will  maintain  and  improve  the  website\u2019s \ncontent, and assist in the preparation of publications and seminars; and one analyst on trade \nlaw who will operate and improve the trade- and investment-related sections of the ARIC \nwebsite. Three web and/or IT specialists will be hired as a website administrator, a multimedia \ndesigner and developer, and system and/or database developer. There will also be one desktop \npublisher  for  the  AEM  reports;  and  one  project  management  assistant  who  will  provide \nadministrative, logistical and data support. To successfully implement this TA, a team of OREI \nstaff  including  one  professional  member  of  staff,  one  national  officer,  and  one  operations \nassistant, assisted by the lead economist, lead analyst and project management assistant, will \nconsolidate consultants' individual outputs as well as coordinate and manage consultants. \n \n22.  The  procurement  of  equipment,  software,  and  statistical  databases  will  be  done  in \naccordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). After the \nTA is completed, any procured equipment will be disposed of in compliance with ADB project \nadministration instructions on administering grant-financed technical assistance projects.9 \n \n23.  The  improved  ARIC  website  will  be  promoted  through  events  sponsored  by  key \nstakeholders.  Printed copies of the AEM and OREI working papers, and ARIC brochures and \nother marketing paraphernalia will be distributed during these promotional events. News on the \nlaunch of the new ARIC website and issuance of the semiannual AEM reports will also be \nreleased  to  the  media.  Seminars  and  workshops  on  regional  economic  integration  will  be \nconducted  to  disseminate  the  TA\u2019s  expected  knowledge  products.  The  project  monitoring \nframework will be improved and used to assess the impact and outcome of the TA. The TA will \nbe monitored through monthly ARIC website user statistics as well as through midterm and final \nTA review reports. RCI news, comments, and suggestions from key stakeholders and ADB staff \nwill also be tracked. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n24.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,250,000 on a grant basis \nfor the Asia Regional Integration Center, Phase III, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2009.
