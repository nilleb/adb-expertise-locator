INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  In early 2014, the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 reconfirmed regional cooperation \nand integration, including for control of communicable diseases, as one of three institutional \nobjectives of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).1 The Operational Plan for Health and the \nRegional  Cooperation  and  Integration  Strategy  highlight  ADB\u2019s  role  in  addressing \ncommunicable diseases at regional and subregional levels.2 A persistent regional challenge is to \naddress malaria, particularly drug-resistant malaria.  \n \n2.  The proposed high-value technical assistance (TA) will scale up regional efforts urgently \nneeded to achieve malaria elimination in Asia and the Pacific.3 \n \n3.  The TA will be financed under the Regional Malaria and Other Communicable Diseases \nTrust  Fund  (RMTF).4 It  will  build  on  ADB\u2019s  comparative  strengths  in  facilitating  regional \ncooperation, mobilizing financing, conducting policy dialogue, and engaging the private sector. \nThe  participating  developing  member  countries  were  involved  in  TA  preparation  and  they \nwelcome this initiative.5 ADB will only undertake activities under this regional TA in countries \nfrom  which  a  no-objection  confirmation  has  been  received.  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.6 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  Countries  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific  have  made  significant  progress  in  combating \ncommunicable diseases, but these diseases remain a leading cause of premature death and \ndisability\u2014measured by years of life lost\u2014for certain South and Southeast Asian countries.7 \nCommunicable diseases slow economic development as they affect workforce productivity, as \nwell  as  trade,  investment,  and  tourism.  The  impacts  on  economies  can  be  substantial.8 \nCountries in Asia and the Pacific, acting out of mutual self-interest, recognize that more regional \neffort is needed to prevent the health and economic consequences of communicable diseases. \n  \n5.  An important disease is malaria. While the region has made progress, more than 36 \nmillion cases and 45,000 deaths from preventable disease are still reported each year. In \naddition, past gains and future progress in combating malaria are now jeopardized by the \nemergence in the GMS of malaria parasites resistant to artemisinin-based combination therapy \n(ACT), the main treatment used worldwide for the most severe form of malaria, P. falciparum. \nModeling suggests that widespread resistance to ACT, and particularly its spread through South \nAsia to Africa, could increase malaria mortality globally by 25%, with devastating consequences.  \n                                            \n1 ADB. 2014.

Regional and economic integration is a key driver of drug-resistant malaria. In this region, \nmost  malaria  occurs  in  or  near  forested  areas,  largely  along  country  borders.  Transport \ncorridors and trade networks are developing fast, bringing new populations into and through \nthese areas and potentially into contact with resistant parasites. Migrant and mobile workers, \noften seek informal, accessing fake or poor quality drugs. These risks underscore the urgent \nneed for regional efforts to prevent the spread of drug-resistant malaria. Achievement of time-\nbound, region-wide elimination of malaria is the only means considered effective for this task. \n \n7.  Malaria  elimination  will  require  regional  cooperation  for  increased  leadership  and \npartnership; reliable and sustained financing; maintaining the efficacy and affordability of quality \nmalaria drugs and other commodities; improved tools for measuring progress; and increased \nattention to health impacts of development projects in malaria-endemic areas. Regional leaders \nhave committed to tackling the disease, as evidenced in the outcome statement of the 8th East \nAsian Summit in October 2013, and welcomed the establishment of the Asia Pacific Leaders \nMalaria Alliance (APLMA) with ADB as the secretariat. This level of political support suggests \nthe time is right for a regional push to address this disease and to use common ground with \nother communicable diseases to strengthen regional collaboration on public health issues. \n \n8.  A broad coalition of countries, development partners, private sector, and civil society \norganizations are addressing aspects of malaria and drug-resistant malaria in the region. The \nWorld Health Organization (WHO) is working with countries to develop national and global \nstrategies  for  malaria  elimination  under  the  Global  Malaria  Elimination  Program.  The \ngovernments of Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, and the Bill and Melinda \nGates Foundation fund important drug-resistant malaria research and program operations in the \nGMS. The Global Fund supports national malaria programs and has provided additional grants \nto countries in the GMS of $100 million for the Regional Artemisinin Initiative (RAI) for 2014\u2013\n2016.9 \n9.  However, this support is largely country-based and does not sufficiently support the \nneed to act regionally. Large funding gaps exist, estimated at more than $175 million per year in \nfour GMS countries to contain drug-resistant malaria alone, not including additional funding \nneeded to reach malaria elimination goals or other communicable disease control efforts.10 \nThese estimates do not include funding needed for regional actions, such as strengthened \ncross-border  information  sharing,  better  availability  of  quality  drugs,  and  strengthening  the \ncapacity of regulatory agencies.11  \n \n10.  The TA will be implemented in close coordination with other development partners. It will \nbe aligned with ADB\u2019s support for the APLMA, other activities under ADB\u2019s RMTF, and the work \nof other ADB departments to minimize duplication and ensure activities are complementary, \nwell-coordinated, and strengthen ongoing malaria and other communicable diseases programs. \nThe  TA  builds  on  ADB\u2019s  successes  and  experience  in  supporting  regional  approaches  to \ncommunicable disease control, HIV and AIDS, avian influenza, and SARS. \n                                            \n9 ADB serves on the executive committee of the Regional Steering Committee for the RAI. \n10 WHO. 2011. Global Plan for Artemisinin Resistance Containment. Geneva. \n11 Regional action also brings greater economies of scale and coordination. Comprehensive consultations with \ndeveloping member countries, development partners, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), centers of excellence, \nand research institutes have found that focused regional initiatives are needed to strengthen malaria elimination and \ncommunicable disease control efforts in Asia and the Pacific.  \n \n ", "3 \n \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact of the TA will be improved health status of the populations in Asia and the \nPacific. The outcome will be reduced risk to the Asia and Pacific region and globally from drug-\nresistant malaria and other communicable disease threats.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  Output  1:  Strengthened  regional  leadership  and  financing  for  malaria  and \ncommunicable disease threats. The TA will build capacity and strengthen coordination to \nimprove regional leadership from national governments and regional bodies. The TA will support \nthe APLMA, the GMS, ASEAN, and other bodies in developing plans and undertaking activities \nthat  increase  regional  cooperation  in  tackling  artemisinin-resistant  malaria  and  other \ncommunicable disease threats. \n \n13.  This output will focus on building mutual support for sustained financing for malaria \nelimination by 2030. This work will underpin high-level discussion and regional policy dialogue \nto effect substantive change in approaches to the financing of malaria elimination. It will also \nsupport a malaria financing meeting in 2015 to build support for recommendations resulting from \nthese analyses. Lastly, it will support the APLMA in revising its regional malaria scorecard to \ntrack both progress toward malaria elimination and reduction in financing gaps.   \n \n14.  Output  2:  Increased  availability  and  use  of  quality  assured  commodities \nappropriate  to  internationally  agreed  guidelines  for malaria  and  other  communicable \ndisease threats. The TA will translate recommendations from the APLMA Access to Quality \nMedicine Task Force into actions in three areas: (i) removal of oral artemisinin therapies from \nAsian and Pacific markets; (ii) improved quality and affordability to the end-user of anti-malarials \nand  rapid  diagnostic  tests;  and  (iii)  improved  capacities  and  cooperation  on  regulation  of \nregionally important anti-malarials and other communicable disease commodities. The TA will \nbuild  on  work  of  the  WHO  and  other  partners,  and  stakeholder  consultations  to  analyze \nchallenges to improving the quality and availability of malaria drugs and other commodities, \ndevelop approaches to address them, build consensus on  priorities, and provide technical \nsupport for relevant country-level action in five GMS countries, and the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina and India.  \n \n15.  The TA will support, in coordination with regulatory authorities, selected pharmaceutical \ncompanies to meet stringent requirements for WHO pre-qualification for producing ACTs and \nother malaria commodities12. It will also support establishment of a regional center for regulatory \nexcellence to build the capacity of national regulatory authorities. Currently, this concept, led by \nthe Government of Singapore with widespread regional buy-in, focuses on high-end drugs \nmostly for noncommunicable diseases.  \n \n16.  To measure the impacts of these activities in improving the end-user market for malaria \ndrugs  and  commodities,  the  TA  will  finance  a  market  survey  in  2017  in  GMS  countries, \nBangladesh, and India. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation will undertake the survey in \n                                            \n12 Malaria commodities: pharmaceuticals, testing equipment, bed nets, insecticides \n ", "4    \n \n2015. \n \n17.  Output  3:  Increased  availability  and  use  of  quality  information,  tools,  and \ntechnologies  on  malaria  and  other  communicable  disease  threats.  Near-real-time, \ngeographically precise data is essential to malaria elimination, including artemisinin resistance, \nas seen in successful elimination and/or eradication efforts, such as those for smallpox and \npolio.  While  promising  pilot  tests  have  demonstrated  the  potential  of  information  and \ncommunication technology (ICT), it is still underutilized in program management. The TA will \ndevelop  and  test  at  least  four  technologies  or  tools,  and  support  operational  research  on \napplying ICT in malaria, with plans to scale up at least two tools or technologies by the end of \nthe project. This will be in coordination with ADB Southeast Asia Department\u2019s activities. \n \n18.  Challenge grants, technical support, and development of plans integrated in national       \ne- and m-health strategies and knowledge-sharing events contribute to this output.13 This ICT \ncomponent will be linked to existing health information systems in each participating country. \nThe TA will help set up ICT data gathering and referral systems from primary health care \ncenters to hospitals, or from local to national level in two GMS countries.  \n \n19.  Output  4:  Communicable  diseases  addressed  in  large  commercial  and \ninfrastructure projects. Ongoing and future infrastructure projects can pilot approaches to \nmalaria  prevention  and  treatment  among  workers  (including  migrants)  and  surrounding \ncommunities. Development and promotion of an easily usable health impact assessment (HIA) \ntool could reduce the impacts of communicable diseases from projects across the region.  \n \n20.  The  TA  will  (i)  explore  possible  intervention  at  development  sites  and  possibly  at \ndifferent points on migration paths, including work with companies involved in development \nprojects; (ii) work with relevant regional associations to develop norms and standards for health \nprotection and access to care around development projects; (iii) develop and test mechanisms \nto ensure that migrant workers and other vulnerable populations at development sites have \naccess to malaria prevention and treatment, including in areas where migrants may avoid or not \nbe eligible for government services; and (iv) work to include considerations on communicable \ndiseases in instruments for economic and social impact assessments of development projects.  \n \n21.  A major assumption is that relevant national and local governments in the region will \nremain committed to malaria elimination as endorsed by WHO, and will adequately fund and \nsupport national malaria programs beyond the support received from this TA, which is designed \nto  address  regional  issues  contributing  to  the  spread  of  artemisinin  malaria  and  other \ncommunicable diseases.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n22.  The TA is estimated to cost $18,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nRegional Malaria and Other Communicable Disease Threats Trust Fund14 under the Health \nFinancing Partnership Facility and administered by ADB. The participating governments will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of in-kind contributions.  \n \n                                            \n13 E-health is the transfer of health resources and health care by electronic means. m-health (mobile health) is a \ngeneral term for the use of mobile phones and other wireless technology in medical care. \n14 Financing partners: the governments of Australia and the United Kingdom. \n ", "5 \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements  \n23.  ADB will be the executing agency through the Regional and Sustainable Development \nDepartment, which will lead overall implementation in collaboration with the Southeast Asia \nDepartment  and  other  regional  departments.15 A  project  steering  committee  with  cross-\ndepartmental membership will periodically review TA plans and progress to ensure coordination. \nThe Poverty Reduction, Social Development, and Governance Division is recruiting a fixed-term \ninternational staff with malaria and communicable disease program expertise to support TA \nmanagement. The TA will be implemented from November 2014 to December 2017.  \n \n24.  The TA will procure services through several long-term individual consultant contracts \n(54 international and 120 national person-months), and larger contract packages with firms \nthrough  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  with  an  80:20  quality\u2013cost  ratio.  Consultants \nQualification Selection will be used for certain assignments under output 3 and 4,  since these \nassignments are time-critical and short-term in nature. Three agencies will be recruited on a \nSingle Source Selection (SSS) basis as they have exceptional experience in implementing their \nassignments: (i) WHO under output 1 will provide international consultant input (20 person-\nmonths,  intermittent)  and  national  consultant  input  (36  person-months,  intermittent);16 (ii) \nPopulation  Service  International  (PSI)  under  output  2  for  continuing  additional  malaria \ncommodities surveys in the GMS and initiating similar surveys in Bangladesh as it has unique \nexperience and strong presence in all countries to be surveyed and no other NGOs or firms \nhave required capacity and experience to undertake the task; and (iii) DUKE-NUS under output \n3 to deliver the activities related to the collaboration with the Center for Regulatory Excellence \n(CORE) as Duke-NUS is the host of CORE and the only agency which can ensure that the TA \nrelated  activities  on  strengthening  regulatory  processes  for  malaria  and  other  infectious \ndiseases pharmaceutical are aligned with regional best practice and coordinated with CORE. All \nconsultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2013, as amended from time to time). Procurement of goods and services will follow ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time). The TA funds will be disbursed \nin accordance with the Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). Output-based contracts will be utilized to the extent possible. Advance action will \nbe conducted but no contract will be awarded before ADB Board approval. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S RECOMMENDATION \n \n25.  The  President  recommends  that  the  Board  approve  ADB  administering  technical \nassistance not exceeding the equivalent of $18,000,000 to be financed on a grant basis by the \nRegional  Malaria  and  Other  Communicable  Disease  Threats Trust  Fund  under the  Health \nFinancing  Partnership  Facility  for  the  Results  for  Malaria  Elimination  and  Control  of \nCommunicable Disease Threats in Asia and the Pacific.  \n                                            \n15 Assessments of financial management systems, procurement, and financial reporting of implementing partners are not required \nfor this high-value TA as ADB is the implementing agency and is not delegating implementation to a third party. However, output-\nbased contracts and other tools will be utilized to the extent possible to reduce additional burdens on internal ADB departments, \ne.g., the Controller\u2019s Department and the Operations Services and Financial Management Department. \n16 WHO is leading preparation of the annual World Malaria Report, and the activities to prepare the detailed malaria scorecard are a \nnatural continuation and strengthening of its previous work. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nData Sources and \nPerformance Targets and \nDesign Summary  Reporting  Assumptions and Risks \nIndicators with Baselines \nMechanisms \nImpact      Assumptions \nImproved health status  Disability adjusted life years  WHO Burden of  Political stability or absence of \nof the populations in  from malaria and other  Disease study  social conflict \nAsia and the Pacific   communicable diseases   \nStable economic environment \naverted by 2020 (baseline:  WHO Annual World \n  (low inflation, growth) \n30% in 2011, WHO)  Malaria Report  \n      No natural disasters \nAll five GMS countries meet    \n  their annual malaria  Risk \nelimination targets by 2025.
