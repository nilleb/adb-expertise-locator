Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific, prepared by the Economics and Research \nDepartment, is one of the annual flagship publications of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). \nIt provides the latest comprehensive compendium and analysis of trends in economic, social, \nfinancial, and Millennium Development Goal (MDG) indicators of ADB\u2019s regional members. It \nalso contains a special chapter that provides in-depth, data-intensive policy analysis of an \nimportant  policy  issue. In general,  Key  Indicators  provides  a  strong data  and  information \nsupport system for evidence-based policy making.1 \n \n2.  The proposed technical assistance (TA) will support the preparation of the 47th edition of \nKey Indicators. As it is a premier knowledge product of ADB, and consistently among the top \ntwo downloaded ADB publications since 2008, its quality must be maintained and its contents \nmust be continuously improved. For the special chapter, this requires selecting a topic of policy \nimportance to the region and providing a rigorous analysis of associated issues. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Well-functioning factor markets are a cornerstone of the efficient allocation of resources, \naffecting the pace of innovation, integration, and inclusiveness. The existence of such markets \nis widely believed to have played a crucial role in enabling and facilitating the rapid growth and \nstructural transformation experienced by today\u2019s high-income developing member countries \n(DMCs) such as Hong Kong, China; the Republic of Korea; Singapore; and Taipei,China during \ntheir transition from low to middle and high incomes.   \n \n4.  For economies that aim to undertake rapid structural transformation, labor and land use \n(in addition to capital) must shift quickly in response to changing economic conditions and \npolicy  stimuli.  These  shifts  occur  simultaneously  across  sectors  (e.g.,  from  traditional \nagriculture to modern manufacturing and services); regions (e.g., from rural to urban regions or \nlagging to dynamic provinces); and firms (e.g., from low productivity, older firms to higher \nproductivity, young firms). But such shifts can be especially disruptive for labor, and owners \nand/or  users  of  land  (including  small  agricultural  households).  An  increasingly  important \nchallenge for economies in Asia and the Pacific is to design regulatory systems that balance \nthe need for flexibility in reallocating factors of production with the need for security or welfare \nof those factors having to adjust.  \n \n5.  In  addition  to  the  special  chapter,  the  latest  Key  Indicators  edition  contains \n118 statistical tables of indicators grouped according to various themes, including the MDGs; \npeople;  economy  and  output;  money,  finance,  and  prices;  globalization;  transport  and \ncommunications; energy and electricity; environment; and government and governance. A \nshort, nontechnical commentary of selected indicators precedes each of the groups. A review \nof the statistical tables will be carried out to determine whether new indicators need to be \nadded and whether some existing indicators may be discontinued. Additionally, the MDG tables \nwill have to be modified to reflect new indicators that capture the post-2015 development \nagenda. Similarly, the choice of indicators to be analyzed in the commentaries will be carefully \nconsidered to reflect the impact of current developments across different themes. \n                                                \n1  Key Indicators has four major parts: Part I\u2014the special chapter; Part II\u2014the MDGs; and Part III\u2014the regional \ntables.  A  fourth  part\u2014country  tables containing socioeconomic data  of  ADB developing member  countries, \nAustralia, Japan, and New Zealand\u2014is only available online and on USB flash drive. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 5 November 2014. \n ", "2  \n \n6.  The message and data contents of Key Indicators must be effectively disseminated to \nits target audience, which includes policy makers, statistical offices, researchers, academics, \njournalists, the private sector, ADB staff, regional and international organizations, and the \npublic. Key Indicators is viewed as a credible and valid source for statistics and development \npolicy issues in Asia and the Pacific.  \n \nIII.  THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The  impact  of  Key  Indicators  2016  will  be  to  influence  the  environment  in  which \neconomic monitoring and policy formulation, investment decisions, and new projects occur, \nespecially in ADB\u2019s DMCs. Potential performance targets include citations over the long term to \nthe analytical work produced from this product in formal policy documents by development \npartners and DMCs. \n \n8.  The outcome will be that by the end of the project, Key Indicators 2016 will be referred to \nby policy makers and economic researchers within and outside ADB, as well as by the public. \nThe improved content of Key Indicators 2016 will provide (i) information on economic trends and \nemerging policy issues that affect the development prospects of DMCs; (ii) high-quality data \npresented in the country, regional, and post-2015 development agenda tables; and (iii) new \nindicators on a specific theme. Potential performance targets would be short-term citations by \nreputable media outlets and invitations to speak on topics covered by Key Indicators. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA will support the following key activities of Key Indicators 2016: (i) preparing \nbackground  papers  and  conducting  data-intensive  research  related  to  the  special  chapter; \n(ii) drafting the special chapter; (iii) updating, compiling, and validating data for the country, \nregional, and post-2015 development agenda tables; (iv) editing, laying out, and printing the \npublication; (v) disseminating the publication; and (vi) analyzing important policy issues related \nto emerging challenges for future special chapters of the Key Indicators series. Following the   \n2-year production cycle, initial preparations for Key Indicators 2017 may also be supported \nunder this TA. \n \n10.  Keeping  in  view  the  topics  of  previous  Key  Indicators  special  chapters\u2014a \ncomprehensive  examination  of  poverty  (Key  Indicators  2014),  structural  transformation \n(Key Indicators  2013),  and  skills  (forthcoming  in  Key  Indicators  2015)\u2014an  in-depth \nexamination of the regulations and performance of labor and land markets is proposed for the \nspecial chapter of Key Indicators 2016. The tentative topic is labor and land regulatory reforms \nfor innovation, integration, and inclusive growth. Concerns with economic outcomes in several \nparts of Asia and the Pacific are closely tied to the performance of factor markets. In the case \nof India, for example, labor regulations are held responsible for the lack of regular jobs in \nformal manufacturing, while in the People\u2019s Republic of China, the concern is that the country \nis  moving  too  quickly  from  a  flexible  to  an  inflexible  labor  market.  Similarly,  land-related \nregulations may be holding back the speed of urbanization in several economies in the region, \nand the conversion of land from low to high productivity uses. Improving the functioning of \nfactor  markets  is  not  simple,  however.  Labor-related  regulations,  for  example,  have  an \nimportant role in protecting workers from exploitative working conditions and job-displacing \neconomic shocks. Similarly, regulations on land use can improve the bargaining power of small \n ", "  3\nfarmers in relation to real estate developers. What is needed is a move to a set of optimal \nregulations  that  balance flexibility  with  the  welfare  of those factors  having  to  adjust. The \nproposed  special  chapter  will  examine  approaches  to  designing  such  regulations  and \nunderstanding their impact on different population subgroups, gender in particular. It will also \npay careful attention to the capacity of the state in enforcing these regulations. \n \n11.  The special chapter will rely on several types of analyses. Background studies will \ncover, among others (i) a literature review encompassing the theory and empirical studies of \nhow labor and land regulations affect the aggregate economic performance of selected sectors; \nfirms\u2019 decisions regarding product lines, employment levels, technology adoption, and location; \nand labor market outcomes; (ii) a review of labor and land regulations across DMCs and \nselected comparator countries outside Asia and the Pacific, and how these compare with what \ntheory tells us is optimal from efficiency and equity perspectives; and (iii) country case studies, \nusing a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods. The last set of studies will analyze cases \nwhere actual labor and land use regulations are leading to suboptimal outcomes, and suggest \nhow the design and implementation of regulations could be improved.3 These studies will likely \ninvolve analyses of household, labor force, and enterprise survey data; land registries; or \nadministrative records data relevant to labor and land issues. To enhance research quality, the \nDevelopment Indicators and Policy Research Division (ERDI) will seek partnerships with top \nresearch centers or institutes in the areas of labor and land regulation.4 \n \n12.  On the statistics side, the TA will undertake a review of the current set of MDG indicators.  \nThis is required since the post-2015 development agenda is under discussion and will replace \nthe current set of MDG indicators. In addition, based on exploratory analysis, a new set of \nindicators will be introduced on a topic of importance to economic policy making. A promising \ncandidate is a specialized set of disaggregated trade indicators that account for the growing \nimportance of global value chains in production in the region. Such data are useful for policy \nmakers as they allow a much clearer distinction between value added and production data than \nis possible by currently available trade statistics. Significantly, the new trade indicators will draw \non the outputs of statistical capacity-building work carried out by ADB in the area of national \naccounts. Another possibility in this regard could be specialized indicators around the theme of \nthe special chapter. \n \n13.  As part of preparing Key Indicators 2016, workshops and seminars will be held, with \ninvitees to include prominent researchers, key government officials, policy makers, and other \nkey stakeholders. Workshops and seminars are especially crucial for (i) developing the special \nchapter(s),  (ii)  firming  up  the  initial  findings  of  the  background  research  papers,  and \n(iii) discussing  constraints  on  and  the  general  direction  of  the  special  chapter(s).  Further, \nworkshops and seminars may be held to look at the possibility of harmonizing inclusiveness with \ndevelopment effectiveness by analyzing economies in Asia and the Pacific that are making \nprogress in reducing poverty and inequality. Distinguished experts will be invited to give their \nviews  so  that  the  outputs  of  the  workshops  will  be  useful  in  finalizing  the  Key  Indicators \npublications.  Research,  consultations,  and  discussions  with  staff  from  regional  and  other \n                                                \n3  The chapter is not expected to cover the issue of land reforms in terms of redistribution of agricultural land, a topic \nthat has a voluminous literature.   \n4  Collaborations will be explored at a global and regional or country level. In the area of labor regulations, potential \npartners include the International Labour Organization; Centre for Economic Performance, London School of \nEconomics, United Kingdom; and the Institute for the Study of Labor at the University of Bonn, Germany. \nRegarding land regulations, a potential partner is the urbanization program of the International Growth Centre. \nPotential partners at the regional or country level will be determined once the countries for which in-depth case \nstudies are to be carried out are finalized. \n ", "4  \ndepartments  within  ADB  will  also  be  conducted  to  validate  the  relevance  of  the  research \nfindings, as well as to identify emerging concerns that can be potential topics for future Key \nIndicators publications. \n \n14.  A series of internal meetings and workshops will be organized to streamline the Key \nIndicators production process. Production bottlenecks to be addressed will include issues such \nas  staff  and  consultant  assignments;  overall  coordination;  development  of  commentaries; \ngeneration  of  statistical  tables  related  to  country,  region,  and  the  post-2015  development \nagenda; and consultant recruitment. System improvements will be carried out, including the \ninterlinked processes involving the statistical database system. The use of Statistical Data and \nMetadata Exchange as an additional platform for regular communications and data exchanges \nwill be explored, including sending out Key Indicators questionnaires and receiving replies, and \nfor discussion forums including on best practice and methods. 5 Close monitoring of the Key \nIndicators  process  will  mitigate  the  risk  of  unforeseen  circumstances  that  may  affect  the \nproduction schedule. \n   \n15.  To improve the quality of Key Indicators, new regional aggregations may be introduced \nin the statistical tables. Various aggregations are currently available but are limited to a few \nindicators.  Compiling  aggregates  using  transparent,  consistent,  and  sound  methods  and \npractices will provide additional value to users. However, this may involve looking at different \nclassifications and aggregation practices used in Key Indicators in light of recent socioeconomic \ndevelopments in Asia and the Pacific and practices of other international organizations, and this \nmay raise complex issues. The TA will support the development of methodologies to produce \nthe aggregations. \n \n16.  To ensure accuracy, coherence, and consistency of approach across the different parts \nof  Key  Indicators,  the  knowledge  products  will  undergo  stringent  editing  following  ADB\u2019s \nHandbook of Style and Usage.6 Experienced international economics or manuscript editors will \nhelp  prepare  the  publication\u2019s  special  chapter(s)  and  highlights.  Copy  editors  will  edit  the \nregional tables, country tables, post-2015 development agenda tables, the definitions, and front \nparts of the documents.  \n \n17.   The Key Indicators publications will be widely disseminated in coordination with ADB\u2019s \nDepartment of External Relations. Dissemination will start with an international media launch \nfollowed by seminar presentations to key government officials, businesspeople, academia, and \nother research groups. Concurrently, the publications will be uploaded to the ADB website. \nBackground papers will be published separately in ADB\u2019s working paper series, the Asian \nDevelopment Review, or other media at a later date. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost $750,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). Appendix 2 presents the cost estimates and \nfinancing plan. \n \n                                                \n5  Statistical Data and Metadata Exchange or SDMX is the electronic exchange of statistical information. It is an \ninitiative supported by the Bank for International Settlements, European Central Bank, Eurostat, International \nMonetary Fund, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, United Nations, and the World Bank to \nharmonize and standardize exchange of statistical information. \n6   ADB. 2011.

ERDI \nwill coordinate with other ADB units (regional departments and resident mission offices) and \nstatistical partners in ADB regional members in undertaking the activities for this TA. The project \nwill be implemented over 25 months, beginning December 2014 until its targeted completion on \n31 December 2016. \n \n20.  The Key Indicators publication is produced by a team consisting of ERDI international, \nnational, and administrative staff with support from international and national consultants. For \nKey Indicators 2016, an estimated 15 person-months of international consultancy services and \n119 person-months of national consultancy services will be needed for the entire production \nprocess, i.e., for the special chapter, the statistical tables (country, post-2015 development \nagenda, and regional tables), special pilot indicators or datasets, and other developmental \nactivities related to improving data quality and promoting effective dissemination of findings.  \n \n21.  Consulting services are required to develop the different parts of Key Indicators. For the \nstatistical tables, the international consultants will review data issues pertaining to the statistical \ntables  published  in  Key  Indicators,  and  propose  viable  imputation  procedures for  selected \nimportant indicators compiled in the publication. The national consultants will assist in preparing \nthe statistical tables and commentaries, layout of text and tables, and manuscript or copy editing. \n \n22.  For the special  chapter, the  international  and national  consultants  will  work  on  the \nanalysis and write-up for a theme of interest (to be finalized), prepare background reports and \noriginal research related to the theme, and provide some manuscript and economics editing, \nwhile  the  national  consultants  will  assist  in  data gathering,  data  cleaning  and  updating of \nindicators and further research on the indicators, layout of text and tables, and manuscript and \ncopy editing. Surveys may be conducted in selected DMCs as necessary to enhance and \nimprove the relevance of the analysis. \n \n23.  International and national consultants will also be used for developing a new set of \nindicators  on  a  topic  of  importance to  economic  policy  making.  Resource  persons  will  be \nengaged for the workshops to be conducted, e.g., Key Indicators workshops for the special \nchapters and subregional workshops for the statistical tables. Travel of ADB staff participating in \nrelated workshops, conferences, or seminars as resource persons and providing administrative \nand support services may also be supported, in accordance with the appropriate administrative \nguideline. \n \n24.  The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3 and the publication \noutline is in Appendix 4. The consultants will be hired as individuals and will be engaged in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to \ntime).  Disbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n25.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $750,000 on a grant basis for \nKey Indicators for Asia and the Pacific 2016, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n  Performance Targets  Data Sources and \nDesign \nand Indicators with  Reporting  Assumptions and Risks \nSummary \nBaselines  Mechanisms \nImpact      Assumption \nThe impact of Key  At least one DMC or  Government,  The DMC applies \nIndicators 2016 will  development partners  development  evidence-based policy \nbe to influence the   in a DMC acts on at  partners, and  making and believes in \nenvironment in  least one finding of  relevant regional  the value of the \nwhich economic  Key Indicators through  bodies\u2019 reports  information produced. \nmonitoring and  a government   \npolicy formulation,  program, project or  Risks \ninvestment  policy document, or  Unforeseen changes in \ndecisions, and new  related output  the global or regional \nprojects occur,    political, economic, and \nespecially in ADB\u2019s  At least one output is  technological environment \nDMCs.  produced in a peer- render Key Indicators \nreviewed, policy- messages inopportune. \noriented journal   \nSimilar publication from \nother organizations. \nOutcome  By 2016:    Assumptions \nThe outcome will be      Key Indicators 2016 is \nthat by the end of  Key Indicators is cited  Department of  communicated effectively. \nthe project, Key  in major newspapers  External Relations   \nIndicators 2016 will  and publications  media monitoring  Accurate, reliable, and up-\nbe referred to by  (baseline: 10 top-tier  reports  to-date data are available \npolicy makers or  media citations)     for regional members. \neconomic       \nresearchers within  Key Indicators\u2019 content  ADB promotional  Risk \nand outside ADB, as  is used in corporate  materials  Similar publications from \nwell as by the  materials such as the    other organizations are \npublic.
