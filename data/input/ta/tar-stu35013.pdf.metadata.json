INTRODUCTION\n1. Poverty and poor health are closely intertwined. Poor health traps the poor into poverty and\nliving in poverty contributes to poor health. Investments in health are key to poverty reduction:\nUnder its Policy for the Health Sector, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) supports efforts of its\ndeveloping member countries (DMCs) to provide broad access to basic preventative, promotive,\nand curative efforts to the poor. As populations grow and as new health threats emerge, however,\nmost government allocations to the health sector become increasingly inadequate. A key aspect of\nthe health policy mandates ADB to help DMCs diversify their financing for the sector. Designing\nalternative health financing schemes that address the needs of the poor and are sustainable\npresents health planners with numerous challenges in design and implementation. Many lessons\ncan be drawn from the experience of DMCs that are currently implementing alternative health\nfinancing arrangements. Some mechanisms for targeting health services to the poor were cited in\nthe Health Sector Reform in Asia and the Pacific,1 but finding the most appropriate ones requires\nmore information relating to their design and implementation. All the experience and information\nwill  assist  ADB  and  DMCs  in  designing  innovative  alternative  financing  strategies  to  more\neffectively address the health needs of the poor.\n2.   Through this regional technical assistance (TA),2 ADB, with the cooperation and parallel\nefforts of the World Bank,3 will consolidate and analyze the experience of selected DMCs with\nvarious health financing schemes and develop recommendations for the design of optimal health\ncoverage systems for the poor. A logical framework for the TA is in Appendix 1.\nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n3. Two thirds of the world\u2019s poor4 live in Asia: South Asia counts over half a billion people\nliving in poverty while East Asia and the Pacific have a quarter of a billion. The health status of the\npoor is not encouraging: the incidence of illness and poor health and the likelihood of falling ill are\nhigher than among the non-poor. Since the main asset and source of livelihood of the poor is their\nlabor services, poor health renders them less economically productive and makes them vulnerable\nto remaining in poverty.\n4.   Insufficient access to basic health services and the high prevalence of diseases explain\nmuch of the worse health status of the poor. Communicable diseases are the leading causes of\nmorbidity and mortality among the poor. When poor health is expressed in terms of disability-\nadjusted life years (DALYs), its foremost causes are diseases that can be prevented easily and\ncheaply,  provided  effective  health  systems  are  in  place.  These  include  respiratory  infections,\ndiarrhea, tuberculosis, malaria, and malnutrition. But the poor face a double burden of disease\u2014\nthey  bear  the  major  brunt  of  communicable  diseases  but  also  suffer  from  noncommunicable\ndiseases, which are very costly to treat. The major noncommunicable diseases facing the poor\ninclude heart diseases, cancers, accidents, and mental illnesses.\n5.   The poor face significant barriers to obtaining health care. The cost of health care is\nunaffordable to many of the poor: the direct costs include user fees, expenditures on medicines\nand  transportation,  lost  wages,  and,  in  some  instances,  informal  payments.  The  quality  of\n                                                          \n1  Paper produced under Technical Assistance (TA) 5668-REG: Study of Regional Health Policy Priorities, for $600,000,\napproved on 9 January 1995.\n2  The TA was first listed in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet version) on 5 February 2001.\n3 See paragraph 20.\n4 Living on less than $1 per day.", "2\ngovernment health care services to the poor is often poor; resources are insufficient to adequately\nstaff and furnish the health centers with the necessary health equipment, supplies, and medicines.\nAlternatives to government-delivered service, e.g., nongovernment providers and referral hospitals,\nare often not found in areas where the poor live. Lack of information and low education contribute\nto  incorrect  health  assessments  and  lead  to  delays  in  seeking  treatment  and  to  reliance  on\ntraditional,  often  ineffective  and  unsafe,  care.  In  addition,  the  poor  may  live  in  unsanitary\nenvironments and have greater exposure to unsafe work conditions.\n6.  The economic consequences of poor health and illnesses to a poor household are severe.\nThe high direct costs of ill health deplete their meager savings. Households are deprived of the\nincome generated by their main asset, their labor services. For the poor household, this renders\nthem vulnerable to falling deeper into poverty. For the household living on the borderline of\npoverty, poor health or a catastrophic illness pulls them back into poverty. However, some of these\nconsequences are largely preventable: the main determinants of the poor\u2019s health status can be\naddressed at relatively low cost.\n7.  Low-income countries spend a very low percentage of their gross domestic product on the\nhealth  sector,  typically  3-4  percent.  Narrow  tax  bases  and  weak  collection  capacities  limit\ngovernments\u2019 revenues and allocations. And as populations increase and new health threats\nemerge, most governments\u2019 outlays for the health sector become inadequate for meeting the\nneeds of their constituencies. As a consequence, the greater proportion of health-related expenses\ncome out of households\u2019 own financial resources. Health financing schemes currently undertaken\nby governments and funding agencies span a broad spectrum with respect to the financial burden\non the poor, ranging from paying user fees to full subsidization. Governments finance health\nservices5 using (i) greater allocations in government budgets, (ii) loans and grants from external\nsources, (iii) social insurance, and (iv) user charges. DMCs rely more on external sources of funds\nwhile user fees account for a small percentage.\n8.   Increasing access to the poor, delivering quality health care, and ensuring sustainable\nfinancing are the main challenges to be addressed in designing and implementing alternative\narrangements of financing health care for the poor. The most important factors toward obtaining\ncare and participation by the poor are affordability and quality. The health care needs and financial\npositions of the poor need to be considered in deciding the range of services to offer and the\npayment arrangements to be put in place. At the same time, health service providers have to put in\nplace mechanisms to ensure sustainability, providing for financial and risk management in terms of\npricing and coverage, the range of care and services provided, conditions and exclusion criteria,\nand procurement arrangements. In the case of social insurance, health planners are presented\nwith the challenges of adverse selection, moral hazard, cost escalation, and fraud.\n9.  Health financing schemes being implemented in DMCs fall under four major classifications:\n(i) free services for everyone, (ii) cost recovery with exemptions for the poor, (iii) health equity\nfunds, and (iv) health insurance for the poor.6 Free services are easy to implement and may\nencourage the use of preventive and curative services among the poor. However, in most DMCs,\nthis is financially unsustainable and, often, the non-poor take greater advantage of such services\nthan the poor do. Cost recovery schemes provide health facilities with more revenues and allow for\n                                                          \n5  R28-99: Policy for the Health Sector, 25 February.\n6  Examples of regional studies that address some of these are Sustainable Health Care Financing in Southern Africa\n(1996) and Policy Choices and Practical Problems in Health Economics (Cases from Latin America and the\nCaribbean) (1996) from the Economic Development Institute of the World Bank.  Health Care in Asia: A Comparative\nStudy of Cost and Financing (1992) by Charles Griffin provides an overview of health care in Asia in the 1980s.  This\nTA study will complement it by providing lessons and greater detail from selected health financing schemes.", "3\ncross-subsidization for the poor. However, it is difficult to target the most needy and there is little\nincentive for providers to provide exemptions to the poor as this reduces their revenues.  Health\nequity funds reduce the disincentive for the provider to serve the poor since the schemes do not\naffect provider revenues. However, such schemes need an effective communication campaign to\ninform people of how to access the fund. Health insurance schemes take various shapes, including\ngovernment-financed, private, and community-based schemes. Health insurance for the poor can\nreduce the financial constraints of the system and of the poor in seeking health care because it\nallows the poor to \u201cprepay\u201d for services in small amounts and offers greatly reduced rates for some\nservices,  sometimes  free.  However,  health  insurance  schemes  are  difficult  to  establish  and\noperate. Administrative and financial expertise is required to ensure that the schemes are run well\nand offer quality health services; otherwise, the insurance would have no value. Moral hazard\namong the participants is a problem and, if participation is not compulsory, problems of adverse\nselection  can  arise.  The  International  Labor  Organization  and  World  Bank  are  currently\nexperimenting with reinsurance schemes to improve the financial viability of community health\ninsurance plans\n10.   These  health-financing  schemes  have  met  varying  degrees  of  success  in  terms  of\nsustainability  and  in  addressing  the  health  needs  of  the  poor.  Multilateral  development\norganizations, development agencies, and health sector researchers have individually documented\nand analyzed some of the experience. The documentation should be compiled, organized, and\nanalyzed to better inform policy planners on possible initiatives for designing alternative health\nfinancing arrangements, particularly as they pertain to the health care needs of the poor. Current\nresearch and documentation reveal gaps on issues that relate to the poor, including (i) participation\nand payment mechanisms; (ii) level and quality of basic preventative, promotive, and curative care\ngiven; (iii) cost efficiency and sustainability; (iv) financial burden on the client; (v) impacts on the\nprovision of health care by the government and by private providers; and (vi) effects of these\nschemes on client health and on their spending on basic human needs.\n11. An evaluation of experience across schemes and countries in Asia will yield lessons for\nsimilar situations in other DMCs. Country case studies will be most helpful in examining different\naspects  of  a  health  program  in  view  of  country-specific,  socioeconomic,  and  health  system\ncharacteristics, and legal and political environments.\nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA. Objectives\n12.   In line with ADB\u2019s Policy for the Health Sector, the objective of the TA is to identify a range\nof  health  financing  options  that  could  assist  DMC  governments  to  diversify  their  sources  of\nfinancing of health services for the poor. The TA will\n(i)  identify  and  analyze  a  range  of  innovative  and  sustainable  health  financing\nschemes that serve the health needs of the poor,\n(ii)  analyze and consolidate the results of the studies and produce \u201cuser friendly\u201d\nrecommendations documenting best practices, and\n(iii)  disseminate this information to policymakers and health planners.", "4\nB.   Scope\n13.   The TA will (i) undertake case studies in the selected countries including comparative\nanalyses of health financing schemes; (ii) develop recommendations for policymakers and health\nplanners  for  the  design  of  optimal  health  coverage  systems  for  the  poor;  and  (iii)  support\ndissemination activities through (a) a regional workshop focusing on the findings of the study; and\n(b) publication of the case studies, topic briefs, recommendations, and a guide (regional study) for\ndesigning health care financing alternatives that address the poor.\n14.    The study will be conducted in two phases.  During the first phase, the TA study will\ndocument, collate,  and  analyze  information  related  to  the  experience  of  selected DMCs  with\ndifferent health financing schemes.  Available data, research, and country reports will be brought\ntogether to examine household, government, and private sector experience. In addition, relevant\nstakeholders will be interviewed whenever necessary. Details of implementation arrangements will\nbe recorded, and socioeconomic conditions and legal frameworks within which these schemes\nhave  been  executed  will  be  examined.  In  analyzing  the  schemes\u2019  impacts  on  the  poor,  the\nquestions to be addressed include (i) who pays for health care and what are the mechanisms for\npayment; (ii) what are the determinants of participation; (iii) what is the service mix and quality of\ncare that participants receive; (iii) how these schemes have worked in terms of targeting, including\npricing; and (iv) how these schemes have affected participants\u2019 use of health care services, health-\nrelated behavior, health status, spending patterns, and income and consumption.\n15.   The TA will consider health service delivery and financing issues, including the following: (i)\nwho are the participants and the mechanisms of payment, (ii) the pricing structure and coverage,\n(iii) the range of care and services provided, (iv) the schemes\u2019 limitations and exclusions, (v) risk\nmanagement steps undertaken, and (vi) procurement arrangements. The interaction of financing\narrangements and the health sector will be examined with focus on (i) the impact of the payment\nschemes on the government\u2019s allocation of resources to the health sector and the rest of the social\nsector,  (ii)  how  the  schemes  have  affected  the  provision  of  health  care  by  nongovernment\nproviders, and (iii) the legal and regulation frameworks that guide health sector activities.\n16.   At the end of the first phase, a roundtable discussion of findings of the country case studies\nwill be held to obtain an initial comparative perspective, to learn from the issues and experience\nfrom the other study countries. This comparative analysis will be a major input to developing the\nregional study and guide. The researchers will review each other\u2019s draft studies and draft topic\nbriefs with a view towards addressing gaps in them and thereby improve their quality.\n17.   The second phase will orient key government personnel in the health and/or economic\nplanning units of the countries participating in this study, as well as representatives of NGOs and\nother agencies, on the experience relating to health finance for the poor. A regional workshop\nmeeting will be organized to share the countries\u2019 experience with modes of health care financing\nand prepare the regional study and guide on health care financing for the poor. The guide will\ninclude the case studies and offer options for optimal coverage of the poor with respect to: (i)\nfinancial sustainability, (ii) financial burden on the client, (iii) public-private partnership, (iv) degree\nof insurance, and (v) level of primary and curative care given. This document and the topic briefs\nwill be posted on ADB\u2019s web site and translated into key languages of the region.\n18.   Five countries will be included in the study: Bangladesh, Mongolia, Pakistan, Papua New\nGuinea, and Viet Nam. These countries have been selected because of their experience that\ninclude a variety of instruments for meeting the health needs of the poor and that may be replicable\nelsewhere. They are also in diverse stages of economic and political development. Bangladesh", "5\nhas numerous community health initiatives sponsored by nongovernment organizations (NGOs).\nPakistan has nongovernment providers that offer sustainable quality health care. Papua New\nGuinea has decentralized health services to local-level governments. Viet Nam has recently shifted\nfrom a highly subsidized system into one requiring greater out-of-pocket payments. Mongolia is a\ntransition economy that initiated a national insurance program in 1994.\nC.   Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n19.   The total cost of the TA is estimated at $450,000 equivalent. The amount will cover the cost\nof international and domestic consultants\u2019 services, international and domestic travel, studies,\nregional workshop, monitoring, and consultations. ADB will provide $400,000 on a grant basis from\nthe Japan Special Fund funded by the Government of Japan. The participating DMCs will provide\n$50,000 in kind through the provision of information, statistics, and data on financing schemes;\nadministrative support; and staff time of personnel. Cost estimate details are in Appendix 2.\nD.   Implementation Arrangements\n20.   The TA study will be coordinated by ADB\u2019s Education, Health and Population Division\n(West) and supported by a small group of ADB health specialists and economists. Concurrence\nfrom the governments of the study countries has bee obtained. The TA will coordinate closely with\nthe World Health Organization (WHO) and World Bank; the ministries of health of the study\ncountries and other aid agencies will be consulted. ADB will finance the study of five countries.\nWHO will offer technical advice and make available relevant documents and materials. World Bank\nwill be undertaking complementary parallel efforts in the People\u2019s Republic of China, Indonesia,\nPhilippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam. Terms of reference, study frameworks, study materials, and\nrelated documents pertaining to these parallel studies will be shared between ADB and World\nBank.\n21.   The TA implementation will take 11 months, starting in August 2001 and finishing in June\n2002. The first phase of the TA is expected to take six months, and the second phase, five months.\nADB will engage individually one international consultant for four person-months, and five domestic\nconsultants for three person-months each, every one an expert in health financing in her or his\ncountry of coverage. The international consultant will be the team leader and will write the final\nreport and recommendations on policy design in health financing for the poor, with input from the\nother team members. The outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. The\nconsultants will be engaged individually by ADB in accordance with the Guidelines on Use of\nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  on  the  engagement  of  domestic\nconsultants, using simplified technical proposal procedures. Consultants will serve as workshop\nfacilitators and/or resource speakers.\nIV. THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION\n22.   The  President,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  by  the  Board,  has  approved  the\nprovision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of\n$400,000 for a Regional Study of Health Care Financing for the Poor and hereby reports such\naction to the Board.", "6\nAppendix 1, page 1\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK\nDesign Summary Performance Targets Monitoring Mechanisms Assumptions & Risks\nGoal\n\u2022 Support the efforts \u2022 DMCs are able to \u2022 Demographic and \u2022 Continued political\nof developing meet the health needs health surveys. commitment to\nmembers countries of a greater number of increasing the poor\u2019s\n(DMCs) to increase poor people. access to health\naccess to quality services.\nbasic health \u2022 Policy and program\nservices by the designers use the\npoor by putting in technical assistance\nplace more (TA) outputs for\nequitable health planning and design\nfinancing schemes. of health care\nfinancing for the poor.\n\u2022 DMCs will conduct\nregular surveys to\ngauge the change in\nthe poor\u2019s health and\neconomic status.\nObjectives\n\u2022 Identify sustainable \u2022 Five health financing \u2022 Report on the initial \u2022 Health care financing\nhealth financing schemes in five researchers\u2019 workshop initiatives are\nschemes that serve countries are identified relating to health available to consider.\nthe health needs of as promising in terms schemes in each \u2022 Documentation, data,\nthe poor. of meeting the health country. and research papers\nneeds of the poor and are available for\nsustainability. review.\n\u2022 Analyze and \u2022 Information relating to \u2022 Monthly progress \u2022 Country health\nconsolidate the these schemes are reports of the personnel, health\nresults of the documented, consultants researchers, and\nstudies and compiled, and \u2022 First drafts of country personnel of selected\nproduce \u201cuser analyzed. case studies and schemes appreciate\nfriendly\u201d \u2022 Successful elements country briefing notes. the study and willingly\nrecommendations of schemes are \u2022 Frequent discussions. extend their\ndocumenting best examined through \u2022 Regional workshop assistance to the\npractices. comparative analysis. draft of case studies consultants/\n\u2022 Publish a user-friendly and country briefs. researchers.\nregional study and \u2022 Draft of regional study\nguide for designing and guide.\nhealth care financing \u2022 Feedback from officials\nfor the poor. of Asian Development\nBank (ADB), World\nBank (WB), and World\nHealth Organization\n(WHO).\n\u2022 Inform health \u2022 Key health policy \u2022 Feedback from the \u2022 Key country health\nplanners about makers and decision attendees of the and poverty reduction\nalternative health makers have a better regional workshop. personnel attend the\nfinancing understanding of \u2022 Report on the activities workshop.\narrangements and alternative health and proceedings of the\ndesign of optimal financing schemes that regional workshop.\nhealth coverage could be potentially\nsystems for the used for serving the\npoor. health needs of the\npoor.\n(Reference in text: page 1, para. 2)", "7\nAppendix 1, page 2\nDesign Summary Performance Targets Monitoring Mechanisms Assumptions & Risks\nOutputs\n\u2022 Country case \u2022 5 country case studies \u2022 Monthly progress report \u2022 Country health\nstudies. that document, collate, from each consultant. officials and health\nreview, and analyze \u2022 Report on consultants\u2019 researchers\ninformation on health roundtable discussion. appreciate the study\nschemes with focus on \u2022 First drafts of country and willingly extend\nthe poor and case studies and their assistance and\nsustainability, including country briefing notes. input to the\n\u2022 Feedback from officials consultants.\n(i)  financial burden on of governments, ADB,\nthe poor, including WB, and WHO.\npricing and\nsubsidies;\n(ii)  level and quality of\ncare to the poor;\n(iii) health outcomes and\nexpenditures on\nbasic human needs;\n(iv) coverage of services\nand population\ngroups;\n(v) sustainability,\nprocurement, and\nrisk management;\n(vi) conditions and\nexclusions;
