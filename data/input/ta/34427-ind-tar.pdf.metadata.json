", " \nI.  INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  An effective secured transactions1 regime has a fundamental role to play in a financial \nsystem.  It can ensure enhanced access to credit by various sectors of the economy that have \npreviously been excluded or have had only limited access to credit by expanding the pool of \nassets that can be used as collateral.  A secured transactions regime can also contribute to \nstronger monitoring of corporate governance by creditors, improved transparency in determining \nthe creditworthiness of debtors, and increased certainty in determining claimants to collateral, all \nof  which  promote  access  to  credit  and  allow  credit  to  be  extended  on  better  terms.  \nFurthermore,  a  secured  transactions  regime  can  facilitate  diversification  of  credit  risk  and \nfinancial intermediation by encouraging nonfinancial creditors like merchants, dealers, traders, \nand manufacturers and a more competitive credit market.2   A modern secured transactions \nregime also supports reduction of transaction costs and improved access to credit by fostering \nefficient out-of-court creditor-initiated enforcement. \n \n2.  Building on long-standing interest in secured transactions law reform in India as reflected \nin the Rajamannar Committee Report of 1977, Indian policymakers participated in the Joint \nSymposium  on  Secured  Transactions  and  Insolvency  Law  Reform  hosted  by  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) in Manila in October 1999. During the Country Programming Mission \nfor India in 2000, the Ministry of Finance of the Government of India (MOF) requested ADB \ntechnical assistance (TA) for developing a computerized registry system for movable property in \nIndia based on a suitable legal framework for secured transactions. \n \n3.  Constructive dialogue between ADB and MOF took place in 2000 and in 2001 on the \nparameters of ADB TA for a registration system for secured transactions.  MOF\u2019s budget \nspeech of February 2002 included reference to introduction of a bill for strengthening creditors\u2019 \nrights and security enforcement by banks and financial institutions.  ADB has received formal \nconfirmation from the Government on the purpose, output, methodology, key activities, cost \nestimates, and implementation arrangements for this TA to assist in the establishment of a \nsuitable legal framework for secured transactions and a subsequent computerized registration \nsystem.  The TA framework is provided in Appendix 1. \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  A modern legal framework for secured transactions will support the comprehensive \ntaking of security interests irrespective of legal form.3  This will, for example, permit individuals, \npartnerships, and other entities that are not companies to obtain effective access to credit based \non security interests in movable property. This is important to rural and urban small and medium \nsized enterprises, microfinance institutions, and \u201cnew economy\u201d start-ups, all of which can make \na potentially key contribution to economic growth and poverty reduction in India. \n                                                 \n1  A secured transaction is any transaction, regardless of its form, that is intended to create a security interest in \npersonal property or fixtures, including goods, documents, and other intangibles.  A security interest is a right given \nto one party in the asset of another party to secure payment or performance of an obligation.  Collateral constitutes \nthe assets over which security is granted.  \n2  ADB. 2000. Secured Transactions Law Reform in Asia: Unleashing the Potential of Collateral, Law and Policy \nReform at the ADB, Volume II, Preface. Manila. \n3  The  Rajamannar  Committee  report  described  the  various  inadequacies  of  the  current  Indian  legal  regime \ngoverning secured transactions. ", "  2   \n \n5.  A  modern  secured  transactions  legal  regime  in  India  will  promote  comprehensive \nregistration of all security interests irrespective of their legal form.4  An effective legal regime for \nthe creation, perfection, and enforcement of security interests, including the publicizing of all \nsecurity interests in movable property, will enhance access to credit by debtors.  This is due to \nthe  fact  that  comprehensive  registration  eliminates  the  uncertainty  for  third  party  creditors \nseeking to review the creditworthiness of a debtor against a backdrop of prior security interests \nin a particular legal form that did not have to be publicly registered.  In addition, comprehensive \nregistration of all security interests will lead to a transparent framework for publicizing them, \nthereby reducing dilatory and corruption-prone transactions that avoid whatever requirements \napply. \n \n6.  Due consideration by a revised secured transactions law for self-help enforcement of \nsecurity  interests,  with  appropriate  procedural  safeguards  for  debtors,  will  make  movable \nproperty an attractive source of collateral for credit by providing for enforcement of security \ninterests without necessarily taking recourse to the courts in an already overburdened judicial \nsystem.     \n \n7.  Based on such a modern legal platform, India can develop a computerized registration \nsystem, based on a first-to-file system, that is accessible by the public and supported by proper \nregulations and operating procedures.   By giving potential creditors who turn to registries for \ninformation about other possible claimants to the collateral the confidence that they can protect \ntheir own security interests and obtain reliable data on prior security interests, such a registry \nsystem can reduce transaction costs for secured credit and significantly increase the speed of \nsecured transactions.  Without such an effective registry system, no law on security interests, no \nmatter how modern, can deliver on the potential economic benefits of nonpossessory secured \ncredit. \n \n8.  Finally  a  modern  secured  transactions  regime  will  be  an  important  complementary \nreform to India\u2019s plan to establish asset management companies for nonperforming loans of \nbanks and financial institutions. \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n9.  The TA will aim to improve the legal framework for secured transactions by providing (i) \ninput and assistance to MOF on all aspects of legal reform options for secured transactions; (ii) \nassistance on evaluation of and consensus building for a modern legal framework for secured \ntransactions  and  a  modern  registry  system;  and  (iii)  harmonization  of  a  modern  secured \ntransactions regime with laws on social protection of debtors, including consumer protection \nlaws. \n \n____________________ \n \n4  Conventional forms of security interest include (i) security interests strictly understood (e.g., different pledges, \nwhich are property in the possession of the creditor; company charges; hypothecations; and mortgages, which are \nproperty in the possession of the debtor), (ii) hybrid security interests (e.g., conditional sales with retention or \nreversion of title), and (iii) security interests created under contract law (e.g., assignment of rights to accounts \nreceivable to secure a loan). \n   ", "3 \n10.  The TA will also support the architecture for establishment of a computerized registration \nsystem  that  is  comprehensive;  self-sustaining;  reliable;  and  easily,  cheaply,  and  quickly \naccessible by the public through assistance on (i) overall design of the registration system, and \n(ii) capacity building and training in the establishment and operation of the registration system.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  To accomplish its objectives, the TA will have two phases: \n \nPhase I :   Reform of the Legal and Regulatory Framework \n \n12.  MOF,  with  the  assistance  of  consultants  engaged  under  the  TA,  will  provide  the \nprinciples of a modern secured transactions regime, the nature of amendments to current laws \non secured transactions in India required for such a modern secured transactions regime, \nharmonization of laws on social protection of debtors under a secured transactions regime, and \ncase studies under current Indian secured transactions laws.  These will be discussed at a \nseries of consensus-building workshops that will consider the opinion of relevant stakeholders, \nincluding government agencies, bankers, lawyers, representatives from the private sector, and \nthe public sector.   \n \n13.  ADB,  in  consultation  with  MOF,  will  select  a  modern  registration  system  and \naccompanying legal framework for in-depth study together with two or three other registration \nsystems for comparison.  MOF, in consultation with ADB, will select up to three key persons \nfrom the Government or public sector to attend the study of registration systems.  In addition, \nthe members of the study tour will include private sector representatives on a self-financed \nbasis. \n \n14.  Following the study of registration systems, MOF, in consultation with ADB, will evaluate \nat a workshop the kind of legal and regulatory framework needed to support a modern registry \nsystem. \n \n15.  MOF, with input from consultants provided under the TA, will undertake reform of the \nlegal  framework  for  secured  transactions  necessary  to  support  a  modern,  computerized, \nregistration  system,  taking  account  of  (i)  experience  from  other  jurisdictions  that  have \nundertaken such reforms; (ii) legal design input drawn from relevant ADB regional technical \nassistance  reports,  relevant  Indian  legal  reports,  and  input  from  the  consensus-building \nworkshops and campaign and from the evaluation workshop referred to in paras. 12-14 of this \npaper.  All such inputs will be distilled by the consultants into the form of a legal design input \nreport, which will include the draft secured transactions law recommended for India. \n \n16.  For the TA to continue to Phase II, ADB will a determine, in consultation with MOF, that \nreforms to the legal framework sufficient to support a comprehensive, transparent, and effective \nregistration system have been enacted \u2014 measured against the legal design input report. \n \nPhase II : Architecture for Establishment of a Registry System \n \n17.  The consultants will prepare the overall design of a modern registration system based on \nthe reformed legal framework for secured transactions including identification of equipment, \nsoftware,  staffing,  links  to  existing  registries,  fee  structure,  public/private  sector  model \nassessments, training, and public awareness needed to support the introduction of such a \nregistration system. \n ", "  4   \n18.  To build capacity to enable the necessary software for a modern registration system to \nbe developed, the consultants will provide workshops on a simulated registration system based \non the overall design (para. 17), to be held in selected cities such as Bangalore and Hyderabad. \n \n19.  In consultation with MOF, the consultants will design and carry out a comprehensive \ntraining and public awareness program of workshops and seminars that encompasses both the \nreformed secured transactions law and the principles of a modern registration system based on \nthe overall design developed in accordance with para. 17.  Trainees will be selected by MOF in \nconsultation with ADB and the consultants.  \n \n20.  A final tripartite meeting will be held to review the report and the recommendations of the \nconsultants based on the capacity-building workshops and the training and public awareness \nworkshops and seminars, and to assess the TA.  Based on the conclusions reached at the \nmeeting, the consultants will refine and finalize the overall design and the final report.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n21.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $625,000 equivalent, of which the foreign \nexchange cost is estimated at $310,000 and the local currency cost at $315,000 equivalent.  \nADB  will  finance  the  full  foreign  exchange  cost  plus  $190,000  equivalent  of  the  local \nexpenditures, for a total of $500,000 \u2014 split between $250,000 for Phase I and $250,000 for \nPhase II.  The TA will be financed by ADB on a grant basis from the ADB-funded TA Special \nFund. The balance of the costs over and above ADB financing, mainly for counterpart support \nand  secretarial  services,  office  accommodation,  office  equipment  and  supplies, \ncommunications, and such documents and data as are required by the consultants, will be \nprovided by the Government.  Cost estimates are given in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n22.  The Executing Agency will be the Banking Division of MOF.  MOF will designate an \nappropriate official as project director, who will be responsible for managing the day-to-day \nactivities of the TA and for coordinating with other agencies and concerned parties through a \ncommittee of stakeholders.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 3 years and will be \nadministered by ADB\u2019s Office of the General Counsel. \n \n23.  The TA will require the services of about 14 person-months of international consultant \ntime  and  about  20  person-months  of  domestic  consultant  time  with  expertise  in  secured \ntransactions law and design, and implementation and operation of computerized registration \nsystems for secured transactions.  The consultants in Phase I will be a team of individual \ninternational and domestic consultants selected on an individual basis in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the \nengagement of domestic consultants.  The consultants in Phase II will be a team of international \nand domestic consultants who will be engaged through an international consulting firm, using a \nsimplified technical proposal, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \nand other arrangements satisfactory to the ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants.  \nThe consultants in Phase I and Phase II will operate as one larger team.  The terms of \nreference  for  the  consultants  in  Phase  I  and  in  Phase  II  are  contained  in  Appendix  3.  \nEquipment  required  under  the  TA  will  be  procured  by  the  international  consultants  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \n \n   ", "5 \nIV.
