INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will help Mongolia respond to the \ngender impacts of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak and associated measures in \nplace to reduce rates of transmission, with the aim of mitigating negative consequences on \nwomen and the most vulnerable, particularly domestic violence. The TA will support the Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB) Strategy 2030 and its operational priority of accelerating the progress \nin gender equality.1 The TA is consistent with the objectives of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy \nfor Mongolia, 2017\u20132020.2  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The COVID-19 pandemic remains a matter of serious concern and the Government of \nMongolia has taken strong actions to respond to the outbreak and reduce the risk of community \ntransmission. Following the initial outbreak of COVID-19 in the People\u2019s Republic of China, the \nMongolian National Security Council imposed restrictions on air travel, movement across borders, \nand school closures on 31 January 2020. Additional restrictions imposed during 21 February \n2020\u201322 March 2020 remain in place, including the cancellation of public events, mandatory \nquarantine measures, and restrictions on public venues and nonessential retail services. \n \n3.  COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound socio-economic impact. The crisis has affected \nmen and women in different ways. While men appear to be at higher risk of infection and health \nimpacts,3 women are facing greater hardship related to (i) their predominant role in health sector \noperations (in Mongolia they make up 82% of the health workforce); and (ii) their participation in \nmicroscale, family, and sole-entrepreneur-owned businesses, which have been affected by \nmobility restrictions and a consequent reduction in demand for services.4 ADB is conducting an \nongoing rapid assessment of the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis on micro, small- and medium-\nsized enterprises in Mongolia. Preliminary results reveal that 97% are facing negative impacts, \nwith more than 90% of microenterprises reporting a sharp decline in revenues. COVID-19 mobility \nrestrictions have impacted the unpaid and informal economy disproportionately, affecting women \nto a larger degree. Women who have inched out of poverty also risk falling back into vulnerable \nsituations.5 \n \n4.  The pandemic, including its severe economic impacts, have had a strong impact on \ndomestic violence. Police records for the capital city of Ulaanbaatar indicated a 63% increase in \nreported cases from 1,900 during the first quarter (Q1) of 2019 to 3,100 during Q1 2020. Most of \nthese cases (77%) included physical violence, about 90% were committed in a household setting, \nand women constituted 93% of the victims. During this time, police hotlines reported a 19% \nincrease in calls and nongovernment-run helplines reported a 30% increase, while reduced \nmobility during the quarantine period and social distancing measures have resulted in victims of \ndomestic violence having reduced options for support and counseling. It is likely that many have \n \n1  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. Manila. \n2 ADB. 2017.

Nonetheless, the number of victims of domestic \nviolence requesting shelter services increased by more than 50% from about 600 victims during \nQ1 2019 to more than 910 during Q1 2020. Domestic violence survivors suffer a range of serious \nphysical and mental health consequences that require urgent responses, including emergency \nservices, medical and psychological assessments, and immediate shelter options. As demand \nsoars, shelters and one-stop service centers (OSSCs) nationwide are under strain. Challenges \naffecting emergency response services during the pandemic are described in paras. 5\u20136. \n \n5.  Lack of safety protocols and equipment for first response and shelter services. \nMongolia has 14 shelters and 15 OSSCs that provide attention, counseling services, and short-\nterm safe accommodation to victims of domestic violence. All shelters and OSSCs have remained \nopen during the COVID-19 crisis. However, these critical institutions lack all needed personal \nprotective equipment (PPE) to attend to victims in a safe manner. Furthermore, no protocols are \nin place to reduce exposure of current residents to COVID-19 when new victims are received and \nsheltered,  and  the  facilities  have  no  budget  to  purchase  additional  decontamination  and \ndisinfection  materials.  This  situation  puts  first  responders,  including  administrative  police \nassigned to attend to domestic violence cases, at heightened risk of possible exposure and \ncontagion because of lack of basic PPE. \n \n6.  Inadequate capacity to respond to increased demand for hotline services. The \nchannels to respond to increased demand have remained limited to a 24-7 police hotline (107) \ndedicated  to  domestic  violence  emergencies  and  one  domestic  violence  information  and \ncounseling hotline run by the nongovernment organization National Center Against Violence \n(NCAV), which operates from 9 a.m. 6 p.m.6 The sole use of phone-based hotlines, which are \nunable to take multiple calls at once, limits the possibility of victims to reach services during the \nquarantine period, when they are largely confined indoors, sometimes in close proximity to \nperpetrators.  \n \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: adverse impacts of COVID-19 on women, \nparticularly domestic violence, reduced. The TA will have the following outcome: critical response \nmechanisms for domestic violence maintained and preventive action enhanced.7 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n8.  Output 1: Domestic violence response operations supported and shelter capacity \nincreased. Under this output, the TA will support the safety of first responders during the \npandemic through the procurement of (i) basic PPE, first aid kits, and disinfection items for all 14 \nshelters and 15 OSSCs, as well as first responder police units across the country; (ii) three mobile \nultrasound units for forensic examination of victims; and (iii) information technology hardware (e.g., \ndesktop computers) to enhance digital counseling operations. \n \n \n6 To address the increase in the number of calls requesting information and counseling services during the COVID-19 \ncrisis, the United Nations Population Fund is covering the salary of two additional counselors for the NCAV\u2019s hotline, \nensuring it is operational 24-7 during June and July 2020. \n7 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "3 \n9.  Output 2: Prevention awareness and virtual counseling support services provided. \nThe TA will increase the outreach capacity of government and nongovernment organizations to \nprovide information and counseling services that address the needs of victims of domestic \nviolence during the COVID-19 crisis, while increasing public awareness for effective prevention \nand increased reporting. This will be achieved through (i) supporting the expansion of information \ntechnology and digital infrastructure of the National Legal Institute (NLI) and the NCAV (e.g., using \nchatbots)  to  complement  existing  hotlines  and  counselling  services; 8  (ii)  designing  and \nimplementing a multimedia communication campaign targeting people and families at risk of \ndomestic violence with messages designed to prevent domestic violence in the context of the \nCOVID-19 crisis; (iii) responding to increased demand for psychosocial counseling by enhancing \ncapacity during the COVID-19 crisis through the provision of one additional counselor under the \nNCAV for the duration of the TA; (iv) organizing a hackathon to identify innovative digital solutions \nto address new forms of gender-based violence (GBV) such as cyberbullying;9 and (v) conducting \nvirtual training programs for first responders on emergency response in cases of sexual violence, \nfor shelter operators on stress management and mental health, and training of trainers for police \npsychologists. Output 2 is expected to generate valuable lessons for future operations to address \ndomestic violence in Mongolia and Asia and the Pacific. \n \n10.  Output 3: Emergency response mechanism established. This output will support \nservices for strengthening government sex-disaggregated data collection during the COVID-19 \ncrisis, including strengthening the database and data confidentiality mechanisms, monitoring \ncapacity for rapid response, and capturing lessons and impact of TA emergency response actions \nto inform future operations to address domestic violence in the country. This output will be \ndelivered through engagement of individual consultants for monitoring and evaluation. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $440,000 of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The key expenditure items are listed in \nAppendix  2.  The  Government  of  Mongolia  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of \ncounterpart  staff  remuneration,  meeting  venues,  value-added  tax  and  duty  exemptions  for \nimported goods and equipment to be procured under the TA, and other in-kind contributions.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  ADB will administer the TA. ADB\u2019s East Asia Department will select, supervise, and \nevaluate consultants and monitor the quality of their work. The Ministry of Justice and Home \nAffairs (MOJHA) will be the executing agency, and the Secretariat of Coordination Council for \nCrime Prevention (SCCCP) under the MOJHA will be the implementing agency. The SCCCP will \nprovide guidance to consultants and day-to-day oversight for the successful implementation of \nthe TA. The SCCCP will form and chair a technical advisory group to peer-review the work of \nconsultants. The technical advisory group will be composed of senior officials from the MOJHA \nand civil society organizations. It will meet at least three times during TA implementation. The NLI \nand the NCAV will confirm the contents of frequently asked questions that will be provided to the \nchatbots developed under the TA. \n \n \n8  Chatbots are artificial intelligence software applications based on natural language processing and used to conduct \nan on-line chat conversation via text or text-to-speech, in lieu of providing direct contact with a live human agent. \n9  Hackathon is an event in which people work together to create a solution to an existing problem using technology.  \n ", "4 \n13.  The TA will be implemented from 1 July 2020 to 31 December 2021.

Consulting services. ADB will engage a consulting firm to deliver activities under outputs \n1 and 2. The firm will (i) provide content and message development and public awareness-raising \nactivities;  (ii)  procure  medical  items  for  emergency  response  and  information  technology \nhardware and equipment to increase outreach and access to digital counseling services; (iii) plan \nand organize one hackathon; (iv) provide virtual training on sexual violence case management; \nand (v) provide virtual psychosocial and mental health training to staff of shelters and OSSCs, \ndesign stress management training materials, and deliver training of trainers for psychologists of \npolice departments. ADB will engage individual consultants for monitoring and evaluation of the \nTA, and development of a knowledge product. Non-consulting services will be procured from a \nvendor to deliver chatbot development for the NLI and NCAV. Partial lump-sum contracts using \nperformance (output)-based terms of reference will be used as appropriate. ADB will engage the \nconsultants  and  non-consulting  services  following  the  ADB  Procurement  Policy  (2017,  as \namended from time to time) and its associated project administration instructions and/or staff \ninstructions.10 ADB will evaluate the TA progress through semiannual review missions based on \nthe performance targets and indicators defined in the design and monitoring framework (Appendix \n1).  \n \n15.  Procurement. The TA will procure items to increase the safety of first responders, staff \nand residents of shelters as well as to enhance the response capacity of forensic services and \nincrease the outreach of counseling services. These items include PPE, mobile ultrasound units, \n \n10 Terms of Reference (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n ", "5 \ninfrared  thermometers,  disinfection  materials,  and  information  technology  hardware  and \nequipment. The consulting firm will undertake procurement under the guidance of ADB. The \nprocured PPE and medical equipment will be handed over to the MOJHA, relevant ministries, and \nagencies, which will deliver them to the target beneficiaries (e.g., shelters, OSSCs, police \ndepartments, and the National Forensic Institute, under the MOJHA) during TA implementation. \nThe TA will cover the delivery cost of goods to  14 shelters and 15 OSSCs through land \ntransportation. Information technology hardware and equipment will be transferred to NLI and \nNCAV upon completion of TA activities.  Procurement will follow the ADB Procurement Policy and \nits associated project administration instructions and/or staff instructions. \n \n16.  Prevention awareness and promotion. The multimedia communication campaign will \nprovide practical messaging and promote the GBV digital platform to address (i) increased \nexposure to risks, and the difficulty of GBV survivors and family members to access information \nand support because of quarantine-related lack of mobility; and (ii) increased risk of sexual \nviolence and bullying for adolescents who are spending more time online. The communication \ncampaign will drive traffic to the digital platform and lead people at risk of violence to the options \navailable and accessible to them, depending on their digital capacities, including chatbots, mobile \napplications, private chat groups, websites (i.e., the NCAV and NLI websites), social media pages, \nand other channels, where they can download information.  \n \n17.  Pilot testing of project approach. The TA will pilot test next-generation helplines for \ndomestic violence cases with the establishment of chatbots, to efficiently increase access and \nreach of information, and counseling services for victims of domestic violence. As chatbots are \nprogrammed to communicate without the need of a human operator, their use is expected to \ncontribute to increased availability of human operators to answer emergency and distress calls \nthat require human interaction; nonemergency calls requesting information and counseling will be \nredirected to chatbots. The use of chatbots to increase outreach to victims of domestic violence \nhas been tested in other contexts in Asia and the Pacific with initial good results.11  The chatbot \nwill be programmed to discuss topics and content based on the input of national experts in the \nfields of domestic violence, crime prevention, and legal counseling. The content will go through a \npeer  review  process  involving  the  implementing  agency  and  leading  nongovernment \norganizations in the area of GBV. The pilot will focus on solutions to minimize risks, such as \nstoring a minimum amount of users\u2019 sensitive information; interaction between callers and the \nchatbot will be completely private and data will be encrypted on the server, with no storage or \nretention of any personal data about the user. The MOJHA has confirmed the sustainability of NLI \nchatbot operations and confirmed that chatbots and other software and digital outputs of the TA \nwill be maintained by the NLI after TA completion. Digital contents piloted for the NCAV will be \nscaled up in digital platforms of the domestic violence hotline (107) maintained by the Municipality \nof Ulaanbaatar. Fees related to NLI chatbot usage licenses and all other related fees will be \ncovered by the NLI and MOJHA upon completion of the TA. The pilot activities will not result in \nany potential adverse environmental and/or social impacts.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to the \nGovernment of Mongolia for Addressing and Preventing Domestic Violence in Mongolia during \nthe COVID-19 crisis, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n \n11 The beta version of the #MySis chatbot against GBV, developed by members of the police force in Thailand and \nlaunched in 2019 is an example.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpacts the TA is aligned with: \nAdverse impacts of COVID-19 on women, particularly domestic violence, reduced (defined by TA)    \nPerformance Indicators with  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Reporting  Risks \nOutcome  By 2021:     \nCritical response      Pandemic \nmechanisms for  a.
