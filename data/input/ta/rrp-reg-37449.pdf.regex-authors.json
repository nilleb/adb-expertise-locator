Members are Australia, Fiji Islands, \nKiribati,  New  Zealand,  Papua  New  Guinea,  Samoa,  Solomon \nIslands, and Vanuatu.  \n   \nGuarantors  Kiribati, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, and Vanuatu, on a several \nbasis. \n   \nClassification  Targeting classification: General Intervention \nSector: Transport and Communications \nSubsector: Civil Aviation \nThemes: Sustainable economic growth / Regional cooperation \n   \nEnvironment  Category C \nAssessment  Unlikely to have adverse environmental impacts \n   \nProject Description  The Project will complete the establishment of PASO and make it \nfully operational and able to provide aviation safety and security \nexpertise  to  countries  that  need  it.  The  Project  has  four \ncomponents:  (i)  harmonization  of  aviation  safety  and  security \nregulations, (ii) recertification of airlines, (iii) institutionalization of a \nregional  surveillance  and  inspection  system,  and  (iv) \nrefurbishment of the PASO headquarters. Project outputs include \n(i) updated legislative and regulatory frameworks in each PASO \nmember, (ii) training and capacity building, (iii) airline certifications \nof compliance with international requirements, (iv) national and \nregional minimum required annual inspection plans, (v) technical \nguidance material in each specialized discipline, (vi) an inspection \ndocumentation and issues resolution system, and (vii) completed \naccommodation. The Project will be financed through a regional \nloan  to  PASO,  guaranteed  severally  in  equal  shares  by  four \nguarantor countries.  \n   \nRationale  The PDMCs consist of thousands of islands spread across 30 \nmillion  square  kilometers  of  ocean.  Modern  air  transport  is \nessential for tourism and trade, which will enable economic growth \nand  reduce  poverty.  To  support  this  growth,  air  transport \noperations are required to comply with internationally recognized \nsafety regulation and oversight standards. However, all PDMCs \nface severe financial limits and shortages of skilled personnel to \nperform these essential functions and, consequently, often fail to \nmeet requirements. Noncompliance places safety and security at \nrisk and potentially jeopardizes continued international services.  \n \nIn  recognition  that  regional  cooperation  can  be  an  effective \napproach to safety regulation and oversight, PASO was founded \nto oversee and advise on regional aviation safety and security. ", "  iii\nPASO will create regional capacity and economies of scale but \nrequires  external  assistance  to  become  fully  established  and \noperational. Asian Development Bank (ADB) financing will enable \nthe  PASO  PDMCs  to  achieve  mandatory  compliance  with \ninternational requirements through a cost-effective and financially \nsustainable organization.  \n   \nObjective  The Project\u2019s goal is to ensure that the PDMC aviation sectors \nmeet  all  international  requirements  for  safety  and  security \nregulation  and  oversight.  The  Project's  objectives  are  to  (i) \nharmonize updated legislative and regulatory frameworks in each \nPASO  member  along  with  training  and  capacity  building;  (ii) \nensure compliance with international requirements through airline \nrecertification;  and  (iii)  establish  and  institutionalize  a  regional \nsurveillance  and  inspection  system  by  creating  a  minimum \nrequired annual inspection plan, technical guidance material in \neach  specialized  discipline,  and  a  documentation  and  issue \nresolution system. \n   \nCost Estimates  The total project cost is estimated at $2.1 million equivalent. This \nincludes a foreign exchange cost of $1.4 million (67% of the total \ncost) and a local cost of $0.7 million (33%). It is proposed that \nADB provide a loan of $1.5 million, or 71% of the project cost. The \nPASO members will contribute the remaining $0.6 million, or 29%. \n   \nFinancing Plan  Sources  Foreign  Local  Total \n$\u2019000  Exchange  Currency  Cost \n     \nAsian Development Bank  1,400  100  1,500 \nGovernments\u2019 Counterpart Funds  0  600  600 \nTotal   1,400  700  2,100 \n \nRecurrent costs of the organization, once established, will be met \nthrough revenues for services provided to airlines, airports, and \ncivil aviation authorities in PASO members. \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  ADB will directly provide to PASO a public sector loan of $1.5 \nmillion equivalent from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help \nfinance  the  Project.  The  governments  of  Kiribati,  Papua  New \nGuinea, Samoa, and Vanuatu have each agreed to guarantee \n$375,000 of the loan. The loan will have a 32-year term, including \na grace period of 8 years. The interest rate charged will be 1.0% \nduring the grace period and 1.5% thereafter.  \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  1 November 2005\u201330 April 2011 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 October 2010 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Pacific Aviation Safety Office \n   ", "iv   \nImplementation  The PASO general manager will have overall responsibility for \nArrangements  project  implementation  and  shall  be  responsible  for  ensuring \ncoordination  among  PASO  members.  The  PASO  Council  of \nDirectors,  comprising  representatives  of  PASO  members,  will \nconstitute  the  project  steering  committee,  with  overall \nresponsibility for guiding PASO policy and the Project\u2019s strategic \ndirection. The PASO general manager will be a member of the \nsteering committee. \n   \nProcurement  ADB-financed goods and services will be procured in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Equipment  packages \nvalued  at  $100,000  or  less  will  be  procured  following  ADB\u2019s \nprocedures for direct purchase. Civil works contracts valued at \n$100,000 or less will be procured using local competitive bidding \nprocedures. \n   \nConsulting Services  No consulting services are required under the Project. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The Project will increase aviation safety and security in PASO \nBeneficiaries.  PDMCs to ensure compliance with international standards. It will \nensure  that  laws,  regulations,  technical  documentation,  and \nprocedures are current, compliant with International Civil Aviation \nOrganization  requirements,  and  harmonized  across  the region. \nThe  currently  fragmented  system  will  be  replaced  with  a \nconsistent and proactive operating environment, improving safety \nand reducing costs. It will create economies of scale that will allow \nPASO to become financially self-sustaining, while lowering costs \nand improving service quality. The economic internal rate of return \nis 30%. \n \nThe direct beneficiaries of the Project include the governments of \nthe  PASO  PDMCs,  which  will  be  able  to  rationalize  their  civil \naviation  administrations  and  lower  public  sector  costs;  43  air \ntransport operators with a total of 266 aircraft, employing nearly \n4,000  licensed  personnel,  which  will  enjoy  lower  regulatory \ncompliance  costs  and  more  responsive  services;  and  all  air \ntransport users, who will benefit from higher safety and security \nstandards.  Indirect  beneficiaries  include  employees  and  other \nstakeholders in the tourism industry, who will avoid the potentially \ncatastrophic effects of fewer arrivals caused by a serious safety or \nsecurity incident.  \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The key technical risks are that international requirements will \ncontinue  to  grow  more  complex  and  burden  PASO  and  the \nPDMCs\u2019  small  administrations  and  airlines,  and  that  evolving \nairline fleets will require greater oversight. The financial risks are \nthat  airlines  will  face  increased  service  fees  in  response  to \nchanging requirements, and that counterpart contributions may \nneed to increase. The institutional risks are that governments, \noperators, and international organizations need to increase their \ncooperation to support regulatory reform and harmonization.  ", "  v\n \nIn  all  three  areas,  PASO  has  been  designed  to  adjust  its \noperations,  match  its  capacity  to  demand,  and  maintain  the \ninternational recognition and standing required to mitigate these \nrisks.  Better  efficiency  and  cost-effectiveness,  combined  with \nimproved regulatory oversight and harmonization of the operating \nenvironment, will encourage stakeholder cooperation.  \n \nThe risks are manageable and apply equally to PASO and to the \nalternative  of  continued  outsourcing.  Unlike  the  alternative, \nhowever, PASO is the least-cost solution, offers additional quality \nof service benefits, and can become financially self-sufficient to \nensure that service continues. PASO is, therefore, the preferred \nsolution  because  of  its  cost-effectiveness,  qualitative \nimprovements, and sustainability. \n   \nTechnical Assistance  Technical  assistance  (TA)  is  proposed  to  support  the  regional \nharmonization  of  aviation  safety  and  security  regulations. \nSpecialized  expertise  is  required  for  legislative  and  regulatory \nreview, airline certification inspection, and technical design of the \nguidance material. The total TA amount is $550,000, of which \n$450,000 will be financed on a grant basis from the Cooperation \nFund for Regional Transportation and Financial Security Initiative, \nfunded  by  the  governments  of  Australia,  Japan,  and  United \nStates, and administered by ADB. PASO and its members will \nprovide the remainder in kind. ", " ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Pacific Aviation Safety Office (PASO) for the Establishment of the Pacific Aviation Safety \nOffice Project. The report describes a proposed technical assistance (TA) for Aviation Safety \nLegislative and Regulatory Review, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under \nthe authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve ADB administering the TA.  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n2.  The Pacific developing member countries  (PDMCs) consist of thousands of islands \ncovering 30 million square kilometers of ocean. Modern air transport is essential for tourism and \ntrade, which will enable economic growth and reduce poverty. Air transport operations are \nrequired  to  employ  internationally  recognized  safety  regulations  and  oversight  practices. \nHowever, all the PDMCs face a severe lack of funds and skilled personnel, and consequently \nhave often failed to meet requirements. Noncompliance places safety and security at risk and \npotentially jeopardizes continued international services. \n \n3.  In recognition that regional cooperation can be an effective approach to safety regulation \nand oversight, the aviation ministers of the Pacific Islands Forum mandated the creation of a \ncollaborative  regional  aviation  safety  oversight  program  to  establish  regional  capacity  and \nenable economies of scale through capacity sharing, leading to financial sustainability. Eight \nADB members, including six PDMCs,1 became members of PASO to overcome traditional \nconstraints. PASO will eventually become self-sustaining but requires external assistance to \nbecome fully established and operational. At the request of the aviation ministers, this Project \nwas prepared using ADB TA.2\n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n4.  The extent of aviation activity varies substantially among PASO PDMCs, which are \nhome to 43 air transport operators, with 266 aircraft and nearly 4,000 licensed personnel. \nHowever, the national industries are fragmented. As a result, national capacity for safety and \nsecurity regulation and oversight is difficult to sustain due to diseconomies of scale. Most of \nthese countries have no qualified inspectors in key areas but do have ad hoc contracts for \nservices with established agencies from countries with more advanced aviation sectors. \n \n5.  As a result, national capacity for safety and security oversight, and the legislative and \nregulatory  frameworks  to  facilitate  it,  are  usually  inadequate.  Audits  conducted  under  the \nUniversal  Safety  Oversight  Audit  Program  (USOAP)  of  the  International  Civil  Aviation \nOrganization  (ICAO)  have  revealed  severe  deficiencies  in  meeting  its  standards  and \nrecommended practices (SARPs), making international air travel less safe and secure than it \nshould be.  \n \n6.  Common  deficiencies  in  these  countries  include  noncompliant  and  badly  outdated \nlegislation and regulations, operational systems and procedures that do not ensure thorough \noversight, incomplete technical guidance materials, under-resourced and poorly performing civil \naviation  administrations  (CAAs),  a  shortage  of  qualified  technical  personnel,  and  a  nearly \n                                                 \n1 Fiji Islands, Kiribati, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu; plus Australia and New Zealand. \n2 ADB. 2003. Regional Technical Assistance on Civil Aviation Safety and Security. Manila (TA 6119-REG, approved \non 25 August 2003). ", "2 \ncomplete inability to license personnel and certify airlines. Since all these countries depend on \ntheir aviation industries to support tourism, trade, and economic growth, and all are signatories \nto the Convention on International Civil Aviation (the Chicago Convention), improvements are \nurgently required to comply with the convention and continue to support economic development. \n \n7.  Although national airlines and administrations in the PASO PDMCs are small, they \noperate in an international environment with very strict safety and security requirements. They \noperate  sophisticated  modern  aircraft  to  major  airports  in  Australia,  Canada,  Japan,  New \nZealand, and United States. Every aspect of their operations must meet the same international \nstandards as huge global airlines, but without the advantages of the depth and resources of \nlarger airlines.  \n \n8.  In response to these needs, PASO has been formally established, though not yet made \noperational, in Port Vila, Vanuatu. Overall guidance, strategy, policy, and problem resolution are \nprovided  by  the  Council  of  Directors,  which  represents  PASO  member  governments  and \nincludes associate members from the aviation industry, multilateral agencies, and established \nsafety oversight authorities. \n \n9.  The initial PASO implementation plan, following the approval of aviation ministers of the \nPacific Islands Forum in 2001, led to PASO\u2019s incorporation in Vanuatu in July 2003. The \nmembers expected that the organization would be operational soon after, but activities have not \ncommenced due to a lack of start-up funding. PASO needs to evolve its operational capability \nquickly to create the necessary services and begin generating revenues, eventually becoming \nfinancially self-sustaining, and thus maintaining its members\u2019 commitment. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n10.  The global system of aviation safety and security regulation and oversight is intended to \nmake international air operations safe and efficient by requiring all ICAO members to uniformly \napply the ICAO SARPs. All ICAO members and signatories to the Chicago Convention are \nobligated to secure the highest practical degree of uniformity in regulations, standards, and \nprocedures, and to ensure their effective implementation. A state\u2019s responsibilities under the \nChicago  Convention  (Appendix  4)  include  the  airworthiness  of  aircraft  and  their  correct \noperation,  supervision  of  licensed  personnel,  suitability  of  the  physical  infrastructure  at \naerodromes, and security of all aspects of civil aviation. To carry out these responsibilities, \nICAO  members  must  develop  appropriate  laws,  regulations,  procedures,  personnel,  and \ninstitutions. \n \n11.  PASO PDMCs, however, cannot implement all these aspects of safety regulation and \noversight because they lack resources and have small industries and administrations. As a \nresult, their laws, regulations, and procedures are generally noncompliant, their personnel are \nunderqualified, and their institutions are not fully effective.  \n \n12.  PDMCs have received little external assistance for civil aviation safety and security. The \nEuropean Commission has financed one sizable regional project, and Australia has made two \ndonations directly to PASO (Appendix 5). \n \n13.  Clearly, the regional system must be improved to ensure the continuing viability of \nPacific  aviation.  The  Project  will  develop  cooperative  regional  capacity  for  the  required \nimprovements through PASO. The alternatives to PASO are fully developing each CAA to ", "3 \nprovide independent capacity, or outsourcing most functions to service providers from countries \nwith more advanced aviation sectors.  \n \n14.  Meeting  the  minimum  national  responsibilities  would  require  each  CAA  to  employ \nqualified inspectors in flight operations, airworthiness, aerodromes, and security, and to upgrade \nthe countries\u2019 legislative, regulatory, and institutional frameworks to support these areas. While \nit would be possible to create independent capacity in each PASO PDMC, the small national \naviation sectors do not require full-time activity from each specialist. The net result would be \nexcess capacity and duplication of effort, translating into much higher costs per unit compared \nwith larger industries and administrations. \n \n15.  The PASO PDMCs have addressed this problem by contracting for inspection services \nas needed, mainly from the CAAs of New Zealand and the United Kingdom. This approach has \nbeen  effective  in  responding  to  immediate  needs  by  providing  qualified  inspectors  when \nneeded, but it has not created systematic and institutionalized capacity. Years of reacting to \nproblems  rather  than  proactively  planning  to  avoid  them,  and  continued  poor  results  from \ninternational audits have demonstrated the inadequacy of this ad hoc approach. Although the \neffort could be increased and improved through outsourcing, the ultimate cost would be much \nhigher than either current (and manifestly inadequate) expenditures or a cooperative regional \napproach (Appendix 6).  \n \n16.  These  problems  and  constraints  are  common  to  developing  countries,  which \nincreasingly respond by developing regional capacity. ICAO has created a number of regional \norganizations for cooperative development of operational safety and continuing airworthiness. \nThese do not provide direct oversight services but are coordinating bodies, providing TA to \nCAAs that need to improve their safety and security regulations and oversight capacity. This \napproach would not work in the PASO PDMCs since they either have little or no such capacity \nto develop. The only operational regional organization is the Central American Agency for \nSafety Oversight, which is similar to PASO. There are no equivalent organizations in the Pacific \nregion. \n \n17.  A regional agency could develop shared capacity and become self-sufficient by reducing \nduplication,  creating  economies  of  scale,  harmonizing  regulatory  systems,  sharing  scarce \ntechnically qualified personnel, and thus reducing the unit costs of oversight. For example, \nrather than appointing (and then underutilizing) three specialized national inspectors for each of \nthe five countries that have none, a total of four regional professionals could provide services for \nall. Airlines would save on compliance costs as a harmonized regulatory system would relieve \nthem of the need to operate consistently within multiple national frameworks. Additional benefits \nwould include priority service when safety issues arise, which do not necessarily happen when \noversight is provided by contract agencies, and an enhanced opportunity to transfer skills and \ntrain the various national CAAs because all oversight would be either provided by or controlled \nwithin the region. \n \n18.  PASO can create this regional capacity by appointing an optimal staff complement to \nprovide the required level of service across the PASO PDMCs. Given the anticipated scale of \nthe regional industry by the end of the project period, this would require one flight operation \nspecialist, one airworthiness specialist, a combined aerodrome and security specialist, and a \ngeneral manager qualified in one of the technical areas.  \n \n19.  A cooperative approach is the most effective way to improve air transport safety and \nsecurity in the region. Existing contracting arrangements can meet known national needs but ", "4 \ncannot build the capacity of national CAAs to plan and manage assistance for unknown ones. In \naddition to technical services, PASO will be able to provide policy and operational advice to \ngovernments through the intergovernmental council. It will also improve guidance to the industry \nby documenting a consistent and harmonized regulatory system.  \n \n20.  PASO will be the nucleus of a region-wide initiative. Other PDMCs are expected to join \nPASO  as  needed  and  as  the  organization  demonstrates  its  value  and  capabilities.  Some \ncountries  are  expected  to  use  PASO  services  on  a  contract  basis.  PASO  is  designed  to \naccommodate growth through both mechanisms.  \n \n21.  PASO will eventually become self-sustaining through contributions by its members and \nrevenues generated from services. The bulk of PASO\u2019s funding will come from each member\u2019s \naviation industry through service fees, in the same way that the industry is currently invoiced by \nnational CAAs for services provided under contract by established aviation safety organizations. \nAs PASO will be more efficient and responsive to its members\u2019 needs, it will increase quality \nand  reduce  charges  to  the  industry.  However,  PASO  requires  external  assistance  in  its \ninception phase.  \n \n22.  Air transport is essential to promote tourism, which employs large numbers of women in \nlabor-intensive occupations and contributes up to a quarter of GDP in some PASO PDMCs. By \nensuring that an essential public good is always available to support this key transport sector, \nthe  Project  supports  sustainable economic  growth  and  promotes  the  crosscutting  strategic \ntheme of regional cooperation in ADB's poverty reduction strategy3 and long-term strategic \nframework.4  By  supporting  regional  capacity  building,  the  Project  will  be  important  in \nimplementing the Pacific strategy for 2005\u20132009,5 ADB's subregional strategy and program for \nthe PDMCs.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n23.  PASO was founded in July 2003 as a nonprofit organization, incorporated under the \nlaws of Vanuatu. PASO\u2019s operations were to be governed by the PASO constitution. Because it \nlacked start-up funding, PASO remained an entity in name only. In April 2004, the PASO \nCouncil of Directors determined that PASO should be an international entity, governed by the \nterms of an international treaty, to have the mandate to harmonize the international air and \nsafety operations of its members. By July 2004, the Council of Directors concluded the terms of \nthe treaty to govern PASO\u2019s operations. The Pacific Island Aviation Safety and Security Treaty \n(PICASST) was opened for signature in August 2004 and entered into force with five signatures \nin June 2005. PICASST and the constitution are now in the process of being amended to give \nfull effect to PASO\u2019s international regional character. This process is expected to be complete \nprior to the date of loan effectiveness. \n \n24.  The Project will help PASO become fully operational as an independent regulatory \noversight organization. PASO will provide services to its six founding PDMCs (Fiji Islands, \nKiribati, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu) on a collaborative regional \nbasis. \n                                                 \n3 ADB. 2004.

The Project\u2019s goal is to ensure that the Pacific aviation sector meets all international \nrequirements for safety and security regulation and oversight. PASO will provide advisory, \ncertification, inspection, and surveillance services to the national CAAs and aviation industries \nof its PDMCs. It will identify deficiencies, set out remedial steps, monitor implementation through \nto full compliance, and provide TA to establish the regulatory environment. The professional \nstaff will consist of three internationally qualified technical specialists in airworthiness, flight \noperations, and  security  and  aerodromes,  plus  a  general  manager  qualified  in  one  of  the \ntechnical areas. These activities will replace the current system of ad hoc external contracting \nfrom  the  CAAs  of  countries  with  more  advanced  aviation  sectors.  By  reporting  directly  to \nnational CAAs, PASO is expected to qualitatively improve oversight, which is not possible under \nthe current system. \n \n26.  PASO  operations  will  be  supervised  by  an  intergovernmental  Council  of  Directors, \ncomprising  representatives  of  each  PASO  member,  which  will  set  policy  and  monitor \nimplementation and enforcement of technical findings. The functions of the Council of Directors \nare detailed in the PASO constitution and the PICASST.  \n \n27.  The successful transition of PASO to an operational organization will improve aviation \nsafety and security in a sustainable manner, based on regional cooperation, shared capacity, \nand economies of scale. Within the 5-year project period, PASO is expected to become the \npreferred service provider for regulatory and oversight functions, selected for its professional \nregional staff, lower operating costs, and systematic, focused service to its clients operating in \nthe PDMCs. \n \nB.  Outputs \n28.  The Project has four components, required to make PASO fully operational: (i) creating a \nharmonized regulatory environment, (ii) ensuring airline compliance with international standards, \n(iii) establishing and institutionalizing a regional surveillance and inspection system, and (iv) \nrefurbishing  the  PASO  headquarters.  Project  outputs  include  (i)  updated  legislative  and \nregulatory  frameworks  in  each  member,  (ii)  training  and  capacity  building,  (ii)  airline \ncertifications of compliance with international requirements, (iii) a minimum required annual \ninspection (MRAI) plan, (iv) technical guidance material in each specialized discipline, (v) an \ninspection  documentation  and  issue  resolution  system,  and  (vi)  completed  office \naccommodation. \n \n1.  Component A: Creation of a Harmonized Regulatory Environment \n29.  For  PASO  to  be  effective  and  increase  its  membership,  a  standard  operating \nenvironment must be established across all members. The PASO PDMCs intend to adopt the \nNew Zealand regulations, which are already in partial use in several members. Harmonization \nwill allow full economies of scale related to regional cooperation to develop and is crucial to \nPASO\u2019s success. \n \n30.  The outputs of this component will be (i) adoption and implementation of an updated \noversight system in each PASO PDMC; and (ii) training and capacity building for airlines, \nnational  CAAs,  and  airport  operators.  PASO  will  develop  (i)  surveillance  and  inspection \nprocedures, (ii) certification and licensing procedures, and (iii) technical guidance materials. To ", "6 \nensure  ownership  and  cooperation,  PASO  will  provide  comprehensive  briefings  and  train \nofficials and management of CAAs, airlines, and airports in the new safety and security systems \nand their inspection, surveillance, and certification programs. \n \n2.  Component B: Airline Compliance with International Requirements \n31.  Because the PDMC CAAs are weak, most airlines have been self-regulating for years, \nwithout  sufficient  oversight  to  ensure  compliance  with  ICAO  SARPs.  With  few  exceptions, \ndocumentation on air operator certification is nonexistent, indicating the lack of competent \nsafety  certification  of  airlines  in  the  region.  To  ensure  compliance,  a  comprehensive \nrecertification program is essential to establish a baseline for surveillance and inspection. \n \n32.  This  component\u2019s  output  will  be  certification  of  airline  compliance  with  international \nrequirements.  PASO  staff  will  supervise  certification  audits  in  airworthiness  and  flight \noperations,  using  ICAO  SARPs  in  combination  with  procedures  and  technical  guidance \ndeveloped under component A. Based on PASO recommendations, the PASO PDMCs will \nissue or revalidate the airlines\u2019 air operator\u2019s certificates. \n \n3.  Component C: Regional Surveillance and Inspection System \n33.  A comprehensive surveillance and inspection program, in the form of an MRAI plan, is \nessential to guide PASO operations. The core services that will be included in each country\u2019s \nMRAI  and  provided  by  PASO  technical  staff  include  regulation,  oversight,  and  personnel \nlicensing in flight operations, airworthiness, aerodromes, and security. Implementing the MRAI \nin each country through regular inspections and reporting will comprise about half of all PASO \nactivities. \n \n34.  The outputs of this component will be (i) design and implementation of an MRAI plan for \neach member, covering its CAA, air transport operators, and aerodrome operators; and (ii) \ncreation of an inspection documentation and issue resolution system. A system of circulars and \ndirectives will be required for official communications with members. These are core activities \nexpected of PASO staff, based on the outputs of component A.  \n \n4.  Component D: Completed Office Accommodation \n35.  PASO will be headquartered in Port Vila, Vanuatu. The Government has donated a \nbasic office facility to the Project and provides two administrative staff members as in-kind \ncontributions. Additional furnishings, standard office equipment, and modern communications \nare required to equip this facility. This component\u2019s output will be a completed office facility \nready for occupancy by seven people. Required activities are primarily procurement of furniture \nand equipment and minor building works for renovation.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n36.  Regional cooperation through the Project will enable three special features to emerge: (i) \nincentives for increasing harmonization and membership through \"network benefits\", (ii) benefits \nfrom net positive contributions to regional regulatory and oversight services by the larger and \nbetter-developed national CAAs, and (iii) greater independence and accountability for policy and \nregulatory functions.  \n ", "7 \n37.  Network benefits refer to the increasing value of membership as the organization\u2019s \nscope grows. As harmonization proceeds, and economies of scale decrease the unit costs of \nservice provision, it will become increasingly cost-effective for more countries to join PASO as \ntheir  needs  require  and  as  the  organization  demonstrates  its  value  and  capabilities.  Its \nincreasing scale and scope will enable PASO to reduce the costs to its members of specialized \noutside expertise that may be contracted for infrequent services such as approvals of new \naircraft types or airlines, and engineering support for major modifications or repairs of aircraft.  \n \n38.  The potential for net positive contributions to the regional initiative arises with respect to \nthe CAAs of Fiji Islands and Papua New Guinea, which have large organizations that could \nprovide services to PASO as needed. This will allow regional personnel to become fully qualified \nto international standards and eventually replace international staff.  \n \n39.  Under the existing system, all but two PASO PDMCs6 combine policy, regulatory, and \noperational functions within aviation ministries. All international airlines in PASO PDMCs are \ngovernment-owned, creating potential conflicts of interest. To improve accountability, the PASO \nconstitution and the PICASST delegate ICAO-mandated oversight responsibilities to PASO, \nfacilitating administrative and financial independence.  \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n40.  The total project cost is estimated at $2.1 million equivalent. This includes a foreign \nexchange cost of $1.4 million equivalent (about 67% of the total) and a local cost of $0.7 million \nequivalent (about 33% of the total). Cost estimates include (i) staff costs, including travel, \ntraining, and overheads; (ii) establishment costs of PASO, including communication equipment, \ntechnical resources, and minor renovations; (iii) initial working capital; and (iv) contingencies. \nTaxes are excluded from project cost estimates since PASO is tax exempt in Vanuatu. Cost \nestimates are shown in Table 1 and details are in Appendix 6. \n \nTable 1: Cost Estimates \n($\u2019000) \n \nItem  Foreign  Local  Percentage \nTotal \nExchange  Currency  of Base Cost \nA.

", "8 \nE.  Financing Plan \n41.  ADB will directly provide PASO with a public sector loan of SDR 1,033,000 ($1.5 million \nequivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the Project. The loan will have \na 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, and interest rates of 1.0% during the grace \nperiod and 1.5% thereafter.  \n \n42.  The  governments  of  Kiribati,  Papua  New  Guinea,  Samoa,  and  Vanuatu  will  each \nguarantee one fourth of the total loan amount, equal to SDR258,250 ($375,000 equivalent). \nKiribati, Samoa, and Vanuatu are under category A, and Papua New Guinea is under category \nB2. Each country is eligible for Asian Development Fund (ADF) funding.7  \n \n43.  PASO members will provide $600,000 equivalent in counterpart funding, in the form of \nannual  membership  fees  and  in-kind  contributions  (offices  and  two  administrative  staff \nmembers). The governments will not need to fund any tax liability, as PASO is tax exempt. The \ngovernments are committed to providing timely counterpart funds and have incorporated the \nrequired  amounts  into  their  budgets  beginning  in  financial  year  2003.  Counterpart  funding \nrequirements and debt service on the loan are reasonable compared with each guarantor \ncountry's treasury resources and ongoing commitments to other externally funded projects. \nTable 2 shows the summary financing plan and Appendix 8 presents the detailed plan.  \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($\u2019000) \n \n  Foreign  Local \nTotal Cost  Percentage \nSource  Exchange  Currency \n         \nADB Loan  1,400  100  1,500  71 \nGovernment Counterpart Funds  0  600  600  29 \nTotal Cost to be Financed  1,400  700  2,100  100 \n        Sources: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n44.  ADB financing will bridge the cash-flow gap for PASO until estimated revenues exceed \nestimated costs, 5 years after inception. The balance of the financial requirements for running \nthe organization will be met through revenues generated from services provided to airlines and \nairport operators in PASO members. Service fees will be set to fully recover costs. The two \nPASO members that are not guarantors (Fiji Islands and Solomon Islands) will pay a 10% \npremium on service fees.  \n \n45.  As a loan to an international organization comprising ADB members, and guaranteed \nseverally by ADB members, the proposed financing is classified as a public sector loan. Direct \nlending to PASO is consistent with the ADB Charter, which specifies that ADB may finance \ninternational or regional agencies or entities concerned with economic development of the \nregion.8  PASO  is  a  regional  international  organization  that  will  directly  contribute  to  the \neconomic development of the Pacific region (section V.C.). Access to the ADF for this purpose \nis allowed in its regulations.9\n                                                 \n7 The other two PASO PDMCs will not become guarantors of the loan. The Solomon Islands cannot borrow or take \non contingent liabilities in the near term, following its recent lapse into and recovery from arrears. The Fiji Islands \ndoes not expect to regularly receive services from PASO and is therefore not willing to become a guarantor.  \n8  ADB.  1966.

PASO will be the Project\u2019s Executing Agency. A financial management assessment, \nincluding a review of PASO\u2019s systems for financial and management accounting, reporting, \nauditing, and internal controls, is in Supplementary Appendix A. The PASO Council of Directors \nwill form the project steering committee, which shall have overall responsibility for guiding PASO \npolicy  and  the  strategic  direction  of  the  Project.  The  Council  of  Directors  consists  of  one \nrepresentative from each member government, the Association of South Pacific Airlines, ICAO, \nthe Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat, and the general manager of PASO. The general manager \nshall have overall responsibility for project implementation and for ensuring coordination among \nPASO members.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n47.  The Project is expected to start in November 2005 and end in October 2010. Initial \nactivities, including regulatory harmonization, airline recertification, and design of the regional \nsurveillance program, will be completed in 2006. Field inspections are expected to commence in \nmid-2006 and continue indefinitely. The project period has been designated as 5 years since \nthat  is  when  PASO  is  expected  to  become  financially  self-sustaining.  An  implementation \nschedule is in Appendix 10. \n \n3.  Procurement \n48.  ADB-financed goods and related services will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement. Minor civil works estimated to cost $100,000 or less will be carried \nout under local competitive bidding (LCB) procedures acceptable to ADB. Local contractors \nhave the expertise and capacity to undertake such minor civil works, and since international \ncontractors are unlikely to be interested, the use of LCB is acceptable. In accordance with ADB \nrequirements,  foreign  contractors  may  participate  in  LCB.  Selection  and  engagement  of \ncontractors will be subject to the approval of ADB. Promptly after such award, ADB will be \nfurnished  with  copies  of  the  bid  evaluation  report  and  contract  as  executed.  Equipment \ncontracts estimated to cost $100,000 or less may be directly procured by PASO. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n49.  No consulting services are required under the Project.  \n \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n50.  An imprest account will be established by PASO, at a commercial bank acceptable to \nADB,  immediately  after  loan  effectiveness.  Replenishment  to  the  imprest  account  will  be \nsupported by appropriate withdrawal application and related documentation. The initial amount \nto be deposited in the imprest account will not exceed $150,000 equivalent. The statement of \nexpenditure procedure may be used to reimburse eligible expenditures and liquidate advances \nfor individual payments not exceeding the equivalent of $50,000. Detailed arrangements to \nestablish and operate the imprest account and the statement of expenditure procedure will be in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (January 2001). \n ", "10 \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n51.  PASO will maintain separate project accounts containing detailed descriptions of the \nsources of receipts and expenditures. A full set of financial statements (income statement, \nbalance sheet, and cash flow and related notes) will be prepared. The annual project accounts \nand annual financial statements will be audited by independent auditors acceptable to ADB and \nwill be submitted to ADB not later than 6 months after the end of the fiscal year to which they \nrelated. PASO was informed about ADB\u2019s policy on submission of audited financial statements \nand possible penalties for delays in submission. \n \n52.  PASO  will  prepare  and  submit  to  ADB  quarterly  progress  reports  on  financial \nsustainability  and  regional  cooperation  including  (i)  actual  revenue  generation  against \nprojections,  (ii)  regulatory  harmonization,  and  (iii)  prospects  for  growth  of  services  and \nmembership.  The  reports  will  identify  problems  and  difficulties  encountered  during \nimplementation  and  summarize  the  Project\u2019s  financial  accounts  consisting  of  expenditures \nduring the reporting period, year to date, and total to date. A project completion report will be \nprovided no later than 3 months after project completion. \n \n7.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n53.  The project performance monitoring indicators that have been agreed on during project \npreparation include national legislative and regulatory improvements, technical certifications, \ninspection schedules, organizational financial performance, and ultimately full compliance with \nICAO SARPs. The relevance and practicability of data collection for the proposed measures \nhave been confirmed with PASO and the governments of its PDMCs. At the beginning of the \nProject,  PASO  will  develop  comprehensive  procedures  to  systematically  generate  data  on \ninputs and outputs of the four project components and the agreed-on indicators to be used to \nmeasure project impacts. PASO will refine the design and monitoring framework, confirm the \nachievable goals, refine the monitoring and recording arrangements, and establish systems and \nprocedures no later than 6 months after loan effectiveness. \n \n54.  Under the design and monitoring framework, PASO will report on baseline and progress \ndata  at  the  requisite  time  intervals,  and  analyze  and  consolidate  the  data  through  its \ndocumentation,  issue  resolution,  and  management  information  systems.  The  project \nperformance monitoring system will be flexible enough to adopt remedial action for project \ndesign,  schedules,  activities,  and  development  impacts.  PASO  will  monitor  and  assess \nactivities, and report quarterly to ADB on the Project\u2019s implementation and financial aspects to \nensure that progress and impacts are monitored and reported in line with ADB requirements. \n \n8.  Project Review \n55.  Regular ADB review missions are envisaged, and a midterm review, including ICAO \nparticipation, will be undertaken approximately 2 years after project implementation begins. The \nreview  will  include  a  detailed  evaluation  of  the  scope,  implementation  arrangements,  and \nachievement of scheduled targets; progress on future growth of activities; and analysis of \nfeedback from project performance monitoring. \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n56.  A harmonized operating environment will produce benefits broader than those accruing \nto PASO members, particularly for travelers and airlines of major countries serving the Pacific ", "11 \nislands. Because of the positive externalities involved, it is appropriate to supplement project \nactivities through external TA. In conjunction with the Project, an advisory TA is therefore \nproposed to provide specialized expertise to support specific project inception activities.  \n \n57.  TA for aviation legislative and regulatory review will provide legal and regulatory advice, \ntechnical support to audit airlines for recertification, and information systems development. This \nTA is required to supplement the technical capacity of PASO staff for one-time activities to \nsupport the inspections and systems design. \n \n58.  Consulting  services  will  be  provided  to  review  and  revise  national  legislation  and \nregulations, provide specialized technical support for airworthiness and flight operation audits, \ndesign a database system, and recommend ways to implement the Project. The Project will \nthen result in the adoption and implementation by PASO staff, CAAs, and governments of the \nTA recommendations.  \n \n59.  The  total  TA  amount  is  $550,000,  of  which  the  Cooperation  Fund  for  Regional \nTransportation and Financial Security Initiative (a multi-donor umbrella facility funded by the \ngovernments of Australia, Japan, and United States) will finance $450,000 on a grant basis to \nbe administered by ADB. PASO and its members will provide the remainder in kind. Twelve \nperson-months of international and six person-months of domestic consulting services will be \nrequired. Selection and recruitment of consultant services will be undertaken in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB on \nthe engagement of domestic consultants. Details are in Appendix 11. \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n60.  The Project will result in the Pacific aviation sector meeting all international requirements \nfor civil aviation safety and security regulation and oversight. The establishment of a single \nregional organization that replaces and updates the system of fragmented national authorities \nwill  create  economies  of  scale  that  will  allow  the  organization  to  become  financially  self-\nsustaining while lowering costs and improving service quality.  \n \n61.  The Project\u2019s direct beneficiaries include the governments of the PASO PDMCs, which \nwill be able to rationalize their CAAs and lower public sector costs; 43 commercial air transport \noperators operating a total of 266 aircraft and employing nearly 4,000 licensed personnel, who \nwill enjoy lower regulatory compliance costs and more responsive services; and all users of air \ntransport, who will benefit from higher safety and security standards. Indirect beneficiaries \ninclude stakeholders in the tourism industry, and those who depend on their earnings, which will \navoid the potentially catastrophic effects of fewer arrivals caused by a serious safety or security \nincident.  \n \nA.  Institutional Reform \n62.  Aviation safety and security regimes in the PASO PDMCs are fragmented, incomplete, \nand out of date. Many airlines are self-regulating and national administrations lack the tools to \nsupervise them according to their international responsibilities. The Project will ensure that laws, \nregulations,  technical  documentation,  and  procedures  are  up-to-date,  compliant  with  ICAO \nrequirements,  and  harmonized  across  the  region.  Airlines  will  face  a  consistent  operating \nenvironment in all countries, thus improving safety and reducing costs. Alignment of national \nand international responsibilities is mandated through the PICASST. \n ", "12 \n63.  National administrations will benefit from higher-quality services than available through \nexisting  ad  hoc  arrangements.  Although  these  inspectors  are  technically  competent,  they \nprovide services only when contracted. National CAAs do not have the technical expertise to \nplan and manage their assistance and, as a result, often react only after problems become \napparent. PASO will become a source of dedicated expertise that will provide administrative \nbackup to client governments and ensure oversight is planned and implemented proactively. \nSince PASO is a regionally controlled international organization mandated by an international \ntreaty, its credibility and stability are safeguarded.  \n \nB.  Technical Impacts \n64.  A major feature of PASO\u2019s regulatory approach will be a shift away from a reactive and \n\"forensic\" oversight that attempts to find errors in every detail of operations after they have \noccurred and creates incentives for avoidance through its adversarial nature. The Project will \ninstead rely on proactive safety management systems that must be adhered to by airlines and \ninspectors  alike.  Such  systems,  when  implemented  correctly,  place  the  responsibility  for \ncompliance at appropriate points in the aviation industry, create incentives for cooperation to \navoid errors in the first place, and can be audited effectively by a regional team.  \n \n65.  Compliance  and  enforcement  will  be  enhanced  through  three  mechanisms:  (i) \nharmonization across all members through component A, which will introduce stricter SARPs \nand make compliance more consistent and transparent to governments and operators; (ii) \nalignment  of  national  and  international  responsibilities  through  the  PICASST  and  PASO \nmembership; and (iii) regular ICAO USOAP audits that mandate an international survey of \ncompliance.  Since  the  risk  of  continued  poor  enforcement  includes  loss  of  air  services, \ngovernments and operators will have powerful incentives to improve compliance. \n \n66.  Every country with an aviation industry must ensure regulation and oversight in four \ntechnical disciplines, yet five PASO PDMCs do not need a full-time expert in any of these areas. \nWith the exception of the Fiji Islands and Papua New Guinea, the PASO PDMCs need a total of \nfour full-time technical experts. Centralizing expertise in a regional organization will create \nsignificant  economies  of  scale  by  eliminating  duplication  of  services  and  administrative \noverheads, and by making efficient use of highly qualified but scarce human resources. \n \nC.  Economic Aspects \n67.  PASO  provides  the  least-cost  way  to  improve  safety  and  security  regulation  and \noversight in its PDMCs. In aggregate, these cost savings are equivalent to 14% per year when \ncompared with ad hoc contracting, with a net present value of about $573,000 over a 20-year \nplanning period. The resulting economic internal rate of return is 30%. \n \n68.  The Project\u2019s wider economic benefit will be that airlines continue to offer services to and \nfrom PASO PDMCs. Without the Project, these countries will most probably continue to fail to \nmeet  ICAO  SARPs  and  have  their  noncompliance  recorded  in  ICAO  audit  reports.  In  the \nabsence of timely and credible efforts to remedy safety and security deficiencies, international \nairlines  (pushed  by  their  insurers  and  aircraft  lessors)  may  withdraw  services  from  these \ncountries. Countries with more advanced aviation sectors may deny access to airlines from \nPDMCs because of safety and security concerns, as recently happened to one PDMC airline for \nlack of mandated safety equipment.  \n ", "13 \n69.  It is difficult to quantify the economic benefits of compliance with international standards \nthrough improved safety and security regulation and oversight, since the impact of the Project is \nto reduce the probability of a serious incident of unknown frequency and magnitude. However, \nsome  indications  of  the  potential  impacts  of  noncompliance  are  provided  by  comparable \nexperiences.10 Major international air disasters cause about a 10% decline in aviation in ADB \nDMCs for about a year, and major security concerns have resulted in short-term 20% declines. \nAfter the coup d'etat in the Fiji Islands in May 2000, security concerns caused an immediate \n25% fall in international visitor arrivals, which did not recover to their prior levels until 4 years \nlater. Since tourism is responsible for about 20% of the Fiji Islands\u2019 GDP, this was equivalent to \nan average loss of 5% of GDP per year.  \n \n70.  The potential impact of a major aviation incident that evenly affected the PASO PDMCs \ncould thus be estimated at a 10% decline in visitor numbers for a year, equivalent to a fall of 2% \nof their combined GDP, or a loss of about $135 million if all countries were affected equally. \nDenial of international services could have an even greater impact. Given that tourism employs \nlarge  numbers  of  low-skilled  workers,  including  a  high  proportion  of  women,  the  potential \nnegative social impacts would be significant and widespread. According to this estimate, PASO \nwould only need to avert one serious incident during the Project to maintain a benefit\u2013cost ratio \nmuch greater than 1.  \n \nD.  Financial Aspects \n71.  PASO is expected to become financially self-sufficient 5 years from the inception of full \noperations. It will do so while charging lower service fees on an equivalent basis than is possible \nthrough ad hoc contracting. Since existing oversight and regulation are funded on a fee-for-\nservice basis, airlines and airport operators will also experience financial benefits. \n \nE.  Regional Cooperation \n72.  PASO is the first example of a regional organization that PDMCs have been willing to set \nup on a self-financing basis without ongoing donor grants. It is likely to serve as a model for \nintergovernmental  regional  cooperation,  particularly  in  transportation  and  regulation \ninfrastructure and services. All PASO members would benefit from the harmonization of laws, \nregulations, and procedures; the availability of a range of supplemental TA; and continuous \naudits of national oversight needs. As countries take steps to improve their organizations and \ncapabilities, the Project would reinforce those efforts and continue to provide supplementary \nassistance. \n \n73.  PASO  has  recognized  the  need  for  capacity  building  as  a  long-term  objective. \nComponent A includes activities designed to increase the ability of national administrations to \nplan and manage improved safety and security systems. All the technical inspectors will be \nexpatriates in the near to medium term as no PDMC nationals are qualified, but this will \ngradually change. To become an inspector, a candidate must first be a qualified pilot. Although \na few PDMC nationals are trained to operate modern aircraft, as their number grows it will \nbecome possible to train them as inspectors. It is expected that this might be added to the \nPASO work program once the inspection system is well established, after about the fifth year of \nimplementation. \n \n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2001. Global Air Transport Crisis Impact Analysis. Manila. ", "14 \n74.  Since the Project is an innovative approach to common problems facing smaller PDMCs, \ndisseminating lessons learned from PASO should be an important activity for ADB to leverage \nits experience with regional cooperation, as recommended in the Pacific regional cooperation \nstrategy and program for 2004\u20132006.11 In the short term, this will begin with consideration of \nexpanding the cooperative model under the Pacific Regional Transport Analysis.12 PASO has \ninvited ICAO to be represented on its Council of Directors, creating a regular link to official \ngovernment contacts in Pacific countries that are not PASO members.  \n \nF.  Project Risks \n75.  The Project has technical, financial, and institutional risks. The first technical risk is that \nICAO SARPs could grow more complex and increase the need for additional technical staff and \nprocedures that would overburden PASO and the small PDMC administrations and airlines. \nInternational  requirements  have  recently  been  comprehensively  revised,  however,  so  the \nlikelihood of substantial additional risk is low in the short to medium term. A second technical \nrisk is that airline fleets may change, requiring either retraining of technical staff, which would \nincrease costs to PASO in the short term, or reductions in staff due to reduced demand for \nservices. This risk is moderate and will require flexibility in PASO staffing and structure to \nenable adjustments. A third technical risk is whether operators have sufficient resources to \nimplement remedial actions. Although implementation will present challenges, improvements \nare mandatory with or without the Project. A significant advantage of PASO is that its PDMCs \nwill receive dedicated professional advice and administrative backup for improvements. \n \n76.  The financial strength of PDMC airlines poses a risk to their ability to pay service fees for \nadequate regulation and oversight. However, all airlines are required to enhance their safety \nand security  measures, so costs to airlines would go up with or without the Project. The \nperception of high costs should be placed in perspective; annual PASO service fees per country \nare equivalent to the cost of a few weeks of fuel for one modern jet. As the least-cost solution to \nthis  problem,  PASO  minimizes  the  risk.  If  government-owned  airlines  do  face  payment \ndifficulties, government counterpart contributions may have to be increased. However, these \ncontributions are very low so this related risk would have a low impact. In the extreme case of \npayment default, PASO would be able to adjust its staffing and operational schedules to reduce \ncosts until the problem was resolved.  \n \n77.  The institutional risks arise from the need for governments, airlines, and international \nagencies to cooperate in reforming and harmonizing the regulatory and legislative environment. \nICAO has already recognized PASO as a legitimate international organization and will exercise \nquality control through regular USOAP audits in each country. Governments will need to ensure \ncooperation between aviation ministries and ministries that draft and enact legislation. Since this \nactivity will be the responsibility of each national administration, with TA support, the risk of \nincomplete implementation is moderate. However the benefits of harmonization are clear to \nairlines, which may be expected to advocate completion. \n \n78.  Since the Project is intended to maintain the viability of an existing regional aviation \nindustry, and will not affect travel demand, it will have no environmental impacts. \n \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2003.

As ICAO members and signatories to the Chicago Convention, the PASO PDMCs are \nobligated to ensure aviation safety and security. These countries have three ways to meet their \nobligations: through PASO, contracting for services, or expanding national administrations. The \nidentified risks would apply equally to PASO and to the alternatives. However, PASO is the \nleast-cost solution, offers additional quality of service benefits, and can become financially self-\nsufficient to ensure the continuing availability of its services. It is the best solution because of its \ncost-effectiveness and ability to make qualitative improvements. \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n80.  In addition to the standard assurances, PASO and the Guarantors, as applicable, have \ngiven the following assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  Before  the  end  of  2006,  PASO  will  have  (a)  established  and  commenced \nimplementation of the ICAO SARPs for airline certification system and audits; (b) \ndesigned the regional surveillance program; (c) commenced field inspections; \nand (d) developed and commenced the training program for the national CAAs, \nairlines, and airport operators on new safety and security systems and related \ninspection, surveillance, and certification programs. \n \n(ii)  Before the end of 2006, with respect to the regional surveillance and inspection \nsystem, PASO will have (a) designed and implemented an MRAI plan for Kiribati, \nPapua  New  Guinea,  Samoa,  Solomon  Islands,  and  Vanuatu;  (b)  developed \ntechnical  guidance  material  in  each  specialized  discipline;  (c)  created  an \ninspection documentation and issue resolution system; and (d) established a \ncomprehensive record-keeping system and an electronic database system for \nrecording,  archiving,  and  reporting  inspection,  surveillance,  and  certification \nactivities in a manner that is transparent, and made the systems available to all \nPASO members.  \n \n(iii)  PASO shall ensure that the PASO members will provide, in a timely manner, all \nnecessary  counterpart  funds  and  in-kind  contributions  for  successful  project \nimplementation. \n \n(iv)  Within 6 months from loan effectiveness, PASO will establish a PPMS to monitor \nand evaluate implementation and development impact at various project stages. \nPPMS indicators will include national legislative and regulatory improvements, \ntechnical  certifications,  inspection  schedules,  organizational  financial \nperformance, and compliance with ICAO SARPs.  \n \n(v)  For each of its fiscal years, PASO will maintain (a) a debt service ratio of net \nearnings  to  estimated  debt  service  requirements  greater  than  6,  and  (b)  a \nliquidity ratio of accounts receivable to revenues not greater than 25%. \n \n(vi)  Beginning in year 6 of the operations, following completion of the Project, PASO \nwill maintain (a) an operating ratio of operating expenses to operating revenue \nnot higher than 100%, and (b) earnings at least 1.5 times interest payments. ", "16 \n \n(vii)  PASO  will  recruit  management  and  senior  technical  staff  on  the  basis  of \nminimum 3-year contracts to ensure continuity in administration and operations. \n \n(viii)  PASO and ADB will conduct a midterm review of the Project about 30 months \nafter loan effectiveness. \n \nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness \n81.  As conditions for loan effectiveness: \n \n(i)  Each of the PICASST and the PASO Constitution shall be in form and substance \nsatisfactory to ADB. \n \n(ii)  PASO  shall  have  been  registered  as  an  international  organization  under \nSchedule 6 of the Diplomatic Privileges and Immunities Act of Vanuatu [CAP] \n143. \n \n(iii)  Each of the Guarantors shall have signed or acceded to the PICASST. \n \n(iv)  Each of the Guarantee Agreements shall be in full force and effect. \n \n(v)  Fiji, Kiribati, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Vanuatu and Solomon Islands shall \nhave  entered  into  service  agreements  with  PASO,  governing  the  financial \nobligations  of  those  receiving  PASO  services,  each  in  form  and  substance \nsatisfactory to ADB. \n \nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n82.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various \ncurrencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 1,033,000 to the Pacific Aviation Safety Office, \nto be guaranteed on a several basis by the Republic of Kiribati, Papua New Guinea, the \nIndependent State of Samoa, and the Republic of Vanuatu, for the Establishment of the Pacific \nAviation Safety Office Project from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at \nthe rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of \n32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan and Guarantee Agreements \npresented to the Board. \n \n \nHARUHIKO KURODA \n                    President \n \n26 August 2005 ", "  Appendix 1  17 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions and Risks \nSummary  Indicators/Targets  Mechanisms \nImpact       \nThe Pacific aviation  (cid:131)  Full compliance with  (cid:131)  ICAO summary audit \nsector meets all  all relevant ICAO  reports \ninternational  safety and security   \nrequirements for safety  SARPs by all PASO \nand security regulation  PDMCs by 2009 \nand oversight   \n \nOutcome       \nImplement an effective  (cid:131)  Establishment of  (cid:131)  PASO Council of  (cid:131)  PASO is officially and \nand sustainable  PASO as an  Directors records  internationally recognized \napproach to  operational agency by    as an approved \nimprovement of aviation  2005    regulatory and oversight \nsafety and security,    (cid:131)  PASO work plan   organization \nbased on regional  (cid:131)  Appointment of a     \ncooperation, shared  general manager by    (cid:131)  PASO is able to recruit \ncapacity, and  the second quarter of  (cid:131)  PASO audited  internationally qualified \neconomies of scale  2005   accounts  technical specialists \n       \n(cid:131)  Appointment of four    (cid:131)  ICAO SARPs do not grow \ninternationally  (cid:131)  ADB disbursement  too complex and \nqualified technical  records  infeasible for small \nspecialists (one each    airlines and economies \nin airworthiness, flight   \noperations, security,  (cid:131)  Airline financial positions \nand aerodromes) by  do not deteriorate or \nthe third quarter of  increase the inability to \n2005  make timely payments for \n  oversight \n(cid:131)  Commencement of   \ninspections in each  (cid:131)  Airline fleets do not \ntechnical discipline by  evolve too quickly for \nthe end of 2005  PASO to adjust and \n  provide the necessary \n(cid:131)  Recovery of costs for  oversight services \ninspections by 2006   \n \n(cid:131)  Achievement of \nfinancial self-\nsufficiency by 2010 \n \nOutputs       \n1.

Introduction and Scope \n \n1.  This analysis summarizes the level of aviation activity in the Pacific developing member \ncountries (PDMCs) of the Pacific Aviation Safety Office (PASO), the status of national oversight \ncapacity, personnel, and implications for required activities. The need for the Project to build \nregional capacity is presented. A related institutional analysis that describes the optimal level of \noversight and national legislative and regulatory frameworks is in Appendix 4. \n \nB.  Current Level of Aviation Activity \n \n2.  The extent of aviation activity varies substantially among PDMCs, from the extensive \naviation industries of the two larger countries, to the much smaller ones of all the others. Table \nA3.1 provides indicators of the aircraft fleet and licensed personnel in the PASO PDMCs.  \n \nTable A3.1: National Aviation Industry Indicators \n \nFiji  Solomon     \n  Islands  Kiribati  PNG Samoa  Islands  Vanuatu Total\nAircraft Registered  34  3  204 5  4  14 266\nAircraft \u2013 jets  6  0  10 1  0  1 18\nAircraft \u2013 not jets, greater \nthan 10 seats  8  3  39 2  3  5 72\nActive Pilots Licenses  364  11  1,723 35  8  33 2,189\nFlight Crew Licenses \u2013 not \npilot licenses  54  3  2 0  0  0 59\nOther Active Licenses \u2013 not \nflight crew  177  6  1,437 11  11  14 1,661\nCommercial Air Transport \nOperators  7  1  29 2  1  2 43\nAir Operator Certificates \nIssued  7  1  39 2  \u2014  2 53\nValid Certificates of \nAirworthiness  34  3  204 5  \u2014  10 266\nApproved Maintenance \nOrganizations  7  1  35 1  \u2014  1 46\nNon-approved Maintenance \nOrganizations  0  1  0 0  \u2014  1 3\nOperations Inspectors  4  0  7 0  0  0 11\nAirworthiness Inspectors  4  0  5 0  0  1 10\n\u201c\u2014 \u201c = reliable data not available, PNG = Papua New Guinea. \nSources:  ADB.  2004.

Although  the  Pacific  aviation  industry  is  substantial  as  a  whole,  it  is  fragmented \nnationally. Papua New Guinea alone accounts for three quarters of the overall fleet, and more \nthan half of the jets. Four of the six PASO PDMCs operate modern jet equipment, even if the \nfleets are small. As a result, national capacity for safety and security regulation and oversight is \ndifficult to sustain due to diseconomies of scale. \n \n4.  Five of these six countries have no operation inspectors and four have no airworthiness \ninspectors, while no country has aerodromes or security inspectors. Where no local capacity \nexists, these required functions are contracted to the civil aviation authorities (CAAs) of more \ndeveloped countries outside the region, mainly Australia, New Zealand, and United Kingdom. A \nsummary of the safety oversight competency of each PASO member is in Table A3.2. \n \n5.  Only Fiji Islands and Papua New Guinea have independent regulatory agencies, while \nthe  other  countries  combine  policy,  regulatory,  and  operational  functions  within  aviation \nministries.  In  addition,  all  international  airlines  are  government-owned,  creating  potential \nconflicts of interest.  \n \nTable A3.2: Summary of Safety and Security Oversight Competency \n \nFiji Islands \n  The CAA of the Fiji Islands oversees airport operators, air traffic control and air navigation service \nproviders, aircraft operators, and licensed personnel. The flight operations department has five staff \npositions; four are held by three expatriates and one national. The airworthiness department has three \nstaff positions, all filled by Fiji Island nationals. UKCAA provides one airworthiness advisor. \nKiribati \n  The CAA does not have any direct oversight capability. Airworthiness oversight is handled by the \nUKCAA representative in the Fiji Islands, who comes to Kiribati as required. However, this service may be \nterminated soon and no alternative system has yet been developed. There has been no flight operation \noversight for about 7 years. The CAA has been headed by a series of expatriate directors of civil aviation \nfor several years. \nPapua New Guinea \n  The CAA\u2019s Safety Directorate has five subdivisions: airworthiness (eight positions, five filled, two \nby expatriates); flight operations (nine positions, seven filled by expatriates); personnel licensing (three \npositions, one filled by an expatriate); standards (newly created, not yet staffed); and infrastructure (newly \ncreated, not yet staffed). AusAID provides technical assistance to train inspectors.  \nSamoa \n  The ministry does not have any capability in flight operations and airworthiness oversight, and \ncontracts most of its responsibilities to the New Zealand CAA. \nSolomon Islands \n  The  CAA  has  no  oversight  capability.  All  oversight  should  be  handled  by  the  UKCAA \nrepresentative in the Fiji Islands, who should visit as needed; however, there have been no visits since \nlate 2000.  \nVanuatu \n  The CAA oversees airworthiness through one full-time expatriate officer, and flight operations \nthrough short-term contracting. Operational oversight for Air Vanuatu is provided by CASA in Australia, \nwhile licensing of private pilots is handled by a New Zealand-designated flight examiner. These licenses \nare issued by the state of examination (Australia and New Zealand) and these approvals are then used \nas the basis of issuing Vanuatu licenses. \nAusAID = Australian Agency for International Development, CAA = civil aviation authority, CASA = Civil \nAviation Safety Authority (Australia), UKCAA = United Kingdom civil aviation authority.  \nSources:  ADB.  2004.

The PASO PDMCs must move beyond the current patchwork oversight system and build \na fully capable and independent oversight system responsive to national and regional needs. \nThey  must  avoid  the  pitfalls  of  outsourcing  all  oversight  services  and  responsibilities\u2014\noverlooked requirements, delays in service, and lack of priority\u2014which they have experienced. \nA regional oversight capacity must provide reliable and responsive oversight services to the \nmembers  and  their  air  transport operators  on  demand.  Service  quality  must  be  improved, \nbecome more responsive to national needs, and provide a greater margin of safety.  \n \n7.  Most  PASO  PDMCs  wish  to  reduce  safety  oversight  costs  although  they  have  not \nfunded  and  staffed  their  respective  CAAs  to  meet  minimum  International  Civil  Aviation \nOrganization (ICAO) standards. The cost of achieving compliance will be higher than current \nexpenditures whether the services are provided by PASO or other agencies. \n \n1.  Surveillance and Inspection Programs  \n8.  Inspection  and  surveillance  programs  need  to  create  capacity  in  flight  operations, \nairworthiness, aerodromes, and security. The scale of the regional industry means that flight \noperations and airworthiness each require one full-time inspector. These staff members should \nalso be able to perform aerodrome oversight. Security oversight requires a dedicated inspector \nwith a very high level of knowledge, experience, and expertise because of security concerns \nand demands worldwide. One well-qualified security inspector could provide adequate security \noversight services to the region.  \n \n9.  All technical staff must be highly skilled and experienced regulators, not former airline \npersonnel with operations and airworthiness experience. Technical staff inspectors should have \nexperience in  policy  and  as  line  inspectors. A  regional organization  will  require  a  general \nmanager with regulatory and policy experience, and equally solid skills as a technical inspector.  \n \n10.  Because  the  Pacific  region  needs  full-time  permanent  capability,  staff  from  better-\ndeveloped organizations will not be seconded. Organizations such as the US Federal Aviation \nAdministration,  ICAO,  and  the  European  Joint  Aviation  Administration  occasionally  provide \nexpertise but normally for short-term assignments. A negative aspect of secondment is that the \ntechnical experts are not typically from the Pacific region and have to spend an inordinate \namount of time learning the regulatory system.  \n \n2.  Airline Recertification  \n11.  Safety certification of an airline is an obligation of the state and an ICAO requirement, \nand must be completed before flight operations. However, the airlines operating in the PASO \nPDMCs are effectively self-regulating, as they have been operating for many years with little \nsurveillance or inspection from any regulatory authority. With few exceptions, many airlines \nhave never had a competent ICAO-compliant safety certification as required by ICAO standards \nand  recommended  practices  (SARPs).  In  addition  to  establishing  a  standardized  safety \noversight system and surveillance program for the region, these countries also need to recertify \nor revalidate the air operator certificates (AOCs) of their airlines.  \n \n12.  The airline certification and surveillance and inspection programs required by ICAO are \nrelated but very different in their purpose and effect. The certification of an airline before \ninternational operations establishes the fitness of the operator and serves as the baseline for \ncontinuing surveillance  and  inspection  by  the  regulatory  authority.  The  AOC  is  the  state\u2019s ", "24  Appendix 3 \nguarantee to other nations that its airline is fit to operate internationally and meets all ICAO \nrequirements. The continuing surveillance, inspection, and audit of the operator by the state \nguarantee  to  other  nations  that  the  airline  continues  to  meet  the  original  certification \nrequirements  for  the issuance  of an  AOC.  Both  programs  are  necessary  and  need  to  be \naccomplished in all the PASO PDMCs as soon as possible. \n \n13.  An air operator recertification effort of this magnitude will require a higher level of staffing \nthan will an ongoing surveillance and inspection program. A regional technical staff member \nwould be fully occupied in designing and implementing a regulatory system and initiating an \ninspection and surveillance program. A separate team could recertify all air operators holding an \nAOC from any of the PASO PDMCs. Most airline recertification work should be outsourced on a \nshort-term basis to avoid overstaffing. \n \nD.  Potential Regional Capacity \n \n14.  The technical level of effort necessary to return each of the PASO PDMCs to minimum \nICAO  standards  is  much  higher  than  feasible  now,  whether  these  are  provided  through \ndomestic organizations or through external contracting, as most of these countries have neither \nsufficient personnel to do the job internally nor sufficient resources to plan and manage external \nexpertise. \n \n15.  All of the PASO PDMCs have the capability to implement administrative procedures \nrecommended by a competent safety oversight organization. Changes to national civil aviation \nlaws will by necessity be processed by the independent members. However, with the exception \nof the Fiji Islands and Papua New Guinea, none of the PASO PDMCs have the resident \ncapability to design and implement the necessary technical systems. Regional capacity is thus \nrequired to produce and implement the regulations and guidance material through inspections \nand audits.  \n \n16.  PASO is intended to provide advisory, certification, inspection, and surveillance services \nto the national CAAs and aviation industries of its members by identifying deficiencies, setting \nout remedial steps, and monitoring implementation through to full compliance. PASO must take \na systems approach to develop and implement an oversight regime to include the development \nof surveillance and inspection programs. \n \n17.  The aviation environments of the PASO PDMCs vary in complexity and in the degree of \ndevelopment  of  safety  oversight  capabilities.  Generally,  the  more  complex  the  commercial \naviation environment, the more sophisticated the flight safety organization. The merit of the \nProject stems from its multifaceted role. All members will benefit from the activities undertaken \nby the Project to improve and harmonize laws, regulations, and procedures; a wide range of \nsupplemental  technical  assistance;  and  continuous  audits  of  national  oversight  needs.  As \ncountries take steps to improve their organizations and capabilities, the Project will reinforce \nthose efforts and continue to provide supplementary assistance after improvements are made. \n \n18.  PASO is governed by a Council of Directors, which represents member governments \nand includes advisers from the aviation industry, multilateral agencies, and established safety \noversight authorities. Its mandate, which is founded in the Pacific Islands Civil Aviation Safety \nand Security Treaty, is to provide guidance, strategy, and policy, and to resolve problems.  \n \n19.  PASO cannot replace CAAs\u2019 authority or responsibility for aviation safety oversight. \nAlthough members will rely on PASO advice and recommendations to resolve safety issues and ", "  Appendix 3  25 \nto maintain compliance with ICAO SARPs, they remain responsible for implementing PASO \nadvice and recommendations.  \n \n20.  The  PASO  Council  of  Directors  must  proactively  communicate  the  need  for,  and \npromote, a complete and thorough revamping of the PASO PDMCs\u2019 safety oversight means and \nmethods. What must be clear and unambiguous to the PASO members is the need for a safety \noversight system, not the ad hoc and often piecemeal approach in evidence.  \n \n21.  PASO has been recognized by ICAO headquarters in Montreal, Canada, as a legitimate \ninternational organization. The United States Federal Aviation Administration and the European \nJoint  Aviation  Administration  have  expressed  their  support  for  regional  safety  oversight  in \ngeneral and for PASO in particular in recent international meetings. International institutional \nsupport for PASO will be instrumental in achieving the credibility to provide regional oversight \nservices. \n \n22.  Based on the analysis of safety oversight and regulation requirements, in comparison \nwith  national  capacities,  an  independent  regional  organization  such  as  PASO  is  clearly \nnecessary and feasible. PASO can provide core technical regulatory services and expertise \nallowing  its  PDMCs  to  meet  their  safety  oversight  obligations  and  improve  their  oversight \ncapabilities through technical and institutional cooperation.  \n \n ", "26  Appendix 4 \nINSTITUTIONAL ANALYSIS \n \n \nA.  Required and Current Status of Oversight \n \n1.  The international standards of competence and compliance applied to a safety oversight \nsystem are based on the Convention on International Civil Aviation (the Chicago Convention), \nwhich assigns responsibility to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to organize \nand  publish  standards  and  recommended  practices  (SARPs)  in  the  form  of  annexes  and \nsupporting documentation. ICAO has developed and maintains 18 annexes covering all aspects \nof civil aviation safety oversight, supported by related publications.  \n \n2.  The uniform application of ICAO SARPs by ICAO members is necessary for safe and \nefficient  international  air  operations.  All  ICAO  members,  as  signatories  to  the  Chicago \nConvention, are obligated to secure the highest practical degree of uniformity in regulations, \nstandards,  and  procedures;  ensure  their  effective  implementation;  and  notify  ICAO  of  any \ndifferences between their national regulations or practices and ICAO SARPs. From a safety \noversight perspective, an ICAO member\u2019s responsibilities under the Convention include:  \n \n(i)  airports and navigation aids; \n(ii)  aviation security;  \n(iii)  certification of aircraft, air operators, and maintenance organizations;  \n(iv)  registration of its aircraft for the purpose of ensuring airworthiness; \n(v)  issuance  of  an  air  operator  certificate  (AOC)  to  control  and  supervise  the \noperationally related activities of each aircraft operator in the state;  \n(vi)  licensing, control, and supervision of personnel, certified products, and approved \norganizations;  \n(vii)  ensuring  adequacy  of  the  air  operator\u2019s  ability  to  provide  safe  and  efficient \noperations prior to the initiation of international flight operations; \n(viii)  ensuring that the operator can conduct operations with respect to the original \ncertification criteria on a continuing basis; and \n(ix)  taking timely and necessary actions to resolve safety issues relating to meeting \nthe national civil aviation law and regulations. \n \n3.  ICAO  defines  eight  critical  elements  of  a  safety  oversight  system  that  must  be \nconsidered by every country: \n \n(i)  primary  aviation  law:  consistent  with  the  environment  and  complexity  of  the \naviation industry; \n(ii)  specific operating regulations: adequate to address at least the convention and \nannex standards; \n(iii)  CAA structure and safety oversight functions: adequate resources and technical \nsupervisory and support personnel;  \n(iv)  technical guidance:  sufficient for technical and support personnel to perform \ntheir functions in a standardized manner; \n(v)  qualified  technical  personnel  to  inspect  the  aviation  activities  to  the  level  of \ncomplexity required; \n(vi)  licensing  and  certification  obligations:  processes  that  the  aviation  community \nmust complete before initiating the tasks and operations associated with the level \nof certificate issued; ", "  Appendix 4  27 \n(vii)  continued surveillance obligations: processes to ensure that the aviation industry \nfunctions at minimum levels of competency and safety; and \n(viii)  resolution  of  safety  issues:  processes  and  methodologies  to  resolve  safety \nissues, including the ability to penalize individuals or operators and to suspend or \nrevoke their authority. \n \n4.  These elements of a safety oversight system are required to ensure that the country\u2019s \nregulatory system is appropriate to the complexity of its aviation industry. However, all the \nPASO PDMCs, with the exception of the Fiji Islands and to a lesser degree Papua New Guinea, \nare unable to fully meet all of their safety oversight obligations under the Chicago Convention in \naccordance with ICAO SARPs.  \n \n5.  As a result, all but one PASO PDMC has received unsatisfactory results from the ICAO-\nmandated universal safety oversight audit program (USOAP) during initial and follow-up audits. \nCommon deficiencies in the eight critical elements include the following: \n \n(i)  Primary aviation legislation in most countries is seriously noncompliant with ICAO \nSARPs. Common deficiencies include the lack of provision to establish a CAA, a \nlack of authority to promulgate aviation regulations, and lack of process to update \nthe civil aviation law to meet ICAO requirements. \n(ii)  Specific  operating  regulations  across  the  region  generally  need  substantial \nimprovement. Even members that have adopted regulations from a competent \nsource have not fully developed them. Typically, there are neither systems of \norders, directives, and instructions to establish policies and procedures for a \nnational safety oversight system, nor systems to create new or amend existing \nregulations. As a result, most regulations do not address all ICAO SARPs. \n(iii)  CAA  safety  oversight  functions  and  continuing  surveillance  obligations  are \nhindered, and most of the region's CAAs are unable to fulfill their safety oversight \nresponsibilities because they lack adequate government budgetary support. This \ncontributes directly to poor facilities and an inability to recruit and retain technical \nstaff. Several CAAs are headed by staff members with no formal training in \naviation, a problem compounded by a lack of technical training programs.  \n(iv)  Technical guidance systems and materials are underdeveloped and incomplete. \nSeveral countries have no inspector handbooks, policies, orders, or directives, \nand some CAAs have not established a flight operation inspectorate system \nsupported by regulations and procedures so that its own technical personnel can \nsupervise air transport operations.  \n(v)  Qualified technical personnel are in short supply, many of the technical staff \npositions are vacant, and few CAA personnel assigned to flight operations are \npilots.  The  aggregate  personnel  numbers  (Table  A3.1)  do  not  account  for \nexpertise. Expatriate technical personnel are generally more highly qualified than \nnationals but are in the minority. Consequently, little oversight is undertaken by \nmost CAAs, and airlines are effectively self-regulating. \n(vi)  Licensing and certification obligations need improvement. Some countries have \nno regulatory requirements or procedures to issue an air operator\u2019s certificate \n(AOC)  and  related  operations  specifications.  These  functions  are  typically \noutsourced ad hoc.  \n \n6.  Similar results are expected with the new requirements for security audits, which entered \ninto  force  in  January  2005,  under  the  ICAO-mandated  Universal  Security  Oversight  Audit \nProgram. ", "28  Appendix 4 \n \nD.  National Legislative and Regulatory Frameworks \n \n7.  National legislation is often outdated and inadequate for a modern regulatory system, \nand related operating regulations across the region generally need substantial improvement. A \nsummary of the status of national frameworks is in Table A4. \n \nTable A4: Summary of National Legislative and Regulatory Capabilities \n \nFiji Islands \n  The civil aviation law, with minor exceptions, appears to meet ICAO requirements. With minor \nexceptions, the CAA seems fully capable of exercising its international obligations. \nKiribati \n  The civil aviation law, enacted in 1949 and not amended since colonial times, is grossly outdated. \nThe country has no safety oversight capability. \nPapua New Guinea \n  The civil aviation law, with minor exceptions, appears to meet ICAO requirements. Regulations \nare in transition, but the support contract to revise the regulations has been suspended due to funding \nconstraints. Air New Guinea conducts ETOPS operations but has no qualified operations inspector for \ncompetent inspection or surveillance of these operations.  \nSamoa \n  The CAA has some in-house safety oversight capability but contracts with the New Zealand CAA \nfor most of its technical oversight obligations and could not stand alone from a technical oversight \nperspective. \nSolomon Islands \n  The civil aviation law is outdated as it has not been revised in almost a decade, has not been \namended  to  incorporate  industry  practices  or  ICAO  SARPs.  The  country  has  no  safety  oversight \ncapability. \nVanuatu \n  The civil aviation law does not meet many ICAO requirements and needs revision and updating. \nThe CAA claims to be using the New Zealand regulations but the law does not reflect their adoption. The \nCAA has one airworthiness inspector and contracts an operations inspector for a period of 2 weeks per \nyear, but this is inadequate for national operations.  \nCAA= civil aviation authority, ICAO = International Civil Aviation Organization, ETOPS = extended range \ntwin engine operations, SARPs = standards and recommended practices. \nSources:  ADB.  2004.

In all cases, an attorney with international civil aviation experience should thoroughly \nreview each country's civil aviation law. The character and nature of the international civil \naviation industry has changed markedly in recent years, and many important ICAO oversight \nrequirements and SARPs have evolved significantly but have not been reflected in national laws \nand regulations.  \n \n9.  Standardization of the regulatory environment will significantly improve the ability of \nPASO  to  develop,  implement,  and  maintain  compliance  with  regulatory  systems  and \ninternational standards.

Most  Pacific  Aviation  Safety  Office  (PASO)  Pacific  developing  member  countries \n(PDMCs) are unable to meet their audit and oversight responsibilities given their resources, \nwhich must be improved to reach minimum ICAO standards. Starting from existing costs of \noversight  (which  are  known  to  provide  inadequate  services),  the  economic  and  financial \nanalyses compare the costs of audit and oversight functions if they were to be upgraded to an \nacceptable level through expansion of existing arrangements versus expected costs to obtain \nacceptable oversight provided through PASO.  \n \nA.  Current Costs of Oversight  \n \n2.  A summary of the available data on overall costs of airworthiness and flight operations \noversight in PASO PDMCs is in Table A8.1. Countries with existing staff provided data only on \ndirectly  attributable  costs  (primarily  personnel).  Those  countries  that  rely  on  contracted \nassistance provided data that includes travel and overhead.  \n \nTable A8.1: Summary of Current Annual Costs of Existing Oversight  \n($\u2019000) \n \nFiji  Solomon     \n  Islandsa Kiribatib PNGc Samoad Islandse Vanuatuf Totalg\nAirworthiness (AW)  318  9  255 \u2014  0  100  682 \nFlight Operations (FO)  170  0  542 \u2014  0  13  725 \nCombined (AW + FO)  \u2014   \u2014   \u2014 25  \u2014  \u2014  25 \nPersonnel Licensing  \u2014   \u2014  95 \u2014   \u2014  \u2014  95 \n  Total   488  9  892 25  0  113  1,527 \n\u201c\u2014 \u201c = not applicable, PNG = Papua New Guinea. \na Based on existing staff, with estimated compensation of $35,000 per year for national airworthiness inspectors, and \n$35,000 to $70,000 for expatriate flight operations inspectors. \nb Based on contracted assistance, though no flight operations oversight is provided.

For other countries, cost estimates generally are for personnel only. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates from aviation authority and airline data. \n \n3.  Although Table A8.1 provides a baseline estimate of expenditures in PASO PDMCs, \nunavailable or inconsistent data means that the with- and without-project scenarios cannot be \neasily compared because the baseline (i) includes expenditures in the Fiji Islands that will not \nchange because the country is self-sufficient; (ii) includes substantial expenditures in Papua \nNew Guinea related to a large number of light aircraft, which will not change because the \ncountry  intends  to  retain  oversight  capacity  for  the  fleet;  (iii)  omits  sizable  expenditure \nrequirements on personnel licensing and oversight of aerodromes and security, which are not \naccounted for by any PDMC; and (iv) omits overheads for most countries. These estimates are, \ntherefore, the lower bounds of expenditure for inadequate oversight and regulation in all cases \nexcept the Fiji Islands and Papua New Guinea.  \n ", "  Appendix 8  33 \nB.  Projected Cost of Required Oversight Under Existing Arrangements \n \n4.  With the exception of the Fiji Islands, oversight is inadequate in all other PASO PDMCs, \nas they do not fully meet all required ICAO SARPs through institutionalized safety systems \napproaches. Airline recertification, creation of technical guidance material, establishment of a \ndatabase to resolve safety issues, and legal assistance are all required to return the PDMCs to \na  minimum  acceptable  baseline.  Providing  acceptable  oversight  by  expanding  existing \narrangements would mean that countries would forego cost savings to their airlines inherent in a \nharmonized operating environment, as well as some of the advantages of joint administrative \nsupport. \n \n5.  Annual costs of required oversight are based on a minimum required annual inspection \n(MRAI) program that would increase oversight to adequate levels through additional inspections \nin all disciplines, and provide administrative backup to the individual CAAs that is not currently \navailable through existing contract arrangements. Since the Fiji Islands intends to remain self-\nsufficient, it does not require significant additional services under any future scenario and has, \ntherefore, been removed from the comparison.1 A summary of annual costs using expanded \ncontracts under existing arrangements is in Table A8.2 below.2\n \nTable A8.2: Summary of Projected Annual Costs of Required Oversight  \nUnder Expansion of Existing Arrangements  \n($\u2019000) \n \nSolomon     \nActivitya Kiribatib PNGc Samoad Islandse Vanuatuf Totalg\nAirworthiness   56  58  49  43  78  285 \nFlight Operations   71  77  62  54  97  362 \nSecurity  32  32  32  32  32  160 \nAerodromes  22  22  22  22  22  108 \n  Total   181  189  166  151  228  915 \nPNG = Papua New Guinea. \na Includes validation of personnel licensing in each discipline. \nb Based on current United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority (UKCAA) contract rates. \nc Based on existing Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) national and expatriate staff costs. \nd Based on current CAA of New Zealand contract rates. \ne Based on current UKCAA contract rates. \nf Based on existing CAA expatriate staff costs and contracted assistance from the Civil Aviation Safety \nAuthority of Australia. \ng Costs include travel, per diem, and overhead for contracted services. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates from aviation authority and airline data. \n \nC.  Projected Cost of Required Oversight Under PASO \n \n6.  Projected costs to provide oversight through PASO comprise four elements: personnel \ncosts, travel, overheads, and office accommodation. PASO professional staff will include a \ngeneral  manager  (also  qualified  in  a  technical  discipline)  and  one  inspector  each  for \nairworthiness and avionics, flight operations, and security. Aerodrome inspection can be split \nbetween the security and flight operation inspectors, as well as some services from the general \nmanager, with cross-training. Professional staff costs have been estimated using international \n                                                 \n1 The Fiji Islands does expect to contract with PASO for occasional technical services, primarily on an as-needed \nbasis when its capacity experiences temporary shortfalls, so it remains a member of the organization. \n2 This summary is for the steady-state case expected in project year 5 onward. See section F below for details.

There are no costs for \ndomestic administrative staff as the Government of Vanuatu provides two people.  \n \n7.  Accommodation  costs  include  renovations  and  standard  office  and  communications \nequipment. There are no costs for rent as the Government of Vanuatu provides office space as \nin-kind support. Travel costs are significantly lower than those under scenarios that rely on \nexpanding existing contracting arrangements since the greatest demand for inspections is in \nVanuatu.  \n \n8.  Total costs, which are detailed by project component in Appendix 6, have been allocated \nby activity and country according to the estimated MRAI schedule. These costs will be used to \nset service fees on a full cost-recovery basis.

Economic Analysis \n \n9.  The economic evaluation was carried out for without- and with-project scenarios. Without \nthe Project, safety oversight would be provided by expanding existing contracting arrangements \n(section B). With the Project, safety oversight would be provided through PASO (section C). In \nboth scenarios, the annual net economic benefits are the difference between the financial costs \nof providing services, without any adjustment, since in all cases the inputs (technical assistance \nversus  expatriate  labor,  plus  travel)  are  traded  and  the  analysis  uses  border  prices  as \nnumeraire.

Comparison of Alternatives \n \n10.  Regionally, PASO provides the most cost-effective way to improve safety and security \nregulation and oversight in its PDMCs. Nationally, PASO offers the same cost-effectiveness in \nall its members requiring services, except for Papua New Guinea, which has national and \nexpatriate inspectors. In aggregate, these costs savings are equivalent to 14% per year, with a \nnet present value of approximately $573,000 and an economic internal rate of return of 30% \nover the 20-year planning period.  \n \n11.  Besides providing the minimum required oversight, PASO is expected to offer services \nthat are qualitatively better than ad hoc contracting, since it will be a regionally controlled \ninternational  organization  dedicated  to  the  needs  of  its  members.  PASO  will  result  in \nharmonization that reduces compliance costs of airlines, and standardized record keeping that \nimproves  international  compliance  of  governments.  PASO  will  provide  national  CAAs  with \nadministrative backup that is not available through current contracting arrangements. These \nqualitative  advantages  are  not  captured  in  the  financial  and  economic  estimates,  so  the \nanalytical results should be understood as a lower bound on the total benefits of the Project. \n ", "36  Appendix 8 \nF.  Financing Plan  \n \n12.  PASO will generate revenues though service fees paid by the aviation industry, as is the \ncurrent practice. Since only four PASO members will become guarantors, while the others will \nbe charged a premium of 10% above basic cost-recovery level in lieu of a capital contribution. \nThis premium will also apply to nonmembers that contract PASO services. \n \n13.  Solomon Islands\u2019 needs for safety oversight are in transition so the country will not draw \non the full range of PASO services for the first several years. Since it will not require oversight of \ninternational airline operations for the next few years, but will require oversight of security and \naerodromes, estimated PASO revenues have been reduced by 25% for the first 5 years. This \nsituation is expected to be resolved well within the 5-year project period. \n \n14.  The time lag between the start of operations and revenue generation, the need to \nfinance inception activities, and the temporarily reduced participation of Solomon Islands mean \nthat upfront finance is required to achieve eventual self-sufficiency. Under these conditions, a \nloan  of  $1.5  million  will  be  adequate  to  finance  the  startup  costs  and  transition  to  self-\nsufficiency. The balance of the financial requirements will be met through revenues generated \nfrom services provided to airlines and airport operators in PASO PDMCs.

Justification \n \n1.  A harmonized operating environment will produce benefits broader than those accruing \nto Pacific Aviation Safety Office (PASO) members only, particularly for travelers and airlines of \nmajor countries serving the Pacific region. Because of the positive externalities involved, it is \nappropriate  to  supplement  project  activities  through  external  technical  assistance  (TA).  In \nconjunction with the Project, TA is required to supplement the technical capacity of PASO staff \nfor one-time activities to support the inspections and systems design. \n \nB.  Scope of Work \n \n2.  The overall goal of consulting services is to establish a consistent safety and security \noversight  framework  for  all  PASO  members  to  enable  organizational  efficiency  and \neffectiveness. TA will be provided to PASO staff, the PASO Council of Directors, and national \ncivil aviation administrations to provide legal and regulatory advice, provide technical support for \nairlines recertification audits, and develop information systems.  \n \nC.  Estimated Costs and Financing \n \n3.  The  total  TA  amount  is  $550,000,  of  which  the  Cooperation  Fund  for  Regional \nTransportation and Financial Security Initiative (a multi-donor umbrella facility funded by the \ngovernments of Australia, Japan, and United States) will finance $450,000 on a grant basis to \nbe administered by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). PASO and its members will provide the \nremainder in kind.  \n \n4.  Twelve person-months of international and six person-months of domestic consulting \nservices will be required. The recruitment of a firm to provide all required services, using the \nquality- and cost-based selection process and simplified technical proposals, will be preferred. \nHowever, recruitment of individuals may be allowed for services in highly specialized technical \nareas  where  no  firm  proposes  providing  the  full  breadth  of  services  required.  Consulting \nservices will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, and \nother arrangements satisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic consultants.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n5.   The Executing Agency for the TA will be PASO, which will be responsible for project \nimplementation and coordination across national government agencies. The general manager of \nPASO will serve as the TA coordinator. The PASO Council of Directors will serve as the project \nsteering committee. \n \nE.  Terms of Reference for Consultants \n \n6.  An aviation legal specialist (international, 4 person-months) is required to establish the \nlegal and regulatory basis for harmonization in each PASO Pacific developing member country \n(PDMC).
