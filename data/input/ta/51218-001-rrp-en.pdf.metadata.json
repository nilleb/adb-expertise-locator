I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed senior \nunsecured loan of up to $100,000,000 to An Binh Commercial Joint Stock Bank (ABB) for the \nExpanding Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprise Lending Project in Viet Nam.1 \n2.  The proposed loan will support the growth of ABB\u2019s micro, small, and medium enterprises \n(MSMEs) financing portfolio, providing needed financial products and services to this underserved \nsegment. ABB\u2019s strategic focus has prioritized the development of its MSME financing business \nline, with a particular focus on women-led MSMEs. In addition, the proposed loan will contribute \nto enterprise development and broader economic growth in Viet Nam through job creation. The \nlonger-termed funding provided under the proposed loan will also assist ABB in balancing its \nasset-liability maturity profile better, in line with new State Bank of Viet Nam (SBV) regulations.  \nII.  THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n \n3.  Financial sector overview. Viet Nam\u2019s financial system is relatively large for a middle-\nincome country, with D8,504 trillion in total assets for credit institutions as of year-end 2016. \nHowever, the system remains bank-centric, comprising 35 commercial banks, 2 policy banks, 16 \nfinance companies, 11 leasing companies, 1 cooperative bank, people\u2019s credit funds, 3 licensed \nmicrofinance institutions, 8 wholly foreign-owned banks, 2 joint venture banks, and 51 foreign \nbank branches. In 2016, the banking sector\u2019s assets amounted to 194% of gross domestic product \n(GDP) and accounted for more than 95% of the financial sector\u2019s total assets. The four major \nstate-owned commercial banks\u2014Agribank, Bank for Investment and Development of Vietnam, \nVietcombank, and VietinBank\u2014continue to dominate the sector, accounting for 45% of banking \nsector assets in 2016 and providing half of total credit. \n \n4.  Viet Nam\u2019s banking sector has expanded quite rapidly, paralleling the country\u2019s overall \neconomic growth following liberalization, with average credit growth of 24% per year (2005\u20132015). \nDirected by policy lending, much of this credit growth went to Viet Nam\u2019s network of state-owned \nenterprises (SOEs) and their affiliates, laying the groundwork for the difficulties encountered by \nthe banking sector beginning with the 2008 global financial crisis and subsequent 2012 domestic \ncrisis, related to real estate market difficulties. While immediate efforts by the SBV to address \nthese crises were effective, longer term reform measures, such as the bank restructuring plan, \nare still in progress. In line with the SBV\u2019s strategic objective to strengthen the capital base of \ndomestic commercial banks, the implementation of Basel II standards is planned, with 10 banks \ncurrently piloting its adoption. In addition, the SBV has actively encouraged banking sector \nconsolidation through mergers, acquisitions, and takeovers as means to improve capitalization.  \n \n5.  SBV\u2019s efforts to tackle the sector\u2019s weak asset quality are also ongoing, with tighter loan \nclassification standards adopted in 2015 as part of the measures to maintain the sector\u2019s \nnonperforming loan (NPL) ratio below the prescribed 3.0%. This followed the establishment in \n2013 of the Vietnam Asset Management Company (VAMC), which buys NPLs from banks by \nexchanging the NPLs for a special class of zero-interest bonds. The banks gradually provision \nthese bonds, which typically have tenors of 5 years (and exceptionally 10 years), to reach 100% \n                                                \n1  Micro, small, and medium enterprises are defined as (i) micro enterprises or \u201csuper\u201d small enterprises with an annual \nrevenue of less than D25 billion, (ii) small enterprises with an annual revenue of D25 billion\u2013D50 billion, and (iii) \nmedium enterprises with an annual revenue of D50 billion\u2013D200 billion. \n ", "2 \n \ncoverage by maturity, at which point the NPLs (if still unresolved) are returned to the bank at zero \nbook value in exchange for the fully provisioned bond. As Viet Nam continues to work through its \nlegacy of impaired loans, estimated at 8.4% of total loans as of year-end 2016 (down from 12.7% \nas of 30 June 2015 and over 20.0% at the height of the crisis in 2012), some concerns with regard \nto systemic soundness remain.2 Overall capital adequacy for the sector is marginal at 12.8% as \nof year-end 2016 under Basel I standards, but would be expected to be lower under Basel II \nguidelines when fully implemented in 2020. It also remains to be seen whether banks will \nadequately provision for future NPLs after enduring the high provisioning levels associated with \nthe VAMC scheme that suppressed profitability as well as the return on assets (0.6% as of year-\nend 2016) and the return on equity (7.5% as of year-end 2016). \n \n6.  Micro, small, and medium enterprises sector overview. MSMEs account for the \nmajority of Viet Nam\u2019s total business population, amounting to over 590,000 active businesses.3 \nAccording to the White Book on Viet Nam\u2019s small and medium enterprises (SMEs) published by \nthe Ministry of Plans and Investment, 97.6% of enterprises in Viet Nam are SMEs by the labor \nscale (under 100 employees), accounting for an estimated 40% of GDP and over 50% of \nemployment.4 Despite their significant contribution to the economy, MSMEs encounter numerous \nobstacles that inhibit their overall development and economic potential. In addition to such \nconstraints as difficulty with land use rights, limited use of technological advancements that could \nenhance product development, and lagging efficiency and productivity, a key obstacle is access \nto finance. This is echoed by the Viet Nam Bank Association which reports that Viet Nam\u2019s \nMSMEs have faced considerable challenges in accessing credit. Recent research finds that only \n47% of male owners and 37% of women owners of MSMEs had received bank loans over the last \n2 years despite measures introduced by the government to support the development of MSMEs.5,6 \nThe lack of adequate funding to support the working capital and investment needs of MSMEs has \nconsiderable implications not  only for the incremental growth of these enterprises and job \ncreation, but also for broader economic growth. The lack of needed funding limits MSMEs\u2019 ability \nto increase their competitiveness and tie into value chains by plugging into domestic and \ninternational production networks.7  \n7.  Investment rationale. In line with the sovereign operations of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB), which supports government initiatives to develop financial markets and make them \nmore inclusive, ADB\u2019s nonsovereign operations has sought to partner with financial institutions \nthat  have  developed  inclusive  business  models  targeting  these  underbanked  segments  to \naddress issues related to access to finance and credit for underserved customer segments, such \nas MSMEs in Viet Nam. One such partner financial institution is ABB. Currently among the \n                                                \n2  International Monetary Fund. 2017.

To facilitate MSMEs\u2019 access \nto credit, the government has (i) established credit guarantee funds for MSMEs and promoted financial consulting \nand investment management; (ii) designed training programs for MSMEs to enhance their capacity to prepare \nprojects and business plans to meet credit institution requirements; and (iii) established MSME developmental fund \nfinancing by the state and other organizations within the country. \n7  Only 64.6% of MSMEs in Viet Nam participate in the global supply chain, compared with 82.4% of MSMEs in Malaysia \nand 91.1% in Thailand.

Business Overview and Strategy \n \n8.  Overview. Originally a rural institution operating as a cooperative in southern Viet Nam, \nABB has evolved into a diversified bank with a presence in the retail, MSME, and corporate client \nsegments. Benefitting from early investments made by SOEs (Electricity of Vietnam [EVN] and \nPetroVietnam Finance), as well as private investors, such as the Hanoi General Export Import \nCorporation (Geleximco), ABB experienced rapid growth as a corporate lender after its transition \nto a bank by tying into its shareholders\u2019 subsidiary, client, and supplier \u201cecosystems\u201d. Following \nits strategic partnership in 2008 with Maybank, Malaysia\u2019s largest bank, (with an initial 15% \nshareholding, which increased to 20% in 2009) and the IFC\u2019s subsequent investment (for a 10% \nstake in 2013), ABB refocused its strategic objectives to expand its consumer and MSME \nportfolios, while maintaining its market position in corporate lending. \n \n9.  Business strategy. Pursuant to the bank\u2019s restructuring program initiated in 2012 and its \nfurther refined business strategy for 2017\u20132020, ABB aims to become one of the country\u2019s leading \nSME banks in the medium term and one of the strongest bank brands in the country. A key part \nof its strategic drive is expanding its retail operations, consisting of consumer and MSME lending.  \n \n10.  Consumer lending. ABB has steadily built its consumer banking franchise over the past \nfew years to diversify its total loan portfolio away from corporate loans and make it a vehicle to \nattract customer deposits at a lower cost of funds. In addition to the standard mix of loan offerings \n(e.g., car loans, mortgages, and personal business loans), ABB has also sought to provide a \nrange of fee-based services to customers, such as payments (online and mobile) and cards, both \ndebit (Visa and YouPay) and credit (Visa). Key components of ABB\u2019s consumer strategy are \nleveraging technological and digital applications for consumer services and cross-selling products \nand services. \n \n11.  Micro, small, and medium enterprises financing. A central theme of ABB\u2019s overall retail \nstrategy is the development of its MSME financing business line, with a focus on servicing the \nneeds of women-led MSMEs, which are estimated to comprise approximately 21% of registered \nMSMEs and more than 49% of all (both registered and informal) MSMEs (footnote 5). As part of \nthe process of developing this business line, ABB, with guidance from Maybank and the IFC, has \nundertaken a holistic review of its structure, target market, distribution channels, products, and \noperations, including its policies and procedures and risk management systems, to prepare to \nscale up its MSME financing business. As with its consumer lending business, ABB is looking to \nenhance its digital finance-based product and service offerings to MSMEs. \n \n12.  Corporate lending. ABB seeks to retain its position in corporate lending through a two-\npronged approach of (i) cultivating strategic partnerships with corporate groups and providing \nthem with a platform of products and services, and (ii) providing financial products and services \nto middle-market corporates. Building off its existing relationship, ABB is developing its first \nstrategic partnership with former shareholder EVN, the state-owned power company. ABB is also \ntargeting middle-market corporates in a variety of sectors throughout the country, emphasizing \nthe tailoring of service programs. \n ", "4 \n \n \nC.  Ownership, Management, and Governance \n \n13.  Ownership. Although not listed, ABB\u2019s shares are held by more than 5,000 shareholders. \nThe largest single shareholder is Maybank, with a 20.0% participation, held since 2009. With an \nadditional 10.0% held by the IFC since 2013, ABB\u2019s foreign ownership of 30% is one of the highest \nin the local banking sector. Geleximco, a Vietnamese privately owned conglomerate with interests \nin cement, paper, construction, and power generation, held a 12.9% stake as of 30 June 2017. \nEVN held a 16.0% stake in the bank until the fourth quarter of 2015, when it sold approximately \nhalf of its shares under the government\u2019s restructuring plan for SOEs, which encouraged these \ncompanies to offload non-core assets. EVN\u2019s remaining shares were sold in the first half of 2016, \nwith all buyers acquiring stakes of less than 2.0%. No other beneficial owners controlled more \nthan 3.5% of the bank\u2019s shares. Domestic institutional and individual investors held the remaining \n57.0%. Integrity due diligence was conducted.8 No significant or potentially significant integrity \nrisks were found. No tax integrity due diligence was required to be conducted.9 \n \n14.  Corporate  governance.  The  board  of  directors  consists  of  seven  members:  one \nexecutive member (the chairman and chief executive officer, who has been in place since 2003), \nfour non-executive members representing the principal shareholders (two for Maybank, one for \nthe IFC, and one for Geleximco), and two independent members. All members possess relevant \nqualifications  with  significant  banking  sector  experience.  The  board  is  assisted  by  three \ncommittees,  which  oversee  risk  management,  human  resources,  and  strategy.  A  separate \nsupervisory board, which performs the functions of an audit committee, has three members, all \nwith finance, audit, and/or prior banking experience. \n \n15.  Management. ABB\u2019s management board has six members, all with sound professional \nand academic backgrounds and expertise in the banking sector. Following the departure of the \nformer chief executive officer in 2015, after 3 years in the position, Mr. Cu Anh Tuan assumed \noffice in May 2015. The former deputy general director of ABB with over 22 years of professional \nexperience, including a strong background in finance, Mr. Tuan was previously the finance \ndirector at Techcombank and the State Capital Investment Corporation. The chief executive \nofficer is assisted in managing the daily operations of the bank by a strong senior management \nteam, all with considerable banking and finance experience. \n \n16.  Risk management. ABB is governed by a board of directors-approved Risk Management \nPolicy that oversees all aspects of risk including credit, operational, market, liquidity, interest rate, \ncompliance, and human resource risks. The board level risk management committee is updated \nquarterly with major risks also being discussed with the supervisory board. ABB\u2019s credit risk \nmanagement framework is captured in its credit policy, under which the bank has established \nunderwriting  criteria  for  various  product  categories  based  on  the  customer\u2019s  credit  profile. \nOperational risk management is carried out through a comprehensive system of internal controls, \nseparation of duties between key functions, and detailed standard operating procedures. Market \nrisk management is carried out by the assets\u2013liabilities committee, which assesses various \nmarket risks and manages the bank\u2019s liquidity position. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2003.

ADB will provide a senior unsecured loan to ABB of up to $100 million for up to 5 years. \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  Use of proceeds. ABB will use the proceeds of ADB\u2019s loan to finance business loans to \nMSMEs in Viet Nam. \n \n19.  Monitoring and reporting. ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department will monitor the \nproject. ABB will, at predetermined regular intervals and as requested, provide ADB with financial \nreports,  including  (i)  quarterly  unaudited  financial  statements,  (ii)  annual  audited  financial \nstatements, (iii) quarterly compliance certificates for financial covenants, (iv) semiannual reporting \non the MSME loan portfolios, (v) annual reporting on selected development indicators agreed \nupon  by  ADB  and  ABB,  and  (vi)  annual  environmental  and  social  management  system \nperformance report. \n \n20.  Evaluation. Monitoring reports will be prepared and submitted to ADB regularly, and at \nleast  annually.  The  first  report  will  be  submitted  no  later  than  12  months  after  the  first \ndisbursement. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n21.  Support the growth of micro, small, and medium enterprises and the development \nof the missing middle. ADB funding will support the growth of ABB\u2019s MSME financing portfolio, \nproviding needed financial products and services to this underserved segment. In addition to \nproviding MSMEs with access to finance to support working capital and investment needs, the \nproposed transaction will also contribute to enterprise development and broader economic growth \nthrough job creation. The intervention will also indirectly support ongoing technical assistance to \na financial technology company that is partnering with ABB to pilot digital products and services \ntargeting MSMEs.10 \n \n22.  Provide access to longer tenor debt. ABB largely relies on short-term deposits for its \nfunding. To diversify its funding sources, fund its longer tenor MSME portfolio (which is expected \nto grow in the medium term), and comply with new SBV regulations, ABB must raise longer tenor \nfinancing. The proposed transaction would contribute to this effort. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n \nIV.  DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \n \nA.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n23.  Impact. The project is aligned with the following impact: enhanced access to finance for \nthe underserved, contributing to financial sector development in alignment with the government\u2019s \n                                                \n10 This support for financial technology pilots is financed through the Government of Australia-funded Mekong Business \nInitiative, which is managed by ADB\u2019s Southeast Asia Department. \n ", "6 \n \nsocioeconomic  development  strategy  (2011\u20132020)  and  its  accompanying  socioeconomic \ndevelopment  plan  (2016\u20132020),  which  lay  out  a  vision  for  socially  equitable  economic \ndevelopment. The transaction will also align with the new Law on Supporting SMEs. \n \n24.  Outcome. The project will have the following outcome: the provision of sustainable \nfinancial services to MSMEs as ABB successfully expands its business. \n \n25.  Outputs. The outputs will be (i) ABB\u2019s increased capacity for MSME lending, and (ii) \nABB\u2019s increased capacity for women-owned MSME lending. \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n26.  ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 emphasizes ADB\u2019s support to the financial sector \nby helping to develop financial infrastructure, institutions, and products and services. 11 The \nproposed transaction contributes to financial sector development by supporting the growth of a \nfinancial institution, an important component of Viet Nam\u2019s financial sector. ADB\u2019s Midterm \nReview of Strategy 2020 also seeks to promote inclusive growth. Without access to formal \nfinancial services, underserved segments of the population will be excluded from the growth \nprocess and its benefits. According to ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Viet Nam, 2016\u2013\n2020 and country operations business plan for Viet Nam, 2017\u20132019, ADB\u2019s nonsovereign \noperations will support investments that promote more inclusive economic growth based on \npromoting  job  creation  and  competitiveness.12 The  proposed  transaction  will  support  the \ndevelopment of MSMEs in Viet Nam, part of the inclusive economic growth objective identified in \nthe country partnership strategy, and a high government priority. \n \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n27.  This transaction is classified as category FI for impacts on the environment and FI treated \nas  C  for  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples.  The  transaction's  potential \nenvironmental and social impacts, risks associated with the financial intermediary's existing \nand/or likely future portfolio, and commitment to and capacity for environmental and social \nmanagement have been assessed. ABB has an existing environmental and social management \nsystem under which an exclusion list and procedures based on the loan size are applied to \naddress projects\u2019 environmental and social risks. ABB will use the proposed loan to support \nMSME  finance,  targeting  customers  involved  in  a  variety  of  sectors  including  trading, \nmanufacturing, service, retail, agribusiness, wholesale, and distribution. ABB will not use ADB \nfunding to finance projects classified as category A for environmental impacts or category A or B \nfor involuntary resettlement or indigenous peoples. ABB will apply ADB's prohibited investment \nactivities list, ensure that investments using ADB funds abide by applicable national laws and \nregulations, and comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. It will also comply with national \nlabor laws and, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy (2001), will take measures to comply \nwith internationally recognized core labor standards.13 ABB will report regularly to ADB on its \ncompliance with such laws, and any measures taken.
