At the 39th Annual Meeting of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in Hyderabad, India \nin May 2006, representatives of the Government of India suggested that ADB support studies \non the development experience of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) in order to benefit \nIndia and other developing countries. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) of the Government of PRC \nsupported  this  suggestion  and  also  expressed  its  interest  in  studying  India\u2019s  development \nexperience.  Further,  the  PRC\u2019s  MOF  requested  a  tripartite  meeting  in  Beijing  with  the \nparticipation of ADB, India, and PRC to discuss the program of studies. Both PRC\u2019s MOF and \nthe MOF of the Government of India requested that ADB provide regional technical assistance \n(RETA) for conducting the studies. The underlying theme of this exchange of development \nexperiences is to obtain an Indian perspective on PRC development experience through study \nby Indian think tanks and scholars and, likewise, to acquire a PRC perspective on Indian \ndevelopment experiences through study by PRC think tanks and scholars. \n \n2.  A meeting was organized in Beijing on 12 February 2007 to discuss the objective and \nbroad scope of studies, implementation arrangements, tentative timetable, and possible ADB \nsupport for the program of studies. Attending the meeting were representatives of PRC\u2019s MOF, \nthe Indian Embassy in Beijing, the Institute of Public Policy Studies of Peking University (IPPS-\nPU), the Indian Council for Research and International Economic Relations (ICRIER), and ADB. \nThe participants decided to concentrate the studies on four sectors of strategic interest to each \ncountry. Key findings and insights from sector-level studies and the overall reform experiences \nof PRC and India will be further summarized in an analytical overview to draw lessons for other \ndeveloping member countries (DMCs) and emerging middle-income countries.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  While the PRC and India are now among the fastest growing economies in the world, the \ndrivers of economic growth, as well as its pattern and impact are not the same in the two \ncountries. For instance, manufacturing exports driven by foreign direct investment (FDI) and \nmassive  public  investments  in  infrastructure  have  been  the  main  driving  forces  of  PRC\u2019s \neconomy in recent years. In India, by contrast, FDI and public investment have played a \nrelatively minor role. India has seen strong growth in the services sector that has been driven by \ninternationally  competitive  native  firms.  Reforms  in  the  PRC  had  an  immediate  impact  on \nalleviating poverty in the early 1980s while India\u2019s record in this has been more modest. \n \n4.  The diverse and rich development experiences of these two countries emanate from \ndifferences in their economic policies and systems, as well as their social diversities. Yet, the \ndevelopment  challenges  facing  the  PRC  and  India  are  similar  and  daunting.  Some  key \nchallenges  include:  continued  dependence  of  large  proportions  of  the  populations  on \nsubsistence agriculture, creating viable employment for the large underemployed labor forces, \nmigration  to  urban  areas,  social  tensions  during  transition,  energy  security,  environmental \ndegradation, and management of scarce natural resources\u2014particularly water. In the face of \nthese  difficulties,  an  additional  challenge  is  to  maintain  sufficient  momentum  in  economic \nreforms to improve the efficiency of markets. The PRC and India can learn from one another \nand from their rich development experiences with the aim of meeting their common challenges. \nMore importantly, the development experiences of these two countries will be of strategic and \npractical interest to other DMCs and emerging middle-income countries in the region. \n   \n ", "2     \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n5.  The RETA will help the PRC and India to implement a program of studies on their \ndevelopment  experiences.  Both  governments  consider  the  program  of  immense  strategic \nimportance and practical use to them as well as to other emerging middle-income countries in \nthe region. The RETA will be implemented in two phases. Phase 1 will focus on in-depth sector \nand country-level studies of interest to the PRC and India. Phase 2 will focus on summarizing \nthe  technical  assistance  (TA)  findings  to  draw  lessons  for  other  DMCs  and  on  their \ndissemination. The TA\u2019s design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The RETA is expected to improve awareness among policy and opinion makers in the \nPRC and India about one another\u2019s development experience in selected sectors and areas. This \nwould lead to improved collaboration between the PRC and India on development policy issues \nin the selected sectors. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n7.  The RETA will conduct studies on, and facilitate dissemination in the Asia-Pacific region \nof, lessons from the PRC\u2019s and India\u2019s development experiences. To achieve this, the TA will be \nimplemented in two phases. Phase 1 will consist of (i) conducting in-depth studies to analyze \nthe development experience in sectors of strategic interest to the PRC and India and on the \noverall progress of economic reforms, and (ii) drawing lessons from the in-depth studies for \ndevelopment policy. Phase 2 will focus on widely disseminating the findings. The RETA will \nhave four major outputs:  \n \n(i)  Analytical overview of overall reform experience of India and in-depth studies in \nfour sectors or areas of interest to the Government of the PRC. Tentatively, these \nsectors and areas are: (a) the professional and higher education sector and its \ncontribution to economic growth; (b) growth of the services sector, with special \nfocus on information technology; (c) growth of internationally competitive local \nentrepreneurship; and (d) the financial sector, capital market reforms, and growth \nin  the  use  of  sophisticated  financial  instruments.  The  output  includes \ndissemination of these findings in the PRC. \n(ii)  Analytical overview of overall reform experience of the PRC and in-depth studies \nin four sectors or areas of interest to the Government of India. Tentatively, these \nsectors and areas are: (a) FDI-funded and export-oriented mass manufacturing, \n(b)  labor  sector  reforms,  (c)  financing  and  implementation  of  infrastructure \nprojects, and (d) state-owned enterprise reforms and restructuring. The output \nincludes dissemination of these findings in India. \n(iii)  Based on the findings of the eight studies, identification of potential areas for \ncooperation in development policy between the PRC and India. \n(iv)  A concise analytical report that is based on in-depth sector studies of PRC and \nIndian  development  experiences,  as  well  as  on  wider  developmental  policy \nissues  of  interest  to  other  DMCs1 and  middle-income  countries.  The  output \nincludes wide dissemination of the study findings. \n \n                                                 \n1  In particular, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Viet Nam. \n ", "  3\nC.  Cost and Financing \n8.  The total cost of the proposed RETA, estimated at $954,000, will be financed by a grant \nfrom ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The RETA proceeds will cover consulting services, exchange \nvisits by scholars, regional meetings, international travel, publications, as well as seminar and \nworkshop costs. The detailed cost estimates for the proposed RETA are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n9.  The MOFs of the PRC and India, in consultation with ADB, identified the IPPS-PU to \nconduct  such  studies  for  the  PRC  and  the  ICRIER  to  conduct  the  studies  for  India.  The \nselections were made on mutual understanding between ADB and the governments, based on \nthe following broad criteria: (i) experience in conducting research and training in the areas of \npublic policy and international economic relations, (ii) international reputation for research and \ntraining capabilities, (iii) strong and experienced faculty and adequate research infrastructure, \nand (iv) stature and experience for providing independent advice to the government. \n \n10.  Both  the  governments  endorsed  the  RETA  which  will  be  supervised  by  a  steering \ncommittee  comprising  two  representatives  from  each  government  and  from  ADB. 2  All \nconsultants  for  the  RETA  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB  guidelines.3 Where \nprocurement will be necessary under the RETA, that also will be in accordance with ADB \nguidelines.4 ADB will be the executing agency for the RETA. The IPPS-PU and ICRIER will be \nengaged by ADB on a single source selection basis.  \n11.  The IPPS-PU was established as the national center for research and training in the \narea  of  public  policy  at  Peking  University.  The  IPPS-PU  has  a  core  faculty  of  15  senior \nprofessors. This multidisciplinary institution supplements its core faculty by drawing eminent and \nexperienced faculty from the various departments of Peking University, from senior government \npolicymakers, and from other national-level institutions. ICRIER is one of India\u2019s premier policy \nresearch institutions. It has six key areas: strategic aspects of India\u2019s external relations, regional \nand bilateral issues, issues related to the World Trade Organization, global financial integration, \ninternational trade, and macroeconomic management. It has a permanent faculty of 17 scholars \nand draws on external expertise in both academia and government. The Institute has good \nexperience providing policy advice to governments. \n12.  In  Phase  1,  the  country-level  in-depth  studies  will  be  carried  out  by  IPPS-PU  and \nICRIER. PRC scholars will study the sectors of their interest in India with assistance from \nICRIER. Similarly, Indian scholars will carry out the studies on the PRC with assistance from \nIPPS-PU. Each institution will produce a two-part report. The first part will provide an overview \nof reforms in the country. The second part of the report will contain in-depth studies on selected \nsectors and provide an assessment of the potential and areas for bilateral cooperation. The \nsector reports will also include sector-level policy briefs. The results of the sector studies will be \ndisseminated  in  both  countries.  These  tasks  will  be  accomplished  under  a  collaboration \nframework to be agreed during the scoping workshop (see paragraph 15). The framework will \nprovide details regarding the exchange visits, sharing of data and information, peer review of \n                                                 \n2  Represented  by the East  Asia Department, the South Asia Department, and the Economic and Research \nDepartment. \n3  ADB. 2007.

The study design is shown \nschematically in Appendix 4.  \n13.  Phase 2 of the TA will focus on (i) preparing a concise analytical summary of the findings \nfrom the in-depth sector studies done in Phase 1 and drawing inferences for development policy \nin  other  DMCs  and  middle-income  countries  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific,  (ii)  disseminate \ndevelopment lessons from the PRC and India in other DMCs, and (iii) publish the TA findings. \nData collected under the TA will be made accessible for further research. ADB will take the lead \nin implementing Phase 2. \n14.  An international development specialist will help the steering committee supervise the \nprogram of studies and coordinate the activities of ICRIER and IPPS-PU. The development \nspecialist will participate in all key activities of the TA, will be responsible for preparing the \nconcise analytical summary of country-level studies in Phase 2, and will ensure the quality of TA \noutputs in Phase 1. This specialist will be engaged intermittently for 7 person-months during the \ncourse of the study. National coordination specialists will be engaged intermittently for a period \nof 7 months to assist ADB and the international development specialist.6 Detailed terms of \nreference for these consultants are in Appendix 3. \n15.  Soon after approval of the RETA, a scoping workshop will be held to (i) firm up the \nunderstandings reached on the sectors to be studied in each country; (ii) determine the detailed \nscope of coverage of each sector study, including the terms of reference for the writers of \nindividual  papers;  (iii)  agree  on  the  collaboration  framework  between  the  institutions;  (iv) \ndetermine the procedure for reviewing the progress of studies and their quality; (v) agree on the \noutline of the final study; (vi) discuss options for effective dissemination of TA findings; and (vii) \ndiscuss other administrative arrangements. Both the participating institutions, members of the \nsteering committee, and ADB will participate in this workshop. \n16.  The RETA is expected to be completed in 12 months, which includes 8 months for \nPhase 1 and 4 months for Phase 2. The RETA will aim to commission sector studies in July \n2007 and complete them by March 2008. Phase 2 could commence in March 2008 and end in \nJune 2008. Presentations under this phase would include a seminar during the ADB Annual \nMeeting in 2008, to be followed by dissemination in DMCs in June 2008.  \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n17.
