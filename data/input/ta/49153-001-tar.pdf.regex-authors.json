INTRODUCTION \n1.  Viet Nam has made remarkable progress since the 1990s in transforming its economy, \nreducing  poverty,  and  making  the  transition  toward  an  industrialized  and  urban  society. \nHowever, the quality and reach of urban infrastructure and services has not kept pace with \nnational vision, policy, and strategy. The ability of cities to effectively manage their environment \nand well-being of the population, sustain balanced growth, and tackle climate change impacts is \nnot  only  determined  by  sector  legislation  but  also  by  the  framework  of  outdated  urban \nregulations that is still in force. There is disconnect between the existing urban governance \nsystem, a legacy of a centrally planned economy, and that required by vibrant cities in an \nemerging market economy, particularly when confronted with climate change uncertainties.  \n \n2.  The present planning system does not encourage the local government to effectively \nprepare for the impacts of climate change. Key urban planning legislation does not refer to \nclimate change, despite having been promulgated after the government\u2019s flagship  National \nTarget Program to Respond to Climate Change.1 Incentives to develop peri-urban areas and a \nlack of willingness to densify the core city center propel cities toward sprawl, development in \nhigh-risk areas such as floodplains, and the inefficient management of resources. In response to \nthese  shortcomings,  the  government  decided  to  formulate  a  national  urban  development \nstrategy (NUDS) as a central policy instrument to manage and guide urban development in \npartnership with local governments. The process will be managed by the Urban Development \nAgency (UDA), within the Ministry of Construction (MOC).  \n \n3.  The NUDS will be formulated in two phases: (i) a foundation phase funded by Cities \nAlliance2 to  assess  the  current  status  of  urban  development  in  Viet  Nam  and  review \ninternational experience; and (ii) a second phase to develop the key objectives and complete \nthe formulation of the NUDS. Through MOC, the government requested technical assistance \n(TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to assist with the development of the second \nphase.3 Starting with a broad-based needs assessment and service coverage inventory, the \noutcome of the NUDS will include specific urban climate change resilience targets. Following \nconsultations with MOC and development partners, ADB conducted a TA fact-finding mission in \nAugust 2015 and reached a preliminary understanding with the government on the TA\u2019s impact, \noutcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, costs, financing arrangements, and terms of \nreference. These were confirmed in a memorandum of understanding signed by ADB and the \ngovernment on 4 September 2015. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.4 \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  The economic transformation that has characterized Viet Nam\u2019s development is linked to \nthe growth of its urban centers. Today, at least 70% of gross domestic product is generated in \nViet Nam\u2019s cities. A vibrant and growing industrializing economy needs efficient urban centers. \nAn emergent urban population drives local consumption and attracts new skills and further \ninvestment. However, industries and cities consume disproportionally and generate waste and \npollution. These need to be managed to protect the environment and sustain growth. \n \n                                                \n1  Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment. 2008. National Target Program to Respond To Climate Change. \nHanoi. \n2  Grant agreement signed on 31 August 2015. \n3  The TA concept paper was approved on 7 August 2015; the TA was included in the COBP 2014\u20132016 under the \nname Sustainable Urban Development in Viet Nam: Green Cities. \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 25 September 2015.  \n ", "2   \n5.  The current urban planning protocol in Viet Nam does not serve the rapidly evolving \nneeds of an industrial and urbanizing society. Cities do not have reliable, regular, or adequate \nfinancial resources to fund capital development or maintenance for urban infrastructure and \nservices\u2014an essential condition for delivering their obligations to citizens and businesses, and \nfor  planning  future  expansion.  Proactive  and  responsive  urban  management,  including \ndevelopment controls (to protect resources, guide land use, and anticipate future needs), are \nstill relatively new concepts in Viet Nam, although some responsibilities are vested on central \ngovernment and provinces.5 The current Law on Urban Planning stresses the decentralization of \nurban planning responsibilities and requires stakeholder consultation.6 A major challenge in \nachieving substantive decentralization is the lack of capacity at subnational level in planning, \nurban management, budgeting and financial management. \n \n6.  Urban and provincial development is guided by three types of plans: (i) subnational \nsocio-economic development plans; (ii) spatial plans (construction master plans) prepared at \nfour levels of geographic detail; and (iii) sector development plans defined by line ministries. \nProvincial  or  city  construction  master  plans  guide  the  planning  and  implementation  of \ninfrastructure projects, but may not necessarily be in line with sector development plans and the \nstated government vision. Master plans are prescriptive for land use rather than permissive and \nare not linked to financing realities. \n \n7.  Viet Nam is likely to be severely affected by climate change, in particular those cities in \ndeltas and the flat coastal strip, where extreme weather events and sea-level rising will increase \nthe risk of flooding and salt water intrusion. The present planning system does not encourage \nurban local government to effectively prepare for the impacts of climate change,7 while key \nurban planning legislation does not refer to climate change.8 With limited options for local \nrevenue generation, cities sometimes opt to trade land to pay for development needs, creating \nperverse incentives resulting in sprawl and development in high-risk areas, such as floodplains. \nUnder the current policy, cities are not encouraged to address climate and disaster risks and \ninstead focus on expansion. There are also no legal obligations to reassess existing spatial \nsettlement structures or re-examine existing spatial plans through climate change resilience \naudits to reduce vulnerability to climate change. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The impact of the TA will be the achievement of a low-carbon economy and green \ngrowth  sustainable  development.9 The  outcome  will  be  the  mainstreaming  of  climate  and \ndisaster resilience into the management of urban development.10 \n                                                \n5  See also Decree 131/2006, on decentralizing the management and utilization of official development assistance. \n6  Urban Planning Law 32/2009/QH/12. \n7  Schreiner, M. 2013. \u201cThe topography of the legal framework for urban development in Viet Nam\u201d in Towards Green \nand Resilient Cities in Viet Nam.

Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA will assist the government in pragmatically transforming the framework for urban \nplanning and governance, so that Vietnamese cities may be able to effectively participate in \nregional and global economies, increase resilience and sustainability, and address uncertainties \nimposed by climate change. To this end, the TA will assist the government with the formulation, \nintroduction, and application of a new national urban development strategy, which is in line with \nrecently adopted legislation.  \n \n10.  The  TA  will  have  three  outputs:  (i)  national  urban  resilience  strategy  and  program \nprepared by 2018; (ii) national urban planning capacity improved by 2017; and (iii) capacity \ndeveloped to implement climate change resilience at provincial and city levels.  The urban \nresilience program prepared under output 1 will be informed by pilots and capacity development \nundertaken in outputs 2 and 3 of the TA. The TA will be delivered in collaboration with a parallel \nproject funded through a grant by Cities Alliance to MOC for the preparation of NUDS (footnote \n2). This project includes an assessment of the current status of urban development in Viet Nam, \nbased on a survey, and a facility for the training of senior urban managers. The Cities Alliance \nproject outputs will be supportive of and complementary to the TA.  \n \n11.  The  preparation  of  NUDS  further  develops  and  details  the  existing  National  Urban \nDevelopment Program, a cornerstone of an emerging\u2014but as yet insufficiently articulated\u2014\nurban  development  policy  framework.  The  new  NUDS  document  will  explicitly  incorporate \nsustainable  and  resilient  elements  into  urban  development  for  implementation  across  the \ncountry. As part of output 1, the TA will assist the formulation of NUDS and will seek acceptance \nby local government. To achieve this, the TA will consult with and gain explicit endorsement by \nlocal government, as this is essential to achieve sustainable impact of urban development \nplans. Consistent with its strategic importance, the NUDS will be endorsed as a national policy \nstatement, through a decision issued by the Prime Minister.  \n \n12.  Under output 1, the TA will also assist the government with the formulation of a target \nprogram for urban climate change resilience (UCCR). As an essential strategic component \nneeded to include climate change resilience in urban planning and governance, the target \nprogram for UCCR will be a follow-on program to the 2008 National Target Program to Respond \nto Climate Change (footnote 1), promoting its effective application in urban planning beyond \n2015. Through capacity development, the TA will pilot these principles at provincial level, and in \nthis way gain support for the adoption of climate-change-resilient development plans (output 3). \n \n13.  Using  results  from  the  analysis  of  sector  performance,  and  benefitting  from  the \nexperience in the formulation of urban development plans at subnational level (output 3), the TA \nwill also formulate a UCCR investment framework under output 1. This framework, with a 15-\nyear planning horizon, will identify remaining gaps in urban policies and institutions and define \nproject selection criteria to prioritize and determine a future 15-year investment program for the \nurban sector through results-based lending. Guided by the policy directives formulated in the \nUCCR investment framework, the TA will identify an indicative pipeline of urban climate change \nresilient investments that promote inclusive local economic development. Data on levels of \nexisting infrastructure and services will be drawn from the UDA database and indicators on \nurban performance will be defined. \n \n14.  Cognizant of the importance that adapted housing has under NUDS, output 2 of the TA \nwill pilot a climate- and disaster-resilient housing model suitable for living with storm surges and \n ", "4   \nfloods in coastal areas, which are affected by extreme weather events.11 The assistance will \nadapt resilient construction models for target provinces, which will be based on a review of best \npractices in Viet Nam and their suitability for the Mekong region.12 Construction materials will be \nselected  for  resilience  to  weather  changes,  environmental  sustainability,  affordability,  local \naccessibility and durability. Design and construction will consider the need for local maintenance \nwith limited assistance from construction companies.13 The project will  conduct training on \nresilient construction and undertake 3 pilots for future replication. The TA will record its findings \nin a manual for low-cost climate-resilient construction. \n \n15.  Under output 3, the TA will pilot new planning features outlined under NUDS by guiding \nthe  formulation  of  three  provincial  and/or  regional  urban  development  plans.  The  TA  will \nencourage regional planning and coordination in recognition of the need for (i) more balanced \nand targeted distribution of investments, (ii) avoiding counterproductive competition for limited \nresources among adjacent provinces, and (iii) identifying unique provincial assets and strengths \nthat can synergize regional production. This leverages and builds on existing collaboration with \nADB  on  the  development  of  economic  corridors  within  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  to \nenhance trade and tourism. Critical to the relevance and sustainable impact of NUDS will be \nacceptance and application at subnational (provincial) levels. \n \n16.  The TA will test the formulation of urban development plans in at least six cities by taking \nthem through a process of acceptance by the local administration. The original scope of these \nplans will be expanded to take the form of urban climate change action plans, consistent with \nglobal  trends  of  climate-resilient  planning.  Urban  development  plans  will  recognize  in  the \nprocess of formulation and outcomes, the effect that climate change may have on urban areas \nand how urban infrastructure and services should be planned and designed to make vulnerable \nurban groups more resilient.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,505,000 equivalent, of which (i) $1,960,000 will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the United States Agency for International Development and (ii) \n$545,000 equivalent (\u20ac500,000) will be financed on a grant basis by the Nordic Development \nFund. Both funds will be administered by ADB. The government will provide counterpart support \nin the form of counterpart staff, office accommodation, office supplies, secretarial assistance, \nand other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  ADB will be the executing agency. The MOC, through its Urban Development Agency \n(UDA),  will  be  the  implementing  agency.  UDA  will  coordinate  with  the  provincial  people\u2019s \ncommittees and the departments of construction of the target cities and provinces. Project \ncoordinators will be appointed to manage the TA. A consultative steering committee, chaired by \nMOC  with  representatives  from  the  government  agencies,  development  partners,  and  civil \nsociety will meet at least twice a year to monitor the progress of the TA. The TA will be \nimplemented over 34 months and is expected to start on 1 March 2016 and be completed on 31 \nDecember 2018. \n                                                \n11 As part of the guidelines to improve national urban planning. \n12 P.

The TA will finance 91 person-months of international consultants and 169 person-\nmonths of national consultants. One firm will be recruited using ADB\u2018s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time), following a fixed budget selection, with a full \ntechnical proposal, and a lump sum contract, to deliver  the three outputs for a budget of \n$2 million. The firm will provide 61 person-months of international consultants and 97 person-\nmonths of national consultants (Appendix 3). The remaining consultants will be recruited as \nindividual consultants, recognizing their unique skills in urban development, thematic and sector \nexpertise,  including  land  use  administration  (1  international),  knowledge  management  (2 \ninternational),  urban  policy  (1  international  and  1  national)  and  project  coordination  (1 \ninternational and 1 national) to support the TA administration and reporting to the cofinanciers. \nConsultants will be recruited under advance action. Procurement of works and goods under the \nprovisional  sum  to  be  managed  by  the  firm  will  be  done  in  accordance  with  the  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time), following shopping procedures \nfor the pilot shelter housing as part of the training and capacity development. Design reviews \nand construction supervision will be undertaken by the city department of construction. The \nproceeds of the TA will be disbursed in accordance with the Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n20.  The sustainable impact of the TA will be disseminated by and evidenced through a \nPrime Minister\u2019s Decision on the National Urban Development Strategy (NUDS). The NUDS will \nbe the central instrument to manage and guide resilient urban development. Plans will have \nbeen  formulated,  approved,  and  published  at  regional,  provincial,  and  local  levels  using \nparticipatory processes approved by appropriate provincial people\u2019s committees. Advice will be \nprovided  under  the  TA.  The  manual  for  climate-resilient  housing  construction  will  be \ndisseminated through training workshops. Each workshop will leverage local expertise and train \nlocal companies to conduct civil works, constructing ten houses in each city. Local community \nmembers will be involved to develop their construction skills.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION AND DECISION \n \n21.  The President recommends that the Board approve ADB administering a portion of \ntechnical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,960,000 to the Government of Viet Nam \nfor Sustainable and Resilient Urban Development, to be financed on a grant basis by the United \nStates Agency for International Development. If the Board approves ADB administering the \ntechnical assistance, the President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, approves \nADB administering the balance of the technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of \n$545,000 (\u20ac500,000) to be financed on a grant basis by the Nordic Development Fund, to the \nGovernment of Viet Nam for Sustainable and Resilient Urban Development. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the TA is Aligned with: \nLow-carbon economy and green growth sustainable development achieved (National Climate Change \nStrategy, 2011)  \nPerformance Indicators  Data Sources or \nResults Chain  with Target Baselines   Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome  By 2019:     \nClimate change and  A series of urban investment  TA final report  Policy makers do \ndisaster resilience  programs prepared with    not revise \nmainstreamed into  climate-resilience features  Report to USAID on  necessary guidance \nurban development   for 2018\u20132027  indicator on Legal/Policy  for provincial \n  Environment (#4.2.8-28)  planning.  \n  and institutional capacity   \n(#4.8.2-14)  Government \nreduces borrowing \nfor urban sector. \nOutputs   By 2018:     \n1.

The  consultant  contracts  will  be \nadministered by ADB with UDA, MOC as the counterpart agency of the government. The terms \nof reference are output-based to suit a fixed budget selection and match the TA methodology. \nThe consulting firm is expected to (i) review and comment on the suggested methodology; and \n(ii) propose a project team to achieve the TA objectives and the output. The firm will mobilize \nexperts based on the identified gaps. \n \n1.  Output 1: The methodology to complete the assignment will be guided by the following \nprinciples:  \n(i)  Analysis of gaps in urban planning and urban development policies over the next \n15 years, in coordination with the consultants recruited under the Foundation / \nScoping Phase by Cities Alliance. The gap analysis will cover all the policies \nrelated to basic urban services (energy, water supply, wastewater, drainage and \nwaste management), housing, urban transportation (especially public transport \nand  access for  walking  or  cycling),  disaster management, food  security  and \npublic health. A policy framework will be prepared for up to 10 identified gaps \nwith  coverage  of  the  full  policy  cycle  from  identification  to  implementation, \nincluding monitoring, enforcement and evaluation. Priority policies (up to 10) will \nbe identified through transparent selection criteria. \n(ii)  Definition and completion final draft of the NUDS for MOC drafting and Prime \nMinister approval. After adoption of the NUDS it is expected that all the provinces \nwill need to prepare a regional strategy for urban development based on the \nNUDS and on the Vietnam Green Growth Strategy of 2012. \n(iii)  Preparation  of  an  Urban  Climate  Change  Resilient  (UCCR)  investment \nframework  to  guide  the  future  investment  priorities  for  urban  development \nthrough a programmatic approach with the definition of a policy matrix to review \nlegal and institutional gaps in urban development to 2030 and a list of project \nselection criteria to be agreed between development partners and central and \nlocal  governments.  The  UCCR  investment  framework  may  follow  the  Global \nInfrastructure Basel1 on a standard for sustainable and resilient infrastructure and \nthe City Resilience Framework2 being used by the 100 Resilient Cities or the \nWestern  Balkan  Infrastructure  Investment  Framework  used  to  deliver  the \nMunicipal Infrastructure Support Programme for the Republic of Serbia.  \n(iv)  Preparation  of  selected  urban  planning  tools,  including  climate  change  risk \nassessment,  based  on  NUDS  and  the  National  Green  Growth  Strategy. \nProvincial and regional climate-resilient green growth strategies in the form of \nurban development programs; resilient city action plan, based on government \nurban development plans and ADB green city action plans. To assist with the \nfuture implementation of the NUDS (outside the scope of the TA, but a full part of \nthe scope of the project preparatory TA and the future lending program), tools \nare useful to standardize urban planning decision processes to be administered \nby the cities and the provinces. Such planning tools will be identified in the \nproposal and prepared by the consultant as part of this TA.

It is therefore expected that \nclimate change risk assessment tools will be developed to assist the process. \nThe  tools  will  be  prepared  based  on  readily  available  existing  data  and \nrecommendations on additional tools and further data requirements will also be \nproposed. The uncertainty of the intensity of climate change impacts have to be \nbalanced  against  the  certainty  necessary  for  preparation  of  infrastructure \nadaptation  projects  for  implementation.  The  \u201cmeasurable,  reportable,  and \nverifiable\u201d  criteria  often  used for  evaluating  projects may  not  be  suitable for \nclimate  change  adaptation  projects  because  many  adaptive  actions  cannot \nimmediately be measured or demonstrated. \n \n2.  Output 2: The methodology to complete the assignment will be guided by the following:  \n(i)  Preparation of guidelines on urban resilient land use planning. The consultant will \nreview existing and land-use plans and construction practices for urban and peri-\nurban areas for climate resilience and disaster risk reduction in the Mekong area. \nAn  urban  resilient  land  use  planning  and  infrastructure  framework  will  be \nprepared  under  this  output,  following  a  review  of  practices  and  practical \nrecommendations. The recommendations will be applied to pilot at least one \nresilient land-use plan, including protection measures for a low-income commune, \nwhich may include recommendations on upgraded resilient housing and urban \ninfrastructure.  To  facilitate  the  formulation  of  a  transparent  monitoring  and \nevaluation system, assistance will be provided to integrate existing databases of \nurban development and climate change and disaster risk information by Q3 2016. \nThe project includes pilot area in one province for land-use planning and capacity \nbuilding in climate and disaster resilient construction to determine best practices \nand document lessons learned, to be more responsive to natural disaster and \nclimate risk in the form of guidelines to supplement existing land-use decisions. \nThe recommendations will then be applied to pilot the resilient land-use plan, \nincluding low-income housing for a designated commune. Although the land use \nplan of the pilot site may exist, it needs to be reviewed and adjusted to better \nrespond to climate change related risks. Concurrently, the project will review \nexisting  master  plans  for  climate  resilience  and  disaster  risk  reduction \nconsiderations in at least six highly vulnerable low-income urban areas in An \nGiang, Dong Thap, Ca Mau, and Kien Giang Provinces by Q1 2017 and/or \nacross other ADB financed or proposed for funding projects. The guidelines will \nassist the usual land development planning such as management of residential, \ncommercial  and  industrial  developments,  cityscapes  and  environmental \nprotection while incorporating climate change in the designs. Two reports will he \nprepared: one report summarizing the review and recommendations on how to \ndevelop climate and disaster risk resilient land-use plans, and the other is the \nrevised land-use plan for the selected target area.3 \n(ii)  Preparation of guidelines and/or manual for low-cost resilient housing and pilots: \nSuitable planning mechanisms and low cost housing guidelines will be developed \nfor coping with storms and floods in coastal areas influenced by extreme weather \n                                                \n3  The guidance provided by the Nordic Development Fund-financed Adapting Urban Construction Plans to Climate \nChange in Vietnam by use of Strategic Environmental Assessment will be used as a framework for the TA. In Viet \nNam, the strategic environmental assessment is usually performed on a provincial scale. The guidance produced \ncould supplement the knowledge produced under the TA with MOC. \n ", "12          Appendix 3 \n \naddressing one of the major issues of the urban poor living in the peri-urban \nareas  of  the  cities.  Focusing  on  adapted  housing  as  one  of  NUDS\u2019  critical \nsubsectors, the TA will pilot a climate and disaster resilient housing model and \nknowledge suitable for living with storms and floods in coastal areas, which are \naffected by extreme weather. The assistance will adapt resilient construction \nmodels for the target provinces based on a review of best practices in Viet Nam \nand  their  suitability  for  the  Mekong  region.4 Construction  materials  will  be \nselected  for  high  levels  of  resilience  to  weather  changes,  environmental \nsustainability,  affordability,  local  accessibility  and  durability.  The  region  has \nplentiful  mangrove  forests,  palm  and  other  species  traditionally  used  for \nconstruction as well as other locally available construction material. However, the \nassistance needs to test their resilience and suitability and analyze the costs. An \nadditional requirement is that these homes can be maintained by local people \nwith limited assistance from local construction companies.5 The details relating to \nthe building structures will he determine through a planning process, which will \ninclude on-the-job capacity building. The project will develop a manual for low-\ncost  climate  resilient  housing  construction  in  the  target  area  including  costs \nnorms for material and construction. A minimum of 10 community houses will be \nbuilt in the target areas. The project will record its findings in a manual for low-\ncost climate resilient construction. \n(iii)  Preparation of Dissemination Plan and Capacity Building: The resilient housing \nconstruction manual will be disseminated through a series of hands-on training \nworkshops.  The  training  events  are  aimed  at  local  small  and  medium-sized \nenterprises (SMEs), construction contractors and local government officials. The \nproject will also seek to engage local SMEs who have the potential to develop \nand use the construction materials locally. During each training participants will \nengage in classroom based and field based leaning, including working on the \npilot construction of a climate-resilient house. Each training workshop will thus \nleverage local expertise and apply the knowledge on the job, producing at least \none  house  per  training.  Where  possible,  local  community  members  will  be \ninvolved in the workshops to develop their construction skills. Additionally, basic \ntraining will be provided on operation and maintenance of the resilient housing \nequipment, which may include solar water heating systems, rainwater harvesting, \nand waste management utilities. The capacity development will include three \nhands-on training events aimed at local SMEs, construction contractors, and \nlocal government officials to use the guidelines set out in the construction manual. \nIt is expected to train at least 12 government agencies with improved capacity to \naddress climate change issues and at least 100 individual stakeholders, including \n50% women and 30% from private sector for at least 50 days with increased \ncapacity to adapt to the impacts of climate change.

The urban development \nprograms will be formulated as a participatory planning exercise, including spatial \ndevelopment plans for climate change adaptation and mitigation. \n(ii)  Preparation of six urban development plans, developed in a participatory manner \nand incorporating climate change resilience. These will identify key infrastructure, \npolicy and institutional requirements in six priority cities and will act as precursors \nto the project preparatory TA. Cities will be prioritized on the basis of size and \nvulnerability. Under the NUDS, the urban development plans will be linked to the \ngreen cities action plan developed by ADB. \n(iii)  Definition of a project pipeline with prioritized urban infrastructure projects for \nclimate change mitigation and adaptation for the six priority cities to feed into the \nSustainable  and  Resilient  Urban  Development  Program.  The  pipeline  of \ninvestment projects will focus on economic and environmental infrastructure to \npromote in line with the government Socio-Economic Development Plan 2016\u2013\n2020, with ADB\u2019s GrEEEn Cities Concept (Environment, Equity, Economy). \n(iv)  Assessment of affordability of a sustainable and resilient urban infrastructure \ninvestment program at the city and province level based on the latest relending \ndecree from the Ministry of Finance. The strategies will be developed further to \nprioritize cities within each province and to prepare action plans for the prioritized \ncities, which will identify bankable development projects. The selected projects \nmust be sustainable from social, affordability and implementation aspects. \n(v)  Preparation of the basis of a programmatic approach to lending in the form of an \nupdated NTP for urban climate change resilience based on NUDS or any other \nnational document that would support program lending in urban climate change \nresilience.  The  program  approach,  as  opposed  to  project  approach  will  be \nadopted  in  the  implementation  of  NUDS  and  involves  identification  of  key \ndevelopment objectives for which policies are to be developed and adopted in \nthe NUDS and the UCCRIF. The policies will cover the means of implementation, \ncommunication and  feedback, monitoring and evaluation of effectiveness. The \nexisting NTP for urban climate change resilience (2008) focuses on gathering \ninformation and preparing plans. The progress in preparing plans and information \ngathering needs to be evaluated, so that the next phase covering implementation \ncan start. The updated NTP or any other modality suitable for the government to \ndeliver a program lending in sustainable and resilient urban development would \ninclude procedures to select priority sectors and related urban development and \nurban infrastructure projects following a programmatic approach. The updated \nNTP will be supported by the rapid assessment of the Viet Nam urban sector to \nexposure and vulnerability to climate change. The updated NTP will need to \nconsider the political and physical realities such as the political agenda, low \ncapacity at district levels, sector prioritization, performance measurement, private \nsector participation, funding possibilities and affordability. \n(vi)  Establishment  of  a  communication  and  knowledge  management  plan. \nCommunication and knowledge management plan for dissemination of the NUDS, \nthe associated strategies, frameworks and the implementation thereof will be \ndeveloped under the TA by the consultants, in coordination with the knowledge \nmanagement  consultants  I  (knowledge  paper)  and  II  (media)  recruited  as \nindividual consultants.  \n(vii)  Definition  of  options  for  private  sector  participation  and  public\u2013private \npartnerships in sustainable and resilient urban infrastructure investment program. \n ", "14          Appendix 3 \n \nThe involvement of the private sector in urban development and participation in \nclimate change adaptation activities will be investigated and up to five proposals \non  possible  involvement  of  the  private  sector  will  be  made  on  financing  or \ncofinancing urban infrastructure.
