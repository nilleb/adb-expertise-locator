INTRODUCTION \n1.  During  the  2015  country  programming  mission,  the  Government  of  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) requested policy and advisory technical assistance (TA) from the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) for poverty reduction in the Liupanshan area of Ningxia Hui \nAutonomous Region (NHAR).1 The TA was included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, \n2016\u20132018 for the PRC.2 In April 2016, an ADB mission visited NHAR, held discussions with \nlocal officials and stakeholders, and reached an understanding with the Ningxia Department of \nFinance  (NDOF)  and  other  stakeholders  on  the  TA  project\u2019s  impact,  outcome,  outputs, \nimplementation  arrangements,  cost,  financing  arrangements,  and  consultants\u2019  terms  of \nreference. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The PRC\u2019s Thirteenth Five-Year Plan (2016\u20132020)3 has set the target of alleviating \npoverty by 2020; and the Liupanshan area has been designated as one of the extremely poor \nareas under the PRC\u2019s national poverty alleviation program.4 The Liupanshan area includes a \nmountainous section in the southern part of NHAR, which is the poorest among the extremely \npoor areas. Out of NHAR\u2019s 22 counties, eight are national-level poor counties; and one is a \nprovincial-level poor county. Seven of NHAR\u2019s national-level poor counties are located in the \nLiupanshan  area:  Haiyuan,  Jingyuan,  Longde,  Pengyang,  Tongxin,  Xiji,  and  Yuanzhou \n(district).5 The Liupanshan area\u2019s population is 2.29 million, just about one-third of NHAR\u2019s total \npopulation of 6.67 million. The seven poor counties together have 1.93 million inhabitants, of \nwhich 69% are rural residents and 22% are under the national poverty line; 92 poor villages; \n111,600 poor households; and 424,400 poor women and men. The widespread poverty in the \nLiupanshan area is mainly the result of (i) a remote and harsh environment; (ii) inadequate \ninfrastructure and public services; (iii) low levels of industrial development and jobs; and (iv) \nlimited income-generating opportunities because of poor market access for local products, and \ninadequate local nonfarm employment. The rural\u2013urban gap in per capita income is huge. The \naverage disposable income for urban people is CNY25,186, while the average net income for \nrural people is CNY9,119. A large number of farmers have left their villages in search of jobs in \nurban areas. This has been a source of remittances, but it has also greatly reduced human \nresources and created many difficulties in rural areas. \n \n3.  The PRC and NHAR governments attach great importance to the development of the \nLiupanshan  area.  They  have  conducted  ecological  conservation  and  watershed  protection \nprograms, including prohibition of grazing and farming in areas with very harsh living conditions \nand desertification. Since 1983, the governments have also relocated a total of 1.16 million \npeople from places prone to natural hazards or with very difficult environments. These efforts \nhave  resulted  in  the  restoration  of  ecology;  and  some  ecological  benefits  have  started  to \nemerge, such as an increase in forests and grassland. Most slope lands (>25 degree) are now \ncovered  with  tree  plantations.  According  to  the  Ningxia  Forestry  Department,  the  forest \ncoverage in the seven poor counties in the Liupanshan area was 14.08% in 2015. This has \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 8 June 2016.  \n2  ADB. 2016.

The National \nTourism Administration has identified the Liupanshan area as an experimental zone of tourism. \n \n4.  During  the  Twelfth  Five-Year  Plan  (2011\u20132015)  period,  the  local  governments \nimplemented several programs aimed at reducing poverty by focusing on six bases: ecology, \neducation, information technology, transport, urbanization, and water supply. The programs \nincluded labor skills enhancement, industrial development, human capacity development, and \nfinancial  support.  However,  achieving  the  poverty  alleviation  target  and  a  sustained \nimprovement of living standards in rural areas remains difficult for several reasons: (i) the \nconstrained fiscal situation of local governments, which makes it difficult to continue or upscale \npoverty alleviation programs that require a large amount of funding; (ii) less-developed pro-poor \neconomic enterprises; (iii) low levels of education and skills among middle-aged farmers; and \n(iv) fewer livelihood opportunities for farmers.  \n \n5.  Rural tourism and local products have great potential to help reduce poverty with the \nparticipation of local governments, enterprises, and communities. The Liupanshan area and the \nHelan Mountain, where the famous Xia imperial tombs are located, are Ningxia\u2019s important \nmountain tourism areas. Tourism attractions in the Liupanshan area include Mount Sumeru \ncultural heritage site, Shizhaishan fire, Liupanshan national forest park, Dan Zhaiguo geoparks, \nold Longtan rouge gorge, yellow Tudor fort, Shanjiaji revolutionary sites,  and Xiji terraces. \nTourist arrivals and tourism revenues are showing upward trends. It is estimated that tourism \ncurrently contributes 6% of the Liupanshan area\u2019s gross domestic product. Local products with \ncomparative advantage are (i) herbs and livestock products; (ii) handicrafts and folk items; and \n(iii) wolfberries, flowers, and other special products.  \n \n6.  NHAR\u2019s  Thirteenth  Five-Year  Implementation  Plan  on  poverty  alleviation  in  the \nLiupanshan area identified tourism and local products as the key poverty alleviation measures.6 \nIt  set  the  following  targets  on  tourism  to  be  achieved  by  2020:  (i)  total  tourism  revenue \nequivalent to 9% of gross domestic product; (ii) direct employment of more than 30,000 people, \nand indirect employment to many farmers; (iii) development of more than 1,000 farmhouses; \n(iv) involvement of 3,000 poor households; and (v) an increase in annual per capita net income \nof poor households involved in tourism to CNY10,000. The plan calls for detailed studies of \nideas and goals for rural tourism and local products to strengthen poverty alleviation results, \nparticularly in poor counties in the Liupanshan area.    \n \n7.  The TA will help NHAR accomplish the priorities of the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan on \npoverty alleviation in the Liupanshan area, focusing on on-site solutions rather than relocation. \nThe TA will support studies on local poverty issues, and value chain analysis of tourism and \nlocal  products.  The  studies  will  improve  knowledge  and  capacity  of  local  governments  in \nplanning and implementing poverty reduction measures that focus on tourism and local products. \nThe knowledge on tourism and local products, and poverty reduction will be shared with the \nvarious stakeholders.      \n \n8.  ADB\u2019s strategic priorities in the country partnership strategy (CPS), 2016\u20132020 for the \nPRC include supporting inclusive development and reducing poverty and inequality.7 The CPS \nstates that ADB will assist the government\u2019s efforts in reducing poverty, particularly in the \nlesser-developed regions of the PRC. The PRC\u2019s Thirteenth Five-Year Plan has set a target of \n                                                \n6  NHAR. 2016. 13th Five-Year Implementation Plan on Regional Development and Poverty Alleviation in Liupanshan \nArea of Ningxia.

Impact and Outcome \n9.  The  impact  will  be  poverty  alleviation  and  improvement  of  rural  livelihoods  in  the \nLiupanshan area in NHAR. The outcome will be improved knowledge and capacity for planning \nand implementing poverty reduction measures in the Liupanshan area in NHAR. This will be \nmeasured by a circular issued by NDOF, which disseminates the recommended measures from \nthe studies on enhancing poverty reduction in the Liupanshan area. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will achieve the outcome through three outputs.  \n \n11.  Output  1:  Study  on  local  poverty  status  and  poverty  reduction  programs \nconducted. This output will analyze the poverty situation in the seven poor counties of the \nLiupanshan area and determine measures to boost alleviation efforts by reviewing literature and \ndatabases,  holding  detailed  discussions  with  local  governments,  and  consulting  with  local \nstakeholders. The study will be gender-inclusive and will focus on targeting the poor women and \nmen. The activities to achieve this output involve (i) examination of local poverty data and/or \ndatabases; and assessment of local poverty conditions, including poverty factors and issues of \nspecific social groups such as women, ethnic groups, and vulnerable households; (ii) review of \nongoing poverty alleviation programs, and assessment of their strengths and weaknesses; \n(iii) assessment  of  opportunities  and  challenges  for  poverty  reduction  in  the  seven  poor \ncounties; (iv) analysis of aspects of social and gender inclusion; (v) organization of consultation \nmeetings with local stakeholders (including specific social groups with at least 35% participation \nby women) to discuss issues and share information on poverty analysis; and (vi) synthesis of \nlessons  from  the  review  of  ongoing  poverty  alleviation  programs,  and  recommendation  of \nmeasures to boost poverty alleviation and improve rural livelihoods in respective counties and \namong specific social groups. \n \n12.  Output 2: Value chain analysis of selected enterprises involved in tourism and \nlocal products conducted. This output will focus on tourism and local products and their \nimportance for reducing poverty and improving rural livelihoods in the Liupanshan area. The \nstudy  will  select  tourism  activities  and  local  products  based  on  their  inclusiveness  and \nsustainability, including their potential for job creation and livelihood improvement among the \nrural poor and low-income population. The study will be gender-inclusive in assessing and \nrecommending measures for creating jobs for the poor. The activities to achieve this output \ninvolve (i) review of existing information on tourism and local products, including key local \nattractions, tourist numbers, trends, markets, visitor expenditure, contribution to employment, \naccessibility, and local products with comparative advantage; (ii) selection of enterprises for \nvalue chain analysis related to tourism and local products (about one per poor county), focusing \non those that are inclusive and would benefit the poor; (iii) value chain analysis of the selected \nenterprises,  including  the  analysis  of  demand,  supply,  financial  and  technical  aspects, \nsustainability, and benefit sharing; (iv) analysis of challenges and opportunities of relevant \nenterprises; (v) analysis of aspects of social and gender inclusion through collection of data on \ncreation of jobs for poor women and men; (vi) exploration of opportunities of public\u2013private\u2013\ncommunity  partnerships,  and  use  of  information  technology  by  relevant  enterprises;  and \n ", "4   \n(vii) recommendation of measures for improving, upgrading, and/or replicating enterprises. The \nmeasures will take into account the potential of enterprises to contribute to poverty reduction \nand improvement of livelihoods of women and men in rural areas.  \n \n13.  Output  3:  Knowledge  on  tourism  and  local  products,  and  poverty  reduction \nenhanced.  This  output  will  provide  (i)  knowledge-sharing  workshops  and  seminars  for \ngovernment officials and other stakeholders with a focus on lessons from outputs 1 and 2; with \nat least 35% participation by women; (ii) training on value chain analysis of tourism and local \nproducts  for  selected  local  officials  and  stakeholders;  (iii) circulation  of  the  reports  among \nrelevant governments and/or agencies; and (iv) preparation of a knowledge product on the TA \nfindings and dissemination through the websites of the government and ADB. Since poverty \nreduction is a national agenda, key agencies with mandates of poverty alleviation from the \nnational government (e.g., National Poverty Alleviation Office) will be also invited to attend \nknowledge-sharing seminars.  \n \n14.  All outputs will be undertaken in a participatory and social- and/or gender-inclusive \nmanner.  These  will  take  into  account  specific  issues  or  needs  of  different  social  groups, \nparticularly women, vulnerable people, and ethnic minorities. Priority will be given to eco-friendly, \nsustainable, and socially inclusive tourism activities and local products. Enterprises participating \nin the TA activities will be encouraged to adopt an inclusive business approach for livelihood \nimprovement of the poor and low-income women and men.8 Lessons from ADB\u2019s initiatives on \ninclusive businesses support will be taken into account.9 Findings by the project preparatory \nTA10 for the rural road improvement will also be taken into account when selecting enterprises \nfor poverty reduction, since the improved road network is expected to give these enterprises \nmarket access. Efforts will be made to maintain close coordination between this proposed TA, \nthe project preparatory TA and the ensuing loan for rural road improvement, and other relevant \nprograms in the seven poor counties in the Liupanshan area. Private sector as well as public \nsector agencies and enterprises involved in tourism and local products will be encouraged to \nparticipate in the TA workshops and knowledge-sharing events.  \n \n15.  The risk of delays in selecting enterprises for the study exists in some counties. Another \nrisk is that NDOF may fail to issue the circular to disseminate recommended measures from the \nstudies for the Liupanshan area on time. This may cause delays in implementing the measures. \nThese risks will be mitigated by close coordination with the pertinent local governments and \nregular communications with NDOF to ensure that required actions are undertaken on time. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $440,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office accommodation, secondary \ndata and documents, and other logistic support as in-kind contributions. The cost estimate and \nfinancing plan is in Appendix 2. \n \n                                                \n8  Companies that create scalable systemic and innovative solutions to the problems of the poor and low-income \nwomen and men (bottom 40%) are called inclusive businesses. \n9  ADB. 2013.

NDOF will be the \nexecuting agency and provide overall guidance. On behalf of NDOF, the Ningxia Department of \nSocial Sciences Management will (i) provide the TA Management Office and be responsible for \nday-to-day operations and communications with ADB, the TA consultants, and stakeholders; \nand (ii) coordinate between the government agencies, including the Ningxia Development and \nReform Commission, the Ningxia Poverty Alleviation Office, the Ningxia Women Federation, \nand  the  Ningxia  departments  of  agriculture,  finance,  tourism,  and  transport.  It  will  also \ncoordinate with the pertinent counties\u2019 poverty alleviation offices, and nationally, as needed. \n \n18.  The TA is estimated to require 6 person-months of international and 36 person-months \nof national consultants\u2014one international consultant (tourism and local products value chain \nspecialist, and deputy team leader) and three national consultants (poverty and social specialist, \nand team leader; tourism and local products value chain specialist; and a local facilitation and \nsurvey  specialist).  The  consultants  will  be  engaged  individually  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). Consultants will be \nengaged individually because (i) different experts with individual experience and qualifications \nare required, but collective responsibility is not a main requirement; (ii) additional outside and/or \nhome office support is not required; and (iii) individual engagement will be faster and more \nflexible for all four experts needed. Operational expenses for printing, survey, and organization \nof  TA-related  workshops  and  training  will  be  included  in  the  consultants\u2019  contracts.  The \nproceeds  of  the  TA  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). The outline terms of reference \nfor consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n19.  ADB will hold review missions during inception, and interim and final reviews of the TA. \nDuring these missions, ADB,  NDOF, the TA consultants, and stakeholders will review the \nprogress of the TA; and provide feedback for improvement of the TA implementation. The TA \nprogress will be measured against the design and monitoring framework and the consultants\u2019 \nwork plan. ADB missions will also monitor the governments\u2019 contributions, as documented in the \nTA report. ADB and NDOF will review the TA progress reports and provide feedback and \nguidance. The best practices and lessons learned will be disseminated through the TA reports, \nTA workshops, and publications. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Poverty Reduction in Liupanshan, \nNingxia Hui Autonomous Region, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact of the Project is Aligned with \nPoverty alleviation and improvement of rural livelihoods in the Liupanshan area in the Ningxia Hui \nAutonomous Region achieved.  \n(NHAR\u2019s Thirteenth Five-Year Plan on Poverty Alleviation in the Liupanshan Area, 2016\u20132020)a  \nPerformance Indicators with  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Reporting  Risks \nOutcome  By June 2018     \nKnowledge and  A circular issued by the  NDOF\u2019s annual  NDOF fails to issue the \ncapacity for planning  Ningxia Department of  report and the  circular on time, which \nand implementing  Finance (NDOF) to  technical assistance  may cause delays in \npoverty reduction  disseminate recommended  (TA) completion  implementing the \nmeasures in the  measures from the studies on  report  recommended \nLiupanshan area  enhancing poverty reduction  measures.  \nimproved.    in the Liupanshan area \n(2016 baseline: 0; target: 1) \nOutputs       \n1.
