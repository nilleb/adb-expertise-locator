INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) requested assistance from the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) during the 2003 country programming mission to provide \nadvisory support for the Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise (SME) Department of the National \nDevelopment  and  Reform  Commission  (NDRC). In response to the request, a fact-finding \nmission1  visited  Beijing  on  12\u201316  January  2004  to  ascertain  the  objectives,  scope,  and \nimplementation arrangement for the technical assistance (TA).2 The TA logical framework is in \nAppendix 1.  Since 1998, the Government has given high priority to SME development to \nstimulate  economic  demand  and  increase  employment.  However,  most  SMEs  encounter \ndifficulties in accessing finance. SME financing has been the key focus of government policies. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  SMEs3 play a significant role in the economy. They account for almost half of gross \ndomestic product (GDP), two thirds of industrial value added, 60% of exports, and 40% of fiscal \nrevenue. SMEs also provide 75% of urban jobs. Private SMEs have grown faster than the larger \nstate-owned enterprises. The industrial output of SMEs has been increasing at an annual \naverage rate of 30%, compared to 20% for the industry as a whole. Despite the rapidly growing \nimportance  of  SMEs,  more  than  80%  have  had  difficulty  accessing  financial  services  and \nsecuring financing.4 SMEs are often less creditworthy than larger companies, usually lacking \nproper accounting and a sound business track record;5 quality assets for collateral; technical, \nmarketing, and managerial skills; and access to markets.6 SMEs also lack market intermediaries \nthat  can  provide  business  support  and  information  services  such  as  accounting,  auditing, \nconsulting,  and  marketing.  Other  types  of  financial  intermediaries  such  as  insurance, \nguarantees, credit information bureaus, and rating agencies have even less SME coverage. \nLack of an adequate bankruptcy law that protects creditors is another factor that makes financial \ninstitutions cautious about lending to SMEs. \n \n3.  The banking services available to SMEs are limited. State-owned commercial banks are \nnot geared to service SMEs, particularly private ones. The other banking institutions7 have \nlimited coverage and financial products8 and depend heavily on collateral.9 The high frequency \nand short-term nature of SME loans, unfamiliar markets and complicated ownership structure, \nand lack of sufficient operational and financial data for loan appraisal have resulted in higher \nbusiness development and administration costs for banks.10 The long process of recognition, \nregistration, and evaluation of collateral presented by SME borrowers cannot meet their frequent \n                                                 \n1  The mission comprised Y. Qian, principal financial economist, and Lu Shen, financial economist of the Governance, \nFinance, and Trade Division of the East and Central Asia Department. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 4 March 2003. \n3  Medium-sized industrial enterprises are those with a maximum of 2,000 employees, CNY400 million assets, and \nCNY300 million sales. Small industrial enterprises are those with a maximum of 300 employees, CNY40 million \nassets, and CNY30 million sales. \n4  According to a survey by the State Information Center. \n5  Over half of SMEs surveyed lacked proper financial management, and over 60% had a credit rating of BBB or \nbelow. Over 80% of bank loans go to AAA- or AA-rated enterprises. \n6  SMEs often produce on a small scale. Over half have only a single product line, and 70% do not have a stable \ncustomer base. \n7  The country has a dozen joint stock commercial banks, 88 city commercial banks, and thousands of rural credit \ncooperatives. \n8  The use of short-term and trade finance tools such as letters of credit,  forfeiting and  factoring, and credit \nrenegotiation and reimbursements, etc. is limited. \n9  More than two thirds of SME loans are collateralized and about 20% guaranteed. \n10 SMEs borrow five times more frequently than large enterprises. However, the average size of an SME loan is only \nabout 5% those for large enterprises, and the administration cost is about five times higher. \n ", "2     \nand seasonal demand. To reduce nonperforming loans (NPLs), many commercial banks have \nadopted a policy of permanently aligning the responsibility of loan performance to the loan \nofficers. This has resulted in acute risk averseness at the subbranch and loan officer level, thus \ncurtailing the amount of loans to SMEs. \n \n4.  To address lack of banking services, many local governments and business communities \nestablished SME credit guarantee companies (CGCs) beginning in the mid-1990s. By June \n2003, the country had 966 guarantee and re-guarantee companies in operation.11 CGCs have \ngained experience in the past few years, particularly in strengthening institutional frameworks \nand developing operational procedures. Some CGCs improved their risk management systems \nand governance structure. More flexible approaches to collateral were adopted by expanding the \nlist of collaterable assets, including mobile assets, production materials, and intangibles. Some \nCGCs provide more value-added services such as market access and managerial training. \nHowever, serious challenges face CGCs and threaten the sustainability of their operations: \n \n(i)  Limited coverage. Despite a large number of CGCs in operation, in aggregate \nthey serve less than 10% of total number of SMEs and meet 1\u20133% of financing \nneeds of SME borrowers.12  \n(ii)  Limited  financial  and  technical  capacity.  Many  CGCs  are  still  quasi-\ngovernmental, with a limited capital base and lacking fund-raising channels.13 \nMost guarantees were for short-term working capital loans of 3\u20136 months, with \nthe  longest  for  1  year.14  Most  CGCs  also  require  counter-guarantees  or \ncollateral.15 \n(iii)  Limited risk management capability. CGCs have difficulties in monitoring loan \ndisbursement and obtaining cash-flow information during the life of the loan, and \nin assessing risks brought by operational uncertainties and moral hazard. In the \ncase of default, CGCs usually lack adequate legal and regulatory protection for \ncollection and foreclosure. Poor risk assessment skills also make it difficult for \nCGCs to properly set guarantee fees.16 \n(iv)  Lack of risk-sharing arrangement with banks. The creditworthiness of CGCs is \nperceived to be low and banks often do not recognize their guarantees. CGCs \nand commercial banks do not effectively cooperate to agree on risk-sharing \nratios,17 multipliers, and means to share information on loan monitoring. \n(v)  Lack of a consistent regulatory system. No explicit regulation or supervisory \nagency  governs  market  entry,  accounting,  prudential  standards,  corporate \n                                                 \n11  Among which 305 were fully funded by the Government, 321 had government contributions, and 340 were purely \ncommercial. In terms of corporate structure, 701 were formed as companies under the Company Law, 181 as \nquasi-government institutions, and the remainder as associations. Re-guarantee companies numbered 67. \n12 Cumulatively, these guarantee companies supported over 48,000 SME borrowers with a total of CNY126.7 billion, \nrepresenting a multiplier of 4.4 times. \n13  Total capital injection in these guarantee companies was CNY26.7 billion, of which the Government supported \nCNY12.2 billion. Cumulatively, slightly over 1,000 cases of payment default were associated with the total loan \namount of CNY680 million, resulting in a net loss of CNY120 million. By the end of 2002, there were a total of 777 \ndefault cases, representing 1.5% of the total number of guarantees and resulting in CNY342 million of defaults. \n14  Ideally guarantee companies should support long-term loans for fixed investment. Most short-term working capital \nloans can support SME sales and orders.  \n15  If comparing the total outstanding amount under guarantees of CNY51 billion with a total capital injection of \nCNY28.7 billion, the multiplier of the guarantee system nationwide is only 1.78, far less than in other developing and \ndeveloped countries. \n16 Government directives indicate that the guarantee fee should be no higher than 50% of the prevailing bank lending \nrate. \n17 Guarantee companies commonly provide 100% of guarantee for principal and interest, and banks become \nprocessing agencies and free rider on risks. Over 60% of banks do not share risks with the guarantee companies. \nThe average guaranteed ratio of SME loans is 93%, higher than in other countries. ", "      3 \ngovernance, operational practices, and financial management of CGCs. The only \nregulation  is  the  Provisional  Rule  on  Risk  Management  for  SME  Financing \nGuarantee Agencies, issued by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) in 2001.18 A plan \nregarding establishment of an SME credit guarantee regulatory committee19 was \nnot implemented due to recent government restructuring. \n(vi)  Lack of risk sharing mechanism through re-guarantees. The existing re-\nguarantee companies have limited business scope and none have developed \nprudent operational procedures and risk management practices. \n \n5.  Despite the challenges and sometimes heated theoretical debates over appropriateness \nusing SME CGCs as means to facilitate SME financing, based on comprehensive analysis and \ninternational comparative studies, the Government is convinced that CGCs can provide a lot of \nvalue added, partly due to market failures such as regulated interest rates, and partly due to \nCGCs closeness to clients to bridge the gap brought by asymmetric information. Institutionally, \nthe SME Department of NDRC is responsible for policymaking for SME development.20 As \nprovided  for  by  the  Law  on  Promoting  Small  and  Medium-Sized  Enterprises,21 the SME \nDepartment has the main responsibilities of enhancing fair competition and healthy development \nof the SME sector, facilitating SME financing, developing international markets, improving the \nSME  support  system,  and  coordinating  with  other  government  agencies  regarding  SME \ndevelopment.  \n \n6.  The  SME  Department  is  contemplating  policy  options  that  could  lead  to  the \nestablishment of a central re-guarantee company, aimed at expanding the service coverage and \nquality  of  SME  guarantee  companies,  streamlining  risk  management,  enhancing \ncreditworthiness and operational efficiency of CGCs, and increasing the overall multiplier for the \nnation\u2019s  guarantee  system.  Given  that  the  credit  guarantee  is  a  hybrid  operation  sharing \nattributes with insurance providers and credit intermediaries, the Government is exploring the \npossibilities of establishing a hybrid SME guarantee regulatory and supervisory framework, \ncomprising a closely coordinated group of central government agencies, including NDRC, MOF, \nChina Banking Regulatory Commission, and China Insurance Regulatory Commission; and local \nself-regulatory organizations, mainly in the form of guarantee associations. \n \n7.  Asian Development Bank\u2019s Operations and Strategy. Developing the private sector \nand SMEs is a strategic objective of ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program. ADB\u2019s operational \nobjectives are to facilitate SMEs\u2019 access to finance and  to promote the development of the \nfinancing and legal infrastructure for SMEs. Through previous TAs, ADB has helped draft the \nSME Promotion Law and policies and regulations for the SME Development Fund based on \n                                                 \n18 The rule has 23 articles. Article 7 requires the guarantee fee to be within 50% of the lending rate, and Article 8 \nstipulates that the guarantee multiplier should be 5\u201310 times against paid-in capital. The rule is made primarily for \nlocal financial bureau-sponsored guarantee companies, and is not applied to private CGCs. \n19 The former State Economic and Trade Commission (SETC) had planned to cooperate with the People\u2019s Bank of \nChina, MOF, local finance bureaus, and local government departments of industry and commerce to establish an \nSME credit regulatory committee. Exact terms of reference for such committee were not established. \n20 The SME Department was established within SETC. An intergovernment leading group on SME development was \nset up in 2000. The major responsibility of the former SETC is to manage state-owned enterprises and regulate \nsectors where they dominate. The Government reorganization in April 2003 abolished SETC and transferred its \nSOE management function to the newly established State Asset Supervision and Administration Commission, and \nthe market regulation function to the newly established Ministry of Commerce. The SME function has been \ntransferred to NDRC, which signified a major reorientation of the Government regarding SME and private sector \ndevelopment and financing policies. \n21 Enacted in June 2002 with ADB assistance and became effective in January 2003. In March 2003, the Government \nissued the Provisional Definition of SMEs. \n ", "4     \ninternational  best  practice.22  ADB  also  helped  the  All-China  Federation  of  Industry  and \nCommerce to identify constraints faced by SMEs and the domestic private sector,23 the output of \nwhich became an essential input into the PRC private sector assessment. ADB disseminated \nthese findings and sought the views of government agencies and market participants on the \ndesign of potential reforms. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n8.  The purpose of the TA is to help the Government formulate strategies and implement \nconcrete programs to facilitate SMEs\u2019 access to finance by expanding the business scope of \nSME CGCs and establishing an effective policy, regulatory, and operational framework for SME \nCGCs. The TA will evaluate the feasibility of, and help establish, the central government re-\nguarantee company, which aims to optimize risk and capital allocations for the SME guarantee \nsystem  nationwide,  support  the  institutional  reform  and  financial  strengthening  efforts,  and \nstrengthen the regulatory and supervisory framework for SME CGCs to ensure their financial \nintegrity. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA will \n \n(i)  help establish and operate the central government re-guarantee company by \n \n(a)  developing a road map and a comprehensive strategy to improve SME \ncredit  guarantee  operations  and  optimize  risk  and  capital  allocation \nthrough re-guarantee operations; and \n(b)  evaluating benefits and risks (including government contingent liabilities), \nand  identifying  operational  modalities  of  the  central  government  re-\nguarantee  company,  recommending  institutional  arrangements, \nformulating operational procedures, and implementing pilot programs of \nre-guarantee  and  co-guarantee  operations  with  selected  guarantee \ncompanies and evaluating the experience learned. \n \n(ii)  support the institutional reforms and financial strengthening efforts of SME CGCs \nby \n \n(a)  developing standardized procedures and templates for various aspects of \nSME  CGC  operations  such  as  financial  controls,  business  plans, \ncorporate governance standards, etc.; and \n(b)  recommending proper standards for accounting and audit that apply to \nguarantee  companies,  for  better  information  disclosure,  financial \nmanagement, risk management, and supervision. \n \n(iii)  recommend measures to improve the regulatory and supervisory framework for \nSME credit guarantee operations and establish procedures for SME guarantee \n                                                 \n22 ADB. 2000.

Cost and Financing \n10.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $790,000 equivalent, comprising $390,000 in \nforeign exchange costs and $400,000 equivalent in local currency costs. It is proposed that ADB \nfinance $550,000 equivalent, consisting of the entire foreign exchange costs, and $160,000 \nequivalent in local costs. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB's TA funding program. \nThe  Government  will  contribute  $240,000  in  kind  for  office  space,  counterpart  staff, \ntransportation, and other services. Details of the cost estimate for the TA are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n11.  The SME Department will be the Executing Agency. A working group will be established \nunder the leadership of director general of the SME Department, to work as the counterpart of \nthe  consultants.  The  SME  Department  of  NDRC  will  provide  the  necessary  office  space, \ncounterpart  staff,  transportation,  and  other  services  to  the  consultants  and  will  arrange \nappointments for the consultants with relevant agencies and organizations. Domestic seminars \nand conferences will be held to bring stakeholders together to discuss TA implementation issues \nand findings. A limited number of senior policymakers from the Government, and financial \nregulators will participate in training in countries with prudent SME re-guarantee operations and \nan effective regulatory framework to identify factors for success and exchange views with foreign \ncounterparts. \n \n12.  The TA is envisaged to require 10 person-months of international consultants (a SME \nfinance and credit guarantee specialist [6 person-months] and a  guarantee regulatory and \nsupervisory specialist [4 person-months]) and 12 person-months of two  domestic consultants \nwith the same expertise [6 person-months each]. A separate budget is provided to engage \nresource persons to participate in seminars and conferences and to cover specific technical \nareas. The terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. The consultants will be selected \nand  engaged  on  an  individual  basis  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  on  the  engagement  of  domestic \nconsultants. Equipment (notebook computers, fax machines, and photocopiers) will be procured \nby the SME Department of NDRC in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. The \nadvance payment facility procedure will be adopted to facilitate timely organization of training, \nseminars, and conference activities. \n \n13.  The consultants will submit (i) inception reports 2 weeks after their services start, (ii) \ninterim progress reports at appropriate stages of TA implementation, (iii) draft final reports before \nthe conclusion of the contract, and (iv) final reports 2 weeks after incorporating the SME \nDepartment of NDRC\u2019s and ADB's comments. All reports have to be submitted in English and \nChinese. The TA will commence in July 2004 and will be completed in June 2005. Workshops \nwill  be  organized  near  the  end  of  the  implementation  period  to  invite  comments  from \ninternational and domestic experts in the field and disseminate the findings of the report.  \n \nIV.

International Consultants (10 person-months) \n1.  Team Leader and Small and Medium-sized Enterprise Finance and Credit \nGuarantee Specialist (6 person-months) \n \n1.  The consultant  will assume the role of the team leader and be responsible for the \noverall management of implementation of the component, timely delivery of good-quality \ninterim  and  final  reports,  and  recruitment  and  management  source  persons  in  various \ntechnical tasks. The Small and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME) finance and credit guarantee \nspecialist, together with other international and domestic consultants, should take the lead in \ntasks related to policy formulation aimed at facilitating SME finance and enhancing the \neffectiveness of the credit guarantee and re-guarantee system. The specialist should possess \ndeep knowledge of and sufficient experience in SME finance and guarantee in the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) and other countries in a similar development stage.
