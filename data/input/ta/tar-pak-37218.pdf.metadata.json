In August 2001, the Government of Pakistan (the Government) devolved 12 services to \nlocal governments as per the local government ordinance. Education and health services were \ndevolved  to  district  governments,  and  water  supply  and  sanitation  to  tehsil  municipal \nadministrations (TMAs). This devolved set-up provides opportunities to improve the substandard \nsocial services, but also poses major challenges given local political priorities, limited capacity, \nand financing constraints.  \n \n2.  The Government of Balochistan has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nprovide  assistance  for  improving  governance,  capacity,  and  financing  of  devolved  social \nservices.  The  country  strategy  and  program  update  (2004\u20132006)1  provides  an  Asian \nDevelopment Fund loan ($47 million) and an ordinary capital resources loan ($23 million) for the \nBalochistan Decentralized Social Services Program (DSSP) in 2005, with a project preparatory \ntechnical assistance (TA) in 2004 to carry out a feasibility study.2 The TA3 work will build on \nlessons from previous and ongoing sector investments that supported the social sectors, in \nparticular the Decentralization Support Program, the Sindh DSSP,  and the public resource \nmanagement programs that are designed to improve governance at macro and micro levels and \nplace devolution on a firm financial footing.4 The TA framework is at Appendix 1. \n \nII.  BACKGROUND \n \n3.  The  socioeconomic  conditions  in  Balochistan\u2019s  rural  communities  remain  extremely \npoor. Half of Balochistan\u2019s people live in poverty, on less than a dollar a day (see also the \nsummery  initial  poverty  and  social  analysis  at  Appendix  2).  They  face  harsh  conditions, \nincluding periodic drought and lack of employment. Among them, especially women lack assets \nand opportunities, have no social safety net, and are bound by practices that affect welfare and \nmake it difficult for them to attend schools and clinics. Despite Government and external efforts \nto keep abreast of population growth (2.4% per year, compared to 1.7% in South Asia), only half \nthe people have access to clean drinking water, half of school age children attend elementary \nschool, and one third of children 12\u201323 months are immunized. However, education and \nemployment of females are increasing. Another positive trend is the increasing capacity of \ncommunities to organize themselves and operate schools and water schemes.  \n \n4.  Devolution is expected to increase community participation in basic social services so as \nto make these services more accountable, effective, and sustainable. Balochistan already has a \nnetwork of schools, health care facilities, and water schemes, which, when properly functioning, \ncould provide major benefits to a large number of poor. However, governance and financing of \nsocial services have been unsatisfactory for decades, and the devolution has brought about \nnew  challenges  of  political  priorities  and  limited  capacity  that  need  to  be  addressed. \nFurthermore, the Balochistan government has set ambitious sector targets in line with the \npoverty reduction strategy and Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Social development, \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2003. ADB Country Strategy Program Update (2004-2006): Pakistan. Manila. \n2   A fact-finding mission was fielded from 22 to 25 March 2004 to reach an agreement with the Government on  the \nobjective, scope, cost estimate, financing, and implementation arrangements of the TA study. \n3   The TA appeared first in ADB Business Opportunity (Internet edition) on 26 February 2004. \n4  ADB.  2002.

Manila. \n ", " 2   \nessential to poverty reduction and economic growth, will require major efforts in the decade \nahead, including the assistance of the private sector.  \n \n5.  Education.  The  major  problem  is  lack  of  quality  of  instruction  due  to  teacher \nabsenteeism, poor facilities, and lack of school supplies. Lack of access is a problem for certain \nremote populations as schools remain closed due to unavailability of teachers. Quality of \neducation is the major factor resulting in low enrolment and high dropout rates. Moreover, lack \nof school infrastructure remains an issue. Expansion of elementary and secondary schools may \nbe required in certain locations to accommodate remote areas and increasing enrolment of \nstudents, especially girls. Special efforts are needed to rationalize resources and to improve the \ninternal efficiency of the education system. To make schools more relevant to the world of work, \nthe Balochistan government is keen to improve technical education, expand the curriculum in \nsecondary schools (including science and English), and introduce vocational streams at the \nmiddle school level. Other major developments are the increasing community involvement in \nschool management and the hiring of location-specific contract teachers, both requiring capacity \nbuilding and training. \n \n6.  Health.  The  past  focus  on  fragmented  interventions  has  resulted  in  a  general \ndeterioration of health services. The Balochistan government wants to reestablish a system \napproach based on the principles of primary health care and integrated priority programs. The \ngovernment has plans for reform initiatives with strong emphasis on autonomy of medical \ninstitutions, public-private partnership (including nongovernment organizations), and community \ninvolvement  through  health  boards.  The  province  is  making  efforts  to  convince  district \ngovernments to focus on improving the quality of services rather than expansion. The health \ndepartment also wants to strengthen its role in policy development, sector regulation, health \nsector monitoring and quality control, and guidance and training of district health staff.  \n  \n7.  Water Supply and Sanitation. Priorities on this subsector are increasing coverage, \nstrengthening  TMAs to plan and develop the services, and mobilizing communities to manage \nsmall-scale water and sanitation schemes on a self-sustaining basis (though full cost recovery \nmay be difficult). The problems in expanding water supply include lack of readily available \ngroundwater  of  adequate  quality,  overextraction,  and  high  operating  costs.  Devolution,  if \ncombined with political commitment and funds, creates opportunities for sector development \nand reform whereby TMAs can begin to take responsibility for planning and implementing \nschemes to achieve wider access to clean water and sanitation. The Balochistan government is \nkeen to improve governance of public water schemes, and work with the private sector, NGOs, \nand communities toward the MDG targets in the sector.  \n \n8.  Crosscutting Features. One striking feature of Balochistan's health, education, water \nand sanitation subsectors is that the basic strategy followed since independence is unsuited to \nthe communities that are resource poor, and live in dispersed, low density settlements. Sector \npolicy has been \"infrastructure driven,\" and the province struggles to meet the recurrent cost \nimplications. There are three implications, especially for women and the poor. First, Balochistan \nhas  numerous  unmaintained  physical  assets,  which  often  become  occupied  for  other, \nunintended  purposes,  while  large  areas  remain  underserved.  Second,  the  province  faces \ndifficulties attracting and retaining, qualified front line workers (teachers, clinic attendants, water \npoint operators, etc). Third, for the most part, the establishment of \"central place\" facilities\u2014 and \nthe capture of most of the development and recurrent budget to do so\u2014puts health, education \nand water beyond the reach of most of the poor. A sector policy will have to actively search for \nalternatives to serve the poor. \n \n ", "      3\nIII.  ISSUES \n \n9.  Alternative Sector Policies. Because of the problems in policies,  policy reforms will \nneed to consider alternate service provision policy strategies, which take into account the vast \ndistances, dispersed population, and needs of the poor. The subsector strategies should bring \nabout alternatives to the heavy infrastructure-driven policy and should identify ways to bring the \nservices to the poor. Moreover, the strategies should include (i) improving cooperation between \nlocal and provincial governments to jointly manage social sector policy reforms, technical \nsupport, and monitoring; (ii) ensuring the efficiency of additional resources and accountability by \nexperimenting, for example, with incentives to mobilize community support; (iii) exploring cost \nrecovery possibilities; (iv) developing public-private partnerships to help finance and manage \nsocial services; (v) building capacity for districts to plan, budget, and deliver improved social \nservices on an equitable basis, especially to rural areas; and (vi) prioritizing programs that help \nto achieve the MDGs. Social sector development depends on leadership capacity at district and \ncommunity  levels,  including  the  relationship  of  nazim  and  district  chief  officers,  and  on \ncompetent staff and funds for operations. Strengthening local government capacity is labor \nintensive and must be continued for many years to come. \n \n10.  To Make Devolution Work. Devolution has fully empowered nazims and councilors to \ntake charge of development at all three levels: district, tehsils, and union councils. However, \nmany local government units (LGUs) lack political commitment and administrative capacity for \nsocial sector development. Decentralization requires provinces to transfer revenues to LGUs in \nthe form of formula-driven block-grants, which are not earmarked for specific uses. LGUs now \ndetermine budgets and expenditures for most services, whereas the policy, standard-setting, \nand monitoring functions remain with the provincial and federal governments. Especially in \nBalochistan, the process of devolution will require support in order to be fully functional due to \ngovernance and service quality constraints and larger distances. In the end, the success of \ndevolution will be measured by the public by improvements made in services. The Balochistan \nDSSP could substantially improve social services by helping improve local governments\u2019 ability \nto plan and manage the social sector, put mechanisms in place to improve social sector \nfinancing and rationalize spending, increase community control over services and staff, and \nsupport provincial line departments with clear roles and better linkages.   \n \n11.  To Involve Civil Society. Under devolution, the aim is for local governments and \ncommunities to take responsibility for social services. District governments and TMAs need to \nbuild links with communities, especially the community citizen\u2019s boards. Over time, the boards \nwill become capable of taking responsibility for service delivery, rather than the government. \nSocial service delivery must be seen as a cooperative venture between all levels of government, \ncommunities, and the private sector, in support of low cost quality services. \n \nIV.  THE  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n12.  The purpose of the TA is to help the Balochistan government identify reforms necessary \nin public social services policy that will have major benefits for the poor in health, education, and \nwater supply and sanitation. The TA will have three outputs: (i) design support mechanisms for \ndevolved social services that will induce local governments and communities to make social \nservices more  effective,  efficient,  equitable,  and  sustainable,  and  serve  as  a  vehicle  for \ncoordination and monitoring; (ii) plan a program loan to establish these support mechanisms \nand the related reform agenda that will help to develop a selection of policies and reforms to be \n ", " 4   \nsupported from loan proceeds, and plan technical support to improve social services based on \nlocal needs; and (iii) prepare a project for capacity building and program support, which is \nclosely coordinated with the activities planned under the Balochistan Resource Management \nProgram.  \n \n13.  The TA will plan a program for Balochistan that targets the poor and is province-wide, \ndemand-driven, and performance-based. All 26 districts in Balochistan will be assisted for an \ninitial period of 3 years, with an emphasis on low cost services that will benefit many people, in \nparticular the poor and women. While the program will be sectorwide, its design will ensure that \nit will only support subsectors and activities not otherwise funded by the government or other \nagencies. The program will allow flexible support according to local priorities but within a broadly \nagreed scope and set of conditions. The TA will also plan for extending into crosscutting areas, \nincluding  gender,  community  participation,  public-private  partnership,  environment,  and \ninstitutional development.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n14.  TA consultants will (i) conduct a thorough analysis of the current situation in light of the \nlocal government ordinance and other government directives, and discuss the findings with \nstakeholders; (ii) recommend social sector reforms that will improve the basic conditions for \nimproving social services under devolution; and (iii) design devolved social services activities to \nhelp local governments improve the quality of social services; build local capacity for service \ndelivery; find ways to create and support public-private partnership; and support improvements \nto make the social sector more efficient, equitable, and sustainable.  \n \n15.  The crosscutting specialists will develop a support structure and policy matrix to improve \ngovernance, capacity, and financing of social services at local government and community \nlevels in close cooperation with the Balochistan Resource Management Program (BRMP). The \nsector specialists will focus on sector-specific interventions and reforms to strengthen social \nservice  delivery.  In  education,  the  program  will  support  school  management  committees, \nschools and stipends for poor students, textbooks, teachers, and curriculum, to improve quality \nof education and enrolment. In health and population welfare, the scope may include support for \nhealth boards to improve facilities, revolving drug funds, and contracting of nurses and female \nhealth visitors to improve the quality of services. In water supply and sanitation, the scope may \ninclude support for (i) village development associations to improve small schemes, (ii) mapping \nand master plans, (iii) sector policies, and (iv) public-private partnership. ADB financing for the \nproposed program may follow one of several design modalities and the consultants will review \nongoing ADB, Government, and other externally funded programs and projects to indicate how \nthe proposed program will complement ongoing efforts.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $530,000 equivalent, of which $194,000 is the \nforeign exchange cost and $336,000 equivalent, the local currency cost. ADB will finance \n$400,000 covering the entire foreign exchange cost of $194,000 and $206,000 equivalent of the \nlocal currency cost.  The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. \nADB will finance consulting services, production of reports, workshops, office equipment, and \nadministration support services. The contribution by the government of Balochistan of $130,000 \nequivalent in kind, will cover support for staff, use of facilities across sectors throughout the \nprovince, communications, and transport as indicated in the financing plan in Appendix 3. The ", "      5\ngovernment  has been advised that approval of  the  TA does  not commit  ADB  to  finance any \nensuing program. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  The Planning and Development Department (PDD), Balochistan, will be the Executing \nAgency for the TA.  A steering committee will be established to provide overall guidance to the \nTA  team.  The  committee,  chaired  by  the  additional  chief  secretary,  PDD,  will  comprise \nrepresentatives from the departments of finance, education, local government, and health and \npopulation  welfare;  four  representatives  from  district  governments  and  TMAs;  and  two \nnongovernment representatives. At least two members will be female. The committee will be \nestablished at the beginning of the TA. It will meet at least once a month to monitor the TA and \nensuring loan processing, so as to establish ownership by the government of Balochistan, \nprovide guidance, and ensure that the design maximizes development impact for the poor.  \n \n18.  The government will appoint a full-time program director before TA signing. The director \nwill  also  attend  the  meetings  of  the  steering  committee.  All  concerned  departments  will \ndesignate counterpart staff to work on a part-time basis with the consultants. PDD will also \nprovide necessary support staff. The government will prepare a document for internal approval \nbefore the TA with ADB signing. The program office will be established in the PDD after TA \nsigning. The office will have utilities, furniture, and local telephone services. The TA will provide \nthree computers, a printer, a facsimile machine, E-mail connection, two mobile phones, rented \ntransport, and furniture as needed. Equipment will be procured in accordance with ADB's \nguidelines for procurement. \n \n19.  The TA will use the services of three international (7 person-months) and four domestic \n(17 person-months) specialists. The domestic experts will include a governance and institutional \ndevelopment specialist and team leader (5 person-months); and a NGO and public-private \npartnership  expert  (4  person-months);  financial  expert,  economist,  and  team  coleader  (5 \nperson-months);  and  gender  and  social  participation  specialist  (3  person-months).  The \ninternational experts will include an education reform specialist (2 person-months), health sector \nreform specialist (3 person-months), and water supply and sanitation expert (2 person-months). \nAll consultants will be recruited on an individual basis, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants  and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB  for the engagement of \ndomestic consultants. Outline terms of reference are in Appendix 4. \n \n20.  The consulting services under the TA will be carried out over a period of 5 months, from \nOctober 2004 to February 2005. The consulting team will submit an inception report within a \nmonth from the start of the TA, a preliminary report of the situation analysis and initial policy \nmatrix within 3 months, the draft final report in the fourth month, and the final report within 5 \nmonths from the start of the TA. The government of Balochistan and ADB will comment on the \ndraft final report. The TA will include field visits, stakeholder mapping, and participatory planning \nto facilitate consensus building among a wide range of stakeholders (such as parents, teachers, \nhealth staff, and political and  administrative leaders at various levels). The consultants will \norganize at least three district workshops and one provincial workshop in Quetta to solicit views \nand discuss options and activities with stakeholders.  \n \nV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Pakistan for preparing the Balochistan Devolved Social Services Program, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \n       \n  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nDesign Summary \nIndicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \nGoal for the resulting       \nloan     \nImproved social sector  Indicators have been  Baseline survey, monitoring \nindicators with special  improved in education,  mechanisms. \nview to Millenium  health and water supply   \nDevelopment Goals will  and sanitation.

To  assist  the  Government  in  achieving  its  human \ndevelopment goals, the project preparatory TA is giving high priority to improving access to social services. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis       Proposed Poverty Classification: CPI \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \n  The incidence of poverty in Pakistan increased from 26.6% in fiscal year (FY) 1993 to 32.2% in FY1999 and \nthe number of poor increased by over 12 million people during this period. Since  FY1999, economic growth has \nslowed further. Development spending has continued to decline, and that the incidence of poverty in Pakistan today is \nsignificantly likely to be higher than in FY1999. Poverty rose more sharply in the rural areas in the 1990s, and in \nFY1999 the incidence of rural poverty (36.3%) was significantly higher than urban poverty (22.6%). Inequality also \nincreased in all four provinces, and FY1999 was clearly the most unequal year in all categories. In FY1997, the \nincome share of the bottom 20% of households had declined to 6.9%, from 7.9% in FY1987, and the income share of \nthe bottom 40% of households declined from 20% to 18%. During the same period, the ratio of the share of the top \nquintile to that of the bottom quintile increased to 6.5% from 5.2% for all areas. \n \n  The socioeconomic conditions in Balochistan remain extremely poor. Half of Balochistan\u2019s people live in \npoverty, on less than $1 a day. They face harsh conditions, including periodic drought and lack of employment. Among \nthem, women lack assets and opportunities, have no social safety net, and are bound by practices that affect welfare \nand make it difficult for them to attend schools and clinics. \n \n  Education is the most important factor that distinguishes the poor from the nonpoor. For example, the \nproportion of literate household heads in poor households is almost half that of nonpoor households. Poor households \non average have 75% more children than the nonpoor households. Most of these children are not receiving any \neducation, and thus the cycle of poverty is perpetuated. There is a strong correlation between household income and \nschool enrollment. \n \n  Health indicators in Pakistan have improved somewhat during over the past decade, although they remain \nlower than indicators in other low-income countries. The infant mortality rate is estimated to have declined from 122 \nper 1,000 live births in FY1991 to 89 per 1,000 live births by FY1999 according to the Pakistan Integrated Household \nSurvey. The infant mortality rate was 93 per  1,000 live births for males and 85 for females, while for urban areas it \naveraged 73 per 1,000 live births as opposed to 95 per 1,000 live births for rural areas.  \n \n  Maternal mortality rates are also very high, at about 340-400 per 100,000 births, largely because over 80% of \ntotal births take place at home, under the care of traditional birth attendants. Less than a third of expectant mothers \ntypically go for prenatal checks, and this rate falls to barely a tenth for postnatal consultations.  \n \n  The total fertility rate, improved somewhat declining from 6.8 births per woman in the mid 1980s to about 5.0 \nbirths per woman by 1997. Once again, most of the reduction appeared to have taken place in urban areas, and has \nbeen largely attributed to an increase in the use of contraceptives. The contraceptive prevalence rate is estimated to \nbe about 29% for urban areas, one of the lowest in Asia.  \n \n  Full  immunization  rates  increased  from  45%  to  49%  based  on  recall  measures;  however,  these  fell \nconsiderably short of the 90% coverage targeted for 1998. Overall, the gender gap in this area was eliminated by \nFY1997, but reappeared in FY1999, when the difference in immunization between males and females was recorded at \n7 percentage points. The rural-urban gap narrowed from 9 to 6 percentage points over this time. The available data \nshow a  strong correlation  between income and immunization,  as approximately 75%  of children in the upper income ", "  Appendix 2  9 \nquintile are fully immunized against only 25% in the bottom quintile.  \n \n  Three  factors\u2014communicable  infectious  diseases,  reproductive  health  problems  and  nutritional \ndeficiencies\u2014account for almost 60% of the burden of disease in Pakistan, when measured in terms of life-years lost. \nAll of these are preventable or easily treatable problems, but the quality of health services is so inadequate that the \nincidence of such diseases remains high, and mortality rates remain high. An estimated 70% of all health facilities are \nin urban areas, and 70% of the national public health budget is spent on the construction and maintenance of hospital \nfacilities, while primary health care is underfinanced. \n \n  Despite Government and external efforts to keep abreast of population growth, only half the people in \nBalochistan have access to clean drinking water, half of school age children attend elementary school, and one third \nof children 12\u201323 months are immunized. However, education and employment of females are increasing. Another \npositive trend is the increasing capacity of communities to organize themselves and operate schools and water \nschemes.  \n \n  Devolution is expected to further increase community participation in basic social services so as to make \nthese services more accountable, effective, and sustainable. \n \nC.
