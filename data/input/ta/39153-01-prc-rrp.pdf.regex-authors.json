An environmental impact assessment was completed and \nAssessment  the summary was circulated to the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) \nBoard of Directors on 4 January 2008. \n   \nProject Description  The  Chongqing\u2013Lichuan  Railway  (CLR)  Development  Project  is  a \npriority project included in the Eleventh Five-Year Plan (11FYP) of the \nGovernment of the PRC (Government). The Project is located in the \ncentral  part  of  Chongqing  municipality  and  the  northwestern  part  of \nHubei  province,  a  relatively  poor  area,  and  is  designed  to  promote \nsustainable economic growth by constructing 259 kilometers (km) of \nrailway line from Chongqing to Lichuan in Hubei province. The Project \nwill  (i)  develop  an  efficient,  safe,  affordable,  and  environmentally \nsustainable railway transport system in the region; and (ii) help create \nmore employment and income-generating opportunities, thus benefiting \npoor residents.  \n   \nRationale  The Project reflects ADB\u2019s railway sector operational strategy for the \nPRC, which includes reducing railway network constraints to promote \nsustainable economic growth in poor areas not served by railways. The \ncomponents have been formulated in line with the Ministry of Railway\u2019s \n(MOR\u2019s) 2004 railway development plan and its 11FYP (2006\u20132010). \n \nCLR is in line with the Government\u2019s western development strategy to \nprovide  less-developed  regions  with  better  infrastructure  to  facilitate \neconomic growth, thereby giving people more opportunities to improve \ntheir living standards. The interior regions of the PRC have not benefited \nas much from economic growth and reforms as the east coast; in fact, \nthe  gap  between  economic  and  social  development  has  increased. \nTransport  constraints  and  high  logistics  costs  are  two  factors \ncontributing to regional economic disparities, and two of the constraints \npreventing  the  western  region  from  capitalizing  on  its  comparative \nadvantages. \n \nCLR  is  part  of  the  shortest  east\u2013west  corridor  linking  Shanghai, \nQingdao, Wuhan, Yichang, and other major cities and ports in the east \nto Chongqing and Chengdu in the west. The proposed alignment for the \nCLR is 369 km shorter than the existing route between Shanghai and \nChengdu. Traversing Hubei province, and Chongqing municipality, the \nproposed  railway  line  will  connect  with  Shanghai\u2013Wuhan\u2013Yichang\u2013\nLichuan  in  the  east,  Chongqing\u2013Huaihua  railway  in  the  center,  the \nproposed Lanzhou\u2013Chongqing and Xi\u2019an\u2013Chongqing main lines in the \nnorth, Chongqing\u2013Chengdu in the west. \n ", "ii   \nCLR,  a  joint-venture  railway  between  the  MOR  and  the  Chongqing \nmunicipal government, will have substantial managerial and financial \nautonomy. The Project will help change railway enterprises from cost \ncenters  in  a  planned  economy  to  profit  centers  in  an  increasingly \ncompetitive transport market.  \n   \nImpact and  The Project will help increase standards of living and reduce poverty in \nOutcome  the  project  area  by  removing  a  transport  constraint  on  sustainable \neconomic growth, and improve safety and reliability by introducing new \nand modern technology. This will be achieved through the provision of \nefficient,  affordable,  environment-friendly,  and  energy-efficient  railway \ntransportation in unserved, less developed areas, creating the conditions \nnecessary for developing local resources and generating employment \nand income-enhancing opportunities. \n \nProject preparation was participatory. Extensive consultations were held \nwith  all  the  main  stakeholders\u2014various  affected  people,  potential \nbeneficiaries,  village  leaders,  women\u2019s  groups,  local  ethnic  minority \nbureaus, and local governments in the project area. Household surveys \nwere carried out and participatory workshops were organized in the \nproject area to elicit and gain an understanding of public opinion about \nthe  Project  and  provide  inputs  to  the  social  and  environmental \nassessments. \n \nThe Project comprises (i) the construction of 259 km of double-track, \nelectrified, standard-gauge Class I railway from Chongqing to Lichuan; \n(ii) the construction of eight new railway stations complete with facilities; \n(iii) safety initiatives, including the provision of modern technology and \nequipment  for  enhancing  safety;  (iv)  the  provision  of  signaling, \ncommunication, and management information systems; (v) training in \nthe use and maintenance of modern equipment; (vi) consulting services \nfor construction supervision, monitoring and evaluation, and marketing \nand business development; and (vii) institutional strengthening. The key \ninputs needed for project implementation are civil works, equipment, \nconsultants, and MOR and project company staff. \n   \nProject Investment  The total cost of the Project is $3,071.11 million.  \nPlan \n   \nFinancing Plan  A loan of $150 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will be \nprovided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based \nlending facility. The loan will have a term of 26 years including a grace \nperiod  of  6 years,  an  interest  rate  determined  according  to  ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15%, and other \nterms and conditions set forth in the Loan Agreement. \n   \nPeriod of  Until 30 June 2015 \nUtilization   \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2014 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  MOR \n ", "  iii \nImplementation  The Project will be implemented over 6 years. The Foreign Capital and \nArrangements  Technical Import Center (FCTIC), under MOR, will coordinate the tasks \nof the project management office and be responsible for procurement, \nwithdrawals, and reporting to ADB. The project company will construct, \nmanage, and operate the CLR, and develop and implement adequate \nand  transparent  business  development  mechanisms,  and  accounting \nand reporting systems.  \n   \nProcurement  MOR  will  procure  ADB-financed  components  according  to  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nContracts  for  goods  valued  at  $1  million  or  more  will  be  procured \nthrough international competitive bidding (ICB). Contracts valued at less \nthan $1 million will be procured through national competitive bidding \n(NCB), according to the PRC Tendering and Bidding Law (1999) and \nsubject to clarifications agreed on with ADB. Packages valued below \n$100,000, procurement will follow the shopping procedure.  \n   \nConsulting  The ADB loan will finance 8 person-months of international consulting \nServices  services  to  strengthen  the  institutional,  marketing,  and  business \ndevelopment  functions  of  the  project  company.  Consultants  will  be \nrecruited through quality- and cost-based selection (80% technical and \n20% financial) and simplified technical proposal, according to ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). MOR will hire and finance the services of national consultants for \nproject  design,  construction  supervision,  construction  quality  control, \nenvironmental supervision, procurement, and monitoring and evaluation \nof  the  safeguard  aspects  of  the  Project  according  to  government \nprocedures acceptable to ADB. \n \nProject Benefits  The Project will (i) provide the shortest land route between Lichuan, \nand Beneficiaries  Fuling, and Chongqing\u2014key economic centers of Chongqing and Hubei \nprovince\u2014and enable railway users to benefit from lower transport costs \nand shorter travel distances and times; (ii) improve the environment and \nreduce  pollution;  (iii) enhance  railway  safety;  (iv)  reduce  fuel \nconsumption and enhance energy efficiency, enabling the PRC to save \nvaluable  foreign  exchange;  (v)  increase  the  corridor\u2019s  capacity, \nbenefiting consumers and producers of goods and services through the \nprovision of timely and efficient transport services and lower logistics \ncosts;  (vi) generate  direct  and  indirect  employment  in  the  project \ninfluence area, and create jobs and income-earning opportunities (many \nlocal unskilled laborers will be hired for the construction and operation of \nthe railway); (vii) provide access to broader markets to an area that now \nlacks adequate cost-efficient transportation services; and (viii) stimulate \nlocal development through small-business opportunities, tourism, railway \nstation  area  development,  and  other  infrastructure  elements,  to \nmaximize benefits to local areas. \n \nThe major project beneficiaries will be (i) the Government, which will \nbenefit  from  the  reduced  energy  bill  and  improved  safety; \n(ii) passengers,  including  tourists,  who  will  benefit  from  affordable, \nfaster,  and  safer  trips;  (iii) freight  users,  who  will  benefit  from  more \naffordable, faster, and safer trips when they switch from the existing \nroad;  (iv) local  residents,  who  will  benefit  from  the  lower  prices  of \n ", "iv   \ncommodities and services transported by the project railway; (v) local \nlabor involved in construction work and the supply of materials during \nimplementation, and loading/unloading during the railway\u2019s operation; \n(vi) local farmers, who will be able to sell their products at market prices \nwithout  paying  a  high  margin  to  a  transport  intermediary; \n(vii) manufacturers and traders, who can increase production capacity or \nestablish businesses, and will transport their goods and services by the \nrailway;  and  (viii) local  governments,  which  will  benefit  from  the \nincreased  opportunity  for  local  area  development  and  increased \nrevenues. \n \nThe Project will benefit about 5.5 million people living in the project area. \nThe poverty and social assessment looked at seven counties or districts. \nTwo counties are designated national or provincial poverty counties. \nThere are 681 poverty villages and about 590,000 people are poor. \nAbout 65% of the beneficiaries live in rural areas, and 16.4% are poor, \nwith an annual net income per capita of less than CNY900. The links \nbetween poverty, difficult topography, and poor transport systems are \napparent in the project area for the proposed CLR. Poverty is often \ncaused  by  geographic  remoteness  and  isolation,  limited  transport \naccess, high transport costs, and poor access to market information, as \nwell as limited access to health, education, and other social services. \n \nThe  Project  will  facilitate  the  creation  of  additional  employment  and \nincome-generating opportunities. About 119,000 person-years of work \nwill be created during construction. This will provide direct employment \nopportunities to over 59,500 poor people, including women and ethnic \nminorities. Railway station area development will increase incomes in \nlocal communities and help generate local revenues. The Project will \nfacilitate  the  development  of  small  businesses,  local  industry,  and \ntourism, and thus help generate additional opportunities in the future for \nlocal  people.  Consultations  with  local  people  in  the  project  area \nindicated their strong support for the Project. \n \nThe  Project  is  financially  and  economically  sustainable.  The  5.48% \nfinancial internal rate of return exceeds the 2.80% weighted average \ncost of capital. The economic internal rate of return is estimated at \n16.7%.  \n \nThe increased tax revenues generated by the economic development \ninduced by the Project will help finance improved social service facilities \nand basic infrastructure. \n   \nRisks and  The  railway  will  be  constructed  in  mountainous  and  difficult  terrain, \nAssumptions  which  presents  a  significant  technical  challenge.  The  associated \n  physical risks during implementation include delays, cost overruns, risks \nto worker health and safety, and environmental impact. These potential \nrisks have been assessed and mitigating measures based on lessons \nlearned from other railroad projects in the PRC have been provided.  \n \nResettlement  will  cause  the  relocation  of  about  5,314  people.  The \nrailway  alignment  was  selected  to  minimize  resettlement,  where \npossible.  The  resettlement  plan  includes  preferential  treatment  for \n ", "  v \nemployment during construction, supply of local materials, allocation of \ncommercial space near railway stations, and job training. Resettlement \nwill be implemented by local governments and closely monitored and \nsupervised.  These  measures  will  mitigate  the  potential  social  risks \nassociated with resettlement. \n \nIntermodal competition between railways and roads will create market \nrisks  for  the  project  railway.  However,  the  existing  road  is  already \ncongested and the capacity constraint is expected to worsen. Surveys of \npassengers  and  freight  shippers  found  that  the  railway  would  have \nseveral advantages over other transport modes: lower fares, shorter \ntravel  times,  safety,  and  punctuality.  The  increasing  commercial \norientation of the joint-venture railway will help to lessen the risks posed \nby intermodal competition. \n ", "100 o 00'E M O N G O L I A 120 o 00'E\nCHONGQING--LICHUAN  INNER   MONGOLIA\nRAILWAY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT\nIN THE Jining\nHEBEI\nPEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA Baotou\nHohhot\nto Urumqi DHounagnsgh Heneg(Yellow River)Datong BEIJING Qinhuangdao\nTIANJIN\nShuoxian\nYumen Yinchuan Shenmu North Bazhou Tianjin BSoehaai\nHuanghua\nSHENMU--YAN'AN RAILWAY Yuanping Shijiazhuang\nYulin Taiyuan\nZhongwei Hengshui Yantai\nYuci Dezhou\nGantang Suide\nNINGXIA Mucun SHANXI Shehe Jinan\nSHANDONG\nXining TAIYUAN--ZHONGWEI RAILWAY Xiaoyi Tunilu Fengteng JING--JIU RAILWAY Qingdao 35 o 00'N\nQINGHAI Lanzhou\nYan\u2019an North\n35 o 00'N SHANXI--XIAOLIU RAILWAY Hancheng YuLeinshfeannJiaozuoXin Xiang Heze YanLzihnoyui ShijiuYsueollow  Sea\nZhongjiacun TongguanHouma Zhengzhou Xuzhou Lianyungang\nGANSU Baoji Xinfeng HENAN Shangqiu XinyiJIANGSU\nXi'an Qingling Tunnel\nHEFEI--XI'AN RAILWAY ZHENGZHOU--XI'AN RAILWAY Huaiyuan\nLANZHOU--CHSOINCGHQUINAGN RAILWAY YangDpianxgiagSnuaHnAAADnNAkaXXnIIAgND-a-SWnhAjaiaNnGnXgugInAckaNhon euRXnAgiIaLnWTogAnfYXgabinxaii a MLNHoisuaUnhntaaByXinnaEisanHIogluinaXningycahFnuugaynDaManbiaeg  c MhoeunLtnaHuign'seafnei CBhWaennugghfbueungNYaiHxnijaninngganYaWJnigauSpnxHiigNnSyAgaihnnNatoGnngHghAaiI\nWanzhou (Wanxian) Jingmen ANHUI Changxing\nCHONGQING-C-LhICeHnUgAdNu RAILWAY CHONGQING Lichua(nYangtze RiverY)ichang HWaunhkaonu HEFAEIn--qJiInUgJIANG RAILWAY HNainnggbzohou\nNeijiang ChongFquilningg Huaiyuan YICHANG--WANZHOU RAILWAY Jiujiang ZHEJIANG\nScenic Area\nNanchang\nYibin\nDALI--LIJIANG RAILWAY CHONGQING--GUIYANG RAILWAY Changsha Xiangtang Yiyang Wenzhou\nZhongdian Chang  Jiang Loudi Sanjiangcheng Yingtan\nLijiang GUIZHOU--SHUIBAI RAILWAY GUIZHOU Huaihua HUNAZhNuzhou Ji'an JIANGXI FUJIAN\nLanping\nDukuo Liupanshui Henyang Nanping 25 o 00'N\nFuzhou\nZhanyi BaiguGouiyang Guiding Ganzhou GANZHOU--LONGYAN RAILWAY\nDali Hongguo Pingzha\n2B5 oa 0o0s'hNan Chuxiong KunmiQnugjing Weishe LuochenGguilin Dingnan Longyan Xiamen\nYUNNAN Yiliang Hechi GUANGXI Meizhou Zhangzhou\nSancha Longchuan\nLincang Liuzhou GUANGDONG\nKaiyuan Heshan Laibin Chaozhou\nShiping Guangzhou\nMohei Litang Sanshui Shantou\nNANNING--KUNMING RAILWAY Nanning Yunfu YaCoghuangping Shenzhen GUANG--MEI--SHANR AILWAY\nJinghong Ping XiangFangQchineznhgou Hepu Hechun ZMhauMchaaAuiCAU SKAHoROwNloGo nKONG SAR\nVIET NAM Beihai Zhakou Maoming National Capital\nLAO PEOPLE'S Zhanjiang YAOGU--MAOMING RAILWAY Provincial Capital\nDEMOCRATIC\nREPUBLIC GTounlfk  ionf Yangpu Santang CExitiys/tTinogw Rnailway\nHaikou\nNada Planned Railway\nChahe\nShilu Planned ADB--Financed Railway\nBasou HAINAN\nADB--Financed Railway Projects\nSanya\nN Completed\nUnder Construction\nProposed Project Railway\nSouth   China   Sea\n0 50 100150200250 River\nProvincial Boundary\nKilometers International Boundary\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n100 o 00'E 120 o 00'E\n08-4680 HR", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  for  the  Chongqing\u2013Lichuan  Railway  (CLR) \nDevelopment Project. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  From 1978, when market-oriented economic reforms were introduced, to 2007, the PRC \nexperienced  sustained  rapid  economic  growth,  which  resulted  in  a  correspondingly  rapid \nincrease in demand for transportation. Passenger transport grew by 9% yearly and freight \ntransport by 7.6%. The railway is the principal mode of freight transport in the PRC. In 2006, the \nmodal split for freight ton-kilometers (km) was 47.5% for railways, 27.9% for inland waterways \nand sea-to-shore shipping, 21.1% for roads, 3.3% for pipelines, and 0.2% for civil aviation. That \nsame year, road traffic accounted for 52.8% of total passenger-kilometers, railways for 34.5%, \ncivil aviation for 12.3%, and coastal and inland waterways for 0.4%.  \n \n3.  The railway is the primary mode of transport for long-distance and bulk transport. At the \nend of 2007, the PRC\u2019s railway system of 78,000 km comprised 63,600 km of national railways \nand 14,400 km of joint-venture and local railways. The Ministry of Railways (MOR) operates the \nstate-owned national railway as an integrated system. The joint-venture and local railways, \ncomprising regional lines within provincial boundaries, are constructed under the sponsorship of \nprovincial governments or MOR to serve local needs and provide interconnection to the national \nrailway network. The railway network, despite its large size, does not adequately cover the \ncountry\u2019s population and land area.1 \n \n4.  PRC\u2019s  railways  have  the  highest  freight  transport  density  in  the  world  and  the \nsecond-highest passenger transport density after Japan\u2019s. Locomotive turnover is the highest in \nthe world. From 1978 to 2007, railway freight increased yearly by 5.28%, from 535 billion ton-km \nto  2,380 billion ton-km,  and  passenger  traffic  by  6.74%,  from  109 billion  passenger-km  to \n722 billion passenger-km. For passenger trips, the average railway journey increased from 134 \nkm in 1978 to 532 km in 2007; in comparison, the average road journey lengthened from 35 km \nto 55 km over the same period. For freight, the average journey in 2007 was 757 km for railway \nand 65 km for road. Despite such growth rates, railway capacity has lagged behind demand \nbecause of system constraints (Appendix 2). Given the railways\u2019 important role in providing \neconomic  transportation,  these  constraints,  if not  removed,  will  continue  to  thwart  efficient \neconomic growth. The Government\u2019s aggressive plan for improving railways includes network \nexpansion and construction in underserved areas. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Government Strategy \n \n5.  The railway development policy of the Government of the PRC (Government) is directed \nat (i) removing constraints and expanding the system, (ii) encouraging the construction of joint-\nventure  local  railways  to  promote  the  development  of  local  economies,  (iii)  improving  the \nefficiency and safety of the existing system by using new technology and modern management \n                                                 \n1  The network density per 1,000 square km of land is one-third that of India and one-tenth that of Japan. \n ", "2 \ntools in planning and operation, (iv) reducing operating subsidies through appropriate pricing \nand commercialization of services, (v) initiating institutional and structural reforms to increase \nautonomy and accountability, and (vi) encouraging nongovernment investment in infrastructure \nand related services.  \n \n6.  In 2004, the State Council approved a new railway development plan for the period up to \n2020. The plan seeks to expand the railway network to 100,000 km. Increasing train speed is a \nmajor goal. Priority will be given to developing railways in unserved areas and regions that now \nlack transport and are still less developed. The route network length will increase by 16,000 km \nin the western region of the PRC, to reach a network length of 40,000 km by 2020. To improve \noperational efficiency, MOR has begun separating passenger and freight trains on key rail \ncorridors.2  \n \n7.  The Eleventh Five-Year Plan (11FYP) (2006\u20132010) continues to emphasize railway \ndevelopment,  and  seeks  to  speed  up  railway  construction.  The  plan  envisages  (i)  the \nconstruction of 17,000 km of new lines, and (ii) the double-tracking and electrification of 45% of \nthe network length. The plan seeks to (i) build a dedicated passenger railway network through \nthe construction of 7,000 km of passenger dedicated lines by 2010; (ii) develop coal transport \ncorridors by increasing the capacity of the existing lines; (iii) expand the railway network in the \npoor western region (to 34,000 km); (iv) build international corridors at the southwest and \nnorthwest  borders;  and  (v)  develop  a  nationwide  intermodal  container  network.  A  total \ninvestment of CNY1.5 trillion\u2014CNY1.25 trillion for construction and CNY250 billion for rolling \nstock\u2014is planned in the 11FYP, of which a total of CNY465.2 billion has been spent in 2006 \nand 2007 (Appendix 3). \n \n2.  Asian Development Bank Strategy and Sector Experience \n \n8.  The strategy of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for the railway sector involves \nhelping (i) expand the railway system by constructing new lines in unserved, less-developed \nareas; (ii) modernize railways, enhance safety, and increase the capacity to improve efficiency \non key routes of the national railway system; (iii) commercialize railway operations to sustain \nefficient operations; (iv) promote energy conservation and environmental sustainability; and \n(v) increase railway competitiveness in the transport sector through restructuring and reform. At \nthe heart of the strategy is the development of railways in poor, less-developed inland provinces \nto promote sustainable economic growth and reduce poverty.3 ADB has provided 15 loans \ntotaling over $3.0 billion to finance the construction of about 1,921 km of eight provincial \nrailways operated by joint ventures with MOR, and 5,541 km of new railway lines under six \nnational railway projects, and a sector-wide intervention to improve safety on the PRC railway \nnetwork. ADB assistance to the sector has evolved from financing civil works on local railways \nto supporting major national corridors with much less financing but with safety, management \ninformation system, environmental, and other technological improvements (Appendix 4). The \nProject,  designed  to  promote  economic  growth  by  providing  safe  and  reliable  railway \ntransportation  in  unserved,  less-developed,  and  poor  areas  of  Chongqing  municipality  and \nHubei province, is consistent with the PRC\u2019s development priorities and the ADB strategy. \n                                                 \n2  ADB  is  financing  the  first  passenger-dedicated  corridor  under  another  loan.

Manila (Loan 2182-PRC for $400 million, approved on 22 September).  \n3  ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Assessing the Impact of Transport and \nEnergy Infrastructure on Poverty Reduction. Manila. The conclusion was that completed railway projects supported \ngeneral economic growth in the region and led to small areas of high economic growth in towns served by railway \nstations. \n ", "  3 \n9.  Policy Dialogue. Policy dialogue has been a feature of ADB\u2019s assistance to the railway \nsector and has effectively complemented the lending operations. Since 1989, 14 technical \nassistance (TA) initiatives totaling $6.6 million have been provided for institutional development \nfor dedicated passenger lines and local railways, tariff and organizational studies for the Jing\u2013\nJiu railway, enhancement of commercial and business operations, marketing and business \ndevelopment, human resource development, and improvement of financial management and \naccounting systems. ADB\u2019s policy dialogue with MOR is centered on (i) poverty reduction as the \noverarching  objective  of  ADB  operations,  (ii)  full  compliance  with  ADB  safeguard  policies, \n(iii) energy conservation and environmental sustainability, (iv) railway safety, (v) sector reforms, \n(vi) marketing and business development, (vii) private sector participation and nongovernment \nfinancing, and (viii) regional cooperation. The railway development plan defines the major goals \nfor the PRC railways up to 2020, and is in broad agreement with ADB\u2019s strategic agenda. \nMOR\u2019s  proposed  reform  agenda  for  this  plan  seeks  to  (i)  study  and  learn  from  the  best \ninternational  practices  worldwide,  (ii)  separate  core  operations  from  noncore  transportation \nbusinesses, (iii) rationalize and reduce staff, (iv) reform the railway investment and financing \nsystem, and (v) establish specialized transportation companies. \n \n10.  MOR  is  taking  a  structured  approach  to  railway  reform.  In  1999,  using  a  new \nmanagement  concept\u2014the  asset  operating  liability  system\u2014it  entered  into  management \ncontracts with railway administrations to improve profitability (as a pilot project). The contracts \nhelped  improve  operational  and  financial  performance;  this  approach  was  subsequently \nextended to all railway administrations. The separation of core and noncore businesses is a key \nelement  of  MOR\u2019s  restructuring  program.  The  total  number  of  employees  in  the  core \ntransportation business was reduced from 1.89 million in 1997 to 1.41 million in 2006. In the \nnoncore  transportation business,  five  large  companies  employing  616,500  staff  have  been \ndivested.  To  provide  jobs  for  redundant  staff,  by  the  end  of  2006  MOR  had  set  up \n3,625 diversified businesses (independent of the core transportation business) employing more \nthan 321,544 staff to supply equipment, goods, and services to the railway industry. In 1998, \nMOR initiated a cost-sharing scheme for health insurance and pensions for railway employees. \nIn 2005, it completed the transfer of 822 primary and middle schools, 46 vocational schools, and \n181 nursery schools, and 260 hospitals and medical units to local governments. One hundred \nbranch lines comprising 7,800 km were separated to improve productivity and reduce operating \nlosses. (The reform agenda matrix is in Appendix 5. Supplementary Appendix A contains a \nchronology of railway reforms.) \n \n11.  Poverty Reduction. The strategic purpose of ADB\u2019s involvement in the railway sector is \nto create the conditions for sustainable economic growth to help improve living standards. The \nProject, located in an unserved area, has the potential for economic growth, once improved, \ncost-effective transport access is provided. Identifying ways of enhancing the poverty reduction \nimpact has been an integral part of project planning and design. Specific features include \n(i) providing employment during construction and operation of the CLR on a preferential basis to \npoor workers, including women;4 (ii) using locally produced materials (e.g., sand, stone, cement) \nthat  meet  the  requirements  of  quality  and  economy;  (iii) providing  for  railway  station  area \ndevelopment;  (iv)  providing  station  access  roads  and  construction  access  roads;  and\n                                                 \n4  In the Guizhou\u2013Shuibai Railway Project, the proportion of the poor in unskilled labor was 41% on the average and \n64% during peak construction. (ADB. 1998. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors \non a Proposed Loan to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Guizhou\u2013Shuibai Railway Project. Manila.)  \n ", "4 \n(v) supporting the poverty reduction programs of local governments.5 The Project will finance \nconstruction access roads to be handed over to the local villages after the construction. Local \ngovernments have a 5-year plan for improving the road network and transport services in the \nproject area concurrently with the Project. These roads will reach all of the province-designated \npoverty villages. The Project and the local road development will increase the welfare gains for \nthe poor, including women, and help spread project benefits to the poverty villages.  \n \n12.  Energy Conservation and Environmental Sustainability. Since 2006, an important \nelement of ADB\u2019s policy dialogue with MOR has been the enhancement of energy conservation \nand  environmental  sustainability.  The  11FYP  also  identifies  energy  conservation  and \nenvironmental sustainability as the two important areas of sustainable development and seeks \nplans and actions to achieve this. The ADB dialogue emphasizes the need to create awareness \nof  these  two  issues  through  such  means  as  including  energy  savings  and  environmental \nimprovements, among other factors, in the performance evaluation of railway administrations \nand  other  entities.  The  dialogue  encourages  the  use  of  energy-efficient  technologies  and \nenvironmental improvements in railway construction, operation, and maintenance. ADB will \nassist MOR in drawing up a strategy for making the PRC railways more energy-efficient.6 Fuel-\nefficient  locomotives,  double-stack  container  trains,  \u201cgreen  corridors,\u201d  environment-friendly \nwaste  disposal  and  station  design,  and  fuel-efficient,  environment-friendly  maintenance \nequipment are part of the project design. This area is of mutual interest to other development \npartners like the Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD), Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau \n(KfW), and the World Bank, and ADB has maintained close coordination with them. \n \n13.  Enhancing Safety. Safety is an integral part of a competitive, high-quality, and reliable \ntransportation system for people and goods. As PRC railways have modernized, introduced new \nconcepts and technologies, and increased speeds, the safety needs have changed. MOR\u2019s \n11FYP recognizes this important aspect and seeks to attract foreign technology and know-how \nto meet these needs. ADB, for its part, emphasizes in its policy dialogue with MOR the need for \noperational  reforms  for  the  rail  network,  including  safety  improvements  in  construction, \noperation, and maintenance. MOR and ADB support the objective of safety and security on \nPRC railways through the introduction of modern technologies, policy development, legislation, \nmonitoring  and  enforcement,  and  outreach  activities  (Appendix  6).  Since  2003,  ADB  has \nsupported investments in railway safety as part of ADB financing. ADB has initiated dialogue on \nadopting a sector-wide approach, rather than a project-based approach, to safety. A sector-wide \napproach is consistent with the network approach adopted for train operations in the PRC and \nhelps in providing economies of scale, and better management of emergencies, preventive \nmaintenance,  and  accidents.  ADB  has  worked  closely  with  the  safety  and  transportation \ndepartments of MOR to develop a comprehensive plan for the institutional, investment, and \ntraining needs for safety in PRC railways and is providing a TA grant of $500,000 to help in \ndeveloping an emergency management system.7 In 2007, ADB approved a $100 million loan for \nenhancing safety on the PRC railway network.8  \n                                                 \n5  After some completed projects it was reported that about 40% of the poor at appraisal had been raised above the \npoverty line. In the case of the Hefei\u2013Jiujiang Railway Project, 41% of the poor were raised above the poverty line. \n(ADB. 1993.

Sector  Reforms. ADB is supporting the institutional reform of the railway sector to \nseparate government and enterprise functions, giving full play to market forces and increasing \nthe competitiveness of the railways. ADB has actively pursued (i) the separation of the core \ntransport business from the noncore transport business, (ii) the segmentation of passenger and \nfreight services, and (iii) the strengthening of the recently corporatized specialized transportation \ncompanies.  As  part  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  dialogue  with  MOR,  three  large  companies  handling \ncontainers,  special  goods,  and  express  parcel  have  been  set  up. 9  The  setting  up  of \npassenger-dedicated corridors with a separate institutional structure is a key ADB intervention.10 \nADB is assisting in the development of the institutional, marketing, business development, and \ntechnical standards for such initiatives.11  \n \n15.  Rationalization of staff and reduction of transportation and non-transportation staff is \nalso being pursued. On 18 March 2005, under a major restructuring exercise, MOR abolished \n41 subrailway administration bureaus, thereby removing one tier of railway management. By the \nend of 2006, the number of stations and sections had been reduced from 1,500 to 695. In the \nprocess, the staff was reduced by 22,000, operations were rationalized, productivity improved, \nand efficiency increased. Recent ADB interventions have supported operational reforms and \nemphasized railway safety, including the introduction of safe and reliable technology, faster \nspeeds,  dedicated  passenger  and  freight  lines,  a  modern  dispatch  control  system,  and \nhigh-quality information systems on the PRC railway network. The PRC\u2019s accession to the \nWorld Trade Organization has intensified competition among different modes of transport, and \nthe structure of transport demand is likely to change.12 An ADB advisory TA for policy reform \nsupport to MOR13 analyzed (i) the conflicting roles of meeting social obligations and making \nprofits, (ii) increasing modal competition, (iii) the impact of fast urbanization and economic \ndevelopment, and (iv) demand for better services. As a lead development partner in the sector, \nADB maintains close coordination with AFD, KfW, and the World Bank; and has developed with \nthese institutions a common approach to reforms and assistance (Appendix 3).  \n \n16.  Marketing and Business Development. As the PRC progresses to a market-driven \neconomy, the railways will need to compete on the basis of price and service quality for \ndemand-based transportation services. New marketing and business development initiatives are \nneeded  for  both  freight  and  passenger  services  to  be  competitive.  In  past  projects,  ADB \nsupported project-specific studies to create marketing and business development opportunities, \nincluding  skills  and  knowledge  needed  for  market-oriented  operation,  and  awareness  of \nprofitable operations. The Project will continue these initiatives through a capacity development \nprogram for the project company. \n \n                                                 \n9  These companies are the China Railway Container Transport Company, the China Railway Express Parcel \nCompany, and the China Railway Special Goods Company. The start-up process is ongoing. ADB and MOR have \nagreed on the separation of container businesses as part of the ADB-financed Yichang\u2013Wanzhou Railway Project. \n(ADB. 2003. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China for the Yichang\u2013Wanzhou Railway Project. Manila.) \n10 ADB is financing the main east\u2013west passenger-dedicated corridor. (ADB. 2005.

Private  Sector  Participation.  ADB\u2019s  policy  dialogue  encourages  increased  private \nsector  participation  in  the  railway  sector.  ADB  is  assisting  MOR  with  a  study  to  examine \nopportunities for diversified financing sources, increased private sector involvement, and the \npossibility of public\u2013private partnerships in the PRC railways sector. In 2005 and 2006, the \nState Council and MOR issued guidelines to facilitate reforms in the investment and financing \nsystem, which seek to reduce the threshold of the investment, encourage the private sector to \ninvest, and welcome strategic investors in railway financing.14 Strategic and private investors15 \nare participating in the project equity of the ADB-financed Taiyuan\u2013Zhongwei Railway Project \n(2006). In 2006, initial public offerings for Guangshen Railway Company16 and Daqin Railway \nCompany were made, and were heavily oversubscribed. In 2007, the China Railway Tielong \nContainer  Logistics  Company  made  an  additional  public  offering  of  80  million  shares  for \nCNY700 million. \n \n18.  Under the Project, Chongqing province is exploring the possibility of diversified financing \nsources for CLR, including the private sector. A corporate entity has been set up to construct, \noperate, and manage CLR. Activities such as consulting services for construction supervision, \ntesting,  construction  contracts,  track  maintenance,  commercial  activities,  industrial  sidings, \nloading  and  unloading,  and  other  logistical  facilities  will  be  outsourced  through  open \ncompetition, and private sector involvement will be encouraged in the development of station \nfacilities, local tourism, and real estate. Extra-large container terminals will be established at \nChongqing and Wuhan to facilitate the participation of shipping lines and freight forwarders in \nthe business of rail-transported containers. All of these actions will enhance opportunities for \nprivate sector participation. \n \n  3.  Lessons  \n \n19.  The evaluation17 of ADB\u2019s assistance for the transport sector in the PRC concluded that \nADB\u2019s program for railways is successful and that its strategic priorities for the subsector\u2014 \ncentered on building railways with modern technologies\u2014are well-aligned with the PRC\u2019s needs \nto increase railway capacity and reduce the persistent gap between demand and supply as \nquickly  and  efficiently  as  possible.  ADB\u2019s  priority  of  improving  efficiency  and  commercial \norientation, and its emphasis on restructuring and reforming policy, is well-matched to evolving \ninstitutional reforms in railways.  \n \n20.  The  evaluation  and  experience  from  completed  and  ongoing  ADB-financed  railway \nprojects  in  the  PRC  shows  strong  commitment  and  satisfactory  capabilities  of  executing \nagencies for project implementation (Appendix 7). The speed of implementation has generally \nexceeded  expectations  at  appraisal,  and  agencies  have  generally  complied  with  loan \ncovenants. Resettlement and environmental management have been satisfactory. Compliance \nwith audit covenants has been timely, and the audited financial statements have been generally\n                                                 \n14 The China National Oil Petroleum Company financed CNY1.7 billion for Beijing\u2013Tianjin intercity railway line, whose \nconstruction started in July 2005 and was completed in August 2008. \n15 China Communication Construction Engineering Group, Beijing; China Engineering Construction Group, Beijing; \nand Shaanxi Province Hualong Energy Limited Liability Company, Xi\u2019an. \n16 The  Guangzhou\u2013Shenzhen  joint-venture  railway  company  is  listed  on  the  Shanghai  Stock  Exchange,  the \nHong Kong Stock Exchange, and the New York Stock Exchange. \n17 ADB. 2007.

Of the 15 ADB-supported railway projects, 10 have been completed and 5 are \nunder implementation.18 \n \n21.  Previous  railway  projects  have  contributed  to  socioeconomic  development  in  the \nprojects\u2019 influence areas. Their main impact is as follows: (i) new railway lines in less-developed \nregions stimulated economic development, resulting in higher growth rates of gross domestic \nproduct  and  rural  incomes  compared  with  the  \u201cwithout-project\u201d  scenario;19 (ii) construction \nactivities generated demand for unskilled labor and employment of poor workers, including \nwomen, who would otherwise have remained unemployed or underemployed;20 (iii) service \nroads built for construction activities opened up and benefited rural communities in inaccessible \nareas; (iv) domestic resource mobilization improved, providing additional resources for social \nprograms21 and  generating  employment;  (v)  supply  and  transportation  of  local  materials \nimproved; (vi) improved and lower-cost transport resulted in lower prices of agricultural inputs \n(such as fertilizers), which stimulated cash-crop farming and provided more income to farmers, \nincreased the mobility of rural residents, and allowed access to more markets, employment \nopportunities, and social services beyond the immediate communities; (vii) counties provided \nwith  new  railway  access  recorded  higher  gross  domestic  product  growth  rates  than  other \ncounties; (viii) the investment environment improved, and secondary and tertiary industries, \nwhich generated employment, developed rapidly;22 (ix) the consequent shift in the structure of \nemployment from low-productivity agriculture to higher-productivity agro-processing and light \nindustry increased employment opportunities for women, whose incomes and social status then \nimproved;23 (x) tourism developed as railway travel became more affordable and convenient; \nand (xi) environmental protection and mitigation measures were taken under the projects in \naccordance with the environmental impact assessments (EIAs) for the projects. The railway \nprojects have helped transform the local economies: per capita rural incomes have increased \n                                                 \n18 ADB. 2003.

Rural income per capita in Xinfeng county increased yearly by 18.5%, from CNY802 in 1993 to CNY2,222 \nin 1998, compared with 10.3% in 1985\u20131992 (before the Project). \n20 The first 2 years of construction of the Guizhou\u2013Shuibai Railway generated a total of about 7.5 million person-days \nof employment; 4.1 million person-days, or about 55%, went to local poor people, who were thereby raised above \nthe poverty line. \n21 The financial revenue of 10 poverty counties in Jiangxi province that are traversed by the Jing\u2013Jiu Railway \nincreased from CNY0.5 billion in 1993 to CNY1.4 billion in 1998\u2014an annual increase of 22.7% compared with \n12.3% in 1985\u20131992, before the construction of the railway. \n22 The Jing\u2013Jiu Railway facilitated the setting up of many resource- and agriculture-based industries in Xingfeng \ncounty of Jiangxi province\u2014from 3 in 1992 to 39 in 1998, after project completion. The number of businesses grew \nfrom 8,005 in 1992 to 19,287 in 1998, and the number of persons employed in these businesses increased from \n18,484 in 1992 to 52,153 in 1998\u2014an annual increase of 23%. In the same county, the number of people living \nbelow the poverty line was reduced by 62%, from 30,400 in 1993 to 11,580 in 1998. \n23 Beneficial income and social impact, particularly on women, was noted in the influence areas of the Yaogu\u2013\nMaoming Railway and Guang\u2013Mei\u2013Shan Railway. \n ", "8 \nsubstantially, living standards have improved, and poverty has been reduced. These lessons \nlearned and experiences gained were considered in the design of the Project. \n \n4.  Rationale \n22.  The  project  rationale  reflects  (i)  network  development;  (ii) capacity  enhancement; \n(iii) safety enhancement; (iv) support for the PRC railway development plan and the western \nregion development strategy; and (v) promotion of pro-poor economic growth along the railway \nline and in the region, thereby reducing poverty. The Project will pursue the operational reforms, \nincluding  emphasis  on  safety  and  the  introduction  of  safe  and  reliable  technology,  faster \nspeeds, double-stack container operation under an electrified line, modern dispatch control \nsystems, and high-quality information systems on the railway network. \n \n23.  The proposed CLR is part of the shortest east\u2013west corridor linking Shanghai, Qingdao, \nWuhan, Yichang, and other major cities and ports in the east to Chongqing and Chengdu in the \nwest. The proposed alignment for the CLR is 369 km shorter than the existing route between \nShanghai and Chengdu. Traversing Hubei province, and Chongqing municipality, the proposed \nrailway  line  will  connect  with  Shanghai\u2013Wuhan\u2013Yichang\u2013Lichuan  in  the  east,  Chongqing\u2013\nHuaihua railway in the center, the proposed Lanzhou\u2013Chongqing24 and Xi\u2019an\u2013Chongqing main \nlines in the north, Chongqing\u2013Chengdu in the west, and Chongqing\u2013Kunming in the south. \n \n24.  The project area for Chongqing\u2013Lichuan is largely mountainous, with abundant natural \nreserves of coal, natural gas, nonferrous materials, and famous tourist sites. But despite the \nabundant natural resources, many people are poor and the economic growth necessary to \nreduce rural poverty has failed to materialize because of inadequate transport services and high \ncosts.  Local  governments  and  people  living  in  the  project  area  see  the  railway  as  a  key \ninvestment for addressing this problem. The development of the railway line and associated \ndevelopments are expected to stimulate industrial and natural resources development, promote \ntourism and related industries, generate employment and increase living standards, and help to \nreduce  poverty.  The  Project  is  a  part  of  the  Government\u2019s  program  for  the  integrated \ndevelopment of transportation facilities, which includes the project railway, the upgrading of \nhighways, and the construction of link and access roads to the hinterland. Other infrastructure, \nsuch as water supply and investment to improve education and health care facilities, are also \nplanned. The railway will play an important role in facilitating the development and integration of \nthis poor and underdeveloped region. \n \n25.  CLR will be a joint-venture railway owned and operated by MOR and the Chongqing \nmunicipal government. Joint-venture railways, which account for 9,517 km (2007) of the PRC \nsystem,  have  substantial  managerial  and  financial  autonomy,  including  the  freedom  to  set \ntariffs, which are several times higher than those of the national network. Freight and passenger \ntraffic on joint-venture railways have grown faster than on national railways. Between 1996 and \n2007, passenger traffic grew from 2.2 billon passenger-km to 31.5 billion passenger-km (or by \n28% yearly, compared with 7% on the national railway network), and freight traffic rose from \n12.3 billion ton-km to 155.2 billion ton-km (or by 26.5% yearly, compared with 5% on the \nnational railway network). Joint-venture railways are more efficient, employing only 8\u201310 people \nper km, compared with about 25 people per km for national railways. The project company will \nemploy 8\u201310 people per km. \n \n                                                 \n24 The proposed loan for PRC: Lanzhou\u2013Chongqing Railway Development Project was circulated for consideration by \nADB for Board approval on 18 November 2008.  \n ", "  9 \n26.  The Project is a key intervention in the railway sector, with many technical, operational, \nsafety,  economic,  and  financial  benefits.  The  Project  will  reduce  the  transportation  costs \nsignificantly compared to existing bus and truck fares thereby providing a cheaper and more \naffordable mode of transport. ADB financing is playing a catalytic role in financing this project. \nCLR will introduce double-stack container operation, under an electrified track. This will increase \nthe throughput and carrying capacity, reduce the land requirement, and reduce the energy \nconsumption and emission per ton-km\u2014all of which will lead to a more affordable, faster, cheap, \nsafe, energy-efficient, and more environment-friendly mode of transport in the region. Running \nconventional trains and double-stack container trains under a common track is a technological \nchallenge that will need higher axle-loads, adjusted tunnel and bridge dimensions, and new \ntechnologies for power transfer from overhead electric traction to adapt to the increased height \ndifference between conventional trains and the double-stack container trains. A corporate entity \nhas been set up to construct, operate, and manage the CLR, and that it will help enhance the \nfinancial viability and private sector participation. ADB is assisting in institutional, marketing, and \nbusiness development for the project company. The agreed tariffs are affordable and financially \nviable. When complete, the Project will provide a shorter link to the west, releasing capacity on \nthe existing railway lines.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n27.  The  impact  of  the  Project  will  be  an  improved  transport  system  in  the  Shanghai\u2013\nChengdu  corridor  that  supports  socioeconomic  development  and  the  western  development \nstrategy. This will be achieved through the provision of efficient, affordable, environment-friendly \nand  energy-efficient  railway  transportation  in  unserved,  less-developed  areas,  creating  the \nconditions necessary for developing local resources and generating employment and income-\nenhancing opportunities.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n28.  The  Project  comprises  (i)  the  construction  of  259  km  of  double-track,  electrified, \nstandard-gauge Class I railway from Chongqing to Lichuan; (ii) the construction of eight new \nrailway stations complete with facilities; (iii) safety initiatives, including the provision of modern \ntechnology and equipment to enhance safety; (iv) the provision of signaling, communication, \nand management information systems; (v) training in the use and maintenance of modern \nequipment; (vi) consulting services for construction supervision, monitoring and evaluation, and \nmarketing  and  business  development;  and  (vii)  institutional  strengthening.  The  key  inputs \nneeded for project implementation are civil works, equipment, consultants, MOR, and project \ncompany staff (see Supplementary Appendix B for characteristics of the Chongqing\u2013Lichuan \nRailway).  \n \nC.  Special Features \n29.  Energy Benefits. Railways are a more energy-efficient and environment-friendly mode \nof transport than road transport\u20146\u201310 times more efficient, by some estimates. The rolling \nresistance of a steel wheel on a rail is much less than that of rubber tires on a pavement. The \nUnited States Department of Energy has estimated25 the energy intensity of rail freight at \n345 British thermal units (BTU) per ton-mile and road freight at 3,476 BTU per ton-mile. This \n                                                 \n25 US Department of Energy. 2006. Transportation Energy Data Book, Edition 26. Washington, DC. \n ", "10 \nindicates that rail is about 10 times as energy-efficient as truck transport\u2014an estimate similar to \nthat made by Canadian researchers.26 According to the International Energy Agency report27 \nand fuel data from the China Statistical Yearbook 2006,28 the diverted traffic from road to rail, \nand from existing rail to CLR, will result in a benefit (on account of reduced fuel consumption) of \nCNY204 million per year from 2014.  \n \n30.  Environment Benefits. There is a direct relationship between energy consumption and \nemission of harmful pollutants, and rail transport emits far fewer harmful elements compared \nwith road. These emissions include carbon dioxide (CO ), nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons, sulfur \n2\noxides, and suspended particles. At the specific fuel usage and emission rates for the PRC, the \ndiversion of traffic from road to rail will reduce CO  emissions by 137,000 tons by 2014, and this \n2\nfigure is projected to rise to 207,000 tons by 2020 and 424,000 by 2033 (cumulative savings of \n5.1 million tons from 2014\u20132033). The reductions will result in an annual benefit of CNY17 \nmillion by 2014, increasing to CNY53 million by 2033. \n \n31.  Intermodal Transport or Container Transport. The Project will promote railway and \nmultimodal transport of goods in the region by introducing double-stack container operation \nunder an electrified track, which will reduce land use, increase carrying capacity by 60% on the \nsame track, improve energy and environment efficiency by 40%\u201360%, and move cargo more \nsafely and efficiently. MOR will construct two extra-large container terminals at Chongqing and \nWuhan  to  (i)  attract  high-value  traffic  on  the  railways;  (ii)  promote  intermodal  traffic;  and \n(iii) encourage private sector shippers and freight forwarders to use the facility for export and \nimport of cargo to other parts of the PRC, and ports in the east and Yunnan in the south. The \nconstruction of these container terminals will be financed by MOR and completed by 2010. \n \n32.  Corporate Governance. ADB\u2019s policy reform agenda in the railway sector emphasizes \nMOR restructuring, commercial operations, support for the autonomous management of railway \noperations,  human  resources  development,  and  improved  financial  management  and \naccounting systems. The setting up of the joint-venture railways is a key ADB intervention. \nUnder the Project, a corporate entity has been set up and its capacity development will be \nsupported.  ADB-financed  consulting  services  will  assist  in  strengthening  the  institutional, \nmarketing, and business development functions of the project company. \n \n33.  Opportunities for the Private Sector. The project company will outsource activities \nsuch as consulting services for construction supervision, testing, construction contracts, track \nmaintenance, and industrial sidings by open competition. Private sector initiatives such as \nonboard  train  services  (including  catering,  cleaning,  and  loading  and  unloading  at  railway \nstations) will be promoted. Station space will be developed and rented out by open competition, \nand industrial sidings, hotels, restaurants, and other logistic facilities will be encouraged in the \nvicinity of stations. \n \n34.  Reforms. ADB has engaged MOR in dialogue to enhance policy reform during the \nproject processing, and this will continue. Equity participation by the Chongqing municipality and \nthe setting up of a corporate entity to construct, operate, and manage the Project are significant \nsteps to be taken. The possibility of diversified financing sources has also been explored. The \nChina Construction Bank (CCB) has already committed itself to providing financing.

MOR will continue separating core from noncore activities \nand rationalizing its staff resources.  \n \n35.  Stakeholder  Consultation  and  Participation.  Extensive  consultations,  including \nsurveys, have involved about 7,300 people\u2014local villagers, tourists, businesspersons, transport \nusers,  and  local  governments  (Appendix  8).  These  consultations  have  helped  in \n(i) understanding public opinion about the proposed railway; (ii) conducting the environmental, \neconomic, and social assessments; (iii) planning the resettlement; and (iv) identifying the roles \nof the various stakeholders. Leading groups have been formed in the prefectures with the \nparticipation of relevant government agencies, including poverty reduction offices; the All-China \nWomen\u2019s Federation; and health, civil affairs, and ethnic affairs bureaus. The local governments \nhave given their assurances that the consultation process will be continued to finalize the \nproject  design  and  implement  appropriate  land  compensation,  relocation,  livelihood, \nrehabilitation, and environmental management measures. \n \n36.  Small-Business  Development  Opportunities.  The  Project  includes  eight  railway \nstations, which will be connected to villages, townships, and counties by roads and other \ntransport networks. These stations and the station access roads, and other link roads, will help \nin the development of small businesses and commercial activities, including the setting up of \nsmall shops, kiosks, local handicraft shops, and areas where local people can sell local fruits \nand agro-products. The local governments will ensure that the railway stations and surrounding \nareas are developed with local communities to promote local businesses, income-generating \nactivities, and other opportunities that can benefit all communities, especially the poor and \nwomen,  and  they  have  agreed  to  provide  entrepreneurial  training  and  start-up  capital \n(microfinance)  for  small  businesses  to  local  people.  The  Project  will  also  support  tourism \ndevelopment  in  Chongqing  and  Hubei,  both  important  tourist  destinations.  The  local \ngovernments have been successful in providing support to the communities (including the poor) \nto promote tourism businesses such as village homestays and handicrafts. The provincial and \nlocal  governments  have  agreed  to  increase  such  support  by  reallocating  some  of  the  tax \nrevenue increase from the Project. \n \n37.  Complementary Development Initiatives. ADB held extensive discussions with the \nChongqing and Hubei provincial and local governments about providing road access, good \ndrinking water, and telephone connectivity to all the poverty villages along the alignment, to \nenhance development impact in the project area. The provincial and local governments agreed \nto provide for these in the 11FYP. The local governments agreed, in principle, to provide road \naccess to 93 villages, drinking water to 656 villages, and telephone connections to 57 villages \nby the end of 2014. ADB also dialogued with local governments on the possibility of reallocating \npart  of  the  construction  tax  revenue  (3.4%  of  the  value  of  the  civil  works  contract)  to \ndevelopment programs in the project area. The local governments agreed to reallocate part of \nthe tax revenue to relevant agencies for that purpose. \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n \n38.  The project investment cost is estimated at $3,071.11 million. The project investment \nplan is summarized in Table 1 and its details can be found in Appendix 9. The cost estimates \nare based on quantities derived from preliminary engineering designs and unit rates reflecting \nmarket  prices  for  goods  and  materials,  and  include  the  costs  of  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement, and environmental monitoring. \n \n ", "12 \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan ($ million) \nItem  Amount \nA.

Financing Plan \n39.  The Government has requested a loan of $150 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a term of 26 years, including a grace \nperiod of 6 years, an interest rate determined according to ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15%, conversion options that may be \nexercised according to ADB\u2019s loan regulations and conversion guidelines, and other terms and \nconditions set forth in the Loan Agreement. The Government has provided ADB with (i) reasons \nfor its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility according to these terms \nand conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision \nand not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n40.  ADB will finance selected contract packages to be procured under the ADB loan; these \nrelate,  among  others,  to  railway  track  work;  electric  power  and  traction;  signaling, \ncommunication, and other equipment; and international consulting services. CCB and MOR will \nfinance the remaining foreign exchange cost. The local currency cost will be financed by MOR \nand the Chongqing municipal government (CMG), and cofinanced through a loan from the CCB. \nCCB has appraised the Project and has provided a commitment letter to MOR. The CCB loan is \nrepayable over 20 years, including a grace period of 5 years, at a lending rate currently at 6.6% \nper year. CMG will finance the land acquisition and resettlement costs; this will be its equity \ncontribution. MOR and CMG have made budgetary provisions for the counterpart funds.

Implementation Arrangements \n  1.  Project Management \n \n41.  MOR will be the Executing Agency, responsible for overall project implementation. The \nForeign Capital and Technical Import Center (FCTIC), under MOR, will coordinate the tasks of \nthe project management office and be responsible for procurement, withdrawals, and reporting \nto ADB. A project company (a limited-liability company under the PRC Company Law), with \nheadquarters at Chongqing has been set up, which will implement the Project. The project \ncompany will (i) assist in the construction of the project railway and manage and operate the \nproject railway after its construction; and (ii) develop and implement adequate and transparent \nbusiness  development  mechanisms,  and  accounting  and  reporting  systems.  The  project \ncompany is headed by a director general and assisted by an adequate number of suitably \nqualified professional staff with experience in railway engineering, financial, and administrative \nmatters, and in the implementation of projects financed by international financial institutions. \nThe company has set up on-site construction management offices along the project route. To \ndevelop the project management, business development, and marketing capacity of the project \ncompany, assistance will be provided through project-financed consulting services.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n42.  The Project will be implemented over 6 years. Civil works for CLR will start in May 2009 \nand will be completed in 5 years. Trial operations will start in January 2014 and will go on for a \nyear before commercial operations begin (Appendix 10). \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n43.  All  ADB-financed  procurement  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended from time to time). ADB will finance the procurement of materials and equipment as \ndescribed in the procurement plan (Appendix 11). Contracts valued at $1 million or more will be \nprocured through international competitive bidding. Contracts valued at less than $1 million will \nbe procured through international competitive bidding or national competitive bidding, according \nto the PRC Tendering and Bidding Law (1999) and subject to clarifications agreed on with ADB. \nBelow $100,000, procurement will follow the shopping procedure. MOR will select tendering \ncompanies on a competitive basis to handle international bidding. The relevant sections of \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) will be included in all documents and \ncontracts during the bidding for, and implementation of, the Project. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n44.  The Government will engage and finance the services of qualified national consultants \nfor (i) detailed project design; (ii) the preparation of technical specifications; (iii) construction \n ", "14 \nsupervision;  (iv)  construction  quality  assurance;  (v)  environmental  supervision  and \nmanagement;  (vi)  the  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  resettlement  plan;  and \n(vii) socioeconomic  impact  assessment,  evaluation  of  poverty  reduction,  and  project \nperformance monitoring. \n \n45.  The  ADB  loan  will  be  used  to  finance  8  person-months  of  international  consulting \nservices to strengthen the institutional, marketing, and business development functions of the \nproject company. The terms of reference for the international consultants\u2014to be recruited through \nquality- and cost-based selection (80% technical and 20% financial) and simplified technical \nproposal, according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from \ntime to time)\u2014are in Appendix 12. The provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy will be included \nin all invitation documents and contracts for international consultants.  \n \n  5.  Anticorruption Policy \n46.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy has been explained to, and discussed with the Government. \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB \nreserves the right to investigate, directly or though its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, \ncollusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant \nprovisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations and the bidding \ndocuments for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the \nProject shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and \naccounts of MOR, the project company, and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other \nservice providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n47.  In relation to the Project, MOR will ensure that (i) a supervisory body is established to \nprevent undue interference in business practices, and adequate resources are made available \nfor its effective operation; (ii) a leading group of officials from the supervision division of MOR is \nlocated in offices involved in the bidding, construction, and other operational activities under the \nProject; and (iii) periodic inspections of the contractor\u2019s activities related to fund withdrawals and \nsettlements are carried out. MOR and the project company shall also initiate liaison meetings \nwith the prosecutor\u2019s office, as needed, to discuss any warnings about, or information on, \nalleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n48.  The ADB loan will be disbursed according to ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2007, as amended from time to time). Since most payments will be made for large contracts, \ndirect payment, reimbursement, and commitment procedures will be used. If the Government \ninitially  funds  eligible  expenditures,  ADB\u2019s  reimbursement  procedure  will  be  followed.  To \nfacilitate disbursements, MOR has requested the creation of an imprest account29 after loan \neffectiveness.  The  ceiling  of  the  imprest  account  will  not  exceed  either  the  estimated \nexpenditures for the next 6 months or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. To expedite \nfunds flow and simplify documentation, the statement-of-expenditures procedure will be used for \nthe liquidation and replenishment of the imprest account and the reimbursement of eligible \nexpenditures not exceeding $200,000 per individual payment. The reimbursement, liquidation, \nor replenishment of payments in excess of the statement-of-expenditures ceiling will require full \nsupporting documentation. The financial assessment questionnaire indicates that the Project will \nhave an adequate financial management system in place. The funds from ADB loan will flow \n                                                 \n29 Imprest accounts are used in three ongoing loans in the PRC. Their utilization performance is satisfactory. \n ", "  15 \ndirectly to MOR, the EA, who will be responsible for disbursements for the contract packages \nfinanced by ADB (details in Supplementary Appendix C). \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n49.  The MOR and the project company will maintain separate accounts for the Project and \nhave such accounts and related financial statements audited annually by an external auditor \naccording to auditing standards acceptable to ADB. MOR and the project company, through \nMOR, will submit to ADB, within 6 months after the end of each fiscal year, certified copies of \nsuch audited project accounts and financial statements and auditor\u2019s reports, all in English. The \naudit of such financial statements will include, as part of the auditor\u2019s report, (i) an assessment \nof the adequacy of accounting and internal control systems with respect to project expenditures \nand other financial transactions, (ii) an assessment of compliance with loan covenants and ADB \nrequirements  for  project  management,  (iii)  an  opinion  on  the  use  of  the  statement-of-\nexpenditures procedure, and (iv) an opinion on the use of an imprest account. The project \ncompany,  through  MOR,  will  also  submit  its  audited  financial  statements  covering  income \nstatements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements during the first 3 years of commercial \noperations of the project railway, within 6 months after the end of each fiscal year. To ensure \nthat effective internal control systems and checks and balances are put in place, the project \ncompany will establish an internal audit unit within the company. The unit will independently test \nfinancial transactions to ensure the safe custody of the project-financed assets, and report \ndirectly to the project company\u2019s board of directors. \n \n50.  The project company will make satisfactory arrangements for reporting the progress of \nproject implementation by submitting quarterly progress reports through MOR. Within 3 months \nof completion, MOR will submit a project completion report to ADB. \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n51.  MOR has agreed to a set of indicators for evaluating the performance of the Project in \nrelation to its impact, outcomes, outputs, and conditions. The indicators, to be reviewed at the \nstart  of  project  implementation,  comprise  (i)  economic  development  and  socioeconomic \nindicators, (ii) transport costs and time for passenger and freight services, (iii) transport services \nand transport charges, (iv) accident rates, (v) financial sustainability, (vi) county and sample \nvillage  incomes,  (vii) access  to  social  services,  and  (viii)  jobs  created  in  construction  and \nmaintenance.  At  the  start  of  project  implementation,  MOR  and  the  project  company  will \nestablish baseline and target values for the indicators. The indicators will be measured at \nproject  inception,  completion,  and  3  years  later,  and  compared  with  the  baseline.  Where \nrelevant, indicators will be disaggregated by gender (Appendix 13). MOR will recruit qualified \nconsultants  for  monitoring  and  evaluation  to  help  establish  the  monitoring  and  evaluation \nsystem,  and  train  the  project  company  staff  in  its  use.  The  main  sources  of  data  are \n(i) government sources (secondary data), (ii) a household socioeconomic sample survey, and \n(iii) participatory rapid appraisal. MOR will submit to ADB a report summarizing the key findings \nof monitoring at inception, completion, and 3 years later. \n \n9.  Project Review \n52.  ADB,  MOR, and the project company will carry out periodic reviews, as well as a \nmidterm review, of the Project, covering all institutional, administrative, organizational, technical, \nenvironmental, social, poverty reduction, resettlement, economic, financial, and other relevant \naspects that may have an impact on the performance of the Project and its continuing viability. \n ", "16 \nThe  review  will  examine  progress  in  sector  reforms,  policy  development,  resettlement, \nenvironment, poverty impact, and compliance with covenants in the Loan Agreement. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACT, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n53.  The project benefits and impact have been assessed, along with the potential risks \nassociated with the Project. The combined benefits and impact will outweigh the costs, and net \nbenefits will accrue to the project area. \n \nA.  Traffic Forecast \n54.  The traffic forecast is based on forecasts prepared by the Second Survey and Design \nInstitute and the assessment of TA consultants after considering expected economic growth, \npopulation increase, tourism development potential, local government development plans, and \nmarket  surveys.  The  passenger  volume  on  the  CLR  is  forecast  to  grow  from  8.38 billion \npassenger-km in 2014 to 25.78 billion passenger-km in 2033, for an average growth rate of \n6.4% yearly. The freight traffic on the CLR corridor is forecast, on the basis of similar factors, to \nincrease from about 7.16 billion ton-km in 2014 to 20.13 billion ton-km in 2033, or by 5.9% \nyearly.  The  projected  volumes  can  be  accommodated  by  the  CLR  and  justify  project \nconstruction. \n \nB.  Economic Benefits \n55.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated through a comparison of the \nwith- and without-project situations, using constant 2008 economic prices. The CLR will reduce \nthe  cost  of  transport  to  and  from  the  poor  parts  of  Chongqing  and  Hubei  province.  The \neconomic  costs  include  construction,  operation,  and  maintenance  costs,  and  the  value  of \nagricultural production from land lost permanently. The economic benefits include (i) operating \ncost savings for freight and passenger traffic; (ii) time saved as a result of the diversion of \npassenger  traffic  from  buses  trucks,  and  other  rail  lines;  (iii)  transport  benefits  generated; \n(iv) tourism benefits; (v) road infrastructure and maintenance costs avoided; (vi) shipper savings \nresulting  from  increased  railway  competition;  (vii)  road  accidents  avoided;  (viii)  reduced \npollution; (ix) energy savings; and (x) national productivity benefits. The project EIRR is 16.7%, \nindicating that the Project is economically viable (Appendix 14). Sensitivity analysis confirms the \nrobustness of the Project\u2019s economic viability. Changes in the key variables, such as a 20% \nreduction in benefits, do not significantly affect economic viability. The civil works cost would \nhave to increase by 60.0% over the estimate for the EIRR to fall below the cutoff rate of 12%. \nFreight benefits would have to fall by 44.0% and passenger benefits by 936.8%. Given the \nexperience in the PRC railway sector, variations of such magnitude are unlikely. Project risks \nwere quantified through the statistical method, i.e., by considering the possible value for key \nvariables and the probability of their occurrence. The result shows minimal probability of EIRR \nfalling  below  12%.  Distribution  analysis,  undertaken  by  determining  the  project  effects  for \nvarious beneficiaries, indicates that a large portion of net benefits will accrue to project users \nand the economy. \n \nC.  Financial Benefits \n56.  Financial  projections  were  prepared  for  the  project  company,  according  to  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  the  Financial  Analysis  and  Management  of  Projects  (2005),  to  assess  the \nfinancial viability and sustainability of the railway. The projected financial statements indicate \nthat financial revenues will be sufficient to cover operation and maintenance costs, income \n ", "  17 \ntaxes, and debt service, and to provide a reasonable rate of return. The financial evaluation was \nundertaken in real terms, using constant 2008 prices. The project cost estimates and financial \nprojections in nominal terms were converted to real terms by adjusting for the projected effects \nof foreign and domestic inflation and currency fluctuation. Incremental costs and benefits were \nderived under with- and without-project scenarios. The financial internal rate of return, after tax, \nis 5.48%. This compares favorably with the weighted average cost of capital, also after tax, of \n2.80%. The Project is both financially viable and sustainable. Sensitivity and risk analyses \nindicate that the financial internal rate of return for the Project is robust under most conditions. \n \n57.  Consolidated  financial  statements  for  the  project  company  have  been  prepared. \nAccording to the consultant\u2019s estimates, the project company is projected to have a sound and \nsustainable financial performance over the operating period (Appendix 15). Financial ratios have \nbeen discussed and covenanted. \n \nD.  Environmental Impact and Assessment \n58.  The Project is classified as ADB environmental category A. An EIA, prepared by the \nSecond Survey and Design Institute for the Project, was approved by the State Environmental \nProtection Administration on 24 March 2008. MOR has endorsed the summary environmental \nimpact assessment, which was circulated to ADB\u2019s Board of Directors and uploaded to the ADB \nwebsite on 4 January 2008.  \n \n59.  The  potential  adverse  environmental  impact  of  the  Project  includes  (i)  noise  and \nvibration impact on nearby residents, (ii) soil erosion from cut and fill activities, (iii) impact on \nsurface water quality of adjacent waterways, and (iv) impact on public health and safety. \n \n60.  The EIA concluded that the adverse environmental impact can be successfully mitigated \nthrough best practices and appropriate technologies. The implementation of the environmental \nmanagement, mitigation, and monitoring programs included in the EIA will ensure compliance \nwith ADB and government environmental guidelines and procedures. Internal and external \nmonitoring and audits will be conducted to ensure that standards and regulations are followed. \nAn independent monitoring agency will be hired to carry out external monitoring and evaluation \nwork during implementation. \n \nE.  Impact on Poverty \n61.  The railway will traverse seven districts and counties in the eastern part of Chongqing \ncity and one county in the western part of Hubei province; two of these are designated national \nor provincial poverty counties. The Project will benefit about 5.5 million people in the project \narea; of these, 3.6 million (65%) are in the countryside and include 590,000 poor people \n(16.4%) with a net income per capita of less than CNY900 in 2005. There are 681 designated \npoverty villages, many of which lack access to potable water. Poverty is concentrated in the \nthree counties (Fengdu, Shizhu and Lichuan) farthest from Chongqing, which are isolated by \nmountains  and  poor  transport  facilities.  The  links  between  poverty,  topography,  and  poor \ntransport systems are apparent in the project area. Poverty in this area is caused by (i) adverse \nenvironmental and weather conditions and limited farmland (e.g., mountains, water scarcity, and \nsoil erosion); (ii) geographical remoteness and isolation, and high transport costs; (iii) limited \naccess to credit for rural enterprises; (iv) lack of access to good social and health-care facilities; \nand (v) high cost of middle- and higher-level education. The summary poverty reduction and \nsocial strategy is in Appendix 16. \n ", "18 \n62.  During construction, about 119,000 person-years of work will be created for unskilled \nlaborers; of this total 50% or more (59,500 person-years with total wages of CNY446 million) will \nbe targeted at the poor. The use of locally produced materials for railway construction will \ngenerate an additional 22,000 person-years of work for unskilled laborers, with total wages of \nCNY165.5 million. The construction tax revenue will be reallocated to counties and used for a \nrange of poverty reduction and social activities. Priority will be given to women, people affected \nby resettlement, ethnic minorities, and other vulnerable people. Once the new railway starts \noperation in 2014, an estimated 3,530 direct and indirect jobs will be created with total wages of \nCNY35.3 million annually. The project\u2019s eight new railway stations will be connected to the road \nnetwork accessible by all villages, including the poor, and will create various jobs, thus helping \ndistribute the benefits in the project area. There will be enough space in and around the stations \nfor local area development, and local governments will support the poor, women, ethnic groups, \nand other vulnerable people in setting up shop and selling local specialties and other goods and \nservices. The new railway will provide significantly cheaper and more affordable transportation \ncompared to roads. All of this direct and indirect impact will provide opportunities for poor \nfamilies to (i) move away from unsustainable, mountainous farmlands; (ii) provide a cheaper \nmode  of  travel;  (iii)  have  better  access  to markets,  and  advanced  educational  and  health \nfacilities, especially for women; and (iv) build a sustainable future in new centers of economic \nactivity. \n \nF.  Resettlement Impact \n63.  The project railway alignment will affect 29 townships and 84 villages as it passes \nthrough  the  seven districts  and  counties  that  compose  the  project  area.  An  estimated \n711 hectares of land will be permanently acquired; about 62.3% of this is now under cultivation \nand the rest (37.1%) is predominately forestland. Since the railway will require only a narrow \ncorridor, the average loss of land per household is estimated to be 15%; this means that about \n35,000 persons will be partially affected. The Project will temporarily occupy an estimated \n674 hectares during construction. Also, 391,000 square meters of structures will be demolished; \nof  these,  86%  will  be  residential  structures,  and  5,314  persons  will  therefore  have  to  be \nrelocated. The summary resettlement plan is shown in Appendix 17. \n \n64.  MOR,  in  consultation  with  the  provincial  and  local  governments,  has  prepared  a \nresettlement plan based on the feasibility study, surveys in 48 affected villages, 337 household \nsurveys, local government statistics, and consultations with local officials, village leaders, and \naffected  households.  The  impact  is  spread  thinly  over  a  long,  narrow  corridor.30 Local \ngovernment  land  administration  bureaus,  in  conjunction  with  railway  construction  support \noffices, will be responsible for implementing resettlement; many activities will be carried out by \ntownship officials and village committees. The estimated resettlement cost is $69.93 million, \nexcluding contingencies. The Chongqing municipal government will fund the entire cost of land \nacquisition and resettlement, as an equity contribution to the Project. The resettlement budget \nwill be adjusted to conform to the actual measurement of physical losses, market prices, and \nfinal compensation rates. Affected people have been consulted about the likely impact during \nthe feasibility and preliminary design stages. Resettlement information booklets, in the local \nlanguage,  have  been  distributed  to  the  affected  villages.  The  resettlement  plan  has  been \nendorsed by MOR and uploaded to the ADB website on 4 September 2007. MOR will submit an \nupdated resettlement plan to ADB by 15 December 2008. MOR and municipal land acquisition \n                                                 \n30 Land use for railways is much less compared with that of a highway of equivalent capacity (a 16-lane highway is \nrequired to equal the cargo-carrying capacity of a double-track railway).   \n ", "  19 \nand resettlement offices, in collaboration with the county resettlement offices, will be responsible \nfor internal supervision and monitoring.  \n \n65.  The  project  area  includes  792,000  people  with  ethnic  minority  nationalities,  which \nrepresent 14.4% of the project area\u2019s population. The main ethnic group in the project area, the \nTujia,  has  been  integrated  with  the  Han  for  nearly  200  years  and  shares  the  same \nsocioeconomic conditions, as investigations showed, and there have been a large number of \nintermarriages. An estimated 200 Tujia households will be relocated and about 1,000 will have \npartial loss of farmland. Since some of the affected minority villages are poor, the resettlement \nplan specifically provides for livelihood training, employment in construction, access to rural \ncredit, assistance with house construction, and social security. The Project includes a social \ndevelopment action plan (SDAP) to enhance the benefits to poor or vulnerable people in the \nproject area. Tujia minorities are a target group in the SDAP (Appendix 18). \n \nG.  Social and Gender Aspects \n66.  The Project will generate job opportunities (skilled and unskilled) for the poor, ethnic \nminorities,  women,  and  other  vulnerable  groups,  which  will  help  develop  their  job  skills. \nSufficient areas for income-generating activities will be designated in and around the station \nareas.  Through  several  ongoing  programs  along  the  alignment,  the  All-China  Women\u2019s \nFederation  will  specifically  address  the  needs  of  women  and  children.  The  federation  will \noperate even more actively in the project area so that women are able to take full advantage of \nadditional work and income opportunities facilitated by the Project to build businesses that help \nsustain their families. The expansion of secondary and tertiary industries will help generate \nadditional long-term employment opportunities for both men and women. Afforestation activities \nwill provide additional employment opportunities for women relatively close to their homes. \n \n67.  The construction and operation of the railway could have an impact on the spread of \nHIV/AIDS and/or sexually transmitted infections (STIs) because of the large number of workers \nduring construction. The project area has much smaller numbers of HIV/AIDS-infected people \nthan  other  parts  of  the  PRC,  according  to  discussions  with  local  health  bureaus.  Local \ngovernments have an active public information program for HIV/AIDS awareness, including the \ndistribution of leaflets and posters, and radio and television programs. The health departments \nin these provinces have carried out awareness programs, HIV/AIDS/STIs voluntary counseling \nand testing, and prevention programs; these will be stepped up and monitored closely. During \nthe construction period, the county governments along the alignment will raise public awareness \namong workers and communities. MOR has experience in ensuring that contractors implement \nawareness and prevention programs. Medical clinics have been established in the area of \nconstruction camps, and HIV/AIDS awareness campaigns and preventive measures for workers \nand communities have been organized. These measures have effectively managed the potential \nrisks of HIV/AIDS/STI transmission and other diseases, and will be applied to the Project.  \n \n68.  An SDAP has been prepared in consultation with local governments to enhance the \nproject benefits; ensure that adverse impact is avoided or mitigated; and increase economic \ndevelopment benefits to the poor, women, Tujia people, and the vulnerable in an equitable and \nsustainable manner (Appendix 18). The SDAP will (i) enhance job opportunities for local people; \n(ii) provide training and vocational programs for the poor, women, ethnic minorities, and the \nvulnerable; (iii) support HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention programs; (iv) support income \nrecovery programs for people affected by resettlement; (v) provide awareness and prevention \nprograms  for  safety  during  construction  and  operation;  and  (vi)  promote  local  economic \ndevelopment.  The  plan  will  be  implemented  with  the  participation  of  relevant  government \n ", "20 \nagencies  at  the  local  level\u2014including  poverty  alleviation  offices,  the  All-China  Women\u2019s \nFederation, and health, civil affairs, labor, and ethnic affairs bureaus. Leading groups have been \nformed to continue the process of consultation and coordination among various agencies during \nimplementation. \n \nH.  Risks and Assumptions \n69.  The Project has been formulated to minimize potential risks. In view of the experience \nwith previous railway projects, traffic demand has been estimated conservatively. Sensitivity \ntests indicate that economic circumstances would have to become substantially adverse for the \nProject to lose economic viability. A potential risk is delay in implementation, which would delay \nthe realization of benefits. MOR has successfully built railway lines, such as the Ganzhou\u2013\nLongyan, Hefei\u2013Xi\u2019an, and Jing\u2013Jiu railways. Government, MOR, CMG support for the Project \nand  its  preparation  contributes  to  reducing  the  potential  risk  of  implementation  delays. \nEnvironmental risks will be mitigated by the measures in the environmental management plan \n(EMP) and will be closely monitored during project implementation. \n \n70.  Intermodal competition among railways and roads will create market risks for the project \nrailway. However, the existing road is already congested and capacity constraints are expected \nto worsen. Traffic surveys indicate that the railway has several advantages: lower fares, shorter \ntravel times, safety, and punctuality. The increasing commercial orientation of the joint-venture \nrailway will help lower the risks posed by intermodal competition. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n71.  Specific  Assurances. In addition to the standard assurances, the Government has \ngiven the following assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents. \n \n(i)  Reform  measures.  The  Government  will  take  the  necessary  measures  to \ncontinue the implementation of the railway development plan (2004), including \nthe  separation  of  the  core  railway  operations  from  noncore  transportation \nbusiness operations, the rationalization of staff, and cause the project company \nto outsource select activities. \n \n(ii)  Construction  quality.

Railway Sector Profile \n \n1.  Key Features. Despite government efforts to increase the country\u2019s transport capacity, \nserious constraints and bottlenecks remain, especially in the road and railway sectors. By the \nend of 2007, the PRC\u2019s railway system of 78,000 kilometers (km) comprised 63,600 km of \nnational railways and 14,400 km of joint venture and local railways.  From 1978, when economic \nreforms were first introduced, to 2007, the PRC experienced sustained rapid economic growth. \nThis resulted in a correspondingly rapid increase in demand for transportation. Passenger \ntransport grew by 9% yearly and freight transport by 7.6% yearly during the period. Railways are \nthe principal mode of freight transport in the PRC, accounting for 47.5% of total freight ton-\nkilometers (ton-km) in 2006, followed by 27.9% for inland waterways and sea-to-shore shipping, \n21.1% for roads, 3.3% for pipelines, and 0.2% for civil aviation. Road traffic accounted for \n52.8% of total passenger-kilometers (pass-km), followed by railways with 34.5%, civil aviation \nwith 12.3%, and coastal and inland waterways with 0.4%.  \n \n2.  Recent  Developments.  To  minimize  transport  inefficiencies  and  eliminate  transport \nbottlenecks  that  constrain  efficient  economic  development,  the  Government  increased  its \ninvestment  in  transport  infrastructure  in  the  10th  Five-Year  Plan  (2001\u20132005)  and  the \n11th Five-Year Plan (2006\u20132010). Investment in transport infrastructure as a share of gross \ndomestic  product  (GDP)  more  than  doubled  in  the  last  decade.  The  PRC  had  invested \nCNY308 billion in capital construction to build 6,458 km of new lines, provide 3,275 km of \ndouble lines, and electrify 6,259 km of tracks in the 10th Five-Year Plan. A World Bank study1 \nindicates that total transport investment should increase to at least 3.8% of GDP to avoid the \neconomic costs associated with transport constraints. The Government continues to accord high \npriority to transport infrastructure investments to meet the increase in transport demand. \n \n3.  Future Development Priorities and Outlook. Substantial investments in the road and \nrailway sectors from both domestic and international financing sources, including the private \nsector, are envisaged in the 11th Five-Year Plan (2006\u20132010). The plan continues to emphasize \nrailway  development,  and  seeks  to  accelerate  railway  construction.  It  envisages  (i) the \nconstruction of 17,000 km of new lines, and (ii) the double-tracking and electrification of 45% of \nthe network length. The plan seeks to (i) build a dedicated passenger railway network by \nconstructing  7,000  km  of  passenger-dedicated  lines  by  2010;  (ii)  develop  coal  transport \ncorridors by increasing the capacity of the existing lines; (iii) expand the railway network in the \npoor western region (to 34,000 km); (iv) build international corridors at the southwest and \nnorthwest  borders;  and  (v)  develop  a  nationwide  intermodal  container  network.  A  total \ninvestment of CNY1.5 trillion (CNY1.25 trillion for construction and CNY250 billion for rolling \nstock) is planned in the 11th Five-Year Plan, of which a total of CNY465.2 billion has been spent \nin 2006 and 2007. \n \n4.  In 2004, the State Council approved the new railway development plan (up to 2020). The \nplan seeks to expand the railway network from 74,000 km in 2004 to 100,000 km by 2020. \nIncreasing train speed is a major goal.2 Priority will be given to developing railways in unserved \nareas and regions that lack transport and have remained less developed. The route network \nlength will be increased by 16,000 km to reach 40,000 km in the western region of the PRC by \n                                                 \n1  World Bank. 1998. China: Forward with One Spirit: A Strategy for the Transport Sector. Washington, DC (Report \nNo. 1595-CHA Transport Sector Unit, East Asia and Pacific Regional Office).  \n2  By April 2007, train speed had been increased to over 160 kilometers per hour (km/h) on 14,000 km, and 200\u2013250 \nkm/h on 6,000 km of railway lines. \n ", "28  Appendix 3 \n2020.  The  plan  also  calls  for  separating  passenger  and  freight  traffic  in  heavily  trafficked \ncorridors and for developing 12,000 km of passenger-dedicated corridors by 2020. \n \n5.  Other Development Partner Operations. In the railway subsector, the Japan Bank for \nInternational Cooperation and the World Bank, in addition to the Asian Development Bank (ADB), \nhave been mainly involved in expanding the capacity of national railways. In the past 20 years, the \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation has provided \u00a5578 billion for 15 railway projects to \nexpand rail transport capacity, particularly in major coal transport corridors. It has also financed \nthe development of new sections of the national railway network in inland provinces. Since 1984, \nthe World Bank has provided 12 loans totaling $2.9 billion for 11 national railway projects and one \nlocal railway project (Appendix 4). ADB introduced Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement in 2004 \nto the PRC railway and it has provided 2 loans for about $140 million (Euro 113 million) for \nnetwork expansion. Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau has provided 4 loans for Euro 484 million \nsince 2005. Austria has provided a loan of Euro 35 million in 2006 and Spain provided a loan for \nEuro 78 million in 2005. US Export Import Bank has provided two loans of $300 million for \nprocurement of track equipment since 2003.    \n \nB.  Asian Development Bank Experience \n \n6.  Assistance  to  the  Sector.  ADB  is  the  lead  lender  and  has  focused  on  improving \ninfrastructure in less-developed and poor regions to promote sustainable economic growth and \nreduce poverty. Since 1989, ADB has provided 15 loans totaling over $3.0 billion to help finance \nthe construction of 1,921 km of new railway lines under eight local railway projects, 5,541 km of \nnew railway lines under six national railway projects, and a sector-wide intervention to enhance \nsafety on the PRC railway network. These projects have introduced modern technology and \nimproved the efficiency of railway operation through institutional and structural reforms. ADB \nhas also provided 14 technical assistance initiatives totaling about $6.6 million to promote the \ncommercial operation of railways, establish corporate governance, achieve cost recovery, and \nimprove railway management (Appendix 4).  \n \n7.  Evaluation of Assistance. The evaluation3 of ADB assistance to the transport sector in \nthe PRC concluded that ADB\u2019s program for railways was a success. The evaluation noted that \nin the railway subsector ADB strategic priorities were well-aligned with the PRC\u2019s needs. Its \noverall focus on building railways using modern technologies addressed needs to increase \nrailway capacity and reduce the persistent gap between supply and demand as quickly and \nefficiently  as  possible.  The  priority  given  by  ADB  to  improving  efficiency  and  commercial \norientation, and its emphasis on restructuring and reforming policy was well matched to evolving \ninstitutional reforms in railways. Experience from completed and ongoing ADB-financed railway \nprojects in the PRC shows strong commitment and generally satisfactory capabilities of the \nexecuting  agencies  for  project  implementation.  The  speed  of  implementation  has  often \nexceeded expectation at the time of appraisal. The executing agencies have generally complied \nwith the loan covenants. Resettlement and environmental management have been carried out \nsatisfactorily.  Audited  financial  statements  have  been  submitted  on  time,  and  the  audited \nfinancial statements have been found to be generally acceptable. Of ADB\u2019s 15 railway projects, \n10 are complete, and 5 are under implementation. The projects highlight the need to (i) ensure \nthat the executing agency established for project processing and implementation has adequate \ncapacity; (ii) prepare realistic traffic forecasts; (iii) review constraints on traffic throughout the \nnetwork, and the impact on project viability of existing and planned railway lines and other \ntransportation  modes  that  may  compete  with  the  project  facilities;  and  (iv) finance  railway \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2007.

Per capita rural incomes in project areas have \nsubstantially increased. Living standards have gone up and poverty has been reduced. The \nproject  performance  audit  report4 for  the  ADB-financed  Jing\u2013Jiu  railway  project  in  the  PRC \nconcluded that the project was successful and exceeded its original passenger traffic forecasts. \n \nC.  ADB Strategy \n \n8.  Strategy  and  Priorities.  ADB\u2019s  strategy  for  the  railway  sector  has  three  broad \nobjectives:  (i) improve  economic  efficiency,  (ii) promote  growth  in  poor  inland  provinces  to \nreduce poverty, and (iii) protect the environment and manage natural resources. In pursuit of \nthese  three  objectives,  the  strategy  supports  the  development  of  efficient  and  integrated \ntransport networks to meet the needs of a growing market economy and contribute to reducing \npoverty through investment targeting poorer areas, coupled with policy and institutional reforms. \nBecause of the importance of railway transport for the development of the national economy, \nADB\u2019s  strategy  for  the  railway  sector  is  focused  on  (i) expanding  the  railway  system  by \nconstructing new lines in unserved areas that are less developed and poor, (ii) modernizing and \nincreasing the capacity to improve transport efficiency on key routes of the national railway \nsystem, (iii) commercializing railway operations to sustain efficient operations, (iv) promoting \nenergy  conservation  and  environmental  sustainability,  and  (v) increasing  railway \ncompetitiveness in the transport system through restructuring and reform.  \n \n9.  Poverty Reduction. To heighten the poverty reduction impact of transport investments, \nADB  pays  particular  attention  to  four  issues:  (i) locating  ADB-financed  projects  in \nless-developed  and  poor  regions  where  new  lines  will  stimulate  economic  development, \n(ii) encouraging the maximization of employment of poor people during project construction and \noperation, (iii) supplying local materials that meet the requirements of quality and economy from \npoor villages, and (iv) providing station access roads and link roads to widen the reach of \nproject benefits to poor interior areas. \n \n10.  Governance and Policy Reform Agenda. The ADB policy reform agenda in the railway \nsector  is  contributing  to  the  restructuring  of  the  Ministry  of  Railways  (MOR),  the \ncommercialization of operations, the increased management autonomy of railway operations, \nhuman resource  development, and improvements in financial management and accounting \nsystems. ADB\u2019s policy dialogue with MOR emphasizes the need for operational reforms for the \nrail  network,  including  enhancing  safety  in  construction,  operation,  and  maintenance.  ADB \nsupports the safety and security objective on PRC railways through the introduction of modern \ntechnologies, policy development, legislation, monitoring, and outreach activities (Appendix 6). \n \n11.  Private  Sector  Development.  The  PRC\u2019s  large  infrastructure  needs  require  local \ngovernments to shift from traditional financing modes to the capital markets. In the railway \nsector, a wider role for the private sector is envisaged. MOR has taken steps to create the \nconditions  necessary  to  attract  investments  in  the  project  facilities  and  services  from \nnongovernment and private sector sources. Possible areas include the construction of industrial \nsidings, commercial services, tourism, containerization, and parcel-related businesses. \n \n12.  Regional Cooperation. The PRC is an active participant in three regional cooperation \ninitiatives: (i) the Greater Mekong Subregion, through Yunnan and Guangxi province; (ii) the \nCentral  Asian  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  (CAREC)  initiative,  through  the  Xinjiang \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2002.

Manila.  \n ", "30  Appendix 3 \nAutonomous  Region;  and  (iii) with  Mongolia,  through  Inner  Mongolia.  The  improvement  of \ncross-border trade regimes is a common feature of these initiatives. Since these programs \ninvolve the poorer areas of the PRC, expanding regional markets and options could help reduce \npoverty. The Greater Mekong Subregion and CAREC programs are developing strategies for \ncooperation in transport, of which railway is an important subsector. Steps are being taken to \ndevelop an institutional framework to facilitate the implementation of regional transport projects, \ne.g., Uzbekistan\u2013Kyrgyz Republic\u2013PRC railway development and the Pan-Asian railway project \n(Singapore\u2013Kunming railway link project). \n \nD.  Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n13.  Monitoring Targets, Indicators, Modality, and Processes. The Government monitors \nand  evaluates  sector  performance  annually;  ADB  reviews  this  through  the  process  of  the \ncountry partnership strategy. Indicators for evaluating sector performance include (i) economic \ndevelopment and poverty indicators for the western region; (ii) transport density in relation to \nland area and population; (iii) public and private investment in railways; (iv) transport demand \nfor freight and passengers with modal split data; (v) level of user charges (railway construction \nsurcharges, etc.); and (vi) cross-border traffic volumes with the Central Asian republics, the \nGreater Mekong Subregion, and Mongolia. \n \nTable A3: Railway Sector Road Map \n  Indicators \nItem  2000  2007  2010 \nA.

Introduction \n \n1.  The objective of the Chongqing\u2013Lichuan Railway is to promote sustainable economic \ngrowth  by  enhancing  transportation  capability  in  an  unserved  area,  thereby  creating \nemployment and income-enhancing opportunities, raising incomes, and reducing poverty. To \nachieve this objective, a corporate entity is being set up to construct, operate, and manage the \nProject,  and  to  assist  in  facilitating  economic  developments,  such  as  tourism,  as  well  as \nvalue-added and labor-intensive industries in the project area. The consulting services will \nassist in strengthening the institutional, marketing, and business development functions of the \nProject.  \n \nB.   Scope \n \n2.  The consultants will (i) help with the institutional strengthening of the project company for \nits successful operation in a market environment; (ii) determine the level of tourism, industry, \nand market development expertise of the project company; (iii) undertake research on programs \nand incentives available for attracting tourist and related industry at the county, prefecture, and \nprovince levels; (iv) meet with a selection of potential shippers located or planning to locate \nalong the route of the Chongqing\u2013Lichuan Railway; (v) meet with businesspeople of Changshu, \nChongqing, Fuling, and Lichuan to determine their current operations and future inland transport \nrequirements;  (vi) develop  plans  for  improving  railway  services  for  passengers  (including \ntourists)  and  freight  (particularly  container  services);  (vii) propose  measures  to  develop \nindustrial sidings; and (viii) improve the marketing of railway services to targeted customers, \nboth passenger and freight. The consultants will recommend actions and changes including \ninstitutional efforts and provide capacity development support to make the project company \nmore  market-oriented  and  competitive.  The  international  consultants  will  be  recruited  in \naccordance with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time).  \n \nC.  Expertise and Cost Estimates \n \n3.  About 8 person-months of international consulting services will be engaged through the \nsimplified  technical  proposal  procedures  based  on  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The provisions of the ADB \nanticorruption policy will be included in all invitation documents and contracts for international \nconsultants.  The  international  consultants  will  have  expertise  in  institutional  development, \nmarketing, international trade, and railway operation. The loan will finance the services of the \ninternational consultants and a capacity development program, if necessary. \n \n4.  The Ministry of Railways and the project company will (i) assign appropriate counterpart \nstaff  to  coordinate  with  and  facilitate  the  work  of  the  international  consultants;  (ii) provide \nsuitable office accommodation and communications facilities commensurate with requirements; \n(iii) assist  the  international  consultants  in  scheduling  field  visits  and  discussions  with  field \nagencies  in  connection  with  the  study;  and  (iv) provide  all  facilities,  documentation,  and \nassistance as may be reasonably requested by the international consultants to complete the \nwork. \n \n ", "   \nPROJECT PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM \n \n  Monitoring  Major Indicators to be Monitored  Monitoring  Accountable  Reporting Frequency \nTool  (Baseline and target figures to be incorporated into PAM)  Agency   Agency  Submission Due Date \n\u2022  Population, poverty incidence       \n\u2022  Infant mortality, maternal mortality, school enrollment  Project  MOR, project  Annually  \n\u2022  Number of hospitals or clinics  company  company   \n\u2022  Update of poverty reduction program of each county       \ny  \u2022  GDP, GDP share (primary, secondary and tertiary), GDP per capita       (up to 3 years after physical \nt\nbili Socioeconomic  \u2022  Station area land prices, local government revenue      completion) \na Monitoring  \u2022  Local price escalation, net income per capita       \nn\nai Report  \u2022  Fixed asset investment for roads        \nst   \u2022  Number of registered enterprises  Project  MOR, project   \nu\nS \u2022  Progress of development of local road network    company  company  The indicators will be \n\u2022  Road density by approximate distance from a station      collected for the following \n\u2022  Number of villages without roads, good drinking water, electricity,  groups: (i) sample on-route \ntelephone line   townships;

Traffic Forecast \n \n1.  Freight traffic for the Chongqing\u2013Lichuan Railway (CLR) was forecast by commodity \n(i.e.,  coal,  petroleum  products,  iron  and  steel,  fertilizers,  intermodal  containers,  and  other \ncommodities) in two categories differentiated by their economic impact: (i) traffic diverted from \nother modes (other railway routes, roads, and inland waterway) based on an assessment of the \nrelative service- and cost-competitiveness of the project railway; and (ii) generated traffic that \nwould only move because of the existence of a railway line where none previously existed. The \ntraffic  forecast  was  based  on  a  two-tier  analysis:  (i)  national  transport  demand  based  on \nhistorical trends correlating socioeconomic parameters, such as gross domestic product and \npropensity to travel or ship or demand for railway transport; (ii) national and regional railway \ntraffic demand based on commodity-specific analysis for major commodities currently using \n \nother  railway  lines,  roads,  and  inland  waterways. Traffic  projections  considered  expected \neconomic  growth,  population  increase,  tourism  development  potential,  local  government \ndevelopment plans, market surveys, and assessments of technical assistance consultants and \nAsian Development Bank missions. The freight volume on the CLR is forecast to increase from \nabout 7.16 billion ton-kilometers (ton-km) in 2014 to 20.13 billion ton-km in 2033, for an average \n \nannual growth rate of 5.9%.Passenger traffic is forecast to grow from 8.38 billion passenger-\nkilometers  (passenger-km)  in  2014  to  25.78  billion  passenger-km  in 2033,  for  an  average \nannual growth rate of 6.4% (Table A14.1). Traffic forecasts are considered reasonable, given \nthat (i) the CLR is an important link along the Chengdu\u2013Chongqing\u2013Shanghai transport corridor, \nconnecting western People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) with the east, as well as serving as a \ngateway to the PRC\u2013Eurasian rail network for intermodal transport; (ii) railways in the PRC have \nexperienced high annual traffic growth with recent rates higher than the assumed growth rates \nfor freight and passenger traffic; (iii) the existing parallel road within the project corridor is \ncongested  in  some  areas,  making  road  transport  expensive  and  hazardous;  and  (iv)  the \ndistance saved by routing traffic through CLR compared with other railway lines is up to 369 km \nin  origin\u2013destination  pairs  involving  long-distance  movement  between  eastern  and  western \nPRC.  \n \nB.   Economic Evaluation  \n2.  Analysis  of  Alternatives.  As  part  of  the  economic  analysis,  possible  alternative \ninterventions were considered, to meet the growing transport demand in the project area as part \nof the national and provincial transport network plan. Various options, in terms of transport \nmodes, alignments, and technical designs, were reviewed. While enhancing the existing road \ncapacity may be an option to partly meet the increasing demand, it will not completely satisfy \nthe various kinds of traffic, particularly bulk cargo such as coal over long distances to meet the \nneeds of a growing economy. Aside from the higher initial cost, increased land requirements, \nhigh air pollution, fuel consumption, and user costs make the road alternative less viable. \nMultiple alignment alternatives were subsequently evaluated for four line sections, considering \ngeologic  and  topographic  conditions,  terrain,  the  results  of  consultations  with  community \nrepresentatives, cost estimates, relative impact on the environment and resettlement, and the \nobjective of integration with the national and local transport network. The technical design was \nproposed after consideration of the national railway network, consistency in the standards of \ncontiguous sections at each end of the project railway, and forecast traffic.  \n \n3.  Cost. The economic evaluation is based on a comparison of with- and without-project \nscenarios,  using  constant  2008  economic  prices.  Under  the  without-project  scenario  it  is \nassumed  that  the  diverted  traffic  (27.3  million  tons  and  26.1  million  passengers  by  2014) \n ", "46   Appendix 14 \nestimated  under  the  with-project scenario  would  continue  moving  by  road  and  by  existing \nrailway lines. Furthermore, the generated traffic estimated under the with-project scenario (3.79 \nmillion  tons  and  16.41  million  passengers  by  2014)  would  not  materialize  under  the \nwithout-project scenario. The project benefits and cost were revalued in economic prices by \nseparating the cost items into tradable materials and equipment, non-tradable materials, labor, \nand land. The prices were expressed in yuan using the domestic price numeraire with a shadow \nexchange rate factor of 1.01 for foreign exchange effects. A shadow wage rate factor of 0.67 \nwas used to put an economic value on the wages paid to unskilled labor, but not on wages for \nskilled labor since no clear surplus of skilled workers exists.  \n \n4.  Benefits. Economic benefits include (i) user cost savings for freight and passenger \ntraffic; (ii) time savings for diverted passenger and freight traffic from buses, trucks, and other \nrail  lines;  (iii)  generated  passenger  and  freight  transport  benefits;  (iv)  tourism  benefits; \n(v) avoided road infrastructure and maintenance costs; (vi) shipper savings due to increased \nrailway competition; (vii) avoided road accidents; (viii) pollution reduction benefits; (ix) energy \nsavings; and (x) national productivity benefits.  \n \n5.  For passenger traffic diverted from road (3.38 million passengers in 2014), the user cost \nsaving (CNY53.74 million by 2014) is the difference in the passenger economic fare between \nroad and rail transport (CNY0.0003 per passenger-km). For passenger traffic diverted from \nother railway lines (22.72 million passengers by 2014), the user cost savings (CNY7.78 million \nby 2014) is the difference of route distance applied to the economic cost of rail passenger travel \n(CNY0.051 per passenger-km). For generated passenger traffic (both local and interline) the \npassenger-km estimate (2.46 billion by 2014) is multiplied by one-half of the average economic \ncost savings (CNY0.0004 per passenger-km). Passenger traffic time savings (CNY2.21 million \nby 2014) are computed only for diverted traffic.  \n \n6.  For freight traffic diverted from trucks (6.24 million tons by 2014), the economic benefit \n(CNY272.84 million by 2014) is the difference in shipper economic costs between truck and rail \ntransport (CNY0.193 per ton-km). For traffic diverted from other PRC railways routes to CLR, \nthe benefit is the rail-diverted ton-km (4.84 billion by 2014) applied to the same economic rate of \nrail transport (CNY0.0364 per ton-km). For freight traffic diverted from inland waterways (1.29 \nmillion tons by 2014), the economic benefit (CNY0.24 million by 2014) is the difference in \nshipper economic costs between inland waterway and rail transport (CNY0.0007 per ton-km). \nFor generated freight traffic benefits (CNY1,425.9 million by 2014) an adjusted economic value \nadded ranging from CNY565 per ton for non-containerized bulk cargo to CNY4,406 per ton for \ncontainerized cargo was computed on the basis of the current financial value, non-tax elements, \nshadow exchange rate factor, percentage of value added, percentage of net taxes, depreciation, \nand operating surplus for each commodity. The adjusted economic values per ton represent the \nnet economic value, i.e., the value of output at economic prices less the costs of production \n(sum of all intermediate input costs, including wages, and annualized investment costs). Similar \nto passenger traffic, freight traffic time savings (CNY0.34 million by 2014) are computed only for \ndiverted traffic. \n \n7.  Tourism benefits (CNY74.26 million by 2014) assume that 15% of generated interline \npassenger traffic growth (0.86 million by 2014) is attributable to CLR, which will generate a net \neconomic value of CNY95 per tourist, representing 16.9% of the value added in the tourism \nsector accounting for the value of output at economic prices less the cost of production (sum of \nall intermediate input costs, wages, and annualized investment costs). To eliminate double \ncounting, a downward adjustment of 15% of generated traffic benefits is made, reducing these \nbenefits by the same proportion as the percentage of tourists in projected interline passengers.  \n \n ", "  Appendix 14  47 \n8.  The construction of CLR will help avoid some costs that would not be possible in the \nabsence  of  CLR.  The  economic  analysis  estimated  four  such  cases  of  cost  avoidance: \n(i) avoided highway investment costs (initial investment of CNY191.21 million by 2014, with \nannual incremental investments ranging from CNY6.68 million by 2014 to CNY9.04 million by \n2033  to  accommodate  the  increased  traffic  every  year);  (ii)  avoided  highway  routine  and \nperiodic maintenance costs (CNY13.99 million by 2014, increasing to CNY31.81 million by \n2033); (iii) avoided truck shipping charges to freight shippers due to increased competition \nbrought about by CLR (CNY207.59 million by 2014, increasing to CNY524.57 by 2033); and \n(iv) avoided road accident costs (CNY110.43 million by 2014, increasing to CNY251.11 million \nby 2033).  \n \n9.  Energy  and  pollution  benefits  have  also  been  estimated  for  the  Project.  With  the \ndiversion of freight and passengers from road to rail, there will be benefits due to reduced \npollution from trucks, buses, and cars as well as less energy used by the transport sector. \nRecent research by the International Energy Agency was used as a basis for computing the \nnumber of tons of carbon dioxide (CO ) per traffic unit for road and rail for the PRC. These \n2\nsavings for rail compared with road were found to be 25.4 tons of CO  per million passenger-km \n2\nand 24 tons of CO  per million ton-km. Under the provisions of the Kyoto Protocol, certified \n2\nemission reductions are currently valued in the PRC at $16 per ton of carbon dioxide. This value \nhas been included in the benefit stream (CNY32.18 million by 2014, increasing to CNY96.93 \nmillion by 2033). In addition, the savings of reduced total fuel consumption (CNY204.0 million by \n2014; CNY605.03 million by 2033) as a result of the diversion of traffic from both road and rail to \nCLR has been computed and included in the benefit stream. Unit operating costs for both road \nand rail transport have been adjusted to exclude fuel costs in order to eliminate double counting \nof this benefit.  \n10.  Conclusion. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the Project is 16.7% (Table \nA14.3). Benefits from the freight traffic, including generated benefits, are the major economic \nbenefit  (approximately  55%),  with  passenger  benefits  contributing  about  3.3%  and  other \nbenefits making up the remaining balance. Sensitivity analysis tested 10 scenarios to assess \nthe robustness of the results of the economic analysis (Table A14.4). The initial capital cost \nwould have to be more than 60.0% higher than estimated for the EIRR to fall below the cutoff \nrate of 12%. Considering the experience of Asian Development Bank-financed projects in the \nrailway sector, this switching value is unlikely to occur. The freight benefits would have to \ndecrease  more  than  44%  to  make  the  Project  economically  nonviable.  A  1-year  delay  in \ncompletion does not affect economic viability. Combinations of adverse effects of benefits and \ncosts were also tested. The results showed that the Project would maintain its economic viability \nunder plausible scenarios of variability. \n \n11.  The economic analysis was extended to quantify project risk and distribute project net \nbenefits among stakeholders. The risk analysis considered the distribution of possible values for \nkey variables, including capital costs, operation and maintenance costs, passenger traffic, and \nfreight  traffic,  and  the  probability  with  which  they  may  occur.  The  results  show  that  the \nprobability of an EIRR falling below 12% would be 0.8%. Distribution analysis examined how \nproject  net  benefits  would  be  distributed  by  determining  the  project  effects  for  project \nbeneficiaries, such as passengers, freight shippers, labor, government, and the economy (Table \nA14.2). At 62.3% freight shippers would be the largest beneficiary group, followed by national \nand local economy at 17.0%, national and local government at 15.2%, passengers at 3.9%, and \nlabor at 1.6%.

15 \nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND ANALYSIS \n \nA.  General  \n1.  The projected financial statements of the proposed Chongqing\u2013Lichuan Railway Project \n(the Project) were prepared in current terms for 2009\u20132033. Construction will be completed by \nend-2014; the trial operation will follow for one year; and the full commercial operation will \ncommence in 2015. The cost estimates are presented in current terms. As required in the \nfinancial management guidelines physical contingencies (at the weighted average rate of 5.6%) \nand price contingencies1 had been provided.  \nB.  Financial Projections  \n2.  A set of tariffs was devised for freight and passenger transport service, based on full \ncost recovery plus an adequate return on equity. Operating revenues from tariffs are projected \nbased on forecast of future traffic and a base average tariff rate of CNY0.103 per ton-kilometer \nfor 2014 inclusive of Railway Construction Fund collections, which averages CNY0.033 per ton-\nkilometer.  The  freight  tariff  is  assumed  to  increase  at  a  rate  of  1%  annually  with  tariff \nadjustments taking place every five years. Similar to the freight tariff, passenger fares are \nassumed to increase in current terms once every 5 years at an annual rate of 1%. Passenger \ntariff ranges from CNY0.10 per passenger-km for local fast trains to CNY0.20 per passenger-km \nfor transit very fast trains in 2014 with a weighted average rate of CNY0.158 per passenger-km \nfor all passenger traffic. Other revenues, including loading and unloading, warehouse storage, \nparcel service in the train stations, amount to 4.5% of combined freight and passenger revenue.   \n3.   Annual incremental operating costs are estimated as follows: (i) fixed cost excluding \ndepreciation CNY0.326 million per route-kilometer in 2014 escalating at an average rate of 2.2% \nper year in current terms; (ii) passenger variable cost in 2014 of CNY0.035 per passenger-km \nexcluding  dry  lease  of  rolling  stock,  increasing  to  CNY0.037  per  passenger-km  in  2033; \n(iii) freight variable cost in 2014 of CNY0.029 per ton-km excluding dry lease of rolling stock, \nincreasing to CNY0.033 per ton-km in 2033; (iv) estimated cost of dry lease of rolling stock2 is \nCNY10.60 per train-km for passenger trains and CNY7.89 per train-km for freight trains; and \n(v) other  non-operating  expenses  are  assumed  at  CNY0.0025  per  traffic  unit  (ton-km  plus \npassenger-km). All incremental operating costs are projected to increase annually in line with \ninflation rates.  \n4.  Periodic track-laying maintenance and infrastructure rehabilitation will be required after \neach 7 years of operation at a cost of CNY3.05 million per route-km; electric power and \ncatenary will be replaced after 15 years of operation at a cost of CNY1,096.7 million, and \nsignaling and communications, safety and other equipment will be replaced after 20 years of \noperation at a cost of CNY832.5 million.  \n5.  The accounts receivable turnover period is assumed at 2 months of the annual revenue \nand 1 month of the total working expenses for accounts payable. The project company will \n                                                 \n1  Local inflation rate 5% for 2009 and thereafter; foreign inflation rate 0.7% for 2009, 1.4% in 2010, 0.4% in 2011, \nand 0.5% per year thereafter. \n2  Rolling stock consists of a fleet of freight and passenger trains, which will not be specifically assigned to the CLR. \nMOR will separately finance the procurement of rolling stock and charge a fee based on train-kilometer (km) to \nCLR and other railways. The per-km rate will be based on dry-lease terms and will include depreciation charges \n(20-year economic life with 4% scrap value) and 8% return on investment. \n ", "Appendix 15  51\nemploy 3,700 employees in 2014. The average annual wages and fringe benefits in 2014 are \nCNY30,000 per employee escalating at 3% per year.   \n6.  Depreciation is calculated on a straight line method with an average life of 65 years for \nthe main railway structure, 10 years for track, 45 years for buildings, 15 years for electric power \nand traction, and 20 years for signaling and communications and safety and other equipment \nand facilities. Applicable business taxes at an average rate of 3.24% are charged on revenue. \nCorporate income tax at 33% is paid on income after deducting business taxes, depreciation \nand interest charges, operating expenses, and any prior year losses carried forward.   \n7.  The Project will be funded 50% by equity (70% and 30%, respectively by Ministry of \nRailways and Chongqing Municipal Government) and 50% by long-term loans. The China \nConstruction Bank (CCB) loan (CNY10.00 billion bearing interest at 6.6% per year) will be \nrepayable over 20 years, including a 5-year grace period. The ADB loan $150 million (CNY1.08 \nbillion) will have a 26-year term including a 6-year grace period, and be a US dollar London \ninterbank offered rate-based loan with a 0.15% commitment fee. Projected financial statements \nare presented in Table A15.1 to Table A15.3 The projected financial statements indicate that the \nforecast revenue under the base assumptions are sufficient to cover annual recurrent costs, \ndepreciation, debt repayments on the ADB and CCB loans, and generate reasonable profits.  \nC.  Financial Analysis   \n8.  Following are the major assumptions used for calculation of a financial internal rate of \nreturn (FIRR): (i) all calculations are based on 2008 prices, covering 2009\u20132033; (ii) capital \ncosts include all incremental capital expenditures related to construction and equipment for the \nrailway, but exclude price contingencies and interest during construction; (iii) operating costs \ninclude all annual incremental expenses incurred in operating the project railway, but exclude \ndepreciation and debt repayment provisions; (iv) the residual value equal to one-half of the net \nbook value of capital investment.   \n9.  The estimated weighted average cost of capital (WACC), after-tax, in real terms was \ncalculated using estimated capital mix and cost of funds. Costs have been considered as \nfollows: (i) the applicable 5-year London interbank offered rate fixed swap rate plus a provision \nfor ADB\u2019s spread of 0.2% is used for ADB debt; (ii) the estimated interest rate of 6.6% per \nannum is used for the CCB loan; and (iii) the opportunity cost of equity capital was assumed to \nbe 8%. The cost of debt is also adjusted to reflect the impact of income tax of 33%. The nominal \ncost is converted to the real cost by applying domestic and international long-term inflation rates \nfor local currency and foreign exchange denominated debt, respectively.   \n10.  The FIRR for the Project, computed on an after-tax basis, is 5.48% (Table A15.4), which \ncompares favorably with the WACC, computed at an after-tax basis at 2.80%. The Project is \nconsidered both financially viable and sustainable. Sensitivity tests indicate conditions causing \nthe Project's viability to fall below the WACC are unlikely to occur. The switching values show \nthat the financial viability of the project is not altered within a realistic range of variation in key \nparameter estimates.

No    No \npartnership agreement?   \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC): \nBetter railway transport will enable poverty reduction through improved access to markets, employment, advanced \neducation and medical facilities, new knowledge and information, families working or studying in other regions, and other \nsocial and economic services, and facilitate economic development and job creation. Improved access to markets opens \nup opportunities for expansion of locally produced goods and services. Incoming passengers and tourists generate \nadditional demand for locally produced goods and services.  \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                            Targeting Classification: General Intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \nMany villages located toward the eastern half of the alignment have been relatively isolated from these developments, \nand these are where the very poor live. The links between poverty, topography, and transport systems are apparent in \nthe project impact area. The main causes of poverty in the project areas are (i) natural calamity, (ii) lack of infrastructure, \n(iii) very limited and unsustainable source of livelihood, (vi) uneven economic development, and (v) poor health. The \nProject will benefit about 5.5 million people in the project area; 3.6 million are in the countryside, and 590,000 of these \n(16.4%) are poor. There are 681 designated poverty villages in the project impact area\u201431.6% of all villages in the \narea\u2014and they are largely concentrated in the four poorest counties. About 14% of the people in the project impact area \nare ethnic minorities, almost all of them living in the Shizhu\u2013Tujia Autonomous County and the neighboring Lichuan \ncounty. \n \nAbout 119,000 unskilled person-years of work will be created during the construction of the railway. Half of the unskilled \nwork, with total wages of CNY0.89 billion, will be targeted at the poor. Priority will be given to women, people affected by \nresettlement, ethnic minorities, and other vulnerable people. In addition, during the construction, 44,142 person-years of \nlocal unskilled jobs in the provision of construction materials will be created, with total wages of CNY0.4 billion; half of this \ntotal will be targeted at the poor. When the new railway starts to operate in 2014, about 3,530 jobs involving working for \nChongqing\u2013Lichuan Railway will be created. The local governments are responsible for providing social services and \npoverty reduction funds for county poverty alleviation planning; their programs will be augmented by the railway \nconstruction tax revenues.  \n \nThe Project\u2019s railway stations will create various jobs, and help distribute the benefits to local people. There will be \nsufficient space in and around the stations for local area development, and the poor, women, ethnic groups, and other \nvulnerable people will be supported by local governments in setting up shop and selling local specialties and other goods \nand services. The jobs created by the generated freight will total 34,909 jobs by 2014. Increased tourism will result in the \ncreation of 1,003 jobs by 2014. Directly as well as indirectly, therefore, the Project will improve conditions in support of the \nPRC\u2019s strategy of micro-urbanization for poor families to (i) encourage them to move out of unsustainable, mountainous, \nand isolated farmlands; (ii) give them better access to markets, and advanced educational and health facilities especially \nfor pregnant women; and (iii) allow them to build a sustainable future in new centers of economic activity. The Project will \ncomplement the poverty reduction activities of the local governments, such as assisting the poor with urban migration, \nrelocation, employment, local economic development, farmer-based rural tourism, agricultural product development, and \nhealth and physical infrastructure and natural resources improvement. These concerted efforts will promote further \nprogress toward the Millennium Development Goals in the project areas, especially Goals 1 and 3\u20137. \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes                     No  \nVarious public consultation and participation activities for the Project have been carried out, including 48 village surveys \nand over 1,700 household surveys. The Ministry of Railways (MOR) and project planners have had formal and informal \nconsultations with local communities and government agencies through meetings, surveys, household interviews, written \ncommunications, and workshops. Local governments and communities will be responsible for organizing local labor for \nthe construction. The station area developments will encourage participation, to the benefit of the poor, women, ethnic \nminorities, and other vulnerable people. Among the issues discussed was the selection of the line, route and sand and \nstone supply.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \nLocal people\u2019s participation will be essential for improving their opportunities to benefit from the Project. Local groups and \nrelevant government agencies will continue to be involved in the consultation and participation process, especially during \nthe  implementation  of  the  environmental  management  and  monitoring  plan,  and  the  resettlement  plan.  Railway \nconstruction support offices have been set up in each project county, and they will have copies of all relevant documents. \nDuring construction and operation, they will serve as key coordinating points to enhance the participation of stakeholders, \nincluding the poor, women, ethnic groups, and other vulnerable people. Leading groups have been formed at the local \n ", "  Appendix 16  57 \ngovernment level; these include development and reform commissions; finance, land and resources, environment \nprotection, industry and tourism, and poverty reduction offices; the All-China Women\u2019s Federation (ACWF); and health, \nlabor, civil affairs, and ethnic affairs groups. These leading groups will continue the process of consultation and \nparticipation and coordinate activities by various agencies to ensure local benefits. A social development action plan \n(SDAP) has been prepared and endorsed by MOR and the local governments. It will be implemented and monitored to \nensure the participation of local people in project activities and benefits. \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nDuring project preparation, analyses of gender-disaggregated data and discussions with representatives of the ACWF \nindicated that women will need some assistance to fully benefit from the Project. Data collected for the poverty and social \nassessment and the resettlement plan indicate the following: (i) women primarily engage in agricultural activities; and \n(ii) male members from poor households tend to travel farther for migrant labor opportunities than non-poor males, \nleaving behind a high percentage of households headed by women. The construction of the railway would create \nopportunities for local area development, and many of the service sector jobs, especially in the tourism sector, seek \nwomen employees. The ACWF will provide business management and financial assistance to women interested in \nsetting up small businesses that serve the construction crews and the growing tourist sector.  In addition, as women will \nhave a greater exposure to the risk of HIV/AIDS/STIs and human trafficking, the mitigation measures will pay special \nattention to women.  \n \nPoverty  and  social  enhancement  measures  have  been  built  into  the  project  design,  and  special  mitigation  or \nenhancement actions have been included in the resettlement plan and SDAP. For example, members of the community \nwill collectively decide where schools will be relocated. Women, especially female heads of households, will be consulted \nas schools provide an informal source of day care for their children. Poor women heads of households will receive \nassistance so that their children can remain in school, freeing the women\u2019s time during the day to work.  Widows will be \neligible for special assistance, if necessary, during land acquisition and resettlement. Women will be given priority in \nproject-generated employment during the construction and operation of the railway. The rise in female participation in the \nlabor force and tourism market will increase women\u2019s net income, thus improving family welfare, and raising the status of \nwomen. \n \nHas an output been prepared?                        Yes (see SDAP)     No \nE.

The project railway alignment is 259.3 kilometers (km) long and will cross 29 townships \nand 84 villages in the seven districts or counties of Chongqing municipality and Hubei province. \nThe resettlement plan addresses the permanent and temporary impact of the railway alignment, \nstation  sites,  station  access  roads,  and  related  construction  activities.  An  estimated \n711 hectares of land will be permanently acquired; of this, 62.3% is farmland (10.4% paddy land, \n41.7% cultivated dryland, 10.2% garden plots), 37.1 % is forestland, and 0.6% is land put to \nother use. Given the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) standard for impact assessment, the \nequivalent of 5,283 people would theoretically lose all their farmland and agricultural livelihoods. \nSince the alignment is a narrow strip of land, most of the affected persons will lose only a small \npart of their landholding. From experience, the average loss is estimated at 15%; this means \nthat the number of partially affected people would be in the order of 35,000, and that those \nlosing more than 10% would be about 14,000. The accurate number of those affected will be \navailable after the detailed measurement surveys along the approved alignment. The Project \nwill  temporarily  occupy  674 hectares  during  construction.  Also,  an  estimated \n391,000 square meters  of  structures\u201486%  residential  structures,  and  14%  factory  and \ninstitutional structures\u2014will be demolished. The demolition of 1,715 houses will require the \nrelocation of 5,314 persons. Land acquisition and house demolition impact will be reduced by \naligning the railway and stations away from the most densely populated areas (by constructing \nbridges and tunnels, which account for 83%), after consultations with communities.  \n \n2.  The Ministry of Railways (MOR), in conjunction with local governments, prepared the \nresettlement plan. It is based on: the feasibility study; village surveys of 48 affected villages; \n337 additional  household  surveys;  and  consultations  with  provincial,  prefecture,  and  local \nofficials, village leaders, and affected households. The resettlement objective is to ensure that \ncompensation  and  entitlements  provided  to  affected  persons  are  adequate  for  at  least \nmaintaining their \u201cwithout-project\u201d standard of living, with prospects of improvement\u2014in line with \nthe PRC Land Administration Law, 2004, and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Involuntary \nResettlement Policy (1995) and Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). \n \n3.  The resettlement plan stipulates eligibility and entitlement provisions for affected people. \nPermanent land losses will be compensated by cash payments. Each rural village will use the \nland compensation and resettlement subsidy for income restoration. The main strategies for \nincome restoration include improvement of irrigation systems, development of animal husbandry \nand cash crops, small-business development, and migration to urban centers for employment. \nCompensation for temporary land loss will be paid directly to the people affected to offset any \nincome loss; the land will also be restored by the contractor to its original state after use. \nCompensation for rural housing losses will be paid directly to those affected at replacement \ncost, free of demolition expenses and salvaged materials. The displaced rural houses will be \nrebuilt within the existing village or integrated with the suburban development plan. Better road \naccess and provision of site leveling, water supply, electricity, telephone, and cable facilities will \nbe provided. Urban households, factories, schools and other institutions, and enterprises will be \npaid compensation for relocation and reconstruction based on market rates determined through \nnegotiations.  Urban  households  can  select  new  housing,  which  is  widely  available.  Most \nfactories will only suffer partial impact and continue operations at the same site. For factories \nrequired to relocate, each owner will prepare a relocation plan, which includes the restoration of \nlivelihood and incomes for all workers. Schools and other institutions will be rebuilt according to \nthe plans of local government, to ensure that service levels are maintained or improved. \n \n4.  The resettlement impact of the railway project is spread thinly over a long, narrow \ncorridor.  Investigations  showed  that  income  loss  from  land  acquisition  will  be  less  severe \n ", "  Appendix 17  59 \nbecause this corridor is developing rapidly and at least 70% of net income for more than half of \nrural  households  comes  from  nonagricultural  employment  and  small  businesses.  Special \nassistance will be provided to any seriously affected villages and groups, especially vulnerable \nhouseholds that include the poor, widows, and disabled persons. Ethnic minorities (primarily \nTujia) account for 14% of the project beneficiaries and less than 10% of affected persons. Some \nof Tujia households have successfully transitioned into the PRC\u2019s economy, while others have \nremained poor, albeit with improved living conditions. Where they are poor, this is due to the \nlimited  resources  available  in  the  area  to  all  residents  and  inability  to  take  advantage  of \nopportunities. Special measures are included in the resettlement plan to ensure that they are \nadequately rehabilitated and that their living standards improve.  \n \n5.  Local  government  land  administration  bureaus  will  be  responsible  for  implementing \nresettlement; many activities will be carried out by township officials and village committees. \nMOR and the local governments have extensive experience, and they integrate resettlement \nwith project implementation through railway construction support offices, which have already \nbeen set up. Local government will provide training to local officials who will be involved in \nimplementation. The training will focus on ADB requirements, as specified in the resettlement \nplan, and new domestic procedures. Affected persons have been informed and consulted about \nthe project impact and resettlement policies and entitlements at various stages. Resettlement \ninformation  booklets  have  been  distributed  to  affected  villages.  Affected  households  will \ncontinue to be consulted and are encouraged to participate in resettlement activities, including \nthe detailed measurement survey, location of underpasses, new housing sites, and grievance \nredress. \n \n6.  Affected households will receive training and skills development assistance that will \nfacilitate income-generating activities. Other assistance, such as preferential hiring of affected \npersons by construction companies and access to credit, will also be provided. Local poverty \nalleviation programs provide a valuable source of additional assistance to vulnerable groups \nand they will be targeted during the implementation of the resettlement plan. In addition, the \nprovinces  have  established  programs  that  directly  benefit  affected  villages  and  persons. \nChongqing has a very active village development program that provides infrastructure and funds \nfor rural enterprise development that will be doubled during the Eleventh Five-Year Plan.  \n \n7.  The total resettlement cost for the Project is CNY541.35 million, including taxes and \ncontingencies. The Chongqing municipal government will finance the resettlement cost for its \nsection of the railway and MOR will finance the section in Lichuan. Both have guaranteed to \nsupplement  the  resettlement  budget,  as  may  prove  necessary,  to  meet  any  shortfall.  An \nimplementation schedule based on MOR\u2019s project construction timetable has been prepared. \nLand acquisition and housing demolition for the railway component would commence in the first \nquarter of 2009, and the work on new stations would start much later. The Project is expected to \nbe completed in 2014. \n \n8.  MOR, through the project company, and the local governments, through the railway \nconstruction  support  offices,  will  be  responsible  for  internal  supervision  and  monitoring  of \ncompensation payments, house rebuilding and relocation, land redistribution, and grievance \nredress. MOR and the local governments have extensive experience in land acquisition and \nresettlement, and this experience is expected to facilitate resettlement implementation for the \nProject.  MOR  will  prepare  progress  reports  and  submit  them  to  ADB  each  quarter,  until \nresettlement  is  completed.  MOR  will  then  prepare  a  resettlement  completion  report  for \nsubmission to ADB. In addition, MOR will contract an independent monitor to carry out external \nmonitoring and evaluation. The tasks include (i) conducting a baseline survey; (ii) reviewing and \nverifying the compensation payments, status of land acquisition, and compensation payments; \n ", "60  Appendix 17 \n(iii) assessing grievance redress procedures, and the affected persons\u2019 opinions and level of \nsatisfaction; (iv) assessing the restoration of affected persons\u2019 livelihood, incomes, and living \nconditions; and (v) compiling the lessons learned for future resettlement planning. The external \nmonitor will prepare monitoring reports for submission to MOR and ADB every 6 months until \nthe completion of the resettlement activities; thereafter, annual evaluation investigations will be \nconducted  for  at  least  2  years  and  reported  to  MOR  and  ADB.
