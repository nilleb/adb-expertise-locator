THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed senior \nsecured debt financing of up to $60,000,000 (in Indian rupee equivalent) to Aavas Financiers \nLimited (Aavas) for the Supporting Access to Housing Finance for Women in Lower-Income \nGroups and in Lagging States Project in India. \n \n2.  The Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) longer-tenor debt financing will provide housing \nloans targetting women borrowers in economically weaker sections (EWS) and low-income \ngroups (LIGs).1 At least 75% of the debt proceeds will be onlent to borrowers in select lagging \nstates of India.2  \n \nII.  THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n \n3.  Affordable housing and housing finance. Limited housing supply adversely affects the \nliving conditions of lower-income households, especially in large cities characterized by low \nbuilding standards. The shortage of housing units in India is estimated at 18.7 million in urban \nareas and 43.7 million in rural areas.3 More than 90% of this deficit is estimated to be in the \naffordable housing segment, primarily classified as EWS and LIG. A large number of urban lower-\nincome families, with a monthly household income of \u20b910,000\u2013\u20b925,000, can afford privately built \nhousing costing \u20b9400,000\u2013\u20b91 million. This customer segment needs an estimated 15 million \nhomes, which translates into a funding need of \u20b97 trillion.4 The Government of India launched the \nPradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) initiative in 2015, with a target of building 20 million \naffordable homes for the urban poor, including the EWS and LIG categories, by 2022.5 To date, \nabout 8.4 million homes have been authorized.6 Under the PMAY, the government offers interest \nrate subsidies of 3.0%\u20136.5%, depending on the loan amount and the income category of the \nborrower, and other measures to incentivize the supply of affordable housing. \n \n4.  Finance  sector  overview.  Banks  dominate  the  finance  sector,  with  the  assets  of \ncommercial banks totaling 75.0% of financial system assets.7 Public sector banks (PSBs) have \n65.8% of all banking assets, but are facing tighter capital constraints with an average leverage \n \n1  Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation (MoHUA). 2017. Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna (PMAY). The \nMoHUA\u2019s definition for EWS is family income of less than \u20b90.3 million per annum; family income of between \u20b90.3 \nmillion\u2013\u20b90.6 million per annum qualifies as an LIG; and the middle-income group has family income of above \u20b90.6 \nmillion and less than \u20b91.8 million per annum. For this report and recommendation of the President, lower-income \nhouseholds refer to EWS and LIGs. \n2  Lagging states have a higher poverty incidence or lower per capita income than the national average, or have special \nstatus as defined by the Government of India. Special Status is a classification given by the Government of India to \ncertain states that face geographical and socio-economic disadvantages such as hilly terrains, strategic international \nborders, economic and infrastructural backwardness, and non-viable state finances. For this project, the lagging \nstates are Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Nagaland, Odisha, Rajasthan, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh, \nand West Bengal. \n3  M. Jena. 2016. U.N.

Gross nonperforming assets (NPAs) for the banking system declined to 9.3% in \nfiscal year (FY) 2019 from 11.5% in FY2018 and 9.6% in FY2017. The NPAs of private sector \nbanks (3.7%) and nonbank financial companies (NBFCs, 6.6%) reflected better performance than \nthat of PSBs (NPAs of 12.6%) in FY2019. NBFCs serve segments that typically are not catered \nto by banks. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had 9,659 NBFCs registered in FY2019. The NBFC \nsector has generally performed well; however, it has experienced tightening liquidity beginning in \nSeptember  2018  due  to  defaults  of  certain  high  profile  NBFCs,  including  housing  finance \ncompanies (HFCs).8 Despite the size of the banking industry, poor access to financial services \nremains a key issue in India, with 20.1% of people unbanked.9 Access to credit is even more \nlimited, with less than 7.0% of borrowers accessing credit via formal channels.10 \n \n5.  Housing finance sector. Given borrowers\u2019 constrained access to credit and the limited \navailability of long-term funds for financial institutions offering home loans, mortgage penetration \nin India was only 10.0% in FY2018\u2014much lower than in other emerging markets such as the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (18.0%), Thailand (20.0%), and Malaysia (34.0%).11 Most commercial \nbanks provide mortgage lending, but the affordable housing segment has not been a primary \ntarget as banks have concentrated on salaried employees in urban areas. HFCs are a significant \nplayer in mortgage financing, representing a 37.0% market share. Regulated by the RBI, the 77 \nHFCs are solely mandated to fund housing.12 The volume of HFC housing loans outstanding, \nincluding loans against property (LAPs), totaled \u20b920.9 trillion in December 2018, up by an \nannualized rate of 15.6% since March 2018. With an NPA ratio of 1.1% (FY2018), the asset quality \nof HFCs exceeded that of banks. However, rural-focused HFCs targeting low-income segment \nhousehold incomes of less than \u20b90.2 million had an NPA ratio of 12.4% (FY2018) and those with \nincomes of \u20b90.2 million\u2013\u20b90.5 million had an NPA ratio of 4.7% (FY2018). The higher level of stress \nin these segments is likely to be attributed to improper assessment of borrower debt service \ncapacity and high loan\u2013value (LTV) ratios. \n \n6.  Underserved  home  loan  borrower  segments.  Lower-income  households  are \nparticularly constrained in obtaining mortgages because of the lack of documents to prove their \nincome source, high credit evaluation costs, and perceived higher credit risk. As a result, such \nhouseholds typically fund their homes through savings, borrowings from family and friends, or \nloans from local moneylenders at usurious interest rates. Women in this income group find it \nparticularly difficult to obtain mortgage loans to meet their housing needs, as men dominate land \nand home ownership. A survey of land ownership carried out by ADB in northern and eastern \nIndia indicated that women owned only 3.6% of plots, while men represented the vast majority \n(85.9%) and the remaining 10.5% were untitled.13 Lack of property ownership directly contributes \n \n8  In September 2018, IL&FS, a large infrastructure development and finance conglomerate, defaulted on its payment \nobligations. The default was due to asset-liability maturity mismatches on the company\u2019s books which worsened due \nto delays in project execution. This led to a crunch in the supply of liquidity in the market which impacted the entire \nNBFC sector. Following a persistent liquidity crunch, Dewan Housing Finance Ltd. (DHFL), one of the largest housing \nfinance companies, also defaulted on its payments in June 2019. DHFL has significant exposure to real estate \ndevelopers \u2013 a sector that is in the middle of a prolonged slowdown and was also heavily dependent on short-term \ndebt, both factors resulted in liquidity issues for the company. More recently, in September 2019, Altico, a NBFC \nfocused on real estate financing also defaulted on interest payments for bank loan due to liquidity shortfalls. \n9  The level of unbanked people in India declined from 65% in 2011 to 20% in 2017 after the government launched the \nPradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana scheme, aiming to open 100 million bank accounts for poor families. \n10 World Bank. Financial Inclusion Data/Global Findex: India (accessed 9 September 2019). According to the World \nBank\u2019s Findex report (2018), only 8% of males and 5% of females over the age of 15 are reported to have borrowed \nfrom a financial institution. \n11 Housing Finance Information Network.

Female \naccess to finance in India is also extremely low, with only 5.0% of women reported to have \nborrowed from a formal financial institution and only 3.0% having an outstanding housing loan.15 \n \n7.  Rationale. To address the need to improve affordable housing finance, particularly for \nwomen and lower-income households, ADB identified HFC partners that have demonstrated the \nability to reach such households on a sustainable basis. While ADB has provided funding to HFCs \nin India in the past,16 the proposed project targets lower-income EWS and LIG segments (footnote \n1) than the previous loans and focuses entirely on female borrowers. Aavas, an HFC based in \nRajasthan, targets the lower-income EWS and LIG segments in rural and small towns classified \nas Tier II and below.17 Some 83% of Aavas loans are to lower-income households,18 65% of \nclients are self-employed, and 44.4% are first-time borrowers from formal financial institutions. \nWith women representing 58.8% of primary borrowers and nearly all remaining loans having \nwomen as co-borrowers, Aavas has a very strong footprint in servicing women. Aavas has \ndemonstrated successful business growth, led by experienced senior managers and supported \nby strong middle management. Its robust risk management entails a strong presence of credit \nofficers at its branches. Aavas proved the strength of its prudent operations and risk management \nfollowing demonetization in November 2016, where it was able to maintain strong asset quality, \nsignificantly better than most of its peers. Using technology and automated processes enables \nAavas to have efficient and cost-effective loan sourcing, approval, and monitoring as it scales its \nbusiness across 10 states and seeks to empower more women property owners. The proposed \nproject will support the growth of Aavas from its strong presence in western India toward more \nchallenging, less serviced regions.  \n \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy \n \n8.  Overview. Aavas was incorporated as Au Housing Finance Private Limited (Au Housing) \nin February 2011 and began operations in March 2012. It started as a fully owned subsidiary of \nAu Financiers, an NBFC that converted to a small finance bank (SFB) in 2017.19 Associated with \nits licensing as an SFB, Au Financiers sold Au Housing to private equity investors Kedaara \nCapital, Partners Group ESCL, and Partners Group Private Equity (Master Fund), LLC in 2016. \nIn March 2017, the company name was changed to Aavas Financiers Limited.  \n \n \n14 International Center for Research on Women. 2008.

ADB approved a $75 million loan to Au Financiers in October 2016. \n ", "4 \n9.  Aavas operates 210 branches across 10 states, reaching close to 900 Tehsils20. Most of \nAavas\u2019 business (about 89.5%) has focused on the states of Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Gujarat, \nand Madhya Pradesh, with Rajasthan contributing 44.0% of its assets under management (AUM) \nas at the end of FY2019. The company mainly offers housing loans (78.6%), while 21.4% of loans \nwere LAPs to fund businesses and top-up loans for personal use. The average loan size is \u20b90.86 \nmillion, and more than 90.0% of its loans totaled less than \u20b91.5 million ($21,067) in FY2019, while \n83.0% of the loans represented lower-income households. The average contractual tenor of loans \nis 15 years, but the weighted average life of the loan is 7.5 years because of prepayments.  \n \n10.  Business strategy. Since its foundation, Aavas has become the largest HFC in the \naffordable housing segment holding \u20b959.4 billion in AUM (FY2019) with a market share of 6.8%.21 \nAavas will continue to focus on non-salaried lower income customers, penetrating deeper into the \n10 states with existing operations, especially in districts with low mortgage penetration. From its \nbase  in  Rajasthan,  Aavas  has  gradually  expanded  into  the  adjacent  states  of  Gujarat, \nMaharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, and Uttarakhand. \nThe company will continue to focus on home loans and self-construction home loans, with a cap \nof 25.0% on loans for non-housing purposes. \n \nC.  Ownership, Management, and Governance \n \n11.  Ownership. As of 31 March 2019, Aavas\u2019 promoters included private equity investors \nLake District (34.3%), Partners Group ESCL (16.7%), and Partners Group Private Equity (Master \nFund), LLC. (7.3%). AU Small Finance Bank held 7.2%, while other institutional investors, the \npublic, and employees held the remaining 34.5%. Integrity due diligence was conducted.22 Some \n41.7% of shares are with non-promoter and no single investor holds more than 10.0%. While the \nshares held by the three private equity funds are not permitted to disclose details of their investors, \nADB has received written confirmation that anti-money laundering and combating the financing \nof terrorism checks have been conducted in compliance with relevant statutory requirements.23 \nTwo members of the board of directors are politically exposed persons, having served as directors \nin state-owned entities, but they do not appear to be subjects of any adverse media. ADB\u2019s review \nof the relevant entities does not give cause to believe they were established or are being used for \ncross-border tax evasion, money laundering, or terrorism financing.  \n  \n12.  Governance structure. Aavas\u2019 board has nine members, including three independent \ndirectors, five nominee directors, and the chief executive officer. The chair of the board is an \nindependent director. The board members have experience across the financial services sector, \nincluding with large PSBs, private equity firms, and commercial banks. The audit committee has \na majority of independent directors and the nomination and remuneration committees have equal \nnumber of independent and non-executive nominee directors. Aavas\u2019 statutory auditor is S. R. \nBatliboi & Associates, an EY associate.

Rawat has more than 2 decades of experience \nin managing treasury operations across various organizations. Naresh has worked extensively in \nfinancial services and allied sectors. Atre worked at Equitas Housing Finance, ICICI Bank and \nCholamandalam before joining Aavas.  \n \n14.  Risk management. Aavas\u2019 risk management framework and limits are set by its board of \ndirectors,  supported  by  risk  management,  audit,  and  asset  liability  management  (ALM) \ncommittees. The committees are mandated to supervise and identify current and emerging risks, \ndevelop  risk  assessment  systems,  monitor  control  mechanisms,  and  monitor  defined  risk \ntolerance limits. \n \n15.  Credit risk. Aavas has a standardized credit approval process that entails customer \nselection criteria, credit risk, and cash flow analysis for quality customers. The most heavily \nweighted factors in the credit process include cash flow analysis based on the employment profile \nof the borrower; the Bureau  score; the quality of the property mortgaged; the loan amount; and \nthe  LTV  ratio.24 Credit  exposures,  limits,  and  asset  quality  are regularly  monitored  by  the \nmanagement. Almost all loans fund owner-occupied dwellings; Aavas does not fund builders. \nCredit review is segregated from the sales operations and the ratio of risk to sales officers is \nstrong at 1.0:2.5. \n \n16.  Portfolio monitoring and collections. The company maintains a comprehensive system \nof internal controls, with key backup procedures and continuity plans. The internal audit team \nensures compliance with controls and processes. Aavas also studies the behavior of declined \ncustomers to enhance its loan approval process. The credit team receives daily updates on any \noverdue payments for all loans underwritten within 18 months. Aavas uses predictive analytics to \nidentify probable late payment cases in advance and to trigger prompt action by its collections \nteam.  \n \nD.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance \n \n17.  The ADB assistance consists of a senior secured debt facility of up to $60 million \nequivalent in Indian rupees with a tenor of up to 8 years. The ADB financing will be in the form of \nnonconvertible debentures with an exclusive legal charge on the security provided. 25 ADB may \nenter into risk transfers with eligible counterparties for a portion of the exposure. \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  Use of proceeds. Aavas will use the proceeds of ADB\u2019s facility to provide housing finance \nto EWS, LIG and MIG households. The entire ADB loan amount will be onlent to women as \nprimary borrowers or as co-borrowers. At least 75% of the loan proceeds will be used in selected \nlagging states.  \n \n24 TransUnion CIBIL Limited is a credit information bureau operating in India. The bureau maintains credit files on \nindividuals and businesses and provides scores that can be used to assess the creditworthiness of the borrower. \n25 A nonconvertible debenture is a debt security with a fixed rate of interest and specified tenor, which is not convertible \nto equity. The security includes eligible receivables, which meet the following criteria: (i) in the \u201cstandard\u201d or \nequivalent category under the borrower\u2019s asset classification system and (ii) that have not been restructured. \n ", "6 \n19.  Reporting arrangements. ADB will monitor the project throughout its duration.26 Aavas \nwill report to ADB on regular intervals with (i) quarterly unaudited financial statements, (ii) annual \naudited  financial  statements,  (iii)  quarterly  loan  portfolio  and  covenant  reports,  (iv)  annual \ndevelopment indicators agreed between ADB and Aavas, (v) annual reports on safeguards and \nsocial protection compliance, and (vi) annual progress report on the implementation of the gender \naction plan (GAP). \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n20.  Access to housing for underserved segments and women. India\u2019s mortgage markets \nare still underdeveloped and lower-income segments lack access to mortgage finance. Housing \nis also a strong contributor to employment. According to an ADB study, \u20b910 million invested in \nconstruction creates 22,000 unskilled, 23,000 skilled and semi-skilled, and 9,000 managerial and \ntechnical person work-days in India.27 As up to 40% of Indian homes in  urban areas are \nnonpermanent, this transaction targets extending access to affordable permanent quality housing \nto lower-income segments, representing an inclusive business model. As a result of the project, \nthe market for housing loans and improved houses will be also extended towards women and \npeople in lagging states. \n \n21.  Access to longer-tenor local currency debt. Aavas has an ongoing need for long-term \ndebt  financing  to  respond  to  the  demand  for  affordable  mortgages  targeting  low-income \nhouseholds. Aavas\u2019 assets have a legal maturity of 15 years at origination and 7.5 years (after \nprepayment), requiring long-tenor debt financing to ensure a prudent ALM. NBFCs and HFCs \nmust also diversify funding to maintain adequate liquidity, particularly given the current tight \nliquidity conditions.  \n \nD.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nIV.

According to ADB\u2019s India country partnership \nstrategy, 2018\u20132022, ADB\u2019s nonsovereign operations will continue to support the finance sector.29 \nThe project will also support access to affordable housing in lagging states, in line with the PMAY \ninitiative. The project is also aligned with ADB\u2019s Gender Equality and Women\u2019s Empowerment \nOperational Plan, 2013\u20132020.30 \n \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n26.  ADB  has  categorized  the  investment  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement  (2009).The  loan\u2019s  potential  environmental  and  social  (E&S)  impacts,  the  risks \nassociated with the borrower\u2019s existing and/or likely future portfolio, and its commitment and \ncapacity for E&S management have been assessed by ADB. \n \n27.  Category FI (treated as C). Aavas\u2019 business activities have minimal or no adverse \nenvironmental  impacts  and  are  unlikely  to  entail  impacts  on  involuntary  resettlement  and \nindigenous peoples. Aavas will (i) apply ADB's prohibited investment activities list; (ii) exclude \nactivities with category A and B environment and social safeguard impacts; (iii) ensure that \ninvestments using ADB funds comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and abide by \napplicable national laws and regulations, including labor laws, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection \nStrategy; and (iv) take measures to comply with internationally recognized core labor standards. \nAavas will confirm this in its periodic report to ADB and need not apply any other specific \nsafeguard or social requirements. ADB has categorized the investment in compliance with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009) as FI treated as C for impacts on the environment, involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples, and need not apply any other specific requirements. \n \n28.  Environmental and social safeguards. Aavas will not finance real estate development \nor mass housing construction, and targets lower-income and women home borrowers. Aavas\u2019 \ncurrent portfolio generally falls within the environment category C classification, wherein the \nexisting loans or subloans are likely to have minimal or no adverse environmental impacts. The \nclimate change impact from the project is expected to be low because of the nature and scale of \nloans that may be financed by the ADB loan proceeds. No land acquisition, physical or economic \ndisplacement, or impact on indigenous peoples\u2019 communities are expected since the housing \nloans will be provided to individuals who have purchased the property or are voluntarily making \nimprovements to their dwellings. Aavas\u2019 credit policy also excludes activities that impinge on lands \nowned or claimed under adjudication by indigenous peoples, or without the full consent of such \npeople. \n \n29.  Aavas has an established E&S policy. The chief risk officer is responsible for E&S matters, \nwhile the company secretary receives and responds to complaints from the public or civil society \norganizations.  Engineers  conduct  site  visits  and  prepare  valuation  reports  describing  the \nconditions in which the property is situated and the market value, based on prevailing market \nrates. Aavas has adopted the exclusion list of the International Finance Corporation. Internal \ntrainings on E&S are being provided by Aavas to all relevant staff, and compliance with E&S is \nalso reported in the annual monitoring report as part of its requirements to the CDC Group plc. \n \n29 ADB. 2017.

Aavas is an equal opportunity employer. Embedded in its \nrecruitment policy is the principle that Aavas does not discriminate based on gender, region, \nreligion, caste, or creed. To secure its employees\u2019 well-being, Aavas has adopted (i) a human \nresources policy outlining benefits, including maternity benefits and flexible work hours; (ii) a \nVishakha Policy (Policy Against Sexual Harassment) to prevent and deter sexual harassment at \nwork; (iii) an employee grievance redressal policy that ensures all communication channels are \nopen for employee grievances; and (iv) a whistleblower policy to encourage employees to report \nconcerns regarding unethical behavior or fraud. Aavas will (i) apply ADB\u2019s prohibited investment \nactivities list; (ii) exclude all projects that have adverse E&S social safeguard impacts (categories \nA and B); (iii) ensure that investments using ADB funds abide by applicable national laws and \nregulations; and (iv) comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (footnote 31). Aavas will \nconfirm these in its periodic reports to ADB. \n \n31.

Information disclosure will follow \nADB requirements.32 \n \n32.  Gender equity as a theme. Following ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development (1998), \nAavas has incorporated measures as part of a GAP.  \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n33.  Aavas was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \ncombating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that the \ninvestment  documentation  includes  appropriate  provisions  prohibiting  corruption,  money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.
