The sector is a large employer generating over 9100 jobs and annual consumption of \nfresh fish is estimated at over 44 kg per capita. With a GDP contribution of some F$92 \nmillion, the fisheries sector is the third largest natural resource sector (behind sugar and \n\u201cother crops\u201d) in the Fiji Islands. It is therefore of paramount importance that the Government \nestablishes management settings that are consistent with best practice to enable the Fiji \nIslands  to  maximize  the  economic  contribution  of  the  sector  whilst  ensuring  that  key \nconservation and environmental objectives are met. The purpose of this review is to assess \nexisting fisheries policies, programs and institutional settings with a view to identifying the \nreforms necessary in order to move the management of the Fiji Islands\u2019 fisheries strongly \ntowards best practice.  \n \nStarting  with  the  offshore  fishery,  the  Ministry  of  Fisheries  and  Forests  made  a \nfundamental  error  in  diverting  from  the  Tuna  Management  and  Development  Plan  by \nincreasing the cap on longline licenses to 110\u2014the Tuna Management and Development \nPlan had clearly set down a cap of 90 licenses for the 2002-2004 period (currently under \nreview). Increasing the cap had a severely detrimental effect on the economic performance \nof the offshore fishery over the 2003-2004 period. In future the license cap needs to be firmly \nestablished and the framework for establishing the cap clearly specified. This will provide for \ngreatly improved fishery performance, and, in addition, will provide an improved investment \nclimate for operators. Increasing license periods from one to five years is another necessary \nreform\u2014annual license renewal creates too much investment uncertainty making it difficult \nfor  operators  to  raise  capital.  There  should  be  no  further  deviations  from  the  Tuna \nManagement and Development Plan other than after formal review processes set down as a \nresult of the current review of the Tuna Management and Development Plan. Institutional \nreforms, including establishment of the proposed National Fisheries Authority (NFA) should \nhelp instill these processes.  \n \nManagement  of  inshore  fisheries  is  a  challenging  task\u2014this  is  recognized,  as  is  the \nprogress being made under the joint Department of Fisheries/FLMMA1 process of surveying \ninshore areas. However, the process needs to be accelerated, and surveying methods more \nfocused on the pressing issues for the inshore management area rather than on providing a \ncomprehensive species listing. The role of extension officers needs to be modernized and \nfocused more on resource conservation and development of management plans and less on \nfisheries  development\u2014fisheries  development  is  an  antiquated  concept  given  the \naccessibility to vessels and outboards, and the over-exploitation of stock in many areas \n(particularly areas close to villages and markets). Generally, areas that are not fully exploited \nare those where it is not economic to fish due to the distance from markets. High priority \nshould be placed on developing management plans and increasing the resources applied to \nthe fish warden system as illegal fishing practices are common in many parts of the Fiji \nIslands. \n \nThe structure for management of the marine aquarium fishery needs to be solidified. Key \nconcerns include the slow progress of many operators in introducing management plans and \nthe imminent departure of key officers from NGOs who have been driving the management \nprocess. Additional resources will need to be applied to the management of the sector to \nensure there are no repeats of the ban placed on exports of marine aquarium products from \nthe Fiji Islands in 2002 under the Convention on the International Trade of Endangered \nSpecies (CITES) (which caused considerable economic losses). \n \n                                                 \n1 Fiji Section of the Locally-Managed Marine Area Network. ", "Focus on management of aquaculture needs to shift towards the control of environmental \nimpacts.  Controls  over  the  location  of  farms  should  only  be  based  on  environmental \nconcerns as opposed to Fisheries influencing the size and location of farms on the basis of \nits assessment of an economically-efficient model. \n \nFishery  indigenous  participation  schemes\u2014such  as  the  1/3  \u2013  2/3  subsidy  scheme, \nSCARF finance scheme, and reservation of 50% of offshore tuna licenses for Indigenous \nFijans, goals for indigenous Fijians to operate 90% of pearl oyster farms\u2014are inefficient and \nneed to be reviewed. Some of these measures could deter much needed entrepreneurial \nskills  and  capital  from  flowing  into  the  sector,  and  some  measures  could  perpetuate \ninefficient  industry  structures.  Overall,  the  Government  needs  to  assess  the  costs  and \nbenefits of all policies designed to promote indigenous participation and major reform of \nindigenous participation schemes is needed. \n \nA number of fisheries taxation issues have been identified and need to be further reviewed \nsuch as the fuel duty, access fees and low levels of cost recovery. Valuation frameworks to \nempower  qoliqoli  owners  in  negotiations  with  entities  seeking  access  to  their  marine \nresource also need to be developed. \n \nFishery development programs\u2014such as aquaculture programs, deepwater snapper, and \nsmall-scale  tuna  programs\u2014are  currently  not  subject  to  rigorous  evaluation  processes. \nIneffective schemes, or schemes targeting uneconomic fisheries, are not being re-designed \nor, where necessary, discontinued. A more rigorous evaluation process for examining the \neconomics of fishery programs is needed and should become a very high priority for reform. \nImportantly, individuals not directly associated with the programs should be charged with the \nresponsibility  of  reviewing  programs.  Spurious  performance  indicators,  such  as  the \nkilograms  of  fish  caught,  are  being  forwarded  as  evidence  of  program  success.  More \nmeaningful indicators such as the economic profits for operators should be focused on. \n \nGenerally, research is poorly focused and needs to be better aligned to with management \nsystems. For example, the types of research undertaken at the Makogai Research Station \ndo not have a close enough linkage with management objectives and there is too much \nattention presently focused on biological and pure research. There is a need to more finely \nfocus the research needs of the  Department, and it is recommended that a Research \nAdvisory Committee be established, drawing on the available expertise from the University \nof  the  South  Pacific,  NGOs  and  Government  Agencies  including  the  Department  of \nEnvironment and the Department of Fisheries. \n \nIn  respect  of  institutional  reforms  establishing  a  NFA  to  replace  the  Department  of \nFisheries would represent a major move towards best practice. The NFA would better align \nfunctions and activity centers with the roles of a modern fisheries management agency. The \nNFA would increase accountability and facilitate a clear distinction between management \nroles. Given its board structure it would also provide a vehicle for drawing upon the skills and \nexpertise of eminent fisheries specialists working in Fiji for the University of the South Pacific \nand for various NGOs.  \n \nA renewed commitment to legislative reform is necessary. There are many pending Bills \nthat need to be enacted to support the development of a modern management regime, \nincluding: the reform of the Fisheries Act. This reform is needed if: (i) Fiji Fisheries legislation \nis to be consistent with key conventions to which it is a signatory including the Convention on \nthe Law of the Sea and the 2004 Convention on the Conservation and Management of \nHighly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean; (ii) the Customary \nFisheries Bill becomes law, as expected, by mid-2005; (iii) if the Department of Fisheries is \nto be able to support management of post-harvest activities; and (iv) to support management \nof aquaculture. Moreover, the Environment Management Bill was forwarded in 1997 but is ", " \nyet to be enacted.  The low budget that the Ministry has allocated for this purpose is an \nindicator of the low priority of legislative reform. This also needs to be addressed.  \n \nThe Department\u2019s in-house capability needs to be greatly strengthened and resources are \nrequired to retain expert advice on policy matters. The Department of Fisheries\u2019 capability to \ndevelop policy papers assessing the economic, social and environmental impacts of policies \nis  quite  low,  leading  to  policies  being  made  \u201con  the  run\u201d  and  over-reliance  on  blunt \ninstruments  such  as  subsidies  to  assist  under-performing  sectors.  Extensive  capacity \nbuilding is required to help address these problems and to facilitate the reform process. A \ntwo year technical assistance (TA) program is strongly recommended with input for the \nduration  of the  TA  required  from an  economist,  a  policy  specialist, and  a  specialist  in \nmanagement at the local community level. Commitment to an agreed reform program should \nbe a requirement under any donor supported TA program.  \n \nUnderpinning the current poor capacity to effectively drive the policy development process is \nthe  lack of capacity within the Department to evaluate the economic effects of \nfisheries policies.  This  shortcoming  is  considered  one  of  the  most  serious  problems \nencountered by the Department at this point in time. (This capacity is also required to \neffectively manage the process of contracting out of specific projects to external research \nagencies/consultants) \n \nDepartment morale is being adversely affected by the ongoing transparency problems and \nallegations of corruption. A zero tolerance approach is required. The proposed institutional \nreforms should provide structural support to improvements in the level of transparency. \n \nRealistically, sector growth will largely be dictated by tuna prices in the United States and \nJapan, as this will affect the value of the tuna catch. Locally important, but less critical at the \nnational scale, will be growth of pearl oyster farms and possibly shrimp farming. History has \nproven, however, that aquaculture growth is speculative at best and hence there is a low \nprobability of meeting the Department\u2019s ambitious growth expectations for the sector. The \noffshore fishery may also be able to extend into swordfish fishing but exploratory fishing is \nyet  to  confirm  whether  this  is  viable.  The  marine  aquarium  fishery  has  strong  growth \npotential\u2014possibly increasing by 3 times its current size to a total export value of F$42 \nmillion within a 10-year period.  \n \nWays to promote growth include overcoming the remaining infrastructure deficiencies (eg. \nOvercrowding at Walu Bay and Lami), and possibly meeting some regional infrastructure \nrequirements  (eg.  Port  in  Labasa).  Rigorous  cost  benefit  studies  and    a  whole-of-\nGovernment approach are required in respect of many of these infrastructure investments, \nincluding evaluation of future investment in Rural Fisheries Service Centers. \n \nThe most important step that Government can take to promote growth of the sector is to \nintroduce management plans that support healthy fish stocks, thus increasing catch rates \nand improving the efficiency of fisheries (i.e. lower cost of catching fish). The second most \nimportant step is to lower the cost of doing business in Fiji using non-sector specific reforms. \nThis will require vigorously pursuing reform to address the following structural problems: \npolitical  uncertainty,  weak  property  rights,  costly  telecommunications,  inefficient  taxes, \nburdensome regulation, an ineffective legal system for business, and poorly functioning \nfinance markets. The review team\u2019s survey of fisheries sector businesses in Fiji revealed that \nfrom the private sector\u2019s perspective, the primary impediment to growth is taxes on fuel and \nother inputs. The second and third most significant problems are finding productive/skilled \nstaff  and  \u201cunnecessary  red  tape  in  dealing  with  Fisheries  and  other  Government \nDepartments\u201d respectively. The Government should seek to resolve these problems. \n ", "Simply put, the MFF is way off track in even considering establishment of a NFC. It is \ninappropriate for Governments to operate fishing companies as they do not have adequate  \ncommercial incentives and a serious conflicts of interest  are created. The NFC would either \nend up being heavily subsidized or going out of business and would crowd out more efficient \nprivate sector operators. Therefore, developing a NFC would have the opposite effect of that \nintended by MFF as it would reduce the economic performance of the sector. \n \nThe importance of change management should not be lost on the Government, and the \nDepartment of Fisheries will need to increase its economic and policy evaluation capability to \nassist with critical emerging issues. Change management will be required to address the \nimpacts of new systems for allocating the regional tuna resource under the new Western and \nCentral Pacific Fisheries Commission. While the new Customary Fisheries Bill is expected to \nhave little impact on the management process, it will hand possession of qoliqoli back to the \ncustomary owners and hence create an entirely new regime for commercial dealings with \ncustomary owners - a regime that will need to be managed and carefully monitored.  \n ", " \nI.  INTRODUCTION \n1.  The fisheries sector in the Fiji Islands makes an extremely important contribution to \nthe lives of many Fijians. The sector is a large employer generating over 9100 jobs2 and \nannual consumption of fish estimated at over 44 kg per capita.3 In addition, the fisheries \nsector is the third largest natural resource sector (behind sugar and \u201cother crops\u201d) in the Fiji \nIslands.  \n \n2.  It  is  therefore  of  paramount  importance  that  the  Government  establishes \nmanagement settings that are consistent with best practice to enable the Fiji Islands to \nmaximize the economic contribution of the sector whilst ensuring key conservation and \nenvironmental objectives are met. The purpose of this review is to assess existing fisheries \npolicies, programs and institutional settings with a view to identifying the reforms required if \nmanagement of the Fiji Islands\u2019 fisheries is to move strongly in the direction of best practice.  \n \n3.  This review also focuses on growth potential for fisheries. The Ministry of Fisheries \nand Forests (MFF) has set a target for the sector to grow to F$1 billion (gross receipts) \nwithin 10 years. To support this \u201cbullish\u201d target MFF has set out to review its direction \nincluding its future investment program. We assess the veracity of the Government\u2019s growth \ntargets and conduct a high-level evaluation of its investment program for the sector. Other \naspects  of  the  Government\u2019s  approach  to  promoting  sector  growth  are  also  reviewed. \nAppropriate  investments  and  interventions  to  improve  the  performance  of  fisheries  and \nstimulate sustainable sector growth, are identified. \n \n \nII.  FIJI ISLANDS\u2019 FISHERIES SECTOR \n4.  The Fiji Islands fish harvesting sector\u2014incorporating offshore, inshore (artisanal and \nsubsistence), aquaculture and collection fisheries (coral and live rock collection, beche-de-\nmer and trochus)\u2014contributes an estimated F$78.4 million to the Fiji Islands\u2019 economy.   An \nestimated 6847 Fijians are engaged in either commercial or subsistence fishing. The annual \nfish harvest, particularly from the Fiji Island\u2019s inshore waters, represents an important source \nof  nutrition,  with  over  28,000  mt  of  locally-caught  fish  consumed  by  the  Fiji  Island\u2019s \npopulation. \n \n5.  Suppliers of inputs to the fishing industry (eg., fishing gear, slipway services, docking \nfacilities, etc) and processors also generate substantial economic benefits with processors \ncontributing a further F$9.3 million to GDP and input suppliers contributing F$4.2 million.  \n \n6.  Including  fish  harvesting,  input  supplies,  and  processing  the  total  economic \ncontribution of the sector is F$91.9 million or 2.5% of total GDP. \n \n7.  Budgetary impacts of the sector are significant. Total outlays by the Fiji Islands \nGovernment, in terms of management, research and enforcement costs, amount to F$7.3 \nmillion per annum. However, total access-fee, management/license-fee and other revenues \namount to some F$3.8 million, giving a net outlay of F$3.5 million. Donor agencies and non-\ngovernment organizations (NGOs) also contribute considerable funds to the sector. Donor \nagencies such as the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Japanese International Cooperation \nAgency (JICA), and the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID) have \nfocused on infrastructure requirements, boat subsidies and research into, and support of, \n                                                 \n2 Includes employment in harvesting, processing and input supplying sectors but not employment resulting from \nbroader economic flow-on effects. \n3 Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2002. The Contribution of Fisheries to the Economies of Pacific Island \nCountries, Pacific Studies Series, Manila. ", "2 \naquaculture. Naturally, NGOs such as TRAFFIC4 the Marine Aquarium Council and World \nWorldwide  Fund  for  Nature  (WWF)  focus  predominantly  on  conservation  of  marine \nresources, but, in doing so, they make an important contribution to the long-term economic \nvalue of those resources. \n \nA.  Capture Fisheries \n8.  Fish  harvesting  sectors  can  be  divided  into  offshore,  artisanal  (small-scale \ncommercial), and subsistence fisheries. The distinction between subsistence and artisanal \nfisheries is often blurred with a significant proportion of the subsistence catch being supplied \nto municipal and non-municipal markets (ie., hotels and resorts, road-side outlets, butchers, \nfish shops, and supermarkets).  \n \n9.  Total catch from Fiji Islands\u2019 waters currently stands at just under 50,000 mt  (Table \n2.1), representing a 60% increase from the estimated catch in 1990. This increase is a direct \nresult of the development of the offshore longline fishery\u2014it comprised just six vessels in \n1990 compared to its peak of over 100 vessels in 2002. More recently, in response to a \nreduction in catch rates, vessel numbers have moderated in the offshore fishery with some \n85 vessels active in the fishery in 2004. An even lower number applied for licenses in 2005, \nwith a number of charter vessels electing to fish elsewhere in the region. Offshore longliners \nemploy a total of 510 domestic crew in addition to a large number of international crew \n(Chinese, Korean, Japanese) employed on locally owned, joint venture and charter vessels.  \n \n10.  There is currently an estimated 895 boats operating in the country\u2019s small-scale \nfisheries, most of which are small 15 foot skiffs, although there are also a small number of \nsmall-scale tuna boats and deepwater snapper boats in operation (around 6-10). The total \nnumber of crew in the artisanal fleet is currently 2137, although many of the artisanal fishers \nhave additional sources of income. \n \nTable 2.1: Total Capture Fishery Catch, 1997-2003 \n(metric tons) \n \nCategory  1997  1998  1999  2000  2001  2002  2003 \nOffshore  4256  4801 5025 11,441 12,219  16,472  12,205\nArtisanal-Finfish  3494  4183 4711 4047 4329  4040  4439\nArtisanal Non-finfish  2326  2630 2679 2634 2757  2832  2232\nSubsistencea 17,400  17,600 21,600 21,600 21,600  21,600  21,600\nTotal Catch  33,296  36,028 41,405 46,403 47,991  51,814  47,146\n   Source: Department of Fisheries, ADB 2002 (revised subsistence catch data for 1999-2003). \n \n11.  Focusing on the catch taken by the offshore longline fleet it is estimated that 42% of \ncatch is sold to canneries (avg. ex-vessel price5 of F$3547), 37% is fresh exports (avg. price \nof F$6207), and 21% is domestic sales (average price of F$2200 for tuna and F$2000 for \nby-catch). This gives a total value of catch of F$49.5 million for 2003 for the offshore fleet. \nThe Department of Fisheries (DOF) estimates the total value of artisanal catch at F$27.6 \nmillion and the ADB6 estimates the total value of subsistence catch to be equivalent to \n                                                 \n4 TRAFFIC Oceania South Pacific Programme is hosted by the World Wide Fund for Nature in Suva, Fiji and is \nfunded by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office of the UK Government.

The marine aquarium fishery consists of just five operators. Due to the importance of \nbeing situated close to major airports all of these operators are based on the Fiji Islands\u2019 \nmain island of Viti Levu with collection activities taking place on the coral coast (southern \ncoast of Viti Levu) and in islands groups south east of Lautoka (near Nadi). The largest \noperator, Walt Smith International, exports more than 50% of the industry total and employs \n70 on-shore staff and around 300 collectors and divers. Total employment of Fijians in \ncollection/diving is estimated to be close to 650 with about 150 persons employed by marine \naquarium companies in on-shore roles. \n \n13.  The fishery overcame a temporary ban on exports imposed under the Convention on \nthe International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES) in 2002, and now boasts exports of \nF$14 million (DOF)\u2014second only to tuna exports. Live rock exports represent F$8 million, \nlive coral exports are worth F$4.5 million and aquarium fish exports are valued at F$1.5 \nmillion. The Fiji Islands exports approximately 95% of the world supply of live rock but most \nof the live rock exports are taken from the wild\u2014some industry stakeholders are pushing to \nboost exports of cultured live rock to 80% of the total to ensure the ongoing sustainability of \nthe sector. Lovell7 estimated that some F$2 million in wages and royalties is paid to villages \neach year. It is also relevant to note that there are significant benefits to local villages from \nlease payments. Marine aquarium operators make annual access payments of between \nF$3000 to F$28,000 to local villages and collectors/divers can earn in the range of F$90 to \nF$228 per week.8\n \n14.  The upward trend in exports has been quite marked,9 however, the industry needs to \nconsolidate its management regime if it is continue to grow as the export markets in the \nUnited States (US) and Europe will only accept product that has been collected in a fashion \nthat is \u201cnon-detrimental\u201d to the environment. Hence management must be sufficiently robust \nto ensure there are no further CITES bans. \n \nC.  Aquaculture \n15.  The  principal  types  of  aquaculture  in  the  Fiji  Islands  include  pearl  oyster  and \nseaweed (mariculture), shrimps (brackish water), and tilapia and prawns (freshwater). Clams \ntrochus and turtles are grown at the Makogai Research Station by Fisheries for seeding in \nareas  near  villages.  Small  quantities  of  carp  and  ornamental  fish  are  also  farmed  in \nfreshwater  ponds,  and  there  is  periodic  experimentation  with  various  other  forms  of \naquaculture\u2014currently there is some experimentation with farming of reef fish for the live \nreef food fish (LRFF) trade.  \n \n16.  The aquaculture sector has not progressed as rapidly as might have been expected \ngiven  the  large  amount  of  resources  that  have  been  invested  by  donor  agencies  and \nFisheries in undertaking research, subsidizing ponds and other infrastructure, establishing \nhatcheries and in developing pilot farms. Total aquaculture production for 2003 was 400 mt \n(mostly tilapia) valued at some F$1.9 million (Table 2.2). However, the value of production \n                                                 \n7 Lovell, E. 2004.

In terms of employment, over 400 individuals are directly involved in Tilapia farming, \nand  an  estimated  150  Fijians  are  employed  in  all  other  forms  of  aquaculture.    Total \nemployment in the sector is therefore estimated at 550 with high levels of participation by \nvillagers in many aspects of aquaculture (operation of tilapia farms, spat collection and \noyster cleaning and line repairs for pearl oyster farming, seaweed farming in the Southern \nLau Group, etc). The Department is optimistic about the potential for growth in shrimp, \nseaweed and tilapia farming, although there remains considerable uncertainty over potential \nexpansion of these sectors (Section VII). If there is growth in aquaculture this could result in \nsignificant benefits for local villages through both employment opportunities and access \npayments. For example, Taylor Shellfish has entered into a commercial agreement with the \nlocal village in Savusavu whereby the village receives 5% equity plus an annual lease \npayment of F$30,000. \n \nD.  Charter Fishing/Sport Fishing \n18.  There is an estimated 20-30 commercial charter and sportfishing boats currently \noperating in the Fiji Islands, and with rapid recent growth in tourism the sector is enjoying an \nexpansion phase. Billfish are the main species targeted, although mahi mahi and wahoo are \nmore common in the catch. Total receipts for the sector are estimated at approximately \nF$1.2 million per annum, and employment is about 60 full-time equivalents. \n \nE.  Processing \n19.  Processing of finfish takes four forms: (a) large-scale processing undertaken by the \nPacific Fishing Company (PAFCO); (b) smaller-scale canning of predominantly imported \nmackerel (c) marketing, packaging transport and export of tuna and tuna by-catch by large \nfishing  companies  such  as  Fiji  Fish,  which  operates  between  14  and  23  longliners \n(depending on the size of its charter fleet), and around 6-7 other dedicated processors; and \n(d)  some  small-scale  fish  smoking  and  fish  filleting  operations.  (We  exclude  further \nconsideration of output for category (b) because it is essentially a re-export activity with no \nmeaningful linkage with the country\u2019s fisheries.)  \n \n20.  Other forms of processing activity include beche-de-mer processing and button blank \nmanufacturing using trochus shells, and there is also a small amount of value-added of black \npearls using village-based labor.  ", "5 \n \n21.  Just under 60% of PAFCO\u2019s F$22million revenue in FY 2004 was from loining, 38% \nfrom canning and a small amount of revenue from the sale of low grade fish to the domestic \nmarket. According to the FFA/SPC10, in recent times around 17% of sashimi grade tuna has \nbeen exported to Japan (grade 1 bigeye and yellowfin) and 58% to America (grade 2), while \nmost of the remaining 35% is exported to China, Australia and Canada. Apart from PAFCO \nthere is relatively little value-adding of fish landed in the Fiji Islands (apart from re-exporting \nof mackerel etc.). Opportunities exist for developing loining and smoking activities but this is \ndependent on progress being made in applying Hazard Analysis at Critical Control Points \n(HACCP)  standards  for  fish  handling  and  in  overcoming  other  regulatory  impediments \n(Section  VII).  There  is  also  some  interest  in  developing  smaller-scale  value-added \noperations. \n \n22.  Total  employment  by  fish  processors  is  estimated  at  1,39411  including  the  800 \npermanent PAFCO employees. Based on a survey of operators conducted for this review, \nwages and salaries total an estimated F$8.9 million (includes F$5.4 million in wages and \nsalaries paid by PAFCO).  \n \nF.  Air Freight \n23.  Air freight costs are highly significant and represent approximately 30% of the total \ncost of supplying fresh fish to Japanese and US markets (Pers. Comm. Russell Durham, \nBusiness Manager, Fiji Fish). Air Pacific, QANTAS, and Air New Zealand air freight an \nestimated 5,000 mt of fish each year providing revenue of approximately F$20 million. \nIndustry analysts estimate the Air Pacific component of this revenue to be in the order of \n80%, representing an additional flow-on benefit of F$16 million to the Fijian economy from \nthe fishing industry. Air cargo capacity constraints are often cited as a limiting factor in \ngrowth of the country\u2019s fisheries\u2014this issue is further evaluated in Section VII, but generally \noperators are able to send fish through Auckland or Sydney if there is no available air-freight \nspace on direct flights to Japan and the US. \n \nG.  Fish Markets \n24.  Most of the artisanal catch, apart from the exported reef fish and LRFF, is supplied to \nthe  domestic  markets,  and,  as  mentioned,  around  21%  of  the  offshore  catch  is  sold \ndomestically. Domestic sales are either through municipal markets or non-municipal markets \n(fish shops, butchers and supermarkets and hotels). There are 16 municipal markets in the \nFiji Islands, seven in the central division, four in the western division, and five in the northern \ndivision. It is estimated that around 480 people (Pers. Comm. Warsha Singh, DOF) are \nemployed at the municipal markets, and, given markets operate for about half the week, this \nequates to 240 full-time equivalent jobs. There are an additional 36 dedicated fish retail \noutlets, employing some 100 Fijians. \n \nH.  Input Suppliers \n25.  Suppliers to the fishing industry include gear and equipment suppliers, boat builders \nand vessel maintenance, ice suppliers, slipway service providers, shipping agent services \n(including  transshipment,  provision  of  rations  etc),  port/jetty  services  (ie.,  provision  of \ndocking  space,  fuel,  and  water)  and  provisioning.  For  this  review  the  12  largest  input \nsuppliers were surveyed and they reported aggregate revenue of just under F$30 million, \nhowever it is likely that only about 70% of this amount, F$21 million, is revenue from sales to \n                                                 \n10 FFA/SPC FFA/SPC. 2004.

In addition, \nsome 47 people are employed at fishing jetties, ports and slipways throughout the Fiji \nIslands, and a further 53 people are employed by the Maritime Ports Authority in Suva. (It is \nconsidered reasonable to attribute around 30% of port and slipway related jobs to the fishing \nsector.) \n \nI.  Overall Economic Contribution of the Fisheries Sector \n26.  The overall economic contribution of the sector to GDP is shown Table 2.3. Table 2.3 \nshows the value of production, value-added estimates (value-added12 is the returns to capital \nand labor and represents the contribution to GDP of a sector) and employment estimates for \nall of the components of the fisheries sector described above. The aggregate revenue is just \nunder F$200 million, and the aggregate value-added is some F$91.9 million.  \n \nTable 2.3: Fisheries Sector Contribution to GDP, 2003 \n(F$\u2019000) \n \nCategory  Revenue  Value-addeda Employment \n(full time \n  (F$\u2019000)  (F$\u2019000) \nequivalents) \nOffshore Fishery  49,460  16,322  510 \nInshore Artisanal  27,630  16,578  2137 \nSubsistence  48,600  41,310  3000 \nMarine Aquarium  14,000  2,800  650 \nAquaculture  1,890  810  550 \nGame & Charter Fishing  1,180  590  60 \nPAFCO  21,733  6,153  800 \nOther fish processorsa 5,254  3,152  639 \nInput Suppliers  21,000  4,200  185 \nFish markets  na  na  340 \nDepartment of Fisheries  na  na  243 \nSlipways/ports  na  na  30 \nTotal  190,747  91,915  9144 \na)  Value-added is estimated by taking a percentage of revenue considered to represent the \nreturns to capital and labor. The relevant percentages are sourced in the following way: inshore \nfishery  and  subsistence  (ADB  2002);  PAFCO  (PAFCO  Annual  Report  2003,  \u201cOther  fish \nprocessors\u201d ((FFA/SPC 2004), see footnote (b)); and value-added percentages for aquaculture, \ngame and charter fishing, and marine aquarium fisheries were derived from confidential data \nprovided by industry participants.  \nb)  Represents revenue less ex-vessel payments for fish as these payments are reflected in \nrevenue for vessels. Estimate is based on on-shore processing, handling and freight costs of \nF$850/mt for fresh fish, and F$/185mt for domestic sales and sales to canneries.13( \nSource: Department of Fisheries, Consultant\u2019s estimates (based on discussions with fishing \nindustry operators, and a survey of operators). \n \n27.  Total sector exports are F$79 million consisting predominantly of tuna exports (F$49 \nmillion).  The  other  principal  exports  are  marine  aquarium  (F$14  million),  beche-de-mer \n(F$8.6 million), trochus (F$1.7 million), deepwater snapper (approx. F$250,000 p.a.) and \nLRFF (F$450,000 p.a.).  \n                                                 \n12 Put differently, value-added is an economic term to express the difference between the value of goods and the \ncost of materials or supplies that are used in producing them. \n \n13 FFA/SPC. 2004. An Economic Analysis of the Fiji Longline Fishery, Report to the Fiji Islands Government, \nNovember, Honiara. ", "7 \n \nJ.  GDP Contribution Comparison \n28.  From the viewpoint of establishing the appropriate effort that should be applied to the \ntask of improving the efficiency of fisheries management, it is instructive to compare the \ncontribution to GDP of fisheries with other key sectors. Figure 1 shows trends in GDP \ncontribution for the clothing & footwear, tourism (represented by hotels & restaurants), sugar \ncane, fishing and forestry sectors. For the purpose of this comparison we focus on all of the \nelements of the fisheries sector represented in the above discussion (ie., fish harvesting, \nprocessing, and input supply). \n \nFigure 1: Fisheries Sector GDP Compared with Other Key Sectors, 1990-2003 \n(F$\u2019000) \n \n250\nClothing & \n200\nfootwear\nHotels & \nrestuarants\n150 Sugar cane\ns\nn\no\nilli\nm\nF$  100 Fishing\n50\nForestry\n0\n1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002\n \nSource: Fiji Islands Bureau of Statistics, Consultant\u2019s estimates (fishing) \n \n29.  From the above figure it can be seen that the fisheries is highly significant, although \nsomewhat lower than other key sectors. In total fisheries contribute around 2.7% of GDP, \nwhile employment in the formal sector of 6144 represents around 5.4% of total employment \nin the Fiji Islands. Recent trends in the fishing sector have predominantly been driven by \nchanges in the offshore fishery catch with the inshore catch relatively stable. There is clearly \nan upward trend in tourism which is now a key driver of economic activity in the Fiji Islands \nbut both the sugar and clothing and footwear sectors have been in decline. \n \nK.  Government Budgetary Impacts \n30.  The Government receives revenue from the fisheries sector through payment of \ndirect  and  indirect  taxes,  access  fees,  management  fees,  license  fees  and  fines.  Not \nsurprisingly, most revenue is received from the offshore fishery (over F$1.3 million). Access \nfees are applied at the rate of F$15,000 for vessels less than 20 meters in length and ", "8 \nF$20,000 for vessels greater than 20 meters. These fees apply to charter, joint venture and \ndomestic vessels, but Indigenous license holders are not required to pay an access fee. \nManagement fees are fixed at F$6000 per vessel. (License fees for the domestic fleet only \ncame  into  effect  in  2002  when  the  Tuna  Development  and  Management  Plan  was \nimplemented.) \n \nTable 2.4: Government Budgetary Impacts \n(F$\u2019000) \n \nCategory  2002  2003  2004 \nFisheries Department Revenue       \nManagement fees (offshore fleet)  716.7  626.0  749.4 \nAccess & license fees  843.8  1,100.0  603.9 \nBerthing fees  46.1  12.5  11.1 \nSale of fish & ice  177.6  207.7  227.0 \nRegistration of fishing vessels  3.7  15.0  10.0 \n1/3 Small scale tuna assistance  174.6  92.8  24.2 \nTilapia project freight charge  6.8  28.6  23.4 \nCITES permits (marine aquarium fishery)  n/a  n/a  26.2 \nJapanese bilateral, access fees   n/a  n/a  57.3 \nUS multilateral treaty  n/a  n/a  464.6 \nTotal Revenue  1969.2  2082.6  3846.0 \n(less) Management Costs  n/a  5911.6  7305.7 \nNet Budgetary Positiona   Minus 3,829.0  Minus 3,459.7 \na)  Tax contributions from the fishing sector are likely to result in an overall positive budgetary impact. \nFiji Islands Customs and Inland Revenue declined our request for tax revenue information. \nSource: Department of Fisheries. \n \n31.  Overall, net budgetary outlays of F$3.5 million are required to support the operations \nof the DOF. Apart from the offshore fishery, the only other fishery to contribute significantly \nto management costs is the marine aquarium fishery which contributes annual levies of just \nunder F$30,000. Given the heavy reliance on subsidies it is difficult to envisage increases in \nthe level of cost recovery from other fisheries in the short- to medium-term. \n \n \nIII.  EVALUATION OF FISHERY POLICIES \n32.  The review team assessed all relevant policy documents (although the DOF does not \nprepare many policy papers per se, or, if it does, it did not furnish the review team with many \npolicy papers), conducted a number of workshops and held a series of meetings with a \nbroad  spectrum  of  stakeholders  to  facilitate  the  assessment  of  fisheries  policies.  Our \ngreatest  concerns  relate  to  the  lack  of  adherence  to  the  Tuna  Management  and \nDevelopment  Plan  in  the  offshore  fishery,  the  absence  of  effective/responsive  inshore \nfisheries  management  initiatives  and  the  incorrect  focus  on  product  development  as \nopposed to resource management in the inshore fisheries. Also of concern is the slow rate of \nprogress  in  developing  and  implementing  management  plans  and  in  introducing  key \nlegislation to support the management process. As can be gleaned from the discussion \nbelow, the DOF needs to establish clearer objectives for fisheries management and re-align \nthe processes it uses to assess management performance accordingly.  \n ", "9 \nA.  The Offshore Longline Fishery \n33.  The Offshore Longline Fishery had the benefit of considerable resources for the \npurpose of developing the 2002 Tuna Management and Development Plan. As a result, the \nfishery should have been at the forefront amongst the Fiji Islands\u2019 fisheries in terms of \nmanagement outcomes. Instead, the fishery encountered extreme economic difficulties in \n2003-2004 due to excessive vessel numbers as well as adverse swings in environmental \nconditions and declining prices.14\n \n34.  The  rapid  increase  in  vessel  numbers  through  the  late  1990s  and  early  2000s \n(Appendix 2) was poorly managed. Vessel numbers jumped from 43 in 1999 to 103 in 2002. \nDomestic operators report large financial losses as a direct result of this rapid influx of \nvessels.15\n \n35.  MFF should have adopted a precautionary approach and avoided the rapid increase \nin fishing effort, given the extensive knowledge we have about the tendency worldwide for \ntoo many vessels to enter fisheries. Moreover, in the Tuna Management and Development \nPlan, fisheries had both the advice and the mechanism to adopt a sound management \napproach.  \n \n36.  Documents in the plan state that in January 2002, the Cabinet of the Government of \nthe Fiji Islands considered the Plan and decided:  \n \n(i)  Catch Limits: 15,000t for bigeye,  albacore and yellowfin  taken in the Fiji \nIslands\u2019  exclusive  economic  zone  (EEZ)  in  each  of  2002  and  2003 \n(subsequent to release of the plan, the Secretariat of the Pacific Community \n(SPC) has indicated that the appropriate catch limit should be 10,000 mt);  \n \n(ii)  License Limits: 90 longliners, including 20 for Indigenous Fijians.16 \n \n(iii)  License Criteria: a set of new criteria to screen license applications, which will \nfavor Indigenous Fijians.17 \n \n37.  According to officials of the Fisheries Department, a Cabinet decision in December \n2003 increased the number of licenses to 110, comprising 60 open licenses, 25 reserved for \nindigenous Fijians and 25 for vessels associated with processors.  Other proposals for \nchanges made since the January 2002 Cabinet decision include: \n \n(i)  Licensed holders are able to pay access fees on a pro-rata basis, rather than \nfor an entire calendar year (adopted).  \n \n(ii)  A proposal that the archipelagic zone be reserved for indigenous operators (in \nJanuary 2005 the decision was made to reserve the archipelagic zone for \n                                                 \n14 Note: in assessing the performance of the tuna fishery it is necessary to take account of trends in the region \nduring the period being examined especially given the migratory nature of the tuna species. \n15 Langley (2003) also reports that negative environmental influences on catch rates could have contributed to \npoor fishery performance over the 2002-2004 period. In addition, declining prices and rising fuel prices \ncontributed to the downturn in financial performance of the longline fleet. \n16 MFF advised (pers. comm. Miit Baleivanualala CEO MFF) that the number increased to 110 on the request of \nprocessors to have dedicated license for supply purpose. However, this does not represent a logical basis for \ndeviating from the TMDP because processors\u2019 incentives do not align with incentives for sound fishery \nmanagement. \n17 According to MFF licenses (pers. Comm. Miit Baleivanualala CEO MFF) will only be issued to indigenous \noperators if capacity becomes available. ", "10 \nlocal  operators  but,  surprisingly,  there  was  no  evidence  of  any  thorough \nassessment of the costs and benefits of this policy).18 \n \n(iii)  At a plan review meeting held in November 2003 the idea of an economic \nreview of the longline industry was proposed and supported (undertaken by \nSPC/Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA) in late 2004).  \n \n38.  It is important to note that the plan (adopted in 2002) was primarily intended to limit \nfishing effort during a two-year period of improving the catch and effort database so that \nresource managers would have better information for management.  After a two-year period, \nthe plan anticipates that a \u201clonger term and more complex approach to management of the \ntuna fishery\u201d will be developed.  The plan is currently being reviewed. \n \n39.  Since the plan was adopted, longline tuna fishing has been relatively poor, especially \nin 2003. As mentioned, this caused financial difficulties for the fishing companies and, to \nsome extent, greater friction both within the industry and between the industry and the \nFisheries Department as companies struggled to survive. Another result of the poor fishing \nwas that both the industry and the Fisheries Department began paying more attention to \neconomic factors in setting a total allowable catch (TAC) and license numbers\u2014clearly a \nstep  in  the  right  direction\u2014rather  than  the  previous  focus  on  biological  sustainability. \nSPC/FFA  conducted  economic  modeling  of  the  fishery  but  this  is  not  sufficiently  well \ndeveloped to be used for policy purposes (Pers. Comm. Adam Langley, Oceanic Fisheries \nProgramme, SPC). The principal shortfall with the existing version of the model is that it \ndoes not account for fishing by domestic longliners outside the zone\u2014this is a significant \nanomaly given catch from outside the zone comprises up to 40% of the total catch.19\n \n40.  Apart from the influx of too many vessels, the fishery is confronted by a number of \nother issues including: \n \n(i)  Fragmentation  of  the  industry\u2014there  is  one  powerful  fishing  company, \nseveral intermediate-size fishing businesses, single-vessel operations, and \nthe processors (both for fresh and canning markets). Participants include \nlocal non-indigenous Fiji Islands citizens, indigenous Fijians, and expatriates.  \nThere  is  no  inclusive  association  and  a  fully  encompassing  government-\nindustry dialogue is difficult. \n \n(ii)  Allegations  of  corrupt  practices\u2014these  allegations  have  been  leveled  at \nFisheries Department officials with licensing responsibilities and associated \nsuspensions occurring.  These have challenged the credibility of the DOF but \nmoves initiated by senior Ministry officials are attempting to investigate the \nallegations and prosecute offenders.20 \n \n(iii)  Competition for access to infrastructure and services\u2014many longline vessels \nthat are not licensed to fish in Fiji Islands waters offload their catch at Suva. \nSome individuals feel that this is beneficial to the Fiji Islands as it generates \neconomic  activity,  makes  additional  by-catch  available,  and  assists  the \nprocess of making Suva a hub for tuna fishing in the Western Pacific. Some \n                                                 \n18 MFF advised (pers. comm. Miit Baleivanualala, CEO MFF) that this was a precautionary approach based on \nthe observation of the plan and to protect locally owned vessels under localization of industry.  \n19 In addition, the costs modeling had used average rather than fleet types and sizes, and without sensitivity \nanalyses to help the understanding of the issues. The other issue to be addressed is the tax benefits enjoyed \nby the different fleet categories and how this affects the evaluation of costs and benefits of alternate fleet sizes \nand configurations. \n20 MFF (pers. comm. Miit Baleivanualala, CEO MFF) advised that the industry has not filed evidences with Police \nto progress police investigations. ", "11 \nof the major participants in the tuna industry, however, feel that such vessels \nare detrimental as they take up limited dock space, utilize much of the scarce \nair cargo capacity, employ few Fijians, and may be fishing illegally in Fiji \nIslands waters. \n \n1.  Assessment of the Management Effort \n41.  Significant progress has been made in offshore fisheries management in the Fiji \nIslands  during  the  last  five  years.  Using  the  framework  of  the  Tuna  Management  and \nDevelopment Plan, there are now sound management systems in place, although there \nremain numerous difficulties in offshore fisheries management.   \n \n42.  Key staff with responsibilities in tuna fishery management indicated that the major \ninstitutional  weaknesses  of  the  DOF  are  lack  of  economic  expertise  and  trained  staff.  \nAccording to several tuna industry participants, the main institutional weaknesses of the \nFisheries Department are low efficiency, accountability and transparency. As an example of \nthe latter item, fishing companies cite the refusal of the Fisheries Department in late 2004 to \nmake public the list of licensed vessels. To some extent, the views of both groups seem \nvalid: \n \n(i)  The tuna industry is now fully-, if not over-developed, and hence the DOF will \nneed  to  make  an  increasing  number  of  crucial  decisions  in  fisheries \nmanagement, many of which require the consideration of economic tradeoffs. \nThe Department presently does not have the economic expertise to make \nthese evaluations.21 \n \n(ii)  Although  progress  has  been  made  in  promoting  transparency  in  the \nDepartment, much remains to be done in terms of both process (for example, \nthe evaluating of applications for licenses) and outcomes (for example, the list \nof licensed vessels).22 With this in mind, and considering the past problems of \nthe Department associated with corruption,23 there seems to be a strong case \nfor tuna management to be considerably more transparent than at present. \n \n(iii)  One difficulty that needs to be addressed is the issue of departures from the \nTuna Management and Development Plan by the DOF.  This is of major \nconcern to the industry and is exemplified by the statement of a key longline \noperator: \u201c80% of our problems with the Department are about them violating \ntheir  own  plan\u201d.    There  should  be  mechanisms  developed  to  ensure \nadherence to the plan. Conversely, it is also important to have a system that \nis both formal and transparent for modifying the plan when circumstances \nrequire this be done. \n \n43.  The  present  Tuna  Management  and  Development  Plan  contains  provisions  for \nperiodic review and it is intended that the steering committee established in the formation of \nthe plan will meet regularly to assess progress. What appears to be lacking is a mechanism \nwhereby grievances related to tuna management can be resolved, or at least addressed.  \nThis  contributes  to  an  unhealthy  business  atmosphere,  continuance  of  some  unfair \n                                                 \n21 This impacts not only tuna management, but also the development and management of other fisheries as well. \n22 The term \u201ctransparency\u201d appears several times in the Tuna Management and Development Plan and, indeed, \none of the objectives of the plan is to \u201censure transparency, accountability and efficiency within the Fisheries \nDepartment\u201d.   \n23 It would be difficult to argue that the allegations of corruption and conflict of interest in the Fisheries \nDepartment grew out of too much transparency. ", "12 \npractices,  and  promotes  an  environment  whereby  non-productive  means  to  address \ngrievances is encouraged.24  \n \n44.  On  the  basis  of  the  above  observations  and  assessments  we  make  two  key \nrecommendations in respect of the offshore fishery. \n \nRecommendation 1. It is recommended that the following be incorporated in the 2005 review of \nthe Tuna Management and Development Plan: \n \n(i)  the revised plan should address chartering and joint ventures, as well as the associated \nissues  of  re-flagging  and  accumulating  catch  history.  Prior  to  doing  so,  a  critical \nexamination should be made of the objectives of chartering, the costs of doing so, \nimpacts on other segments of the tuna industry, and other options available for achieving \nthe same objectives; \n \n(ii)  the revised plan should contain mechanisms to encourage adherence by the DOF, and a \nformal/transparent system for amending the plan when it is required; and \n \n(iii)  the revised plan should contain increased provisions for other types of offshore longlining \nthat could become more prevalent in the Fiji Islands in the coming years, such as fishing \nfor swordfish and other species. \n \n \nRecommendation 2. To improve the management of offshore fisheries at a higher level than the \nTuna Management and Development Plan, it is recommended that: \n \n(i)  Overall, the Department and Ministry need a change of corporate culture with respect to \ntransparency. This will require a change in attitude from releasing the bare minimum of \ninformation to the public, to one of withholding the bare minimum. \n \n(ii)  Under the Fisheries Act, all fishing licenses expire on December 31 of each year which \nmeans that the maximum period for a license is one year. For the tuna industry, this \nperiod is too short, increasing investment uncertainty and thus damaging the capacity of \nvessel operators to obtain debt and equity finance.  Hence, revision of the Fisheries Act \nshould include provision for a much longer license period, say 5-7 years, for offshore \nfishing. \n \n(iii)  Adopting a National Fisheries Authority approach (covering all fishery sub-sectors) would \nimprove the accountability, stakeholder input, transparency, and relevancy that is so \ndesperately needed in the government\u2019s interventions in the fisheries sector. \n \n45.  Moreover,  the  DOF  will  need  to  closely  monitor  developments  flowing  from \ncommencement  of  new  regional  management  regimes  under  the  recently  established \nWestern and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission, implications this has for the TAC and \nmanagement  of  the  Fiji  Islands\u2019  offshore  fishery.  This  is  a  critical  element  of  change \nmanagement that must be attended to with diligence. Advice from external specialists should \nbe sought in respect of key developments and in evaluating options for country\u2019s response to \nsuch developments. \n \n                                                 \n24 The Fisheries Specialist for the Fiji Fisheries Sector Review (Gillett 2005) noted that: \u201cat present, the owner of \nFiji Fish has access to the Prime Minister which he uses along with articles in the media when he feels that \nFisheries Department activities/policies are unreasonable. Other industry participants do not enjoy such access \nand are often frustrated in attempting to settle grievances by discussions with senior Ministry officials.\u201d  ", "13 \n46.  Once  the  fishery  has  stabilized  other  issues  that  should  be  examined  include \nfisheries taxation. Depending on developments with the recently established Western and \nCentral Pacific Fisheries Commission, it may also be appropriate to examine the option of a \ntransferable quota system (built into this system could be some scope for the TAC to be \nadjusted (but only following a formal evaluation process), in which case quota would be \nrepresented by a proportion of TAC, as opposed to a fixed mt allocation). Davis25 also \nidentifies considerable potential in respect of a share management system for the offshore \nfishery which may have merit as the fishery stabilizes. Further review of the experience in \nother countries with share management is required to identify the common characteristics of \nfisheries  which  are  considered  well  suited  to  share  management  before  this  option  is \ndeveloped further26. The Department should monitor developments in respect of use of \ntransferable quota for management of tuna and should openly liaise with industry on this \nissue.  However,  industry  should  only  be  consulted  after  robust  policy  and  discussion \npapers/working papers on the issue have been prepared. \n \nB.  Inshore Fisheries \n47.  The status of stocks in the inshore fisheries and across the 410 customary fishing \nareas, or qoliqoli, varies markedly because the degree of fishing pressure is highly variable \nacross  regions.27  This  is  to  be  expected  given  the  differing  economic  forces  at  play. \nNonetheless, there are several general problems relating to management of the inshore \nfisheries that need to be resolved.  \n \n48.  As mentioned, some 895 boats operate throughout the inshore fisheries and hence \nmanagement and enforcement can be a challenging exercise. The key recent development \nhas been the development of a qoliqoli survey process (marine resource inventory) which is \nbeing undertaken by the Fiji Section of the Locally-Managed Marine Area Network (FLMMA) \nin conjunction with the DOF. Following on from this will be development of management \nplans which will include much more comprehensive use of management tools. Currently, \nthere is limited use of management instruments, including marine protected areas (MPAs), \nlicensing,  and  controls  over  fishing  methods.  Management  plans  could  potentially  also \nincorporate  area  closures,  protection  of  spawning  aggregations,  daily  catch  limits,  and \neducation processes.  \n \n49.  There are reports of extensive illegal fishing within inshore areas, including fishing in \nareas without a permit, use of dynamite (particularly in the western provinces) and cyanide \nfishing. The other management problems include control over the collection and export of \nbeche-de-mer and trochus which are both overexploited. There is a need for tighter controls \nover the collection of beche-de-mer and trochus and closer monitoring of exports to ensure \nthat export quotas are not being exceeded. Potential for increased utilization of management \ninstruments other than export quotas also needs to be investigated. \n \n50.  The recent inshore fisheries management efforts by the Fisheries Department appear \nto fall mainly into five categories: \n \n                                                 \n25 Davis, D. 2005. The Institutional Setting for Fisheries Management in Fiji: Need for Reform, Report of the \nInstitutional Specialist ADB Fisheries Sector Review, January, Manila. \n26 One such characteristic is that of a single species fishery, such as tuna. \n27 Quite simply we would expect more fishing activity in areas close to markets (ie., population centers) and near \nvillages where fish are caught for direct consumption. The director of Fiji\u2019s inshore fisheries management \nestimates that 70 qoliqoli are over-exploited, around 250 are fully developed and the remaining 90 qoliqoli \ncould sustain more fishing pressure (although it is probably uneconomic to do so given the distance from \nmarkets). These estimates would need to be checked but give some initial guide as to the variability of fishing \npressure across qoliqoli. ", "14 \n(i)  attempts to apprehend violators of the Fisheries Act, and those violations \nrelated  to  fishing  in  an  area  without  a  license  or  using  illegal  fishing \ntechniques  such  as  cyanide  fishing,  use  of  spear  guns  and/or  SCUBA \nequipment; \n \n(ii)  cooperation  with  NGOs  in  village-level  efforts  that  mainly  involve  the \nestablishment of MPAs; \n \n(iii)  processing applications for licenses for commercial fishing inside customary \nfishing areas;  \n \n(iv)  cooperating  with  other  government  agencies  to  comply  with  externally \nimposed requirements (CITES, US Government); and \n \n(v)  requirement  for  permits  to  export  fishery  products,  including  those  from \ninshore areas. \n \n51.  In  reviewing  the  inshore  fisheries  management  situation  of  the  DOF  (activities, \nattitudes,  and  capacity),  many  difficulties  are  evident.  The  Review  Team\u2019s  Fisheries \nSpecialist28 noted that:  \n \n\u2026 there seems to be some uncertainty as to the precise nature \nof fisheries management. Fiji\u2019s inshore fisheries are dynamic. \nMany significant changes in resources and fishing activity occur \neach year, but fisheries management responses to changing \ncircumstance  (if  any)  appear  to  be  sluggish at  best.  In  the \nFisheries Department there appears to be considerably more \nenthusiasm  for  increasing  fishery  production  from  inshore \nareas,  than  for  management  interventions  to  protect  over-\nexploited resources. This seems ironic, considering that many \nof Fiji\u2019s important inshore resources are either fully exploited or \nvery much over-exploited. \n \nCreating  an  enabling  climate  for  traditional  authorities  to \neffectively  manage  their  own  fishing  rights  areas  is  an \nimportant  role  for  the  Fisheries  Department  and  is  likely  to \nbecome  more  prominent  in  the  future,  especially  when  the \nownership of sea beds and reefs in customary fishing areas is \ntransferred  to  traditional  owners.  The  present  production \norientation  of  many  of  the  staff  together  with  their  weak \ncapacity in fisheries management suggests the management \nassistance provided to communities may not be very useful. As \nput by a recent report  \u201cthe Fisheries Department currently has \nlimited  ability  to  assist  rural  communities  in  fisheries  and \nmarine environmental management\u201d (University of the South \nPacific (USP)/Fiji Institute of Technology 2004). \n \n52.  The above issues present a number of challenges to the DOF.  Overall, it can be \nconcluded that the Department needs to be more active in inshore fisheries management but \na series of more specific recommendations (see below) flow from the above observations.  \n \n                                                 \n28 Gillett, R. 2005. Aspects of Fisheries Management, Legislation, Research, Development, Extension and \nAquaculture in Fij, Report of the Fisheries Specialist ADB Fisheries Sector Review, January, Manila. ", "15 \nRecommendation 3. In order to become more active in inshore fisheries management, it is \nrecommended that a firm policy is established that the priority for the Department\u2019s involvement \nin inshore fisheries areas should be resource protection, rather than the promotion of increases \nin production.  \n \n \nRecommendation  4.  It  is  also  recommended  that  there  be  a  requirement  that  the  major \ncommercial inshore fisheries (beche-de-mer, trochus, finfish gillnetting, spearfishing, aquarium \nfish) are actively managed by the use of management plans. Appropriate plans could address \nmany of the weaknesses in fishery management in the Fiji Islands. This includes promotion of \nmanagement oriented to objectives, assuring greater stakeholder involvement, transparency, and \nadaptation to changing circumstances. \n \n \nRecommendation 5 To support management of customary fishing areas, or \u201cqoliqoli\u201d it is \nrecommended that a number of management initiatives be introduced. These initiatives are as \nfollows: \n \n(i)  with respect to assisting in the management of customary fishing areas, the Department \nshould place priority on firmly establishing a policy that the protection of village fishery \nfood supplies is paramount; \n \n(ii)  the Department needs to create an awareness in communities of the need for, and \nbenefits  of,  fisheries  management  and  advise  communities  on  the  preparation  of \nmanagement plans and on reduction of perceived threats to the marine resources; \n \n(iv)  rather  than  the  fairly  weak  present  activity  of  \u201ccooperation  with  FLMMA\u201d,  the \nDepartment\u2019s objectives, and planning, should be based around eventually assuming the \nrole that FLMMA has successfully pioneered; and \n \n(v)  the  Department  should  actively  revitalize  the  system  of  fish  wardens  to  address \nwidespread problems of illegal fishing. \n \n53.  To support the above recommendations it would be beneficial to develop a fisheries \nmanagement white paper providing the in-principle statement on the goals of management, \nthe tools available to achieve management outcomes, and the processes to be used to \ndevelop, enforce and monitor management plans. \n \nC.  Aquaculture \n54.  There can be no doubting the enthusiasm of both the Government and donors in \npromoting aquaculture in the Fiji Islands. Conservatively, it is estimated that over F$25 \nmillion has been invested in the sector over the past 15 years, and there are plans to invest \na  further  F$8-10  million  over  the  next  2  years.  The  key  issue  from  the  Department\u2019s \nperspective is what its role should be in respect of aquaculture sector development, and how \nit is performing at present in respect of aquaculture management. To assist in this regard, \nwe focus on the Department\u2019s approach to aquaculture development, progress in developing \nsuitable legislation and management plans for the sector, and the merit of its attempts to \npromote small aquaculture farms. We also examine a range of issues relating to aquaculture \nresearch in Section V. \n ", "16 \n1.  Aquaculture Support & Subsidies \nAs mentioned in Section 2, aquaculture remains poorly developed in the Fiji Islands and this \nis despite financial support to the tune of many millions of dollars from the Government and \ndonors (Appendix 3).  Examples of the extent of recent support are as follows: \n \n(i)  at  the  height  of  the  seaweed  industry  in  2000,  658  farms  had  been \nestablished in 47 villages/settlements around the coast and maritime zone \nwith an average annual production of 300mt valued at F$275,000.29 Since its \ninception  in  1998,  Government  has  spent  over  F$1.8  million  in  direct \nSeaweed assistance to farmers with total production of 1,413.8 mt with an \nexport value of F$1.5 million. (In other words the value of exports is less than \nthe total subsidy) Production was just 24 mt and 48 mt in 2003 and 2004, \nrespectively; \n \n(ii)  Shrimp farming has been the recipient of more than F$4 million in support \nover the last 10 years but production remains low (currently about 1 mt);  \n \n(iii)  since 1997, Government has spent F$2.02 million in the development of \ninfrastructure and extension services to support the development of Tilapia \nand fresh water prawns. To date there are 300 fish farms of different sizes, \ncovering 48.22 hectares of land, but only17 farms are commercial; and \n \n(iv)  since its inception five years ago, the Government has allocated F$420,000 \nfor  pearl  farm  development  in  the  country.  And,  on  a  positive  note,  the \nindustry has had some recent success with production of over 30,000 pearls \nin 2004. \n \n55.  Overall, the aquaculture sector has been the recipient of substantial support and \nthere is much enthusiasm for the future of aquaculture in the country but the economic \nperformance has been quite poor. This is likely to be due to: (i) problems dealing with \nassessing  opportunities,  (ii)  development  interventions,  and  (iii)  underlying  governance \nissues.  Rather than continue with \u201cmore of the same medicine\u201d, the priority activity should \nbe promotion of objective marketing and feasibility studies. The DOF could contribute its \nfisheries perspective to efforts to improve the business environment in the Fiji Islands, \nincluding features relating to the tax structure, administrative blockages, investment, and \nland/marine tenure. More importantly, the Department should rigorously assess the benefits \nand costs of programs that support aquaculture and ensure that it does not fund projects that \nare unlikely to succeed. Funding provided should be commensurate with the expected future \nreturns  (taking  into  account  the  high  level  of  uncertainty  associated  with  aquaculture \ndevelopments as a result of: declining prices, risk of disease, problems in producing post-\nlarvae, and other difficulties in maintaining yields such as those related to sourcing of feed at \na reasonable cost).  \n \n56.  From the above information (and information presented in Appendixes 3 and 8) it can \nbe  concluded  that  there  has  been  considerable  aquaculture  work  in  Fiji  (marine, \nbrackishwater,  freshwater)  stretching  over  a  long  period  and  covering  large  variety  of \nspecies. The reality is, however, that aquaculture remains poorly developed in Fiji.  This \ncarries some suggestion that either: \n \n(i)  the potential and opportunities provided by aquaculture in the country have \nbeen over-estimated; or  \n \n                                                 \n29 Billings, G. 2004. National Aquaculture Sector Overview, December, Suva.  ", "17 \n(ii)  past aquaculture development work has been inappropriate; or \n \n(iii)  there are governance issues that negatively affect aquaculture; or \n \n(iv)  there is still need to remove impediments to growth (see Section VII). \n \n57.  The Department also needs to clearly identify its role and not venture into private \nsector activities related to the sector. For example it plans to develop six tilapia markets, but, \nclearly, tilapia farmers are best placed to supply markets if they consider there is money to \nbe made. In addition, MFF\u2019s plans to protect the shrimp fishery using subsidies should be \nscrapped as this represents a tax on the tourism industry and the shrimp fishery is already \nthe recipient of significant government support. The Department\u2019s efforts to promote large-\nscale aquaculture should focus on creating a facilitating environment, primarily formulating \nand implementing consistent and supportive policies (see Box 1). Additional activities should \ninclude  those  related  to  necessary  quarantine  measures,  and  liaison  with  traditional \nauthorities.  \n \nBox 1: The Facilitation Role of Fisheries \nFiji Pearls, based at Savusavu, comprises a large private sector development, one that will be an \n\u2018industry leader\u2019 and, potentially, underpin the development of a pearl industry in the Fiji Islands. \nOfficers from the DOF played an important role in facilitating negotiations between the proponents of \nthe investment and the Tikina from whom the farm area of 30 hectares was ultimately leased. Other \nroles for the DOF in a newly developing industry like pearls would be to advise villagers on how to \nbecome involved in spat collection, facilitate research into particular questions of importance to the \nindustry,  and  provide  information  on  getting  into  the  pearl  industry,  such  as  the  costs  of \nestablishment, operational costs and potential returns, the processes for negotiating with customary \nowners and obtaining a license, and criteria for selecting a suitable farm site. \n \n58.  Finally,  if  there  are  social  objectives  in  respect  of  some  aquaculture  subsidy \nprograms (eg., seaweed (outer islands development) and tilapia (food nutrition value)) then \nthese subsidies should be properly costed (including subsidies under the 1/3 \u2013 2/3 subsidy \nscheme) and the net benefits of such programs need to be evaluated in a rigorous fashion. \n \n2.  Promotion of Small Farm Sizes \n59.  The Department has indicated that 90% of pearl oyster farms will be small farms \nowned and operated by Indigenous Fijians. It is also actively promoting small shrimp farms. \nSimilarly, the Department is looking to promote satellite clusters of up to six small tilapia and \nprawn farms. \n \n60.  However  there  are  concerns  that  promotion  of  small  farms  could  undermine \naquaculture\u2019s viability in the Fiji Islands. There is a strong sentiment in the aquaculture \nindustry  and  amongst  regional/international  aquaculture  advisors  that,  for  some  of  the \ncommercially-oriented types of aquaculture, economies of scale are required to achieve \nprofitability. (This is hardly surprising given the large supply quantities and competitiveness \nof the industry). This has been expressed in a variety of ways: \n \n(i)  a large pearl farmer in the Fiji Islands has stated that a farm needs to implant \n50,000 pearl oysters each year to be viable (but the Department is promoting \nfarms  which  only  produce  1500  pearls.  Moreover  the  Department\u2019s  own \neconomic  modeling  has  indicated  that  a  small-scale  pearl  farm\u2019s  cost \nstructure will exceed the prevailing farm-gate prices of US$20/pearl); \n ", "18 \n(ii)  a tour of Fiji Islands aquaculture facilities in mid-2004 by notable aquaculture \nspecialists from regional and international institutions (SPC 2004) concluded: \n\u201cit was probably not financially viable for small pearl farms to operate\u201d; \n \n(iii)  the  SPC/ACIAR  Black  Pearl  Culture  Workshop  in  Kiribati  carried  out \neconomic modeling and concluded \u201ca small private sector (5,000 oysters) \nintegrated operation, culturing round pearls is relatively high risk\u201d; \n \n(iv)  experience in French Polynesia suggests that the small pearl farms are non-\nviable; and \n \n(v)  in  dealing  with  another  aquaculture  commodity,  marine  shrimps,  an \nestablished farmer in the Fiji Islands states that a minimum farm size of 10 to \n12 hectares is required for viability.  \n \n61.  Considering this experience, the Fisheries Department should reconsider its stated \nintentions of encouraging small pearl farms as stated in the 10 year development plan, and \npromoting small marine shrimp farms as indicated by some fisheries officers.  \n \n62.  Ideally, the only role for Government in determining farm location and size should be \nin respect of reducing the risk of disease outbreak and in controlling the impact of waste \nfrom aquaculture farms. Economic decisions regarding farm size and location should be left \nto the private sector.  It may be suitable for the DOF to provide information on appropriate \nlocations for fish farms given knowledge about environmental factors and how they affect \nyields but it should not make the final decisions on such matters. Information about efficient \nfarm size\u2014ie., the farm size required to minimise costs\u2014could also be provided to potential \ninvestors, along with information about how costs increase if farm size is lower than the \nefficient size.    \n \n63.  An additional suggestion is that DOF should focus on consolidating existing activities: \nprogressing current initiatives (tilapia, seaweed, and freshwater prawns) to the point where \nthey can be sustained without continuous government intervention. This should occur before \nexpansion of those activities or before promoting other forms of small-scale aquaculture. Any \nnew initiatives should be formulated mindful of (a) issues relating to economies of scale, and \n(b) the need for provisions for phasing out any subsidies (realistic exit strategy) so that the \nactivity does not terminate when government funding priorities change. \n \n3.  Legal Environment \n64.  The  present  legal  regime  is  not  adequate  for  aquaculture  development.  It  is \nsuggested  that  the  DOF  actively  promote  legislation  that  (a)  adequately  defines  and \ndistinguishes  aquaculture  from  capture  fisheries,  (b)  contains  provisions  for  a  licensing \nscheme specifically for aquaculture, (c) has appropriate environmental protection, and (d) \nestablishes property rights in the marine and coastal areas and the right to exclusively take \nfish in the farm area. An additional issue that needs to be examined is that of land tenure \nwith the current maximum lease period of 15 years being too short and representing a \npotential impediment to growth of the sector (Section VII). Legislation also needs to be \nintroduced to enable water leases (ie. leases from below the high water mark). \n \n4.  Environmental Management \n65.  A  primary  concern  at  this  point  is  the  absence  of  environmental  controls  and \nmonitoring with respect to aquaculture activity. The Department of Environment does not \nhave any capability in this area and this is a matter that needs to be addressed as a matter \nof urgency. The Department of Environment is a key stakeholder agency and should be ", "19 \nactively  involved  in  the  management  process  and  in  assessing  aquaculture  farming \napplications. \n \n5.  Assessment \nRecommendation  6.  On  the  basis  of  the  above  considerations,  recommendations  for \naquaculture are as follows: \n \n(i)  Develop  and  introduce  legislation  that  (a)  adequately  defines  and  distinguishes \naquaculture  from  capture  fisheries,  (b)  contains  provisions  for  a  licensing  scheme \nspecifically for aquaculture, (c) has appropriate environmental protection, (d) establishes \nproperty rights in the marine and coastal areas and the right to exclusively take fish in the \nfarm area, and (e) provides for water leases (preferably for periods of up to 30 years). \n \n(ii)   Develop a capacity within the Department of Environment to assess the impacts of \naquaculture. \n \n(iii)  Detailed economic evaluations of aquaculture programs need to be undertaken both \nduring  the  design  phase  and  evaluation  phase.  The  current  quarterly  performance \nreviews are not sufficient for this purpose. \n \n(iv)   Develop an effective and cost-efficient quarantine facility. \n \n(v)  Leave decisions on the location, configuration and size of aquaculture farms to the \nprivate sector, unless there is some firm environmental or disease risk management \nbasis for imposing such restrictions.  \n \n(vi)  If there are social objectives in respect of some aquaculture subsidy programs (eg., \nseaweed  (outer  islands  development)  and  tilapia  (food  nutrition  value)  then  these \nsubsidies should be properly costed (including subsidies under the 1/3 \u2013 2/3 subsidy \nscheme). Net benefits of such programs need to be evaluated in a rigorous fashion. \n \n(viii)  Plans to protect the shrimp fishery using subsidies should be scrapped as this represents \na tax on the tourism industry and the shrimp fishery is already the recipient of significant \ngovernment support.  \n \nD.  Marine Aquarium Fishery \n66.  Considerable progress has been made in developing a robust management structure \nfor the marine aquarium fishery. However there is some way to go in terms of ensuring the \nmaximum benefits from the existing management structure with some stakeholders holding \nthe view that the full effective operation of the structure is some five years away.30\n \n67.  There are still companies that have not developed management plans\u2014assistance \nhas been provided by NGOs (TRAFFIC and Marine Aquarium Council) but these companies \nhave not come forward and requested plans for their collection areas. Industry regulations \nshould be introduced that require all industry participants to submit plans for the areas they \nwish to collect in to ensure that the fishery maintains its non-detriment status and that there \nare no further bans placed on Fiji Islands exports by CITES. One potential problem is that \nnot all areas are subject to the one area/one operator guideline, reducing incentives to \ndevelop management plans. \n                                                 \n30 This reflects the recent establishment of all main components of the management framework, including the \nScientific Council, Fiji Marine Aquarium Council, and Marine Ornamental Traders Association. Each of these \nentities were established during the past 12-24 months. ", "20 \n \n68.  Guidelines for management of the Marine Aquarium Fishery have been drafted with \nthe  assistance  from  NGOs  and  are  awaiting  action  from  the  Solicitor  General.  The \nGuidelines provide some key controls over marine aquarium activities such as limits of one \ncompany per collection area (for greater incentives to conserve the resource), no collection \nactivity in front of hotels, and no use of crow bars for the collection of corals. The Guidelines \nhave  been  with  the  Solicitor  General\u2019s  office  for  some  months  now\u2014action  is  clearly \nrequired from Solicitor General\u2019s to enable the Guidelines to be formalized and there is no \nreason as to why this process should not take place within a very short timeframe given that \nno new regulations or legislation are required to support implementation of the guidelines. In \nfact it is questionable as to whether the Solicitor General\u2019s office should even be involved in \nthe process at all, raising the broader issue of whether the chief executive officer (CEO) for \nFisheries and Forests should not be able to sign off on management plans. \n \n69.  A continuing concern is that collectors/divers operate on a sub-contract basis and \ntherefore  are  not  directly  covered  by  existing  management  structures.  Further  work  is \nrequired  on  this  issue,  and  in  overseeing  continued  development  of  the  management \nstructure that has been put in place. TRAFFIC and an officer seconded to the Department of \nEnvironment to introduce systems to meet CITES requirements have been assisting the \nDepartment in developing management structures, but these NGO programs are scheduled \nfor completion in the middle of 2005. Moreover, the imminent departure of these NGOs has \nbeen raised as a potential risk factor in terms of continuation down the path of implementing \na robust management structure for the industry.  \n \n70.  Another perceived deficiency identified by industry participants is that the Scientific \nCouncil rarely meets to discuss management issues. \n \nRecommendation 7. Recommendations flowing from the above assessment are as follows: \n \n(i)  Given that the marine aquarium fishery represents possibly the best growth prospect for \nthe sector, it is recommended that additional capacity building programs be established \nto offset the effect of the departure of key NGOs.  This is important because growth of \nthe  sector  is  inextricably  linked  to  external  perceptions  about  the  effectiveness  of \nmanagement. \n \n(ii)   High priority should be placed on the assessment/approval of the Draft Management \nGuidelines for the marine aquarium fishery by the Solicitor-General\u2019s Office. The CEO of \nthe  Ministry  of  Fisheries  and  Forests should  directly  make  a  formal  request  to  the \nSolicitor General\u2019s Office on this issue. \n \n(iii)   Companies should be required to introduce management plans for their collection areas. \n \n(iv)    The  Department  needs  to  further  assess  ways  of  improving  management  of \ncollectors/divers. \n \nE.  Fishery Development Activities \n71.  Fishery development programs have focused on aquaculture (seaweed, shrimps, \ntilapia, and black pearl). In recent years, the DOF has also provided substantial assistance \nto small-scale fishers, including activities related to fish aggregation devices (FADs), training \nof fishermen for the revival of the deepwater snapper fishery, facilitating the establishment of \nthe LRFF fishery, small-scale tuna development, ice production, awareness training at rural ", "21 \nfisheries service centers (RFSCs), and building punts31. The National Fisheries Corporation \n(NFC) and RFSC program (discussed later in this report) are also intended to assist small-\nscale fishers. \n \n1.  1/3 \u2013 2/3 Subsidy Scheme \n72.  In the past few years much of the assistance to small-scale fishers has involved the \nprovision of free fishing gear. The 2003 DOF Annual Report states: \u201c31 identified small-scale \ntuna  fishers  were  assisted  through  providing  fishing  gears,  safe  affordable  and \nrecommended outboard engines and punts, under the small-scale subsidy scheme of a total \nsum of F$332,999.\u201d  The DOF\u2019s 2004 Quarter One Report states: \u201cIdentified and assisted 31 \nfishermen on a 1/3 and 2/3 basis\u2014provision of fiberglass punts, outboard engines, fishing \ngear, and safety components. Total 1/3 received is F$123,273\u201d. \n \n73.  The long-term development implications of such one-time grants of gear are unclear.  \nAlthough the subsidy scheme has been in operation for several years, no documentation \nwas available to the Fisheries Sector Review on any follow-up monitoring that would give \nsome information on the effectiveness of the scheme.  Given the expense of the program, \nsuch follow-up and analysis should commence in the near future. As small-scale subsidies \nare an area in which allegations of corruption are common, if such subsidies are to continue \nthere appears to be a need for greater transparency in the process.32\n \n74.  Moreover, broadly targeted subsidies represent an extremely blunt instrument for \nachieving fishery development and social objectives. Heavy reliance on use of subsidies to \nachieve  fishery  goals  is  symptomatic  of  a  lack  of  expertise  in  economic  and  policy \nevaluation. In addition, there is a concerning pattern with respect to failing fishery programs. \nThat is, after a program fails the DOF seeks to resume responsibility for marketing and to \nincrease vessel subsidies. These approaches, however, are likely to simply \u201cfurther extend \nthe pain\u201d rather than provide a cure.  \n \n2.  Fish Aggregation Device Deployment \n75.  The FAD program warrants some degree of critique as the program for deploying \nFADs has not been especially active in 2004. According to the officer presently in charge of \nFADs at DOF, the last FAD deployment occurred in mid-2003. FAD fishermen state there \nhave not been any FADs in the Suva area since late 2003, but that small-scale tuna fishing \n(including that promoted by the subsidy scheme) is not feasible without FADs. DOF officials \ncite the large expense of FADs and non-availability of a vessel large enough to deploy a \nFAD (or high charter costs of such a vessel) as reasons for the lapsed FAD program. \n \n76.  Some comment should be made on the value of FADs. Across the Pacific Islands \nseveral decades of small-scale fisheries development experience33 suggest that any country \nthat is serious about assisting small-scale fishers should have an active and well-managed \nFAD program. On this issue, the Fisheries Specialist for the Review noted that: \n \nOver the last three decades a very large number of initiatives \nhave been undertaken by Pacific Island countries to develop \nsmall-scale  tuna  fisheries.  These  have  included  deploying \n                                                 \n31 The aquaculture development activities are considered in a subsequent section.  \n32 MFF has advised (pers. comm. Miit Baleivanualala, CEO MFF) that cabinet approval has been granted for \nimplementation of criteria that would strengthen the governance of the scheme evaluation process and \nenhance  transparency.  The  Government,  however,  will  need  to  closely  monitor  the  application  and \neffectiveness of these criteria.  \n33 As detailed in the FFA Report \u201cDomestic Tuna Industry Development in the Pacific Islands: The Current \nSituation and Considerations for Future Development Assistance.\u201d ", "22 \nFADs, governments constructing appropriate small tuna fishing \nvessels, providing subsidies and grants for vessels and gear, \nproviding  hire  vessels  for  offshore  fishing,  encouraging \nproduction of tuna jerky and salted tuna, experimenting with \nnovel  tuna  products,  installing  freezers  on  outer  islands  for \nholding tuna, collecting tuna caught by outer islands fishers, \nestablishing schemes for purchasing tuna from artisanal fishers \nat subsidized prices, longlining from small boats, promoting \u201cika \nshibi\u201d fishing, copying Maldivian tuna fishing, promoting small-\nscale pole/line fishing with live bait, sponsoring overseas study \ntours, upgrading fishers to medium-scale longlining, and many \nother schemes.  \n \nIn  reviewing  the  history  of  development  of  small-scale  tuna \nfisheries, one of the few initiatives that has been successful \nand  continues  to  contribute  to  the  success  of  small-scale \nfisheries is the FAD.   \n \nDespite  decades  of  small-scale  tuna  development  efforts \nthroughout the Pacific Islands, FADs remain one of the few \ninnovations that allow small-scale fishers to economically take \nadvantage of the region\u2019s large tuna resources. This suggests \nthat  any  country  that  is  serious  about  assisting  small-scale \nfishers should have an active and well-managed FAD program. \nBy this, it is meant a FAD program that is financed by national \nsources (rather than dependent on volatile donor funding) and \nin which, as one individual stated, \u201ca lost FAD gets replaced in \n5 days, not 5 months or 5 years\u201d. \n \n77.  Moreover, a key indicator of the significance of FADs is that when there were FADs \noff  Suva  there  were  some  20-30  small-scale  tuna  boats  in  operation.  Since  the \nloss/breakage of the FADs, the number of small-scale tuna fishers has fallen to just six\u2014\nunambiguous evidence of the economic importance of deploying FADs. \n \n3.  Assessment \n78.  Examples of successful fisheries development interventions in small-scale fisheries \nby the DOF are not common, but they do exist.  A recent review of the situation in the Fiji \nIslands  was  less  charitable:  \u201cArtisanal  fisheries  development  programs  have  not  been \nsuccessful, largely because of poor planning, unrealistic expectations, and inefficient and \ncorrupt practices\u201d (USP and Fiji Institute of Technology, 2004). It would therefore seem \nappropriate to introduce some much needed reform measures, and we make a number of \nkey recommendations in this regard. \n \nRecommendation 8. On the basis of the above assessment, it is recommended that the DOF \nincrease the priority accorded to its FAD work, re-direct fisheries development funding from less \neffective fisheries development activities and, for a deployment vessel, either (a) explore some of \nthe small vessel FAD deployment techniques recently developed by SPC, and/or (b) be more \nenergetic in exploring vessel charter options. ", "23 \n \nRecommendation 9. With respect to any future work in fisheries development, it is imperative \nthat  the  DOF  strive  for  a  higher  degree  of  success.  Five  obvious  recommendations  for \nimprovement are: \n \n(i)  more rigorous technical and economic evaluation in the planning stages; \n \n(ii)  greater input from stakeholders in the Fiji Islands and from the regional organizations \ninvolved in fisheries;  \n \n(iii)  more  professional  and  impartial  review  of  fishery  programs.  The  existing  quarterly \nreviews are quite \u201ctokenistic\u201d and highly \u201cspurious\u201d indicators of fishery performance are \npresented  (eg.,  no.  of  kilograms  exported).  Proficient  officers,  preferably  from  the \nplanning  section  within  MFF,  should  be  commissioned  to  conduct  rigorous  annual \nassessments of programs; \n \n(iv)  reduce  reliance  on  subsidy  programs  to  achieve  fishery  development  and  social \nobjectives; and \n \n(v)  Introduce explicit exit strategies to phase out subsidies provided to specific fisheries. \n \nF.  Rural Fisheries Service Centers \n79.  A major component of the DOF\u2019 strategy for rural fisheries development is the use of \nRFSCs.  Two new centers have recently been established. A total of F$7 million was \nproposed in the public sector investment program 2004-2006 for RFSCs and F$1.6 million \nhas subsequently been approved in the 2005 budget. \n \n80.  This  represents  one  of  the  most  important  financial  commitments  of  the  DOF. \nBecause the RFSC model will have much to do with the success or failure of the DOF\u2019s \nefforts in rural fisheries development well into the future, some further examination of the \nsubject is warranted. \n \n81.  It is important to note that the RFSC concept is not new. Such centers have been \nestablished  in  PNG  (government  funding  and  International  Fund  for  Agriculture \nDevelopment),  Solomon  Islands  (EU  and  Japan),  Vanuatu  (EU),  Tuvalu  (Japan),  the \nMarshall Islands (Japan), and Tonga (Australia and Japan).  The Fiji Islands also had a few \nsuch centers in the early 1970s.   In contacting people knowledgeable about each of those \nprojects, certain patterns emerge: \n \n(i)  In none of those countries did the centers become self-supporting and most \nof  the  RFSCs  are  now  defunct.  Common  problems  are:  (a)  the  cost  of \noperating  the  centers  exceeded  what  could  be  supported  by  the  center \nbuying/selling fish, (b) ice is inherently expensive to produce in remote areas, \nand (c) the lack of planning in the early stages of the projects for the required \nlong-term subsidies. \n \n(ii)  In  cases  where  the  government  or  donor  was  committed  to  long-term \nsubsidies, over-exploitation of inshore fishery resources became a concern. \nIn extreme cases, the centers which were intended to help disadvantaged \nrural communities resulted in a reduction of food fish for those communities. \n \n82.  Although it could be argued that the Fiji Islands can be distinguished from the other \ncountries and conditions are more favorable for the viability of RFSCs, this does not appear ", "24 \nto be the case; no factors are apparent in the Fiji Islands\u2019 RFSC scheme that would result in \nuncharacteristic profitability.  \n \n83.  NGOs in the Fiji Islands are critical of the lack of conservation measures that parallel \ndevelopment attempts of the DOF, especially the construction of RFSCs. In looking at the \nsituation at the Wainikoro RFSC, the present efforts to counter possible over-exploitation of \ninshore fishery resources appear to be fairly weak: some plans to eventually encourage \noffshore fishing, and some attention to establishing MPAs. The present managers of the \nWainikoro center indicate that they are unable to even avoid buying fish that contravene \nfisheries legislation.   \n \n84.  On the positive side, there are some favorable experiences, aspects of which could \npossibly be incorporated into the Fiji Islands RFSC model: \n \n(i)  the use of existing/cheap transport for private entrepreneurs to bring fairly low \nquality fish to urban markets seems to work in some cases (Vanua Levu to \nSuva, Ha\u2019apai to Nuku\u2019alofa), but this does not involve the overheads of a \ncenter nor business complexities of a cooperative; \n \n(ii)  benefiting from the experience of many failed RFSCs, Papua New Guinea is \nnow using a revised development model in which government builds the \ninfrastructure (wharves and associated facilities) that the commercial fishing \nindustry needs to operate in remote parts of the country. This makes the \nlocation  sufficiently  attractive  for  the  commercial  sector  to  establish  and \noperate  fish  processing  and  distribution  facilities  in  those  places.  Once \ncommercial production is under way, products from the artisanal sector can \nbe  \u2018piggy-backed\u2019  onto  the  commercial  traffic.  However,  the  cost  of  the \ninfrastructure does represent a direct subsidy and costs and benefits would \nneed to be assessed before moving in this direction. \n \nRecommendation  10. Given  the  above  assessment,  it  is  recommended  that  consideration \nshould be given to modification of the Fiji Islands\u2019 RFSC scheme along the following lines:  \n \n(i)  although the RFSC model is predicated on the centers becoming financially independent, \nthis is not likely to occur. Accordingly, the need for an on-going subsidy should be \nacknowledged in the planning process, project documentation, Ministry budget, and how \nthe centers are presented to the intended beneficiaries; \n \n(ii)   in planning for RFSCs, much more attention needs to be focused on mechanisms to \nprevent over-exploitation of adjacent inshore resources, including the careful monitoring \nof trends in abundance of important species; and \n \n(iii)  full cost benefit analysis be undertaken before investing in further RFSCs, including \ncomparison with the net benefits of viable alternatives (eg., contracting out of required \nservices to private operators, use of a carrier vessel that could service any number of \nouter islands, and /or completely different ways of providing income support to outer \nislands). \n \nG.  Extension Officers \n85.  The DOF has a large network of capture fisheries extension officers. The extension \nofficer system was established several decades ago and (according to the 1979 Fisheries \nDivision Annual Report) the original purpose of the officers was to introduce new technology \nto boost production by the rural sector.  In the 2005 budget the section on \u201cExtension ", "25 \nFisheries  Capture\u201d  lists  31  established  staff,  6  un-established  staff,  and  a  budget  (not \nincluding construction costs) of F$1,127,000.  \n \n86.  Since the establishment of the fisheries extension officer system, there have been \nmany changes in the Fiji Islands including those affecting inshore fishery resources, fishing \neffort targeting those resources, the development of the private sector, and the types of \nproblems confronting coastal villages. A major issue for the DOF is whether the role of \nextension officers has evolved with the changing times or whether the services they provide \nare more relevant to a previous era.   \n \n87.  The staff of the DOF seem satisfied with the present role of the extension officers \nand indicated that a re-orientation to conservation/management work occurred in the late \n1990s.  Others outside the DOF, who are familiar with the work of the extension officers, \nbelieve differently. In discussions with individuals in other government departments, the \nFLMMA Network, other NGOs, regional fisheries organizations, international development \nbanks, and bi-lateral agencies, a strong sentiment emerges. There is the general feeling \nthat, with the rise in concern about over-exploitation and destructive fishing methods in even \nisolated Fijian villages, the fisheries extension role should be altered so as to be much more \nclosely aligned with conservation/management objectives.  \n \n88.  The Review Team\u2019s Fishery Specialist34 noted that that \u201cthe extension officers must \ncarry out a variety of non-management duties, but generally their major role should move \nfrom a development focus to a management one, with emphasis on advising communities on \nmanagement issues.\u201d  \n \nRecommendation 11. The DOF should assesses the merit of:  \n \n(i)  refocusing extension work to a management role with associated re-training of extension \nofficers in the management of inshore fishery resources (this is likely to be attractive to \nseveral donors); and \n \n(ii)   renaming  the  fisheries  extension  officers  to  something  like  \u201csmall-scale  fishery \nmanagement advisors\u201d to signal a new direction in the work of these officers. \n \n89.  The Review Team\u2019s Fishery Specialist35 noted that in Samoa the fisheries extension \nservice went through a transition similar to that promoted above.  According to individuals \nwho assisted the transformation, one of the greatest difficulties was the attitudes of the long-\nestablished staff. One of the most important factors influencing the eventual success was \nbeing able to start fresh with a sizeable team of new, young, enthusiastic fisheries officers. \n \n \nIV.  BENEFIT SHARING \n90.  Benefit sharing in respect of the Fiji Islands\u2019 fisheries needs to be closely examined \nto determine an equitable sharing of the profits from the country\u2019s endowment of marine \nresources. Benefit sharing in inshore fisheries is not a major issue at present because a \nbroad section of the community participates in the fishery. There are, however, potential \nissues relating to access fees paid to qoliqoli owners and an appropriate framework needs to \nbe  established  for  determining  \u201cfair  payments\u201d  for  access.  Taxation  issues  need  to  be \n                                                 \n34 Gillett, R. 2005. Aspects of Fisheries Management, Legislation, Research, Development, Extension and \nAquaculture in Fiji, Report of the Fisheries Specialist ADB Fisheries Sector Review, January. \n35 ibid. ", "26 \nexplored in respect of offshore fisheries which are currently subject to quite low access fees. \nConversely, input taxes, particularly the fuel duty, remain high.  \n \nA.  Cost Recovery \n91.  With the exception of the offshore longline fishery and the marine aquarium fishery \nthere is very little cost recovery from the Fiji Islands\u2019 fisheries. However, access fees are \npaid by the brackishwater and pearl oyster farmers and marine aquarium fisheries in the \nform of direct payments to villages and Tikinas. \n \n92.  At this stage, there are very limited prospects to increase cost recovery due to the \nlow  economic  performance  of  most  sectors.  A  necessary  first  step  is  to  reduce  the \ndependence of fishery sectors on subsidies followed by an evaluation of fishery performance \nto determine capacity to pay for management costs. Fisheries should be charged a levy \nbased on production value. The framework for determination of the levy will need to be \nclearly set out and explained to industry. A percentage of the levy payments should be \ndirected to the proposed Research Advisory Committee (RAC) (Section V) for allocation to \nsuitable  research  projects.  Peak  industry  bodies  would  also  have  a  role  in  allocating \nresearch funds. \n \nB.  Fisheries Taxation \n93.  In respect of fisheries taxation, the principal issues to be examined relate to the fuel \ntax,  access  fees  for  offshore  fisheries,  future  use  of  taxation  incentives  (which  is \ndiscouraged)  and  payment  of  access  fees  to customary  owners.  There  are  also  some \nadministrative  problems  which  need  to  be  resolved,  particularly  the  timing  of  VAT \nrepayments. \n \n94.  Industry has been quite vocal about the fuel tax. Revision of the fuel tax duty could \nbe considered by the Government but this should be coupled with a review of other relevant \ntax matters such as the current exemption on company tax for processors exporting fish (the \ndefinition of processor is quite broad and includes packaging).  \n \n95.  The fuel tax is also a significant cost burden on inshore fishers, and examination of \nthe issue would need to be coupled with an assessment of the subsidies currently provided \nto them. It may be appropriate to consider reducing fuel tax while also scaling down the level \nof subsidies for boats and equipment.  \n \n96.  The total access fees paid by the offshore fleet of around F$600,000 p.a. is well \nbelow the potential value of resource rent if the fishery is optimally managed. A recent study \nby FFA/SPC36 estimated fishery resource rent to be in the order of F$6 million for the \nscenario whereby the fishery is performing at maximum efficiency. Operators have in the \npast earned rates of return of around 35% on invested capital\u2014well in excess of a normal \nrisk adjusted rate of return, and indicative of scope to increase access fees in the future.  \n \n97.  It  is  imperative,  however,  that  any  introduction  of  access  fees  be  coupled  with \noffsetting tax reforms such as the lowering of fuel duty. A long-term view is required in \nsetting the access fees which takes account of environmental fluctuations (ie they should not \nbe set on the basis of catch rates and profits in a good year but should reflect the level of \nresource rent in an average year.)  \n \n98.  In  its  2004-2006  Strategic  Development  Plan  MFF  announced  an  intention  to \nintroduce further tax incentives for processing plant by 2005, with the objective of promoting \n                                                 \n36 FFA/SPC. 2004. An Economic Analysis of the Fiji Longline Fishery, October, Honiara. ", "27 \nlocal value adding and downstream processing for export. Providing a tax bias in favor of \nprocessing,  as  is  the  case  with  subsidy  schemes,  increases  the  chance  of  developing \nuneconomic enterprises that are dependent on Government support. Ultimately, due to \nsocial  dislocation  costs  there  is  considerable  pressure  on  Governments  to  continue \nsupporting  uneconomic  fish  processing  plants  (especially  if  they  helped  create  them). \nFurther,  as  is  the  case  with  Solomon  Taiyo  in  the  Solomon  Islands,  promotion  of \nuneconomic processing activity can lead to a dissipation of benefits from a countries natural \nendowment of fish resources. This scenario is to be avoided, and therefore Government \nsupport  of  processing  activity  should  be  restricted  to  supporting  of  HACCP  and  EU \nstandards and introduction of reforms that lower the cost of doing business in the Fiji Islands. \n \n99.  To fish in a qoliqoli it is necessary to seek permission from the provincial owners and \nto have a permit issued by the DOF. The principal change following enactment of the \nCustomary Fisheries Bill will be that Customary Owners will have direct commercial dealings \nwith those entities seeking access\u2014a process that will be administered by the Native Lands \nTrust  Board  (NLTB).  A  very  important  issue  is  the  establishment  of  a  framework  for \nassessing suitable compensation to qoliqoli owners for access to marine resources and for \nleases of their marine areas. Practical benefit sharing regimes need to be established and \nways of helping traditional owners learn about the commercial value of access need to be \ninvestigated.  \n \n100.  Operators have also complained of excessive delays in receiving value-added tax \n(VAT) refunds, with one longline company reporting a six month delay in receiving a VAT \nrefund of F$400,000. This places great strains on the working capital requirement for the \naffected company(s), particularly in periods when finances are already strained due to poor \nfishing performance and low tuna prices. Ways of avoiding future financial mismanagement \nby Fiji Islands Revenue and Customs Authority need to be investigated to ensure that VAT \nrefunds are paid in a timely fashion. \n \nRecommendation  12.  A  review  of  fisheries  taxation  is  recommended.  This  review  should \ninclude  assessment  of  access  fees,  cost  recovery,  and  development  of  frameworks  and \nprocesses for ensuring customary owners of qoliqoli receive fair compensation for access to, and \nutilization  of  their  marine  resources.  The  review  could  incorporate  economic  and  social \nassessments of the plethora of fishery subsidy schemes, as fishery subsidization is clearly an \nissue that is directly related to the overall benefit-sharing regime. \n \nC.  Indigenous Participation \n101.  There are a number of schemes operated by the DOF and by the Fiji Development \nBank (FDB) including: \n \n(i)  the Seed Capital Revolving Fund (SCARF) which provides interest free loans \nfor up to 35% of the capital requirement to successful applicants; \n \n(ii)  FDB concessionary loans which provide financing at the rate of 8%; \n \n(iii)  50% of offshore, EEZ and processing licenses are to be allocated to ethnic \nFijians and Rotumans under the Social Justice Act (to be achieved by 2020); \n \n(iv)  waiving of offshore fishery access fees for indigenous operators; \n \n(v)  the 1/3 \u2013 2/3 vessel subsidy scheme, which provides 2/3 of the capital cost for \nvarious categories of investment in the fishing industry; \n ", "28 \n(vi)  charter  and  joint  venture  arrangements37  which  are  designed  to  increase \ndomestic  participation  in  the  offshore  tuna  fishery  by  overcoming  capital \nconstraints; and \n \n(vii)  various other fishery development schemes (as identified above). \n \n102.  The focus of this assessment is indigenous participation schemes that relate to the \noffshore fishery,38 but many of the same issues apply to other schemes. \n \n103.  There are several measures in place to promote indigenous participation in the tuna \nindustry. These include reserving a number of tuna licenses and concessionary loans. These \nprograms have had a low success rate, however. Responsible officials in the DOF consider \nthat more of the same remedy is required (the maximum amount of loan from the Ministry \nhas been raised). On the other hand, some of the major participants in the industry feel that \nthe current programs are unrealistic and should be revamped to overcome some of the \ncommon problems encountered, such as mentoring to help with business difficulties often \nexperienced by Fijians. \n \n104.  Some of the affirmative action initiatives assume that lack of capital is the major \nconstraint  preventing  indigenous  participation.    Considering  that  the  Ministry  now  has \nconsiderable experience with seed capital, this may be an appropriate point to critically \nreview that assumption.  In reality, a blend of fishing skills and high level business skills are \nrequired to succeed in the fishing industry. \n \n105.  A number of the initiatives proposed under affirmative action would place restrictions \non the existing tuna industry. At least some of those restrictions may cause severe hardships \nto present operators without actually assisting in indigenous promotion. An example of this \nwas the proposal that the archipelagic zone be reserved for indigenous operators. This type \nof activity appears to be contrary to one of the basic principles of the Tuna Management and \nDevelopment Plan, that measures \u201cdo not jeopardize the current efforts by the present \nindustry stakeholders\u2019. \n \n106.  In  promoting  indigenous  Fijians  for  ownership  roles  in  the  tuna  industry,  less \nfortunate Indigenous Fijians should not be overlooked.  Chartering foreign vessel has been \nan affirmative action tool, but because many of these vessels operate with mostly foreign \ncrew,  deck-level  jobs  are  denied  to  unskilled  Fijians.    Considering  the  country\u2019s  large \nunemployment  situation,  ways  of  promoting  use  of  unskilled  deck  crew  should  be \ninvestigated. Currently, only around 50% of crew are indigenous Fijians. The effects on \nvessel performance of having Indigenous Fijian crew may need to be assessed. A system \nwhereby access fees are discounted by a proportion of the payments to Indigenous Fijians \nmay also have merit. \n \n                                                 \n37 Chartering of overseas vessels has apparently been instigated to assist entry of individuals who are short of \ncapital into longline fishing. According to Fisheries Department officials, the scheme was also intended to give the \nlocal charterers business experience in the tuna industry.  Individuals/companies who are presently chartering \nvessels  strongly  defend  the  scheme,  saying  it  is  providing  them  with  real  opportunities.  Many \nindividuals/companies in the Fiji tuna industry that are not involved in the scheme strongly oppose it, saying that \nmost of the charterers have no real involvement in the business, are not learning the tuna industry, the vessels \nimported for charter are driving legitimate local vessels out of business, and the money that the charterers are \npaid is really a charge on the fishing company for operating in Fiji \u2013 something that should not accrue to \nindividuals. \n \n38 The promotion of indigenous participation in the tuna industry is an established objective of the Tuna \nManagement and Development Plan, a component of the Social Justice Act, and is actively being pursued by \nthe present Government. ", "29 \n107.  The enthusiasm of the Ministry for promoting indigenous Fijians in longlining should \nbe tempered with some hard realities. In recent years in Fiji several of the longline fishing \ncompanies with experienced business managers from overseas and a long heritage in tuna \nfishing have collapsed, causing one to wonder about the chances of a less-experienced \nIndigenous operator. From a larger regional perspective, a report by the FFA on domestic \ntuna industry development in all Pacific Island countries39 is especially relevant here. It \nstated that for operating a tuna longline business: \n \nThe major activity is less about catching fish and more about \nmanagement  of  a  complex  international  business  in  an \nenvironment where there is much tough competition. Some of \nthe most spectacular bankruptcies in domestic tuna industries \nhave  involved  good  fishermen  who  made  poor  tuna  vessel \nmanagers. \n \n108.  Overall,  the  indigenous  participation  schemes  are  disjoint  and  in  some  cases \npromote inefficient industry structures. Costs are likely to outweigh the benefits in many \ncases and different models need to be compared and contrasted with the existing scheme \nfor the purpose of identifying the most efficient way of meeting the indigenous participation \nobjectives. We are not advocating termination of indigenous participation schemes, but there \nis a need for such programs to be grounded in reality, and very actively managed by \nskilled/motivated Ministry staff who have no compromising interests. The schemes need to \nbe constantly evaluated, and modified if the costs are outweighing the benefits (or if there is \na more cost effective way of achieving the same benefits). Moreover, further evaluation of \nFiji\u2019s policies for promoting indigenous participation should incorporate case studies on the \neffectiveness of affirmative action policies adopted to improve the welfare of indigenous \npeople in other countries such as Australia and New Zealand.  \n \nRecommendation 13. Given the above assessment it is strongly recommended that the Ministry \ncommission a major review of its approach to promoting indigenous participation. The review \nshould incorporate consideration of a rationalization of schemes, and impacts of indigenous \nparticipation  schemes  on  efficiency  of  sectors  and  growth  potential.  Ways  of  encouraging \nindigenous participation which have a minimal impact on economic performance of sectors need \nto be identified. \n \n \nV.  RESEARCH & DATA COLLECTION \n109.  Data collection and research are the foundation of good management decisions and \neffective policy development. It is therefore extremely important that the DOF assesses the \nexisting structures and systems for research and data collection, and considers the potential \nfor re-focusing its attentions towards the introduction of data collection systems and research \nprograms that will better promote the management effort. \n \nA.  Aquaculture Research \n110.  Much of the DOF\u2019s attention, and that of donor agencies, in supporting aquaculture \nhas  been  in  the  area  of  research,  with  Government  research  activities  amounting  to \nF$600,000 p.a.. Research relates to the culture of fish species, production of post larvae, \ndisease  risk  assessment,  and  genetic  modification.  Aquaculture  research  activities  are \npresented in the table below.  \n                                                 \n39 Gillett, R. 2003.

These species were imported from Asia. \nPearl Pilot Farm  100,000a Pilot farm for research, training and extension. \n \n111.  As  can  be  seen  from  the  above  table,  the  DOF  has  a  significant  budget  for \naquaculture research. Donor support for aquaculture has also been very extensive over the \npast 30 years. (Appendix 3). Current donor support includes ACIAR assessment of disease \nrisks for pearl oysters, while the University of Hawaii has just entered into a partnership \nagreement for research activities at the pearl oyster farm. The Department of Marine Studies \nat  USP  has  also  had  an  ongoing  role  in  fisheries  research,  with  current  involvements \nincluding  research  into  production  of  shrimp  post  larvae.  The  DOF  should  continue  to \nembrace programs of this kind but it clearly needs to help push donor support in the right \ndirection\u2014ie.,  into  areas  that  will  support  management  efforts  and/or  help  overcome \ntechnical constraints for development of aquaculture. \n \n112.  It is beyond the scope of this review to fully explore the effectiveness of the current \nresearch effort, but we do make some key observations: \n \n(i)  the Makogai Giant Clam Mariculture Project and inshore fisheries research \nshould  be  reviewed  in  the  near  future.  Ten  years  ago  the  Food  and \nAgricultural  Organization  of  the  United  Nations  (FAO)  recommended  an \nindependent  appraisal  of  the  Makogai  hatchery  and  mariculture  activities \n(Kailola, 1995). Apparently, this did not occur. Based on the lack of technical \nreports from work on Makogai, the stated nature of research being carried out \nat the facility, and enquiries made during the sector review, an evaluation of \nMakogai activities should be undertaken as a priority.  The attention presently \nfocused on biological and pure research at Makogai Island research should \nbe redirected; \n \n(ii)  the private sector has also questioned the performance of the Galoa shrimp \nhatchery and is looking to establish its own hatchery. The Fiji Islands is \nconsidered  too  small  to  support  two  hatcheries  and  if  the  private  sector \nhatchery proves more successful then an evaluation of the need to continue \noperating the Galoa shrimp hatchery may be required; and ", "31 \n \n(iii)  aspects of the operation at the freshwater research facility at Naduruloulou, \nsuch  as  the  supply  of  fingerlings  to  tilapia  farmers,  have  also  been \nquestioned. \n \nRecommendation 14. On the basis of the above observations, it is recommended that the DOF \ncommission an independent external review of (i) all operations at the Makogai research station; \n(ii) operations at the Galoa shrimp hatchery as this activity may be more efficiently undertaken by \nthe private sector; and (iii) aspects of the freshwater hatchery program at Naduruloulou Research \nStation.  \n \nB.  Data Collection \n1.  Inshore fisheries \n113.  A system for collecting statistics on the inshore artisanal fishery was established in \n1977 and a crude scheme for estimating production in the inshore subsistence fishery was \nformulated in 1978. The main outputs of these systems have been: (a) artisanal: estimates \nare made of amounts and values of finfish and non-finfish at the municipal markets and \nsome outlets on the two main islands, and (b) subsistence: for each year over the past 26 \nyears, estimates have been made simply by adding 200 mt annually to the questionable \n1978 production figure.  \n \n114.  In addition, the DOF maintains a database of fish exports (unverified) and a database \nof exports covered by CITES.  An important issue here is whether the outputs of these \nsystems address the critical need for information on the condition, trends, and potential of \ninshore fishery resources. It appears that this fundamental issue should be addressed before \nfurther institutionalizing the present statistical systems40. \n \nRecommendation 15. It is recommended that to improve the available data on inshore fisheries \nthe results of major projects aimed at improving the Fiji Islands\u2019 inshore fisheries data (three \nsince the late 1980s41) should be incorporated in official catch statistics.  There should also be \ngreater use made of the opportunity to monitor fisheries products at the point of export. Finally, \ngreater use should be made of surveys outside the fisheries sector: at little cost, production \ninformation on small-scale fisheries could be collected through such tools as the national census, \nnutrition surveys, agriculture census, household income and expenditure surveys, and poverty \nstudies.   \n \n2.  Offshore Fisheries \n115.  The Convention on the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish \nStocks in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean entered into force on 19 June 2004. The \nFiji Islands is a full member of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission \n(WCPFC) that the Convention established. Eventually most, if not all, of the coastal states of \nthe central Pacific and distant water fishing nations operating in the region are expected to \nbe members of the Commission. As one of the major objectives of the Commission is long-\nterm conservation and sustainable use of highly migratory fish stocks in the area, it is \nexpected the Commission will place controls on fishing effort and/or make catch allocations \n                                                 \n40 Budgetary requests have been made ($1,260,900 for 2005-2007) for such items as database improvement, \nhardware, and technicians to handle the information being produced by the present system. \n \n41 Cook (1986), Rawlinson et al. (1993), and the 1995 Fisheries Division survey of Vanua Levu.  ", "32 \nto coastal and fishing states. There is some thinking that one of the objectives of tuna \nmanagement  in  the  Fiji  Islands  should  be  to  look  beyond  the  immediate  situation  and \nposition the country favorably with respect to any such controls that the Commission may \nestablish in the future. \n \n116.  Related to the above is that the WCPFC will require the member countries to furnish \nvarious types of data. Other information on the tuna fisheries needs to be collected and \nanalyzed for domestic and regional purposes. The capacity of the DOF to carry out these \nactivities and the priority it assigns to these tasks need to be considered when formulating \nthe work plans of the DOF. \n \n117.  In these work plans it is also important to consider that some of the competent staff \nof  the  DOF\u2019s  Offshore  Fisheries  Management  Services  Division  are  likely  to  assume \nsignificant  Commission  responsibilities  and  therefore  have  less  time  available  for  tuna \nmanagement activities in the Fiji Islands.  In 2003 some recommendations were made to \nstrengthen the country\u2019s capacity to meet the likely data requirements of the Western and \nCentral Pacific Fisheries Commission (SPC 2003). These were: \n \n(i)  Further strengthen data entry and data management procedures. \n \n(ii)  Increase the level of observer coverage of the longline fishery. \n \n(iii)  Collect logsheet data from the domestic pole-and-line fishery \n \n(iv)  Develop the capacity for staff to analyse catch and effort data to enable \nroutine monitoring of the fishery. \n \n(v)  Introduce annual returns for vessel activity and vessel characteristics for all \ndomestic vessels. \n \n(vi)  Systematically collect unloadings data for all landings and transshipments in \nFiji Islands ports. \n \nRecommendation 16. The DOF should note the required improvements to the data collection \nsystem for offshore fisheries (see above) set down by the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries \nCommission and work towards aligning its data collection systems accordingly. \n \nC.  Marine Resource Inventories \n118.  For 2004 the budget for Marine Resource Inventory Surveys was some F$200,000, \nthe focus of which is the qoliqoli surveys which are carried out in conjunction with FLMMA \nand result in development of management plans for qoliqoli. The Surveys also incorporate \nsome socio economic assessments and development of MPAs using the community based \nmanagement approach  \n \n119.  A substantial portion of the work of the Research Division of the DOF has been \noriented to compiling resource inventories for the large number of customary fishing areas in \nthe country under the Marine Resource Inventory Survey Program. The Ministry\u2019s 2004 \nCorporate Plan indicates that 12 qoliqoli are to be surveyed and 12 management plans are \nto be prepared in 2004.  Although an enormous amount of time is required for this task, there \nis some question as to its usefulness to the target communities or in the management \nprocess.  The general concern is that the surveys are too comprehensive and need to be \nmore focused on the collection of information relevant to management needs. There is also \na need to focus on the qoliqoli most at threat and/or which have the highest environmental ", "33 \nvalues.  This  could  greatly  increase  the  effectiveness  of  the  survey/management  plan \ndevelopment process in managing risks associated with over-exploitation. \n \nRecommendation 17.  For improving the information available on customary fishing areas a \nshift in priorities is recommended. Less emphasis should be placed on undertaking resource \ninventories and, in accordance with the general priorities for the DOF\u2019s dealings with customary \nfishing areas (see Section 3.B), more emphasis should be placed on collecting information \nrelated to reducing the perceived threats to the marine resources. \n \nD.  Product Development \n120.  Research into product development receives a fair amount of attention in the DOF.  \nThe  2003  Annual  report  lists  \u201cproduct  development  for  tilapia,  carps,  prawns,  and \nornamental  fish  including  local  species\u201d  and  \u201cproduct  development  and  downstream \nprocessing of low value species\u201d, while the Ministry\u2019s Annual Corporate Plan for 2004 lists \n\u201congoing national research on product development\u201d.   \n \n121.  From a historical perspective, the DOF\u2019s many years of product development work \ndoes not appear to have been extremely fruitful.  On the other hand, the private sector in the \nFiji Islands seems better at identifying/developing opportunities and indeed had considerable \nsuccess (e.g. smoked fish products). This would suggest that the DOF should orient its \npractical product research to such topics as economic feasibility and marketing studies, \nrather  than  over  product  development  and  market  creation.  Inshore  fisheries  and \naquaculture research are associated with more difficulties and are explored below.  \n \nE.  General Assessment of Research Focus \n122.  The existing research program, research priorities, and the approach to research \nprojects need to be reviewed. Research activities should be driven by the demand for \nknowledge. Research is expected to provide information and knowledge that can be used by \nother sections in the management of various fisheries, along with provision of information to \nprivate fishers, whether involved in commercial or subsistence activities. Specific review of \nactivities such as the Makogai facility should be undertaken. \n \n123.  More recent research projects by the DOF are summarized in the annual reports. \nPresently, the DOF has significant involvement in research dealing with inshore fisheries, \noffshore fisheries, and aquaculture. This work is supported by both the DOF\u2019s budget and \nexternal funding. \n \n124.  From the perspective of the Fiji Islands Fisheries Sector Review Team, some of the \nmajor issues in fisheries research in the Fiji Islands are: \n \n(i)  whether the right research is being done: Is adequate research being focused \non obtaining the information lacking to make important fisheries management \ndecisions?; \n \n(ii)  whether the current research represents the best use of available funding; \n \n(iii)  whether the research results are being adequately reported and effectively \nused; \n \n(iv)  whether there is adequate oversight of the present research \n ", "34 \n125.  The Review Team\u2019s Fishery Specialist42 also identified a lack of responsiveness in \nchanging research focus: \n \nIn the Fisheries Department a persistent pattern in many areas \nof  the  work  program,  including  fisheries  research,  is  the \nsituation  where  staff  feel  quite  comfortable  with  certain \nactivities and consequently those activities are continued long \nafter  they  are  useful.  This  points  to  the  need  for  periodic \nexamination of the value of the fisheries research initiatives, \nrather than rolling over the same activities year after year. \n \nThe  concept  that  fisheries  research  should  be  oriented  to \nsupporting management objectives is not well-ingrained in the \ncorporate culture of the Fisheries Department. This suggests a \nneed to develop mechanisms to encourage the thinking that \nmanagement decisions can be improved through the collection \nof relevant information. \n \n126.  In addition, there is a large difference in opinion as to the condition and potential of \nthe  Fiji  Island\u2019s  inshore  resources.    This  uncertainty  could  easily  be  one  of  the  most \nimportant questions associated with the management of inshore fisheries resources in the \ncountry. Present research efforts to determine the condition and potential of the country\u2019s \ninshore resources appear inadequate.  \n \n127.  Considering the large need for such research, some of the inshore research subjects \nthat  have  received  attention  in  recent  years  seem  odd.  Included  in  this  category  are \n\u201cinvestigate the adaptability of culture technology of beche-de-mer species\u201d and \u201cconsolidate \nand fine tune turtle culture and rearing technology\u201d.43 Although it is conceivable that in the \nlong-term such research could produce findings that are useful, the technical results of such \nwork are not reported.44 This causes one to wonder about the value of such research to the \nFiji Islands and points to the need for regular review of research priorities and the need for \nadditional oversight of research work.  \n \n128.  The above observations point to the need for a more finely focused approach to \nresearch and aspects of the desired changes to the research focus are explored below. Due \nto the regional nature of the tuna resources, the great expense of tuna research and the high \nlevel of expertise required for data analysis, it is suggested that the Fiji Islands should \ncontinue  being  an  active  participant  in  SPC  regional  tuna  research  efforts,  rather  than \ncarrying out tuna research entirely on its own.  \n \n129.  It is recommended that research become a section within a new Division of Research \nand Advisory Services (Section VI), thereby emphasizing its role as a service provider, as \nwell as its close links to advisory activities. Research would be based on demand for \ninformation and knowledge and some would be outsourced. \n \n130.  Currently, there is virtually no capacity for economic or social research, or for policy \nanalysis and development in the DOF. Economic and social research skills are needed in \nthe  Research  Section.  Additionally,  the  Section  should  be  in  a  position  to  support  the \nExecutive Director of the proposed National Fisheries Authority (NFA) (Section VI) with \n                                                 \n42 Gillett, R. 2005. Aspects of Fisheries Management, Legislation, Research, Development, Extension and \nAquaculture in Fij, Report of the Fisheries Specialist ADB Fisheries Sector Review, January. \n43 These are listed in the Ministry of Fisheries and Forests Annual Corporate Plan 2004. \n44 This should not be construed as indicating that work on turtles and beche-de-mer is unimportant. It does \nsuggest that the more pure or speculative research should be done by global and regional research bodies and \nuniversities, rather than as a priority of the DOF.  ", "35 \npolicy analysis and development through the preparation of policy papers and other research \nactivities.  \n \n131.  To facilitate improved focus of research and greater accountability in the allocation of \nresearch  funds  a  RAC  be  established.  Membership  of  the  RAC  would  include  senior \nresearch  personnel  from  the  Research  and  Advisory  Section,  along  with  independent \nmembers, perhaps from USP and the private sector. Selected personnel from FFA and SPC \nmight also be invited to become \u2018visiting members\u2019 who attend RAC meetings whenever \npossible. The RAC would work closely with the Research Section to identify research needs \nand priorities, ensure adequate consultation with industry in developing research priorities, \nassist in seeking research funds, and monitor research activities. The RAC should review \neach research program annually, thereby ensuring its ongoing relevance as well as its \nappropriate focus. \n \n132.  In addition, emphasis should be firmly placed on use of fisheries research to support \nfisheries  management  and  development  objectives  The  requirement  for  fisheries \nmanagement plans for each of the major commercial fisheries in the Fiji Islands (Section III) \ncould be a powerful tool for improving fisheries research in the country. Such plans require \nstaff to articulate objectives, strategies for attaining the objectives, and any information \nnecessary in this process.  Quite simply, the obtaining of that necessary information should \nbe considered the priority research for the fishery concerned.  \n \nRecommendation  18.  To  promote  the  above  activities  it  is  strongly  recommended  that  a \nResearch Advisory Committee (RAC) be established to better prioritize research, provide the \nnecessary degree of technical oversight, and assure that the results of research are adequately \nreported.  \n \nRecommendation 19. Emphasis should be firmly placed on use of fisheries research to support \nfisheries  management  and  development  objectives.  This  is  to  be  achieved  by  explicitly \nrecognizing, and establishing, direct linkages between research and management plans.  \n \n \nVI.  INSTITUTIONAL SETTINGS \nA.  Key Institutional Issues \n133.  Three major institutional issues confront the development and management of the Fiji \nIslands\u2019 fisheries resources: \n \n(i)  the urgent need to review and revise the Fisheries Act;45 \n \n(ii)  the need to place the offshore fishing sector on a sustainable and profitable \nbasis through the design and implementation of an appropriate, transparent \nmanagement and licensing regime; and \n \n(iii)  the  need  to  modernize  the  DOF  to  enable  it  to  assume  the  role  of  a \ncontemporary fisheries management agency, focused on the core functions of \nfisheries  management  and  conservation,  as  distinct  from  the  production \norientation that typifies much of its present activity. \n \n                                                 \n45 MFF has advised (pers. comm. Miit Baleivanualala, CEO MFF) that a review of the Fisheries Act is in progress \nand the intent is to implement a revised Fisheries Act in 2006. ", "36 \n134.  There are, clearly, overlaps between these matters and it is important that they are \nconsidered  concurrently.  Similarly,  several  related  activities  are  occurring  in  policy  and \nlegislative development in other government departments and economic sectors that impact \non fisheries management. The design of new management and operational systems must \nalso take those into account. \n \n135.  The core institutional recommendations, discussed below, are as follows: \n \n(i)  Review and revise the existing Fisheries Act as a matter of urgency. \n \n(ii)  Introduce other important legislation relating to the management of fisheries, \nand implement management plans. \n \n(iii)  Modernize the DOF as a National Fisheries Authority. \n \n136.  It is also recommended to seek support for a capacity building program. The above \nrecommendations should be addressed in the capacity building program, along with support \nfor associated matters such as relevant training. \n \nB.  The Institutional Setting \n137.  The institutional setting refers to the policies, formal and traditional laws, regulations, \nattitudes and cultural norms and beliefs that guide an economic sector and its development. \nInstitutional structures are sometimes referred to as the \u201crules of the game\u201d. Consequently, \nthey relate closely to the enabling environment for the management and development of the \nsector in question. \n \n138.  The  key  aspects  of  the  institutional  setting  in  which  the  DOF  operates  are \nsummarized in Appendix 4. (Reference to Appendix 4 shows that the institutional setting is \nrelatively complex as it includes a range of diverse organizations, laws, regulations, roles \nand responsibilities.) \n \n139.  The DOF is one of the two departments of the MFF. The organizational structure and \nstaff numbers are illustrated in Appendix 5, where it is shown that there are currently 117 \nestablished staff positions, 44 non-established permanent positions, and 82 temporary non-\nestablished staff (at the end of 2004). \n \n140.  A  number  of  stakeholder  groups  are  involved  in  fisheries  development  and \nmanagement. The DOF is the lead government agency, although agencies responsible for \nmatters  as  diverse  as  environmental  management,  tourism,  planning,  taxation,  foreign \ninvestment, customs and quarantine, women\u2019s affairs, Fijian Affairs, and affirmative action \nalso have an active interest in the sector. Institutions such as the Native Land Trust Board\u2014\nwhich is responsible for the leasing of customary land\u2014and the FDB are also involved, as \nare official schedules like the Register of Native Customary Rights in which the rights of \nIndigenous Fijians are defined. \n \n141.  Customary  fishing  areas,  qoliqoli,  are  an  extremely  important  component  of  the \ninstitutional setting. The Fiji Islands are divided into 14 provinces, 189 Tikina (sub-provincial \nareas) and 1169 villages. There are 410 qoliqoli. A village community is made up of clans \nand sub-clans called Tokatoka, Mataqali or Yasuva. Resources are normally managed as \ncommon property. Both land and qoliqoli boundaries are surveyed and clan membership \nrecorded at the Native Lands and Fisheries Commission.46\n                                                 \n46 Bogiva, A. 2003, \u201cCustomary Marine Tenure: Implications on Community-Based Fisheries Management in Fiji\u201d, \nSPC regional meeting on coastal fisheries management, Nadi 17-21 March. ", "37 \n \n142.  Non-government stakeholders include the commercial fishers and fishing companies; \nartisanal and subsistence fishers; research organizations like the USP; NGOs such as the \nWWF, the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), and FLMMA; and regional organizations, \nparticularly the FFA and the SPC. Multilateral and bilateral development agencies are also \nimportant  stakeholders  in  relation  to  fisheries  development.  Organizations  such  as  the \nMarine Aquarium Council, which is focused on sustainable management of the aquarium fish \ntrade, and which certifies cultured products, also play a role.  \n \n143.  Industry associations are normally an important component of the fisheries sector. \nSuch organizations have not proven to be effective in the Fiji Islands, with a general lack of \ncooperation amongst participants in various sub-sectors. \n \nC.  Government Policy Stance \n144.  The principles that guide the roles and activities of government and its agencies and, \ntherefore,  its  institutional  structures,  were  summarized  by  the  ADB  and  AusAID  (1999, \np.15)47 who emphasized: \n \n(i)  placing the highest priority on performing the core functions of government \nwell (emphasis added); \n \n(ii)  limiting interventions to those that target disadvantaged groups or correct \nmarket failures, but only when it is clear that the benefits outweigh the costs; \nand \n \n(iii)  ensuring  that  interventions  are  implemented  in  a  way  that  makes  the \nmaximum contribution to poverty reduction and sustainable development. \n \n145.  A further principle is based on experience in the Fiji Islands where it has been \nevident that the nation can capitalize on emerging opportunities. The offshore tuna fishery \nprovides an example of the private sector identifying and developing an opportunity. The \nADB and AusAID (1999, p. 14) noted that, \u201cIn these circumstances it makes little sense for \nofficials or advisers to attempt to \u2018pick winners\u2019.\u201d  \n \n146.  Various policies that relate specifically to fisheries are discussed below. Two policy \nguidelines  that  apply  across  government,  and  that  reflect  acceptance  of  the  principles \noutlined above are, however, particularly important. These are: \n \n(i)  to provide a sound enabling environment for private sector activity. In its own \nCorporate  Plan,  MFF  notes  that  its  approach  is  \u201cto  create  and  provide \nwherever possible the social and economic environment in which the private \nsector can flourish\u201d; 48and  \n \n(ii)  to intervene only where market failure occurs or where the private sector \nshould not be involved.  \n \n147.  Again, MFF states that its policy is to be \u201cselective and relates only to areas where \nprivate enterprise should not or cannot invest\u201d.3  \n \n                                                 \n47 Asian Development Bank and AusAID, 1999.

Ministry of Fisheries and Forests, Fiji, p. 14. \n ", "38 \nD.  Corporate Objectives \n148.  In its Annual Corporate Plan 2004, Fisheries states its broad management objectives \nas: (i) to promote marine environment biodiversity and conservation of fish resources; and \n(ii) to promote and improve food security through availability and accessibility. In relation to \nthe tuna fisheries, the management objectives are outlined in the Tuna Management and \nDevelopment Plan that was adopted by the government in 2002, where it is stated that \u201cthe \nobjectives of the Plan are to provide for maximum sustainable benefits to the Fiji Islands \nfrom the resource.\u201d \n \n149.  Yet the DOF often does not, or is unable to (because of political pressures) follow its \nown Act, objectives or policy guidelines. This may be partly due to lack of professional \ncapacity  on  the  part  of  the  staff.  There  is  a  substantial  focus  on  increasing  fisheries \nproduction from inshore areas, many of which are known to already be over-exploited, rather \nthan on sustainable management of those resources and food security.  \n \n150.  Furthermore, The DOF is involved in commercial activity (and plans to become even \nfurther involved in such activity), has a substantial focus on inshore production and product \ndevelopment, intervenes even when market failure does not occur, does not weigh up the \nbenefits and costs of intervention, and often pursues strategies\u2014such as the RFSCs\u2014that \nhave a very poor track record throughout the region and which may conflict with food \nsecurity  and  sustainability  objectives.  These  problems  are  compounded  by  political \npressures, along with weaknesses in management, economic and social analysis, and policy \ndevelopment. \n \n151.  In the tuna fisheries a common complaint from industry is that the DOF regularly \nviolates the Tuna Management and Development Plan. Additionally, there is no effective \nmechanism for dealing with grievances and facilitating communication between the DOF and \nindustry. \n \nE.  Laws of the Fiji  \n152.  The laws governing marine resource use are laid out in Chapters 158 and 158A of \nthe  Laws  of  Fiji.  Chapter  158  is  also  known  as  the  Fisheries  Act.  The  Fisheries  Act \nemphasizes  the  role  of  Fisheries  Officers  as  the  custodians  of  marine  resources:  the \nimportance of management, conservation and sustainable use of those resources is the \ncentral focus of the Act. A number of regulations have been promulgated under the Act. \nThese  were  consolidated  into  the  Fisheries  Regulations  1992.  They  cover \nlicenses/registration, fees, prohibited fishing methods, prohibitions on the taking of certain \nmarine species, mesh limitations, size limits, and exemptions. The regulations were modified \ntwice in 1997. \n \n153.  In accordance with most such legislation the Fisheries Act is focused on regulatory \nmatters, including licensing, as well as on the powers of the Minister for Fisheries.  \n \n154.  Also  relevant  is  Chapter  158A  of  the  Laws of  Fiji,  which  comprises  the  Marine \nSpaces Act 1978. This Act establishes the archipelagic waters and EEZ of the Fiji Islands, \nand a 12 nautical mile territorial sea. Formal declaration of the archipelagic waters and the \nEEZ is contained in the Marine Spaces (Archipelagic Baselines and exclusive economic \nzone) Order. \n \nF.  Revision of the Act \n155.  The present Fisheries Act dates from 1942 and, despite amendments and additional \nregulations,  is  outdated.  Similarly,  the  Marine  Spaces  Act  is  25  years  old.  Since  their ", "39 \nintroduction, the Law of the Sea has been advanced in a number of ways, including the UN \nFish Stocks Agreement and, as of 19 June, 2004, the Convention on the Conservation and \nManagement of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries, to \nwhich the Fiji Islands is a signatory. \n \n156.  The Convention established the WCPFC, of which the Fiji Islands is a full member. \nParticipation means that the DOF will be required to furnish data and other information to the \nCommission. This is neither allowed for in the present Fisheries Act nor the work plans of the \nDOF. These are matters that must be dealt with in the near future, with particular attention to \nthe capacity of the DOF to meet the Fiji Islands\u2019 responsibilities to the Commission, while \ncontinuing with domestic management of the tuna industry. \n \n157.  The Social Justice Act 2001, the Customary Fisheries Bill 2004, and the Environment \nManagement Bill 2004 are also important to the management and development of the \nfisheries sector. The Social justice Act gives effect to the 20\u2013Year Development Plan (2001\u2013\n2020),  which  is  the  cornerstone  of  the  government\u2019s  affirmative  action  program.  For \nexample, in fisheries, 50% of offshore, EEZ and processing licenses are to be allocated to \nethnic Fijians and Rotumans under the Act. \n \n158.  The Customary Fisheries Bill is destined to become law in 2006 The Bill, when \npassed into law, will repeal Sections 13-20 of the Fisheries Act. The transfer of ownership of \nthe qoliqoli, from the state to the customary owners, is the basis of the Bill and this will need \nalso to be reflected in the Fisheries Act. \n \n159.  The Environment Management Bill 2004 is also set to become law in 2005. The Bill \nenshrines the requirement for environmental impact assessments into law. It binds the \ngovernment to meet the requirements of the legislation, rather than allowing discretion to \nmeet those requirements. Additionally, the environment legislation will take precedence over \nother  legislation,  such  as  the  Fisheries  Act.  In  the  case  of  commercial  fisheries, \nenvironmental approval will be required as a component of the granting of licenses. \n \n160.  Clearly, events have overtaken the existing Fisheries Act and, particularly with the \npassing  of  the  Customary  Fisheries  Act,  it  will  become  largely  irrelevant.  There  is, \nconsequently, an urgent need to review and revise the Fisheries Act (see Appendix 6 for \ncomments on the proposed Fisheries Management Bill). \n \nRecommendation 20. The Fisheries Act should be reviewed and revised or repealed. There is \nan urgent need to review and revise the Fisheries Act to take account of major developments \nthat have taken place since the existing Act was introduced (see above discussion). There is also \na need to include provisions such as those for aquaculture, management of artisanal fisheries, \nproperty rights considerations, the work of the Tuna Commission, proposed restructuring of the \nDOF (discussed below) and post-harvest handling. \n \nG.  Modernizing the Model for Fisheries Management \n161.  The premise for a revised approach to fisheries management in the Fiji Islands is that \nit should be based on a \u2018triple bottom line\u2019 approach. That is, fisheries management should \ntake  account  of  not  only  the  economic  outcomes,  but  also  environmental  and  social \nperformance.  This  is  the  approach  now  pursued  by  fisheries  and  other  resource \nmanagement agencies around the world. The model is also based on the need for the DOF \nto move from a production orientation to a resource management, conservation and service \norientation. \n ", "40 \n162.  Any model for fisheries management is, necessarily, based also on existing policies, \nlegislation and the structure of the sector. Furthermore, it is guided by attention to the core \nfunctions of fisheries management and the DOF. \n \n163.  With support from the FFA, a Fisheries Management Bill was drafted in 2002. The \nBill included provisions to repeal the existing Fisheries Act and, subsequently, to bring \nfisheries legislation up-to-date. The central feature of the Bill was the proposal to establish a \nNFA, although that proposal was restricted to a NFA that manages the tuna fisheries. The \nrecommendation outlined below, however, is that the NFA should replace the entire DOF \nand encompass the management of all fisheries in the Fiji Islands. \n \n164.  The proposed, revised model for fisheries management is shown in Figure 2, which \nis based on adoption and implementation of a NFA model for management. This approach is \nconsistent with government policy, which emphasizes the reorganization of the public sector \nto make it more efficient, transparent and accountable, and which also places focus on \npromoting private sector activity, with government bodies focusing on their core functions. \nRevisions to the structure and activities of the DOF provide a real opportunity for the CEO \nand Director of Fisheries to take a proactive stance, a stance that renders the DOF more \nefficient and effective. \n \n165.  The major feature of the NFA is that it is not controlled by a single public servant, but \nrather by a board made up of a variety of stakeholders, including representatives of the tuna \nindustry, inshore fishers, relevant Ministries and the NGO community. As the Authority is \nresponsible to the Board, the work of the Authority will become more aligned to wishes of the \nmembers of the board, instead of the often adversarial relationship that exists now between \nthe staff of the DOF and fishery stakeholders. This change will promote greater relevancy of \nthe work program, increased transparency, and a higher degree of accountability\u2014features \nthat are desperately needed at present.  Although the transition to an NFA-type arrangement \nwould represent a major step for the government, such bold action is required to address the \nmain problems associated with the DOF.  The move to an Authority should certainly be \nsupported,  but  in  a  form  somewhat  different  than  that  proposed  in  the  Fisheries \nManagement  Bill.  As  presently  formulated,  the  scope  of  the  Authority  is  limited  to  the \nmanagement  of  tuna  fisheries.  The  NFA\u2019s  responsibilities  should  be  expanded  to \nencompass  the  management  of  all  fisheries  (inshore/offshore,  aquaculture,  mariculture, \nconservation, live aquarium fish & corals etc.) in Fiji. \n ", " \nFigure  2:  A  Model  for  Modernizing  Minister\nFisheries Management in Fiji \nCEO/MFF\nMarine \nParks  Executive  Strategic Planning and \nAuthority  Director  Policy \nNFA \nCustomary \nFisheries  Board of \nCommission  Directors - NFA \nResearch \nAdvisory \nCommittee \nManagement  Deputy Director  Deputy Director  Deputy Director \nAdvisory  Fisheries  Finance &  Research &  Divisional \nCommittees  Management  Administration  Advisory Services  Offices \n\u2022 Management of  \u2022 Records  \u2022 Research Section \ncommercial  management  \u2022 Advisory Section   Advisory \nfisheries  \u2022 Information  \u2022 Information Section  Officers \n\u2022 Corporate &  systems  (cid:131) Communication & \ncommunity  \u2022 Human resources  training strategy \nrelations  planning &  (cid:131) Aquaculture \n\u2022 Licensing  management  (cid:131) Finfish \n\u2022 Surveillance  \u2022 Internal  (cid:131) Invertebrates \n\u2022 Monitoring  communication  (cid:131) Stock Assessment \n\u2022 Enforcement  \u2022 Finance/budget  (cid:131) Conservation & \n\u2022 Observer  \u2022 Administration  habitat protection \nprograms  (cid:131) Commercial, \nsubsistence & \n\u2022 Data collection & \nanalysis  recreational \nfisheries \n \n \n ", " \n \n166.  The  policy  of  the  Government  to  commercialize,  reorganize  or  privatize  its  24 \nministries is relevant here. The Ministry of Public Enterprises and Public Sector Reform \n(MPEPSR) is responsible for this policy and its implementation (Box 2). Currently, MFF is \ngiven a priority of \u201cEarly to Medium\u201d for commercialization. The first step is for Cabinet to \ndeclare a ministry as a \u201creorganization entity under the Public Enterprise Act.\u201d When a \nMinistry is declared for reorganization, MPEPSR prepares\u2014or has prepared\u2014a charter that \nspells out the required actions and the timetable for reorganization. \n \nBox 2: Reform Role of Ministry of Public Enterprises and Public Sector Reform \n \n \nIn Cabinet Decision No. 522 of 15/10/2004, Cabinet (i) noted the benefits of having a central \n \ncoordinating Ministry to implement the Public Sector Reform Programme; (ii) agreed that the \n \nMinistry of Public Enterprises and Public Sector Reform be the Ministry responsible for the \n  implementation of the Public Enterprises and Public Sector Reform; (iii) agreed that the Ministry \n  of Public Enterprises and Public Sector Reform be part of the Central Agency network of \n  Government; and (iv) directed that all  Ministries and Departments are to fully cooperate and \n  assist in the reform program, initiatives and actions pursued by the Ministry of Public Enterprises \n  and Public Sector Reform.  \n \n \n167.  At present, the DOF is poorly focused in terms of core functions. Furthermore, the \nweak linkages between various sections of the DOF hinder its functionality. There is an \nurgent need to reorganize and modernize the DOF, preferably through the process laid out \nby MPEPSR. \n \n168.  The proposed model for fisheries management is focused on resource management, \nas emphasized in the Fisheries Act, rather than on production activities. It would emphasize \nthe DOF\u2019 role to facilitate rather than prescribe industry development. The model endorses \nincreased cooperation between the private and public sectors, particularly through initiatives \nsuch as the establishment of Management Advisory Committees. Additionally, it is based on \ngovernment policies that: (i) endorse a greater role for the private sector and government \nintervention  only  where  private  sector  activity  is  inappropriate  or  unlikely;  (ii)  promote \nsustainable use of the natural resources of the Fiji Islands; and (iii) encourage transparent \nmanagement systems. \n \nRecommendation 21. The Government should support modernization of the DOF, leading to the \nestablishment of the NFA, with a Board comprised of a mix of stakeholders. The NFA should \nfacilitate industry involvement in fisheries management through the formation of Management \nAdvisory Committees (MACs) for each fishery. The successful approach adopted in Papua New \nGuinea could be used as a model on which to establish the NFA. The NFA would have three \nDivisions: (i) Finance and Administration; (ii) Management Services; and (iii) Research and \nAdvisory Services. Each would be headed by a Deputy Director49.  \n \n169.  The establishment of the NFA would require revision of the Fisheries Act, and this \nshould  be  the  first  step  in  the  reorganization  process.  A  timetable  for  the  phased \nreorganization  of  the  DOF  into  a  NFA  should  also  be  developed,  a  task  that  can  be \nfacilitated by MPEPSR.  \n \n                                                 \n49 This proposed structure will need to be reviewed and refined in consultation between the Department of \nFisheries and MPEPSR. This would be best undertaken during the proposed capacity building TA (see \nSection 6.J below). ", "43 \n170.  In the initial stages of implementation the NFA would concentrate on improving \nefficiency,  implementing  internal  management  and  control  systems,  and  establishing \ntransparent procedures and processes. Its statutory management functions of licensing, \nsurveillance, enforcement, data collection and monitoring would continue from the current \nDOF, while its other functions would be established and replace existing DOF structures and \napproaches. \n \n1.  Finance and Administration \n171.  The Finance and Administration Division would have responsibility for budgeting, \nfinancial management and staffing, including human resource planning, management and \ndevelopment. It would develop an internal communication strategy and ensure strong and \nappropriate  linkages  between  the  different  Divisions  in  the  organization.  Finance  and \nAdministration would also play an important role in servicing the Board of NFA and the \nCustomary  Fisheries  Commission,  providing  a  secretariat  service  to  these  bodies.  It  is \nrecommended  that  the  Fleet  and  Technical  Services  section  of  the  existing  DOF  be \nincorporated into Finance and Administration, but that a timetable is established to phase out \nfleet and technical services. \n \n2.  Management Services \n172.  This is a core function for the DOF, currently undertaken by the Management and \nTechnical Services section. It would be given greater prominence in the NFA. The Board of \nNFA  would  be  responsible  for  the  licensing  of  offshore  fisheries,  although  the  actual \nservices, along with the observer program and monitoring would be carried out by the \nDivision of Management Services. The Division would also collect, collate and analyze data \nfor all fisheries. These data will be of value to the Board and to policy makers for developing \npolicies  and  management  strategies  that  support  the  sustainable  management  of  the \ncountry\u2019s fisheries. \n \n173.  As  noted  previously,  management  plans  need  to  be  developed  for  each  major \ncommercial fishery, with Management Advisory Committees (MACs) established for each of \nthose fisheries. The management plans relate closely to licensing, so the MACs will need to \ndevelop a strong working relationship with the Management Division of the DOF. \n \n174.  Management Services would also provide professional support to the Customary \nFisheries Commission, which will be charged with the responsibility for licensing inshore \ncommercial fishing activities under the Customary Fisheries Act. \n \n3.  Research and Advisory Services \n175.    Currently,  the  DOF  devotes  around  63%  of  its  budget  to  supporting  two \nextension sections: Capture Development and Extension, and Aquaculture Development. \nStaff members in these sections are heavily involved in production-oriented activities and \nattempts to develop new industries. They are also involved in the subsidized operation of the \nRFSCs, a shrimp hatchery, development of tilapia farming, a pilot pearl farm, and a range of \nother activities. Staff members are also responsible for the subsidy program of the DOF. \n \n176.  There has been some move towards greater involvement in resource management \nactivities in recent years, particularly through cooperation with NGOs such as FLMMA, and \nin 2005 the DOF takes over the role of coordinator of FLMMA. \n \n177.  Nonetheless, as discussed in Section III, there remains an overwhelming need to \nrefocus the work of extension service personnel away from production focused activities to \nactivities where information, advice and local training are provided to assist fishers to make ", "44 \ndecisions  about  their  activities.  The  facilitation  role  of  advisory  officers  would  be \nemphasized.  Their  activities  should  be  much  more  closely  aligned  with  the  current \nmanagement and conservation objectives of the DOF. \n \nRecommendation  22.  The  existing  Capture  Development  and  Extension,  and  Aquaculture \nDevelopment sections should be brought together into one Advisory Section within the Research \nand Advisory Division. The existing Training and Education Section should also be brought into \nadvisory services as an Information Section. \n \n178.  The existing Training and Education Section would become an enlarged \u2018Information \nSection\u2019 within Advisory and Research Services. It would have responsibility for train-the-\ntrainer  activities,  as  well  as  for  developing  advisory  materials  in  a  format  suitable  for \nwidespread public use. These materials might include posters, brochures, videos, radio \nbroadcasts, and so on. They would also be supported by local-level field days and training \nactivities. \n \n179.  The Information Section will need to be resourced at a sufficient level to allow it to \neffectively meet its responsibilities. A priority activity for this section will be the preparation of \na communication strategy for the NFA. This section would also be the main link with the \nNational Fisheries Training Center\u2014discussed below\u2014if such a Center is established. \n \n180.  The preferred approach taken by Advisory Officers to their revised roles is that of \nparticipatory learning and action.50 Furthermore, their activities can be enhanced by forming \ncollaborative partnerships with NGOs, other organizations, and fishers. \n \nH.  Other Proposed Initiatives \n181.  Two other initiatives proposed by the Ministry of Fisheries and Forestry should be \ndealt with briefly.  \n \n182.  The first initiative is the NFC. A major concern with this proposal is that, as the \ncountry\u2019s  fisheries  are  approaching  a  stage  of  full  development,  any  commercial \nopportunities pursued by NFC would inevitably involve crowding out the private sector. It is \nna\u00efve  to  assume  that  the  NFC  could  \u201coperate  complementary  to  existing  commercial \nactivities\u201d.  It also seems unrealistic that unspecified \u201cstrategic relationships\u201d will somehow \nenable the NFC to fulfill its objectives.  \n \n183.  It is recognized that one of the aims of the NFC is the promotion of indigenous Fijian \nparticipation  in  the  fisheries  sector.    Considering  the  past  disastrous  experience  with \ngovernment fishing companies in the Pacific Islands (including the Fiji Islands), the large \ncost of such undertakings, and the possibility of crowding out the private sector (which may \nrepresent the most sustainable avenue for indigenous participation), the conclusion that NFC \ncould be an effective tool for affirmative action seems unwarranted.   \n \n184.  Of relevance to the establishment of NFC is the general subject of government \ninvolvement in fishing, which was explored in a study in 2002 by the FFA. The report stated: \n\u201cThere  appeared  to  be  a  remarkable  change  in  attitude  by  fisheries  officers  towards \ngovernment commercial involvement.  Learning from past difficulties, most of the fisheries \nofficers  encountered  expressed  the  sentiment  that  the  government  should  refrain  from \ncommercial involvement and focus on improving the policy environment.  With respect to \nactual commitment, it appears that in many countries, efforts have largely changed from \n                                                 \n50 This method is described by Langi, Qauqau and Korvulavula (2001) in Enhancing the Management of the I \nQoliqoli: A Manual for Fisheries Officers in Fiji. FAO report to the Department of Fisheries. ", "45 \npromoting state enterprises to encouraging domestic private sector fishing and, secondarily, \nforeign involvement in other aspects of the tuna industry.\u201d \n \nRecommendation 23.  It is strongly recommended that the proposal to establish a National \nFisheries Corporation (NFC) be strenuously opposed. The proposal is clearly at odds with stated \ngovernment policy on private sector facilitation and development, runs counter to the very poor \nexperience with government activity in the commercial aspects of fisheries both regionally and \nwithin the Fiji Islands, is outside the core functions of a modern fisheries management agency, \nwill almost certainly crowd out the private sector in most aspects of fisheries, and is not based on \na genuine need to overcome market failure or inappropriate private sector activity. \n \n185.  The second initiative is that of the establishment of a National Fisheries Training \nCenter (NFTC). A feasibility study was undertaken in respect of this proposal by USP and \nthe Fiji Institute of Maritime Studies in 2004.51\n \n186.  Amongst the key findings of the feasibility study were: (i) a NFTC is both feasible and \ndesirable; (ii) the NFTC should be allied to, but independent of government; (iii) there should \nbe strong linkages to the DOF and to other government ministries and departments, possibly \nas a corporation or statutory authority; (iv) there should be strong linkages to the fishing \nindustry through board membership and advisory committees; and (v) the NFTC should be \nmanaged by an independent board. It is also noted that a new facility is not required, but, \nrather, there are existing underutilized buildings available for use. \n \n187.  The conclusions of the USP/Institute of Marine Studies are supported. However, \nthere are more pressing matters confronting the DOF\u2014revising the Fisheries Act, licensing \nin the tuna fisheries, and modernizing the DOF\u2014that should be given greater priority than \nthe establishment of a NFTC. \n \n188.  It is also relevant to note that during workshops with DOF staff a common grievance \nof graduate policy officers was the difficulty in receiving feedback from supervisors. In some \ninstances, the level of motivation and drive of graduate recruits greatly exceeded that of their \nsuperiors. Team building exercises may be required to address problems of this kind. A real \nconcern is that some of the more talented recent recruits will be lost to higher paying jobs in \nthe private sector if they are not presented with a more invigorating and dynamic work \nenvironment and provided with suitable direction.  \n \nI.  Marine Parks Authority \n189.  In keeping with the increased focus on conservation and management activities, the \nDOF has become more involved with organizations such as FLMMA. The drive for a system \nof MPAs has come largely from  communities and NGOs, with active support from the \nEnvironment Department. The DOF also has significant expertise to assist the development \nof protected areas. More coordination is, however, needed in this area.  \n \n190.  The  Government  should  investigate  the  potential  to  establish  a  Marine  Parks \nAuthority or Marine Protected Areas Authority. The Authority would preferably involve a \npartnership between the DOF, the Department of Environment, and NGOs. The actual \nAuthority might comprise only three to five members, and be chaired by either the Executive \nDirector of the NFA or the Director of the Environment Department. The Authority would \nmake decisions on work programs and the establishment of a network of MPAs, and would \n                                                 \n51 USP Marine Studies Programme, and  School of Maritime Studies, Fiji Institute  of Technology (2004), \nFeasibility Study for the Establishment of a National Fisheries Training Center in the Fiji Islands. Submitted to \nMFF, October 2004. ", "46 \nalso apportion the technical work between Fisheries and Environment staff on an agreed \nbasis. Such an approach to the management of MPAs has been implemented successfully \nin other international jurisdictions. For example, this approach is adopted in New South \nWales,  although  there  is  a  statutory  requirement  for  the  Executive  Director  of  the \nDepartment of Premier and Cabinet to head the Marine Parks Authority, and secretariat \nsupport is jointly provided by the Department of Primary Industries (Fisheries), and the \nDepartment of Environment and Heritage.  \n \n191.  One of the reasons for the trend away from Marine Parks management being solely \ngoverned by fisheries departments is that this does not create an even balance between \nenvironment and development objectives. Also, many of the central policy issues relating to \nmarine park management cut across the fisheries and environment portfolios. In summary, \npriority should be given to examining the Marine Parks Authority model, but, in terms of \nreform sequencing it would seem appropriate to introduce the NFA first, and then examine \noptions for establishing a MPA. \n \nJ.  Capacity Building \n192.  The  major  needs  facing  the  DOF  are  reorganization  and  capacity  development, \nincluding all the elements of such development: institutional, organizational and human \nresources  development.  The  focus  should  be  on  transforming  the  DOF  into  a  modern \nfisheries management agency. The need for reorganization and capacity development arises \nalso from the many changes that are presently being implemented in the Fiji Islands, such as \nthe Customary Fisheries Bill, and the pressing need to develop and implement an efficient \nlicensing system for the offshore fisheries.  It is also worth mentioning that there is a paucity \nof well worked policy papers to assess management options and this is a direct reflection of \nthe limited capacity within the DOF. \n \nRecommendation  24.  It  is  strongly  recommended  that  the  DOF  seeks  Capacity  Building \nTechnical Assistance (TA) from a donor organization. The TA would support restructuring of the \nDOF,  its  refocusing  as  a  modern  conservation  and  management  agency,  revision  of  the \nFisheries Act, a revised approach to tuna management and licensing, and strengthening of \nhuman  resource  capabilities  through  targeted  training.  Three  specialists  are  required:  one \neconomist,  one  fisheries  policy  specialist,  and  one  expert  in  community-based  fisheries \nmanagement. The duration of the program, given the large-scale reform requirements, should be \nfor a period of two years. \n \n193.  To be effective in instilling the necessary reforms any donor\u2019 support of such a TA \nshould be conditional upon the following requirements being met: \n \n(i)  agreement by the government to reorganize the DOF, preferably under the \nreorganization process facilitated by MPEPSR; \n \n(ii)  abandoning the NFC proposal; \n \n(iii)  commitment  to  reorienting  the  focus  of  fisheries  research  and  extension \nactivities  to  resource  management  and  service  provision,  rather  than \nproduction and product development; \n \n(iv)  formulation and implementation of a plan and timetable to review the DOF\u2019s \ncommercial  activities,  with  a  view  to  appropriate  divestment,  including  its \nFleet and Technical Services; \n ", "47 \n(v)  agreement to make greater use of outsourcing of technical services, research \nand education (eg., using a mechanism such as the RAC); \n \n(vi)  formal commitment to adhere to the Tuna Management and Development \nPlan, including application of a firm policy on license limits for the offshore \nfishery; \n \n(vii)  commissioning  of  a  rigorous  cost  benefit  study  of  the  proposed  regional \nservice  centre\u2014this  study,  for  which  it  is  recommended  that  funding  be \nprovided by the ADB, would be undertaken by an independent entity with no \ndirection placed on the consultants in respect of the report findings; and \n \n(viii)  adoption of a more rigorous process for program evaluation. \n \n194.  Consideration should also be given to requesting a loan (or grant from FDB if less \nthan  $1  million  and  for  management  purposes)  from  a  donor  organization  to  support \nredundancy packages, if required, in a reorganized the DOF. This would support a process \nof making all key positions contestable so that new positions within the NFA are filled on a \nmerit basis. The Government\u2019s loan commitments to support the redundancy packages \nwould be more than offset by improvements in the efficiency of fisheries if this successfully \npromotes a strong move in the direction of best practice. \n \n195.  Other elements of the capacity building TA would include: (i) training for extension \nofficers in communication skills, advisory methods, financial analysis, and the formulation of \nconservation and management programs; (ii) a skills audit, leading to other training deemed \nnecessary, such as training in economic analysis, environmental management, and policy \nanalysis  and  development;  (iii)  attachments  to  fisheries management  agencies in  other \nnations; and (iv) strengthening of the training and education section and supporting its \nconversion to an effective Information Service. \n \n196.  Clearly,  an  important  role  for  the  TA  would  be  to  support  greater  coordination \namongst the many activities underway or required of the DOF. For example, revision of the \nFisheries  Act  needs  to  be  harmonized  with  the  review  of  the  Tuna  Management  and \nDevelopment Plan, the development of the Customary Fisheries Act and the Environment \nManagement  Act,  development  and  implementation  of  a  new  licensing  system  for \ncommercial fisheries, and the reorganization of the DOF into the NFA. \n \n197.  In  addition  to  developing  its  own  economics  capacity,  the  Ministry  should  be \nencouraged to draw on the availability of world-class natural resource specialists in the \nregion. Contracting out of key economic and social assessment studies to agencies such as \nthe Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and other research entities \nand consulting firms is standard practice for most natural resource managers in Australia. It \nwould seem logical for Fiji to adopt a similar approach (albeit in a manner that is coordinated \nwith the efforts of regional research entities such as SPC and FFA). \n \n198.  Finally, it may also be appropriate for certain fisheries activities to be considered for \ninclusion in the proposed Outer Island Development Project to be supported by ADB. This \nmight  include  infrastructure  needed  to  support  various  fisheries  activities.  It  might  also \ninclude  investment  in  new  port  facilities  in  Suva  to  reduce  the  overcrowding  currently \nexperienced by fishing vessels.  \n \n \n ", "48 \nVII.  SECTOR GROWTH \n199.  MFF has set down a F$258 million investment program to stimulate sector growth \nand, as mentioned, has set down a growth target of F$500 million for the sector. The \ninvestment program needs to be critically examined, as does the sector growth target. \nAppropriate interventions need to be identified to enable the Government to establish an \neffective policy approach to sector growth. \n200.  Moreover, it is apparent that the Government is looking for ways to stimulate the \nfisheries sector in order to meet its growth targets. However, inefficient investments and \ninappropriate  interventions  will  not  improve  the  sector\u2019s  performance  and  a  rigorous \nframework for promoting growth in an economically efficient and environmentally sustainable \nfashion is clearly needed. \n \nA.  Assessment of the Department of Fisheries\u2019 View \n201.  For this review a workshop was held with DOF officers to consider growth prospects \nfor key fisheries sectors. In addition information about the DOF\u2019s view on growth prospects \ncan be gleaned from its fishery development programs and its planned investment program \n(Appendix 7). \n \n202.  The  principal  fisheries  considered  to  have  growth  potential  (not  all  Government \nPolicy because some of the growth prospects were identified during the workshop) include: \n(i)  various aquaculture sectors such as black pearl, shrimp, seaweed and tilapia; \n \n(ii)  the small-scale tuna fishery; \n \n(iii)  the marine aquarium fishery;  \n \n(iv)  the deepwater snapper fishery; and \n \n(v)  the LRFF fishery. \n \n203.  The DOF is evaluating the option of investing up to F$150 million in developing a \nregional service centre to attract foreign vessels to use Fiji as a hub for maintenance and \nprovisioning of fishing vessels The CEO of MFF, Miti Baleivanualala, advised that unless \nthere is private sector interest Government will not be involved directly in development of a \nregional service cener. Development of outer island fisheries is also being promoted through \nthe establishment of RFSCs. (Again this has to be evaluated for economic viability and \ncontrasted with the alternative which is development of a mobile RFSC rather than fixed \ncenters).  \n \n204.  In addition, the DOF is also seeking to increase value-adding through its HACCP \ncompliance program which will improve access of loins and fillets into European markets. \nThe Forum Secretariat has also commissioned profiles of economic and technical feasibility \nfor 14 small-scale value-added activities including processing of fresh and frozen pelagic \nsteaks, smoked tilapia fillets, seaweed processing, and collection of marine natural products \nfor medical research. The key focus here is on the establishment of templates of protocols \nfor exports and quarantine and inspection which are the roles of DOF including training of \nindustry personnel.  \n \n1.  Regional Service Centre \n205.  In 2004 Walu Bay port in Suva received more than 300 visits from foreign fishing \nvessels and over 500 in the preceding year. In response MFF is evaluating the potential for \ndevelopment of a regional service centre. The cost of developing the Rokobili site in Walu ", "49 \nBay is estimated at between F$50 million and F$150 million, depending on the capacity and \nconfiguration of the development. Other sites may be also be considered as the options for \ndevelopment to avoid congestion in Suva Port (eg., Lami, Lautoka and Savusavu  -  ie., with \nthe completion of a new international airport.) \n \n206.  While it is beyond the scope of this study to conduct of full economic appraisal of the \nRSC  we  do  hold  a  number  of  reservations  about  the  viability  of  the  projects.  These \nreservations include the following:  \n \n(i)  the lack of scope for an increase in vessel visits. Industry analysts have \nobserved that only fresh fish longliners fishing in Solomon Islands, Vanuatu \nand  the  Fiji  Islands  and  wishing  to  air  freight  fresh  fish  are  likely  to \nconsistently select the Fiji Islands as a destination port. Other vessels (ie., \nvessels with super freezers) will elect to either transship at sea (although this \nis prohibited under the new Tuna Commission) or minimize costs by steaming \ndirect  to  Pago  Pago  or  Japan  for  offloading  rather  than  spend  around \nUS$720/per  container  on  ex-Suva  transshipments  (Pers.  Comm.  Russell \nDurham, business development manager, Fiji Fish); \n \n(ii)  the period of time and resources required to develop engineering expertise to \nservice foreign vessels. This is likely to be a major hurdle as it would create \nlags in the development of RSC business activity thus reducing the project \nreturns immensely; \n \n(iii)  the negative impact on demand of the new JICA funded jetty currently being \ndeveloped at Lami. If this facility\u2014which is to service local tuna boats, smaller \nsnapper fishers and other artisanal fisheries\u2014alleviates congestion at Walu \nBay then, clearly, benefits from developing the Rokobli site are lower; and \n \n(iv)  the economic cost on the domestic tuna fishery resulting from increased \ncompetition for air cargo space. If there is increased demand for air cargo \nspace this is likely to force up the freight charge, thus reducing profits for the \ndomestic fishery and reducing resource rent attached to the Fiji Islands\u2019 fish \nresource. In a more extreme scenario, if fish caught by the domestic fleet \ncannot be exported during periods of peak demand for air cargo space, then \nthe loss in the value of fishing the country\u2019s tuna resource would be even \ngreater.  \n \n207.  The pre-feasibility study of the Rokobili development recently undertaken for MFF52 \nshowed very high returns on investment. However, the study is seriously flawed because it \nincluded all expenditure as benefit items without attributing the relevant costs (eg., fuel sales \nand crew expenditure are counted as benefits but not the associated costs of supply). \nFurthermore, direct and indirect benefits were not clearly distinguished in the study. Cost \nbenefit analyses should be divided into two parts\u2014(i) an assessment of the rate of return on \ninvestment focusing solely on costs and benefits directly linked to the specific services \nprovided by the regional services centre; and (ii) an, as a secondary consideration, an \nassessment of the economic flow-on effects (eg. crew expenditure in the local economy).53 \n                                                 \n52 NETTS Planning & Infrastructure. 2004, Fiji International Fishing Port-pre-feasibility study, Report prepared for \nthe Ministry of Fisheries and Forests, December, Suva. \n53 Economic flow-ons, or indirect benefits should not be added to the direct benefits as they are measures of \neconomic activity and not measure economic gains attributable to an investment. The significance of indirect \nitems in cost benefit studies is poorly understood and often given too much weighting. The weight attached to \nindirect benefits should in fact be quite low because a large proportion, if not all, of such flow-ons would not be \nlost to the economy under an alternative investment scenario. Furthermore, if instead of investing in the RSC ", "50 \nThis  enables  the  economic  value  component  and  economic  activity  components  to  be \nseparately assessed which is extremely important when conducting cost benefit studies. \n \n208.  On balance it is considered that the likelihood of a RSC meeting core investment \ncriteria is extremely low, and the above discussion highlights the key concerns held about \nthe potential viability of the RSC and hence the dependence on subsidies. In addition, there \nare also concerns about negative social and environmental impacts that would need to be \ncomprehensively evaluated if the initiative is to be further examined. \n \n2.  Value Adding \n209.  There is some evidence that value-adding activity could increase, including: \n \n(i)  Solander (Pacific) LTD indicated that, despite higher labor costs than many \ncanneries, it had some initial success in supplying loins to countries in Europe \nand Asia. Solander overcame the labor cost problem, by focusing on the \nsupply of loins to canneries located in countries with high labor costs and high \nduty on canned fish, as the loins do not attract duty;    \n \n(ii)  large  supermarket  chains  in  Germany  and  other  EU  countries  have  also \nexpressed interest in purchasing large quantities of tuna steaks from the \nPacific region. However, the indication is that they would need guarantees of \nlarge  continuous  supplies  before  entering  into  long-term  purchasing \narrangements. To offset the effects of seasonality and other contributors to \nlow supply volumes, this would require coordination from countries within the \nregion (possibly Fiji, Vanuatu, and the Solomon Islands). Further investment \nin  processing  facilities  would  be  required  to  support  this  activity,  but  the \nGovernment\u2019s  role  should  only  be  in  the  form  of  coordinating  the  initial \nscoping of market opportunities and coordination activities; \n \n(iii)  there has been interest from hotels in increasing the use of locally-caught reef \nfish and tuna by-catch. The tourism industry has become one of the largest \nsectors of the economy in the Fiji Islands and there are indications that it will \ncontinue to grow. According to Ministry of Tourism officials, 70% to 80% of all \nfood served in the tourism industry is imported, and the relative amount of \nimported seafood is even greater.  The Fisheries Sector Specialist for this \nreview indicated that: \u201cIt seems that there is an opportunity to encourage the \nhotel industry to make use of the wide variety of domestic seafoods. Such \nencouragement should be in the form of awareness/facilitation rather than \nproduct  development,  involvement  in  commercial  marketing,  or  taxing \nimports\u2019\u2019. (However, the difficulty in increasing the amount of locally-caught \nfish  supplied  to  hotels  and  resorts  is  that  they  require  levels  of  supply \nreliability and quality that the domestic operators have not been able to meet); \nand \n \n(iv)  small-scale  valued-adding  activities  identified  in  the  14  \u201cprofile  studies\u201d \nrecently commissioned by the Forum Secretariat. Each of the profile studies \nshow  exceptionally  high  returns  on  investment.  However,  more  rigorous \nassessment  of  the  proposed  value-added  activities  is  needed  before  the \nGovernment invests in them. One of the concerns is that the profiles indicate \nextremely high levels of profitability that are unlikely to be reflective of the true \neconomic potential for the value-adding activities. This is usually symptomatic \n                                                                                                                                                     \nthe Government decided to lower taxes then this would induce economy-wide growth with associated flow-on \nbenefits. ", "51 \nof flawed modeling assumptions, and hence the assumptions should be re-\nexamined and more thoroughly tested. \n \n210.  In summary, while there may be some potential for increases in economic benefits \nfrom the sector through value-added activities, in many ways it would be premature to factor \nthese benefits into growth forecasts. Furthermore, we would caution against over-zealous \npromotion of value-added activities. The experience with PAFCO in the Fiji Islands and \nSolomon  Taiyo  in  the  Solomon  Islands  is  that  the  dependence  on  subsidies  of  fish \nprocessing companies effectively means that they can become a significant burden on the \neconomy.  \n \n3.  Aquaculture \n211.  An examination of the general advantages and disadvantages of aquaculture in the \nFiji Islands is contained in Pickering and Forbes54. The SPC Aquaculture Portal (website \nWWW.SPC.INT) has information on the constraints of aquaculture in the Fiji Islands.   \n \n212.  Specifically  with  respect  to  exports,  there  are  some  advantages/disadvantages \ncommon to all aquaculture exports, while some are applicable to only specific products. The \ngeneral advantages enjoyed by most aquaculture exports are:   \n \n(i)  the government is generally supportive of the aquaculture industry; and \n \n(ii)  good water quality. \n \n213.  The general disadvantages are: \n \n(i)  high production costs, including labor and feed; \n \n(ii)  high transport costs; and \n \n(iii)  periodic cyclones. \n \n214.  Some advantages/disadvantages of Fiji aquaculture products in international trade \nare specific to certain products and are relative to competing countries.  Commodities that \nare presently exported in significant quantities, or for which there is considerable export \nenthusiasm, include seaweed, black pearls, marine shrimp, and tilapia.  \n \n215.  Transport has been blamed for the poor performance of seaweed farming, but the \nlow farm-gate price of 50c/kg is the main cause of the problems. The current negotiated \nprice is barely adequate to cover labor and production costs and has resulted in a loss of \ninterest  and  frustration  among  farmers,  causing  them  to  venture  into  other  alternative \nsources of income.  However, in distant and remote islands, especially in the Southern Lau \nGroup, as in the case of Ono-i-Lau, seaweed is the only source of income available. Hence \nthere is some on-going production from these areas which appears less dependent on \ncontinued subsidization. The DOF\u2019s aquaculture specialist maintains that if dry seaweed \nproduction achieves 80 to 100 mt per month (dry weight), then the price will increase to \naround 75c/kg (as the international buyer can pass on some of the benefit from consistency \nof  supply).  The  DOF  also  has  plans  to  consult  with  Kiribati  and  other  Pacific  Islands \nproducing  countries  to  form  a  Regional  Cooperation  in  the  setting  up  of  a  seaweed \nprocessing factory, but it is generally accepted that seaweed companies have elected not to \ninvest in processing plant in the region due to poor economic viability compared with the \n                                                 \n54 Pickering, T. and A. Forbes 2002. The Progress of Aquaculture Development in Fiji. Technical Report 2002/1, \nMarine Studies Programme, University of the South Pacific. ", "52 \nPhilippines  and  Indonesia.  Overall,  the  experience  with  seaweed  has  been  quite  poor \ndespite high levels of subsidization and the indication is that the production level will only \nincrease if transport and marketing activities are subsidized. Hence we do not factor in \ngrowth of seaweed mariculture.  \n \n216.  On balance, we do not envisage any rapid growth in freshwater aquaculture simply \nbecause the evidence to date is that production is heavily reliant on Government subsidies. \nFor example, Tilapia has been more successful production wise, but is not yet economically \nviable in its own right. Hence, the DOF is getting a little ahead of itself in planning for rapid \ngrowth of the sector.  \n \n217.  There is, however, firm evidence that shrimp farming and black peal farming can be \neconomically viable. But given the risk factors involved, particularly for shrimp farming, which \nhas had large difficulties in building up production levels (due primarily to problems in \nbuilding up production of post larvae and reliance on expensive imported feed), we have \nonly factored in modest growth in these sectors in our sector growth forecasts (albeit large \npercentage increases as they are both at low current levels of production).  \n \n4.  Capture Fisheries  \n218.  There  is  some  potential  for  increases  in  profitability/resource  rent  from  capture \nfisheries, but, not surprisingly, limited scope for expansion and, in fact, contraction of fishing \neffort in some fisheries (Section 7.B.4 below) would enhance profitability. \n \n219.  The small scale-tuna fishery may experience a resurgence, as there were some 30 \nsmall scale tuna boats assisted into the fishery before the demise of the FAD program, but \nfollowing the failure to redeploy FADs the number of boats declined to just six. Some growth \nin this fishery is likely if the FAD program can be rejuvenated.  \n \n220.  The LRFF trade became active over the 1999-2002 period55 but while producing \ngood returns while fishing takes place\u2014fishers can earn between F$300 and F$700 per \nweek\u2014fishing cannot last long because the target species (ie., coral trout and coral cod) are \nvery slow growing. Hence the focus of the LRFF should be on sustainable management of \nthe resource rather than fishery development. The live reef fishery is intermittent and as the \nstock is slow growing the yield is low. It is therefore unlikely that this fishery will grow beyond \nthe current level (ie., around F$450,000 p.a.) \n \n221.  Industry specialists hold the view that the deepwater snapper fishery is marginal at \nbest due to low prices (the price has not moved from US$4/pound for the past 10 years). \nThis is the reason that the number of deepwater snapper boats has declined to the point \nwhere there are just one or two remaining in the fishery. Accordingly, there has been a rapid \nreduction in vessel numbers. For this reason we have not factored in any growth in the \nfishery, and would recommend that the DOF review its current policy of trying to re-build this \nfishery.  \n \n222.  Our assessment of the main competitors and factors affecting competitiveness for \neach of the key fisheries that the DOF is looking to for future growth are shown below (Table \n7.1). (Additional information on domestic markets for aquaculture, and reviews of relevant \neconomic feasibility studies are provided in Appendixes 8 and 9). \n \n                                                 \n55 Department of Fisheries, 2004, LRFF Overview Report, Report Complied by the LRFF Project Officer, \nNovember, Suva. ", "53 \nB.  Additional Impacts on Growth \n1.  Exploratory Fishing \n223.  Exploratory  fishing  in  the  offshore  fishery  could  lead  to  sector  growth.  Offshore \nlongline  operators  have  indicated  that  there  is  a  strong  likelihood  of  developing  an \neconomically viable swordfish fishery but exploratory fishing would be required to determine \nthe suitable fishing areas and to test catch rates. The cost of exploratory fishing is not \nmeasured  in  terms  of  the  vessel  operating  costs  alone,  but  also  includes  the  forgone \nrevenue from fishing the usual target species (tuna).  \n \n224.  Private operators cannot generally justify this type of activity due to the \u201cfree rider\u201d \nproblem (ie., other operators benefit from the activity) and, therefore, not all of the benefits \ncan be returned to the entity investing in the activity. Industry participants have also located \ndeepwater  stocks  on  depth  sounders\u2014exploratory  fishing  could  also  be  undertaken  to \ndetermine the species and whether there is a commercially viable fishery. This may require \ninvestment in more powerful depth sounders than currently used by industry. \n \n225.  Further work would be required to determine whether the Government should invest \nin exploratory fishing and, if so, how much it should invest. A workshop with specialists in \nthis area from SPC would be a suitable first step in further investigating the merit of funding \nexploratory fishing. \n \n ", "54 \nTable 7.1:  Assessment of Comparative Advantage for Aquaculture Commodities \n \nCommodity  Main Competitors  Advantage of Fiji Islands  Disadvantage of Fiji Islands \nSeaweed  Indonesia   Overseas buyers willing to offer forward supply/price  High labor costs. \nagreements. \nPhilippines  High transport costs to world market. \nLow opportunity costs of some communities. \nLess economy of scale. \nErratic transport to some growing areas. \nPresently driven by the public sector. \nLow labor productivity. \nCurrent farmgate price is below reserve wage for villagers \nBlack Pearls  French Polynesia  Low labor costs.

Price and Exchange Rate Impacts \n226.  The largest drivers of changes in the economic performance of the offshore longline \nfishery are (i) catch rates and (ii) tuna prices in, and exchange rates for, the US and Japan. \nThe price56 paid in Japan for imports of fresh bigeye from the Fiji Islands fell from F$16.75 in \n2001 to F$12.67 per kg in 2004 and over the same period the yellowfin price fell from \nF$15.90 per kg to F$11.93 per kg (FFA). 2004 prices were the lowest since 1997 (Figure 3). \nThis price reduction has been largely attributed to the 20% depreciation in the Yen against \nthe Fiji dollar over the 2001-2004 period.  \n \nFigure 3: Japanese Import Prices for Fresh Bigeye and Yellowfin, 1997-2004 \n \n20\n18\n16\nF) 14\nCI\ng (\nk\n$/ 12\nF\n10 Yellowfin\nBigeye\n8\n6\n1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004\n \n       Source: FFA \n \n227.  In addition, the US dollar has depreciated by some 25% against the Fiji dollar over \nthe past three years which has also contributed to reduced prices for exports to the US with \nthe fresh yellowfin price falling from F$7.13 per kg to F$5.76 per kg, the fresh bigeye price \nfrom F$6.97 kg to F$6.53 per kg and the fresh albacore price falling from F$6.82 kg to \nF$4.71 per kg. \n \n228.  Consequently, the value of catch exported to Japan and the US (75% of total fresh \nexports) has declined significantly. Coupled with declining catch rates and increase world oil \nprices, the price falls and exchange rate depreciations have contributed to financial difficulty \nfor many of the offshore longline operators.  \n \n \n3.  Crowding Out of the Private Sector \n229.  Generally, the DOF is not so much crowding out the private sector but, rather, \nbecoming  involved  in  uneconomic  activities  which  the  private  sector  does  not  appear \ninterested (eg., development of six tilapia markets, marketing of seaweed). The exception \nwould be fish marketing in some outer island areas already serviced by private markets \n                                                 \n56 All prices are inclusive of cost insurance and freight (CIF).  ", "56 \nwhich could be crowding out the private sector. While this has a detrimental effect on private \nsector operators in the affected areas, it is not highly relevant in terms of overall sector \ngrowth. As discussed in Section VI, however, if the DOF proceeded with plans to establish a \nNFC then crowding out issues would become prominent and damaging to the performance \nof the sector. \n \n230.  A  related  issue  is  distortions  to  the  operation  of  markets  created  by  inefficient \npolicies. Some of the aquaculture policies related to farm size, location and configuration \nrepresent decisions best made by the private sector and could reduce the potential for sector \ngrowth (Section III).  \n \n231.  It should also be noted that shrimp farmers maintain that the Government\u2019s shrimp \nhatchery  has  crowded  out  the  private  sector,  and  this  point  may  be  valid.  Further \nexamination of the costs and benefits of the Government\u2019s shrimp hatchery is required to \ndetermine whether it is appropriate to continue to fund the hatchery. MFF has acted on this \nissue, and has leased its shrimp hatchery to a private sector entity. (Details of the lease \narrangement were not known at the time of finalizing this report, and hence the effectiveness \nof these arrangements in overcoming the hatchery problems may need to be reviewed). \n \n4.  Increasing Efficiency of Fisheries \n232.  There are a number of ways in which the efficiency of Fiji Islands Fisheries can be \nimproved, with potential for substantial economic gains. Reform of the system for indigenous \nparticipation is likely to be associated with increased fishery efficiency, and could facilitate \ngrowth in key sectors such as pearl oyster farming. In the inshore and offshore longline \nfisheries increasing the efficiency and yield through improved management, and, in many \ncases, reduction in fishing effort is likely to significantly increase profitability and resource \nrent. For example, FFA/SPC57 recently estimated that resource rent could be increased by \nF$6 million to F$9 million p.a. through fleet rationalization.58 If, in addition, the efficiency of \ninshore fisheries could be increased by even 10% this would equate to F$2.8 million in \nbenefits each year.  Annual economic benefits, in terms of resource rent, from improved \nmanagement of Fiji Islands\u2019 fisheries could therefore be more than F$10 million. \n \n5.  Additional Marketing Activities \n233.  Both pearl oyster farmers and marine aquarium operators identified the need for \u201cbuy \nFiji\u201d marketing campaigns. This initiative would help support prices if supply increases, but \nshould be coordinated through peak industry bodies. The DOF could provide assistance \nthrough provision of secretariat support to assist in the development of active  industry \nassociations. \n \nC.  Impediments to Growth \n1.  Aquaculture \na.  Land and Water Tenure Issues \n234.  Generally, development of aquaculture is not hampered by the availability of suitable \nsites with the main criteria being the availability of clean water, natural flushing of the water \nsystems  (ie.,  in  brackishwater  and  mariculture  fish  farms),  and  natural  protection  from \n                                                 \n57 FFA/SPC. 2004. An Economic Analysis of the Fiji Longline Fishery, Report to the Fiji Islands Government, \nOctober, Honiara. \n58 Currently there is economic overfishing as there are more vessels in the offshore fishery than required to \nmaximize economic performance. This is in contrast to biological overfishing which is the scenario whereby the \nnumber of vessels, or level of fishing effort, exceeds that required to achieve maximum sustainable yield. ", "57 \ncyclones.59 However, land tenure issues remain a potential impediment given the nature of \nthe legislation regarding leases of native land (93% of the Fiji Islands land) and crown land \n(important as it relates to mangrove areas where brackishwater shrimp is farmed). \n \n235.  Maximum  lease  terms  are  set  down  under  The  Fiji  Land  Act  and  under  the \nAgricultural Land and Tenant Act. Currently, there are no formal water leases permitted (ie., \nareas below the high water mark). However, this is to change under proposed legislative \nreforms which would enable the securing of leases for a period of up to 15 years. However, \nthere are two remaining problems even following this reform. First, this period is too short to \noffer a sufficient time to earn a commercial rate of return on invested capital\u2014a period of 30 \nyears is required to ensure that benefit of future cash flows is fully taken into account by \ninvestors in making investment decisions. Second, for lease periods longer than 5 years, \napprovals will be required from the Great Council of Chiefs, representing an additional layer \nof approvals/administration for investors to go through. \n \n236.  Another issue that needs to be resolved is that native Fijians are unable to use land \nas collateral for obtaining finance. This could limit the start up of aquaculture businesses. \nThere is also a view that low lease payments provide insufficient incentive for Fijians to \nmobilize their land assets. This is an issue that could be examined in the proposed \u201cReview \nof Fisheries Taxation and Benefit Sharing\u201d.  \n \nb.  Exclusive Rights to Take Fish \n237.  A related issue that could impact growth of aquaculture is the establishment of \nproperty rights in the marine and coastal areas where aquaculture occurs. The aquaculture \nprovisions of the Fisheries Management Bill have been reviewed in an SPC publication \n(Evans et al., 2003). The comments are endorsed by the Fisheries Sector Review: \u201cThe \nproposed Fisheries Management Bill has improved the current arrangement by attempting to \nadequately define and distinguish aquaculture from capture fisheries. Although untested, it \nappears to be a relatively effective mechanism insofar as it will put in place a licensing \nscheme  specifically  for  aquaculture.  The  Bill,  however,  falls  short  of  comprehensively \naddressing the issue of property rights in the marine and coastal areas and the right to \nexclusively take fish in the farm area, which is needed to foster private sector development. \nHence, this may be an additional area of legislative reform that needs to be examined in the \nfuture. \n \nc.  Other Impediments \n238.  In respect of aquaculture the DOF has identified lack of infrastructure in rural areas \n(telecommunications, water supply, power), and lack of technical knowledge for hatchery \noperation, contributing to inability to establish a consistent supply of seedlings to farmers. \nFurther work is required to evaluate options for overcoming these problems, although the \nDOF is focusing its efforts on these issues. \n \n239.  Another potential impediment to growth is the financing of set-up cost for villages \nentering into partnerships with marine aquarium companies for the culture of live rock. A lack \nof a secure legal system means that there is no guarantee the villages will agree to sell the \nculture rock back to the company that invested in the initial infrastructure and supplied the \nmanufactured rock. This reduces incentives for companies to provide finance for this activity \nand the DOF, in conjunction with the FDB or other financial institutions, could look at ways of \novercoming this problem. \n \n                                                 \n59 However, potential damage from cyclones and flood events are two significant risk factors for the sector. ", "58 \n2.  The Cost of Doing Business in the Fiji Islands \n240.  The Government should seek to reduce the cost of doing business in the Fiji Islands, \nby adopting the strategies set out in the ADB\u2019s forthcoming study into impediments for \nprivate  sector  development  in  the  Fiji  Islands.60  This  study  identifies  the  following \ndeficiencies  in  the  structure  of  the  business  environment  in  the  Fiji  Islands:  political \nuncertainty, burdensome regulation, weak property rights, ineffective state involvement in \nthe economy, ineffective legal system for business, and poorly functioning finance markets. \nResolving property rights issues is particularly important in respect of the aquaculture fishery \nas operators are unlikely to invest if there is no protection over exclusive rights to harvest \nmature fish stocks.  \n \n241.  For this review, we conducted a survey of fishing industry operators with the focus \nmainly on processors and vertically integrated processing/fishing companies. The results of \nthe  survey  are  reported  in  Appendix  10.  Importantly,  the  issues  of  most  concern  to \ncompanies are: the tax on fuel and other inputs, excessive red tape in dealing with DOF and \nother Government agencies, and difficulty in finding skilled/productive staff. The results of \nthis survey are potentially extremely beneficial to the Government in examining ways to \nimprove sector performance and should be given due consideration by the Government. \n \n3.  Infrastructure Constraints \n242.  Compared to most Pacific Island Countries the Fiji Islands is quite well serviced in \nterms  of  infrastructure.  Nonetheless,  there  are  some  infrastructure  issues  that  warrant \nfurther examination. These include overcoming the problems of overcrowding at Walu Bay \nand  assessing  the  net  benefits  associated  with  regional  infrastructure  developments \nincluding the RFSCs.  \n \n243.  The Government should commission a study into the requirements for servicing \nvessels  using  the  Walu  Bay  port.  This  study  should  base  demand  forecasts  on  the \nproportion of vessels fishing in Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and the Fiji Islands that are \nexpected to choose Fiji Island\u2019s ports. (This is in contrast to the regional service centre \nconcept which anticipates that a new facility will be able to attract significant numbers of \nadditional fishing boats to Suva.) \n \n244.  There is also some consideration of developing a new port at Labasa. However, the \nDOF will need to apply stringent application of rigorous cost benefit techniques in respect of \nLabasa and all other large-scale infrastructure developments and to do so it will need to \nimprove  its  capability  in  the  field  of  economic  analysis  (this  is  required  even  when \noutsourcing economic studies). \n \n4.  Natural Impediments \n245.  It is important to recognize natural impediments to growth that Government policy \nand interventions cannot resolve\u2014at least not in a way that is beneficial to the economy. \nExamples of natural impediments include: \n \n(i)  Air cargo space. Leading fish processors based in the Fiji Islands maintain \nthat operation of charter flights has been examined in detail and found to be \nuneconomic. Moreover, processors have indicated that the reason that there \nis a fresh tuna industry in the Fiji Islands and not elsewhere in the Pacific (at \nleast not to the same extent) is because of the air cargo space available on \n                                                 \n60 The Enterprise Research Unit. 2004, Fiji Islands: A Private Sector Assessment \u2013 Promise Unfulfilled, Draft \nReport Prepared for the Asian Development Bank, September. ", "59 \nflights servicing the tourist market. A potential change that could increase air \ncargo space would be to reform regulations of air space to encourage more \nflights into the Fiji Islands. The FFA regional airfreight study, in contrast to the \nassessment of industry participants, noted that it may be possible to increase \nairfreight  capacity  by  using  dedicated  freighter  services  and  combined-\nservices (where freight is carried on the passenger deck). The FFA also noted \nthat carrying freight via Auckland and Sydney is a viable option when direct \nflights to the US and Japan have no spare capacity (and in fact this option is \nwidely used by industry). While it is beyond the scope of this study to explore \nthe  issue  of  air  cargo  capacity  in  more  detail,  it  may  be  appropriate  to \ncommission  further  research  on  this  issue  given  the  dependence  of  the \noffshore fishery and marine aquarium fishery on the availability of air cargo \nspace.  \n \n(ii)  Carrying capacity of the resource. There are a number of cases documented \nin this report where the Government has pursued fishery development in the \nabsence of due concern for the productivity of the resource. Pushing a fishery \nbeyond its natural limits will lead to a lowering of resource rent (ie., value of \nthe resource) with potential for serious economic losses. \n \n(iii)  Cost structure for competing countries. If other countries have a comparative \nadvantage in production then the Fiji Islands may not be able to compete in a \nparticular industry. Providing subsidizes and tax breaks and other assistance \ncan  lead  to  short-term  increases  in  exports.  However,  these  strategies \ngenerate a net cost on the economy and, therefore, are difficult to justify.  \n \nD.  Growth Projections \n246.  In essence there are three key drivers of sector growth. The first is the price of tuna \n(driven by demand in US and Japan and the strength of the US dollar and Japanese Yen). \nCurrent prices for fresh fish are between 6% and 44% lower than in 2001. Recognizing that \nfresh fish exports make up 37% of export volumes and 55% of total ex-vessel revenues, it \nconsidered reasonable to include in an upper-bound projection an overall 10% increase in \nprices for offshore catch, and a 5% increase under a base-case scenario. The second key \ngrowth driver is the degree of success of the DOF in improving the efficiency of offshore and \ninshore fisheries we factor in growth projections consistent with the estimates provided in \nSection  7.B.4.  The  third  key  growth  driver  is  the  expected  growth  in  marine  aquarium \nexports. Currently exports of marine aquarium are valued at F$14 million p.a. and this could \ndouble within 10 years under a base-case scenario. An upper-bound scenario would see \nmarine aquarium exports increasing to three times the current level\u2014ie., F$42 million p.a.61 \nHence,  the  marine  aquarium  fishery\u2014which  requires  relatively  little  input  from  the \nGovernment, other than establishing sound management regimes, represents possibly the \nbest growth prospect in the Fiji Islands.  \n \n247.  Other second-tier potential contributors to growth (or efficiency improvement) include \nintroduction of the HACCP and European Union compliant food handling systems, as this \nwill provide greater access to European markets. Addressing problems of overcrowding at \nWalu Bay will improve the efficiency of the offshore fleet which may provide some economic \nbenefits. These benefits, however, are difficult to quantify given the available information and \nhigh levels of uncertainty.  In addition, at this stage there is too much uncertainty over the \n                                                 \n61 Industry sources have indicated that production could increase by between three and five times the existing \nlevels in the medium term. However, these projections have been moderated to account for uncertainty, the \nimpacts of management regime which may place restrictions over exploitation levels, and price effects. ", "60 \npotential benefits from new value-added activities and exploratory fishing to factor them into \nforecasts even under an upper-bound scenario. \n \n248.  From the discussion above, we would also expect at least some growth in pearl \noyster farming and shrimp farming. The current pearl oyster production is in the order of F$2 \nmillion (for 2004), the upper-bound scenario incorporates a three-fold increase in production, \nand a base-case scenario incorporates a 50% increase. Under the upper-bound scenario \nshrimp  production  increases  to  10  mt  valued  at  F$300,000  and  under  the  base-case \nscenario it recovers to its previous record level of 6 mt each year valued at F$180,000.  \n \nTable 7.2: Indicative Projections of Medium-Term Fisheries Sector Growth \n(F$ millions) \n \nCategory  Base-case    Upper-bound    Lower-bound \n  Revenue  Value-   Revenue  Value-   Revenue  Value-\neffects  added  effects  added  effects  added \nOffshore longline \u2013  2.5  2.5    5  5    0  0 \nprice effects \nOffshore longline \u2013  na  4.5    na  9    na  0 \nefficiency \nimprovements \nInshore fisheries \u2013  na  1.5    na  3    na  0 \nefficiency \nimprovements \nMarine Aquarium -  14  2.8    28  5.6    0  0 \nexpansion \nPearl oyster \u2013  1  0.45    4  1.8    0  0 \nexpansion \nShrimp -  0.2  0.09    0.3  0.2    0  0 \nexpansion \nTotal Increase  17.7  11.8    37.3  24.6    0  0 \n% Increase over  9.3%  12.9%    19.6%  26.8%    0%  0% \ncurrent levels of \nsector output \n \n \n249.  Overall, under an upper bound scenario the above forecasts indicate there could be \nan increase in fisheries revenue of some F$37 million (20% increase over current revenue) \nand an increase in contribution to GDP (value-added) of F$25 million (27% increase). Under \na base-case scenario revenue is projected to increase by F$32 million and contribution to \nGDP by F$14.6 million. These projections are based on a very high level assessment of \nfuture potential for Fiji Islands\u2019 fisheries and a high degree of uncertainty is attached to these \nforecasts. These caveats should be noted in any reference to these forecasts. \n ", "61 \nE.  Recommendations \nRecommendation  25.  A  number  of  recommendations  flow  from  the  above  assessment  of \ngrowth potential for the sector. These recommendations are as follows: \n \n(i)  The  Government  should  seek  to  increase  efficiency  of  the  offshore  fishery  by \ncommissioning further research into the economic performance of the fishery, and taking \nthe research results into account in establishing the license cap.  \n \n(ii)  The Government should accelerate the process of introducing management plans for \ninshore fisheries as this will also increase economic benefits from these fisheries. \n \n(iii)  The Government should actively seek to lower the cost of doing business in the Fiji \nIslands. This will require vigorously pursuing reform to address the following structural \nproblems:  political  uncertainty,  weak  property  rights,  costly  telecommunications, \ninefficient taxes, burdensome regulation, an ineffective legal system for business, and \npoorly functioning finance markets. \n \n(iii)  Rigorous economic, social and environmental evaluation studies are required of the RSC \noption, if the Government is to continue to pursue this option. \n \n(iv)  The Government needs to consider options for addressing overcrowding problems at \nWalu Bay dock and berthing facility. \n \n(vi)  Reforms are required to improve land and marine tenure as this will affect incentives to \ninvest in aquaculture and marine aquarium fisheries (ie., culture of live rock in qoliqoli). \nIssues to examine include introduction of legislation to support water leases, increasing \nmaximum  lease  terms  to  30  years  (for  land  and  water  leases)  and  overcoming \ninefficiencies within the Native Fisheries Commission (within NLTB). \n \n(vi)  To secure growth in the marine aquarium fishery the Government should consider further \nconsolidation of the existing management structure, and further encourage operators to \ndevelop management plans for their collection areas.  \n \n(vii)  Another measure which could promote growth in the marine aquarium fishery is financing \nset-up costs for villages entering into partnerships with marine aquarium companies for \nthe culture of live rock. A lack of a secure legal system to enforce contracts reduces \nincentives for companies to provide this finance. \n \n \nVIII.  CONCLUDING COMMENTS \n250.  In many ways a fresh start is needed to revitalize the operations of the DOF. There \nare many areas where reform is urgently needed and it is imperative that the Fiji Islands \nGovernment actively pursues establishment of a comprehensive capacity building program \nto activate the reform process.  \n \n251.  While this review is designed to critique and challenge the existing policies and \ninstitutional framework, it must be recognized that there are many capable staff within the \nDOF who are eager to increase the effectiveness of fisheries management. It must also be \nrecognized  that  great  progress  has  been  made  in  a  number  of  key  areas  such  as \nmanagement of the offshore fishery and initiating the qoliqoli surveying/management plan \ndevelopment  process  under  the  FLMMA/Fisheries  partnership.  Establishing  a  robust \nstructure  for  management  of  the  marine  aquarium  fishery  has  been  another  important \nachievement (although further progress needs to be made to fully utilize this framework). ", "62 \nWhat is lacking, however, is the real impetus to challenge the existing way of going about \nfisheries management and to modernize the operations of the DOF.  \n \n252.  The key to future success of the sector is to harness the capacities within the DOF, \nand embark upon the recommended reform program. To assist in this regard we have \ndeveloped a roadmap for reform which outlines the appropriate sequencing of reforms and \nimportant milestones (Appendix 1). This roadmap represents one way of achieving the \nreform objectives. The Government may elect to adapt the roadmap for various reasons, but \nit should seek to maintain the integrity of the reform process that is encompassed within the \nroadmap we have presented. It must be stressed that a systematic and disciplined approach \nto the reform process is essential if Fiji is to move strongly in the direction of best practice in \nrespect of fisheries management.

With assistance from the FFA, a Fisheries Management Bill was drafted in 2002. The \nBill  was  discussed  with  various  stakeholders  at  a  meeting  in  September  2002  and \nrecommendations for modifying the Bill were made.  According to officials of the Office of the \nSolicitor General, the Bill has not yet been presented to Cabinet. Procedurally, the Office of \nthe Solicitor General does not begin its work on a Bill until it has received Cabinet approval. \nThe Fisheries Management Bill appears to have been with the Ministry of Fisheries and \nForests for quite some time awaiting action.  Discussion with Ministry officials suggest that at \nleast some senior fisheries officers are uncomfortable with the new Bill and would prefer \namendments to the present Fisheries Act, rather than a new Act.  \n \n2.  The principal reasons for supporting the new Fisheries Management Bill are as \nfollows: \n \n(i)  The present Fisheries Act dates from 1942 and, according to Adams (1993), it \narose out of ordinances put in place in the 1890s with additions over the \nyears.  Quite simply, the Fisheries Act is outdated.  The Marine Spaces Act is \n25 years old and since that time the Law of the Sea Convention (which is its \nprimary underpinning) has been advanced by the UN Fish Stocks Agreement, \nthe FAO Code of Conduct, and other international legal instruments.  Many of \nthese set new benchmarks for the way fisheries should be managed, and Fiji \nis a party to all of these arrangements.  \n \n(ii)  The present Fisheries Act is confined to the \u201cregulation of fishing\u201d and the \nconservation/management of fish stocks.  Post-harvest aspects of fisheries, \nincluding quality control, are not covered by the Act. Similarly, the regulation \nof exports is not covered by the Act, but such regulation is presently carried \nout by the DOF without a legal basis. (However a new Food Safety Bill has \nbeen proposed that would provide this authority). \n \n(iii)  The Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Convention, to which Fiji is a \nsignatory, makes demands on Fiji that must be reflected in the fisheries \nlegislation. These include legal provisions for high seas fishing, port state \ncontrols, flag state controls, and implementing WCPFC regulations.  \n \n(iv)  The Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Convention, to which Fiji is a \nsignatory, makes demands on Fiji that must be reflected in the fisheries \nlegislation. These include legal provisions for high seas fishing, port state \ncontrols, flag state controls, and implementing WCPFC regulations.  \n \n(v)  The establishment of the National Fisheries Authority is a major feature of the \nFisheries Management Bill. The bold move in establishing the NFA could \nassist in mitigating many of the chronic problems that plague the DOF and \nshould be supported.  \n \n(vi)  Other legislative events are over-taking the development of the Fisheries \nManagement Bill. The Customary Fisheries Bill is likely to be enacted in mid-\n2005.  If enacted in the current form, it would have a major impact on the \npresent  Fisheries  Act  (repealing  sections  13  to  20)  and  the  DOF\u2014a \nCustomary  Fisheries  Commission  is  to  be  established  that  will  be \n                                                 \n62 This Appendix is an extract from: Gillette, R. 2005. Aspects of Fisheries Management, Legislation, Research, \nDevelopment, Extension and Aquaculture in Fiji, Report of the Fisheries Specialist ADB Fisheries Sector \nReview, January. ", "  Appendix 6  75 \n \n\u201cresponsible for the control and administration of the commercial use and \nexploitation  of  all  customary  fisheries  resources  within  customary  fishing \nareas\u201d.  According  to  officials  of  the  Environment  Department,  the \nEnvironment Management Bill is likely to be enacted in 2005. If enacted in the \npresent form, it would have a major impact on the activities of the DOF. The \nBill establishes requirements for environmental impact assessments for 26 \ntypes  of  developments,  (including  several  that  would  affect  fisheries \ndevelopments) and empowers the Environment Department to formulate a \nNational Resource Management Plan. \n \n3.  Many features in the above two Bills are positive and should be supported. However \nseveral questions arise as to institutional jurisdiction \u2013 for example, is the board established \nunder the Customary Fisheries Bill the best entity to manage Fiji\u2019s commercial inshore \nfisheries?  If  the  Ministry  does  not  focus  a  substantial  amount  of  attention  on  fisheries \nlegislation in the very near future, there is some possibility that any eventual change in \nfisheries legislation will have to fit into gaps left over from new customary fisheries and \nenvironment legislation.    \n \n4.  Although  the  Fisheries  Management  Bill  should  be  supported,  a  number  of \nmodifications to the present version should be considered. \n \n5.  The Bill establishes a National Fisheries Authority. The major feature of the Authority \nis that it is not controlled by a single public servant, but rather by a board made up of a \nvariety  of  stakeholders,  including  representatives  of  the  tuna  industry,  inshore  fishers, \nrelevant Ministries and the NGO community. As the Authority is responsible to the Board, the \nwork of the Authority will become more aligned to wishes of the members of the board, \ninstead of the often adversarial relationship that exists now between the staff of the DOF and \nfishery stakeholders63. This change will promote greater relevancy of the work program, \nincreased  transparency,  and  a  higher  degree  of  accountability  \u2013  features  that  are \ndesperately needed at present.  Although the transition to an NFA-type arrangement would \nrepresent a major step for the government, such bold action is required to address the main \nproblems associated with the DOF.  The move to an Authority should certainly be supported, \nbut in a form somewhat different than that proposed in the Fisheries Management Bill. As \npresently  formulated,  the  scope  of  the  Authority  is  limited  to  the  management  of  tuna \nfisheries. The NFA\u2019s responsibilities should be expanded to encompass the management of \nall fisheries (inshore/offshore) in Fiji. \n \n6.  Other modifications to the Bill that should be considered are: \n \n(vii)  The major commercial fisheries (inshore and offshore) should be managed by \nthe use of management plans (Section III). Doing so could address many of \nthe weaknesses in fishery management in Fiji. Although the present version \nof the Bill recognizes the value of such plans, the requirement to formulate \nplans is at the discretion of the Minister. Experience from other countries \nindicates that, in the absence of a firm legal requirement, the very desirable \nscheme of fisheries management being guided by plans often does not get \nimplemented.  The Bill should specifically state that fisheries management \nplans  are  compulsory  for  all  major  commercial  fisheries  in  Fiji  and there \nshould be mechanisms to assure adherence to the plans.   \n \n(viii)  The  aquaculture  provisions  of  the  Bill  have  been  reviewed  in  an  SPC \npublication (Evans et al., 2003). The comments are endorsed by the Fisheries \n                                                 \n63 As an example, with a representative of small-scale fishers on the NFA board, the FAD programme probably \nwould not have come to a halt as was the case in 2004. ", "76  Appendix 6 \nSector Review: \u201cThe proposed Fisheries Management Bill has improved the \ncurrent  arrangement  by  attempting  to  adequately  define  and  distinguish \naquaculture from capture fisheries. Although untested, it appears to be a \nrelatively  effective  mechanism  insofar  as  it  will  put  in  place  a  licensing \nscheme  specifically  for  aquaculture.  The  Bill,  however,  falls  short  of \ncomprehensively addressing the issue of property rights in the marine and \ncoastal areas and the right to exclusively take fish in the farm area, which is \nneeded to foster private sector development.\u201d \n \n(ix)  As mentioned above, one of the weak provisions of the present Fisheries Act \nis that all fishing licenses expire on December 31 of each year. This results in \na licensing period that is too short. The present form of the Bill states that a \nlicense \u201cremains in force, until the day on which it expires in accordance with \nthe period approved by the Board from time to time for the class of license to \nwhich  it  belongs\u201d.    Although  the  flexibility  given  to  the  board  on  license \nperiods is desirable, the bill should specifically state that the license period \nshould be established taking into consideration investment/credit issues.  \n \n(x)  The inshore fisheries management provisions in the Bill must be reconciled \nwith those in the Customary Fisheries Act and the Environment Management \nAct, bearing in mind the management expertise in the various agencies.  \n \n(xi)  Regardless  of  which  agency  undertakes  inshore  fisheries  management \nduties, attention needs to be focused on the issue of how local bans in \ncustomary fishing areas can be nationally recognized.  \n \n7.  Fish wardens are a major feature of the Fisheries Act, but receive only very small \nmention in the new Bill: \u201cThe Minister shall by notice published in the gazette, appoint a \nDirector of Fisheries and such other fisheries officers and fish wardens\u201d. There needs to be a \nprovision in the bill to allow for regulations covering fish wardens and addressing the present \ndifficulties (compensation, up-to-date list of wardens, duties, obligations, de-commissioning).   \n ", "  Appendix 12  77 \n \nAPPENDIX 7:   FIJI GOVERNMENT\u2019S FISHERIES INVESTMENT PROGRAM, 2004-06 \n(F$ millions) \n \nCategory  Total \nNational Fisheries Authority  4.0 \nFisheries Training Centre  2.85 \nNational Fisheries Corporation  3.0 \nRural Fisheries Service Centres  7.0 \nNational Inshore Fisheries Resource Inventory  1.75 \nPearl Oyster Project  2.8 \nShrimp Project  3.15 \nFresh Water Aquaculture  3.3 \nReef Reseeding and Inshore Resource Assessment  3.8 \nAquarium Project  4.2 \nInstitutional strengthening of the Fisheries Department  0.5 \nProduct Development & Utilization  5.0 \nInternational Fishing Service Terminal  150.0 \nLive Food Fish Project  4.0 \nSeaweed Development  2.0 \nRiver Weed Control and Resource Enhancement  2.0 \nFishing Industry and Aquaculture Legislation  0.35 \nFisheries Management Information Systems  0.7 \nFisheries Research/Training Vessels  1.75 \nBusiness Development and Marketing Research  2.0 \nFisheries Research Centre  7.5 \nInshore Fisheries Legislation Development & Management Plan  3.5 \nMarine Protected Area  2.5 \nLami Fishing Port  25.0 \nLabasa Fishing Port  16.0 \nTOTAL  258.7 \n*  To be revised in 2006. \n     Source: Ministry of Fisheries and Forests Strategic Development Plan 2004-2006. \n ", "78  Appendix 8 \nAPPENDIX 8:   NOTES ON THE ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY OF AQUACULTURE IN FIJI \n \n1.  Limited research has been undertaken on the economic feasibility of aquaculture \nactivities in Fiji. The available information to the Fisheries Sector Review included: \n \n(i)  Some financial information was provided to the Fisheries Sector Review by a \npearl farmer and by a shrimp farmer. Both sets of information show high \npotential rates of return on investment (assuming no disease problems, and \nno problems in production of post larvae and spat). \n \n(ii)  Some feasibility analysis for tilapia export was done in Costa-Pierce (1997). \nHe concluded that shipping and feed costs were too expensive to make \nmoney on a scheme to export tilapia to markets in the mainland US. \n \n(iii)  Luxton (2002) commented on viability of the seaweed farming in the Lau \nIslands. He stated that viability is no longer dependent on identifying suitable \nsites but rather on the way that development and the business of trading are \nmanaged. \n \n(iv)  The  economics  of  tilapia  production  are  explored  in  Nandlal  (1997).  He \nconcluded that the internal rate of return of ten 1,000 sq m backyard tilapia \nponds was 40.9%. \n \n(v)  The report of a workshop on the economics of aquaculture in Fiji (Johnstone \nand Pickering, 2003) contains some analysis. The results are given in Table \nA8.1. \n \nTable A8.1  The Results of a Workshop on the Economics of Aquaculture in Fiji64\n \n  Farm Area   Annual   Cost  Margin  Rate of  \n(hectares)  Yield  (F$)  (F$)  Return \n(metric tons)  (%) \nTilapia  1.0  26.3/ha 2,490/mt 39,785  41.4 \nFreshwater prawns  0.45  3.5/ha 11,130/mt 6,100  32.3 \nShrimp  7.0  2.9/ha 13,950/ha 27,052  16.5 \nSeaweed (commercial)  510 km of line  2.5/km 640/mt 300,717  78.0 \nSeaweed (semi- 12 km of line  4.0/km 490/mt 296  10.8 \ncommercial) \n \n2.  In examining the general subject of aquaculture feasibility in Fiji, some features \nbecome apparent: \n \n(i)  Some of the work on economic feasibility could have benefited from a scrutiny \nof the methodology used. For example, at least some of the studies ignore \nthe opportunity costs of labor. \n \n(ii)  The high rate of return for seaweed is inconsistent with the level of private \nsector interest shown in buying and selling seaweed, and even the DOF \ninformation  about  the  sector  (ie.,  low  interest  in  seaweed  farming  from \nvillages in outer islands due to payments being too low despite assistance to \nalmost 400 individuals in the purchase of punts and outboards) \n                                                 \n64 These results are as listed in the report of the workshop.  It is not known whether they were produced using \nrigorous data or if they are merely hypothetical examples. ", "  Appendix 8  79 \n \n \n(iii)  Similarly, questions should be asked as to why, with the 300+ tilapia farmers \nand extensive subsidies there is low level of commercial tilapia markets. Do \nthese farmers really have no knowledge of the returns available from selling \ntilapia at markets?   \n \n3.  Considering  the  large  investment  in  aquaculture  in  the  country,  the  paucity  of \nrigorous feasibility studies is surprising. As with the marketing studies above, some of the \nfeasibility  efforts  could be  considered  \u201caquaculture  promotion\u201d,  rather  than  an  objective \nexamination of feasibility.  The process of determining feasibility of an aquaculture activity \nshould be distanced from the zeal to obtain funds for development of that activity. \n \n(i)  Another general aspect of aquaculture feasibility in Fiji concerns minimum \nfarm sizes to achieve viability. There is the sentiment in the aquaculture \nindustry and regional/international aquaculture advisors that, for some of the \ncommercially-oriented types of aquaculture, economies of scale are required \nto achieve profitability. This has been expressed in a variety of ways: \n \n(ii)  A large pearl farmer in Fiji has stated that a farm needs to implant 50,000 \npearl oysters each year to be viable. \n \n(iii)  A  tour  of  Fiji  aquaculture  facilities  in  mid-2004  by  notable  aquaculture \nspecialists from regional and international institutions (SPC 2004) concluded: \n\u201cit was probably not financially viable for small pearl farms to operate.\u201d \n \n(iv)  The  SPC/ACIAR  Black  Pearl  Culture  Workshop  in  Kiribati  carried  out \neconomic modeling and concluded \u201ca small private sector (5,000 oysters) \nintegrated operation, culturing round pearls is relatively high risk. \n \n(v)  Experience in French Polynesia suggests that the small pearl farms are non-\nviable. \n \n(vi)  In  dealing  with  another  aquaculture  commodity,  marine  shrimps,  an \nestablished farmer in Fiji states that a minimum farm size of 10 to 12 hectares \nis required for viability. \n \n4.  Considering  this  experience,  the  DOF  should  reconsider  its  stated  intentions  of \nencouraging small pearl farms as stated in the 10 year development plan, and promoting \nsmall marine shrimp farms as indicated by some fisheries officers.  \n \n5.  The above observations reinforce the need for objective economic feasibility studies. \nOtherwise, there is the possibility that an ironic situation could result\u2014the DOF could be \nencouraging non-economic activities and promoting small marine shrimp farms as indicated \nby some fisheries officers. \n \nViews on Potential for Aquaculture in Fiji \n \nVillaluz (1972): \u201cOf all the Pacific Islands Fiji has the greatest potential for Aquaculture\u201d \n \nSPC (1970): \u201cFish culture is a very promising industry in Fiji\u201d \n \nMAF (1978): \u201cFive and a half years of development work towards fish farming on mangrove \nreclamations at the Raviravi Fish Farm has been completed and the project is to be taken to \nthe commercial phase by a private company in joint venture with the National Marketing \nAuthority in March 1978\u201d ", "80  Appendix 8 \n \nMAFF  (1981):  \u201cA  number  of  projects  involving  the  propagation  and/or  growing-on  of \nfreshwater  and  marine  organisms  have  been  identified  as  being  probably  suitable  to \nconditions in Fiji\u201d.  \nKunatuba (1993): \u201cThe future looks bright for aquaculture in Fiji\u201d.  \nRichards (1994): \u201cThe Rural Aquaculture Programme shows great promise\u201d \n \nMAFF (1996): \u201cThe government is trying to promote aquaculture and expectations for a \nmajor breakthrough is anticipated in the not too distant future\u201d. \n \nNandlal (1997): \u201cFish farming has the potential to provide high quality protein to rural Fiji \nand to generate significant income within a short period of time relative to other crops\u201d \nFisheries Division Annual Report 1998: \u201cThe commercial development of aquaculture and \nmariculture  commodities  are  still  in  the  infancy  stages.

(2003): \u201cwith the range of additional projects and the government\u2019s research \nfocus  on  diversification  into  additional  species,  aquaculture  production  is  expected  to \nincrease dramatically\u201d \n \n6.  With regard to the success of aquaculture in Fiji, the results have been mixed:  \n \n(i)  Tilapia  has  been  cited  as  a  success.  Indeed  the  number  of  farms  and \nassociated production have increased considerably in recent years. A USP \nreport (Pickering and Forbes, 2002) states that tilapia farming was the first \nform  of  aquaculture  in  Fiji  to  make  the  leap  from  technical  success  to \neconomic success and really take root in Fiji\u2019s private sector. It should be \nnoted, however, that the small-scale inland tilapia farms have been, and \nremain, heavily subsidized by the government - from the provision of fry to \ntransporting the adult fish to market.   \n \n(ii)  At least one of the large-scale pearl oyster farms seems to be entering a \nprofitable phase. \n \n(iii)  The  culture  of  most  of  the  items  listed  in  Table  A8.1  above  has  been \ndiscontinued and cannot be considered a success. \n \n(iv)  With  the  possible  exception  of  some  freshwater  prawn  farming,  other \nexamples of sustained success in private sector aquaculture in Fiji are more \ndifficult to identify. \n \n7.  The above comments on the success of aquaculture in Fiji are consistent with that of \na  recent  review  of  aquaculture  in  the  country:  \u201cDespite  attempts  over  three  decades, \naquaculture remains poorly developed\u201d 65(USP and Fiji Institute of Technology, 2004). \n \n                                                 \n65 USP Marine Studies Programme and School of Maritime Studies, Fiji Institute of Technology. 2004.

From the above information it can be concluded that there has been considerable \naquaculture work in Fiji (marine, brackishwater, freshwater) stretching over a long period and \ncovering large variety of species. Additionally, the Fiji Government and donors have made a \nsubstantial  investment  in  aquaculture,  and  there  is  much  enthusiasm  for  the  future  of \naquaculture  in  the  country.    The  reality  is,  however,  that  aquaculture  remains  poorly \ndeveloped in Fiji.  This carries some suggestion that either: \n \n(v)  The potential and opportunities provided by aquaculture in the country have \nbeen over-estimated; or  \n \n(vi)  Past aquaculture development work has been inappropriate; or \n \n(vii)  There are governance issues that negatively affect aquaculture; or \n \n(viii)  There is still need to remove impediments to growth (see Section VII)   \n \n ", "82  Appendix 9 \nAPPENDIX 9:  DOMESTIC MARKETS FOR AQUACULTURE PRODUCTS \n \n1.  The information available to the Fisheries Sector Review on domestic markets for Fiji \naquaculture products was limited to: \n \n(i)  the Tilapia Industry Production and Marketing Study (Costa-Pierce, 1997); \n \n(ii)  observations and notions in the various reviews of aquaculture in Fiji; \n \n(iii)  opinions of fisheries officers and aquaculture industry participants; \n \n(iv)  Customs Department import statistics; \n \n(v)  2004 Census of Fiji freshwater aquaculture industry; \n \n(vi)  views of seafood retailers; and \n \n(vii)  data on existing commodity production  \n \n2.  Domestic marketing information from these sources has been used to construct \nTable A9.1. \n \nTable A9.1: Domestic Marketing Information on the Main Aquaculture Products \n \nCommodity  Information on Domestic Markets  Comment \nTilapia* \nCosta-Pierce  (1997)  using  the  \u201creplacement  series\u201d  concept,  The tilapia study did not take \nestimated that the market demand on Viti Levu was 66 to 324 mt per  into consideration the effect that \nyear.  low cost by-catch from tuna \nlonglining (2,000 mt in 2003) \nThe 2004 census of Fiji freshwater aquaculture industry stated that \nwould have on demand for \n\u201c30 mt of tilapia valued at F$125 thousand were produced\u201d. \ntilapia; \nBillings (2004) estimates 2003 tilapia production was 123 mt valued \nThe tilapia study assumed the \nat F$610,000. \nsame demand for tilapia as for \nAn important Suva fish retailer (Cakaudrove Fish) indicates that (a)  \u201creef fish and mullet\u201d \ndemand for tilapia drops off when the price rises above F$3.50/kg, (b) \n \nlow budget consumers generally prefer the cheaper tuna by-catch, (c) \nhigh budget consumers generally prefer fish such as snapper; \nExtrapolating from just information received from a single live tilapia \nretailer in the Nausori market, it appears about 13 mt of tilapia passes \nthrough that market annually.

Using the above and other information from the Fisheries Sector Study, the following \nobservations can be made on the domestic markets for aquaculture products:  \n \n(i)  For tilapia, the market has changed considerably in the seven years since the \nstudy,  especially  concerning  the  competing  tuna  by-catch.  The  projected \nproduction of tilapia (2,000 mt in the Freshwater Aquaculture Sector Plan for \n2006) seems large relative to the present production and size of the tilapia \nmarket estimated in Costa-Pierce (1997). \n \n(ii)  For shrimp, the way in which the size of the local market is calculated is not \nreadily apparent and appears much larger than present consumption.  \n \n4.  Some of the estimates of market size that have been done (by both government staff \nand aquaculture industry participants) could be considered \u201caquaculture promotion\u201d, rather \nthan an objective examination of markets. It is suggested that future marketing studies \n(especially those used for policy decisions) be carried out by individuals who are detached \nfrom the results. \n \n5.  There have been few detailed marketing studies for Fiji aquaculture products. It is \nlikely that if such studies were to be carried out, some myths would be dispelled and \nopportunities could be identified.   \n \n ", "84  Appendix 10 \nAPPENDIX 10:  Survey of Commercial Fishing Operators \n \n1.  A survey of Fiji Fishing businesses was undertaken for the review to determine first \nhand the problems that operators found most detrimental to profits and growth potential. \nSurvey participants were asked to rank impediments from 1 to 10 (with a rank of 1 indicating \nthe  greatest  negative  impact  on  profits  and  growth).  The  results  of  the  survey  were \nextremely revealing and should be closely evaluated by the Government. \nA10.1).  \n \nTable A10.1:  Results of industry participant survey to identify growth impediments & \nnegative impacts on profits \n \nCategory  Average  %  Overall \nrating  ranked 1  rating \n(rating of 1  or 2  (1=worst) \nto 10; \n1=worst) \nHigh fuel taxes/taxes on other inputs  3  69  1 \nLong waiting times for loading/offloading  5  0  7 \nat port \nLimited air cargo space  5  13  5 \nLand transport problems (ie.

High fuel taxes and taxes on other inputs was easily the most significant negative \nimpact for operators, which points to the importance of tax reform in Fiji. The second most \nsignificant problem was the difficulty in finding skilled/productive staff, indicating that training \nis a priority need. Ranked third in terms of negative impact was unnecessary red tape in \ndealing with Fisheries and other government agencies.66 Time taken to offload at port was \nnot as important as may have been expected, nor were problems related to land tenure. \nHowever, it is important to stress that uncertainty related to customary tenure of marine \nareas was a major concern for game and charter boat operators, with one respondent noting \nthat this was \u201chindering expansion plans at present\u201d. During the course of the review we \nreceived similar comments from aquaculture operators.  \n \n3.  Respondents were given the opportunity to note other \u201cadditional\u201d impediments to \ngrowth and noted the following: \n \n                                                 \n66 MFF responded to this criticism by noting that this problem prevails as the Department Officers want control \nrather than facilitating, and this is reflected in: (i) the lack of published procedures about export protocols; (ii) \n\u201cold fashioned\u201d permit issues per shipment (even though they deal with the same exporters); and (iii) shifting \ndemands due to no written guidelines. Online services, which are currently being set up, would address many \nof these shortcomings. ", "  Appendix 10  85 \n \n(i)  the high cost of electricity and fuel, with one respondent noting that the Lami \nIndustrial estate has power supply problems; \n \n(ii)  delays from government agencies in providing start up approvals and work \npermits, especially the Fiji Trade and Investment Board and Immigration; and  \n \n(iii)  slipway facilities \u2013 \u201ceven though in Fiji we have this facility it is not managed \nproperly. The monopoly status spoils the management\u2019s attitude which is \ndamaging its business and affecting our profits.\u201d \n \n4.  One respondent also queried the DOF stand on smoked fish (CO2 treated) noting \nthat: \n \nThe  Department  has  not  clarified  whether  this  process  is \nallowed or not. During my recent (Jan \u201905) visit to Los Angeles I \nfound that this product has a lucrative market and the USFDA \nhas no problems with the product. Other countries are legally \nexporting CO2 treated products to USA. Currently we export \nwhole fish fetching USD2.20/lb-USD2.50/lb for grade 2 & 2+, \nwhereas grade 3 treated fish earn much higher returns than \nwhat we are doing now also creating more jobs and activity \nlocally. \n \nIf this could be looked into and proper procedures and approval \nsystems developed to take advantage of the process this would \nbe economically beneficial for the companies and the nation.  \n \n5.  MFF responded to the above criticism by noting that the proposed smoked fish \nprocess (CO2 treated) is illegal in some markets and its use needs to be accompanied by \nhistamine certification. In addition, this is a product that is only imported from approved \nmarkets.  \n \n6.  Respondents were also asked to comment on negative aspects of their dealings with \nthe DOF, and some of the comments (note these are not the views of the review authors, but \nare merely presented to inform the Government about industry concerns) were as follows: \n \n(i)  fishing  license  terms  are  too  short  creating  uncertainty  about  investment \ndecisions \u2026 license application should be considered for a minimum of five \nyears; \n \n(ii)  unstable management of fisheries; \n \n(iii)  fish license processing time takes too long;  \n \n(iv)  the license vetting should be streamlined, based on history of vessels and \ntheir operations. The selection of vetting officers and licensing committee \nmembers should not be restricted to only members of statutory bodies but \nshould also include industry stakeholders;  \n \n(v)  involvement of too many government agencies in fishing operations, usually \nduplicating  each  other\u2019s  work,  eg.,  2  sets  of  officers  from  Fisheries  and \nCustoms (boarding and discharging), Immigration, Health, Quarantine, and \nFIMSA. This respondent added that: \u201con the one hand the Government\u2019s \nresources are wasted on so many civil servants involved in one job and on ", "86  Appendix 10 \nthe other it costs us loss of time and money, we have to pay overtime, \nattendance fee and meal and transport allowance to so many officers.\u201d;  \n \n(vi)  time to respond to correspondence and queries;  \n \n(vii)  lack of commercial and private sector understanding and experience; \n \n(viii)  lack of resources to undertake economic analysis; and \n \n(ix)  no provision of offshore tuna licenses to processors (which used to be the \napproach).  \n \n7.  It is suggested that the above comments and insights be taken into account by the \nGovernment in assessing ways of increasing the efficiency of the fishing industry. It is \nrecognized, however, that some of the above assessments are not consistent with sound \ngovernance and fisheries management. For example, there are no real economic efficiency \nbenefits associated with allocating licenses to processors, and the Fisheries Act does not \nallow licenses for processing plants but for fishing vessels. In addition, the separation of \nlegislators and industry is necessary for governance to prevail and consequently industry \ninvolvement in license allocation processes should be avoided.
