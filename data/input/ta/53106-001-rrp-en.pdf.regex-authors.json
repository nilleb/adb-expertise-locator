THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan of \nup to $30,200,000, comprising (i) an A loan of up to $11,300,000 and (ii) a B loan of up to \n$18,900,000 to TTC Energy Development Investment Joint Stock Company (the borrower) for the \nGulf Solar Power Project in Viet Nam. The report also describes the proposed administration of a \nloan of up to $7,600,000 to be provided by the Leading Asia\u2019s Private Sector Infrastructure Fund \n(LEAP)1. If the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me \nby the Board, approve the administration of the LEAP loan. \n \n2.  The loan will support the borrower with long-term financing to operate a 50-megawatt \n(MW) photovoltaic solar power plant and its associated facilities in Tay Ninh Province, Viet Nam. \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) financing will meet the borrower\u2019s requirements for longer-\ntenor, United States (US) dollar-denominated project financing, which local financial institutions \nare unable to provide. The financing will also catalyze commercial loans for one of the first large-\nscale solar power project finance transactions in the country. ADB\u2019s participation in the project \nwill also ensure compliance with rigorous environmental and social safeguard standards. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n3.  Project identification. High rates of economic growth and accelerated industrialization \nand urbanization are leading to growing demand for electricity in Viet Nam, which is on a path to \nbecoming the second-largest power market in Southeast Asia (after Indonesia) in the next five to \nten years. Access to electricity, which was below 10% of the population in 1986, is now nearly \nuniversal (98.7% in 2018). Electricity demand has grown rapidly in recent years, averaging 12.0% \nper year from 2005 to 2018, and is projected to grow at more than 8.0% per year through 2030. \nHowever, meeting fast-growing electricity demand and sustaining high rates of economic growth \nto improve livelihoods will be a significant challenge for Viet Nam. \n \n4.  Strong  projected  growth  in  electricity  demand  will  require  significant  private  sector \ninvestment in the energy sector. According to the National Power Development Plan, 2011\u20132020 \n(PDP VII), Viet Nam needs to invest about $148 billion in power transmission and generation \ninfrastructure from 2011 to 2030 to sustain high rates of economic growth.2  At the same time, the \nVietnamese energy sector is undergoing reforms to gradually deregulate and introduce market \nprinciples to encourage greater private sector participation. Because of the financial constraints \nof the state utility, Vietnam Electricity (EVN), the large exposure of domestic banks to state-owned \nenterprises, and limits to sovereign borrowing, private sector investment will be essential if \nViet Nam is to avoid future power shortages.  \n  \n5.  As  of  2016,  hydropower,  coal,  and  gas  comprised  nearly  90%  of  Viet  Nam\u2019s then \n42 gigawatts (GW) of installed power capacity. With limited potential to develop large-scale \nhydropower plants further, depleting domestic coal reserves, and growing public concern over \nenvironmental issues regarding coal-fired power plants, the development of renewable energy is \nreceiving greater focus. Viet Nam\u2019s revised PDP VII seeks to increase the share of renewable \nenergy, including small hydro, solar, wind, and biomass power plants, as a percentage of total \nforecast installed capacity to 21% (27 GW) by 2030 and to reduce the use of imported coal-fired \n \n1  Financing partner: Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). \n2  Government of Viet Nam. 2016. National Power Development Plan, 2011\u20132020, with outlook to 2030. Ha Noi. ", "2  \nelectricity. To meet this target, installed solar power capacity is expected to increase to 12 GW \nand wind power to 6 GW by 2030. Rapidly scaling up renewable energy use will also help Viet \nNam achieve its target to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 8%\u201325% by 2030. \n \n6.  In April 2017, the Prime Minister issued Decision No. 11/2017/QD-TTg to accelerate the \ndevelopment of private sector solar projects. This decision includes a provision for a 20-year feed-\nin tariff (FIT) of $0.0935 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) for utility-scale solar power projects. Developers \nwishing to receive the FIT were required to reach commercial operations by 30 June 2019 and \nuse the standard power purchase agreement (PPA) issued by the Ministry of Industry and Trade. \nAs a result of this policy, many local and international companies entered the market to develop \nsolar power projects in Viet Nam and benefit from the attractive FIT. By June 2019, 82 solar power \nplants, with a total capacity of nearly 4.5 GW, were commissioned and connected to the national \ngrid. This is much more than the target of 850 MW solar power by 2020 set out in the PDP VII, \nand the share of solar power in the country\u2019s power mix has consequently increased from less \nthan 0.5% to almost 10% in just a few months. While this is a great success story in terms of \nrenewable  energy  development,  the  need  for  sustainable  financing  solutions  remains  of \nparamount importance. \n \n7.  To qualify for the higher tariff, many developers decided to finance projects entirely with \nsponsor equity, short-term supplier credit, or corporate loans with short tenors in dong, delaying \nlong-term project financing consideration to a later stage.3 As evidenced by their market entry, \nthis project structure provided sufficiently high risk-adjusted expected returns for these developers \nwhen they could lock in a $0.0935 per kWh tariff. However, it exposes developers to significant \nrefinancing risks in a market that does not have well-established project finance structures for \nsolar power projects, especially because the standard PPA is not considered bankable for \ninternational lenders on a nonrecourse project finance basis. While local financial institutions are \nmore comfortable with the standard PPA, they lack experience with project finance, have limited \nfinancing capacity, and are unable to provide US dollar funding. Without access to long-term US \ndollar debt financing, international solar developers will be unable to recycle capital into project \ndevelopment and will struggle to build new projects once FITs are reduced in subsequent rounds \nof development. Without a viable project finance market for solar power in Viet Nam, the initial \nsurge of interest may not be sustained, making it more likely that fossil fuels will meet the rapidly \ngrowing power demand. \n \n8.  ADB\u2019s involvement in this project will support one of the first international limited-recourse \nfinancings for a solar power project in Viet Nam and will help to reduce commercial cofinanciers\u2019 \nrisk perception of renewable energy in Viet Nam at a critical time for the sector. ADB has taken \nthe lead in structuring a project finance solution with tailor-made sponsor support to address key \nrisks in Viet Nam\u2019s standard PPA for renewable energy and will ensure compliance with rigorous \nenvironmental and social safeguard standards. ADB will also mobilize commercial financing from \nregional and international lenders using a B loan structure. Additional support from concessional \nfunding provided by LEAP will improve the bankability and financial viability of the project, helping \nto catalyze the transaction and unlock access to long-term debt from international and regional \nbanks for utility-scale solar projects in Viet Nam. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED. \n \n \n \n3 The sponsors of the proposed project proceeded with the construction using shareholder loans in order to reach \ncommercial operations by 30 June 2019.

The project is aligned with the following impacts: (i) contribution of solar energy \nto Viet Nam\u2019s power supply increased and (ii) emission intensity per unit of gross domestic product \nreduced. \n \n13.  Outcome. The project\u2019s outcome is that the supply of clean power to Viet Nam\u2019s domestic \ngrid is increased. \n \n14.  Outputs. The output of the project is that a 50 MW photovoltaic solar power plant and its \nassociated facilities are operational. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n15.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project is consistent with \nADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, which outlines seven operational priorities to address the development \nchallenges in Asia and the Pacific.4 The project supports two of those priorities: (i) tackling climate \nchange, building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability; and \n(ii) addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequality. It also supports Strategy 2030\u2019s \nobjectives to expand the role of private sector operations and mobilize additional resources on \ntop of ADB\u2019s own financing. \n \n16.  The energy sector has been a priority for ADB\u2019s Viet Nam country program. Since 1994, \nADB has provided 16 sovereign loans for a total of $2.6 billion, three nonsovereign loans for a \ntotal of $250 million, and 43 technical assistance projects and grants for a total of $37.6 million to \nthe energy sector. ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Viet Nam, 2016\u20132020 aims to foster \ninclusive and environmentally sustainable growth. The project is aligned with two of the three \npillars of the strategy: (i) increasing the inclusiveness of infrastructure and service delivery and \n(ii) improving environmental sustainability and climate change response. Under the strategy, ADB \nwill increase the focus on renewable energy, including through public\u2013private partnerships, to \npromote sustainable growth.5 The project is also aligned with Viet Nam\u2019s commitments to the \n \n4  ADB. 2018.

Consistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. The project aligns \nwith ADB\u2019s Energy Policy, which supports wider access to energy through investments in energy \nefficiency and renewable energy projects.7 It will contribute to ADB\u2019s target of $6 billion in annual \nfinancing for climate mitigation and adaptation by 2020, and will increase Viet Nam\u2019s use of \nrenewable energy and reduce reliance on fossil fuels such as coal, thereby mitigating GHG \nemissions and reducing the need for fuel imports. Consistent with a \u201cOne ADB\u201d approach, the \nproject  benefitted  from  close  cross-departmental  coordination  with  ADB\u2019s  Southeast  Asia \nDepartment in assessing and analyzing Viet Nam\u2019s energy sector. \n \n18.  Lessons from previous operations. ADB has extensive experience in renewable energy \nprojects throughout Asia and has incorporated lessons learned from previous renewable energy \nprojects into structuring this project. The project also builds on the strong and long-standing \nrelationship between ADB and GED, the main sponsor of the project, and Thai banks participating \nin the financing.

Value Added by ADB Assistance \n20.  ADB adds value by mobilizing a financing package that makes the 50 MW solar project \ncommercially viable. International lenders are not comfortable offering long-term US dollar-\ndenominated debt on a nonrecourse basis in the Vietnamese market because of concerns \nregarding the PPA and the nascency of the solar power sector. Local banks lack experience with \nproject finance and are unable to offer US dollar-denominated longer tenor debt for infrastructure \nprojects. As one of the first international limited-recourse project finance transactions in Viet Nam, \nthe project will demonstrate the potential for private sector investment in Viet Nam\u2019s nascent \nrenewable energy sector, send a strong signal to the market and attract other investors for similar \ninvestments. ADB has led the structuring of the transaction and is crowding in commercial banks \nunder the B loan structure. ADB will also offer a longer tenor than participating commercial banks, \nhelping to improve debt service coverage ratios for lenders and thereby improve the financial \nviability of the project. \n \n21.  ADB\u2019s support for this project will demonstrate that innovative financing solutions can \naddress existing challenges in this nascent market. The successful financing of this project will \nlower the risk perception of the industry and help set a project finance precedent for utility-scale \nsolar power in Viet Nam. ADB\u2019s involvement and due diligence will ensure that the project is \ndeveloped and operated to international best practice standards and will perform to expectations \nover the project life. ADB\u2019s participation in the project will also ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s \nrigorous environmental and social safeguard standards. \n \nC.
