THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan of \nup to $20,000,000 to Da Nhim - Ham Thuan - Da Mi Hydro Power Joint Stock Company (DHD) \nfor the Floating Solar Energy Project in Viet Nam. The report also describes (i) the proposed \nadministration of a loan of up to $5,000,000 to be provided by the Leading Asia\u2019s Private \nInfrastructure Fund1 (LEAP); (ii) the proposed administration of a loan of up to $11,000,000 to be \nprovided by the Canadian Climate Fund for the Private Sector in Asia (CFPS)  under the Clean \nEnergy Financing Partnership Facility; and (iii) the proposed administration of a loan of up to \n$6,000,000 to be provided by the Canadian Climate Fund for the Private Sector in Asia II (CFPS \nII), and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by \nthe Board, approve the administration of the LEAP, CFPS, and CFPS II loans. \n  \n2.  The project entails the Asian Development Bank (ADB) providing financing to DHD to \ninstall 47.5 megawatts (MW) of floating solar photovoltaic power generation panels, on the man-\nmade reservoir of its existing 175 MW Da Mi hydropower plant. The ADB financing will meet \nDHD\u2019s requirements for longer-tenor, United States (US) dollar-denominated financing, which \nlocal lenders are unable to provide. The financing will catalyze the first large-scale floating solar \nphotovoltaic in the country. ADB\u2019s participation in the project will ensure compliance with rigorous \nenvironmental and social safeguard standards. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n3.  Project identification. Electricity demand in Viet Nam has grown rapidly, averaging \n12.0% per year in 2005\u20132015, and is projected to grow at more than 8.0% through 2030. Access \nto electricity, which was below 10% in 1986, grew to 98% in 2014. During this time, over 20 million \nhouseholds and industrial and commercial customers have been connected to the grid. The \nbiggest energy challenge is to provide those customers with reliable electricity and to meet future \ndemand. Per capita electricity consumption remains relatively low and is one-third of consumption \nof the People\u2019s Republic of China. Viet Nam\u2019s 42 gigawatts (GW) of installed capacity in 2016 \nwas dominated by hydropower, coal, and natural gas. Even though Viet Nam has abundant \npotential for renewable energy production,2 the installed capacity was about 7 MW for solar and \n135 MW for wind, accounting for less than 0.4% of total installed capacity by the end of 2016.3 \n  \n4.  Viet Nam has historically been a net energy exporter because of its large coal, oil, and \nnatural gas reserves, but since 2015, it has been importing coal because domestic coal supplies \nhave been insufficient to meet the higher domestic power demand.4 The southern half of the \ncountry has begun to have power shortages during the dry season. Strong projected electricity \ndemand growth, declining coal reserves, and limited potential to develop further large-scale hydro \nhave led the government to update the National Power Development Plan, 2011\u20132020. 5 The \nrevised plan seeks to increase the share of non-hydro renewable energy from nearly zero to 5,000 \n                                                \n1  Financing partner: Japan International Cooperation Agency. \n2  ADB. 2011.

Manila. \n3   Vietnam Electricity. 2017. Vietnam Electricity Annual Report 2016. Ha Noi. \n4   Viet Nam imported 10.5 million tons of coal in the first 9 months of 2016, 140% higher than the same period of 2015. \n5  Government of Viet Nam. 2016. Decision on the Approval of Revisions to the National Power Development Plan from \n2011 to 2020 with Visions Extended to 2030. No. 428/Q\u0110-TTg. Ha Noi (18 March). The Plan for 2021\u20132030 (PDP \nVIII) is currently being prepared. In addition to capacity, demand side management will be emphasized. ", "2 \nMW by 2020, and reduce the use of imported coal to produce electricity. In addition to using \nindigenous energy resources, solar photovoltaic power projects have short construction periods. \nIncreased deployment of solar power technology will support Viet Nam\u2019s urgent need to increase \ngeneration capacity and promote low emissions energy sources.  \n \n5.  The private sector is expected to provide most future investment in Viet Nam\u2019s generation \ncapacity, given the balance sheet constraints of the state utility (EVN), the exposure of domestic \nbanks to state-owned enterprises, and limits to concessional borrowing. In March 2016, the \ngovernment published the National Power Development Plan, 2011\u20132020, setting a target of 850 \nMW of solar and 800 MW for wind energy by 2020. In April 2017, the Prime Minister issued \nDecision No. 11/2017/QD-TTg to accelerate the development of private sector solar projects.6 \nThis decision includes a provision for a 20-year feed-in tariff (FIT) of $0.0935 per kilowatt-hour \n(kWh) for solar photovoltaic projects. Developers wishing to avail of the FIT need to reach \ncommercial  operation  by  30  June  2019  and  use  the  standard  domestic  power  purchase \nagreement (PPA) issued by the Ministry of Industry and Trade. While many international project \ndevelopers are interested in Viet Nam because the $0.0935 per kWh tariff is attractive, the terms \nof the domestic PPA and the lack of local finance options may make it difficult for Viet Nam to \nachieve its renewable energy development targets.7  \n \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n6.  Project design. The borrower, DHD, plans to install 47.5 MW of floating solar photovoltaic \npower generation panels, on the reservoir of its existing 175 MW Da Mi hydropower plant. This \nwill significantly increase Viet Nam\u2019s solar generation capacity by almost sevenfold from 7MW to \n54.5MW. Additional facilities include a floating central inverter, a grounded substation, and a new \n3.5-kilometer 110-kilovolt transmission line to connect with the national grid. \n  \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n7.  DHD will enter into a 20-year PPA with the national utility, EVN, to sell power generated \nby the solar facility to the grid using the solar power FIT regime. This project will be one of first \nutility-scale, solar power projects in Viet Nam; and one of the first large-scale floating solar \nprojects outside the People\u2019s Republic of China. \n \n8.  Borrower. Following the 2013 restructuring of EVN, DHD became a subsidiary of the \nnewly created Power Generation Corporation 1 (Genco 1), one of three regional generation \ncompanies of EVN. Genco 1 is a limited liability company of EVN that is legally independent with \nits own audited accounts, management, and board. Genco 1 is being privatized. Once completed, \nit will become a joint stock company owned by EVN and other investors. \n \n9.  DHD is legally independent and separate from Genco 1 and EVN. It owns and operates \nfour hydropower plants: Da Mi (175 MW), Ham Thuan (300 MW), Da Nhim (160 MW), and Song \nPha (7.5 MW). DHD\u2019s total generation capacity is 642.5 MW, about 1.7% of Viet Nam\u2019s generation \ncapacity.8  \n                                                \n6  Government of Viet Nam. 2017.

Matrix of Review of Decision No. 11/2017/QD-TTG of the Prime Minister dated 11 April 2017 \n8  At the end 2016, the total generation capacity of Viet Nam was 42.1 GW, of which EVN's capacity was 25.9 GW \n(61.4%), PetroVietnam 4.4 GW (10.5%), Vinacomin 1.8 GW (4.2%), and independent power producers (IPPs) and \nbuild-operate-transfers 10.0 GW (23.9%). EVN, PetroVietnam, and Vinacomin are state-owned enterprises. \n ", "3 \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n10.  Integrity due diligence was conducted.9 No tax due diligence was required, as the project \nis entirely owned and structured through Vietnamese companies. ADB\u2019s review of DHD does not \ngive ADB cause to believe that such entity has been established, or is being used for cross-border \ntax evasion, money laundering, or terrorism financing in the jurisdictions involved in the project. \nAn international auditor, KPMG, has audited DHD\u2019s accounts since 2016. \n \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n11.  Impact.  The  National  Power  Development  Plan,  2011\u20132020  aims  to  prioritize  the \ndevelopment of renewable energy sources for power production.10 The project is aligned with \nincreasing the contribution of solar energy to Viet Nam\u2019s power supply. The project also supports \nthe government\u2019s commitment to reducing the emission intensity per unit of gross domestic \nproduct.11  \n \n12.  Outcome. The project will have the following outcome: increased supply of clean power \nto the domestic grid. It will generate about 63,138 megawatt-hours of electricity per year and \nreduce about 30,302 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO e) emissions per year.12 \n2\n \n13.  Outputs. The outputs of the project will be the development of a 47.5 MW floating \nphotovoltaic plant and its associated facilities. Construction and operation of the plant will also \ngenerate employment for the local community, including economic opportunities for women, and \nstimulate the local and national economy. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n14.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 outlined \nseven operational priorities to address the development challenges in Asia and the Pacific.13 The \nproject supports two of those priorities: (i) addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequality, \nand  (ii)  tackling  climate  change,  building  climate  and  disaster  resilience,  and  enhancing \nenvironment sustainability.  \n \n15.  The energy sector has been a priority sector in ADB\u2019s Viet Nam country program. Since \n1994, ADB has provided 16 sovereign loans for a total $2.6 billion, two nonsovereign loans for a \ntotal of $150 million, and 43 technical assistance projects and grants for a total $37.6 million to \nthe energy sector. ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Viet Nam, 2016\u20132020 aims to foster \ninclusive and environmentally sustainable growth. The project is aligned with two of the three \npillars of the strategy: (i) increasing the inclusiveness of infrastructure and service delivery and \n(ii) improving environmental sustainability and climate change response. Under the strategy, ADB \n                                                \n9  ADB. 2003. Enhancing the Asian Development Bank's Role in Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of \nTerrorism.

Consistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. The project aligns \nwith ADB\u2019s energy policy, which encourages interventions designed to shift reliance on fossil fuel \nsources for energy to renewable forms of energy to slow down the growth of greenhouse gas \n(GHG) emissions and help countries achieve energy self-sufficiency.15 The project will increase \nViet Nam\u2019s use of renewable energy and reduce reliance on fossil fuels such as coal thereby \nmitigating GHGs. It is also aligned with Viet Nam\u2019s commitments to the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change, and will contribute to ADB\u2019s target of providing $80.0 billion in \nclimate finance by 2030.16  \n \n17.  Lessons from previous operations. This is the first large-scale, private sector, floating \nsolar project for Viet Nam and ADB. The project carefully considered experience from previous \nground-mounted solar projects. ADB has extensive experience in renewable energy projects \nthroughout Asia, and has incorporated lessons learned from previous renewable energy projects \ninto the deal structure.17 The project builds on results and lessons from the close cooperation \nbetween ADB sovereign operations and the Government of Viet Nam for energy sector reform.18 \n \n18.  ADB has provided substantial support to the PPP enabling environment in Viet Nam, \nalthough its investment in PPP projects has been limited.19 The last major PPP project ADB \ninvested in was in 2002. The key issues that have impeded investments include (i) transparency \nin regulations and implementation, (ii) risk allocation between the public and private sectors, \n(iii) land use rights, (iv) cost-recovery tariffs, and (v) availability of long-term debt. While a new \nPPP decree was issued in April 2015 to encourage private sector investments, private sector \nparticipation in infrastructure is still nascent. \n \nD.

Projected Financial and Economic Performance \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n20.  ADB assistance will have four components: (i) a direct loan of up to $20 million, (ii) a \nparallel loan of up to $5 million from LEAP, (iii) a concessional loan from the CFPS of up to $11 \nmillion, and (iv) a concessional loan from the CFPS II of up to $6 million. The direct loan will be \nprovided from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources. All loans will have a tenor of up to 15 years, \nincluding a 1-year grace period on principal repayment. During the life of the corporate loans, \nDHD will be bound by financial and operational covenants stipulated in the loan agreement. \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n21.  ADB adds value by mobilizing a financing package that makes the 47.5 MW floating solar \nproject commercially viable. International lenders are not comfortable with the current domestic \nPPA terms and local banks lack experience in financing renewable energy projects. Local banks \nare also unable to lend in US dollars or provide the longer tenor debt that such infrastructure \nprojects require. The project is one of Viet Nam\u2019s first independent power producer (IPP) \nrenewable energy infrastructure and floating solar technology is new to the country. ADB\u2019s \nsupport for such IPPs and innovative technology will potentially catalyze other investors to do \n ", "6 \nsimilar investments, and commercial financiers to lower their risk perception of the industry. This \nproject will also be instrumental in helping EVN learn how to dispatch intermittent renewable \npower at scale. ADB\u2019s participation in the project will also ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s rigorous \nenvironmental and social safeguard standards and will improve the promotion of gender equity. \n \n22.  The participation of concessional loans from the CFPS and CFPS II was necessary to \nimprove the financial viability of the project because of the additional costs and risks associated \nwith  developing  the  first  floating  solar  power  project  in  the  country  and  the  region.  The \nconcessional financing was designed to fill a funding gap, to move financial ratios and returns \npart-way towards private sector norms, and to demonstrate a viable financing model for other \nprivate sector developers to encourage scale-up and replication. The concessional financing was \nstructured and approved by CFPS I and CFPS II in concert with ADB\u2019s fund management team \nand is aligned with Development Finance Institution agreed principles on the use of blended \nconcessional financing for the private sector. \n \nC.  Risks \n [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n23.  ADB  has  categorized  the  investment  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement  (SPS,  2009)  as  follows:  environment  (category  B),  involuntary  resettlement \n(category B), and indigenous peoples (category C). \n \n24.  ADB has undertaken due diligence and reviewed the potential environmental and social \nimpacts of the project and the measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for adverse \nimpacts in the safeguard reports and plans. The environmental and social measures and the \ninstitutional capacity and commitment of DHD to manage the project\u2019s social and environmental \nimpacts are deemed adequate. The ADB investment will be provided at the corporate level but \nwill primarily support the floating solar project, so ADB\u2019s SPS requirements for general corporate \nfinance apply to this project. Qualified and experienced external experts conducted an audit of \nDHD\u2019s environmental, health and safety, and social policies, procedures, and operations. The \naudit assessed DHD\u2019s (i) compliance with local regulations and current environmental, health and \nsafety, and social policies and procedures, and (ii) past and current performance against the \nobjectives, principles, and requirements of ADB\u2019s SPS. The audit recommended corrective \nactions at corporate and subproject level (i.e., floating solar) to comply with ADB\u2019s SPS and other \nsocial requirements. The corrective action plan includes developing an environmental and social \nmanagement system (ESMS) procedure to streamline DHD\u2019s procedures throughout the project \ncycle, and enhancing its community health and safety plan, which will be appended to the ESMS. \nIt also requires detailed assessments to be undertaken of project biodiversity and social impacts, \nand enhancement of the project-specific environmental and social management plan (ESMP). \n \n25.
