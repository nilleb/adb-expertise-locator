THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FACILITY\nA. Justification\n1. The  proposal.  The  transaction  technical  assistance  (TA)  facility  will  support  the\n(i) deployment of renewable energy, (ii) regulatory interventions to improve energy efficiency and\nrenewable energy penetration, (iii) identification of climate resilient investments, and (iv) increase\nin project readiness of pipeline projects and support its implementation. The TA will also provide\nsupport innovation in project design, project sustainability and transfer capacity through specific\ntraining and skills-building activities for ensuing projects and implementation support for ongoing\nprojects as required. Initially, the TA facility will support:\n(i) Climate Resilient and Sustainable Energy Transition Project;1\n(ii) Additional financing for Rooftop Solar Generation Project;2 and\n(iii) Power System Reliability Strengthening Project.3\n2. Sector  overview.  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  energy  sector  performance  has  achieved  a  national\nelectrification ratio of 99.6% (2018), up from 29% in 1990. However, the sector continues to\nstruggle in meeting the growing demand due to high electricity generation cost emanating from\nincreasing share of oil-fired thermal power in generation mix and inadequate level of power\nsystem reliability. The increasing share of oil-fired thermal generation poses a serious threat to\nthe country\u2019s energy security and the environment. There is an urgent need to develop other clean\nenergy sources in addition to hydropower, undertake loss reduction efforts, and improve the\npower system reliability.\n3. Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), the single electricity buyer and transmission licensee has\nbeen in financial stress due to (i) increasing share of oil-fired thermal generation, (ii) delay in\nplanned low-cost generation plants, (ii) below cost recovery tariffs, and (iv) absence of formal\nmechanism for the government to provide revenue subsidies for keeping tariff below the approved\ncost of supply. Hence, CEB has been dependent on short term borrowings to bridge the revenue\nshortfall resulting in poor financial position and increasing debt levels. The electricity revenue gap\nneeds to be filled through either a subsidy from the government or tariff increase, or a combination\nof both. However, the economic impacts that followed from the Easter bomb-blasts in 2019 and\nthe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic have created additional challenges, making it\ndifficult to increase the tariffs to cost recovery levels in the near term due to affordability issues\non vulnerable consumers and sectors. From January to July 2020, CEB\u2019s total electricity sales\ndeclined by 3.5% on a year-on-year basis compared with the corresponding period of 2019 due\nto reduction in sales from all user categories, except households and government sector. There\nhas also been reduction in bill collections compared to 2019 from the affected businesses such\n1  This ensuing project will support renewable energy deployment and develop climate resilient transmission and \ndistribution investments to improve power system reliability. This ensuing project is named as Power System \nReliability Strengthening Project \u2013 Phase 2 in Sri Lanka country operations business plan, 2021\u20132023 (ADB. 2020. \nCountry Operations Business Plan: Sri Lanka, 2021\u20132023. Manila).  \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved the Solar Rooftop Generation Project in 2017 (ADB. Sri Lanka: \nRooftop Solar Power Generation Project), aiming to support the government\u2019s Battle for Solar Energy Program. The \nproject is in advanced stages of implementation, expecting installation of 60 megawatts (MW) solar rooftop systems \nby 2021. The additional financing will scale up the ongoing project and expand the rooftop solar development in Sri \nLanka.  \n3  The fact-finding mission for this proposed project was conducted in November 2020. Project preparation is in the \nadvanced stages and approval is expected in 2021. The TA will support the implementation of gender sensitive \nworkplace practices under this project after its approval. This project is included as a firm project in Sri Lanka country \noperations business plan 2021\u20132023. ", "2 \nas tourism which has affected CEB\u2019s over 99% collection ratio.  The crisis further emphasizes the \nneed to improve the sector\u2019s financial viability by reducing electricity generation costs by timely \nimplementation of low-cost generation plants, further improvement in operational efficiencies, \nregulatory reforms aimed at market-based incentives for renewable energy deployment and \ndevelopment of a financial recovery plan to improve financial sustainability of CEB and the power \nsector.  \n4. Government\u2019s vision. The government has recently set an ambitious target of achieving\n70% share of power generation through renewable energy by 2030.4 The National Energy Policy\nand Strategies of Sri Lanka 20195 envisages the energy sector to ensure energy security through\nsupplies that are cleaner, secure, economical, and reliable to provide convenient, and affordable\nenergy services to support socially equitable development of the country. The energy policy and\nthe nationally determined contributions (NDC) identify investing in renewable energy, switching\ntowards cleaner energy sources, enhancing climate resilience, and improving energy efficiency\nas vital steps to improve the national energy security. The energy sector has a 25% greenhouse\ngas emission reduction target in the NDCs (5% unconditionally and 20% conditionally) by 2030\nand this is expected to be achieved through investments in renewable energy,6 introducing\ndemand-side  management  activities,  strengthening  sustainable  energy-related  policies,  and\nadopting liquefied natural gas to replace fuel oil-based electricity generation.\n5. The energy sector assessment, strategy, and roadmap of Sri Lanka prepared by the Asian\nDevelopment Bank (ADB)7 identify (i) facilitating development and deployment of renewable\nenergy;  (ii)  strengthening  and  modernizing  transmission  and  distribution  assets  to  improve\nreliability, resilience and enhance renewable penetration; (iii) improving energy efficiency and\ndemand management; (iv) capacity building to leapfrog technological advancements in energy\nsector; and (v) promoting institutional reform as the key areas to be focused on in future energy\nsector operations. The main areas considered in future interventions include scaling up of\nrenewable  energy  deployment  through  mobilizing  private  investments  in  transparent  and\ncompetitive manner, improving the financial sustainability of power sector, supporting energy\nstorage and climate resilient grid enhancement, and capacity building support and pilot testing of\nfuture potential technologies (i.e., off sore wind, floating solar, green hydrogen) applicable to Sri\nLanka. The replacement of liquid fuel-based generation with renewables and cleaner sources,\npresents an important opportunity for the country to reduce generation cost, meet growing energy\ndemand and diversify the power generation mix.\n6. ADB\u2019s experience. ADB has been one of the country\u2019s largest multilateral financing\npartners in the power sector supporting across all the subsectors\u2013generation, transmission, and\ndistribution. ADB also has broad experience in Sri Lanka\u2019s renewable energy subsector through\nvarious ongoing projects such as (i) 30.5 megawatts (MW) Moragolla hydropower plant and its\nassociated infrastructure, (ii) systematic development of 100 MW Mannar wind power generation\nproject including its power evacuation facilities, (iii) a credit line facility  to install about 60 MW of\nsolar  rooftop  capacity,  and  (iv)  support  for  developing  prospective  renewable  parks  at\nSiyambalanduwa, Pooneryn and Mannar phase 2. ADB\u2019s Sri Lanka\u2019s energy sector operation is\nincreasingly focusing its attention on increasing renewable energy penetration, energy efficiency,\n4  The government of Sri Lanka took a cabinet decision to pursue necessary action to meet 70% of the total electricity \ndemand of the country from renewable energy by 2030. (Office of the Cabinet of Ministers \u2013 Sri Lanka. 2021. Press \nBriefing of Cabinet Decision Taken on 13 September 2021. Colombo). \n5  Ministry of Power, Energy and Business Development. 2019.

These are emerging areas for the executing and \nimplementing agencies in the country for which in-house capacity is still lacking.8 Sri Lanka also \nneed to further deregulate the power sector, introduce regulatory reforms to provide market-based \nincentives to mobilize private investments to the sector in a transparent and competitive manner. \nThis includes provision of open access to transmission and distribution network for renewable \nenergy generators and large consumers, renewable purchase obligations to large consumers and \ntradable renewable energy certificates to create additional revenues for investors in renewable \nenergy. ADB can also provide transaction advisory services to structure renewable energy \ncapacity procurement using highly successful solar park concept in India, where dedicated \ngovernment agencies develop the basic infrastructure and invite the investments from private \nsector in a competitive basis.   \n7. The proposed TA will help the executing and implementing agencies to meet government\nand ADB financing requirements by supporting project preparation, improving project readiness,\nbuilding capacity for implementation, and overall portfolio performance. This proposed TA will\ncomplement government agencies and build upon their strengths to develop and implement\nenergy sector infrastructure projects in emerging areas. This TA supports the priorities of ADB\nStrategy 2030,9 namely: (i) tackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience and\nenhancing environmental sustainability; (ii) accelerating progress in gender equality by supporting\nactivities and trainings to facilitate gender sensitive workplace practices and project components\nin project design; and (iii) strengthening governance and institutional capacity. This TA is listed in\nthe current Sri Lanka country operations business plan.10\n8. The impact of the ensuing projects will be supporting sustainable development of the\nenergy sector through (i) increased renewable and cleaner power generation, (ii) improved quality\nof electricity, and (iii) enhanced energy security. The outcome of this TA is to develop ensuing\nprojects into feasible investments to support the energy sector. These projects are in the energy\nsector and have similar due diligence requirements and implementation arrangements. The TA\napproach is suitable as it will allow (i) use of common resources to prepare and support projects\nin the same subsector, thereby enhancing project preparation and implementation efficiency;\n(ii) executing agency and implementing agencies to ensure adoption of uniform approach and\nproject implementation arrangements; and (iii) smooth coordination between consultants and\nproject team. Overall, this TA will reduce the transaction costs and time through minimizing the\nresources required of stand-alone transaction TA.\nB. Outputs and Activities\n9.
