During the 2000 Country Programming Mission and subsequent consultation missions, \nthe Government of Papua New Guinea (PNG) requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nfor a possible loan to the health sector. This assistance has been included in ADB\u2019s program for \nconsideration by the Board in the year 2004. The PNG health sector faces severe problems, \nwith key health indicators either stagnating or declining. The goal of the National Health Plan \n(NHP) 2001\u20132010 is to improve the health of all Papua New Guineans through the development \nof a health system that is responsive, effective, affordable, and accessible to the majority of the \npeople.  The  Government  is  committed  to  improving  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  all \nresources provided to the sector. To achieve this objective, the National Department of Health \n(NDOH) is implementing a sector-wide approach (SWAp).1 \n \n2.  The ADB strategy for PNG continues to give high priority to poverty reduction, notably \nthrough human capital development, with basic social services as a significant focus. Thirty-\nseven percent of the population lives in poverty, nearly all in rural areas. PNG ranks last in the \nPacific on the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) human development and poverty \nindexes, reflecting past underfunding of essential services and the difficulty of providing them \nacross remote and scattered regions. The situation is worsened by slow economic growth and \nfiscal  constraints.  The  technical  assistance  (TA)2  objectives,  scope,  financing,  and \nimplementation arrangements were reconfirmed during a Fact-Finding Mission on 4\u201323 October \n2002. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  ADB is a long-term partner to the PNG health sector and has supported it since 1982.3 \nSeveral  relatively  large-scale  projects  have  been  implemented  to  establish,  extend,  and \nmaintain rural health infrastructure (aid posts, health centers, staff housing) to increase isolated \ncommunities\u2019 accessibility to essential health services. Support also included rural water supply, \nprocurement  of  medical  equipment,  radio  and  communication  equipment,  and  transport. \nEvaluations have confirmed the improved accessibility to primary health care (PHC) facilities in \nmany remote parts of the country. However, extending facilities did not solve the problems of \nclosure or limited operation of facilities due to shortage of staff, insufficient drugs, malfunctioning \nequipment, and poor maintenance of buildings. Therefore, the real impact of an extended \nnetwork of PHC facilities in terms of increased and continuous accessibility to essential PHC \nservices was less obvious and generally not reflected in improved health indicators. The main \nlesson is that extending the health network has to go hand in hand with adjustments in the \nrecurrent budget to run those facilities, and with provision of human resources, the necessary \nequipment,  continuous  supply  of  drugs  and  materials,  and  continuous  support  to,  and \nsupervision of, the health staff. In short, extending the health network requires a well-functioning \nhealth system and forward planning of resources.  \n   \n4.  In March 1997, ADB approved the Health Sector Development Program (HSDP),4 which \nemphasized  performance  of  rural  health  service  delivery,  especially  health  promotion  and \n                                                 \n1  The World Health Organization defines SWAp as a mechanism to coordinate donor assistance in a sector, \nwhereby \u201call significant funding for the sector supports a single sector policy and expenditure program, under \ngovernment leadership, adopting common approaches across the sector, and progressing toward relying on \ngovernment procedures to disburse and account for all funds.\u201d  \n2 The TA was first listed in ADB Business Opportunities on 12 November 2002.  \n3  Loan 586-PNG: First Rural Health Services Project, 1982\u20131986; Loans No. 746-PNG(SF) and 747-PNG: Second \nRural Health Services Project 1987 - 1991; Loan No. 1054-PNG(SF): Special Intervention Project \u2013 SIP, 1991 - \n1993; Loan No. 1097-PNG(SF): Third Rural Health Services Project, 1992 \u2013 2000. \n4 Loan 1516-PNG for $45 million, Loan 1517-PNG(SF) for $5 million, and Loan 1518-PNG for $10 million \n ", "2  \nprevention. Improved sector performance was aimed at increased resource allocation to rural \nhealth service delivery (including drugs and medical supplies), financial reforms (increased \nhospital revenue from hospital fees), and the introduction of pipeline funding of ADB funds \nthrough the HSDP Trust Fund Account to NDOH and to all provinces. The allocation of HSDP \nfunds to provinces allows provincial authorities to finance priorities in the provincial health plan. \nGuidelines and strict procedures for the use of funds have been developed. Funds can be used \nfor all types of expenditures based on priorities stipulated and agreed on in the provincial health \nplan, with the exception of salaries and wages. For the provincial health authorities, access to \nadditional funds to maintain and improve service delivery was essential. \n \n5.  The HSDP was a fundamentally new approach for PNG. This approach (assistance \nearmarked to the health sector but focused on agreed-on priorities in the NHP) and financing \nmechanisms (pipeline funding to the level of the health system that is responsible for service \ndelivery, be it the province or district) are building blocks of a SWAp to health. As a result of the \nvery  good  performance  of  the  HSDP  Trust  Fund  Account,  independently  confirmed  by  a \nmanagement audit,5 this financing and accounting mechanism is now considered by all major \ndonors and NDOH as the best financing mechanism to assist the health sector. Australian \nAgency for International Development (AusAID) and New Zealand Agency for International \nDevelopment (NZAID) have joined the same funding mechanism (now called the Health Sector \nImprovement Programme [HSIP] Trust Fund) to transfer earmarked funds to provincial health \nactivities, and the World Bank has expressed interest in joining a SWAp based on this model. \nThis is a fundamental change in how government and donors do business together. \n \n6.  ADB provided TA6 to the Government for a health sector review to identify modalities \nand priority areas for assistance in the light of experience, and to assess whether policies, skills, \nand  management  systems  are  compatible  with  the  requirements  of  a  SWAp,  should  the \nGovernment request further ADB assistance for the health sector. The health sector review \nfound that despite a coherent framework for health sector activity, as evidenced by the new \nNHP, the performance of the sector over recent years has been mixed. While gains have been \nmade in the demographic indicators over the last decade, with an increase in life expectancy \nfrom 52 years at the 1990 census to 54 years in 1996, the infant mortality rate has risen from 72 \nto 77 per 1,000 births. Per capita domestic resources for health have risen by 4% and this has \nbeen brought about by increasing the proportion of the National budget spent on health from \n4.8% in 1996 to 6.2% in 1999. Compared to its Pacific country neighbors, however, PNG \nspends the lowest proportion of gross national product (GNP) on health and also has the lowest \nlevel of health expenditure per capita. These overall figures mask significant interprovincial \ndifferences. While national indicators are poor, some provinces have made significant progress \nover 1996-2001, increasing performance by over 50%. Provincial health administrators of those \nprovinces confirm that access to flexible HSDP funds7 have been the most significant change \n                                                 \n5 HSIP Trust Fund Account Management Review, Health Sector Monitoring and Review Group, AusAID, March \n2002.  \n6 ADB. 2001. Health Sector Review. Manila. \n7 Of paramount importance to the success of the HSDP was the introduction of measures, which established \nminimum performance levels in the provinces as a prerequisite to qualify for continued HSDP funding. This was \npossible as HSDP funding was appropriated at the level of the NDOH. It was under no obligation to provide \nfunds to a given province although the objectives of the NHP can be met only through the active support of \nprovinces, which, in turn, implement their annual health activity plans. To qualify for continued HSDP funding the \nprovinces must comply with the following minimum requirements: (i) Expenditure undertaken is identified in the \nAnnual Health Activity Plan and/or is in respect of national priorities; (ii) Only expenditure authorized at the \ndecentralized level, as defined in the procedures manual, has been undertaken; (iii) Value for money has been \nobtained on the basis of competitive pricing process; (iv) All original supportive documentation is present and \nfiled for all expenditure; (v) Monthly cashbook and bank reconciliation is provided to the HSDP secretariat; (vi) \nMinimum 80 % of expenditure acquitted (balance carried over to next review); (vii) Previously identified issues \nare resolved. ", "      3\nover the past years and an important reason for improved performance. The same provinces \nalso tend to use more HSDP funds. In short, provinces with adequate capacity to manage \nresources have been able to use HSDP funds to circumvent some of the structural constraints \nof the health sector. \n \n7.  The health sector review concluded that the main area for change is the organization \nand management of the sector, with a strong focus on service delivery. The objectives are to \nconsolidate the progress made under HSDP by some provinces, extend the gains to other non-\nperforming provinces, to institutionalize the management systems put in place at the central \nlevel, and to increase the efficiency in the utilization of resources. To reach these objectives will \nrequire strong leadership by the Government to implement the necessary changes, and to fully \nmobilize  the  scarce  management  resources  and  capabilities  of  NDOH.  It  has  expressed \nfrustration with the large number of health projects it has to manage, which diverts management \ncapabilities away from sector management. The main advantages of a SWAp are increased \ngovernment leadership and control and in the strengthening of systems and capacities. In \naddition, a high level of donor coordination is required in PNG, and the sector-wide approach is \nthe most adequate system to ensure this coordination. The test over time will be the outcome in \nterms of real efficiencies in resource use and improvements in health service delivery and \nsatisfaction of consumers with these services.  \n \n8.  The building blocks for a SWAp in the health sector already exist in PNG. A number of \nsignificant  reforms  will  need  to  be  needed  over  the  coming  years  before  a  full  SWAp  is \nachieved. Government and donors will have to move from informal to formal joint performance \nagreements, including common management arrangements. The SWAp, as part of a broader \ngovernment-wide agreement between Government and donors, will have to take into account \noverall macro-level agreements, including structural adjustment programs,  public sector reform, \nthe  National  Medium-Term  Development  Strategy,  and  the  Medium-Term  Expenditure \nFramework.  \n \n9.  These conclusions were presented to government agencies and donors, which decided \nthat the Department of National Planning and Rural Development (DNPRD) would set up a \ncross-sectoral working group, with representation of interested key ministries, donors, and key \nstakeholders to formally start preparing a SWAp in health, have a statement of intent signed by \nall interested partners, and define the work that should be accomplished over the next 6 months \n(and  beyond)  to  formally  start  a  SWAp.  The  working  group8  has  met  three  times.  Three \ntechnical committees (TCs) will prepare and inform the working group\u2019s meetings on specific \nissues.  \n \n10.  The Government has requested ADB\u2019s assistance for the TCs and to organize broad \nparticipatory consultations to prepare the first phase of the SWAp, with a view toward the \npossibility of additional ADB assistance. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output  \n \n11.  The  TA  will  help  prepare  and  design  a  sector  development  program,  for  possible \nfinancing by the ADB, that will enable the Government to introduce and implement the reforms \n                                                 \n8 Members of the Working Group include officials from the NDOH, DNPRD, Department of Education, Public Sector \nReform  Unit,  Department  of  Finance,  Churches  Medical  Council,  Department  of  Intergovernmental  Affairs \n(provinces), donors. \n ", "4  \nrequired to improve health services delivery in PNG under a SWAp. These reforms will be \nidentified by the TCs, to which ADB will provide TA. \n \n12.  The Government and donors recognize that past approaches are failing and, with the \ndeteriorating economic situation likely to worsen things in the near future, new mechanisms are \nneeded to improve performance. A number of significant reforms will need to be implemented \nover the coming years to move gradually to a full SWAp in the health sector, building on the \nsuccesses  of  the  HSDP/HSIP  and  the  widely  shared  recognition  that  a  new  approach  is \nrequired. The TA will assist in preparing the Policy Matrix detailing the program of reforms. The \nGovernment  and  donors  will  have  to  move  from  informal  to  joint  formal  performance \nagreements, including common  management arrangements through the following indicative \nprocess: \n \n(i)  government and donors formally agree on a sector plan based on the existing NHP \n2001-2010 as the policy framework for a medium-term strategic plan (or 3-year rolling \nplan). \n(ii) government and donors agree on the most important priorities within the plan, with a \nfocus on improving service delivery in the short term, and special attention to the most \nvulnerable communities and people. \n(iii) government and donors agree on what the most effective strategies would be to affect \nsector performance. Agreed-on standards of supportive supervision should be part of \nthe  Memorandum  of  Understanding  or  the  Code  of  Practice  and  the  performance \nagreements with provinces. \n(iv) government and donors agree on a realistic resource envelope needed to implement \nthose changes (a medium-term expenditure framework [MTEF]). \n(v) government and donors agree on the modalities for resource flows.  \n(vi) Government and donors plan to move progressively to common management systems \nand procedures. \n(vii) government  and  donors  agree  on  how  sector  performance  and  progress  will  be \nmonitored  (indicators,  sources)  and  through  which  mechanisms  (routine  health \ninformation system, annual performance review, etc.). \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n13.  The TA will help the Working Group prepare a 6-month action plan to put the essential \nelements of the SWAp in place and support the three TCs identified by the working group: \n \n(i)  program, to work on planning and prioritization, and resource allocation; \n(ii)  finance, in charge of issues relating to financial management and procurement; \nand \n(iii)  management, to work on monitoring, supportive supervision, and performance-\nbased contracting. \n \n14.  Based on the experience developed by ADB through previous projects and in other \nsectors, ADB\u2019s assistance is sought in financial management, procurement, monitoring, and the \ndevelopment of MTEF. As regards procurement, the Public Finance Management Act (1995, \nrevised in 1999) is fundamentally sound, but procedures in internal management are needed. \nAn international audit firm conducted a procurement and expenditure review in 2001-2002 in all \nbranches of NDOH and the HSDP/HSIP Trust Account. The firm\u2019s recommendations are under \nimplementation. The finance TC will have to (i) identify the need for assistance to the NDOH to \nfully implement the recommendations of the firm, and (ii) propose a methodology acceptable to \nall parties for procurement through pooled funds. The TA will take into account the work already ", "      5\nundertaken by ADB and the World Bank on standardization of procurement procedures. The \nuse of a private sector procurement agent might be envisaged. The program TC will base its \nwork and recommendations on the annual sector reviews of 2001 and 2002, and the health \nsector review. The reforms needed to ensure the successful implementation of the SWAp and \nimprove the sector\u2019s performance will serve as a basis for a framework for assistance. \n \n15.  A broad consultation with all stakeholders, particularly in the provinces, will be ensured. \nAusAID has also committed to help the TCs, and discussions are ongoing with the World Bank. \n   \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $630,000 equivalent, comprising $441,000 in \nforeign exchange costs and $189,000 equivalent in local currency costs. ADB will finance the \nentire foreign exchange cost and $59,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be \nfinanced by ADB on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of \nJapan. The balance of $130,000 equivalent will be provided by the Government through the \nprovision of counterpart staff, support services, and office facilities. Detailed cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are provided in Appendix 3. The Government has been advised that approval of \nthe TA does not commit ADB to financing any ensuing project. The expected loan amount for \nthe subsequent assistance is estimated to be $20 million. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  To ensure the broadest participation from all sectors, DNPRD will be the Executing \nAgency and the lead agency in terms of overall assistance to the Government. NDOH will \nprovide office space and counterpart staff and services. The total duration of the proposed TA \nwill be 8 months, from February 2003 to October 2003. The TA will require 14 person-months of \ninternational consulting services, including: (i) a health financial management and procurement \nspecialist for 5 person-months, (ii) a health monitoring specialist for 5 person-months, and (iii) a \nhealth planning specialist for 4 person-months. The consultants will be recruited on an individual \nbasis, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Terms of reference are \nin Appendix 4. The TA will provide for a series of workshops and consultative meetings in the \nprovinces, to ensure broad participation in the SWAp\u2019s formulation. \n \n18.  With the support of NDOH and DNPRD, the consultants will help the TCs organize and \nconduct  workshops/discussion  groups  involving  provincial  and  local  government \nrepresentatives,  nongovernment  organizations,  churches,  donors,  and  all  other  relevant \nstakeholders.  The  consultants  will  submit  (i)  an  inception  report  1  month  after  TA \ncommencement, (ii) a draft final report in June 2003, and (iii) a final report within 2 months of TA \ncompletion. \nIV.

The team will work with and report to the Department of National Planning and \nRural  Development  (DNPRD).  The  TA  will  involve  extensive  consultations  with  the \nNational Department of Health (NDOH), as well as other central agencies, in particular \nthe Department of Public Management, Department of Finance, Public Service Reform \nManagement Unit, Department of Inter-Government Relations, provincial governments, \nchurches and other nongovernmental providers of health services, and other donors. \nThe  consultants  are  expected  to  collaborate  closely  with  Australian  Agency  for \nInternational Development (AusAID) and the World Bank. \n \n \nB.  Terms of Reference \n2.  The consultants will do the following: \n \n(i)  Help  the  working  group  technical  committees  prepare  the  basic \nrequirements for the donors and the Government to move to a sector-\nwide approach (SWAp)-based assistance framework. \n(ii)  Help the Government prepare a program for assistance from the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). \n \n3.  The health planning specialist will coordinate the work. The consultant will submit \na progress report to the Government and ADB in May 2003. The team will develop a \nprogram logical framework/policy matrix and submit it to the Government and ADB as \npart of the draft final report. The TA will identify the adjustment costs of the reforms \nneeded  in  the  three  areas  covered.  A  series  of  workshops  and  seminars  will  be \norganized  in  the  provinces  to  ensure  a  broad  participation  of  stakeholders,  from \ngovernmental and nongovernmental agencies, in the preparation of the SWAp.  \n \n1.
