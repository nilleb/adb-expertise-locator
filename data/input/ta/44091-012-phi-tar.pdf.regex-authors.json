", " \nI.  INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Philippine Department of Energy (DOE) requested the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) to provide policy and advisory technical assistance (TA) to assist the government of the \nPhilippines in managing consumer protection as the power sector moves toward open access1 \nand electricity retail market competition.2 This is part of the government\u2019s ongoing reform of the \npower sector that began in 2001, when the Electric Power Industry Reform Act (EPIRA) was \napproved. With the impending shift to open access, measures are needed to ensure consumer \nbenefit and the effective regulation of the sector. Agreement was reached with officials in the \nDOE on the TA impact, outcome, outputs, cost estimates, and terms of reference.3 The design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Nine years after EPIRA passage, several objectives of the act have been achieved such \nas the unbundling of rates, removal of subsidies, and privatization of the transmission network \nthrough  a  management  concession  agreement  with  the  National  Grid  Corporation  of  the \nPhilippines. Wholesale electricity spot market operations since 2006 have resulted in wholesale \ncompetition in generation, the privatization of 91.8% of generation assets of the National Power \nCorporation as of April 2010, and the regulation of transmission and distribution by the Energy \nRegulatory Commission (ERC) since 2001. But much remains to be done to achieve the power \nsector reform objective of ensuring the sustainable supply of electricity at reasonable cost.   \n \n3.  Open access and retail competition would complete the institution of competition through \nthe entire cycle from generation to distribution. Only by implementing them can competitive \npressure on power-generating companies be realized, bringing efficiency to the sector and \nultimately reducing prices, the ultimate goal for consumers. \n \n4.  The government is set to implement open access, the next phase of reform of the \nPhilippine power sector, by October 2012.4 This will introduce a new dimension to the Philippine \nelectricity market, allowing consumers to select their electricity supplier. International experience \nshows that, with open access and consumers\u2019 general lack of understanding of reform issues, \nconsumer complaints are likely to increase, which will further burden the ERC, which handles \nconsumer complaints in addition to regulating the industry.  \n \n5.  The ERC was established to promote and protect long-term consumer interests in terms \nof the quality, reliability, and pricing of sustainable electricity supply by overseeing network \ninvestment, retail reforms, and effective competition. Although significant reforms have been \nimplemented since 2001, the sector still has high electricity prices and other problems, with \nconsumers absorbing the burden of high rates. Consumers have not yet benefited from reform \nin terms of lower electricity prices.5  The main competitive element\u2014open access\u2014has not yet \nbeen implemented. \n                                                \n1  Open access means that the utility\u2019s wires are open and can be used by consumers and generators to buy and sell \nelectricity from alternative sources, with payment to the utility of regulated transmission and distribution charges. \n2  Retail competition enables a customer to shop around for a cheaper source of electricity, switch directly to the \ncheaper alternative, and pay to the utility regulated transmission and distribution charges.  \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB website on 18 November 2011. \n4  Customers with an average monthly peak demand 1 MW in the 12 months preceding 26 December 2011 can \nchoose their electricity suppliers; Open Access will be gradually introduced to customers with lower consumption \nthresholds.   \n5  ADB. 2009.

Manila. \n ", "2 \n \n6.   The shift to open access should be accompanied by measures to ensure consumer \nprotection. EPIRA\u2019s objectives clearly include consumer protection, as does the ERC\u2019s mission. \nWith  open  access,  consumers  will  need  ready  access  to  information  on  tariffs,  clear \nunderstanding of the operation of the wholesale market, and any changes that may be proposed \nto  market  rules.  In  addition,  consumers  need  to  understand  the  market  structure,  the \ncompetitive forces that may drive price volatility. With the broad understanding of the market \ndynamics, a contestable customer\u2014customers who has right to shop for a supplier under the \nOpen Access regime\u2014will be able to decide on the price and quality of service package suitable \nto that customer\u2019s need.  \n \n7.  As gains from power sector reforms are measured in terms of consumer benefits, it is \nessential  to  ensure  that  competition  and  operational  efficiencies  translate  into  high-quality \nelectricity supply at reasonable rates. Consumers should be protected from imperfections in the \nelectricity industry and market. Consumer protection in the current system is under the ERC. The \ncurrent mechanism for handling consumer complaints in the electricity industry is inadequate.6 \nIn a deregulated environment that offers consumers more choices, the role of an ombudsman or \nan appointed official to receive and investigate complaints from individuals against electricity \ncompanies will be critical. Consumers\u2019 rights and obligations need to be clearly defined for \nprompt and effective dispute resolution. The staff responsible for receiving and investigating \ncomplaints must understand the rights and obligations of consumers in a deregulated industry \nand have the skills to resolve conflicts fairly. The ERC agrees with this view and will support \nestablishing an ombudsman in the energy sector. \n \n8.  Consumer  protection  is  an  energy  policy  priority  of  the  government,  which  has \nundertaken initiatives like improving energy self-sufficiency using cheaper indigenous energy \nresources to reduce dependence on imported oil, while avoiding increased generation cost. \nEnabling customers to choose electricity suppliers will make the power sector more efficient.  \n \n9.  In  parallel  with  government  strategies,  ADB\u2019s  current  country  partnership  strategy \nsupports  medium-term  policy  reforms  pertaining  to  power  distribution.7 It  has  consistently \nsupported the government\u2019s restructuring of the power sector, which started with the approval of \nthe $300 million Power Sector Restructuring Program on 16 December 1998.8 In December \n2002, ADB supplemented this loan with a partial credit guarantee to help finance additional \nadjustment  costs  associated  with  restructuring.9 Further,  the  Power  Sector  Development \nProgram was approved in December 2006.10 ADB has provided technical assistance grants to \nthe energy sector on tariff and pricing studies, regulation, and consumer impact assessment to \nsupport reform since 2001.     \n \n \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2002.

This TA is part of a sustained effort by ADB to assist the government in its continuing \nrestructuring of the power sector. The outcome will be to make consumers aware of open \naccess, electricity competition issues, and their rights and opportunities in the new electricity \nmarket. The impact will be an effective and efficient electricity market. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities  \n \n11.  The TA will be implemented through wide-range consultation with the government, the \nelectricity industry, and consumers and the adoption of international best practices. It will have \nthree components: (i) stakeholder capacity building, (ii) establishing a consumer consultation \ngroup, and (iii) establishing a dispute-resolution scheme for consumer complaints.  \n \n  1.  Stakeholder Capacity Building  \n   \n12.  Open access is a new concept for electricity consumers. Market competition in electricity \ngeneration has existed for years but is still unknown to most consumers. Other features of \npower  reforms  such  as  green  energy  options  and  net  metering  that  would  directly  affect \nconsumers will be implemented in the future. What these concepts are, how they work, their \nattributes, and how they affect prices are questions to which consumers should know the \nanswers.  Consumers  should  be  empowered  by  information  and  knowledge  on  what  open \naccess and electricity market competition provide. They should be made aware of their rights \nand opportunities under the new market set-up and apprised of developments in a timely way to \ninstill confidence and enable interacting in a new market environment.  \n \n13.  Likewise, the staff of government agencies in the energy sector, such as the DOE, ERC, \nPhilippine Electricity Market Corporation (PEMC), and National Electrification Administration, \nshould be prepared for the new market and its consequences for consumer protection. To equip \ngovernment  agencies  regarding  the  requirements  of  consumer  protection  and  empowering \nconsumers  in  a  new  market  arrangement,  this  TA  will  support  a  stakeholder  awareness \ncampaign comprising (i) an interactive website where all information pertaining to electricity will \nbe made available and consumers receive answers to their electricity-related questions; (ii) an \nadvocacy  campaign  including  training,  seminars,  workshops,  and  consultations  bringing \ntogether  government  staff,  consumers,  electricity  industry  players,  and  nongovernment \norganizations; and (iii) a consumer survey to establish baseline data on consumers. \n \n  2.  Establishing a Consumer Consultation Group  \n \n14.  Privatization and the introduction of competition accompanies the restructuring of the \nPhilippine electric power industry from a vertically integrated monopoly into a market in which \ngeneration, transmission, and distribution come under separate companies and utilities, with the \nadoption of a wholesale electricity market and, eventually, open access to it. Privatization \nnecessarily entails investment, and competition positions market players in ways that can adjust \nelectricity prices.  \n \n15.  The  ERC  regulates  electricity  transmission,  distribution,  and  retailing.  It  implements \nincentive-based regulation of power transmission and distribution, and there is open competition \nin generation, which is monitored and managed by the PEMC. While the ERC and the PEMC \n ", "4 \n \nconsult consumers on every decision, consumers have not exercised any reasonable influence \non the decision making of these entities. This leaves the regulator unaware of the consumer \nperspective on many of the issues that affect them. This TA will support the formation of a \nconsumer  consultative  group  of  members  representing  organizations  across  affected \njurisdictions. The members will consult with their constituencies from time to time on electricity \nissues that affect them, and the group will inform the government on these issues, enabling the \nregulator to understand conditions for consumers and strike a balance between consumers and \nregulated entities.  \n \n  3.  Dispute Resolution Scheme for Consumer Complaints  \n \n16.  Power  sector  reforms  have  been  implemented  toward  providing  consumers  more \nchoices on electricity use and provision. Open access, for instance, comes with a system that \nallows customers to change supplier after negotiating a contract with more favorable terms of \nprice and service. From the choice of the supplier to electricity delivery, its use, and payment for \nit, the consumer deals with the electricity supplier and distribution utility. Problems with bills \nresulting from switching, or related to electricity supply, such as power cuts and connection \nproblems, may arise between customers and these entities. To protect consumers and provide \na venue for resolving these conflicts, this TA will propose setting up an energy ombudsman that \nwill  receive  complaints,  investigate  them,  and  facilitate  their  resolution,  without  charge  to \nconsumers.   \n \n17.  The  government  considers  consumer  protection  a  priority.  Establishing  an  energy \nombudsman  would  require  an  enabling  law  or  government  order  to  change  current \narrangements,  under  which  consumer  protection  is  lodged  with  the  ERC.  Consumer \nempowerment should be accompanied by market monitoring to check whether consumers are \nbenefiting from competition in the electricity market or falling prey to possible market distortions. \nProtection mechanisms should both cater to consumer complaints and, by their existence, \nshield consumers from market abuses.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The  TA  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Republic  of  Korea  e-Asia  and \nKnowledge  Partnership  Fund  in  the  amount  of  $500,000  and  administered  by  ADB.  The \ngovernment will provide counterpart support in the form of office accommodation, transport, staff \nresources, and other in-kind contributions. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 2. \n   \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  The DOE will be the executing agency, working in collaboration with the ERC, PEMC, \nNational Electrification Administration, and other government agencies. The DOE will designate \na project coordinator during contract negotiations and counterpart staff that will work closely with \nconsultants during project implementation. ADB will, with the support of consultants, conduct \nworkshops, training, seminars, and consultations with stakeholders. Disbursements under the \nTA will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as \namended from time to time).  \n \n20.  The project will be implemented over 24 months from May 2012 to  April 2014. Individual \nconsultants  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Any procurement made will be carried out in ", "5 \n \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. The team of international consultants will \ninclude a consumer protection specialist and team leader (10 person-months) and an electricity \nmarket expert (5 person-months). The national consultants will be an advocacy specialist (7 \nperson-months) and a web developer (3 person-months). The consultant team will prepare an \ninception report within 4 weeks of the beginning of project implementation, an interim report at 5 \nmonths, a draft final report at 19 months, and a final report at 24 months. The implementation of \nstakeholder capacity building will be part of the interim report, and establishing the consumer \nconsultative group and the proposed design for a dispute-resolution scheme for consumer \ncomplaints will be included in the final report. The outline terms of reference for consultants are \nin Appendix 3. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n21.
