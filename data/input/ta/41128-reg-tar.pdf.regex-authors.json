This technical assistance (TA) supports the engagement of the Asian Development \nBank  (ADB)  in  the  urban  sector  in  Central  and  West  Asia.1 The  Central  and  West  Asia \nDepartment (CWRD) Social Sectors Division (CWSS) plans to carry out a series of country-\nlevel diagnostic studies in its priority sector, urban development, beginning with developing \nmember countries (DMCs) to be selected under this TA.2 The approach is to adopt a strategic \nplanning  methodology  for  a  structured,  rigorous,  and  fact-based  process  of  analysis  to \nunderstand problems and take strategic decisions. The studies will assess the urban sector at \nthe country level, identify key drivers, collect and interpret data, confirm trends and strategic \nshifts, review models, and put forward recommendations for ADB and its clients. The TA \noutput will be strategic urban assessments for three countries in Central and West Asia that \nbetter inform ADB operations. The TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  ADB\u2019s growing involvement in the urban sector\u2014as envisaged under the Medium-Term \nStrategy II (MTS II)3 and the Eminent Persons Group (EPG) report4\u2014calls for comprehensive, \nin-depth strategic sector work. This should break away from past approaches and examine \nsectors in a more strategic way, to provide definitive guidance on ADB\u2019s involvement in each of \nits DMCs. The inclusion of urban infrastructure as a core operational sector demands new \nthinking on modes of assistance in the urban sector, and the adoption of an integrated and \nholistic approach to the problems of urban areas and city regions. \n \n3.  The EPG report places ADB\u2019s future operations in the context of rapid economic growth \nand increasing urbanization in Asia. Trends indicate a major transformation of the region, with \nmost people living in urban areas by 2020. Countries will need to confront new risks and \nchallenges associated with this change, particularly if they want to remain competitive on the \nglobal market. These challenges include raising productivity and creating better paying jobs, \nmost of which will be in urban areas. This changing environment requires assistance to DMCs \nto  help  transform  traditional  institutions\u2014encouraging  adaptation  to  a  market-driven \nenvironment in which efficiency and transparency are essential. In a fast-changing region, the \nchallenges of urbanization are increasing and call for more innovative, flexible, and responsive \naction by DMCs and their development partners. \n \n4.  Over  the  next  20  years,  Asia\u2019s  cities  will  be  expected  to  accommodate  at  least \n1.2 billion more people, providing a compelling rationale for ADB\u2019s expanded engagement in \nthe sector. In Central and West Asia, the importance of developing urban infrastructure and \nservices remains high. The cities in Pakistan are characterized by haphazard growth, poor \nservice quality, traffic congestion, and inadequate institutional and financial arrangements and \nresources. Water supply and sewerage coverage ranges from 46% to 70%. Water quality is \npoor, and distribution networks are old and suffer from leakage and contamination. There is no \nreal sewage treatment in any urban area; most is dumped into the sea or rivers through open \nchannels,  creating  serious  environmental  problems.  Most  settlements  have  inadequate \ndrainage systems, resulting in flooding during the intense rainy season. Only 60% of solid \nwaste generated in Pakistani cities is collected; most is usually deposited on open ground or in \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 1 June 2007. \n2  Selection criteria will include size of urban sector and potential scope and timing of ADB assistance. \n3  ADB. 2006.

Manila.  \n \n ", "2   \npoorly designed dump sites on the outskirts of built-up areas. Movement of people within most \ncities is difficult because of the absence of effective public transport. A backlog of 6 million \nhousing  units  nationwide  has  resulted  in  overcrowding  within  the  existing  stock  and  the \nformation of many informal and illegal settlements with minimal basic amenities. Most cities do \nnot  have  strategic  development  plans  or  programs  to  support  cultural  heritage  and  the \nenvironment. \n \n5.  In Central Asia and the Southern Caucasus, many issues in urban areas have not been \ntackled effectively. Following independence, there has been a lack of maintenance for basic \ninfrastructure and increased stress placed on the current systems\u2014especially on water and \nwaste removal, housing, and transportation. A growing lack of safe water is one of the main \nproblems. Many urban areas have distribution networks but water is only supplied a few hours \neach  day.  Waste  removal  practices  are  also  questionable,  as  many  private  dwellers  and \nbusinesses resort to the use of roadside dumps and open urban spaces. Many cities of Central \nAsia continue to face a severe housing shortage. Others have experienced out-migration of \nproductive workers and are characterized by very high unemployment. Urban transportation is \nalso a major problem, compounded by high petrol prices and lack of electricity to run trams and \ntrolley buses. During winter, cities and towns often experience electricity and energy shortages, \nand people take desperate measures to keep warm. Lack of reliable energy and electricity also \nhinders foreign investment in the region, impeding economic progress. City planning still tends \nto follow the rigid and physical approach adopted under the former Soviet Union. \n \n6.  Urban centers are closely linked with economic growth throughout Central and West \nAsia, and therefore to broader improvements in quality of life. Policies tend to be based on \ntrend projections that lack supporting data in many cases. Little is known about the mandates, \nstructures, approaches, cost-effectiveness, and comparative advantages of service companies \noperating in the urban sector. The role of the private sector is not clearly defined or understood, \nand  opportunities  for  private  sector  partnerships  in  urban  infrastructure  development  and \nservice delivery remain limited. \n \n7.  As a first step towards improving the impact of ADB assistance to the urban sector in \nCentral and West Asia, several diagnostic analysis and strategic assessments are required. \nThese include the following: \n \n(i)  Clarifying the functions and financing of various levels of local government. \n(ii)  Increasing  cooperation  between  communities,  the  private  sector,  and  local \ngovernments.  \n(iii)  Improving coordination for urban planning and development. \n(iv)  Clarifying the role and capacity of regional and local administrations. \n(v)  Maintaining  economic  growth,  generating  employment,  and  improving  labor \nmarkets. \n(vi)  Improving the efficiency of service delivery, capturing economies of scale, and \nincreasing the role for private sector participation. \n(vii)  Encouraging better public transport and protecting the environment. \n(viii)  Enabling the provision of affordable housing for low-income and urban poor \ngroups. \n(ix)  Improving the efficiency and transparency of land markets. \n(x)  Raising sufficient financial resources for investment in urban infrastructure. \n \n8.  Towns and cities are now central to development in Central and West Asia. Innovative \nthinking is required to foster change, which is necessary to improve urban living conditions \nacross the region. In support of this, the TA will formulate a strategic assessment that sets out \n ", "  3\na clear and concise vision for future growth and development of urban settlements, together \nwith strategies and actions needed to achieve this. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  By improving the understanding of what drives change in the urban sector and designing \neffective  strategies  to  maximize  and  promote  sustainable  and  equitable  growth  of  urban \nsettlements,  the  TA  will  encourage  national  development  and  prosperity;  and  improve  the \nquality of life in towns and cities. The aim of the TA is to develop context-specific, appropriate \nsolutions that would have the highest likelihood of delivering measurable development results \nfor participating countries and ADB. The output will be highly accessible, quality knowledge \nproducts to help inform and influence key decision-makers on urban policy in the participating \nDMCs. The outputs will also improve knowledge and understanding of the urban sector for a \nbroader audience, and enable ADB to deliver its assistance more effectively and efficiently to \nthe urban sector. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA activities will include the following in each country: (i) a diagnostic analysis of the \nurban sector and the identification of key problem and theme areas; (ii) the preparation of a \nvision for the development of towns and cities, as well as establishing goals and objectives for \nkey problem or theme areas; (iii) a strategic road map for development of the urban sector; and \n(iv) a published knowledge product of high quality. \n \n11.  The TA will build on recent sector work undertaken in the selected DMCs. It will draw \non country strategies and programs, ongoing and proposed urban-related projects, as well as \ndocuments prepared by other development agencies and the private sector.5 CWSS will \nperform a detailed urban sector literature review prior to the TA to ensure that TA resources \nwill be focused on strategic planning and diagnostic activities. \n \n12.  The TA will look to the future, with an eye to developing a new approach for the analysis \nand interpretation of urban problems; and devise effective strategies and interventions to solve \nkey problems. The process will be streamlined and focused on a few key issues rather than a \ncomprehensive study of the sector. The findings of the analytical work will enhance ADB\u2019s \nsector knowledge, and its ability to engage effectively on policy dialogue with key stakeholders \nin the urban sector of its DMCs. Outputs will be highly \u201caccessible\u201d to DMC clients, civil society, \nand the private sector. The outputs will provide an entry point for partnerships with donors, civil \nsociety,  and  the  private  sector.  The  TA  should  contribute  to  improving  policy making  and \nforward  planning  of  national  and  provincial  governments,  and  within  the  major  cities  of \nparticipating countries.  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $1,000,000 equivalent, which will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The cost estimates and financing \nplan are in Appendix 2. \n                                                 \n5  As an example, recent sector work comprises largely sector-specific or project-specific analysis in each country, or \nsector assessments done on a provincial level in the case of Pakistan. The Government of Pakistan has prepared \nVision 2030 as well as a National Trade Corridor Policy. Building on Vision 2030, Pakistan is also preparing a \nnational spatial policy and strategy.   \n ", "4   \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA, with CWRD as the nodal point for TA \nactivities. ADB will administer the TA in close cooperation with the resident missions and host \ncountry governments. Collaboration with host country governments will involve leading urban \nresearch institutions and relevant government planning agencies. Formal no-objection letters \nwill be sought from the DMCs, and country-specific work under this TA will commence when \nreceived. The TA will be implemented over 10 calendar months, starting from March 2008 until \nthe end of December 2008. \n \n15.  The TA will be primarily implemented by a consulting firm to be recruited in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). A \ntotal of 51 person-months of consulting services will be provided for the TA. ADB\u2019s quality and \ncost-based selection method will apply for consulting firms, using the simplified technical \nproposal. About 16.5 person-months of international consultants will be required in the fields \nof  strategic  planning,  urban  economics,  and  change  management.  The  international \nconsultants will be expected to spend half of their time in the field, with the balance in their \nhome office. A total of 30 person-months of national sector analysts will be required in urban \neconomics/finance; infrastructure, service delivery, and environment management; housing, \nurban renewal and social aspects; and governance, institutions and capacity development. \nThese  international  and  national  consultants  will  be  required  to  be  associated  with  one \nanother in taking on this work. The TA will also draw on selected inputs totaling 4.5 person-\nmonths from three individually contracted urban sector advisors (one in each DMC) who will \nprovide high-level peer review and advice to the firm and to ADB. These advisors should be \nhighly regarded, locally based urban development specialists with extensive knowledge of \nurban issues.6 Two workshops will be held in each country to ensure the involvement of key \nstakeholders nationwide. The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. A \nwork program and staffing table is in Appendix 4. Equipment and office supplies to be financed \nby the TA will be procured by the consultants or ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time) or other procedures acceptable to ADB. Upon \ncompletion of the TA, the procured equipment will become the property of ADB. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis \nfor Developing Strategic Urban Assessments for selected Central and West Asia developing \nmember countries and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n6  These urban sector advisors may be international or national consultants, as conditions require. They should be \ndrawn from respected universities or research institutions within the DMCs, and will report to ADB staff. \n ", "  Appendix 1  5 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign Summary  Performance  Data Sources/  Assumptions and \nTargets/Indicators  Reporting  Risks \nMechanisms \n     \nImpact  \u2022 Budgeted annual  \u2022 Federal, provincial,  Assumption \nImproved service delivery in  development    and city government  \u2022 Increased level of \nurban sector   expenditure in    budgets  investment translates \nurban sector    into improved urban \nincreases over    services \nbaseline to be \ndetermined for each  Risk \nDMCa  \u2022 Economic growth \nleads to massive \nincreases in migration \nto urban areas, \nputting strain on \ndelivery of urban \nservices  \n \n     \nOutcome  \u2022 Local governments  \u2022 Federal, provincial,  Assumption \nImproved planning based on  prepare strategic  and city government  \u2022 All levels of \nunderstanding of drivers of  plans within the  plans  government and ADB \nurban change   context of the  \u2022 ADB documents  buy into the change \n  strategic urban  process \nassessments \nRisk \n\u2022 ADB country \nstrategies better  \u2022 Lack of political will to \nreflect priority needs  implement \nidentified for urban  appropriate change \nsector \n \n \n       \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.

General \n1.  This technical assistance (TA) will require inputs from international (16.5 person-months) \nand  national  (30  person-months)  consultants,  and  a  local  resource  person  from  each \nparticipating country. Expertise in strategic planning, economics (including tariff setting and \nregulatory reform), and change management will be required from the international consultants. \nThe national consultants will be sector specialists with innovative views on urban economics \nand finance; infrastructure, service delivery, and environment; social aspects, housing and \nurban renewal; and governance, institutions and capacity development. These consultants will \nwork under an international consulting firm, and will report to a strategic planning specialist who \nwill be the team leader. The TA country teams will also draw expert advice from 4.5 person-\nmonths  of  urban  sector  advisors,  who  will  be  well-respected  and  experienced  urban \ndevelopment  specialists  drawn  from  leading  academic  institutions  or  urban  research \norganizations in the participating country. \n \n2.  The consultants will carry out a diagnosis or problem analysis of the urban sector in the \nthree participating countries. Goals will be set at various levels, for key themes or functions. \nEnds and means will be discussed and related to one another. The work will be accompanied \nby efforts to obtain the buy-in, support, and commitment of key stakeholders. The process \nrequires identifying differences between the current and desired states for the sector, and \ndesigning actions to eliminate the differences. The Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) Central \nand West Asia Department (CWRD) Social Sectors Division (CWSS) will perform a literature \nreview prior to the fielding of consultants to ensure that TA time and resources are focused \nprimarily on diagnostic analysis and strategic planning. \n3.  The strategic urban assessment for the first participating country will be undertaken as a \npilot for the new approach. Drawing on lessons learned while preparing this document, the \nconsultants will undertake a similar exercise in the second and third participating countries. \n \nB.  Developing Strategic Urban Assessments \n4.  Drawing on existing publications, sector studies, reports, and available statistics and \ndata, the consultants will undertake a rapid assessment of the urban sector to determine key \nproblem areas and themes in each country. They will assess the status of urban development \nand determine what is likely to happen if no change takes place. With key stakeholders, the \nconsultants  will  develop  a  vision  for  each  country\u2019s  urban  future  and  determine  the  core \nstrategies needed to achieve this vision. The strategies will be supported with key actions to be \nundertaken to encourage necessary change. \n5.  For each country, the consultants will: \n(i)  Prepare a structured, fact-based, diagnostic analysis of the urban sector that will \nenable a better understanding of problems and lead to strategic decision making. \nThis will involve a diagnostic assessment of the urban sector; the identification of \nkey drivers; and collection, analysis and interpretation of data. It will outline \nurban trends, patterns, and strategic shifts over the past 10 or more years, and \ntheir implications for the country and the region. \n(ii)  Develop a vision of each country\u2019s urban future that is supported by government, \nthe private sector, representatives of key settlements, and civil society. \n ", " \nAppendix 3  9 \n \n(iii)  Determine what changes are needed to achieve the vision, and identify the \npossible role of international development assistance in this change process. \n(iv)  Propose an approach to evaluate the accomplishment of the strategic urban \nassessments. \n(v)  In  close  coordination  with  ADB,  manage  the  drafting,  publication  design, \ngraphics, editing, and printing of the strategic urban assessments publication for \neach  country  (estimated  to  be  100  pages  including  text,  graphics,  charts, \nphotographs, and other imagery). \n \n1.  Diagnostic Analysis\u2014Assessment and Baseline Information \n6.  The  team  of  consultants  will  assess  the  urban  sector  in  each  country,  gathering \nbaseline  information  and  describing  the  current  state  of  the  sector.  This  might  involve \nformulating logic trees, reducing problems to their essential components; forming and testing \nhypotheses; finding key drivers, and addressing problems through a collective approach that \nexamines the big picture; focusing on actual problems, gathering and interpreting data\u2014to \nidentify and confirm trends, patterns, and issues in the sector. \n7.  Specifically, for each country, the consultants will do the following: \n(i)  Map the spatial distribution of urban settlements. Prepare maps and graphics \nthat show the location of urban centers with major communication links (roads, \nrailways, airports) and physical features. This should clearly show the changing \nspatial distribution of settlements and the extent of urban expansion over the \npast 25 years. \n(ii)  Scan and collect appropriate and relevant data on the urban sector. This will not \nonly cover focused and time-bound statistics but also knowledge relating to the \nkey drivers of urban development\u2014the urban economy; transport, municipal \ninfrastructure  and  utilities,  and  the  environment;  housing  and  social \ninfrastructure; financing urban infrastructure and development; coordination and \nurban management; and institutional and human resource capacities. A review \nand assessment of urban service delivery companies operating in urban areas, \ntheir mandates, approaches, corporate structures, and relative efficiency and \neffectiveness, will be included. Data collection will include baseline data and \nforward indicators for monitoring the impact of the TA. \n(iii)  Design and compile a series of key indicators for a range of urban settlements. \nThis  should  be  expressed  numerically  and  graphically,  and  enable  a \ncomparison of today\u2019s values with those of 10 years ago. This would provide \nbenchmarks for towns and cities of various sizes, for comparison nationally and \ninternationally. The indicators should cover the economy; population, shelter, \nand social development; infrastructure, service delivery, and the environment \n(including transport); coordination, planning, and management; urban finance; \nand capacity. There should be a limited number of indicators (perhaps no more \nthan 25) but they should be designed to build a representative profile of each \nsettlement that clearly illustrates change over time. \n(iv)  Conduct urban sector situation analysis and problem formulation, and assess \nthe implications of trends and change in the key drivers of urban development. \nThis will describe what will happen if no change is undertaken. Key problem \nareas and themes within the sector and their causes will be identified. These \nthemes are likely to include: (a) appropriate enabling environments; (b) the \nchanging economic structure of towns and cities; (c) the problems of the urban\n ", "10  Appendix 3   \n \nfringe; (d) the incidence of slums, (e) the need for urban renewal and affordable \nhousing; (f) improving service delivery; (g) reducing energy use and carbon \ngeneration,  and  improving  the  physical  environment;  (h)  participatory  urban \nplanning  and  management  and  more  effective  coordination  of  urban \ndevelopment; (i) raising the necessary finance; (j) making urban governments \nmore effective, efficient, and responsive; and (k) promoting cultural diversity and \nheritage. This task will involve the identification of key markets and stakeholders, \nincluding  organizations  and  groups  (public,  private,  and  civil  society)  active \nwithin  the  sector  and  the  assessment  of  their  activities.  It  will  also  involve \nestablishing the major strengths and weakness of the urban system, along with \nkey opportunities and threats to the sector (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, \nand  threats  [SWOT]  analysis).  The  consultants  will  review  the  appropriate \nenabling environments, regulatory frameworks, structure of organizations, and \nincentive systems; and determine the resources and support needed to effect \nchange. Market incentives operating for each stakeholder will be assessed in \nrelation to the desired outcomes or end state\u2014the \u201cinstitutional model\u201d. The \nconsultants will compare the baseline/organization profile with the results of the \nSWOT analysis to determine gaps, which will form the basis for the long-term \nstrategic plan. The assessment and baseline situation (past, present, and future) \nwill end with the identification of the key areas where change is needed. \n \n2.  Desired End State \n8.  This represents where the developing member countries (DMCs) and ADB want to be; \nand requires setting a clear vision for the sector, within each country, with achievable goals, \nobjectives, and performance indicators that establish an end state\u2014indicating why change must \noccur. This would be supported by a long-term strategy, which identifies policy and program \nreforms  that  support  the  overall  goals  and  objectives.  Ideally,  this  would  determine  the \norganization(s) for change, as well as their desired structure, incentives, and required resources \nfor sustainable operation. This will also involve improving human resources and change in \norganizational culture, improving financial resources for investment, and facilitating an improved \nsociopolitical context. The process needs to be flexible. \n   \n9.  For each country, the key steps include the following: \n(i)  Through workshops and other consultations, develop a collective vision for the \nurban  sector  with  key  stakeholders  from  national,  provincial,  and  local \ngovernments, academe, private sector, and civil society. Two workshops will be \norganized and conducted in each country, one in the capital and the other in a \nmajor secondary center. \n(ii)  Establish and agree clear values for the urban sector and guiding principles for \nsector development to provide the underlying framework for decision making. \n(iii)  Identify achievable goals for the key theme or problem areas identified earlier. \nObjectives will then be established to support the attainment of each goal. \n \n3.  Road Map \n10.  A road map will detail what needs to be done to achieve the vision. Strategies, action \nplans to implement the strategies, and performance measures will be developed. Specifically, \nthe consultants, for each country, will do the following: \n ", "Appendix 3  11 \n(i)  Develop major strategies necessary to encourage change and attain the vision or \nend state, and identify key actions and priority interventions needed in the short \nand long term. This might relate to capacity building, institutional development \nand legislative reform necessary to create appropriate enabling environments; \neffective markets and instruments to encourage economic development, urban \nrenewal,  and  housing;  to  ensure  better  utility  and  service  delivery;  and  to \nencourage environmental improvements, as well as attracting more private and \npublic financial resources into the sector. \n(ii)  Provide indicative estimates of the overall investment requirements necessary to \nachieve the established goals and the vision. Assess the likely availability of \nthese resources and broadly identify the financing gap. \n(iii)  Identify key interventions and priority projects on the basis of likely resource \navailability and the degree to which they satisfy the goals and objectives that \nsupport the attainment of the vision. These should be high profile interventions \nthat will make a difference. Others can also be recommended for inclusion if the \nresource envelope is enlarged. \n(iv)  Determine priority interventions and investment prospects for external assistance, \nfocusing on the potential future role of ADB. This should explore ADB\u2019s role as a \nknowledge provider, as well as a lender. \n(v)  Prepare a draft report after 3 months; and discuss and agree on the strategies, \npriority projects, and interventions with each government and ADB. \n \n4.  Assessing Performance, Evaluation, and Feedback Continuing Change \n11.  The consultants will complete the technical work by establishing an appropriate system \nfor assessing how the urban sector is performing against the vision, and how each theme is \nperforming against its goal and objectives\u2014i.e., how the country and its development partners \nare performing to effect change in the urban sector. It also should cover the identification of any \ncorrective actions necessary. \n12.    For each country, this will involve the following: \n \n(i)  Developing sector performance measures, based on the key indicators and \nthemes identified earlier. \n(ii)  Assessing  the  use  of  the  balanced  scorecard  framework,  which  views  the \nsector  from  four  perspectives\u2014learning  and  growth  (capacity),  urban \ndevelopment processes, stakeholder satisfaction, and financial resources. \n(iii)  Providing an approach and criteria that would enable the identification of when \ncorrective actions are needed and when the assessment should be revised. \n \n5.  Publication Design and Printing \n 13.  The consultants will hire an urban specialist editor to edit the drafts of the three \nstrategic urban assessment documents for consistency, structure, content, format, and style. \nIn consultation with ADB, appropriate graphics, a publication design, and layout firm will be \nhired to do the following: \n(i)  Prepare the three publications, which will be in the form of readily accessible, \neasy-to-understand documents that provide useful data and analysis in graphic \nand written formats. \n ", " 12  Appendix 3 \n(ii)  Manage the drafting of the strategic urban assessments for the three participating \ncountries  in  close  coordination  with  ADB  and  in  line  with  ADB  publication \nguidelines. \n(iii)  Oversee and manage the publications\u2019 design; graphics (maps, satellite imagery, \ncharts, tables, and other graphics [including cover design]); editing; translation \n(as necessary); and printing (estimated at 100 pages, including text, graphics, \ncharts, photographs, and other imagery). \n ", "  \n \n \nWORK PROGRAM AND STAFFING SCHEDULE\nMonths\nCountry/Staffing/Task\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\nA.
