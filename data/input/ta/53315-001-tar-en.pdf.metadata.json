The proposed Power Sector Development Program will intensify the implementation of \non-going reforms and improve the financial sustainability of the power subsector in Tajikistan. The \ncountry\u2019s single vertically integrated power utility, Joint Stock Holding Company Barqi Tojik, faces \nissue of unsustainable liabilities, weak regulations and inadequate tariffs, corporate governance \nand inadequate metering infrastructure. The program aims to achieve the outcome of improved \npower sector financial sustainability with five outputs: (i) power subsector governance structure \nstrengthened (ii) financial management of power utilities improved (iii) sustainable corporate \nmanagement introduced in the new distribution company (iv) subsector\u2019s reform and operational \ncapacity strengthened including women\u2019s increased participation in the power subsector, and \n(v) retail billing and collection system modernized. Of the program\u2019s estimated cost of $145 \nmillion, ADB will fund $105 million. The program is included in the Country Operations Business \nPlan, 2020\u20132022.1 \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SUBPROJECT \n \nA.  Overall Progress of the Technical Assistance Cluster \n \n2.   The cluster transaction technical assistance was approved in March 2020. Subproject 1 \nis  ongoing,  and  the  consultants  to  support  gender  mainstreaming  in  project  design, \nimplementation and monitoring have been engaged. This Subproject 4 is the second subproject \nto be implemented from 2020.  \n \nB.  Subproject Scope \n \n3.   The subproject will strengthen gender mainstreaming of the proposed program to meet \neffective gender mainstreaming categorization. Specifically, the subproject will address the limited \nemployment of women in technical occupations in the power subsector, which is predominantly \ncomposed of male workers. In 2018, the main office of the Joint Stock Holding Company Barqi \nTojik had a total of 2,350 engineers of which only 283 (or 12%) were females. As Barqi Tojik is \nunbundled into generation, transmission and distribution companies, the subproject will aim to \nincrease the pool of potential women technical workers for the power subsector, by supporting \nfemale graduating students and female graduates of courses related to science, technology, \nengineering, and mathematics (STEM) to undergo technical trainings and underdo on-the-job \ntrainings in the power companies.  \n  \nC.

In 2018, the main office of the Joint \nStock Holding Company Barqi Tojik (BT) had a total of 11,074 employees, of which 1309 (12%) \nwere women. However, these women employees were mostly in non-technical positions. Of the \ntotal 2350 engineers of BT, only 283 (or 12%) were females. Most technical staff of the BT \ngraduated from the following: (i) Technical University of Dushanbe, (ii) Bokhtar Energy Institute, \n(iii) Polytechnic College, (iv) Construction College of Dushanbe in Bokhtar, and (v) a branch of \nthe Moscow Institute of Energetics. The proportion of females enrolling in these institutions are \nsmall. During the schoolyear of 2018\u20132019, the energy faculty of the Technical University had \n169 females enrolled out of a total 3982 students (or 4%), while the secondary vocational faculty \nin energy enrolled 151 females out of a total of 1769 students (or 9%). The stereotype that the \nenergy sector is a man\u2019s domain, is still prevalent. Having girls enrolled in the energy faculties of \ntechnical institutes and universities is still a novelty.  \n \nThe subproject will contribute to increasing the number of female students being trained in energy-\nrelated professions and expand the pool of potential women technical workers for the power \nsector. The subproject will specifically support female graduating students and female graduates \nof courses related to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) to undergo \ntechnical trainings for specific skills required in the power sector, and undergo on-the-job trainings \nin the power companies. \n \nScope of Services: \n \nThe subproject aims to contribute to the long-term goal of increasing the pool of qualified female \nworkers trained in technical professions for the power sector.
