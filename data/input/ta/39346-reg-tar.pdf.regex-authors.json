Given  the  rapidly  changing  social,  economic  and  institutional  circumstances  of  its \ndeveloping member countries (DMCs), the Asian Development Bank (ADB) needs to ensure \nthat it remains relevant and responsive to the DMCs in its policies, operations, and institutional \nstructures. The ADB needs to draw on knowledge and lessons of experience across the globe \nto remain current in its development approaches. The establishment of external forums\u2014at \nwhich  distinguished  experts  in  ADB\u2019s  priority  sectors  and  thematic  areas  can  gather  to \nexchange ideas and provide directions\u2014is a valuable way for the institution to improve its \ndevelopment effectiveness.  \n \n2.  The  scope  and  direction  of  the  proposed  ADB  technical  assistance  (TA)  grant  for \nExternal Forums for Selected Sector and Thematic Priorities at the Asian Development Bank \nwere defined in the concept paper approved by ADB\u2019s Management on 16 June 2005. The TA \nis  included  as  a  firm  activity  in  the  work  program  of  ADB\u2019s  Regional  and  Sustainable \nDevelopment  Department  (RSDD).1 The  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  presented  in \nAppendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Given the region\u2019s very rapid and accelerating transformation, ADB\u2019s medium- and long-\nterm strategies need to respond flexibly and creatively. The challenge is to improve ADB\u2019s \ndevelopment effectiveness with relevance and adaptability. There have been several recent \ninitiatives to harmonize practices and procedures, improve business processes, and develop \nnew  financial  products.  These  have  been  accompanied  by  a  renewed  focus  on  regional \ncooperation and integration.  \n \n4.  The need for ADB to draw on lessons and experiences of current international thinking \nwas recognized in the establishment of the External Forum on Gender (EFG). The EFG is \nADB\u2019s  first  standing  advisory  group  on  a  thematic  priority,  and  is  one  of  the  institutional \nmechanisms under the Gender and Development Policy2 to facilitate regular dialogue between \nADB  and  key  gender  experts  from  governments,  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs), \nacademia, and other segments of civil society. The EFG has played an important role in (i) \nraising the profile of gender issues within ADB, (ii) sharing knowledge and experience on \nregional gender concerns relevant to ADB operations, and (iii) providing independent feedback \nand guidance on ADB performance under the Gender and Development Policy. For 2006, ADB \nwill continue its support for the EFG under an ongoing TA.3  \n \n5.  With the success of the EFG, RSDD plans to replicate the model and apply it to ADB\u2019s \nother cross-cutting and thematic priorities. This will occur on a trial basis in two phases, the first \nduring 2006, and the second during 2007\u20132009. The themes have been drawn from those most \nrelevant to ADB\u2019s emerging challenges and within the context of ADB\u2019s strategic interventions \nfor the second Medium-Term Strategy and the directions of ADB\u2019s Reform Agenda.4 RSDD has \nidentified  six  operationally  relevant  areas  for  2006  that  could  benefit  from  guidance  by \ninternationally  recognized  practitioners  and  policy  makers:  clean  energy,  environmental \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 31 March 2006. \n2  ADB. 2003.

Exploiting Clean Energy. Energy use in Asia and the Pacific is characterized by rapid \ngrowth and the dominant use of fossil fuels. In 2003, the total primary energy supply for Asia \nwas 2.6 billion tons of oil equivalent, representing 25% of the world\u2019s total energy supply. Ten \nyears earlier, Asia\u2019s total primary energy supply was only 13.3% of the world\u2019s total. This trend \nis neither economically nor environmentally sustainable. ADB's Energy Policy5 emphasizes the \nneed to accelerate widespread adoption of renewable energy and energy efficiency in its DMCs. \nThis focus has been further strengthened in the ADB Energy Policy Review,6 which shifted the \nemphasis  toward  renewable  energy  and  energy  efficiency  project  preparation  and  policy \nreforms through specific priorities, such as promoting private sector involvement and addressing \nregional and global environmental impacts in energy sector operations. ADB now has several \ninitiatives intended to assess and strengthen the effectiveness of energy sector interventions.7 \nGiven that many DMCs currently face major energy security issues, especially with high energy \nprices and increased competition for supply, it is opportune for ADB to explore innovative \napproaches to assist DMCs exploit clean energy options and develop policy instruments such \nas taxes and market-based incentives. \n \n7.  Investing in the Environment. The theme of the 2005 Asian Environment Outlook8 is \nthat all those involved in development\u2014governments, civil society, and business interests\u2014\nshould come together in creating a sustainable future with innovation and creativity. The Asian \nEnvironment  Outlook  points  out  that  there  are  considerable  business  opportunities  in  the \nprovision of (i) environmental infrastructure, such as water supply and wastewater systems, (ii) \nrenewable energy, (iii) environmentally preferable products, (iv) environmentally sound primary \nproduction, and (v) environmental services, including design, engineering, laboratory analysis, \nmonitoring, auditing and reporting. The global market for environmental goods and services has \nbeen estimated at about $600 billion, and is likely to increase to over $830 billion by 2015. While \nthe  majority  of  the  revenue  is  still  generated  in  western  countries  and  Japan,  intense \ncompetition in those countries, combined with increasing customer sophistication, decelerating \ngrowth and reduced profitability means that sizable new market opportunities are located in the \ndeveloping  world,  primarily  the  Asia  and  Pacific  region.9 The  potential  for  enhancing  the \neffectiveness of ADB\u2019s catalytic role in exploiting those opportunities through private sector \npartnerships is an area of significant contemporary importance. \n \n8.  Coping  with  Health  Emergencies.  Recent  history  has  shown  the  significant \nhumanitarian, social, political, and economic implications of new and emerging communicable \ndiseases.  According  to  the  World  Health  Organization,  more  than  30  new  diseases  have \nemerged since the mid-1970s, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), HIV/AIDS, \nand avian influenza. SARS emerged in the southern People\u2019s Republic of China in late 2002 \nand  spread  quickly  across  Asia  and  North  America,  with  cases  eventually  reported  in  32 \ncountries and areas. By the end of 2004, almost 8,500 cases and more than 900 deaths had \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 1995. The Bank\u2019s Policy Initiatives for the Energy Sector.

Manila [approved on 19 December]). \n ", "  3\nbeen reported. Estimates of the global cost of SARS have varied from $30 billion\u2013150 billion; \nthe cost in East Asia is estimated at about $18 billion, representing 0.6% of gross domestic \nproduct.10 \n \n9.  Avian influenza (H5N1) was first detected in humans in late 2003, about a year after \nSARS, and has generated major concern about a new global pandemic. The implications of an \ninfluenza pandemic in Asia are enormous. ADB estimates that an outbreak of avian influenza \ncould cost $99 billion under a short-term impact scenario, and over $280 billion in a long-term \nimpact scenario.11 HIV/AIDS is a continuing global epidemic that is spreading rapidly in the \nregion. The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) estimates that 40.3 million \npeople were affected globally at the end of 2005, with 8.3 million people living with HIV in Asia,12 \nincluding 2.1 million women. There were 4.9 million newly infected people in this region in 2005, \nand 3.1 million adults and children died due to AIDS.13 The effects and implications of emerging \ndiseases, together with the public health challenges of more frequent natural catastrophes \ncaused by climate change, make it imperative that globally coordinated programs are discussed, \ndeveloped and implemented, especially for the Asia and Pacific region, where ADB has played \na major role in tackling those diseases through awareness and capacity building. \n \n10.  Knowledge  Management  for  Development\u2013Asia.  In fighting poverty, development \npractitioners have recognized the critical role of information in being able to \u201cimprove incomes \nand living standards at a much faster pace than previously imagined\u201d14 and the need for the \ndevelopment community to \u201ctake on new tasks related to the creation, transfer and management \nof  knowledge\u201d.15 This  recognition  has  led  to  the  widespread  adoption  of  knowledge-based \nstrategies by those active in the development sector, including aid agencies, NGOs and other \ncivil  society  organizations,  and  research  institutes.  Various  organizations  have  launched \nknowledge sharing initiatives with interconnected goals: improving internal knowledge sharing; \nsharing knowledge with and learning from partners and clients; and building the capacity of \nclients to more effectively access, adapt, and apply knowledge to local conditions. To continue \nprogress in knowledge management, practitioners in development organizations in the region \nneed  to  (i)  share  experiences  in  implementing  and  applying  knowledge  management  and \nlearning  approaches;  (ii)  better  understand  how  private  and  public  sector  organizations \napproach knowledge sharing and learning; (iii) deepen leadership and management roles; (iv) \npresent new information and communication technology tools and techniques for knowledge \nsharing;  (v)    share  experiences  in  managing  communities  of  practice;  and  (vi)  discuss \nknowledge management assessment methodologies for development organizations. \n \n11.   Governance Initiatives\u2013Adapting the Role of Government in the Transition to a \nMarket Economy. Developing sound governance principles has been one of the top issues for \ngovernments as they implement policies and introduce reforms in the move to market-led \neconomies. Economic growth alone will not solve the problems of social exclusion and poverty. \nDespite  considerable  achievements  in  liberalization  and  privatization  during  the  transition \n                                                 \n10 Fan, E. 2003.

In addition, the transition of ownership and the changing role of the state requires \nsound processes for building new institutions and governance mechanisms. Adequate checks \nand balances are needed for market-led economies to grow and flourish. Some of the key \nissues that need to be explored for DMCs include: (i) measures to constrain state capture, (ii) \nthe extent to which enforcement is the key to creating an effective business environment, (iii) \npolitical factors that shape development outcomes and the extent to which analysis of the \npolitical  economy  improves  development  effectiveness,  and  (iv)  lessons  learned  and  good \npractices in establishing sound governance principles as governments move to  market-led \neconomies.   \n \n12.  Promoting  Private  Sector  Participation  in  Urban  Water.  ADB  will  significantly \nincrease water investments between 2006 and 2010, making water a core area of its operations \nunder ADB\u2019s second Medium-Term Strategy.17 Private sector participation (PSP) in the urban \nwater sector has been generally confined to private companies (i) tendering for construction \ncontracts, (ii) selling meters to utilities, and (iii) providing, in the informal sector, water vending in \nareas lacking network connections. The past several years have ushered in a greater role for \nPSP in infrastructure development in Asia, including in the water sector. Across the region, \ngovernments are beginning to look more closely at various PSP models, weighing advantages \nand disadvantages, and learning from Asia's experiences with those models. Three models are \nmost  relevant  to  ADB\u2019s  work:  management  contracts,  build-operate-transfer  projects,  and \nconcessions. Asia's experience with PSP in water and sanitation offers mixed results, often \nbecause the arrangements depend on having an optimal balance between an equitable tariff \nstructure, a credible regulator, and involvement of community groups and users. ADB does not \nsupport water privatization, but advocates improved efficiency in the delivery of sustainable \nwater services, through various reforms, including through increased PSP.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The  TA  will  support  ADB  in  conducting  external  forums  to  exchange  views  on \ndevelopment issues in selected sector and/or thematic areas, in order to provide feedback and \nguidance to ADB regarding (i) its strategic planning processes, (ii) the implementation of its \ndevelopment objectives, and (iii) improvement of its development effectiveness. Under the TA, \nwhich will be the first phase of a continuing series, an external forum will be set up for each of \nthe sector and thematic priorities identified for 2006: clean energy, environmental investments, \nknowledge management, health emergencies, governance, and PSP in the water sector. The \nTA  will  be  used  to  provide  opportunities  to  draw  upon  the  knowledge  of  internationally \nrecognized experts and practitioners in these fields, in order to create greater understanding of \n                                                 \n16It was generally believed that the disposal of state assets through privatization programs would create the \nfoundation for improved governance. However, a business environment and enterprise performance survey, \nconducted in 20 countries, showed that the initial hope that privatization would create the foundation for improved \ngovernance, and transform the ties between the state and the private sector, had not been fully realized.

The \nfocus of the program will be on combining increased investments in water infrastructure with capacity building and \nprivate sector participation. \n ", "  5\nhow ADB can contribute to development in Asia within the context of its policies and operations. \nThe  outcomes  of  the  forums  will  provide  direction  to  ADB\u2019s  Management,  staff  and  DMC \nstakeholders in improving the development effectiveness of ADB operations.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The TA provides the overall framework for key activities under each forum, which will \ninclude (i) preparing technical papers by internationally recognized experts in each selected field \nthat explore the current state of knowledge and developing country applications for each sector \nor theme, including innovative approaches, best practices and lessons learned; (ii) conducting \nforums at ADB headquarters at which approaches will be presented to and debated by sector \nand/or thematic specialists from across the region and ADB staff; and (iii) recommendations by \nforum members to ADB on future directions in the sectors and/or thematic areas, and actions \nthat should be taken by ADB in order to maintain its relevance, leadership and role as the \npremier development institution in Asia and the Pacific.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $400,000. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program.  Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are given \nin Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA, with the Office of the Director General \nRSDD (RSOD) responsible for the overall implementation of the TA, and each RSDD division \nconcerned responsible for carrying out day-to-day activities for individual forums. The TA is \nexpected to start in July 2006 and be completed by December 2006.  \n \n17.  The RSDD divisions responsible for the themes18 will submit requests to RSOD for \ndrawdowns on TA funds when they initiate each activity. The requests will set out details of \nindividual  forums,  identify  specific  costs  associated  with  each  forum,  and  liquidate  all \nexpenditures  in  accordance  with  customary  ADB  requirements.  The  divisions  may  request \nsupport to engage facilitators for individual forums, and resource persons who may contribute to \nthe discussions at each forum. General terms of reference for the forums are given in Appendix \n2. All consultants will be engaged on an individual basis in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants. The expertise and duration of assignments of any consultants will be \ndetermined by the RSDD Division in setting out the structure of each forum. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n18.
