The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has assisted the Government of Mongolia (the \nGovernment) in restructuring its education system since 1994. The Mongolia country strategy and \nprogram update 2007\u20132009 includes the Education Sector Reform Project (the Project) in 2009.1 \nDuring the country programming review in December 2006, the Government and ADB agreed to \nadvance the Project from 2009 to 2008.2 A project preparatory technical assistance (TA) was \nincluded in the ADB assistance program for 2007 to help the Government prepare the Project. In \nApril 2007, ADB fielded the Fact-Finding Mission for the TA, which reached agreement with the \nGovernment on the impact, outcome, outputs, methodology and key activities, implementation \narrangements,  cost  estimates,  financing  plan,  and  outline  terms  of  reference  for  consulting \nservices of the TA. The design and monitoring framework of the TA is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Education is a high priority in Mongolia. After encountering difficulties during the initial \neconomic transition in the 1990s, Mongolia has made significant progress in developing the \neducation  sector.  In  2004,  the  gross  enrollment  rate  was  97%  for  primary  and  secondary \neducation, and the adult literacy rate was 97%. This, along with the small disparity between the \nfemale and male enrollment ratios, indicates that Mongolia is on track to achieve the education-\nrelated Millennium Development Goals. Annual public expenditure on education is high at 8\u20139% \nof gross domestic product (GDP). The Government adopted the Education Sector Master Plan \n2006\u20132015  in  2006.  The  master  plan  spells  out  the  vision,  policy  goals  and  objectives, \nimplementing  strategies  (including  institutional  mechanisms),  and  estimated  resources  for \nimplementing sector reform over the next decade. According to the revised Education Law, \nenacted in January 2007, the transition to a 12-year public education system will begin in the \n2008\u20132009 school year. \n \n3.  ADB has been a close partner in supporting education sector reform and development in \nMongolia since the mid-1990s. The Education Sector Development Program (ESDP),3 approved \nin 1996, provided integrated policy and investment support to (i) improve the sector\u2019s financial \nsustainability through staffing rationalization, cost sharing for textbook printing and distribution, \nprivatization of state universities, and private sector involvement in vocational education and \ntraining, and higher education; and (ii) provide initial rehabilitation of selected school buildings in \nvery poor condition. ESDP was completed successfully in 2002. To build on its achievements, \nADB approved the Second Education Development Project (SEDP) in 2002.4 Cofinanced by the \nNordic Development Fund, SEDP focuses on (i) rehabilitating schools in critical physical condition, \n(ii)  providing  instructional  materials,  and  (iii)  building  capacity  of  schoolteachers  and \nadministrators. SEDP is due to be completed in 2008. The Third Education Development Project \n(TEDP), which began implementation in March 2007,5 will complement ESDP and SEDP by (i) \nrevising the curriculum framework, education standards, accreditation system for pre-service \nteacher training, and certification system for in-service teacher training for the new 12-year school \nsystem;  (ii)  improving  the  learning  environment,  including  rehabilitating  schools;  and  (iii) \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006.

Despite these significant achievements, the education sector faces some new constraints \nand priorities, including (i) further improving access to and quality of basic education (primary and \nsecondary),  (ii)  further  enhancing  sector  efficiency  and  effectiveness,  and  (iii)  reforming  the \nhigher education subsector.  \n \n5.  Access and Quality of Basic Education. The initial major efforts of the Government and \nADB (para. 3) to address quality and access issues focused on rehabilitating schools in critical \nphysical condition. More recently, rural-urban migration and the ongoing transition from a 10-year \nto an 11-year school system\u2014with plans for a 12-year school system beginning in 2008\u2014have \nbrought a new range of concerns regarding access to and quality of basic education.  \n \n6.  The continued rural-urban migration has caused increased crowding in urban schools. To \naccommodate rising enrollments, many schools that already were running in two shifts have had \nto increase class size to 50\u201360 students\u2014far above the upper limit of 35 students per class set \nby the Education Law. Some schools operate in three shifts. Schools in rural areas where out-\nmigration has occurred face difficulties in maintaining school operations due to shrinking budgets \nand departing teachers. Under the ongoing transition to an 11-year school system, and further \ntransition to a 12-year school system beginning in 2008, children will start schooling at 6 years old \ninstead of 8. In addition to creating pedagogical issues, this will increase demand for school \nbuildings (including dormitories), facilities, and equipment to address higher overall enrollments, \nas well as to ensure an appropriate learning environment for children at such a young age. In \nmany schools, laboratory equipment and other teaching and learning materials are outdated, in \npoor condition, or in short supply. The expected rise in enrollment will increase demand for such \nequipment and materials. This situation suggests an urgent need for a systematic assessment of \nthese expanding priorities, and the development of coping strategies and implementation plans. \n \n7.  The quality of education depends on the quality of teachers, particularly on the pre-service \nteacher training that is carried out mainly in the country\u2019s five state-owned teacher training \ncolleges (TTC). Systematic improvement in the quality of pre-service teacher training is urgently \nneeded, including (i) improving the quality of the teaching staff in the TTCs; (ii) improving the \nteaching  and  learning  conditions  at  the  TTCs,  including  buildings,  facilities,  materials,  and \nequipment; (iii) strengthening TTC financing, as these state-owned institutions receive no budget \nallocation from the Government and rely solely on tuition fees; and (iv) strengthening TTCs into \nstrong support centers for in-service teacher training and development. With the accreditation \nsystem to be established under TEDP (para. 3), further strengthening of pre-service teacher \ntraining will complement Government and development partners\u2019 efforts, which have focused on \nimproving in-service teacher training. \n \n8.  Sector Efficiency and Effectiveness. While continuing to allocate 8\u20139% of GDP to the \neducation sector, the Government has paid increasing policy attention to improving the efficiency \n(how  efficiently  resources  are  used)  and  enhancing  the  effectiveness  (how  resources  are \ntranslated into education attainment and outcomes). Enhanced efficiency and effectiveness will \nstrengthen the sector\u2019s sustainability and resilience to unanticipated fiscal and financial difficulties \ndue to commodity price swings and other external shocks to the economy.  \n \n9.  Key  measures  include  improvements  in  budgeting,  as  well  as  financial  and  human \nresource management. Budget allocations to schools for operations and maintenance should be \nincreased to reduce premature wear and tear of school buildings and facilities. The use of \n ", "  3\ninnovative  technologies  in  renewable  energy,  thermal  insulation,  and  water  treatment  and \nsanitation offers significant potential for reducing heating costs, which account for about 18% of \nthe average school budget (more than 20% for rural and smaller schools), and increasing the \noperational  efficiency  of  schools.  To  provide  proper  incentives,  schools  must  be  given  the \nfinancial management flexibility to keep budget savings derived from adopting these measures. \nSimilarly, the Government can strengthen its ongoing effort to streamline teachers\u2019 compensation \nand provide incentives for teachers in remote and rural areas, and to multi-grade and multi-\nsubject teaching. \n \n10.  Integrating information and communications technology (ICT) into education is a priority of \nthe education master plan. However, ICT integration into education in an educationally effective \nand financially sustainable manner will have major financial costs for hardware, software, and \noperations and maintenance, straining the entire education system Thus, the development of a \nstrategy to guide ICT integration is urgently needed. Since 2004, parents have been responsible \nfor textbook purchases. International best practice has demonstrated repeatedly that a well-\ndesigned and managed textbook rental scheme can ease the burden of education costs on \nstudents  and  parents,  especially  on  poor  families,  and  stimulate  the  development  of  other \nteaching and learning materials and textbooks. This will build on ESDP\u2019s support for textbook \nprinting and distribution to enhance textbook and learning materials provision and development \nwith a pro-poor focus.   \n \n11.  Higher  Education  Reform.  Mongolia  has  about  150  higher  education  institutions, \nincluding state-owned establishments and many relatively new private institutions. For a country \nwith a population of about 2.5 million, this is a high number that indicates inefficiency and the \nneed for subsector rationalization. The subsector lacks a proper policy and regulatory framework, \ndefining  clearly  (i)  the  respective  roles  of  public  and  private  institutions;  (ii)  the  subsector \nmanagement  structure,  including  the  degree  of  autonomy  of  public  institutions;  (iii)  the \nresponsibility  and  accountability  of  higher  education  institutions;  and  (iv)  sustainable  sector \nfinancing. Such a policy and regulatory framework will be needed to guide rationalization and \nother measures to improve sector management and performance systematically, including (i) \ncurriculum  and  materials  development,  (ii)  quality  of  teaching  staff,  (iii)  testing  and  quality \nstandards, and (iv) other teaching and learning conditions.  \n \n12.  Government  Strategy  and  Support  from  Development  Partners.  The  education \nmaster  plan  provides  a  foundation  for  all  reform  and  development  activities  in  the  sector \nsupported by the Government and its development partners, including ADB. Established in 2005, \nthe Education Donors\u2019 Consultative Mechanism (EDCM), which the Ministry of Education, Culture \nand Science (MECS) chairs, provides an effective mechanism to guide the partnership between \nthe Government and its development partners. As testimony to the success of this partnership, \nMongolia gained access in 2006 to grant resources from  Education for All-Fast-Track Initiative. \nADB is a lead development partner in the education sector and, on behalf of development \npartners, co-chairs EDCM with Japan, which provides the largest amount of support to the sector. \nADB is providing TA for planning and developing a sector-wide approach in the education sector. \nWorld Bank has conducted several analytical studies on education, which the ADB TA will build \non. World Bank\u2019s ongoing Rural Education and Development Project supports the school cluster \ndevelopment  to  strengthen  sector  management  at  school  levels.  ADB  coordinates  and \ncollaborates  closely  with  all  development  partners  in  the  sector  through  EDCM,  which  will \ncontribute to the effective implementation of the TA.  \n \n ", "4   \nIII.  THE  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The impact of the TA will be improved access, quality, efficiency, and effectiveness of the \neducation  sector.  The  outcome  of  the  TA  will  be  a  design,  agreed  on  by  ADB  and  the \nGovernment,  for  an  investment  project  suitable  for  ADB  support.  The  TA  output  will  be  a \nfeasibility study for a project prepared in accordance with Government policies and priorities in \nthe education sector, as well as ADB policies, guidelines, and procedures.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The TA will follow a participatory approach. Key stakeholders will be consulted frequently \non TA findings to build consensus on important sector issues and make recommendations on the \nproject design. EDCM, among others, will serve as an important forum and platform for such \nconsultation. The main TA activities and methodologies are discussed in paras. 15-17. \n \n15.  Review of Key Sector Issues. Regarding access and quality of basic education, the TA \nwill review and assess (i) rural-urban migration and its impact on crowded urban schools and \nrural schools, (ii) the impact of the transition to a 12-year education system, and (iii) the quality of \npre-service teacher training. For sector efficiency and effectiveness, the analysis will review (i) \nbudget,  financial,  and  human  resource  management;  and  (ii)  innovative  energy  efficiency \n(renewable energy, thermal insulation) and other efficiency-enhancing technologies, building on \nongoing work by other development partners. In addition, the TA will (i) develop an educationally \neffective and financially sustainable strategy for integrating ICT into basic education; and (ii) \nreview effective ways of providing textbooks, including the feasibility of establishing a textbook \nrental scheme. For higher education, the TA will review subsector issues, incorporate and build \non results from an ongoing World Bank study on higher education financing (to be completed in \nSeptember 2007), and make recommendations on higher education development to meet the \nlong-term needs of the country.  \n \n16.  Sector Harmonization. The TA will assess (i) current implementation arrangements for \nprojects funded by development partners, and the feasibility of harmonizing such arrangements \ninto  one  unified  arrangement;  (ii)  effective  ways  for  integrating  similar  components  across \nprojects funded by different development partners to enhance development impacts; and (iii) the \nestablishment of an effective sector-wide monitoring and evaluation system, building on the \nongoing sector-wide approach exercise. \n \n17.  The TA will review resettlement issues, environmental impacts, civil works, and equipment; \nand will conduct economic and financial analysis, in accordance with established ADB policies \nand  procedures,  as  well  as  Government  regulations  and  procedures.  Fieldwork,  surveys, \ninterviews, focus groups, and workshops and seminars will be designed and conducted to meet \nTA objectives. The main TA findings will be disseminated widely in various forms to stakeholders, \nincluding through workshops, ADB\u2019s Web site, and publications.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost the equivalent of $706,000. The Government has asked ADB \nto finance $600,000. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded \nby  the  Government  of  Japan.  The  Government  will  finance  the  balance  of  the  TA  costs, \nequivalent  to  $106,000,  through  in-kind  contributions  of  office  space,  telecommunication \nconnections, logistical support (not including transportation), and salaries of counterpart staff. \n ", "  5\nDetails of the cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3. The Government has been \ninformed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  MECS will be the Executing Agency for the TA. A steering committee, chaired by the \nminister of MECS, will be established before TA activities begin to provide overall guidance to TA \nimplementation, including interagency coordination. The steering committee will consist of key \nofficials of MECS and the Ministry of Finance, including directors general of the departments of \nprimary and secondary education, vocational and higher education, and planning and investment \nof MECS. These officials will provide guidance and assistance to the consultant team to ensure \ntimely and effective TA implementation. The steering committee will appoint a focal point for day-\nto-day  coordination  between  MECS,  ADB,  and  the  consultant  team.  MECS  will  provide  the \nnecessary  conditions  for  timely  and  effective  TA  implementation,  including  access  by  the \nconsultant team to the necessary government documents and other relevant information.  \n \n20.  The TA will require 49 person-months of consulting services, comprising 17 person-\nmonths  of  international  consultants  and  32  person-months  of  national  consultants.  The \nconsultants  will have  expertise  in  (i)  education  sector  policy  and  planning  (including  ICT  in \neducation, and textbook provision); (ii) education economics and finance; (iii) higher education \npolicy and planning; (iv) teacher training (especially pre-service) planning and development; (v) \neducation facilities, civil works, and equipment; and (vi) social and environmental issues. The \nconsultants will be engaged through an international consulting firm using the quality- and cost-\nbased selection method, with a simplified technical proposal in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The outline terms of reference \nfor the consultants are in Appendix 4. The TA will provide office equipment necessary for TA \nimplementation (computers, printers, fax machine, scanner, among others). The TA equipment \nwill be procured by the consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as \namended from time to time) and transferred to MECS upon the completion of the TA. \n \n21.  The TA will be implemented over six months from September 2007 to March 2008. The \nconsultants will submit four reports, including an inception report by the end of the first month, a \nmidterm report by the end of the third month, a draft final report by the end of the fourth month, \nand the final report by the end of the sixth month after incorporating comments from ADB and the \nGovernment. TA findings will be presented in the interim, midterm, and draft final workshops with \nparticipation of all stakeholders.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n22.
