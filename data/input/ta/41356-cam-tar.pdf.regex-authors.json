INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Cambodia has requested technical assistance (TA) from the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  to  pursue  a  decentralization  program  to  reform  the  roles  and \nresponsibilities for subnational administration and to institute appropriate fiscal arrangements at \nsubnational levels. ADB\u2019s country strategy and program, 2005\u20132009,1 and country operations \nbusiness  plan,  2008\u20132010,2 highlight  the  importance  of  ADB  involvement  in  strengthening \npublic administration reforms in Cambodia, particularly in areas of public financial management \nand decentralization. A fact-finding mission for this policy and advisory TA was fielded from 8\u2013\n17  July  2009,  and  agreement  was  reached  with  the  Government  on  its  purpose,  scope, \nimplementation  arrangements,  and  financing.  The  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in \nAppendix 1.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Decentralization and deconcentration are key governance reforms for local democratic \ndevelopment and service delivery improvement. The election of commune councils in 2002 was \nthe first step toward these goals. Then, in 2005, a strategic framework established the basic \nprinciples and scope for a comprehensive decentralization program. This program now forms \npart of the good governance strategy of the National Strategic Development Plan, 2006\u20132010,4 \nwhich  has  been  extended  to  2013.  The  plan  defines  the  main  policies  and  principles  for \nadministrative reform at the provincial/municipal and khan (district) levels and for strengthening \nongoing sangkat (commune)-level reforms. The plan\u2019s overall objective is to enable subnational \nadministrations to participate effectively in the country\u2019s overall poverty reduction and economic \ndevelopment. The Government's Rectangular Strategy5 also recognizes good governance as a \npillar for sustainable socioeconomic development.   \n \n3.  In  May  2008,  the  Organic  Law  was  passed,  requiring  the  establishment  of  new \nsubnational structures and systems and reassigning functions and resources between national \nand subnational levels. It created a framework for (i) instituting three levels of subnational \nadministration  (provinces,  municipalities  or  khans,  and  sangkats)  with  elected  councils;  (ii) \nappointing boards of governors to act as both chief executives of the provinces/khans and \nsupervisors of provincial departments of national ministries; (iii) enabling councils to appoint \ntheir  own  staff  members;  (iv)  enabling  councils  to  be  responsible  for  their  own  financial \nadministration, with budgets approved by the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) and \nNational Assembly; and (v) establishing the National Committee for Democratic Development at \nthe Subnational Level (NCDD) to review ministries\u2019 functions and to determine which functions \nwill be assigned to subnational levels.  \n \n4.  NCDD  is  an  interministerial  entity  comprising  four  subcommittees  focused  on  (i) \nfunctions and resources, led by the Ministry of Interior (MOI); (ii) financial and fiscal affairs, led \nby MEF; (iii) subnational administrative personnel, led by the State Secretariat for Civil Service; \nand (iv) subnational policy, legislation, and guidelines of development plans and investment \nprograms, led by the Ministry of Planning.

A 10-\nyear National Program for Subnational Democratic Development (National Program) is also \nbeing prepared by NCDD and will be completed by the end of 2009. \n \n5.  A strong link between national priorities and plans with decentralized service delivery will \nenhance  the  effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  the  Government's  resource  utilization  and \nstrengthen accountability and transparency. Since 2008, ADB has been providing assistance for \nthis purpose through the Commune Council Development Project, phase 2.6 This project has \nprovided  commune  councils  with  necessary  facilities,  capacity  development  for  commune \ncouncilors and officials, and a civil registration system. Simultaneously, the Public Financial \nManagement  Program  for  Rural  Development7 is  strengthening  financial  management  and \ninternal audit processes in ministries associated with rural development as well as building the \ncapacity of the National Audit Authority.  \n \n6.  ADB's engagement with decentralization and deconcentration is critical to the overall \ndelivery of the country strategy situated in a range of sectors and thematic areas involving, \ndominantly, the lower tiers of administration. ADB staff members have undertaken intensive \nconsultation and dialog with a range of stakeholders (including MEF, MOI, Supreme National \nEconomic  Council,  provincial  and  district  administrations,  line  ministries,  and  development \npartners) and assessed areas of potential engagement on decentralization reforms. A scoping \nstaff study8 has also been commissioned and will be available in October 2009. On the basis of \nthese consultations and study, ADB's engagement with decentralization and deconcentration \nwill span the medium to long term and will include (i) assisting in implementation of the Organic \nLaw, especially the transfer of functions and resources to subnational levels; (ii) supporting \nfinalization of a subnational finance law and its implementation; (iii) building the capacity of \noversight agencies and select provincial and district councils whose members were elected in \nMay 2009; (iv) implementing and retrofitting the National Program; and (v) supporting detailed \narticulation  and  implementation  of  functions  in  select  sector  ministries  (e.g.,  the  rural \ndevelopment  sectors).  ADB's  comparative  advantage  is  its  strategic  view,  which  will  be \noperationalized and tested through specific interventions, starting with this TA. The TA outputs \nalso form priority areas of the draft National Program. \n \n7.  The  decentralization  program  is  fast  becoming  the  Government\u2019s  umbrella  reform \nprogram,  which  will  have  far-reaching  implications  in  government  systems  and  donor \ninterventions.  Despite  the  cautious  approach  of  many  MEF  senior  managers,  virtually  all \nstakeholders welcome the various forms of ADB support. There is a palpable need for advice on \nhow to proceed with reforms, and there is a shortage of skills to forge policy and legal drafting \nconsensus within MEF. There is a significant scope to design harder forms of infrastructure \ncapacity  development  and  general  budget  program  support  for  decentralization  and \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2006.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Grant to the \nRoyal  Government  of  Cambodia  for  the  Public  Financial  Management  for  Rural  Development  Program, \nSubprogram 1. Manila (Grant 0132-CAM, for $6.71 million, approved on 4 December). \n8\n The study will eventually design a road map for ADB's involvement over the next 2\u20134 years including (i) a proposed \ninstitutional framework for involvement, (ii) TA recommendations, (iii) program lending recommendations, (iv) \nproject financing recommendations, and (v) recommendations for the design and management of future sector \nsupport. \n ", "          3\n \ndeconcentration, which is likely to prove acceptable in relation to MEF borrowing policies. The \nassessments conducted with the Government (both MEF and MOI) strongly underscored the \nimportance of sequencing and the need for technical assistance on a priority basis. While this \nTA\u2014which is highly relevant for immediate involvement-- aims to allow time to review reform \ndevelopments, a proposed project preparatory TA in 2010 and a program in 2011 with a mix of \ndecentralization,  deconcentration,  and  infrastructure  support  will  help  deliver  an  integrated \npackage of governance and public service delivery at the policy and operational levels.  \n \n8.  ADB's support to the sector is closely linked to needs, and is coordinated with the \nsupport provided by other development partners.  Various informal subgroups are linked to a \ndevelopment partner decentralization and deconcentration technical working group, including (i) \na European grouping, which emphasizes democracy and broad governance and very supportive \nof further strengthening the grassroots commune approach; (ii) those associated with the United \nNations Development Programme, which is project-focused at provincial and district levels but \nstill influential on policy and programming direction within MOI and NCDD, where it is seen as \nthe  principal  decentralization  adviser  due  to  a  large  project  that  supports  democratic \ndevelopment.  This  project  will  be  ending  shortly,  with  the  Department  for  International \nDevelopment  of  the  United  Kingdom  withdrawing  funding  in  late  2009,  and  the  Swedish \nInternational Development Cooperation Agency poised to do the same in 2010 when current \nfunding commitments expire; (iii) those interested mainly in fiscal decentralization, including \nGTZ, United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF), United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, and \nWorld Bank; and (iv) another project-focused group, including the AusAID, Japan International \nCooperation Agency, and United States Agency for International Development.  \n \n9.  Currently the two main players in fiscal decentralization are UNCDF and World Bank. \nUNCDF's support is important in the policy and legal framework development, although funding \nis limited and there is no financing to support broader implementation as of yet. World Bank is \nconsidering a proposal to place a fiscal decentralization advisor within MEF and it has been \nagreed that this needs close coordination in relation to similar plans by ADB. Regular meetings \nwith  development  partners  over  the  past  year  show  that,  with  continued  consultation  and \nflexibility, there is adequate space in this working group for ADB. The prospects for another \nfruitful ADB and World Bank partnership in Cambodia on the important fiscal decentralization \narea are encouraging, especially in view of close and successful collaboration of the two in this \nsector in the Philippines.   \n \nI.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact of the TA will be that the regulatory framework for decentralization is in place \nand  operationalized.  A  key  performance  target  is  increased  subnational  government \nexpenditures at the provincial and municipal/khan levels. The outcome will be the adoption of a \nregulatory framework for decentralization by policy makers.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The key activities/outputs of the TA are as follows. \n \n(i)  Functional  assignments  linked  to  fiscal  needs/capacities.  Decisions \nregarding functional assignments must be made strategically and in a budgetary \ncontext. Policy advisory support will be provided to NCDD to draw together an \n ", " 4  \nintegrated and coherent functional assignments strategy, incorporating MEF\u2019s \nmedium-term  expenditure  framework  and  sector  plans/resource  allocation. \nRecent work on selected ministries\u2019 functions will be a useful starting point in \ndeveloping expenditure assignments. Functional assignment strategies will be \nprepared for the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries; Ministry for Rural \nDevelopment;  and  Ministry  of  Water  Resources  and  Meteorology,  including \nstrategies  and  budgets  for  redeployment  of  civil  servants.  Medium-term \nbudgetary implications of different scenarios for deconcentrating or decentralizing \nfurther functions will be examined. More empirical/budget-related work would \nalso be used for designing the intergovernmental financing system. As part of \nthis component, a review of the National Program to identify any priority areas \nwill be done. NCDD will be the Implementing Agency for this component. \n(ii)  Finalizing the legal/regulatory regime for fiscal arrangements. Section 6 of \nthe Organic Law is skeletal only and envisages further laws and regulations \nwithin the context of a subnational Finance Law, which is expected to be passed \nby  the  end  of  2009.  Since  the  draft  law  is  generic  and  provides  a  broad \nframework,  getting  the  lower  level  regulations  is  of  pivotal  importance.  This \ncomponent will finalize and fine-tune such legal reforms in close coordination \nwith other development partners, such as World Bank and United Nations Capital \nDevelopment Fund. The Local Finance Department (LFD) of MEF will be the \nImplementing Agency. \n(iii)  Intergovernmental  financing  arrangements.  This  component  will  focus  on \nfinancial  modeling  of  various  policy  options  for  finalizing  the  system  of \nintergovernmental  financing,  including  unconditional  equalization  grants  and \nconditional grants. It will also examine revenue assignments. Building on the \ncurrent body of work\u2014and given the current thinking of MEF and its tax division \nnot to decentralize any significant revenue powers\u2014this component is partly an \neducational/advisory exercise supplemented by modeling of fiscal implications for \ndevolving taxation powers. LFD will be the Implementing Agency. \n(iv)  Strengthening  institutional  coordination  arrangements  and  capacity. For \neffective  and  longer-term  management  of  decentralization,  institutional \narrangements  under  NCDD  will  require  longer-term  capacity  development \nsupport, in terms of both systems and human resources in selected ministries. \nLFD will also be provided training on local finance and fiscal decentralization \nareas and on establishing links with the NCDD work plan. Therefore, a capacity \nneeds  assessment  and  training  in  LFD  and  other  parts  of  MEF  will  occur. \nCapacity needs assessment and training on functional assignments in NCDD; \nMOI;  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Forestry  and  Fisheries;  Ministry  for  Rural \nDevelopment;  and  Ministry  of  Water  Resources  and  Meteorology  will  be \nprepared, including staff and budget redeployment in the latter three ministries. A \nlonger-term  option  of  establishing  a  local  government  academy  for  training \ncentral  and  subnational  officials  will  be  explored  in  terms  of  organizational \nstructure  and  resource  requirements.  NCDD  and  LFD  will  be  implementing \nagencies for this component. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,000,000 equivalent. The Government has \nrequested that ADB finance $800,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB's  TA  funding  program  (Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund-IV).  The  Government  will \nfinance  the  remaining  $200,000  equivalent  in  kind  by  providing  office  accommodation, \n ", "          5\n \ncounterpart staff members, and communication facilities.

Implementation Arrangements \n13.  The Executing Agency will be NCDD in MOI, and the Implementing Agency will be LFD \nin MEF. A small, high-level steering committee with representatives from both ministries will \nguide the implementation of the TA. It will meet regularly to review implementation progress and \ndiscuss any issues with the ADB project officer.  \n \n14.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  a  24-month  period  starting  in  November  2009. \nInternational consultants will be hired for 24 person-months and national consultants for 20 \nperson-months  to  provide  expertise  in  regional  autonomy,  fiscal  policy  aspects  of \ndecentralization, budgeting and planning, intergovernmental fiscal relations, intergovernmental \nfinancial arrangements, preparation of financial laws and regulations, and capacity building. The \noutline terms of reference and reporting arrangements are in Appendix 3. Four consultants for \n18 international and 20 national person-months, including the team leader, will be hired through \na  reputable  international  consulting  firm  after  the  biodata  technical  proposal  undergoes  \nquality- and cost-based selection (80:20). Two international advisers\u2014 the decentralization and \ncapacity-building advisers for a total of 6 person-months\u2014will be hired on an individual basis, as \nthese  distinct  areas  of  expertise  involved  may  not  be  available  through  a  single  firm.  All \nconsultants will be hired by ADB according to its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended from time to time). \n \n15.  NCDD and LFD will provide adequate furnished office accommodation for the TA team, \nincluding  telephone  and  fax  lines,  internet  connection  facilities,  and  workshop  secretariat \nsupport. Basic office and computer equipment will be procured and disposed by the consultants \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). The \ndisbursements under the TA will be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook.9 \n \nII.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Cambodia for Developing an Institutional Framework for Decentralization \nReforms, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2008.

Introduction \n \n1.  Consultants will design a policy framework and matrix of reform actions, which will \nadvance decentralization in Cambodia consistent with improvements in fiscal, financial, budget \nplanning, and management capacities in central agencies and subnational structures.
