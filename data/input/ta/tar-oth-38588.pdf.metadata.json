The  United  Nations  Economic  and  Social  Commission  for  Asia  and  the  Pacific \n(UNESCAP) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) jointly produced the first \nMillennium  Development  Goals  (MDG)  Report  in  2003,  which  provided  inputs  to  the  UN \nSecretary General\u2019s Report to the UN General Assembly on progress on the MDGs worldwide. \nThe Report (referred to as MDG Report I) served more than just that purpose. It enabled \nvaluable stocktaking on the status of the achievement of MDGs in the region, and highlighted \nthe significant distance that many countries were from achieving the MDGs and the relevant \nconstraints and issues. MDG Report I has received considerable attention in the region. The \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) was not formally associated with MDG Report I, although ADB  \nwas invited and  participated in the advisory committee, it  provided no funding support for \npreparing the Report. \n \n2.  The second and third MDG reports (MDG reports II and III), scheduled for 2005 and \n2007, respectively, are to  be incorporated  into  the  UN Secretary General\u2019s reports to the \nGeneral Assembly for those years. Both UNESCAP and UNDP felt that ADB\u2019s participation in \nthe project would greatly enhance the quality of MDG reports II and III and their usefulness in \nfurthering the MDG agenda in the region. A formal request for ADB to participate in the project \nwas  made  in  January  2004,  and  ADB  has  formally  agreed  to  participate  in  the  tripartite \nenterprise. ADB held several rounds of discussion with UNESCAP and UNDP staff in Bangkok \nand at ADB headquarters.  The technical assistance (TA) framework (Appendix 1) summarizes \nthe main aspects of the TA.    \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  On 2 July 2004, the Board approved the Review of the Poverty Reduction Strategy \n(PRS). The review recommends that ADB adopt a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation \nframework for assessing progress in implementing the enhanced PRS. It was recommended \nthat the  overall impact of  ADB\u2019s implementation of the PRS be gauged on the basis of the \nachievement of the MDGs. Given this mandate, there is need to emphasize the quality of \nreporting on MDGs and the strategies for achieving them.  \n \n4.  The data and reports on MDGs are usually prepared by or in collaboration with the UN \nsystem. Reporting on MDGs in the Asia-Pacific region began comprehensively through  MDG \nReport I, which provided an authoritative basis for assessing MDG achievements in the region. \nHowever, given the magnitude of the tasks, UNESCAP and UNDP alone can neither improve \nthe quality of the reporting nor address all the  priority issues. The MDG I Report  initiated a \ncomprehensive assessment of the status of MDG attainment, including the MDGs that were at \nrisk of nonachievement in the region and the binding constraints.   \n \n5.  MDG reports II and III need to go beyond, be of practical relevance to policy practitioners \nin the region, and provide information and guidance on how to attain the targets by 2015. Given \nthe immense tasks ahead, there is a need for prioritizing activities.  Some areas have been \nidentified for  greater emphasis and  priority action jointly by ADB, UNESCAP, and UNDP in \nconsultation with other UN agencies (paras. 6-10).   \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 7 October 2004. \n ", "2  \n6.  Improving Data Quality. There are severe gaps in data coverage relating to MDGs, \nweaknesses on the comparability of data across countries,  discrepancies between officially \nreported numbers and those estimated by independent surveys, and, consequently, problems in \nusing data for making assessments and projections. This is a medium-term issue that involves \nimproving data collection capacity, and efforts to improve techniques  to ensure accuracy of \nestimates. \n \n7.  Country Coverage\u2014Countries at Risk and Central Asia. Several countries\u2014mainly \nthe least developed in the Asia-Pacific region\u2014are unlikely to meet the MDG targets, given the \nconstraints in resources, institutions, and capacities. There are also subnational areas in many \ncountries that are similarly at risk of not attaining the MDGs. To better assist them, a special \neffort to identify these countries and subnational areas and their constraints is necessary. The \nMDG I Report did not adequately address the issues of the Central Asian countries. Issues \nrelating to these countries need to be included in future reports.   \n \n8.  Thematic Emphasis. Resources and institutional capacity appear to be general binding \nconstraints to MDG attainment in the region. The UN is doing considerable work at the global \nlevel on the resources issue.2 On the other hand, institutional constraints are  increasingly \nbecoming critical. There is a need to focus on institutions that can be changed in the medium \nterm (by changes in public policy).  \n \n9.  Special Issues. Various special issues concerning the MDGs may need particular \nattention. They include the following:  \n \n(i)  Hunger and  malnutrition. Although income poverty appears to be declining, \nthere are concerns that nutritional levels are stagnant in many cases. Several \ninternational  initiatives  are  being  taken  including  the  UN  meeting  convened \nrecently by the President of Brazil to discuss ways of eradicating hunger.   \n \n(ii)  HIV/AIDS.3 The impact of HIV/AIDS on economic development and poverty in \nthe region needs to be highlighted and strategies developed for controlling the \ndisease.   \n \n(iii)  Rural  poverty.  As  most  of  the  region\u2019s  population  still  live  in  the  poor \nunderserviced rural areas, rural development and poverty reduction may need \nspecial attention. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)  is stressing this \nfactor.   \n \n(iv)  Microinitiatives.  Small  community-led  and  local  initiatives  that  have  been \nsuccessful in MDG areas need to be highlighted or upscaled.  \n \n10.  Dissemination.  It  has  been  stressed  that  mere  publication  of  reports  will  not  be \nsufficient if the information and issues highlighted are not used by policy makers in the region, \naid  sources  and  other  stakeholders.  In  view  of  this,  reports  should  be  prepared  with \ndissemination in mind. An effective program of dissemination should be built into the process. \nUNESCAP  is  developing  a  detailed  dissemination  plan  that  includes  preparation  of \ndissemination material; policy dialogue with authorities and discussions with stakeholders at the \n                                                 \n2 The UN Secretary General has appointed Mr. Jeffrey Sachs to estimate financial resource gaps. \n3 human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.   ", "  3\ncountry  level  with  the  help  of  ADB  resident  missions  and  UNDP  country  offices;  and \ndissemination by web-sites.   \n \n11.  The above issues need to be taken care of through the reports and their dissemination.  \nAs MDG reports II and  III will have to be succinct (covering no more than 120 pages each), \nother important issues may be covered through an MDG technical paper series.    \n \n12.  Given the need to raise awareness, initiate  policy, investment and capacity building \nactions at the developing member country (DMC) level, particularly for DMCs that are at risk of \nnot meeting the MDG targets, this TA will  make a strong contribution toward achieving the \nMDGs in the region.  \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n13.  The TA\u2019s main goal is  to assist in achieving the MDGs, particularly in countries of the \nAsia-Pacific region that are currently at risk of not achieving the MDGs and where special efforts \nare necessary. It is envisaged that MDG reports II and III, and the background and supporting \ntechnical papers will raise awareness, lead to improved policies and institutions, and generate \nincreased resources and capacities for attaining the MDGs.  \n \n14.  The  main  outputs  of  the  TA  are  (i)  MDG  report  II  (scheduled  for  completion by \nSeptember 2005); (ii) MDG report III (scheduled for 2007); (iii) background and supporting \ntechnical papers; and (iv) dissemination of these reports and papers to appropriate audiences in \nDMCs so that greater awareness is created, and necessary action initiated by governments and \nall stakeholders for MDG attainment.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n15.  ADB, UNESCAP, and UNDP will closely monitor the outputs and outcomes (paras. 19-\n20). The reports will be prepared mainly by staff and consultants of the three organizations and \nthe wider UN system.  Dissemination of the document and policy dialogue will be coordinated \nthrough the ADB resident missions and UN country offices, and an effective dissemination plan \nwill be developed for this purpose. High-quality output will be ensured through close supervision \nof report preparation at every stage. This will help reduce the risk of mediocrity of outputs.   \n \n16.  It is envisaged that MDG report II will tentatively cover the following areas (although a \nfinal outline will be drawn up only after the steering committee finalizes the matter):  \n(i)  Provide an overview of achievements in the Asia-Pacific region and identify \ncountries for which special efforts are required and the main constraints in such \n\u201chigh risk\u201d countries in meeting the MDG targets. \n(ii)  Build a case for greater mobilization of financial resources to help DMCs achieve \nMDGs. \n(iii)  Collate and coalesce knowledge outputs of different UN agencies focusing on the \nMDGs through a series of technical and background papers. \n(iv)  Showcase selected knowledge products of ADB in which the institution has made \ndistinctive contributions, e.g., regional cooperation, gender and development, \npoverty research, water management, rural infrastructure, and good governance,  \n ", "4  \n(v)  Focus on some selected thematic or special issues (paras. 8-9). \n \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The TA, which includes supporting the preparation of both  MDG reports II and III and \ntheir dissemination, will cost around $4 million. UNESCAP and UNDP are allocating $1.5 million \neach. A total of $1.0 million (spread over 3 TA phases of $350,000 for phase 1 and $325,000 for \neach of phases 2 and 3) is proposed from ADB. Part of the ADB contribution would be given to \nUNESCAP for their implementation of the project. ADB will implement several activities directly, \nincluding,  contributions  to  chapters  of  the  main  report,  the  technical  paper  series,  and \ndissemination activities. The three organizations are working out the details.  \n \n18.  The present proposal is for phase 1 with a total cost of $1.4 million, of which ADB would \nfund  $350,000  (of  which  an  amount  of  $200,000  will  be  given  to  UNESCAP  for  their \nimplementation of the project) and a total of  $1.05 million would be funded by UNESCAP and \nUNDP. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The detailed \ncost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.    \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  The TA is an important collaborative exercise among ADB, UNDP, and  UNESCAP, \nwhich have all given their financial and staff resource commitments to ensure quality outputs. A \nformal cooperation arrangement will be entered into with UNESCAP and UNDP defining the \nroles and responsibilities of the partner agencies to ensure smooth implementation of the \nproject. ADB will be the Executive Agency for the TA to be implemented by RSDD/RSPR, which \nwill coordinate an interdepartmental effort for the purpose. UNESCAP will be mainly responsible \nfor report preparation, although inputs from ADB and UNDP will also play a major role. A \ndissemination plan will be drawn up involving close coordination among ADB resident missions \nand UNDP country offices.  \n \n20.  The first draft of the main MDG report II is expected by April 2005. A high-level steering \ncommittee is proposed comprising  the ADB Vice President for Knowledge Management and \nSustainable Development, UNESCAP Executive Secretary, and UNDP Assistant Administrator \nfor East Asia and the Pacific.  In  addition,  there  will  be  an advisory panel on the  reports \ncomprising regional experts on MDGs. A working group consisting of representatives at the staff \nlevel from the three organizations will coordinate the preparation and ensure the quality of MDG \nreports II and III.  \n \n21.  The phase I TA will engage 12 person-months of consulting services (6 person-months \ninternational, and 6 domestic) for the TA activities directly undertaken by ADB. The consultants \nto be  hired by ADB  will be  development specialists with experience in the area of MDGs \n(Appendix 3). The consultants will be engaged individually in accordance with the Guidelines on \nthe  Use  of  Consultants  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  and  Its  Borrowers  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. \n \n22.  The TA is phase I of a cluster TA that will run for 4 years altogether in three phases of 15 \nmonths each. The main purpose of phase 1 will be to support the preparation of MDG report II \nand its dissemination. Phase I will run from 1 October 2004 until the end of 2005 (15 months).  It \nis currently envisaged that Phase 2 will focus on dissemination activities of MDG report II, \npreparation of technical background papers, and preparatory activities for MDG report III. Phase ", "  5\n3 will focus mainly on MDG report III and its dissemination.  However, the content of the later \nphases  will  be  determined  based  on  the  needs  and  priorities  indicated  by  the  steering \ncommittee.      \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved  the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $350,000 on a grant basis for \nSupporting the Achievement of the Millennium Development Goals in the Asia-Pacific Region, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6   Appendix 1 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance  Monitoring  Assumptions and Risks \nDesign Summary \nIndicators/Targets  Mechanisms \nGoal       \n  Improvement in MDG  MDG Indicators \nBetter achievement in MDG  indicators from 2000 \nsectors, particularly in  figures in all countries in \ncountries currently at risk  the Asia-Pacific region \n  by 2008, particularly in \ncountries identified as at \nrisk in the MDG II report.  \n \nPurpose      Assumption \nPromote greater awareness  Strategies to attain  MDG country  Countries strongly support \nof MDGs, develop improved  MDGs adopted by  reports  MDG philosophy as \npolicies and institutions, and  governments, and  National poverty  reflected in their \nincrease resources and  alignment of policies and  reduction strategy  development documents, \ncapacities for MDG  institutions reflected in  documents  policies, and budgets. \nattainment.  all national poverty   \n  reduction strategy   \ndocuments by 2008   \n   \nBudgetary resources   \nconsistent with targets   \nallocated by countries  Country budgets \nfor MDGs by 2008    \n \nOutputs      Assumption \nMDG report II  All outputs completed  Quality  Staff resources are \n  based on schedule  assessment by  adequate for preparation of \nMDG report III  agreed on by ADB,  ADB  documents and \n  UNDP, and UNESCAP,    dissemination. \nTechnical Papers  and of acceptable quality  Timeliness of   \n  publications  Risk \nDissemination of reports and  assessed  External factors would \npapers   according to  cause delays in documents \n  agreed-upon  preparation. \ntimetable   \n \nQuality of \ndissemination \nassessed against \ndissemination plan \nand feedback from \nUNDP country \noffices and ADB \nresident missions \n \nActivities      Assumptions \nSteering Committee  Activities to support  Back-to-office  There is a good \nmeetings  outputs conducted on  report of ADB TA  understanding of the overall \n  schedule   implementation  exercise among ADB, \n  missions  UNDP, and UNESCAP. \n   \nContinued on next page", "Appendix 1  7 \nPerformance  Monitoring  Assumptions and Risks \nDesign Summary \nIndicators/Targets  Mechanisms \nAdvisory Committee reviews   \nand meetings   \nWorking Group reviews and   \nmeetings   \n   \nPapers preparation   \n   \nWorkshops and seminars for  Workshops provide quality \nreport preparation and  feedback and advice into \ndissemination  the process.  \n \nInputs      Risks \nADB: Financial ($350,000)  ADB and partners  Back-to-office  Financial inputs cannot be \nand staff resources for report  provide agreed-upon  reports of ADB TA  provided on time. \nand paper preparation,  inputs to support  implementation   \nreview and dissemination  activities and outputs.  missions  Supervisory inputs would \n  be insufficient to provide \nUNDP:  Financial ($525,000)  quality checks.  \nand staff resources for report \nand paper review and \ndissemination \n \nUNESCAP: Financial \n($525,000) and staff \nresources for report and \npaper preparation, review, \npublication and \ndissemination of documents   \n \nADB = Asian Development Bank, MDG = Millennium Development Goals, TA = technical assistance, UNDP = United \nNations Development Programme, UNESCAP = United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Pacific. \n \n \n ", "8   Appendix 2 \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($'000) \n \n    Total \nItem    Cost \nA.
