INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  In Papua New Guinea (PNG), 40% of the population has access to improved drinking \nwater  supplies,  and  just  19%  has  access  to  improved  sanitation.1 PNG  did  not  meet  the \nMillennium Development Goals for access to improved water supply and sanitation (WSS) and \nis not on track to meet its own targets of 70% access by 2030 and 100% access by 2050, as \noutlined  in  PNG\u2019s  Development  Strategic  Plan,  2010\u201320302 and  Vision  2050.3 The  PNG \nNational Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) Policy recognizes the need for substantially \nimproved access to water and sanitation services and hygiene behaviors, particularly among \ncurrently underserved rural and peri-urban settlement areas, and is being implemented by \nPNG\u2019s WASH project management unit (PMU).4 \n \n2.  The government requested Asian Development Bank (ADB) technical assistance (TA) to \nimprove water and sanitation sector management, and to strengthen the government\u2019s capacity \nto implement the WASH Policy.5 The proposed TA also forms a precursor to the District Towns \nWater  and  Sanitation  Project  preparatory  TA  (programmed  for  2017)  and  ensuing  loan \n(programmed for 2018), as reflected in the PNG country operations business plan, 2017\u20132019.6 \nADB is also processing a grant in 2017, Water Supply Scheme to Tete Settlement, which \ndirectly targets inadequate water supply services to a settlement on the outskirts of the capital, \nPort Moresby.  \n \n3.  Reconnaissance  missions  were  fielded  in  May  and  October  2016  and  government \nconcurrence was obtained for the proposed TA. The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1. The TA represents ADB\u2019s re-entry into PNG\u2019s water sector after the Provincial \nTowns Water Supply and Sanitation Project was completed in 2008.7  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  Urbanization. PNG is the largest and most populated Pacific nation, with a population of \nat least 7.5 million.8 The urban population of the capital Port Moresby is estimated at about \n800,000, of which more than half live in informal settlements. 9  While the urban growth rate is \n                                                \n1   World Health Organization/United Nations Children\u2019s Fund Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and \nSanitation. 2015.

The TA activities and \nimplementation arrangements described in the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1) were agreed \nduring these consultations.

Population, Total. http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL  \n(accessed 18 January 2017). \n9   Anecdotal evidence from the water utility servicing Port Moresby, Eda Ranu, based on water demand. \n ", "2   \naround 2%, growth rates in settlements of 5%\u20138% have been reported.10 This rapid urbanization \nhas contributed significantly to a growing landless class of people living in informal settlements \nwith little or no access to basic services. These settlements are now an established feature of \nthe urban landscape in Port Moresby.11 Similar trends are found in PNG\u2019s other cities\u2014Lae and \nMt. Hagen\u2014and most large provincial towns.  \n \n5.  Poor  service  levels.  Utilities  struggle  to  provide  acceptable  services  to  existing \ncustomers,  and  are  already  unable  to  cope  with  the  pace  of  urban  growth  in  formalized \ncommunities. Challenges are greater for extending services to settlements with insecure land \ntenure, those in peri-urban areas that may be more remote or outside of formal utility service \ndistricts,  and  those  on  land  that  is  technically  challenging  to  reach  with  conventional \ninfrastructure. PNG has approximately two-thirds of the entire population of the 14 Pacific \ndeveloping member countries, and sector performance in PNG has a huge impact on regional \naccess performance.12 \n \n6.  Public health. Limited access to improved WSS services undermines public health and \nis a main contributing factor to the high infant mortality rate (45 deaths per 1,000 births in \n2015).13 Waterborne disease, particularly diarrhea, typhoid, and cholera, accounted for 13% of \ndeaths and 14% of malnutrition in 2009, and stunting was attributed to the lack of safe water, \nbasic sanitation, and hygiene practices. Rates of diarrheal diseases in children under 5 years in \nPNG increased by 25% between 2009 and 2013.14 Public health challenges are accentuated by \nlarge household sizes, which are increasingly found in urban settlements, putting pressure on \nhousehold facilities and also increasing the likelihood of transmission of infection.15 Poor public \nhealth brings about low labor productivity, forgone employment opportunity, and added health-\nrelated  expenses  among  households,  which  in  turn  impacts  poverty  levels  and  imposes \nconstraints on sustainable development. Poor water and sanitation services impact women and \ngirls in particular, in terms of health, time, school attendance, and security.16 \n \n7.  Policy and governance. The limited attention afforded to WSS in PNG has resulted in a \nlack of effective organizational frameworks and coordination in the sector. The PNG National \nWASH Policy  was prepared with World Bank Water and Sanitation Program support, and \n                                                \n10  A. Schrecongost et al. 2015.

Port Moresby. \n15  Government of Papua New Guinea. 2010. National Health Plan, 2011\u20132020. Volume 1 Policies and Strategies. \nPort Moresby. \n16  Women and girls typically carry the burdens of water collection, time spent boiling water for drinking, and caring \nfor sick family members. Poor WASH in schools impacts school attendance, particularly for girls and female \nteachers. Focus groups report that women are at risk of attack at night when using bush toilets (World Bank. \n2014. Papua New Guinea\u2014Sanitation, Water Supply, and Hygiene in Urban Informal Settlements: Washington \nDC. Social Research Findings and Recommendations). In PNG, 11.4% of females report that security concerns \naffect their willingness to walk to fetch water, compared with 4.1% of males (National Statistics Office. 2013. \nHousehold Income and Expenditure Survey 2009\u20132010. Port Moresby. \n ", "  3 \napproved  by  the  National  Executive  Council  in  2015.  The  policy  recognizes  the  need  for \nsubstantially  improved  access  to  water  and  sanitation  services  and  hygiene  behaviors, \nparticularly among currently underserved rural and peri-urban settlement areas. It encompasses \nthe existing targets in the PNG Vision 2050; Development Strategic Plan, 2010\u20132030; and the \ncorporate plans of state-owned enterprises, among others; and clearly defines the sector targets \nto be achieved by 2030. The targets include that 95% of the urban population should have \naccess to a safe, convenient, and sustainable water supply, and 85% have access to safe, \nconvenient, and sustainable sanitation. Efforts toward meeting these targets will also place PNG \nin  a  more  favorable  position  to  meet  the  Sustainable  Development  Goals  for  water  and \nsanitation by 2030, while supporting the wider development agenda, particularly with respect to \nhealth and poverty reduction. The WASH Policy is currently being implemented by the existing \nWASH PMU, which will eventually graduate into the National Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene \nAuthority.17 The authority will continue the policy implementation via the district development \nauthorities, to which WSS service delivery was decentralized in 2014.18  \n \n8.  Sector  funding.  The  low  priority  traditionally  given  to  the  WSS  sector  by  the \nGovernment of PNG is also reflected by meager funding allocations relative to estimated needs. \nEstimates suggest that to achieve the government\u2019s sector targets, an annual investment of \naround $100 million is needed every year until 2030 for capital expenditure ($30 million for \nwater supply, $70 million for sanitation) and a further $20 million per annum for operation and \nmaintenance. 19  The  government\u2019s  (provincial,  district,  and  local  government)  Services \nImprovement Program comprises approximately K1.4 billion worth of funding per annum and \ntherefore represents a potential source of financing, although very little has been used to date \nfor water and sanitation.20 The National WASH Policy recognizes the need for increased sector \nfunding, and specifies several mechanisms to achieve increased funding allocation to support \nWASH infrastructure development, service delivery, and promotion.  \n \n9.  Institutional performance. In urban areas, two state-owned enterprises, Water PNG \nand  Eda  Ranu,  provide  reasonable  piped  water  and  sewerage  services.  Water  PNG  is \nresponsible for service provision on a commercial basis in district towns outside of Port Moresby. \nHowever it has no policy-making influence, and policy coordination with other agencies as well \nas with customers is limited. The most recent ADB assistance in PNG\u2019s water sector, the \nProvincial Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Project (completed in 2008), was rated partly \nsuccessful  in  improving  PNG\u2019s  urban  water  supply  and  sanitation.21 It  aimed  to  increase \ncoverage of water supply and sanitation in capital towns in six provinces and improve the \ndelivery of water supply and sanitation services by building capacity in Water PNG. However, \nthe capacity-building component of the project did not proceed as planned. There continues to \nbe a need to address institutional performance and coordination between key agencies, giving \ncareful consideration to barriers and enablers within the unique institutional context of the PNG \nwater sector.  \n \n                                                \n17  As per letter dated 26 October 2016 from the  PNG WASH PMU coordinator. \n18  Government of PNG. 2014.

Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The impact will be improved performance of the water and sanitation sector in PNG. The \noutcome will be the strengthened management and delivery of water supply and sanitation \ninfrastructure in PNG. The TA is in line with PNG\u2019s Vision 2050; Development Strategic Plan, \n2010\u20132030;  Medium-Term  Development  Plan  2,  2016\u20132017;22 and  National WASH  Policy, \n2015\u20132030. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  TA support to the WASH PMU from an experienced individual consultant will strengthen \nsector  coordination  and  leadership  and  ultimately  increase  access  to  improved  water  and \nsanitation, particularly in urban settlements, through (i) conducting an assessment of barriers \nand enablers to the delivery of improved WASH in PNG; (ii) reviewing the institutional structures \nof  the  Department  of  National  Planning  and  Monitoring  (DNPM)  and Water  PNG,  making \nrecommendations for institutional strengthening and identifying their respective human resource \nrequirements; (iii) assessing options for increasing WSS access in PNG settlements; and (iv) \nproviding  ongoing  advice  and  assistance  to  the  PMU  to  strengthen  peri-urban  WSS \nmanagement and coordination. An experienced water and wastewater advisory firm will (i) \nassist the DNPM and Water PNG to prepare water safety plans, and (ii) prepare feasibility \nstudies for  water  supply  and  sanitation  schemes  in  selected  district towns.  Draft terms  of \nreference for the individual consultant and the firm providing advisory services are in Appendix \n3. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $770,000, of which $700,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-VI). The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff available throughout the project duration, \noffice space, access to internet facilities, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  Water PNG is the utility responsible for service provision on a commercial basis in \ndistrict towns outside of Port Moresby and is the proposed implementing agency for the TA, \nalongside the DNPM. The proposed executing agency is the DNPM. ADB will provide oversight \nof the TA in close consultation with the DNPM. An individual consultant will be engaged to \nprovide TA support to the WASH PMU for 4 months, commencing in May 2017. A consultant \nfirm will be engaged separately to deliver specified outputs over a period of 36 months, from \nMay 2017 to April 2020.23 The individual consultant and firm will be recruited in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). Fund \ndisbursements  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  the  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n                                                \n22  Government of PNG, Department of National Planning and Monitoring. 2015.

While the TA will aim to develop context-specific solutions to the unique challenges PNG \npresents  in  terms  of  providing  effective  WSS  services  to  informal  settlements,  successful \napproaches  identified  will  find  relevance  both  in  the  Pacific  context  and  in  the  wider \ndevelopment community. ADB (in partnership with the DNPM and the WASH PMU) will identify \ngood practices and transferable lessons from the proposed TA that deliver outcomes beyond \nexpectation. ADB\u2019s Pacific Department will work in close collaboration with ADB\u2019s Water Sector \nGroup to disseminate appropriate knowledge products within ADB, across ADB developing \nmember countries (particularly in the Pacific region), and more widely among international \ndevelopment partners. Where applicable, the Pacific Water and Wastewater Association and \nPacific Regional Infrastructure Facility Water and Sanitation Sector Working Group may be \nmobilized to assist in this process. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n15.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $700,000 on a grant basis to \nPapua New Guinea for Support for Water and Sanitation Sector Management, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the TA is Aligned with \nPerformance of the water and sanitation sector in PNG is improved.a  \n  Performance Indicators  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  with Targets and Baselines  Reporting  Risks \nOutcome       \nManagement and  By December 2017, 44%  JMP, other sources  Government \ndelivery of WSS  of the population has  commitment to \ninfrastructure in PNG  access to safe water  improved delivery of \nis strengthened.   supply and 26% to  WSS weakens.  \n  sanitation facilities, of \nwhom half are women. \n(2015 baseline: 40% \naccess to improved water \nsupply, 19% to improved \nsanitation; half of PNG\u2019s \npopulation are female)b  \n   \nOutputs       \n1.
