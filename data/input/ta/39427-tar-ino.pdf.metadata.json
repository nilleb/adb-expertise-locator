The  Government  of  Indonesia  has  requested  technical  assistance  (TA)  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  for  the  Secondary  Mortgage  Facility  (SMF).  In  February  2005,  the \nPresident issued a decree on secondary mortgage financing to facilitate long-term financing for \nmortgages through securitization.1 The TA supports the start of operation of SMF. This is in line with \nthe country strategy to promote capital market development and financial market diversification and \ninnovation. The TA will establish operational guidelines, standardize documentation, build capacity \nfor the initial operations and formulate further financial assistance project by ADB. The TA also will \nidentify  impediments  to  successful  SMF  operations,  and  suggest  remedies.  The  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2  \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The demand for housing in Indonesia is significant and increasing. The backlog from low- \nand middle-income3 groups is high, driven in part by the rapid urbanization of the population. An \nimpediment to new construction is the lack of affordable financing.4 With the Government\u2019s policy to \ncontinue fiscal consolidation, the public sector is unable to meet all the underserved households.5 \nSustainable and fiscally affordable solutions would include significant investment from the private \nsector and households. Estimates show that only about 20% of housing has been built using formal \nfinancing  despite  liquidity  in  the  banking  system.  Without  suitable  housing  finance,  private \ndevelopers are reluctant to enter the middle or lower housing market.   \n3.  After a decline in 1998, mortgage lending has increased in the last six years.  Outstanding \nhousing  loans  totaled  Rp42  trillion  in  2004,  compared  with  Rp12  trillion  in  1997.  However, \noutstanding loans for housing and apartment ownership make up only 7.6% of the total loan assets \nof the financial sector.6 Financial institutions\u2019 unwillingness to enter the middle- and low-income \nsector for mortgage financing is mainly due to (i) lack of cost-effective, long-term matched local \ncurrency financing; (ii) lower profitability for smaller mortgages, because the lack of standards raises \nthe cost of documentation and administration of these loans; and (iii) lack of track record for the \nmiddle-  and  low-income  sector.  This  is  especially  true  for  smaller  commercial  banks,  regional \ndevelopment banks and finance companies. These institutions have the most potential for servicing \nthe middle and lower income housing sector. 7   Land titling and foreclosure has been raised as \nissues for all mortgages.  \n(i) Short-term deposits8 are the main source of financing for mortgages. This creates a \nmaturity  mismatch  for  financial  institutions,  and  thwarts  the  development  of  mortgage \nproducts  with  longer  tenors.  The  domestic  bond  market  has  developed  significantly, \nsurpassing the issuance and maturity levels before the Asian financial crisis that erupted in \n1997. However, only a few mortgage providers have issued long-term bonds in the domestic \nmarket9, possibly due to the higher cost of financing for these issuers. Access for mortgage \n                                                 \n1  Presidential Decree of the Republic of Indonesia Number 19 of 2005, Concerning Secondary Mortgage Financing. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 13 July 2005.  \n3  Low and middle income group is defined as those with income of up to Rp 2 million per month.  The value of housing that would be available to this \nincome group would be at maximum Rp 32 million. (Source: ADB. 2001. Housing Finance for the Poor Indonesia. Manila)  \n4  Hoek-Smit, Marja C. 2002 Implementing Indonesia\u2019s New Housing Policy: The Way Forward. Kimpraswil: Government of Indonesia and World \nBank \n5   For 2005, the Government plans to provide subsidies for 210,000 units or Rp735 billion. This is only 14% of the annual demand for the low-income \ngroup characterized as those with monthly income of Rp1.5 million and below. Source TA 4368-INO (ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the \nRepublic of Indonesia for the Financing Integrated Settlements Development Project. Manila (Phase 1 report).  \n6  The housing loans make up 30-34% in developed markets.  \n7  Consultants for Financing Integrated Settlements Development Project found that funding mortgages and the capacity of the regional development \nbanks have been two key issues for the availability of financing to low income home buyers.  \n8  At the end of 2004, 59% of deposits (including time deposits) were for a maximum of 1 month, while only 19% were for more than 1 year. \n9  Only three commercial banks have issued domestic bonds for 10 years.   \n ", "2   \nproviders to long-term financing through the securitization of mortgages, or even the creation \nof a secondary mortgage market, is difficult because the quality of loan documentation and \nappraisal procedures varies for each financial institution.     \n(ii) The lack of standard documentation or appraisal methods raises the fixed costs per \ntransaction by requiring a case-by-case approach. The costs drive down the profitability for \nthe smaller mortgages that lower- and middle-income buyers need.   \n(iii) Bank Tagungan Negara (BTN), which plays a predominant role in providing credit for the \nlower and middle income portion of the housing sector, is the only institution which has \nsignificant track record.10  Other commercial banks have been more conservative on risk \nvaluation due to the lack of a track record. Thus the decision based more on the credit of the \nborrower rather than the collateral value of the home. The banks have been inflexible about \nlowering the requirement for 30% down payment, which creates another challenge for lower- \nand middle-income buyers.  \n4.  There  are  three  SMFs  in  the  region,  CAGAMAS  Berhad  (Malaysia),  Korea  Mortgage \nCorporation, and Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation.   All three have been successful in contributing \nto increasing the affordability of housing through the creation of a secondary mortgage market as \nwell as development of the capital markets through lengthening maturity and spreading availability of \nmortgages.   \n5.  Pursuant to a Presidential decree, PT. Sarana Multigriya Finansial (PT SMF) was recently \nestablished by the Government to provide a market-driven approach to increasing mortgage loans \nby  addressing  the  main  issues  mentioned  in  paragraph  3.11    PT  SMF  is  scheduled  to  begin \noperations in the first half of 2006.  The function of PT SMF will be to purchase qualified mortgages \nfrom financial institutions and issue bonds backed by these assets. Since qualifying mortgages may \nnot be available from the start of operations, during the first 3 years, PT SMF will lend to financial \ninstitutions,  which  will  on-lend  for  qualifying  mortgages.  These  loans  will  help  build  qualified \nmortgage portfolios for purchase by PT SMF, as well as a track record for lower- and middle-income \nsectors. The target market for these mortgaged-backed securities will be long-term investors, such \nas insurance companies and pension funds, which have a natural appetite for bonds with long \ntenures.12 The Government has invested initial equity of Rp1 trillion to PT SMF. After the start of \noperations, equity investment will be solicited from the private sector with the aim of decreasing \ngovernment ownership to one third of total equity.  \n6.  To  be  qualified  for  purchase  by  PT  SMF,  the  loan  will  have  to  be  documented  and \nunderwritten with standard procedures prescribed by PT SMF. In this way, PT SMF will provide \neconomic incentive for financial institutions to use standard documents and procedures by providing \nsecondary  market  for  mortgages.  This  will  lower  the  costs  of  administering  mortgages  for  the \nfinancial institutions, as well as promote industry standards for prudent lending. PT SMF will train the \nfinancial  institutions  on  the  standard  documentation,  suggested  underwriting  guidelines,  and \nappraisal procedures.   \n                                                 \n10 Out of the 30 banks who participate in the government subsidy scheme to support the lower income households, BTN finances almost 67% of the \nhousing units (140,700 of 210,000 units). The Government aims to decrease the subsidy. \n11  The SMF concept was developed initially through ADB TA (ADB. 1996. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Indonesia for the Secondary \nMortgage Facility. Manila). \n12  Although sector reform is continuing, regulatory reform of the insurance and pension sector was addressed in Loan 1965-INO (ADB. 2002. Report \nand Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the Republic of Indonesia for the Financial Governance and \nSocial Securities Reform Program. Manila). Insurance firms and pensions may invest up to 20% of their portfolios in bonds issued by Indonesian \nentities (Financial Minister Decree No424/KMI, 06/2003 and No. 511/KMK 06/2003).   The investments of these financial institutions grew to \nRp105.2 trillion in 2003, from Rp55 trillion in 1999. \n ", "  3\n7.  The  Government  has  identified  a  set  of  legal  and  regulatory  issues  that  need  to  be \naddressed  to  accelerate  the  development  of  the  secondary  mortgage  market  and  mortgage \nsecuritization.  The main issues are (i) taxes, (ii) absence of a trust law and a securitization law, (iii) \nland titles, and (iv) legal processes for foreclosure.13 The Government plans to coordinate the \nreforms in these areas to create an enabling environment for effective structuring of transactions.   \nWith respect to (i) and (ii), preliminary drafts of regulations have been prepared to allow for tax-free \ntransfer of mortgages for securitization and securitization and trust laws have been drafted and is \nunder discussion.  (iii) and (iv) have been identified as issues for both primary and secondary market. \nWith respect to (iii) the World Bank is helping the Government develop the land policy and regulatory \nframework, including land titling; and build the capacity of local governments.14  ADB is assisting on \na per project basis through Financing Integrated Settlements Development Project.15 With respect to \n(iv), the principal problem is the attitude of the courts and auction office which is being addressed \nthrough judicial reform. This is seen as less of a problem for smaller sized loans.16  In the bond \nmarket, ADB has been providing input on the new Capital Market Law that will be submitted to \nParliament by the end of this year.   To strengthen the regulations further, the Minister of Finance \nendorsed  the  Action  Plan  for  Improving  Regulation  and  Supervision  of  Non-bank  Financial \nInstitutions. ADB supports the implementation of this Action Plan through technical assistance for \nthe Establishment of Financial Supervisory Authority.17 \n8.  In the Financial Governance Reforms Support Project, ADB supported plans to establish an \nSMF in 1998.18 The adverse changes in market conditions after the Asian financial crisis that \nerupted in 1997 made the environment unsuitable for an SMF. In addition, the amended Bank of \nIndonesia Act precluded the central bank from taking a stake in SMF. The SMF loan and equity \ninvestment component of the project was canceled in June 2001. Through reforms, financial markets \nhave stabilized and regained momentum. ADB supported the Government\u2019s efforts by providing \nurgently needed financial support immediately after the crisis, as well as assistance for fundamental \nlonger-term reforms.19  \n9.  Greater macroeconomic and financial stability in Indonesia and reforms discussed above \nagain have created conditions conducive for establishing an SMF. The volumes of the bond market \nand housing finance market are higher than before the financial crisis, while consolidation has \nstrengthened the banking sector. SMFs are key elements in the development of capital markets. \nSMFs help broaden and diversify the product base through the issuance of long-term securitized \nbonds, which provide a stable source of funds and mitigate risk.20 Moreover, the establishment of a \nhighly rated frequent issuer in the local bond market would create an attractive investment for \nregional investors. Working Group One of the ASEAN+3-supported Asian Bond Markets Initiative21 \nhas explored ways to increase new instruments to attract domestic and regional investors. The \ncreation of PT SMF, which would be a periodic bond issuer, would be in line with this objective.  \n                                                 \n13 Although cumbersome and inefficient, securitization is possible through existing laws. \n14  Land Management and Policy Development Project approved in March 2004. \n15  TA 4368-INO (ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Indonesia for the Financing Integrated Settlements Development Project. Manila). \n16  The lack of legal and judicial certainty has been identified as the weakest part of the financial system. Banks prefer to deal with smaller borrowers \nsince it is less likely for them to buy the type of justice that suits him/her (ADB. 2005. SERD Occasional Paper No.05-01 INDONESIA An overview of \nRecent Developments and Pending Issues In the Financial Sector) \n17  TA 3850 (ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Indonesia for the Establishment of a Financial Services Authority. Manila).  \n18  Loan 1618 INO (ADB. 1998. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to Republic of Indonesia \nfor the Financial Governance Reform Sector Development Program. Manila) which included equity investment for SMF was approved in June 1998. \nThe structure envisaged was for Bank of Indonesia and ADB to each hold 10% of the SMF, with 10 or more financial institutions holding the balance. \nThe weakened banks and financial institutions no longer had the capacity to invest in SMF. The assistance comprised a $1.4 billion program loan, \n$47 million investment loan for SMF, and $3 million equity investment.  \n19  ADB. 2004. Project Completion Report on the Financial Governance Reforms: Sector Development Program (Loan 1618-INO). Manila. \n20  Strategy 4.3, Promoting Development of Derivatives and Other Types of Securities, in the Master Plan 2005\u20132009 issued by Capital Market \nSupervisory Agency mentions securitization as one of the instruments that should be enhanced. \n21  The 10 ASEAN countries, PRC, Japan, and Republic of Korea launched the Asian Bond Market Initiative in 2002 to develop the local and regional \nbond markets.  Working groups have been set up to explore topics that would hasten development. ADB has assists the working groups through \nprovision of technical assistance.  \n ", "4   \n10.  The  Government  has  approached  ADB,  the  International  Finance  Corporation  and  the \nIslamic  Development  Bank  to  help  establish  an  SMF.  United  States  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment and the Netherlands Development Finance Company also are interested in providing \ngrant assistance. ADB has been coordinating with the other funding agencies to avoid duplication \nand encourage synergy.    \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.   Impact and Outcome \n11.  The intended impact of this TA is to increase access to affordable mortgages for low- and \nmiddle-income earners. The desired outcome is for PT SMF to start operations in 2006 and start the \nsecondary mortgage market. PT SMF will give access to long-term funds for mortgages, lower costs \nfor lower and middle income mortgages by giving economic incentive for financial institutions to \nadopt standard documentation and appraisal procedures, and facilitate the issuance of mortgaged-\nbacked bonds.  \nB.   Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will cover three areas. In the first two areas, the TA will establish the foundations for \nPT SMF operations. The third area will prepare a proposal for ADB financing for PT SMF. During the \ndevelopment  of  the  detailed  business  plan,  consultants  will  identify  impediments  to  secondary \nmortgage  market  development,  and  recommend  solutions.  These  will  be  discussed  with  the \nGovernment as a part of overall policy dialogue.   \n13.  First, the TA will help prepare for the start of PT SMF operations. International best practice \nwill be taken into account as basis for finalization of the guidelines and standards to be prescribed to \nthe  financial  institutions.  Inputs  from  relevant  stakeholders  will  be  sought  and  incorporated \nthroughout the TA since their buy-in is vital for success of PT SMF. The consultants will manage \nthese sessions and act as facilitator and raporteur. The TA will help three main areas. (i) The \nconsultants will finalize the detailed business and financing plans.  The plans will be based on a five \nyear demand estimate that will be confirmed by the consultants.  The business plan will include the \nmarketing plan and set targets for financial institution membership (especially a strategy for small \ncommercial banks, regional development banks and finance companies), and lending/purchase of \nmortgages.  The financing plan will include the amounts and types of financing as well as the plan \nfor accessing the bond market.  Preparation and timing for obtaining rating from credit rating agency \nand discussion on structuring should have detailed implementation plan. (ii) The consultants will \nfinalize  the  draft  internal  procedures  and  guidelines,  including  those  for  on-lending,  treasury \nactivities, risk management, mortgage purchase, securitization and problem debt resolution. (iii) In \nfinalizing the standards, consideration for changes in market environment will be taken into account \nas well as ease of use by the financial institutions. The consultants will complete the guidelines on \nproduct designs for mortgages including the rationale for the structure (i.e. tenure, floating/ fixed \ninterest rate, amortization, balloon payments etc.) and risks for the borrower and the lender.  Model \ndocuments such as the mortgage deed, model deed guarantee and mortgage facility agreement will \nbe  documented  for  ease  of  use  and  transferability  to  different  structures.  Property  appraisal, \nvaluation  and  underwriting  guidelines  will  be  finalized  with  recommendation  for  implementation \nincluding the skill mix necessary and monitoring mechanism.  \n14.  Second, the TA will train the key staff of PT SMF to train financial institutions, who will be \nresponsible  for  training  others  (training  of  trainers).  The  training  program  will  consist  of \nfamiliarization  with  the  standards  (component  1.ii),  case  study  of  the  underwriting  process  for \nmortgages  according  to  the  standards,  evaluation  of  past  mortgages  in  comparison  with  the \nstandard and on the job training with financial institutions.   Manuals will be produced for ease of \n ", "  5\nreplication. The training missions are planned to allow key staff to experience the operations of \nSMFs in the region, and to help create links for regional cooperation with other secondary mortgage \ncompanies. \n15.  Third, the TA will support MOF and ADB in preparing further financial assistance for the PT \nSMF. The consultants also will identify issues and recommend remedies for minimizing the risks to \nPT  SMF  operations.    These  recommendations  will  be  a  part  of  the  policy  dialogue  with  the \nGovernment on capital market development and housing finance.  The consultants will propose the \nbest package of financial support from ADB in accordance with the business and financing plan.  \nThese may include local or foreign currency loan for on-lending to financial institutions, bridge loan \nfacility for purchase of mortgages and/or as liquidity facility for securitization, partial credit guarantee \nto lengthen the maturity and lessen the interest burden for initial bond issuance by PT SMF and/or \nmortgage backed securities packaged by PT SMF and equity investment in PT SMF.   \nC.   Cost and Financing \n16.  The estimated cost of the TA is $750,000 equivalent, including foreign exchange costs of \n$412,000 and local currency costs of $338,000 equivalent. The Government of Indonesia has asked \nADB to finance $600,000 equivalent on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, funded by \nGovernment of Japan, covering the entire foreign exchange costs and local currency costs of \n$188,000 equivalent. The Government of Indonesia will provide $150,000 equivalent to finance \ncounterpart staff, office facilities, and other expenditures (Appendix 2).  \nD.   Implementation Arrangements \n17.  MOF will be the Executing Agency for the TA, while MOF Directorate General Financial \nInstitutions will be the Implementing Agency. MOF will appoint a project director who will coordinate \nthe MOF team and PT SMF staff. The TA will engage international consultants for 10 person-months \nand domestic consultants for 30 person-months. The international consultants will have extensive \nexperience in legal aspects of mortgages, secondary mortgage financing, and financial markets. The \ndomestic consultants will have expertise in financial markets, mortgage lending, and operations of \ngovernment entities. The outline terms of reference and reporting arrangements are in Appendix 3. \nConsultants will be recruited individually. Consultants who worked extensively on past studies of the \nmortgage market in Indonesia have been identified. Consultants will be selected and engaged in \naccordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to \nADB  for  selecting  and  engaging  domestic  consultants.  Procurement  under  the  TA  will  be  in \naccordance with ADB's Guidelines for Procurement. The TA will begin in December 2005 and be \ncompleted by July 2006. \n18.  An inception report, which will lay out detailed deliverables and clear responsibilities, will be \nproduced  within  three  weeks  of  commissioning.  Within  three  months  of  commissioning,  the \nconsultant team will report on the possible hurdles and remedies for PT SMF operations, as well as \non possible ADB investment. The team leader of the consultants will prepare monthly reports to \nMOF and ADB outlining the progress of the TA. The consultants will submit the final standard \ndocuments and guidelines under the scope of the TA. A draft final report will be provided in the \nseventh month.  \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n19.  The  President,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  by  the  Board,  has  approved  the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to the \nGovernment of Indonesia for the Secondary Mortgage Facility, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  and Risks  \nMechanisms  \nImpact      Assumptions \nLow- and middle- Increase in housing  \u2022  National housing  \u2022  Relative stability of \nincome earners have  starts for middle and  survey  housing markets \nincreased access to  lower income    \u2022  Sufficient volume of \naffordable mortgages  housing by 5-10% by  \u2022  Ministry of Housing  primary mortgages  \n  2010.   data  \u2022  Securities and Trust \n    Law passed within two \nIncrease in  \u2022  Survey of select  years of establishment \npercentage of small  commercial banks  \u2022  Many member \nand medium sized    financial institutions  \nhousing loans1 by 5- \u2022  Quarterly financial   \n10% by 2010.  reports of PT SMF  Risk \n    Financial institutions lose \nIncrease in the  interest or become unable \nduration of  to increase mortgage \nmortgages by 5\u201310  lending  \nyears by 2010. \nOutcome      Assumption \nSecondary mortgage  $25-50 million on- \u2022  PT SMF annual  \u2022  Banks accept the \nmarket is started by PT  lending of PT SMF to  report  standard documents \nSMF  financial institutions  \u2022  Survey of selected  and procedures \n  for qualified  financial institutions   \n  mortgages by June     \n  2007.    \n   \nFinancial institutions  $25-50 million \nunderwrite mortgages  mortgages \nunder standards  purchased by PT \nprescribed by PT SMF  SMF by June 2008. \nOutputs      Assumption \n1.
