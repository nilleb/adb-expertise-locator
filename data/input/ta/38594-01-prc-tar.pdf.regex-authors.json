During  the  2005  Country  Programming  Mission,  the  Government  of  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) requested technical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) for the design and implementation of integrated water resources management \n(IWRM)  reforms  in  Guiyang  Municipality,  Guizhou  Province.  The  proposed  TA  would \ncomplement  the  Guiyang  Integrated  Water  Resources  Management  Sector  Project \n(GIWRMSP), a firm project for 2007. The TA, as proposed, is expected to play a crucial role in \nexpediting IWRM reforms in Guiyang Municipality in order to enhance the enabling institutional \nenvironment. \n2.  During the Fact-finding Mission for the TA, which coincided with that for the GIWRMSP \nloan, an understanding was reached with the Guiyang municipal government on the impact, \noutcome, outputs, cost and financing, and implementation arrangements of the TA.1 The design \nand monitoring framework for the TA is in Appendix 1.  \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Guiyang Municipality is the capital of Guizhou Province, in the southwest of the PRC. It \nlies on the mountainous ridge of the watershed boundary between the Yangtze River basin to \nthe north and the Pearl River basin to the south. The annual average precipitation is quite high, \nbut uneven distribution and large losses through evaporation make water storage and capture \nparticularly difficult. Much of the water drains into rivers as quick surface flows through the many \nshort  creeks  and  streams  that  run  deep  in  the  valleys,  or  as  fast-flowing  deep  aquifers \n(groundwater rivers) through the limestone layers (karst areas). Water availability varies widely \nbetween seasons and from one year to the next. \n4.  Guiyang has a population of 3.5 million, 2.2 million of this are urban. As with most large \ncities in the PRC, the local economy is developing rapidly with structural and social changes. \nThere is significant migration from rural to urban population centers, seriously stretching the \nurban water supply capacity such that water pressure has weakened, water has had to be \nrationed, and there is not enough water for irrigation in dry periods. Guiyang forecasts an annual \nwater shortfall of 420 million cubic meters by 2010 and 642 million cubic meters by 2020. In the \nsurrounding rural areas, the shortage of water for drinking and irrigation is also seen as a critical \nconstraint on improving rural incomes and living standards. Farmers face difficulties growing \ntheir crops during the dry months from February to April, and, because of the short growing \nseason, cannot further diversify their cropping systems. Moreover, the majority of the rural \npopulation in smaller villages is not connected to a public water supply system and must depend \non local springs and streams. \n5.  The  project  preparatory  TA  for  GIWRMSP  identified  these  specific  water  sector \nmanagement  issues:  (i)  there  is  no  formal  process  of  stakeholder  consultations  and \ninvolvement; (ii) separate suburban water supply companies exist close to one another; (iii) local \ntownships, villages, and individual households manage their water supplies themselves and do \nso inefficiently, thereby losing the potential benefits from physical and management integration; \nand (iv) water and agriculture departments and local water users lack the coordination needed \nfor better designed irrigation systems and optimized cropping patterns. \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 17 August 2006. \n ", "2   \n6.  As  in  other  provinces  and  municipalities,  bureaus  in  Guiyang  are  subordinate  to \nprovincial  departments  and  ultimately  to  central  line  ministries  and  agencies.  The  water \nresources bureau coordinates water resources management at the municipal and lower levels, \nparticularly water resources planning, water allocation, water conservation, flood control, and \nrural water supplies. The urban construction and urban management bureaus manage urban \nwater  supply,  drainage,  and  wastewater  treatment  for  the  municipality.  The  provincial  and \nmunicipal environmental protection bureaus have important regulatory and enforcement roles in \nenvironmental  protection  and  pollution  control.  The  provincial  and  municipal  development \nreform commissions are authorized by the National Development and Reform Commission to \nparticipate in the approval of investment projects and, in most cases, to administer changes in \nwater tariff levels. Other ministries and provincial, municipal, and lower government offices \n(notably in agriculture, finance, health, civil affairs, land, trade and industry, and forestry) are \nalso involved in water sector issues. \n7.  The  responsibilities  for  the  management  of  the  Guiyang  water  sector  are  highly \nfragmented\u2014both vertically, between provincial, municipal, and district and county levels, and \nhorizontally, between functional departments at each level of government. This fragmentation \ncreates  problems  in  water  resources  management,  although  in  the  system  of  functional \nsupervision in the PRC, issues caused by vertical fragmentation are more easily resolved, \nthrough such means as directions and instructions from higher administration. The problems \narising from horizontal fragmentation are generally more difficult to deal with and have major \ninstitutional and technical implications including: (i) overlaps in monitoring and lack of data \nsharing,  (ii)  less  than  comprehensive  water  resources  planning,  (iii)  separation  between \npollution control planning and water resources planning, and (iv) unintegrated function zoning \nwithout harmonization of quantity and discharge licensing. \n8.  The  municipal  government,  recognizing  the  need  for  management  reforms  to  meet \nfuture  development  challenges,  is  committed  to  implementing  the  principles  of  IWRM.  An \ninteragency project leading group has been formed to steer the proposed GIWRMSP in the first \nphase of implementation of the Guiyang Integrated Water Resources Master Plan, which was \napproved by the government on 3 July 2006. The master plan is an important step for IWRM in \nGuiyang and covers all aspects of infrastructure needs while recognizing deficiencies in current \nwater sector management, including its fragmentation and the inadequate attention given to \nwater demand management. But the master plan is focused mainly on structural interventions. \nNonstructural measures for institutional reform and demand management also need to be made \npart of the master plan.  \n9.  Guiyang still lacks integrated institutionalized planning of water resources. The following \nchallenges to the implementation of IWRM remain: (i) local stakeholders are hardly involved in \nthe design, implementation, and operation of water projects; (ii) there is significant duplication of \nwater quality monitoring between water management agencies, which also lack coordination \nand  have  conflicting  responsibilities;  (iii)  information  sharing  between  water  management \nagencies  is  limited;  (iv)  the  public  is  generally  unaware  of  the  need  for  water  demand \nmanagement, and is not provided with incentives to conserve water; (v) economic instruments \nare inconsistently used, and water permits, for instance, are not applied at all to rural water use \nby farmers; and (vi) the sector has to contend with a variety of technical issues including \nconflicting water uses and environment function zoning. \n10.  These challenges will be addressed in part by the GIWRMSP. However, more focused \ninitiatives are needed to develop institutional capacity for IWRM. IWRM reforms will provide a \nbasis  for  improved  water  sector  management  in  Guiyang  by  rationalizing  institutional \n ", "  3\narrangements, improving interagency communications, promoting participation, and increasing \npublic awareness. The participatory nature of IWRM will improve the transparency of water \nsector management and make water conflicts less likely. Stakeholder analysis and participatory \napproaches will also allow better understanding of the potential social impact of water allocation \ndecisions, and, hence, better management of potentially adverse social impact. Efforts will be \nmade  through  IWRM  to  coordinate  and  optimize  water  supply  and  demand  management \nactivities. \n11.  The proposed TA will develop solutions based on IWRM principles, starting with the \nanalysis of a watershed catchment or sub-catchment area lying wholly within Guiyang so that \nthe municipal government can use its influence to achieve the intended aims and objectives. \nDepending on the results of the initiatives to introduce IWRM in local areas, ways and means of \nreplicating the approach elsewhere in the PRC and even at higher administrative levels will be \nsought. \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The TA will make it possible to implement institutional reforms and IWRM principles for \nwater sector management in districts and counties in Guiyang. The reforms will be replicated in \nother areas and, if appropriate, at higher administrative levels. The TA is expected to contribute \nto the success of the GIWRMSP by enabling a sustainable balance between water supply and \ndemand in Guiyang. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The TA will be implemented in two phases. In phase 1, to be conducted over a period of \n5 months, the consultants will undertake a comprehensive institutional assessment and develop \na  detailed  proposal  for  institutional  reforms  based  on  IWRM  principles.  Specifically,  the \nconsultants will: (i) review the master plan and examine the applicability of IWRM reforms \ncarried out elsewhere in the PRC to Guiyang and its master plan; (ii) on the basis of an analysis \nof a single river catchment area, document current institutional arrangements for water sector \nmanagement in urban and rural areas, and undertake system, stakeholder, and participatory \nproblem tree analyses to fully understand the constraints on the implementation of IWRM in the \ntownships,  counties,  and  municipalities;  (iii)  on  the  basis  of  these  analyses,  prepare  a \ncomprehensive strategy and a detailed set of proposals for the progressive implementation of \nIWRM principles in the selected area; (iv) prepare a training plan for key officials of Guiyang \nMunicipality who will be involved in the implementation of IWRM; (v) prepare an IWRM plan for \nimplementation over a wider area in 3 to 5 years and propose specific modifications in the \nmaster  plan;  (vi) prepare  proposals  for  the  monitoring  of  IWRM  implementation,  issues \nresolution, and stakeholder participation during  the implementation of the IWRM plan; (vii) \nidentify consultants and the expertise needed to implement and monitor IWRM actions in phase \n2; and (viii) assist the government in organizing the first workshop to discuss the proposals and \niTmhpel evmiewens teaxtipornes osef dt hhee rIeWinR aMre  tphloasne  ionf  tthhee  cpornessueltnancet a onfd  AdoD nBo, t innevciteesds anrialyti orenparle seexnpt ethrtoss, ea onfd A DloBc\u2019asl  \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \nstakeholders.  The  findings  of  phase  1  will  be  presented  at  a  participatory  workshop  and \ncontained in a comprehensive report to the municipal and local governments and ADB. \n ", "4   \n14.  In phase 2, to be conducted over 17 months, consultants will support the implementation \nof  the  proposed  institutional  reforms,  review  initial  experiences,  and  document  lessons. \nSpecifically, the consultants will: (i) work with township, county, and municipal stakeholders in \nintroducing  institutional  reforms  and  implementing  the  IWRM  plan  prepared  in  phase  1; \n(ii) document issues that arise and their resolution; (iii) deliver the training plan for key officials \ninvolved in the implementation of IWRM; (iv) review the original IWRM strategy and plan, and \nsuggest appropriate modifications (including modifications in implementation arrangements and \nmonitoring); (v) assist the municipal government in organizing the phase 2 workshops; (vi) work \nwith  provincial  officials  to  determine  the  legal  and  institutional  changes  needed  for  IWRM \nactivities that require higher approvals; and (vii) consider how the results of the TA can be \nreplicated in other parts of Guiyang, Guizhou Province, and the rest of the PRC, and make \nsuitable recommendations. The findings of phase 2 will be presented at the third participatory \nworkshop and incorporated into the draft and final reports of the TA.  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $750,000 equivalent. ADB will finance $600,000 \non a grant basis through its TA funding program. ADB financing will cover consulting services, \ninternational and some local travel, reports and communications, workshops, training and study \ntours, administration and support costs, and contingencies. The Government will finance the \nremaining  $150,000  equivalent  to  cover  the  remuneration  of  counterpart  staff,  some  local \ntransport costs, the provision of office accommodation, and other logistical support costs. The \ndetailed cost estimates are given in Appendix 2. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The municipal government, the Executing Agency for the TA, has set up a project \nmanagement office (PMO) under an interagency project leading group chaired by the vice \nmayor to support the consultants and government counterpart staff in the timely implementation \nof the TA. The PMO will also be responsible for the design and implementation of the proposed \nGIWRMSP. The PMO will ensure interdepartmental coordination and the TA team\u2019s access to \nreports, information, and data needed for the effective conduct of the TA. It will coordinate as \nwell with ADB during TA implementation.  \n17.  The TA will be implemented over a period of about 24 months, from March 2007 to \nFebruary 2009. It will be divided in 2 phases of 5 and 17 months, respectively. There will be a 2-\nmonth break in between the 2 phases to allow ADB, the municipal government and local \ngovernments to consider the phase 1 report and proposed IWRM plan, including the training \nplan for key officials of the Guiyang Municipality who will be involved in the implementation of \nIWRM. The TA will require 12 person-months of international and 40 person-months of national \nconsulting services. The individual consultants will be hired by ADB according to the Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (April 2006, as amended from time to time). The terms of reference \nfor the consultants are in Appendix 3. \n18.  The  team  leader  will  be  a  national  consultant  and  will  be  based  in  Guiyang.  The \ninternational water resources management specialist, who will have considerable institutional \ndevelopment experience, will participate on two separate occasions in phase 1 and on six \nseparate occasions in phase 2, for 1.5 person-months each time. The timing of this specialist\u2019s \n ", "  5\ninputs will coincide with the workshops and preparation of reports. The national specialists \nidentified for phase 2 will also take part in the phase 2 workshops.  \n19.  The TA reports will comprise: (i) an inception report, within 1 month of the consultants\u2019 \nmobilization, describing the work plan, the selection of the pilot catchment or subcatchment \narea, and unresolved issues; (ii) an interim report, 3 months after mobilization, with an account \nof progress made, preliminary results of analyses, issues that have arisen, and proposals for the \nresolution of the issues; (iii) a phase 1 report and IWRM plan, 5 months after mobilization, with \nthe  results  of  the  analyses  undertaken  and  detailed  proposals  for  IWRM  implementation, \nincluding a training plan for key officials who will be involved in the implementation of IWRM; (iv) \nTA implementation progress reports, to be prepared and submitted each quarter during phase \n2, with updates on the progress of IWRM plan implementation, issues that have arisen, and \nproposals for the resolution of these issues; (v) a draft final report, to be prepared and submitted \n15 months after the start of phase 2, with the full results of the TA, lessons learned, and an \naction plan for further steps in the implementation of IWRM; and (vi) a final report, incorporating \nfeedback from stakeholders on the contents of the draft final report, to be submitted at the end \nof the TA (17 months after the start of phase 2).  \n20.  The  training  plan  to  strengthen  capacity  for  the  implementation  of  IWRM  will  be \nformulated in phase 1 and delivered in phase 2 of the TA. The training plan may include \nregional study tours for key officials of Guiyang Municipality to see how IWRM is practiced \nelsewhere. It may also include study tours in the PRC to cities where water authorities have \nbeen established for a better understanding and appreciation of the institutional arrangements \nadopted to integrate the responsibilities of water management authorities. It will include training \nseminars delivered by the consultants. It will also include an international workshop with invited \ninternational  and  national  IWRM  experts  to  present  the  principles  of  IWRM  and  their \nexperiences from other cities and countries. \n  \n21.  Three participatory workshops will be held. The first workshop will be conducted near the \nend of phase 1 to discuss the IWRM plan, the training plan, and the proposed approach for their \nimplementation.  The second workshop will be conducted in the early part of phase 2 to present \nIWRM principles and experiences of invited international and national experts. The second \nworkshop will be one of the main components of the training plan. The third workshop will be \nconducted near the end of phase 2 to reinforce IWRM concepts, review the implementation \nexperience and consider the issues raised during the process, draw conclusions and lessons \nfrom the study, and discuss how these can be applied both locally and elsewhere in the PRC. \nAll three workshops will be attended by a broad range of stakeholder representatives, including \nADB. \nIV.

General Approach \n \n1.  The technical assistance (TA) will involve the investigation of institutional reforms and \ncapacity  strengthening  for  related  actions  necessary  to  promote  integrated  water  resources \nmanagement  (IWRM)  in  townships,  counties,  and  municipalities.  To  this  end,  one  local  river \ncatchment or subcatchment area lying wholly within Guiyang will be selected for detailed analysis \nand the implementation of pilot reforms based on IWRM principles, and institutional constraints on \nIWRM in the municipal government will be studied. In addition, the IWRM experience of the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and other countries relevant to the situation in Guiyang will be \ndocumented and used in drafting IWRM-based reform proposals for the townships, counties, and \nmunicipalities.  \n2.  The TA will be implemented in two phases. In the first phase, over 5 months, consultants \nwill prepare detailed institutional reform proposals and an IWRM plan for implementation, and \npresent  these  to  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  the  municipal  government,  and  local \ngovernments for consideration. After a 2-month break and approval of the proposals, the second \nphase will be conducted over 17 months, and consultants will support the trial implementation of \nthe reforms, review their initial experiences, and document the lessons. Necessary adjustments in \narrangements will be recommended in the light of experience.
