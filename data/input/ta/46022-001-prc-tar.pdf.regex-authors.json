INTRODUCTION \n1.  In December 2011, during the country programming mission, the Government of the \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  requested  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  technical \nassistance (TA) for (i) strengthening the integration of public asset management and budget \nmanagement; (ii) as a pilot case study for the first component, developing a public finance policy \nframework for the water resource management system; (iii) supporting the development of \naccounting services contributing to better public asset management and budget management; \nand (iv) developing knowledge products related to these three components. The 16\u201318 July \n2012 fact-finding mission reached an understanding with the government on the TA impact, \noutcome, outputs, cost estimates, financing plan, implementation arrangements, and terms of \nreference for consulting services. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Strengthen the integration of public asset management and budget management. \nPublic asset management and budget management should be priority areas for fiscal reform in \nthe PRC. Key public assets include public properties as a result of public investment, such as \ngovernment  buildings,  vehicles,  office  equipment,  road  and  other  public  infrastructure;  and \npublic resources such as forest, land, water resources etc. Budget management in this context  \nrefers to budget planning and preparation, as well as monitoring of budget implementation. \nWhile the government has implemented a number of fiscal reform measures, progress has \nfocused  more  on  revenue  than  the  budgeting  process.  The  budgeting  process  is  still \nincremental, with more emphasis on expenditures than public asset management. Lack of a \npublic asset management perspective in the budgeting process can lead to problems, such as \nimproper use and maintenance of public properties.  \n \n3.  Effective public asset management is becoming more important in the PRC as the \ngovernment is expanding its infrastructure investment program to increase domestic demand in \nthe midst of the global economic downturn, and to achieve balanced growth between central \nand western region and coastal areas. If the investment is implemented efficiently, it can benefit \n(i) the PRC by increasing its potential for future economic growth and (ii) the global economy by \nincreasing demand that neighboring countries can rely on for their economic turnaround. If the \ninvestment is not managed appropriately, it could damage long-term fiscal soundness and thus \nimpose greater risk on the global economy. \n \n4.  To maximize efficiency in utilizing public properties and public resources, the public \nasset  management  system  should  cover  the  whole  process  of  acquisition,  operation, \nmaintenance, and disposal of public assets. In addition, as the central government has to \ndelegate a significant portion of public asset management activities to local governments, it \nshould strengthen monitoring and assessment of local government performance. For this, the \ncentral government needs to establish  a centralized registrar of public assets, develop an \neffective  monitoring  system  using  up-to-date  information  technology,  carry  out  regular \nassessment of the performance of local governments, and incorporate assessment results into \nthe budgeting process. \n \n5.  Against this backdrop, the government aims to strengthen public asset management and \neventually integrate public asset management with budget management. The finance minister \nrecently stated an intention to strengthen the integration of public asset management and \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 31 July 2012. \n ", "2   \nbudget management, and proposed that the relationship between public assets and budget \nexpenditures should be carefully considered that the information about the value of public \nassets  will  be  fully  taken  account  of  for  the  whole  cycle  of  budget  management.  The \ngovernment  is  attempting  to  develop  a  holistic  approach  covering  both  budget  and  asset \nmanagement. This includes (i) establishing a standard public asset management framework, (ii) \ndeveloping an information system for effective public asset management, and (iii) integrating \npublic asset management with budget management. \n \n6.  Develop a public finance policy framework for the water resource management \nsystem.  In  the  PRC,  water  has  become  an  increasingly  scarce  resource  due  to  rapid \nindustrialization  and  climate  change.  Problems  such  as  water  shortages,  pollution,  and \necological degradation have become major constraints to sustainable development. To address \nthese  problems,  the  government  issued  the  Decision  on  Accelerating  Water  Management \nReform in January 2011 and the Opinions on the Stringent Water Management System in \nFebruary 2012.  \n \n7.  The government expects that the water management will achieve four major goals in \n2020:  (i)  flood  control,  drought  relief,  and  disaster  alleviation;  (ii)  optimized  allocation  and \neffective utilization of water resources; (iii) protection of water resources and enhancement of \necological sustainability; and (iv) scientific development of water resources. To achieve these \ngoals, the government will focus on three areas: (i) establish the macro-level water resource \nmanagement system based on the projection of total water consumption, (ii) set up the micro-\nlevel management system for efficient water resource use, and (iii) improve the water pollution \ncontrol system. \n \n8.  To  implement  the  water  resource  management  system  successfully,  a  fiscal  policy \nframework must be established to generate and properly manage sufficient fiscal resources. \nThe government is emphasizing the improvement of the overall water resource investment \nmechanism, which includes the management of funds to operate the water management system \nand  promote  water-saving  technology.  The  process  of  the  budget  allocation  for  water \nmanagement will be based on the integrated framework of public asset management and \nbudget management developed under the first component. \n \n9.  Support development of accounting services. Since 2005, the PRC accounting and \nauditing  standards  have  converged  substantially  with  the  International  Financial  Reporting \nStandards (IFRS) and International Standards on Auditing. A 2009 World Bank report indicated \nthat the Chinese Accounting Standards and IFRS became basically comparable.2 In addition, \nsignificant progress has been made in certified public accountancy, partly supported by TA \ngrants from ADB.3 \n \n10.  Nevertheless, gaps still need to be filled to make PRC accounting services consistent \nwith  other  leading  world  markets.  First,  discrepancies  between  the  Chinese  Accounting \nStandards  and the  IFRS,  such  as  the reversal  of  impairment  losses,  must  be  addressed. \nSecond, the professional expertise of certified public accountants needs to be enhanced to \nensure better compliance with the Chinese Standards on Auditing across auditing firms. \n \n                                                \n2  World Bank. 2009. Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes http://www.worldbank.org/ifa/rocs_aa_  chn.pdf \n3  For  example,  ADB.  2001.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  Strengthening  the  \nAccountancy Profession. Manila. \n ", "  3 \n11.  The government has adopted policies to tackle these issues. The Ministry of Finance \n(MOF) issued the Roadmap for Continuing and Achieving Full Convergence of the Chinese \nAccounting Standards for Business Enterprises with IFRS on 2 April 2010. The government has \nimplemented various policy measures to develop institutional capacity in accounting services, \nincluding issuing the Circular of the General Office of the State Council on Distributing the \nOpinions  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance  on  Accelerating  the  Development  of  Certified  Public \nAccountants. Such steps are beneficial to the development of accounting services and to the \nfacilitation of free trade and market opening in the services sector. Both domestic and foreign \ninvestors may increase their investments, particularly in service industries, based on enhanced \nconfidence in the PRC economy brought about by improved confidence in financial statements. \nFor the government itself, strengthened accounting services will also contribute to better public \nasset management and budget management. Accordingly, the government plans to develop a \npolicy  roadmap  for  (i)  opening  up  accounting  services;  (ii)  strengthening  its  international \ncompetitiveness; and (iii) promoting international cooperation in the supervision and market \ndevelopment of accounting services. \n \n12.  The TA is closely in aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132015 for the \nPRC, which identifies good governance and capacity development as comprising one of four \nkey drivers of change.4 To help achieve good governance, ADB will support government efforts \nto strengthen the policy, legal, fiduciary, and regulatory frameworks and practices to (i) improve \ndelivery and management of infrastructure and public services, and (ii) promote the enabling \nenvironment for private sector development. The TA will support the government in improving \nthe sustainable delivery and management of infrastructure services such as water resource \nmanagement,  as  well  as  public  services  such  as  asset  management.  It  will  also  provide \nassistance to develop accounting services, which is critical to private sector development. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The impact of the TA will be improved efficiency in utilizing public assets, effective \nutilization of water resources, and strengthened competitiveness of accounting services. The TA \noutcome will be integration of public asset management and budget management process, \neffective public finance policy framework for the water resource management, and adherence to \ninternational standards of accounting services in the PRC. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities  \n14.  The TA will help the government (i) improve fiscal management through strengthening \nthe integration of public asset management and budget management; (ii) develop a public \nfinance  policy  framework  for  the  water  resource  management  system;  and  (iii)  support \ndevelopment of accounting services by strengthening market competitiveness and enhancing \ninternational  cooperation  for  supervision  and  market  development.  For  each  of  the  three \ncomponents, the TA will conduct an international case study to identify lessons from countries \nthat have already developed good practices. Based on results from international studies and \nreview  of  the  national  situation,  the  TA  will  develop  policy  recommendations  for  each \ncomponent. Finally, the TA will arrange opportunities for staff capacity development such as \ninternational seminars and international study tours. \n \n                                                \n4  ADB. 2012. Country Partnership Strategy: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2011\u20132015. Manila.  \n ", "4   \n15.  The TA will deliver four major outputs: \n \n(i)  A study on strengthening the integration of public asset management and \nbudget management. The TA will conduct the following activities: (a) analyze the \ncurrent status of budget management in the PRC, (b) review international best \npractice in integrating public asset management and budget management, and (c) \nprovide policy advice on improving public asset management. The final outputs \nwill  be  three  policy  reports  on  (a)  reforming  public  asset  management,  (b) \ndeveloping an information system for effective public asset management, and (c) \nintegrating public asset management and budget management. \n \n(ii)  A  public  finance  policy  framework  for  the  water  resource  management \nsystem. The TA will conduct an international case study on the fiscal aspects of \neffective water resource management. Based on the study, the TA will provide \npolicy recommendations for implementing public finance policies for the water \nresource  management  system.  The  recommendations  will  include  securing \nsufficient financial resources, managing funds properly, and implementing various \nwater-saving  technology  programs.  The  process  of  the  budget  allocation  for \nwater management will be based on the integrated framework of public asset \nmanagement and budget management developed under the first component. The \nTA will produce a report on developing the public finance policy framework for the \nwater resource management system. \n \n(iii)  Support for development of accounting services. The TA will support the \ngovernment in developing policies for (a) opening up accounting services; (b) \nstrengthening the competitiveness of accounting services, including accelerating \nthe professional development of certified public accountants in the PRC; and (c) \npromoting international cooperation in the supervision and market development \nof accounting services. \n \n(iv)  Knowledge  products  for  researchers,  and  senior  policy  and  decision \nmakers. Based on TA outputs, knowledge products, such as policy and technical \nnotes that target researchers and policy and decision makers, will be produced. \nThe knowledge  products  will  cover  the  issues  on  integration  of  public  asset \nmanagement and budget management, public finance policy framework for the \nwater resource management system, and development of accounting services.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $900,000, of which $750,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff,  office  supplies,  domestic \ntransportation, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  MOF\u2019s International Department will be the executing agency. The TA will have three \nimplementing  agencies:  (i)  MOF\u2019s  Administrative  and  Law  Enforcement  Department  for \ncomponent 1, (ii) MOF\u2019s Agriculture Department for component 2, and (iii) MOF\u2019s Accounting \nRegulatory  Department  for  component  3.  For  each  of  the  three  components,  an  advisory \ncommittee will be established comprising representatives from relevant government ministries. \n ", "  5 \nRepresentatives from Ministry of Water Resources will be included in the committee for the \nsecond component. \n \n18.  The TA will engage four international consultants and 12 national consultants for a total \nof 92 person-months. Due to the diversity of the three components, a single firm cannot provide \nwell-qualified  consultants for the  entire  project.  For  components  1  and  2,  ADB  will  recruit \ninternational and national consultants on an individual basis; while for component 3, ADB will \nrecruit  a  firm  to  provide  one  international  consultant  and  three  national  consultants.  For \nrecruitment of a firm, the preferred selection method is quality and cost-based selection with a \nquality\u2013cost  ratio  of  80:20.  If  no  appropriate  firm(s)  can  be  identified  for  component  3, \nconsultants  will  be  recruited  on  an  individual  basis.  ADB  will  engage  the  consultants  in \naccordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to \ntime).  The  TA  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  the  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). The advance payment facility \ncan be used for equipment, seminars, workshops, and conferences. \n \n19.  The TA is expected to begin on 1 November 2012 and be completed by 31 October \n2014. Assembling TA consultant teams and setting detailed work plans will be completed by \nDecember 2012. Analysis of the current status of budget management and accounting services \nwill be completed by March 2013. Workshops, seminars, and international study tours will be \norganized from April to October 2013. Final reports will be delivered during March\u2013May 2014. \nBased  on  the  TA  results,  knowledge  products  such  as  policy  and  technical  notes  will  be \nproduced by August 2014. \n \n20.  In addition to the main outputs, the consultants will submit the following reports to ADB \nand MOF\u2019s International Department: (i) inception reports 2 weeks after commencement of their \nservices,  (ii) interim  progress  reports  at  an  appropriate  stage  during  TA  implementation,  \n(iii) draft final reports before the conclusion of the contract, and (iv) final reports 2 weeks after \nreceiving comments from the International Department and ADB. All reports must be submitted \nin English. \n \n21.  The International Department and ADB review missions will regularly monitor and report \non major project activities. Consultant reports will be presented at workshops and seminars \norganized to validate findings. Reports will be made available on the ADB website in English, if \nappropriate, and published whenever appropriate. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $750,000 on a grant basis to \n \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for Improvement of Fiscal Management and \nAccounting Services Supervision, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n    Data Sources   \nDesign Summary  Performance Targets and  and   \nIndicators with Baselines  Reporting  Assumptions and Risks \nMechanisms \nImpact       Assumptions \nImproved efficiency in utilizing  Integrated public asset  Government  The government \npublic assets, effective  management and budget  policy  continues to be committed \nutilization of water resources,  management measures are  announcements  to related reforms \nand strengthened  implemented for 3 key central  and official  Macroeconomic stability \ncompetitiveness of accounting  government agencies and in 3  statistics  will be maintained \nservices  provinces by 2018     \n \n  PRC Water \nWater consumption per CNY\u2019000  Resources Report  Risks \nof industrial value added      Government agencies \ndecreases 2% per year from 2012  Report on the  and local governments \nto 20301  observance of  lack capacity to \n   standards and  implement reforms \nChinese Accounting Standards  codes  The water resource \nand Chinese Standards on    management system \nAuditing recognized as acceptable    imposes so many burdens \nfinancial reporting and auditing    on the economy that it \nstandards by major capital    cannot be implemented \nmarkets by 2018    effectively \n \nPrivate companies resist \nthe adoption of stricter \naccounting and auditing \nstandards \nOutcome      Assumption \nintegration of public asset  A budget management system  Government  The government can \nmanagement and budget  incorporating public asset  policy  invest sufficient resources \nmanagement process,  management designed by 2015  announcements  to develop necessary \neffective public finance policy      policies and develop \nframework for the water  The fiscal policy framework for  Reports to the  stakeholder capacity \nresource management, and  water resource management  State Council   \nadherence to international  formulated by 2015    Risks \nstandards of accounting    The previous \nservices in the PRC  The certified public accountants  management model of \n  law amendment and  public assets delays the \nimplementation regulations issued  adoption of the new \nby 2015  framework \nPrivate entities, such as \nmanufacturing companies \nand households, resist \nstricter and high-cost \nwater management \nLess-developed regions \nexperience delays in \nadopting new accounting \nand auditing rules \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
