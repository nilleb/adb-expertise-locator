INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) actively supports development and use of solar \nenergy. In May 2010, ADB launched the Asia Solar Energy Initiative (ASEI), which aimed to \ndevelop and implement 3.0 gigawatts (GW) of solar photovoltaic (SPV) power in Asia and the \nPacific by 2014. ASEI achieved this target in late 2014 with the installation of 3.8 GW of SPV \npower. Overall, ASEI\u2019s aim was to create a market for SPV investments in the region while \nhelping bring generation costs down to grid parity. This has been achieved in some developing \nmember  countries  (DMCs)  such  as  India,  where  SPV  generation  has  reached  less  than \n$0.06/kWh. \n \n2.  ASEI met its target through three interlinked components: (i) sharing knowledge on the \nlatest  developments  in  SPV  technology  and  interacting  with  manufacturers,  (ii)  supporting \nproject development, and (iii) innovatively financing SPV projects through clean technology \nfunds. Based on these components, the effective exchange of knowledge through cross-country \nconsultations and regional workshops encouraged DMC governments to consider solar energy \nin their overall energy mix and for improving the security of their energy supply. \n \n3.  South Asia has about 300 days of sunshine per year and solar radiation that is generally \nbetween 3.6 kilowatt-hours (kWh) and 6.2 kWh per square meter per day. The commercial \npotential of solar power generation for grid connection is estimated at 3.0 GW in Bangladesh \nand 2.1 GW in Nepal. Solar energy is therefore an ideal source for meeting the region\u2019s growing \ndemand for electricity, improving energy security, and promoting the development of sustainable \nclean energy in the region. \n \n4.  The  governments  of  Bangladesh  and  Nepal  requested  ADB  support  for  technical \nassistance (TA) to promote off-grid and grid-connected solar power solutions to meet the growth \nin electricity demand. The governments concurred on the TA\u2019s scope, impact, outcome, outputs, \nimplementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference. The TA\u2019s \nproposed  Bangladesh  component  is  included  in  ADB\u2019s  country  operations  business  plan \n(COBP), 2016\u20132018 for Bangladesh.1 The COBP prioritizes (i) promoting renewable energy in \nrural  areas,  (ii)  reducing  dependency  on  imported  fossil  fuels,  (iii)  implementing  energy \nefficiency, and (iv) addressing climate change impacts. \n \n5.  Although the TA\u2019s proposed Nepal component is not included in ADB\u2019s COBP, 2016\u2013\n2018,  it  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2013\u20132017  for  Nepal,  which \nprioritizes developing grid-connected and off-grid electrification solutions in the energy sector.2 \nThis TA is not included in the regional cooperation operations business plan, 2016\u20132018 for \nSouth Asia.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n6.  The high cost of providing conventional power generation and supplying electricity to \nlarge numbers of end-users in remote areas, where the consumption of electricity is low, is the \ncommon factor that contributes to energy poverty in South Asia. In most cases, electrifying \nremote rural areas is not viable without government subsidies. Bangladesh aims to achieve 100% \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2014.

Manila. \n ", "2 \naccess to grid-connected electricity by 2022 from its current level of 65%, and Nepal aims to \nincrease its electrification ratio from 54% to 100% by 2026. In 2015, the per capita electricity \nconsumption was only 390 kWh/year in Bangladesh and 102 kWh/year in Nepal. To achieve \ntheir 100% access target, both governments are promoting SPV and other renewable energy \nsolutions to supply electricity in off-grid areas. \n \n7.  In Bangladesh, the publicly owned installed power generating capacity is about 6.0 GW \nagainst the current peak demand of 8.2 GW. The peak load demand is met through power \ncontracted from short-term private generators. In Nepal, the installed generating capacity is only \n0.78 GW, below the peak demand of 1.2 GW. As a result, grid-connected consumers in both \ncountries experience 8\u201312 hours of seasonal power cuts per day. To address power shortages, \nBangladesh plans to install 2.0 GW of renewable energy-based capacity by 2030 and increase \nelectricity imports from India. Although rich in hydropower resources, Nepal still needs to import \nelectricity from India to make up for the shortfall in generation. Nepal is constructing three large \nstorage-type hydropower plants and four run-of-river hydro schemes, but 2019 is the earliest \nany  of  them  could  make  power  available  to  the  grid.4 In  addition,  70%  of  the  generated \nelectricity would be exported to India and bring much-needed revenue for Nepal. The generated \npower  coupled  with  the  plants  planned  for  private  sector  investments  will  help  meet  the \ndomestic electricity demand of about 2.0 GW by 2020 and 4.5 GW by 2030 in Nepal.5 \n \n8.  Both countries need to complement their energy mix with other clean energy sources to \naddress seasonal water variations, decrease load shedding, reduce fossil fuel consumption, \nbring  down  greenhouse  gas  emissions.6 This  will  help  to  improve  energy  security  and \nenvironment protection. Many South Asian countries are scaling up the use of SPV technology, \nwhich has become less costly since 2013 and has reached grid parity in some countries. \nHowever, even though off-grid and grid-connected SPV power generation capacity has been \ntechnically  proven  worldwide,  only  364  megawatt-peak  (MWp)  is  currently  installed  in \nBangladesh and 640 kilowatt-peak in Nepal. \n \n9.  Rural electrification will benefit local communities at large and specifically women by \nreducing their household labor time, improving access to health services, strengthening security, \nand creating income generating opportunities. Although it is essential to expand and strengthen \ntransmission and distribution networks in rural areas to provide wider electricity coverage, it is \nimportant to go beyond the meter (i.e., counting the number of new connections installed) by \nensuring that these connections include the poor and disadvantaged communities and provide \nthem with revenue earning opportunities. \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impacts and Outcome \n \n10.  The TA impacts will be (i) increased access of Bangladesh and Nepal to affordable, \nreliable, clean renewable energy sources and technologies by 2025; (ii) increased innovative \n                                                \n4  Hydropower plants are being constructed in Arun (900 megawatts [MW]), Upper Karnali (900 MW), and Upper \nTrishuli (216MW). Negotiations are ongoing for the 600 MW Upper Marshyangdi and 650MW Upper Tamakoshi III \nhydropower plants. \n5  World Bank. 2015. Project Information Document (PID) Appraisal Stage: Power Sector Reform and Sustainable \nHydropower Development Project in Nepal. Washington, DC. \n6  In Bangladesh natural gas accounted for about 75% of power generation in 2014, with the balance coming from \ndiesel and fuel oil (21%), coal (2.0%), and hydropower (2.0%). In Nepal, hydropower accounted for 93% of power \ngeneration in 2014, with diesel accounting for the balance (7%). \n ", "3 \nemployment and livelihood opportunities for (a) poor households headed by women (HHWs), \nand (b) women living below the poverty line (BPL) in rural remote off-grid areas of Bangladesh \nby 2022;7 and (iii) 92% energy access in Nepal achieved by 2025.8 The TA outcome will be \ngender-responsive  and regionally  replicable  SPV  technologies  promoted  as  a  clean  power \nsource in Bangladesh and Nepal. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  Based on the lessons learned from programs in the People\u2019s Republic of China and \nIndia, knowledge management is key to catalyzing the region\u2019s solar market growth potential. \nThe TA will promote developing solar power technologies in off-grid and grid-connected areas of \nBangladesh and Nepal by building institutional and stakeholder capacity; pilot testing solar \npumping systems to increase agricultural production; developing women-led livelihood activities; \nand showcasing and sharing knowledge on good practices, solutions, and lessons learned. \n \n12.  Bangladesh component. The TA will be implemented in parallel with and will provide \nsupport and capacity development for the beneficiaries of the SPV pumping system for the \nagricultural irrigation subproject of the Power System Efficiency Improvement Project.9 The \nsubproject, which has a $20 million budget, will replace diesel-run irrigation with 1,500 off-grid \nSPV pumping systems for agriculture and aquaculture (with a total capacity of 6 MWp).10 \n \n13.  The  TA  will  provide  SPV  equipment  for  learning  purposes  and  demonstrate  clean \nenergy\u2019s social and gender impacts through testing women-led SPV-based microenterprises in \nrural off-grid areas, including the development of business models.11 The TA will also (i) educate \nwomen, particularly HHWs and BPL women, on the safe  and  efficient  use of SPV  electricity; \n(ii) organize women-led water management groups; and (iii) implement education and campaign \nactivities to disseminate information on efficiently managing SPV pumps and water systems. \n \n14.  The  TA  will  develop  a  public\u2013private  partnership  business  model  for  SPV-powered \nwomen\u2019s enterprises. Vulnerable HHWs and BPL women will be trained on solar-powered \nenterprises, including operation and maintenance (O&M). At least 120 vulnerable HHWs and \nBPL women will be trained on formulating SPV pumping system and drinking water-based \nlivelihood plans. \n \n15.  The TA has the potential to become a best practice, innovative case study for gender \nmainstreaming in a sector where social and gender impacts are less known. Good practices and \nlessons learned from the pilot will enhance the scope of replicating and scaling up SPV-based \ninitiatives with strong social and gender design features in other DMCs in South Asia. \n                                                \n7  Government of Bangladesh, Parliamentary Standing Committee on Ministry of Environment and Forests. 2010. \nBangladesh Environment and Climate Resilient Sustainable Development: Vision 2021.

Manila. \n10 During peak season in Bangladesh, 1.30 million diesel-run pumps are operated to irrigate 3.40 million hectares \nusing 0.90 million tons of diesel, emitting 2.87 million tons of carbon dioxide (CO ) equivalent/year (3,188 kilograms \n2\nof CO  equivalent/ton of diesel). The SPV capacity has a factor of 16.1%; the off-grid emission factor in \n2\nBangladesh is 0.6407 tons of CO2 equivalent/megawatt-hour (MWh)/year. With the subproject\u2019s 6 MWp capacity, \n8,462 MWh of electricity can be generated, abating 5,117 tons of CO  and saving 1,605 tons of diesel yearly. \n2\n11 SPV-based training systems (i.e., SPV pumps, water filters, container-based SPV battery storage) with a 70 \nkilowatt-peak capacity will generate 99 MWh of energy, abate 60 tons of CO , and save 19 tons of diesel yearly. \n2\nThe power system project will help the beneficiaries be more familiar with the business management of rural SPV \npumps. TA consultants will conduct the design and procurement for and supervise the implementation of the pilots. \n ", "4 \n \n16.  The TA will strengthen the technical capacity of the Bangladesh Rural Electrification \nBoard,  other  government  agencies,  and  civil  society  organizations  on  O&M  and  the \nmanagement of the new rural SPV water pumps. Bangladesh Rural Electrification Board staff \nwill  be  trained  on  gender  sensitivity,  O&M,  and  management  of  SPV  pumping  and  water \nsystems. A gender- and socially inclusive community outreach and preparatory engagement \nplan will be formulated and implemented. Functional regulations and tariff agenda for promoting \nSPV pumping and water systems in rural remote off-grid areas will be assessed in coordination \nwith the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission using the existing Feed in Tariff for Wind \nand Solar Electricity Regulations, 2015 (draft).12 \n \n17.  Nepal  component. The TA will demonstrate the technical, regulatory, and financial \nviability  of  utility-scale  solar  systems  (i.e.,  rooftop  and  ground-mounted)  to  promote  the \nexpansion  of  solar  power  generation  in  the  country.  Under  the  South  Asia  Subregional \nEconomic Cooperation Power System Expansion Project, the government requested $20 million \nadditional  grant  financing  from  the  Strategic  Climate  Fund  to  support  the  installation  of \nadditional 25 MWp aggregate utility-scale SPV power capacity.13 \n \n18.  The TA will assist in strengthening the institutional and technical capacity of the Nepal \nElectricity Authority by (i) formulating a renewable energy policy on SPV feed-in tariff and net \nmetering to promote renewable energy development; (ii) improving the design of utility-scale \nSPV  systems  and   the  capacity of  electric  utilities  to  design   SPV power  initiatives;  and  \n(iii) developing innovative business models to address the high up-front costs of renewable \nenergy systems, including project identification, technology screening, financing schemes, and \ntariffs related to utility-scale SPV systems. The TA will also support technical engineering design \nand business structures, including a public\u2013private partnership model for SPV-based technical \noptions for one or two SPV plants. \n \n19.  Regional component. Under the TA, the project team will organize knowledge sharing \nbetween Bangladesh and Nepal through field visits, and among South Asian DMCs through \nregional workshops. The workshop organizers will disseminate the experiences of the countries\u2019 \nimplementing agencies to exchange views on operational challenges, tariffs, and regulatory \nissues; and how these were addressed. Knowledge sharing will enable the replication of off-grid \nsystems in Nepal based on Bangladesh\u2019s experiences, including on solar water pumping. From \nNepal\u2019s experience, Bangladesh can learn how to structure a ground-mounted SPV system \nconnected to the grid, including grid-integration issues. \n \n20.  The main risks during TA implementation would be (i) no ownership of gender aspects of \nthe project by the implementing agency  officials, including lack of  commitment to women-\ntargeted interventions by local government officials and stakeholders; (ii) changes in national \npolitical landscapes that could affect the ability of local governments to pursue infrastructure \ndevelopment;  (iii)  high  staff  turnover  in  the  implementing  agency;  and  (iv)  a  change  in \ngovernment priorities for the energy sector, including slow prioritization of access to renewable \nenergy-based  power.  Measures  such  as  providing  capacity  building  support  and  creating \nawareness on the beneficial use of renewable energy sources conducive to climate finance can \nbe considered to mitigate these risks. \n                                                \n12 Government of Bangladesh, Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission. 2015.

The  TA  will  be  monitored  through  review  missions  and  lesson-learning  workshops. \nLessons learned from other development partners will help improve project design. The project \nteam will also prepare and share case studies to document good practices, innovations, lessons \nlearned, and benefits of off-grid and grid-connected SPV based on the experience of and \nknowledge generated from the TA\u2019s Bangladesh and Nepal components. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n22.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.31 million equivalent, of which $350,000 will be financed \non a grant basis by the Danish Cooperation Fund for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency \nin Rural Areas, $750,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the Second Danish Cooperation \nFund for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency in Rural Areas,14 and $214,000 will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Strategic Climate Fund.15 ADB will administer these grants. \nThe grant funds will be disbursed on a pro rata basis as detailed in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n23.   ADB will be the executing agency for the TA. The Sustainable and Renewable Energy \nDevelopment  Authority  will  be  the  implementing  agency  in  Bangladesh,  while  the  Nepal \nElectricity Agency will be the implementing agency in Nepal. \n \n24.  ADB will require 17 person-months of international and 21 person-months of national \nconsulting inputs for Bangladesh, and 10 person-months of international and 15 person-months \nof national consulting inputs for Nepal. The consultants for Bangladesh will be engaged through \na consulting firm using fixed-budget selection; a simplified technical proposal; and a full lump \nsum contract. For Nepal, four international and five national consultants will be engaged using \nindividual consultant selection. The consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with the \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013 as amended from time to time). ADB will procure \ngoods and services following its Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). \nThe TA proceeds will be disbursed in line with ADB\u2019s  Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time).
