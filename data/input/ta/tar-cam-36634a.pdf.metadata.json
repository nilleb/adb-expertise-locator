In 2002, the Government of Cambodia requested advisory technical assistance (TA) \nfrom the Asian development Bank (ADB) to meet priority research needs for inland fisheries, in \nthe framework of the Tonle Sap Initiative.1 On 21\u201325 October 2002, an  ADB Fact-Finding \nMission visited Cambodia and formulated TA for Capacity Building of the Inland Fisheries \nResearch and Development Institute, in line with the program of actions formalized in the \nPoverty  Reduction  Partnership  Agreement  between  the  Government  and  ADB. The TA is \nincluded in ADB's 2002 program for Cambodia.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Literature on Cambodia's inland fisheries makes frequent reference to the abundance of \nfish in the Tonle Sap ecosystem and the expertise of the fishers who exploit this bounty.3 \nWithout  a  doubt,  inland  fisheries  are  indispensable  to  the  food  security,  income,  and \nemployment of the Cambodian population.4 Yet, attention is increasingly being drawn to the \nimpacts of overfishing and destructive practices.  King Norodom Sihanouk has warned that \nCambodia faces environmental disaster if the ecosystem of the Tonle Sap is further degraded. \n \n3.  It is urgent to sustain the productivity of fisheries and to rationalize their use. Yet, basic \ndata  concerning  fish  populations,  their  environment,  and  their  exploitation  is  often  patchy, \nmostly old, and in general cannot support decision making. Original research is still scarce and \nreports habitually quote early works.5 For instance, information on the bioecology of key fish \nspecies is plainly inadequate.6 But it is also necessary to model flood-fish relationships in the \nTonle  Sap;  investigate  improvements  in  marketing,  distribution,  and  utilization  of  key  fish \nproducts; and circumscribe better the value of the fisheries (using market-based methods, \nmethods  based  on  surrogate  market  values,  and  those  based  on  potential  expenditure  or \nwillingness  to  pay).7 This calls for a substantial increase in the body of bioecological and \nsocioeconomic knowledge. To leverage the contribution of research to sustainable management \nand conservation of natural resources and biodiversity, the Department of Fisheries (DOF) in \nthe  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Forestry,  and  Fisheries  (MAFF)  began,  in  April  1994,  to  collect \nprimary data; to conduct studies to  evaluate and modify fisheries management for optimal \n                                                 \n1  ADB recognizes that sustainable management and conservation of natural resources and biodiversity should be \nconsidered from the perspective of the watershed feeding the Tonle Sap. ADB's Country Strategy and Program \ndocuments for Cambodia reflect this sectorwide approach to the Tonle Sap, which ADB expects to pursue over a \n10-year horizon. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet Edition) in November 2002. \n3  At 110\u2013175 kilograms per hectare per annum, the productivity of Cambodia's inland fisheries is among the highest \nin the world. High temperatures and periodical flooding explain this. However, the role of the flooded forest is also \nacknowledged: it facilitates development of microorganisms, weeds, and zooplankton; provides shelter to juveniles \nand specific adult species; and offers reproduction zones for other species. \n4  Fish provide 40\u201370% of the protein intake of Cambodia's population, and the annual catch from the Tonle Sap \nrepresents about 75% of the national inland fish catch. Fishing and agriculture are the two main sources of \nlivelihood for the 3 million people (25% of Cambodia's population) who live around the lake. \n5  The first publications on aquatic ecosystems date from 1865. From then to the 1930s, numerous taxonomic \ndescriptions appeared and remain the only scientific works in the field of ichthyology. From the perspective of \nfisheries, the only other scientific contributions to understanding of the Tonle Sap's physical and biological \nenvironment appeared in the 1950s and 1960s. A third series of expert opinions emerged in the early 1990s with \nthe work of the Mekong River Commission. \n6  This refers to fish breeding, feeding patterns and behavior, and development to adulthood, including the role of \naquatic habitats and seasonal variations. \n7  Knowing the economic values of fisheries is an important step in measuring the costs and benefits of large-scale \ndevelopments, which may be potentially environmentally unsustainable, so that the right policy direction is \nundertaken and development options are explored. \n ", "2 \nresource utilization, in terms of production and sustainability; and to clarify the macroeconomic \nimportance of fisheries. It also laid plans for the establishment of a research and development \ninstitute for inland fisheries to strengthen the capability to produce, adapt, and use knowledge.8 \n \n4.  The Inland Fisheries Research and Development Institute (IFREDI) was constituted in \nlate 2002 as a physical, legal, and organizational entity reporting  to DOF. Its mission is to \npromote sustainable development and use of living aquatic resources based on environmentally \nsound  management.9  It  is  comprised  of  a  section  for  biological  research  and  resource \nassessment, and one for socioeconomic research, and oversees two field stations for lake and \nbagnet  fisheries.10  Its  research  program,  to  be  delivered  by  about  30  research  staff  now \nassigned  to  the  Project  for  Management  of  the  Freshwater  Capture  Fisheries,  has  been \noutlined. At this early stage, the opportunity exists to establish a well functioning research \nsystem  with  high  standards  for  analytic  rigor  and  effective  scientific  reporting  and \ncommunication. From a small base, it is important that capacity to plan and undertake research, \nand to extend and disseminate findings, be built. \n \n5.  Fisheries  research  can  work  to  (i)  make  fish  more  affordable;  (ii)  add  to  the \ndiversification  of  fisheries;  (iii)  generate  employment  and  income  for  fishers;  (iv)  create \nalternative  livelihoods;  (v)  conserve  and  rebuild  fish  stocks;  (vi)  provide  policy  advice  on \nmanagement arrangements for common aquatic resources, from insights into the external \nfactors that impinge on their use; and (vii) buttress community efforts to manage aquatic \nresources and protect biodiversity. Research to these ends can reduce poverty and is supported \nby ADB's policy on fisheries,11 which is guided in turn by ADB's policy on agriculture and natural \nresources research. 12 Within that framework, ADB seeks to enhance the capability of national \nresearch systems in the priority areas of (i) addressing socioeconomic issues relating to open \naccess and overfishing; (ii)  fishery resource studies to provide information on their present \nstatus; (iii) ecologic-economic studies to characterize and quantify interactions between the \nfisheries sector and other sectors, the results of which are important inputs to policy analysis; \n(iv)  studies  on  nonmarket  valuation  and  natural  resource  and  environmental  accounting  to \n                                                 \n8  In these endeavors, DOF received early and steady support through the Project for Management of the Freshwater \nCapture Fisheries, Phase I (1994\u20131998) and Phase II (1999\u20132002), for $2.3 million and $3.1 million, respectively, \nfunded by the Government of Denmark and implemented by the Mekong River Commission. \n9  IFREDI's terms of reference are to (i) identify and monitor the development of freshwater fish and other living \naquatic resources that are importance to the economy, food security, and the maintenance of biodiversity; (ii) \nestablish an inland fisheries research program and carry out research in subjects related to the ecological, \nbiological, technical, and socioeconomic aspects of fisheries; (iii) research the impacts on living aquatic resources \nof dam construction, irrigation schemes, and other development activities; (iv) establish information storage \nsystems; (v) disseminate scientific and technological information to raise awareness of conservation needs and \nmanagement options; (vi) research the relationship between freshwater fisheries and aquaculture; (vii) provide \ntraining in freshwater fisheries and their management; (viii) cooperate with local, nongovernment, and international \norganizations; and (ix) engage in income-generating activities related to the research agenda. \n10 The Biological Research and Resource Assessment Unit's terms of reference are to undertake research and \nadvise on (i) fish biology and ecology (biodiversity, habitats, migration patterns, reproductive dynamics); (ii) impacts \non fisheries of habitat degradation and environmental change; (iii) impacts on living aquatic resources of fishing \nactivities and practices; (iv) resource management systems; and (v) the capture fisheries and aquaculture \ninterface. The Socioeconomic Research Unit's terms of reference are to undertake research and advise on (i) \nresource user characteristics; (ii) fishing practices and technologies; (iii) economic valuation of fisheries; (iv) fish \nmarketing and price formation; (v) social impacts of habitat degradation and environmental change; and (vi) \ngovernance systems. \n11 ADB. 1997. The Bank's Policy on Fisheries. Manila. \n12 ADB. 1995. The Bank's Policy on Agriculture and Natural Resources Research. Manila. ADB's policy identified \nresearch as an important intervention requiring ADB support to address the three critical issues of (i) reducing \npoverty; (ii) sustainable management of agriculture and natural resources; and (iii) increasing the productivity of \nagriculture in the Asian and Pacific region. \n ", "    3 \nextend  the  conventional  cost-benefit  analysis,  which  will  ensure  meeting  the  sustainability \ncriterion in fisheries projects; and (v) sustainable aquaculture studies. Building the capacity of \nIFREDI offers opportunities in each of these priority areas. Continued support for public sector \nresearch is needed, since the private sector has limited interest in nor mandate for supporting \nresearch agenda in inland fisheries.13 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Outputs \n6.  The goal of the TA is sustainable management and conservation of natural resources \nand biodiversity in the Tonle Sap basin. Its purpose is to kick-start IFREDI as an efficient, \neffective, and relevant research and development institute.14 Its outputs will lie in the realms of \n(i) institute management; (ii) research and development; (iii) technology transfer; and (iv) policy \ndevelopment and dialogue.15 The TA framework is in Appendix 1.16 \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n7.  Not enough of the world's knowledge is relevant to the poor, and the TA ascribes equal \nimportance to the production, adaptation, and use of knowledge in situ for development of \npolicies for pro-poor sustainable growth. Activities toward the four outputs will invest in people \nand share skills and knowledge in Cambodia, with an accent on learning and on-the-job training. \n \n8.  Institute Management. To accomplish the output in management, activities under the \nTA will (i) conduct planning exercises, including drafting an accounts and administrative manual, \nthe  first  medium-term  research  plan,  the  first  annual work plan, the first human resource \ndevelopment plan, and the first annual budget; and (ii) report on performance. \n \n9.  Research and Development. To accomplish the output in research and development, \nactivities under the TA will (i) expand knowledge of the bioecology of key fish species, focusing \non species that are important to local livelihoods; (ii) model flood-fish relationships in the Tonle \nSap  to  determine  the  relationship  among  natural  fish  production,  flooding  patterns,  and \nenvironmental parameters; and initiate the development of a hydrology and land-use decision-\nsupport system to be utilized by IFREDI; (iii) investigate improvements in marketing, distribution, \n                                                 \n13 The low purchasing power of poor people provides them no immediate means and incentives to invest in research \nthat meets their long-term development needs. \n14 The TA would complement the suite of loan and TA projects, as well as projects to be submitted to the Government \nof Japan for financing under the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, that ADB proposes in the context of the Tonle \nSap Initiative. \n15 The principles underpinning accomplishment of outputs will be sustainability, equity, gender and development, \nparticipation, anticipation, and systems thinking. \n16 The factors that conditioned formulation of the TA included (i) a diagnostic analysis that clearly defined problems \nand investigated their causes; (ii) a driving need for the TA, with commitment at the highest levels of MAFF; (iii) \nownership and close collaboration at the highest levels of DOF to accomplish the agreed upon objective of the TA; \n(iv) a focused work program that is based on a realistic objective and deliverable outputs; (v) an allocation of \nresources geared to the objective and deliverable outputs; (vi) a realistic time horizon that reflects the absorptive \ncapacity of IFREDI and recognizes the complexities and time requirements of capacity building; (vii) a well-\ndesigned program of process improvement that should include transfer of skills to IFREDI staff to operate the \nprocess; (viii) the establishment of achievable measures of progress and milestones to determine the effectiveness \nof progress; (ix) a management actively involved in directing and leading the process; (x) effective monitoring and \nsupervision of TA implementation and progress; and (xi) mechanisms to ensure that improvements are maintained \nupon completion of the TA. \n ", "4 \nand utilization of key fish products; and (iv) circumscribe better the value of fisheries to elucidate \npolicy directions. \n \n10.  Technology Transfer. To accomplish the output in technology transfer, activities under \nthe TA will (i) conduct specialized and on-the-job training; (ii)  facilitate communication and \ndisseminate ni formation; and (iii)  develop skills in planning research projects and preparing \nfunding proposals. \n \n11.  Policy Development and Dialogue. To accomplish the output in policy development \nand dialogue, activities under the TA will (i) establish linkages between IFREDI and key fishery \nstakeholders; (ii) build consensus for community-based management of aquatic resources; (iii) \nidentify and prepare pro-poor policy options in fisheries; and (iv) establish IFREDI's authority as \na center of knowledge and provider of policy inputs to, for instance, the Tonle Sap Biosphere \nReserve Secretariat, the Cambodia Development Council, the National Institute of Statistics, the \nMinistry of Planning, and the Council on Agriculture and Rural Development. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,100,000 equivalent, comprising a foreign \nexchange cost of $805,000 and a local currency cost of $295,000 equivalent. The Government \nhas requested ADB to finance $900,000 equivalent, including $785,000 in foreign exchange and \n$115,000 equivalent in local currency.17 The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA \nfunding program. The Government will finance the balance of the local currency cost, equivalent \nto $180,000, largely through the provision of office accommodation and remuneration and per \ndiem of counterpart staff. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  ADB will enter into a TA agreement with the WorldFish Center, which will implement the \nTA over 12 months. The WorldFish Center is the most qualified and competent agency to \nprovide  the  services  required  based  on  its  experience,  capacity,  and  commitment.18  The \nMekong subregion is one of the WorldFish Center\u2019s priority regions and Cambodia is one of its \npriority countries. The WorldFish Center has also implemented, with a good track record in \noutput delivery, several ADB-supported TAs. The WorldFish Center also has arrangements with \nDOF for office facilities and staff presence in Cambodia for ongoing research and training \ncollaboration with DOF. Further, the WorldFish Center will expand its collaboration with DOF \nand others in Cambodia under the Water and Food Challenge Program of the Consultative \nGroup  on  International  Agricultural  Research.  Last,  to  complement  the  TA,  the  WorldFish \nCenter will backstop capacity building of DOF and IFREDI staff and advise on the development \nof twinning arrangements between IFREDI and other research institutes.19 \n                                                 \n17 This excludes in-kind WorldFish Center financing, in the amount of $20,000. \n18 The WorldFish Center works on inland and marine fisheries in developing countries. It researches ecosystem \ndynamics; investigates alternative management schemes; analyzes policy, economic, and institutional constraints \nin fisheries and aquatic resources management; and prioritizes and improves the productivity of key fish species. \nThis entails cooperative research with institutions in developing countries and support for information and training \nin national agricultural research systems. In Cambodia, the WorldFish Center has existing collaboration \narrangements with DOF on issues dealing with institutional frameworks, livelihoods analysis, and economic \nvaluation, with support from the Department for International Development of the United Kingdom and the Swedish \nInternational Development Cooperation Agency. \n19 Twinning of institutions refers to a partnership between two institutions that provides close institutional support from \none to the other. It is recognized as a tool that provides positive results. Commonality of interests, the scope for \nexchange visits, and evolving human contacts at various organizational levels are all key ingredients. \n ", "    5 \n \n14.  The TA is expected to commence in February 2003 and to be completed by January \n2004. TA implementation will require (i) 35 person-months of international resource specialists, \nmainly in the fields of institutional development and research management, bioecology, natural \nresource and agricultural economics, computer modeling, marketing, policy development, and \nsocioeconomics; and (ii) 12 person-months of short-term domestic resource specialists, mainly \nin the fields of bioecology, natural resource and agricultural economics, socioeconomics, policy \ndevelopment,  database  management,  and  human  resource  development  and  training,  the \ncomposition and distribution of which will be determined as need arises, in consultation with \nADB. The methodology and terms of reference for the TA  are specific and clearly identified. \nHence,  ADB's  procedures  for  simplified  technical  proposals  will  be  used  as  the  basis  for \ncontract negotiation with the WorldFish Center.  The resource specialists will be engaged in \naccordance with ADB's  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The team leader, who should \nhave  qualifications  and  experience  in institutional development and research management, \nincluding organizational change, will direct their activities. The resource specialists will be based \nat IFREDI. Equipment will be procured in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for Procurement. A \nstaffing schedule is shown in Appendix 3. Terms of reference are given in Appendix 4. \n \n15.  The Executing Agency for the TA will be DOF. DOF has assigned experienced staff to \nserve on a full-time basis as counterparts to the international and domestic resource specialists, \nfor a total of 90 person-months. These counterpart staff will work to facilitate TA activities and to \nguarantee the close involvement of DOF and staff of other relevant agencies. Methodologies for \nthis purpose will be given at the WorldFish Center.  To facilitate TA implementation, DOF will \nprovide logistical support to the specialists engaged, including adequately furnished office space \nand  access  to  communications  facilities.  DOF  will  also  provide  copies  of  relevant  laws, \nregulations, policies, and reports to  the WorldFish Center and ADB, including drafts of new \nregulatory instruments. At  the WorldFish Center's headquarters, a project coordination office \nheaded  by  the  program  leader,  Policy  Research  and  Impact  Assessment  Program,  and \nincluding expertise in bioecology, socioeconomics, and policy development, will be established \nto advise on TA implementation and coordinate with ADB. At ADB, a project officer with suitable \nexpertise will be assigned to administer the TA and monitor the progress of the work. \n \n16.  The  WorldFish  Center  will  produce  (i)  an  inception  report  within  6  weeks  of  the \ncommencement of the TA; (ii) a midterm report within 20 weeks; (iii) a draft final report within 44 \nweeks; and (iv) a final report detailing TA outcomes and future actions. IFREDI will submit to \nADB (i) a semiannual report; (ii) a semiannual financial statement accounting for the use of TA \nfunds; and (iii) an audited final financial statement, not later than 6 months after TA completion. \nIFREDI will also submit to ADB a comprehensive TA completion report within 3 months of the \nend of the TA. DOF will, on its part, fill out a TA completion questionnaire to evaluate the TA's \noutputs, identify lessons learned, and suggest follow-up actions.20 \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $900,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  Cambodia  for  Capacity Building of the Inland Fisheries Research and \nDevelopment Institute, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n20 ADB  will  monitor  the  sustainability  of  TA  benefits  after  completion,  especially  the  implementation  of \nrecommendations agreed to during the TA. Further ADB assistance on a small scale and on a selective basis to \nsupport such an implementation program and to continue the partnership between ADB and IFREDI beyond TA \ncompletion could be a worthwhile initiative. \n ", "6     Appendix 1   \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \nDesign Summary  Performance  Monitoring Mechanisms  Assumptions \nIndicators/Targets  and Risks \nGoal       \nSustainable management  \u2022  Fisheries research is  \u2022  Government statistics \nand conservation of  catalyzed.  \u2022  Research program \nnatural resources and  \u2022  Systems and the  publications \nbiodiversity in the Tonle  capacity for natural  \u2022  Policy statements \nSap basin  resource  \u2022  Funding for research \nmanagement are \nenhanced. \n\u2022  Planning and \nmanagement follow \nintegrated, cross-\nsector approaches to \nthe Tonle Sap basin. \n\u2022  Stakeholders \nparticipate in decision \nmaking. \n\u2022  Rural livelihoods are \nsustained and \nimproved. \n\u2022  Policies and \ninstitutions are pro-\npoor. \nPurpose       \nTo kick-start the Inland  \u2022  IFREDI plans and  \u2022  Technical assistance  \u2022  DOF, IFREDI, and other \nFisheries Research and  undertakes research,  (TA) framework  relevant institutions have a \nDevelopment Institute  and extends and  \u2022  Final report by the  clear vision about the \n(IFREDI) as an efficient,  disseminates  WorldFish Center  sector goal to which the TA \neffective, and relevant  findings, for  \u2022  TA completion  will contribute. \nresearch and  sustainable  questionnaire filled out  \u2022  Trained counterpart staff \ndevelopment institute  management and  by the Department of  remain at IFREDI. \nconservation of  Fisheries (DOF) \ninland fisheries.  \u2022  TA completion report \nprepared by IFREDI \n\u2022  TA completion report \nprepared by the Asian \nDevelopment Bank \n(ADB)  \nOutputs       \n1.
