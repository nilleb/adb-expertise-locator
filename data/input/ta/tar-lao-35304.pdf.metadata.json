With the introduction of the New Economic Mechanism in 1986 and its implementation \nsince 1989, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (PDR) is making a transition from central \nplanning to a market-oriented economy. The Government of the Lao PDR has recognized the \nsignificance of the private sector, which encompasses domestic small and medium enterprises \n(SMEs) and foreign-invested enterprises (FIEs), for economic growth and poverty reduction, \nand requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to assist with its development. As outlined in \nthe technical assistance (TA) framework in Appendix 1, this project preparatory TA1 will design \nand prepare the Private Sector Development Program (PSDP), which is included in the 2004 \ncountry strategy and program update for the Lao PDR.2 The Fact-Finding Mission of November \n2004 reached an understanding with the Government on the TA\u2019s purpose, approach, and \nimplementation arrangements.3 \n  \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The Lao PDR has shown steady economic growth since the late 1980s, and its gross \ndomestic product (GDP) has grown by an average of 6% per year since that period. The growth \nrate for 2003 was 5.8%. The economy is still dominated by agriculture, which contributes more \nthan  half  of  GDP;  however,  the  agriculture  sector  has  been  in  decline  recently,  and \nmanufacturing (including handicraft) has been the most rapidly growing sector with growth of \nmore than 11% in 2003. The size of the state-owned enterprise sector is limited, and represents \nless than 1% of the number of firms and less than 7% of the total share of employment.4  \n \n3.  The  private  sector  consists  of  domestic  SMEs  and  larger  FIEs.  Most  domestic \nenterprises are SMEs, and estimates indicate that they account for 56% of industrial output.5 \nApproximately 22,000 SMEs account for 98% of manufacturing enterprises and more than 50% \nof  commercial  activities.  Estimates  suggest  that  more  than  80,000  SMEs  are  involved  in \nservices and trade. While the Lao PDR has only about 400 FIEs, they are the largest employer \nin the manufacturing sector, accounting for about 55% of total employment.  \n \n4.  ADB\u2019s 2004 country strategy and program update for the Lao PDR emphasizes private \nsector development (PSD) as a critical component of poverty reduction (the initial poverty and \nsocial analysis is in Appendix 2).6 The Government\u2019s Second Socioeconomic Development Plan \n(2001\u20132005)  also  states  that  economic  growth  should  be  hastened  through  strong  PSD \ncombined with poverty-reducing interventions. Although the incidence of poverty fell from about \n39% in 1998 to 32% in 2003, wide variations in poverty levels between urban and rural areas \nare likely to persist.  \n \n5.  Thus,  given  the  significance  of  both  the  domestic  SME  and  the  FIE  subsectors,  a \ncomprehensive  program  is  needed  to  support  their  development.  The  Government  has \nrecognized this and has taken a number of important steps in this regard. First, the Government \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 6 September 2004. \n2 A $10 million PSDP loan is in the pipeline for 2006. \n3  Subsequently, the TA\u2019s scope and approach was streamlined in consultation with the Government and with the \nassistance of the Lao PDR Resident Mission.  \n4  The state-owned enterprise sector is most active in utilities.  \n5  Ministry of Industry and Handicraft and United Nations Industrial Development Organization. 1999. Survey of \nIndustrial Establishments and Small-Scale Manufacturing Establishments. Vientiane. \n6  The Lao PDR has a young population with about 70% being under the age of 30, giving rise to increasing pressure \nto foster PSD for employment generation.  \n ", " 2  \nhas recently issued a decree on SME development,7 which, for the first time in the Lao PDR, \ninstalled an institutional framework for policy coordination among key Government agencies. \nSecond, the Government is also developing its financial sector, supported by World Bank, \nInternational  Monetary  Fund,  and  ADB  (particularly  by  ADB\u2019s  Banking  Sector  Reform \nProgram).8 Finally, in recognition that the Multi-Fibre Agreement will soon be phased out, the \nGovernment is actively participating in globalization and regionalization through the Free Trade \nAgreement  of  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations,  accession  to  the  World  Trade \nOrganization, and various cooperation projects in the Mekong region.  \n \n6.  Furthermore, external funding agencies have been involved in a number of important \nPSD projects in the Lao PDR. The major aid agencies active include the Japan International \nCooperation Agency, which has provided assistance with formulating economic policy, and the \nUnited Nations Industrial Development Organization, which helped the Government draft the \nSME  decree.  The  European  Union  and  the  Deutsche  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Technische \nZusammenarbeit (German Technical Cooperation) are currently formulating activities in the \nSME  sector,  particularly  in  relation  to  export  promotion  and  training.  The  Mekong  Project \nDevelopment Facility provides enterprises with a business development service (BDS). The \nSwedish International Development Agency has initiated project activity on enterprise taxation. \nIn addition, a number of credit lines support SMEs\u2019 access to finance. According to a 2003 \nmicrofinance survey by the United Nations Development Programme, the Bank of the Lao PDR \n(the central bank) and credit lines provided by donor agencies account for 64.6% of total \nliabilities  and  capital  for  state-owned  commercial  banks.  In  the  case  of  the  Agricultural \nPromotion Bank, these two sources account for 92.4% of liabilities and capital. However, no \nagency has yet provided a comprehensive policy reform program combined with TA directly \ntargeting  PSD.  To  ensure  an  integrated  and  incremental  approach  toward  PSD,  active \nconsultation with other external funding agencies is called for throughout TA implementation.  \n \n7.  Despite recent progress and activities, considerable efforts are needed to develop a \nmore  enabling  environment  for  PSD.  Overall,  the  Lao  PDR  still  has  a  limited  legal  and \ninstitutional framework, which prohibits the development of a conducive business environment, \nand the costs of doing business continue to be high. Domestic enterprises remain small in size, \naveraging only two paid employees. While FIEs play an important role in the economy, inflows \nof foreign direct investment have been slowing down, falling from 8% of GDP in 1996\u20131997 \n(approximately  $105  million)  to  4%  of  GDP  in  2000\u20132001  (approximately  $70  million). \nAccordingly, the current business environment needs to be reformed to enhance the growth of \ndomestic enterprises and facilitate a more active inflow of foreign investment. The specific \nchallenges include the following:  \n \n(i)  Constrained  regulatory  environment.  The  existing  legal,  regulatory,  and \nadministrative environment is not favorable to the start-up and growth of private \nenterprises. For instance, the process for registering and licensing a business is \nextremely burdensome and complicated, with limited mechanisms for providing \ninformation  to  the  public. 9  The  problems  associated  with  the  regulatory \nenvironment are compounded by significant gaps in the legal framework. Even \nthough the Government is currently engaged in drafting major commercial laws, \n                                                 \n7  The Prime Minister\u2019s Office issued the  Decree on the Promotion  and  Development of Small  and Medium \nEnterprises (No. 42/PO) in April 2004.  \n8  ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Loan to the Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic for the Banking Sector Reform Program. Manila. \n9  For example, a World Bank survey indicates that for enterprises to register and receive operating licenses could \ntake up to 1 year. ", "    3\nincluding a business law, considerable efforts are needed to develop an effective, \nenabling legal framework. Finally, particularly for SMEs, the current lump-sum \n(negotiated) tax system encourages enterprises to remain informal and provides \ndisincentives for the proper maintenance of financial records.  \n(ii)  Limited access to finance. As only about 4% of private enterprises have access \nto bank financing, their access to finance needs to be enhanced. Because of the \nsmall size of private enterprises, commercial banks view them as potentially risky \nborrowers,  accounting  for  their  limited  access  to  finance.  The  lack  of  fully \nfunctioning  systems  for  secured  transactions  and  other  means  to  secure \ncollateral,10 along with the limited enforcement of security rights by the newly \ndeveloping court system, heighten the risky lending environment for financial \ninstitutions.  \n(iii)  Continued barriers to foreign investment and trade. While the FIE sector is \nsignificant, the inflow of foreign investment has recently decreased. Although \nmany  factors  have  contributed  to  this,  one  of  the  main  concerns  is  the \ncomplicated procedures pertaining to both foreign investment and trade. The \nGovernment  still  restricts  the  inflow  of  investment  in  certain  industries,  and \nimports  (as  key  inputs  for  industrial  development11)  still  face  a  number  of \nrestrictions, including non-tariff trade barriers. \n(iv)  Limited public-private partnerships for BDSs. Even though the Lao National \nChamber of Commerce and Industry has been active in representing the private \nsector\u2019s  interests,  there  is a  continued  need  for  formulating  mechanisms  for \npromoting public-private partnership to (a) provide enterprises with information \non market access and regulations; (b) develop private policy advocacy; and (c) \nfoster the development of a BDS industry, which is currently extremely limited.  \n \n8.  In sum, while the Lao PDR has made considerable progress recently, sustainable PSD \nrequires a number of actions that, in turn, should contribute significantly to poverty reduction \nand economic growth. Overall, developing an appropriate legal and institutional framework is \nconsidered as the most important priority for the Government in relation to facilitating PSD.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n9.  The purpose of the TA is to prepare the PSDP by formulating a focused and sequenced \npolicy reform framework to establish the foundation for PSD. The framework will be consistent \nwith and supplementary to the Government\u2019s overall development strategies, and will include \nthe following components: \n \n(i)  Enhancing the regulatory environment for PSD. The TA will analyze the major \nregulations and legal framework affecting the private sector and formulate a \nspecific reform agenda. The major areas to be targeted include (a) business \nregistration and licensing; (b) major legal documents affecting the private sector, \nincluding the business law and the SME decree; and (c) specific mechanisms for \n                                                 \n10 Accordingly, the TA will also analyze key issues related to property rights, addressing usufruct rights and common \nproperty  resources.  Furthermore,  the  TA  will  also  review  key  regulatory  frameworks  pertaining  to  land \nadministration, resettlement, and indigenous peoples\u2019 rights.  \n11  A survey by ADB in 2002 reported that almost 90% of manufacturing firms import at least some of their materials \nfrom overseas and that almost 70% of firms import more than half of their inputs. This implies that restricting \nimports has negative consequences on the country\u2019s manufactured outputs and exports.  \n ", " 4  \nproviding pertinent information to the public. The overall aim is to enhance the \ncurrent regulatory and legal environment through improved transparency and \ngood governance.  \n(ii)  Enhancing private enterprises\u2019 access to finance. The TA will undertake an \nin-depth  analysis  to  develop  a  series  of  measures  for  reducing  the  risks \nassociated  with  lending.  This  includes  complementing  ongoing  efforts \n(particularly the Banking Sector Reform Program) aimed at secured transactions \nand secured rights of property and collateral. As requested by the Government, \nthe  TA  will  also  examine  new  funding  mechanisms  for  SMEs  through  the \nproposed  SME  Access  Fund.  In  addition,  in  close  coordination  with  the \nGovernment and other stakeholders, including external funding agencies, the TA \nwill continue to analyze the impact of the current tax regime on small businesses. \n(iii)  Facilitating foreign investment and trade. In assisting the Lao PDR with its \naccession  into  the  World  Trade  Organization,  the  TA  will  identify  specific \nmeasures for facilitating more active foreign investment and trade. It will build on \nongoing  efforts  to  enhance  investment  procedures  and  facilitate  reforms  in \nrelation to the importation of foreign goods as a way to boost the export-oriented \nmanufacturing sector.  \n(iv)  Promoting public-Private partnerships and BDSs. The TA will continue the \nefforts of recent ADB operations12 to foster the capacity-building efforts of such \nprivate business associations as the Lao National Chamber of Commerce and \nIndustry and develop specific measures that would help them play a larger role in \npolicy advocacy. Furthermore, the TA will also identify ways in which the BDS \nindustry can become more active and more accessible to private enterprises.  \n \n10.  Detailed analysis of the issues identified will support formulation of the PSDP. The \nPSDP will aim to develop an enabling environment in the Lao PDR and will provide, to the \nextent possible, on the reform agenda of the PSDP to the Government. Accordingly, the TA will \ninclude measures for Government capacity building, which will be formulated and undertaken \nthroughout TA implementation. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The  TA  will  proceed  in  two  phases.  During  the  first  phase  (3  months),  the  PSDP \nframework will be formulated, and during the second phase (4 months), consensus will be built. \nDuring the second phase, the TA will also engage in capacity-building activities pertinent to the \nidentified reform agenda. To achieve the goals of the first phase, the TA will undertake the \nfollowing: (i) an in-depth diagnostic analysis of the key issues facing the private sector, (ii) a \ndetailed draft of the framework for PSD, and (iii) the identification of an overall framework for the \nPSDP. \n \n12.  Based on the achievements of the first phase, the frameworks for PSD and the PSDP \nwill be refined throughout the second phase in consultation with the Government and other \nstakeholders. As each step of the TA will require close consultation with stakeholders, several \n                                                 \n12  The major related projects include ADB. 2003.

The major activities of this TA \nincluded (i) training judges in commercial adjudication and dispute resolution procedures, (ii) reviewing incentives \nfor foreign investment, and (iii) continuing to build capacity to harmonize registration processes for enterprises \nacross the Government.   ", "    5\nparticipatory  workshops  will  be  organized  and  other  opportunities  will  be  offered  to  build \nconsensus on the outputs.13 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA will be financed on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the \nGovernment of Japan. The TA is estimated to cost $850,000 equivalent, comprising a foreign \nexchange cost of $645,000 and a local currency cost of $205,000 equivalent. The Government \nhas asked ADB to finance $700,000 equivalent to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and \n$55,000 equivalent of the local currency costs. The Government will finance the remaining \n$150,000 equivalent of the local currency costs, including by providing counterpart staff, office \nspace, administrative services, and physical facilities. The cost estimate and financing plan is \nshown in Appendix 3. The Government has also been advised that approval of the TA does not \ncommit ADB to financing any ensuing program.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The Ministry of Industry and Handicraft will be the executing agency. ADB has also \nrequested  that  a  high-level  task  force  be  established  headed  by  the  Ministry  to  oversee \nimplementation  of  the  TA.  Implementing  agencies  include  Ministry  of  Finance,  Ministry  of \nCommerce, Department for Domestic and Foreign Investment of the Committee for Planning \nand  Investment,  and  other  relevant  Government  agencies.  Inputs  from  private  sector \nrepresentatives, including business associations, as well as from other stakeholders, will be \nsought throughout TA implementation. \n \n15.  The TA will be implemented over 8 months, from April to December 2005, and will \nrequire  four  international  and  four  domestic  (19  person-months  each)  consultants.  For the \ninternational consultants, an SME and regulatory specialist, a finance specialist, an investment \nand trade specialist, and a BDS and market access development specialist will be recruited. \nThe  requirements  for  domestic  consultants  will  be  the  same  as  those  for  international \nconsultants. The consultant team will produce an inception report, two interim reports, and a \ndraft final report, and each will be discussed during tripartite meetings. The consultant team will \nbe selected according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of consultants. A firm will be recruited and the contract \nwith the consulting firm will be based on quality- and cost-based selection. The simplified \ntechnical proposal will be used. All procurement under the TA will be in accordance with ADB's \nGuidelines for Procurement. The terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 4.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $700,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for Preparing the Private Sector \nDevelopment Program, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n13 In formulating the PSDP, the TA will also use inputs from ADB\u2019s private sector assessment of the Lao PDR and the \ninvestment climate survey of the Lao PDR, to be undertaken jointly by the World Bank and ADB.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nPRELIMARY PROGRAM FRAMEWORK \n  \nPerformance  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Indicators and Targets  Monitoring Mechanisms  and Risks \nGoal  \u2022 Increased

The technical \nassistance (TA) is expected to formulate a program that will help increase private enterprises\u2019 contribution to economic \ngrowth, employment generation, and poverty reduction. This will be achieved through the creation of a more \nconducive  business  environment  by  (i)  improving  the  commercial  legal  framework,  (ii)  minimizing  regulatory \nrequirements, (iii) enhancing access to finance, and (iv) liberalizing trade and investment regimes. In the medium to \nlong term, the TA and the ensuing program are expected to significantly increase opportunities for employment and \nreduce the incidence of poverty.

The Asian Development Bank has played an active role in \nthe  strategy  formulation  process  through  various  initiatives,  and  the  strategy  emphasizes  regional  economic \nintegration,  market-based  development  initiatives,  human  resource  development,  and  sustainable  social  and \nenvironmental management. In line with the priorities set forth in the strategy, the TA aims to address some of the \nstructural policy and legal and regulatory impediments to private sector development. Identified priorities include the \nfollowing: (i) enhancing the legal and regulatory environment for private sector development, (ii) enhancing private \nenterprises\u2019  access  to  finance,  (iii)  facilitating  foreign  investment  and  trade,  and  (iv)  promoting  public-private \npartnerships.  \n \nThe establishment of transparent, market-friendly, socially inclusive, and, to the extent possible, gender-responsive \nbusiness practices is also likely to promote private sector confidence and contribute to the establishment of pro-poor \ngovernance structures.
