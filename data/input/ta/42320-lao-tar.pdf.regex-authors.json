During the 2008 Country Program Confirmation Mission of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB), the Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) requested technical \nassistance (TA) for preparing the Small to Mini Hydroelectric Development Project. 1 The ADB \nFact-Finding  Mission  visited  Lao  PDR  from  4  to  12  September  2008  and  reached  an \nunderstanding  with  the  Ministry  of  Energy  and  Mines  (MEM)  on  the  purpose,  scope, \nimplementation arrangements, cost estimates, financing arrangements, and terms of reference \nfor consultants. The TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Lao PDR is among the poorest countries in Asia with a per capita income of $810 in \nFY2007. With domestic sales of 1.30 terawatt-hours (TWh) in 2007, the per capita consumption \nof electricity was about 223 kWh/year. The country has abundant natural resources, including \nhydropower. Large hydropower development projects are being implemented to export electricity \nthat will allow Lao PDR to earn much-needed foreign exchange. To date, about 672 MW of \nhydropower exist for export and domestic consumption,2 and 2,100 MW are under construction \nmainly for export. Electricit\u00e9 du Laos (EdL) has developed a 115 kV transmission backbone \nsystem linking three hydropower plants in central Laos totaling 255 MW with population centers \nin northern and central Laos. In 2006, the length of this backbone was 1,498 km. The system is \nnow being extended to include also central and southern Laos. ADB has long supported the \nexpansion of this transmission system, currently through the ongoing Loan 2005-LAO: Northern \nArea Rural Power Distribution Project, and is preparing a follow-up project for 2009 approval \n(GMS Northern Power Transmission Project). These transmission lines link the main population \ncenters, and provide power to communities within a certain distance to either side of the line.3 \nExpansion to more remote areas is slow due to high cost in difficult terrain and availability of \nfunds within EdL. \n \n3.  Only 56%  of the country\u2019s households were electrified in 2006,4 and only 38% are \nconnected to the main grid operated by EdL. About 99 villages that were not connected to the \nEdL grid were connected to small and mini hydropower plants with an installed capacity totaling \nabout 7.6 MW. In 2006, there were still 5,289 villages (about 50% of the national total) with more \nthan 2.6 million people without access to electricity. Assuming the provincial average household \nconsumption in 2006, the demand in those villages not yet electrified would correspond to about \n375 GWh (equivalent to an installation of about 110 MW). These villages are generally in remote \nmountainous locations with difficult access, and provision of electricity from local renewable \nenergy sources (especially hydropower and solar) may be the only viable option. Laos is well \nendowed with streams and the country\u2019s topography is conducive to hydropower development.  \n \n4.  Lack of a reliable, affordable and safe access to electricity affect poor rural communities \nby  among  others:  (i) causing  social  and  economic  poverty,  including  lack  of  education \nopportunities and worsening health standards; (ii) degrading water supplies and causing flash \nfloods and erosion as forests are degraded when villagers use firewood for their energy needs; \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 24 September 2008 \n2  In addition there are about 42 diesel-fuelled generating power plants with a total installed capacity exceeding 9 MW, \nand 237 villages with solar photovoltaic power systems with installed capacity of 296 kW. \n3  With about 6.5 million inhabitants and an area of about 236,000 km2, the average population density is about 25 \ninhabitants/km2. Mountainous provinces have low population densities with as low as 9.8 inh/km2 in Phongsaly. \n4  The electrification of households varies from 96% in Vientiane Capital to 9% in Phongsaly Province. Eight of 140 \ndistricts in Laos remain completely unelectrified in Phongsaly, Bokeo, Bolikhamxay and Attapeu.  \n ", "2   \nand (iii) maintaining a stagnant rural economy since value-added industry cannot be supported. \nAccess  to  energy  is  a  prerequisite  for  sustainable  development  and  for  fighting  poverty. \nProviding affordable and sustainable renewable energy in rural areas would: (i) allow for income \ngenerating productive activities in farms by freeing time otherwise spent for fuel and water \ngathering, and food grinding; (ii) improve education by allowing more time for studying, powering \ninformation and communication technologies, including distance learning; (iii) improve health by \nreducing  indoor  pollution  and  by  improving  refrigeration  and  powering  of  modern  health \nequipment; and (iv) reduce CO  emission caused by use of fossil fuel for power generation, \n2\ndeforestation, land degradation and pollution. Appendix 2 shows the Initial Poverty and Social \nAnalysis.  \n \n5.  Ownership  of  private  or  communal  pico  hydropower-generating  sets  reflects  the \nimportance of electricity in village life. In a 2006 census, provincial authorities reported existence \nof pico hydropower plants in their province, indicating on average about 22% of villages had \ninstalled such devices. Easily available pico-hydro generating sets for about $50-$100 each \nprovide poor quality electric power, and are generally dangerous to operate. There is therefore a \nneed  to  continue  developing  environmentally  friendly,  affordable,  safe  and  sustainable \ngenerating facilities to provide electricity to those in remote areas without electric power and \nrelying on fire wood for their energy needs; or are provided with electricity generated by local \ndiesel generators5 and use kerosene for lightning; or are supplied with electricity imported from \nneighboring countries6 produced using fossil fuels.7 EdL and private developers have identified \nabout 95-100 small and mini8 environmentally benign hydropower projects totaling about 120 \nMW  to  140 MW  in  13  of  Lao  PDR\u2019s  18  provinces.9 Promoting  small-scale  hydropower \ndevelopment is a priority to the Government of Lao PDR as (i) solar panels are expensive and \nmore suitable for lighting of houses; (ii) use of biomass is less known in Lao PDR and the \ntechnology is not developed locally; (iii) unsuitability of wind power due to absence of all year \nwinds; and (iv) the ability of small and mini hydropower plants to provide electricity also to small \nindustries and enterprises.  \n \n6.  Small and mini hydroelectric power plants generally have higher generation costs than \nlarge scale hydro, which benefits from economies of scale. Present tariff regulations in Lao PDR \nnow hinder the development of small hydro. The MEM has prepared an amendment to the \nElectricity Law to, among other things, encourage small to mini hydropower development for \ndomestic power supply. The amended Energy Law is expected to be discussed and approved \nby the National Assembly in December 2008. There will thereafter be a need for a policy dealing \nwith development of small hydropower, and identification of what measures need to be taken to \nencourage interested public and private developers of small hydropower plants. There will also \nbe a need to prepare the necessary implementing guidelines that will allow EdL to purchase \nelectricity at higher cost from such small developers.  \n                                                 \n5  Reduction greenhouse gas emissions can go up to 12,800-28,000 tCO /year if mini-hydro projects totally displace \n2\ndiesel power plants. \n6  In 2006, Lao PDR imported about 340 GWh to 11 provinces from PRC (4.9 GWh), Thailand (317 GWh), and Viet \nNam (18 GWh). \n7   The greenhouse emission factor for Thailand has averaged 0.515 for its CDM projects. If Lao PDR can reduce its \nannual electricity import from Thailand by 16-35 GWh, then some 8,200-18,000 tCO /year can be avoided. \n2\n8  Hydropower projects are classified in Lao PDR as small for sizes between 5 MW and 50 MW, mini (100 to \n5,000 kW), micro (5 to 100 kW) and pico (<5 kW). Provincial authorities can approve projects when the installed is \ncapacity is less than 2 MW; and district authorities when capacity is less than 100 kW. The National Assembly \napproves projects larger than 50 MW, and the remaining by the Government. \n9  Two private sector developers are in the advanced stage of developing small hydropower: Nam Sim (8 MW) in \nHouaphan Province, Nam Nhone (2.4 MW) in Bokeo Province; and five developers (for projects totaling 12.2 MW in \ninstalled capacity) are conducting feasibility studies. \n ", "  3\n \n7.  Small  hydropower  plants  have  a  potential  to  displace  carbon  emissions  from  other \ncarbon-based  energy  sources  as  mentioned  in  paragraph  5.  Due  to  the  relatively  high \ntransaction cost of registering projects under the Clean Development Mechanism, there is a \nneed  to  standardize  the  documentation,  methodologies,  greenhouse  emission  factors,  and \nprocedures  within  Lao  PDR,  so  that  developers  of  small  hydropower  plants  of  similar \ncharacteristics prepare similar documentation for submission to the United Nation Framework on \nClimate  Change  (UNFCC).  This  would  reduce  transaction  costs,  would  make  it  easier  for \nUNFCC to evaluate proposals coming from Lao PDR, and would reduce transaction costs. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n8.  The  Project  proposes  to  assist  the  MEM  in  (i)  preparing  a  policy  for  implementing  \nsections of the amended Electricity Law related to tariff setting, to encourage development of \nmedium to mini hydroelectric power projects to provide electricity from a clean and renewable \nsource of energy for domestic use, and to allow the Government to approve such development \nproposals; (ii) after screening and ranking identified projects, prepare a feasibility study of one or \ntwo small or mini hydropower (with an installed capacity of up to 5 MW each) projects that would \nbenefit  from  the  work  under  (i);  and  (iii) preparing  the  necessary  documentation  for  Clean \nDevelopment Mechanism (CDM) registration that would serve as a model for replication by other \nsmall-scale hydroelectric power project developments. This is in line with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020 \nand the country strategy and program for Lao PDR, which encourages the development of \nenvironmentally friendly generating facilities to tackle climate change and promote clean energy, \nand is also consistent with the Government\u2019s energy sector plan to provide electricity to 90% of \nthe population by 2020, and EdL\u2019s energy strategy and road map on power generation. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The impact of the project will be for private and public sector to provide clean and \nrenewable electricity generated at medium, small, and mini hydroelectric power plants to rural \ncommunities in remote areas. The outcome of the project will be a project design, with CDM \nregistration, of the hydroelectric power plants that the Government of Lao PDR and ADB will \nagree upon to be used as model for further replication at other small-scale hydropower projects. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The TA project will have three outputs: \n \nOutput (i):   Policy  Paper:  to  assist  the  MEM  prepare  a  policy  to  encourage \ndevelopment  of  medium  to  mini  public  and  private  sector  hydroelectric \npower projects to provide electricity from a clean and renewable source of \nenergy for domestic use, and to allow the Government to approve such \ndevelopment proposals; \nOutput (ii):   Feasibility Study: that will, subsequent to a screening and ranking process \nof identified projects, prepare a feasibility study of one or two off-grid or grid-\nconnected small or mini hydropower (with an installed capacity of up to \n5 MW each) projects that would benefit from the work under Output 1; and  \nOutput (iii):   Model CDM Project Design Document (PDD): will assist the Government \nprepare the necessary documentation for CDM registration that would serve \nas  a  model  for  replication  by  other  medium,  small  and  mini-scale \nhydroelectric power project development. \n ", "4   \n \n11.  The TA will: (i) Review the revised Electricity Law and then prepare a policy document \nthat allows the MEM to give incentives to developers of medium to mini hydroelectric power \nplants; (ii) Review existing master plans and feasibility reports for small hydroelectric power \nplants in Lao PDR, and prepare a ranking list of grid-connected and off-grid hydropower projects \nusing criteria proposed by the consultants in the Interim Report and to be agreed upon at a \nsubsequent tripartite meeting; (iii) Based on the ranking list, prepare the technical design to \nfeasibility  level  for  up  to  two  small  and  mini  hydroelectric  power  plants  (including  MV \ntransmission  line,  if  grid  connected),  cost  estimates,  procurement  plan  and  implementation \nschedule, and operation and maintenance arrangements for the power facilities; (iv) Assess \nsales tariff to the grid based on the investment, depreciation and amount of energy to be \ntransmit; (v) Carry out an economic and financial analysis of the Project; (vi) Carry out the \nenvironmental and social assessment of the Project and safeguard planning for involuntary \nresettlement, ethnic minorities and environment as appropriate in accordance with ADB policies \nand guidelines on environmental assessments and resettlement; and (vii) Based on the results \nof the feasibility study, prepare the PDD required for CDM registration.   \n \n12.  Since the location of a good hydropower plant may be located at a distance from a \ndemand center that could consume its potential generation, the study will also consider financing \na medium voltage transmission line to the nearest large demand center or the EdL gird. The TA \nwill undertake a financial analysis from EdL\u2019s point of view and will recommend the overall level \nof sales tariff to EdL. The PPTA will update EdL financial projections.  \n \n13.  The  registration  of  CDM  of  the  chosen  hydroelectric  power  project  will  only  be \nrequested after feasibility has been carried out and subject to loan approval. However, the \nprocedures for preparing the necessary documents (e.g. PDD) will be done at the completion of \nthe feasibility study, and in coordination with Water Resources and Environment Administration \n(WREA). The PDD, with CDM registration, of the hydroelectric power plants will be used as \nmodel for further replication at other small-scale hydropower projects. As part of this outcome, \nCDM capacity building will be given to EdL and MEM. \n \n14.  Change in land use within catchments area represents a risk to the sustainability of \nhydroelectric  projects.  The  TA  will  develop  if  required  a  community  based  catchments \nmanagement  model  appropriate  for  the  selected  power  plant  for  implementation  during \nconstruction and operation to mitigate this risk, and in close cooperation with the ADB-financed \nNam Ngum River Basin Development Project, if the selected project is in that river basin. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.   The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,175,000 equivalent. The Government of \nFinland10 will provide a grant of $1,000,000 to be administered by the Asian Development Bank. \nThe Government will finance, in kind, the remaining local currency cost of $175,000 equivalent \nin the form of office accommodation, site transportation, and counterpart staff. The detailed cost \nestimates are presented in Appendix 3. The Government has been advised that approval of the \nTA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing investment project. \n \n                                                 \n10  Financed through the Channel Financing Agreement (Technical Assistance Program) between the Government of \nFinland and the Asian Development Bank. \n ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  MEM will be the Executing Agency. A senior MEM staff member will be appointed as TA \ndirector. The Department of Electricity will be the implementing agency for Outputs (i) and (iii), \nwhile EdL will be the implementing agency for Output (ii). EdL will also facilitate the processing \nof the ensuing loan. The TA will be implemented over 12 months, from March 2009 to February \n2010.  \n \n17.

POVERTY ISSUES \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \nADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program (CSP) for Lao PDR (2007-2011) focus on supporting pro-poor economic \ngrowth, social equity and balanced development, and sustainable environment management. One of the key \nchallenges for poverty reduction in Lao PDR\u2019s Socio-economic Development Program, 2006-2010 (SEDP) is to \nprovide the basic services and infrastructure needed to ensure the access to markets needed to attract private \ninvestment and create jobs. ADB country strategy is aimed at reducing the poverty through promoting pro-poor, \nbusiness-led economic growth. Provision of basic infrastructure is one of the prerequisites for such development. \nIn 2006, 56% of households in Lao PDR had access to electricity. The government is extending the grid system \nbut this is proving to be slow in mountainous provinces due to difficult access resulting in high costs. Those \nremaining to be connected are districts in remote mountains, often inhabited by indigenous people with 18% of \nthe population below the national poverty line (against 22% for the whole country). The Project will contribute to \nachieving this objective of ensuring 90% electrification of villages and households by 2020. The proposed project \nwill help in achieving this goal, and thus, contributes to the government goal of promoting pro-poor and balanced \neconomic development of remote and isolated mountainous districts through sustainable use of renewable \nenergy. \n \nIn remote mountainous poor districts when electricity is available, it is mainly used for household purposes such \nas lighting. There is little scope for the productive use of energy; however the Project will promote a special \nfeature to support such productive use of energy. The Project will provide reliable and affordable supply of \nelectricity to remote poor districts by implementing a small or mini hydroelectric power plant and associated \ntransmission and distribution facilities. The Project will thus contribute to inclusive social development and to a \nlesser extent to pro-poor growth (through some additional potential for income generation of poor remote \ncommunities through productive use of electricity) as well as to environmental sustainability (through promoting \nrenewable energy sources). \n \nB.

Select the targeting classification of the project: \n \n General Intervention    Individual or Household (TI-H);   Geographic (TI-G);  Non-Income MDGs (TI-M1, \n  M2, etc.) \n \nThe Project will be in areas with poverty incidence substantially above the national average. While it is not specifically \ntargeted to individual poor households, as it will provide access to electricity to all the households in the remote \ncommunes within the 47 poorest districts identified by the Government. Besides making indirect impact on income \npoverty, the project\u2019s major feature is improving livings standards of poor households. It is therefore classified as an \nintervention that targets geographical dimensions of poverty (TI-G). \n \nC.  Poverty Analysis \n1.  If the project is classified as TI-H, or if it is policy-based, what type of poverty impact analysis is needed?  \n \nThe Project will not specifically address income-poverty at the household level. While it will have a small component \nof promoting the productive use of energy, thereby contributing to perhaps increased income potential for some poor \nfamilies, the main feature will be improving the livings standard of all in a geographical area where majority of the \npopulation are poor.  \n \nDuring Project preparation, a social and poverty impact analysis study will be done, including assessment of impact \non ethnic minorities.   \n \n2.  What resources are allocated in the PPTA/due diligence? \n \nA social and poverty expert team will prepare a socio-economic analysis in remote mountainous districts divided \n ", "                            Appendix 2  9\ninto following sub tasks:  \n\u2022  Socio-economic profile of the households in the pilot sub projects. \n\u2022  People\u2019s income and ability to pay, affordability analysis and recommendations for targeted subsidies to \nensure poor households benefiting from the Project. \n\u2022  Estimate on use of electricity and recommendations for enhancing productive use of electricity. \n\u2022  Impact of electricity on changing life, analysis of potential positive and negative effects. \n\u2022  Ethnic minority assessment; Ethnic Minority Framework for the sector project and Ethnic Minority Development \nPlan for the sub projects in ethnic minority dominated areas.  \n\u2022  HIV/AIDS and human trafficking risk assessment and recommendations for risk reduction. \n\u2022  Gender assessment and gender strategy. \n\u2022  Stakeholder analysis, participation and consultation strategy. \nMethodology used will include statistical reports, household surveys, and interviews with different stakeholder \ncategories individually and in groups such as men and women, people earning income from different type of \nproduction activities, small business owners, education and healthcare providers, local administration, and regional \ndevelopment authorities. \n \n2.  If GI, is there any opportunity for pro-poor design (e.g., social inclusion subcomponents, cross subsidy, pro-\npoor governance, and pro-poor growth)? \n \n     The Project is classified as a TI-G. It has pro-poor design features and supported an affordability analysis, \nleading to recommended targeted subsidies to enhance poor households\u2019  access  and long-term use of \nelectricity. \n \nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \nA.  Initial Social Analysis \nBased on existing information: \n1.  Who are the potential primary beneficiaries of the project? How do the poor and the socially excluded benefit \nfrom the project? \n \n\u2022  Primary beneficiaries will be households (majority of which being poor), small enterprises and public service \nproviders in poor and remote communities. Project guidelines and recommendations will be targeted to \nenhance poor households\u2019 access to and long-term use of electricity. The project will provide awareness \nraising campaign on safe use and conservation of electricity, and the Project will prepare a program for \nelectricity use for income generation activities through appropriate micro-credit facilities. \n \n2.  What are the potential needs of beneficiaries in relation to the proposed project? \n \nTo get sustainable access to electricity at an affordable price in the long term for household use and for \ndevelopment of income generation activities. Subsidized prices for connection and electricity consumption may be \nneeded, as well as special features (one of them could be micro-credit) for income generation development. \n \n3.  What are the potential constraints in accessing the proposed benefits and services, and how will the project \naddress them?  \n \nElectricity prices may in the long run constitute an obstacle for poor households\u2019 electricity use. Affordability \nanalysis of households\u2019 ability to pay for electricity and recommendations for targeted subsidies are expected to \nmitigate the risk of poor  households  not  benefiting from the electrification  potential. The analysis  will help \nrationalizing the subsidy component for the off-grid connection. \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1. Indicate the potential initial stakeholders.  \n \n    Local households, local small entrepreneurs, local government offices, local public service providers (primarily \neducation and healthcare sectors, and agricultural extension centre), district and province authorities responsible \nfor the sub-sector and for regional development. \n ", "1  0  Appendix 2 \n   \n   \n2.   What type of consultation and participation (C&P) is required during the PPTA or project processing (e.g., \nworkshops,  community  mobilization,  involvement  of  non-government  organizations  and  community-based \norganizations, etc.)? \n \nInterviews and focus group meetings with households \u2013 men and women \u2013 from different wealth categories and \nincome  generation  activity  sectors,  interviews  and  focus  group  meetings  with  local  entrepreneurs,  service \nproviders, government officials, representatives for mass organizations, interviews with regional (province and \ndistrict) authorities. \n \n3.

What are the key gender issues in the sector/subsector that are likely to be relevant to this project/program?  \n \nEqual  access  of  men  and  women  to  the  benefits  of  electrification  and  the  improved  income  generation \nprerequisites; risk of loss of manual labor opportunities; some (minor) risk of sexual exploitation and spread of \nSTDs and HIV during the construction period. \n \n2.  Does the proposed project/program have the potential to promote gender equality and/or women\u2019s \nempowerment by improving women\u2019s access to and use of opportunities, services, resources, assets, and \nparticipation in decision making?   \n \n  Yes          No    Please explain \n \n       Energy will be provided to households not to individual people. As such both men and women will benefit. The \nuse of electricity in public places will enhance comfort and security in the area which will particularly benefit \nwomen. The electricity will particularly be used for living room and kitchen lights. Especially the later will reduce \nexposure of women to fume from candle light (some health and comfort impact). The Project will have however \nlittle impact on income potential because of the limited productive use of electricity and the use of electricity in \nareas where women may not find major employment opportunities. Further information on the benefits for men \nand women and how such project could impact on gender relations will be prepared during the Project \npreparation.  \n \n3. Could the proposed project have an adverse impact on women and/or girls or to widen gender inequality?         \n      \n     Yes          No    Please explain  \n \n       Gender strategy prepared during the Project preparation will include recommendations and measures to \nmitigate the potential adverse impacts of loss of work opportunities of women and potential (relatively minor) \ngender-related risks of sexual exploitation during the construction period. \nIII.
