THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Kingdom of Tonga for the Integrated Urban Resilience Sector Project. \n \n2.  The project will provide high-priority urban infrastructure identified in the Tonga National \nInfrastructure Investment Plan,1 expanding on infrastructure development being undertaken in \nNuku\u2019alofa  through  the  ongoing  Nuku\u2019alofa  Urban  Development  Sector  Project  (NUDSP),2 \nenhancing the delivery of  public urban services, and building climate change and disaster \nresilience. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Urban growth and development pressure. Tonga\u2019s total population is estimated at \n100,651.3 Nearly three-quarters of Tonga\u2019s population resides on the main island of Tongatapu, \nand 80% of the island\u2019s population and infrastructure are located in low-lying coastal areas. This \nincludes the capital, Nuku\u2019alofa. The greater Nuku\u2019alofa area comprises 6,134 households with a \ntotal population of 35,184, and this is forecasted to grow to 45,000 (or about 40% of Tonga's \n   \npopulation) by 2030. Migration to Nuku\u2019alofa from Tonga's outer islands is significant.4 Urban \ngrowth in Tonga is a relatively recent phenomenon and has not been matched by the provision \nor improvement in the delivery of urban services. Living conditions for many of Nuku\u2019alofa\u2019s \nresidents are deteriorating and demand for improved urban infrastructure is increasing. Sustained \nurban growth has put pressure on the availability of urban land. Expansion in the capital is limited \nby peripheral agricultural and ecologically sensitive areas, placing development pressure on \nexisting marginal areas. Some of these areas are below high tide levels and therefore experience \nfrequent coastal inundation. \n \n4.  Climate change and natural hazards. Natural hazards and climate change pose a \nsignificant threat to Tonga. The archipelagic country is located in the Pacific cyclone belt and \nintense seismic activity also occurs. In addition, most of its atoll islands are very flat, with an \naverage height of 2\u20135 meters above sea level. As a result, Tonga\u2014and Nuku\u2019alofa\u2014are highly \nexposed  to  sea-level  rise,  storm  surge,  and  tsunami  inundation.  Critical  infrastructure  and \nservices and more than 10,000 buildings are located in low-lying Nuku\u2019alofa. Consequently, the \nentire country\u2019s economic and operational vulnerability to natural hazards, such as tsunami, \nfloods, and cyclones, is extreme. The World Risk Report points out that, despite the growth in \nTonga\u2019s income and development level, the country\u2019s vulnerability to natural hazards has not \ndecreased.5 In fact, all vulnerability indicators increased slightly during 2012\u20132016. \n \n5.  Susceptibility to flooding. Rain-fed floods have affected Nuku\u2019alofa\u2019s urban area more \nthan any other type of natural hazards in terms of frequency and number of people impacted. \nTropical cyclones and storm surges frequently force hundreds of households be relocated to \ncommunity evacuation centers as their houses are submerged in flood. There is high certainty \nthat the frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall events will increase due to climate change, \n                                                \n1  Government of Tonga. 2013. Tonga National Infrastructure Investment Plan. Nuku\u2019alofa. Supported by the Pacific \nRegion Infrastructure Facility. \n2  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2011. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: \nProposed Asian Development Fund Grant and Administration of Grant to the Kingdom of Tonga for the Nuku\u2019alofa \nUrban Development Sector Project. Manila. The project is ongoing). \n3 Tonga National Population and Housing Census 2016.  \n4  Tonga Department of Statistics 2016. \n5 The World Risk Index (World Risk Report 2018) ranks Tonga as the second highest country in the world in terms of \nrisks from natural hazards. \n \n ", "2 \nNuku\u2019alofa\u2019s flooding problems will likely worsen if no significant measures are taken.6 As the poor \ncommunities usually live in the flood prone areas, they suffer more from flooding. Waterlogging \nwith poor sanitation also increases incidence of typhoid, diarrhea, and skin diseases. The \nstagnant water will introduce more mosquito, leading to more vectorborne diseases. There are \nalso gender impacts of flooding as women have caring responsibilities (as a result of health risks), \nand are primarily responsible for household maintenance. \n \n6.  Due to climate change, the greatest long-term threat to Nuku\u2019alofa is sea-level rise, which \nwill lead to permanent sea water inundation in low-lying areas. The initial impacts are already \nobserved. In the low-lying districts of Popua and Sopu,7 rising sea levels have led to inundation \nduring spring tides and storm surges. By 2100, mean sea level is projected to be approximately \n1 meter higher than present under an RCP8.5 scenario,8 so most of Nuku\u2019alofa area will lie below \nsea level. However, the flat terrain of Nuku\u2019alofa limits engineering options to mitigate flooding, \nand in areas where trunk channels might be effective, mitigating flooding beyond once-in-2-year \nfrequency would require significantly wider channels. The unavailability of land to accommodate \nwider channel systems raise additional challenges. \n \n7.  Because of these challenges, a citywide flood management system is not viable at \npresent. However, some infrastructure and nature-based solutions should be implemented in the \nshort to medium term to minimize the flooding in the city. These solutions would focus on \neconomically important roads and areas particularly the central business district and lower-lying \nareas based on criteria of (i) the bigger number of properties and benefited catchment areas, (ii) \nthe higher flood level reduction associated with the proposed works, and (iii) the less land \nrequirement of privately leased or owned land. \n \n8.  Sanitation. Most households are served by septic tanks which used to be desludged only \nwhen full or overflowing. Septic tanks could be the main source of contaminants in aquifers in the \nNuku\u2019alofa area.9 The availability of septic tank desludge trucks, together with increased public \nawareness of environment, has created a significant increase in septage cleaning and collection. \nHowever, septage sludge treatment facility in Tapuhia has the capacity of 10,000 liters per day, \nwhich would treat only up to 74% of the households and commercial septage generated in \nNuku\u2019alofa, it should be augmented to allow regular desludging of all septic tanks and to treat the \nlandfill leachate.  \n \n9.  Solid waste management. The state-owned enterprise of the Waste Authority Limited \n(WAL) does the waste management in Tongatapu. The government has expanded its operation \nto cover all of the outer islands in the next few years. This expansion will place an extra demand \non the only safe disposal facility of the Tapuhia Waste Management Facility (TWMF) until other \nsafe disposal facility is constructed. TWMF current landfill cell will be fulfilled in 2023 based on \nthe demand.10 Adequate solid waste collection and disposal helps to minimize the flood risk by \nreducing the waste blocking of the drains. Furthermore, in the urban and semi-urban communities \naround TWMF, public demand of a clean environment requires TWMF to upgrade its operation. \nTherefore,  TWMF\u2019s operation and capacity should be upgraded to meet the requirements. \n \n                                                \n6 Australian Bureau of Meteorology and Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. 2014. \nClimate Variability, Extremes and Change in the Western Tropical Pacific: New Science and Updated Country \nReports. Melbourne. \n7  As per the Tonga National Population and Housing Census 2016, 19,000 people live in these areas. \n8 Egis Eau. 2018. Climate Risk and Vulnerability Assessment for the preparation of the Tonga Integrated Urban \nResilience Sector Project. \n9  Tonga Water Board (TWB) report. \n10 Tapuhia Waste Management Facility (TWMF) funded by Australian Agency for International Development, was \ncommissioned in 2007. NUDSP supported the construction of the second landfill cell, which was commissioned in \n2014. \n \n ", "3 \n10.  Water supply. Supported by NUDSP, since 2015, potable water supply coverage in \nNuku\u2019alofa area has reached 100%. However, due to the part of old water system, nonrevenue \nwater (NRW) is estimated to be 45%. 41% of households have reported issues of water pressure \nand 19% experienced with water service interruptions. 11 NUDSP implements zoning of the water \nsupply system, which allows water district to be isolated, and identify problem areas for repairing. \nUpon commissioning of the new zoning network, a monitoring program should be put in place as \nwell as a network upgrade plan to identify priority areas for rehabilitation. Because the RCP8.5 \nscenario estimates that the average duration and frequency of droughts in Tongatapu would \nincrease substantially impacting the availability of the water resource in Nuku\u2019alofa, the NRW \nmanagement will save precious water resource as well as energy consumption,  \n \n11.  Asset management. Management of existing and new urban infrastructure is a high \npriority. Government  policy  is  that the  cost  of  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of  utility \ninfrastructure should be funded from user charges. The government intends to work closely with \npublic enterprises, the private sector, and development partners to lift the overall performance of \nthe public utility sector and to achieve self-funding of sustainable O&M. However, not all public \nutility enterprises have developed and implemented asset management frameworks and plans.  \nAmong them, Tonga Water Board (TWB) and WAL need strong support to continue the asset \nmanagement plan developed by NUDSP to ensure the service sustainability.  \n \n12.  Value added by ADB assistance and lessons learnt. The Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) has been one of the major development institutions supporting the development of urban \ninfrastructure and improvement of urban services in Nuku\u2019alofa, and has relevant experience and \nknowledge of the sector.12 This project is the third in a series of ADB investments and capacity \nbuilding activities in Nuku\u2019alofa\u2019s urban sector which commenced in 2008,13 and it expands critical \ninvestments of NUDSP but not limited by sanitation, waste management and water supply. Lessons \nlearned from previous investments have be incorporated in the project design, which enhances  the \nlong term asset management plans to ensure the service sustainability and provides technical \nsolutions to address long standing issues such as NRW and flooding. Due to the limit of the funding, \nthe previous projects address the most urgent and specific urban requirements as water supply and \nwaste management. This project has considered not only short-term urban development priorities \nbut also initiation of activities to adapt to the significant long-term climate change impacts on \nNuku\u2019alofa in a holistic method. For the first time, the project will manage the nexus of solid waste, \nflood, and waste water to ensure the comprehensive benefit in urban area. It also allows the start \nof a longer-term policy dialogue with the government on user\u2019 charges and O&M plan. The project \nis  in  line  with  ADB  Strategy  2030,  highlighting  the  differentiated  approach  to  small  island \ndeveloping states, specifically focusing the operational priorities 3, 4 and 6: tackling climate \nchange, building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability; \nmaking cities more livable; and strengthening governance and institutional capacity.14  \n \n13.  Modality of sector loan financing. The sector loan financing is used as (i) it follows the \ngovernment\u2019s document of urban sector development plan for Tonga (footnote 1), (ii) the co-\nfinancing partner of NUDSP has confirmed their additional co-financing and ADB will not provide \nadditional financing, 15 and (iii) additional subprojects may be identified during the implementation. \n                                                \n11 TWG. 2018 TWB Investment Proposal.

They prepared additional co-financing for the project in \nJuly 2019.  \n \n ", "4 \nThe National Spatial Planning and Management Act, prepared under the NUDSP and approved \nby the government, will provide the framework for planning and coordinating urban  sector \ndevelopment. The selection criteria of the subprojects are outlined in the project administration \nmanual (PAM)16 and safeguards frameworks have been developed during project preparation to \ncater to this modality. \n \nB.  Impacts and Outcome \n \n14.  The  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impacts:  (i)  living  standards  in  Nuku\u2019alofa \nimproved, and (ii) resilience to existing extreme natural events and to the threat of climate change \nincreased.17 The project will have the following outcome: Nuku\u2019alofa residents have access to \nimproved, effective, and climate-resilient urban services and infrastructure.18 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n15.  Output 1: Effective flood risk management infrastructure implemented. To reduce \nflood  risk,  the  project  will  rehabilitate  and  provide  new  flood  management  and  drainage \ninfrastructure  at  seven  flood-prone  locations  throughout  Nuku\u2019alofa,  comprising  the  central \nbusiness district, Vuna road, Salote road, Fanga, Haveluloto, Tofoa, and Sopu.19 The project will \nalso assist the Ministry of Infrastructure to review the current Land Transport Division funding \narrangements and to prepare and implement a review of tariff structures and charges to achieve \nand maintain full recovery of O&M costs for public flood management and drainage infrastructure. \nThe project will also assist the Land Transport Division to prepare a 10-year asset management \nplan; provide capacity-building support to operate, repair, and maintain the new drainage network; \nand strengthen revenue collection and asset management. \n \n16.  Output 2: Water supply service in Nuku\u2019alofa improved. The project will reduce \nnonrevenue water through the rehabilitation and upgrade of Nuku\u2019alofa\u2019s piped water distribution \nnetwork and by improving TWB leak detection, monitoring, repair, and maintenance capabilities. \nThe  project  will  also  improve  the  TWB\u2019s  service  capacities  by  providing  new  field  testing \nequipment and vehicles and building capacity to use water supply models and field data to guide \nthe planning and implementation of pipe distribution network upgrades. The project will also carry \nout a gender-sensitive review of the current TWB tariff structures and charges to achieve and \nmaintain full recovery of O&M costs while maintaining community service obligations. The project \nwill also assist the TWB to prepare a 10-year asset management plan and to develop policies and \nprocesses to support women in the workplace. \n \n17.  Output  3:  Public  and  environmental  health  enhanced.  The  project  will  enhance \nseptage and solid-waste management and collection in Tongatapu by upgrading the Tapuhia \nseptage and leachate wastewater treatment plant; constructing a new sanitary landfill cell; \nproviding a new office and a mechanical servicing facility at Tapuhia sanitary landfill; and \nprocuring essential plant and equipment to expand waste operations, including waste collection \ntrucks that will allow women to work as waste collectors for the first time. The project will assist \nWAL  to  improve  its  financial  management  capacity  and  will  review  the  current WAL  tariff \nstructures and charges to achieve and maintain full recovery of O&M costs while ensuring that \nwaste  services  are  affordable  and  accessible  to  the  poorest  members  of  the  community. \nConsidering WAL is mandated to expand its operations to the outer islands, the project will assist \nWAL to explore possible economically and environmentally sustainable solutions for waste \nmanagement in the outer islands, including the shipping of waste to Tapuhia. The project will also \n                                                \n16 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 Government of Tonga. 2015.Tonga Strategic Development Framework 2015\u20132025.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n22.  The project is found to be economically viable, with an overall economic internal rate of \nreturn of 9.3% and economic net present value of $0.2 million; the water supply and sanitation \nsubprojects  are  also  estimated to  yield  returns  higher  than  the  9.0% threshold. The flood \nmanagement subproject is not viable on its own but is integral to ensuring urban resilience in \nTonga as it is seen to reduce flooding incidence and thus the costs of post-flood repairs for both \nhouseholds and businesses. The water supply subproject will cut losses from leakage and faulty \nmetering,  increasing  the  local  supply  and  improving  cost  recovery.  Finally,  the  sanitation \nsubproject is expected to bring significant health benefits by reducing exposure to waterborne \ndiseases. The water supply and sanitation subprojects remain economically viable under all \nadverse scenarios. All subprojects appear most sensitive to increases in investment costs or \nreductions in benefits, but these are not seen to be major concerns. \n \n23.  Individual financial evaluations of the revenue-generating subprojects find only the water \nsupply subproject to be viable on its own, with a financial internal rate of return of 3.9% (versus a \n3.0%  discount  rate)  and  financial  net  present  value  of  $177,856.  However,  the  sanitation \nsubproject is expected to be financially sustainable as WAL is seen to expand its services to more \ncustomers, and earn enough revenues to fund the operation and maintenance of project assets. \nA tariff review planned under this project should help implementing agencies  achieve cost \nrecovery and explore options for optimal user charges; public consultations and the planned work \nin the water, sanitation, and hygiene awareness should improve public understanding of the need \nfor sustainable water and sanitation services. The non-revenue-generating flood management \nsubproject is likewise seen to be financially sustainable because historical increases in the budget \nallocations to the Ministry of Infrastructure-Land Transport Division suggest that enough additional \nfunds will be made available to support operation and maintenance expenses for project assets, \nwhich are forecast to be only a small part of the total budget. In both cases, the grant agreement \nassures financial sustainability of project assets as detailed in para. 20 above. The Pacific \nDisaster Resilience Program 20 would also provide financial support, especially in times of disaster \nor emergency. \n \nB.  Governance \n \n24.  A financial management assessment for the project was conducted in August 2018.21 The \nassessment considered the MOF as the executing agency and the MLNR as the implementing \nagency, including funds-flow arrangements, staffing, accounting and financial reporting systems, \nfinancial information systems, and internal and external auditing arrangements. The financial \nmanagement capacity of the MOF, based on the public expenditure and financial accountability \nassessment and from being the executing agency for other ADB-funded projects, is considered \nadequate.  The  MLNR  has  the  capacity  and  experience,  demonstrated  through  being  the \nimplementing agency for the ongoing NUDSP, and it is proposed that the advance account and \nstatement  of  expenditures  procedure  be  used.  The  overall  inherent  and  project  financial \nmanagement risk assessment is considered moderate, given that a new project management unit \n(PMU) will be set up and the new staff will be trained on ADB\u2019s disbursement, financial reporting, \nand auditing requirements. A key mitigating measure will be to ensure that a dedicated full-time \nproject accountant supports the PMU in the MLNR. The MOF and MLNR have agreed to \nimplement an action plan as key measures to address the deficiencies. Financial management \nrisks and risk mitigation measures will be reviewed and updated throughout the life of the project. \n                                                \n20 ADB. 2017.

Manila. \n21 In accordance with ADB. 2009. Guidelines for the Financial Management and Analysis of Projects and the Financial \nDue Diligence: A Methodology Note. Manila. \n ", "8 \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the \ngovernment and particularly with the MOF. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 16). \n \nC.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n25.  The poverty and social analysis notes that there is an increasing trend towards migration \nfrom rural to urban areas for better access to social services and income opportunities. In the last \ndecade this has resulted in rapid urban population growth in Nuku\u2019alofa, which has put pressure \non urban infrastructure perpetuating hardship in relation to a lack of access to quality essential \nservices. In this context, specific groups most vulnerable to hardship live in areas with recurrent \nfloods or perpetual standing water, and are also vulnerable to natural hazards, poor sanitation \nconditions,  and  deficient  water  supply.  The  project  aims  to  improve  living  standards, \nenvironmental management, and urban development by fostering equitable, reliable, and quality \nwater and waste management services, as well as improve resilience to climate change risk. \n \n26.  This project is classified as effective gender mainstreaming. In the project sites, women \nare concerned about (i) affordability of services such as water, (ii) improvement of health and well-\nbeing  of  households,  (iii)  opportunities  for  income  generation,  and  (iv)  ensuring  women\u2019s \ninvolvement in consultation and decision-making. The overall project will provide indirect benefits \nto women, including improving health and well-being of households, and reducing pressure on \nwomen\u2019s time (because of lack of reliable and quality water supply and the need to manage \nimpacts of flooding and poor sanitation, e.g., household maintenance, health issues, and caring \nresponsibilities). In addition, a gender action plan has been prepared with proactive gender design \nfeatures, including (i) a gender-sensitive tariff review; (ii) income-generating activities, including \nlong-term employment opportunities for women in nontraditional roles such as flood management \ninfrastructure workers, plumbers, meter readers, and waste collectors; (iii) increasing women\u2019s \nparticipation in decision-making at the community, institutional, and national levels through \nensuring participation of women and girls in the water, sanitation, and hygiene committees; (iv) \nsupporting the TWB to develop a gender strategy to support more women in the workplace, \nparticularly in technical and management roles; and (v) ensuring that gender analysis and \nrecommendations are included in the climate- and disaster-resilient urban development strategy \nand the community-based disaster risk management program.22 A social development and \ngender specialist will be engaged in the PMU to assist the MLNR in implementing and monitoring \nthe gender action plan and supporting activities under the plan. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n \n27.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows. \n \n28.  Environment (category B). The project is classified environment category B with an \nenvironmental  assessment  and  review  framework  (EARF)  and  three  initial  environment \nexaminations (IEEs) prepared.23 The EARF will guide environment assessment for candidate \nsubprojects whereas the draft IEEs have been completed for the three core subprojects. The IEEs \nconclude that no significant negative impacts are to be expected and that the subprojects will yield \nsubstantive net environmental benefits for flood management, environmental health, and water \nsupply. Any impacts during construction and operation will be avoided or mitigated through \nmeasures outlined in the environmental management plans, which will form part of all bidding \ndocuments.  During  implementation,  the  project  implementation  assistance  consultants  will \n                                                \n22 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23 Environmental Assessment and Review Framework; Initial Environmental Examination: Water Supply Subproject; \nInitial Environmental Examination: Public and Environment Health Subproject; and Initial Environmental Examination: \nFlood Management Subproject (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nsupport the MLNR in (i) preparing IEEs for subsequent subprojects, (ii) monitoring contractor \ncompliance and managing environmental impacts, and (iii) reporting on environmental monitoring. \nEnvironmental reporting to ADB will be on a semiannual basis. The government has endorsed \nthe EARF and the three IEEs. \n \n29.  Involuntary  resettlement  (category  B).  The  project  is  classified  category  B  for \ninvoluntary resettlement safeguards with the preparation of a resettlement framework and a draft \nresettlement plan. The resettlement framework has been prepared to guide any resettlement \nplans required during implementation for any unanticipated impacts. The resettlement plan is for \nacquisition  of  at  least  13  land  allotments  for  the  flood  management  subproject.  The  draft \nresettlement plan will be updated after detailed engineering design. For the water supply and \npublic  health  and  environmental  improvement  subprojects,  there  will  be  no  need  for  land \nacquisition as construction and repairs are expected to remain within existing pipes along the \nroad alignment and within the TWB reservoir and the TWMF. A due diligence report has been \nprepared to this effect. The project implementation assistance consultants will assist the MLNR \nto update, implement, and monitor the resettlement plan and manage any unanticipated impacts. \n \n30.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The project is classified category C for indigenous \npeoples planning with due diligence confirming that no indigenous communities will be impacted \nby any of the subprojects analyzed. The beneficiaries in the project sites are not discriminated \nagainst as a result of their language, skin color, or traditional practices. All project outputs will be \ndelivered in a culturally appropriate and participatory manner. \n \nE.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n31.  The project is categorized low risk because (i) the proposed financing amount does not \nexceed $200 million, (ii) ADB has a sound record of recent experience with urban sector projects \nin Tonga, (iii) there is reasonable implementing agency capacity in terms of externally financed \nproject administration, and (iv) safeguards are category B for environment and involuntary \nresettlement  and  C  for  indigenous  peoples.

ASSURANCES \n \n32.  The government and the MOF have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM (footnote 16) and grant documents. \n \n33.  The government and the MOF have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, \nwhich are set forth in the draft grant agreement. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n34.
