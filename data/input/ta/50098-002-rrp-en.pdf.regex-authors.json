THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Northern Mountain Provinces Transport Connectivity \nProject. \n \n2.  The proposed loan will finance the improvement of international and national transport \nconnectivity of underdeveloped provinces of Viet Nam by improving their access to Greater \nMekong Subregion (GMS) corridors. This project aims to expand the benefits of the GMS \ncorridors to the northwestern provinces, where high poverty incidence is reported, by enhancing \nthe road connectivity between the Noi Bai\u2013Lao Cai Expressway and the provinces of Lai Chau, \nLao Cai and Yen Bai. The project will improve National Highway 279 and National Highway 32, \nand upgrade Provincial Road 136 and Provincial Road 175 to national highways. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The economic and political reforms under the Doi Moi policy, launched in 1986, resulted \nin rapid economic growth (averaging over 6.5% annually during 1991\u20132017) and development in \nthe past 30 years. This growth has subsequently transformed Viet Nam from one of the world\u2019s \npoorest nations to a lower middle-income country, with a gross domestic product per capita of \n$2,389 in 2017. Viet Nam's poverty rate was 7.0% in 2015, the second lowest among the ASEAN \n(Association of Southeast Asian Nations) countries.1 Increased foreign direct investment and \ncloser integration with the global economy have accompanied the increasing market orientation \nof Viet Nam\u2019s economic policy, and the growth in private domestic enterprise.2 \n \n4.  The rapid economic growth of Viet Nam is largely because of the development of transport \ninfrastructure.  With  the  rigorous  efforts  of  the  government  and  the  assistance  of  major \ndevelopment partners such as the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the Japan International \nCooperation Agency, and the World Bank, a number of transport projects, mainly in the road \nsubsector, have been completed. Presently, Viet Nam\u2019s road network has a total length of \n268,787 kilometers (km) (0.81 km per square km). In the past 20 years, the government has \nprioritized the development of major highways and expressways, including part of the GMS \nKunming-Haiphong Transport Corridor.3 To date, expansion of the GMS expressway network is \nnearing completion, and the government is increasingly considering the use of the public\u2013private \npartnership modality or the build\u2013operate\u2013transfer modality for further expressway development. \nMoreover, the government\u2019s investment priorities have shifted to the other category roads, which \nwill further spread the benefits of the existing road network throughout the country, especially to \npeople living in less-developed regions. \n \n5.  Viet Nam\u2019s Northwest Region, a high mountainous region comprising the provinces of \nDien Bien, Hoa Binh, Lai Chau, Lao Cai, Son La and Yen Bai, lags behind the rest of the country, \nwith the highest poverty rate ranging from 18% to 45% in 2016.4 Over 50% of the region\u2019s \npopulation is made up of ethnic minority groups, including Tay, H'Mong, Thai, Dao, and Muong. \nThe ethnic minorities, who make up only 15% of the country\u2019s population, constituted 73% of the \n                                                \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB).

Washington, DC. ", "2 \npoor in 2016. Industrial production in the Northwest Region is less developed than in other \nregions, with many small-scale industrial companies. The major industries include stone, metal \nore exploitation and processing, lime brick, and beer production. There are no large processing \nmanufacturing enterprises in the region. The ethnic minority people in the region live with nomadic \nhabits, and practice self-production and self-consumption. Their average per capita consumption \nremains less than 45% of the Kinh and Hoa (the two majority ethnic groups in Viet Nam). The \npoor,  which  comprised  primarily  of  ethnic  minorities,  are  also  disadvantaged  by  their  low \neducation attainment and financial capacity; less than 60% of adults in poor households have \nprimary education or less, and less than 7% have post-secondary education (footnote 4). Key \nfactors causing the high poverty and slow development of the region include the following: (i) \npoorly developed infrastructure, particularly the infrastructure linking to markets and services; (ii) \nland  that  is  comparatively  not  well  suited  to  commercial  agriculture;  (iii)  remoteness  from \ncommercial and industrial hubs; and (iv) undeveloped local economies with limited nonfarm \nlivelihood opportunities. \n \n6.  With a relatively large area of land, high mountains, large rivers, fertile soil, beautiful \nlandscapes, and a border with the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and the People\u2019s Republic \nof China (PRC), the Northwest Region has great potential for development of agriculture, forestry, \nhydropower,  mining,  tourism,  and  border  trade.  However,  the  underdeveloped  transport \ninfrastructure has hindered the region\u2019s economic development, as it limits access of the local \npopulation to public services and economic opportunities. It also discourages private investment \nin the region. Currently, the region\u2019s overall road density is 0.71 km per square km, 13% less than \nthe country\u2019s average, while the national highway density is 0.051 km per square km, 20% less \nthan country\u2019s average of 0.064 km per square km. Therefore, improved connectivity within the \nregion  and  improved  access  to  the  economic  centers  of  the  country  are  critical  for  the \ndevelopment of the region. \n \n7.  The Noi Bai\u2013Lao Cai Expressway, considered the backbone of the Northwest Region\u2019s \nroad network, is part of the GMS Kunming\u2013Hai Phong Transport Corridor that connects the Ha \nNoi region to Yunnan Province in the PRC and passes through the provinces of Lao Cai and Yen \nBai. This expressway was completed in 2014, but the provinces in the corridors\u2019 proximity have \nnot fully benefited from it, showing a slower pace of development than the rest of the country. \nThis is because the national highway and provincial road networks are largely incomplete, and \nthe condition of the existing roads is generally poor. The existing roads are also prone to natural \ndisasters namely flash floods, landslides, rockfalls and wild fire, of which likelihood and magnitude \nof impacts are increasing due to global warming. The average annual temperature in Viet Nam \nhas increased by 0.4oC since 1960 and is projected to increase by 0.8-2.7oC by 2060.5 The \nclimate change assessment projects that the magnitude of May precipitation will increase possibly \nup to 59-61%, and the magnitude of December precipitation will increase possibly up to 173%-\n208%.6 \n \n8.  The project will improve and upgrade two road stretches totaling 198 km that connect \nseveral towns and districts in the provinces of Lai Chau, Lao Cai and Yen Bai to the Noi Bai\u2013Lao \nCai Expressway. These road stretches will connect to other main roads under the Lao Cai \nprovince transport development master plan to improve network connectivity with the Noi Bai-Lao \nCai Expressway.7 The existing roads pass through very difficult terrain with high mountains or \n                                                \n5  Irish Aid. 20017.

Ha Noi. \n ", "3 \nlarge rivers, so many substandard curves and grades have been adopted. Their conditions are \npoor; the average travel speed is 25 km per hour and several sections are not passable year-\nround. Therefore, a major rehabilitation or improvement is required to accommodate the expected \ntraffic growth due to the current economic development of the region. \n \n9.  The improved connectivity will (i) provide reliable access to basic social services such as \neducation, health care, job training, and emergency disaster relief, and (ii) increase economic and \nemployment opportunities for the people of the northwestern provinces, especially the poor ethnic \nminorities. The enhanced connectivity to the Noi Bai\u2013Lao Cai Expressway will provide further \nopportunities of cross-border trade with the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and the PRC. The \nimproved roads will help save travel time and costs, hence reducing fuel consumption and carbon \ndioxide emissions. The improvement and upgrade works will ensure consistency of standards \nover the entire road stretches, including climate resilience features namely slope protection \nmeasures in areas prone to landslides and rockfalls, raising and/or reconstructing highway \nembankments and bridges along road sections prone to dangerous flooding, and increasing \ncross-drainage capacity. The project will include awareness campaigns for road safety, HIV/AIDS, \nand human trafficking which will enable the vulnerable ethnic minorities to cope with possible \nnegative impacts of the project roads. The government\u2019s rigorous efforts to enforce laws and \nregulations on road safety have resulted in decrease of fatalities caused by road traffic accidents \nfrom more than 11,000 in 2011 to less than 9,000.8 However, creation of road safety awareness \nfor  the  people  in  the  project  area,  especially  the  poor  ethnic  minorities,  is  still  necessary \nconsidering the expected increased traffic speed and volume.  \n \n10.  The project supports the government\u2019s implementation of Viet Nam\u2019s national transport \nstrategy 2020 to provide efficient and safe transportation to international and domestic markets, \ntourism destinations, and social services facilities; all project roads are listed under the national \ntransport strategy. 9 The improvement of project roads fits ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for \nViet Nam, 2016\u20132020. The project is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 (Table 1).10 \n \nTable 1: Alignment with Strategy 2030 \nStrategy 2030 Priority  Project\u2019s Contributions \n1.  Addressing  (i) Increasing the emphasis on human development and social inclusion. The \nremaining poverty  improved roads will make access to economic opportunities and social \nand reducing  services including health care, education, and agricultural advice services \ninequalities  possible and more affordable to the poor. Migration of the workforce to major \ntowns and cities for higher-paying jobs will be easier.  \n(ii) Improving education and training. The improved roads will facilitate \nestablishment of education institutions and mobilization of professional advice \nservices and production knowhow in the project area. \n2.  Promoting rural  (i) Improving market connectivity and agricultural value chain linkages. The \ndevelopment and  improved roads will allow faster and more cheaply transportation of agriculture \nfood security  products to distant markets, including markets that are currently inaccessible. \n(ii) Increasing agricultural productivity and food security. The improved roads will \nallow easier access to agricultural inputs such as fertilizer, seeds, tools and \nmachinery, innovation, and production knowhow. The shortened transport time \nand improved rideability will reduce product losses during transportation, \nhence reducing the transportation cost.  \n                                                \n8  United Nations. 2018.

Climate adaptation measures, including reinforced \nslope  protection,  rockfall  protection  galleries,  and  increased  drainage  capacity,  will  be \nincorporated in the engineering design to improve climate resilience of the project roads. ADB will \nwork closely with the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), who will provide \na grant to finance the detailed engineering design (DED) of the project roads on behalf of the \nGovernment of Australia, as a collaborative cofinancier of ADB. The DFAT grant will also support \nthe awareness campaigns for road safety, HIV/AIDS, and human trafficking; and the development \nof an axle load control program to enhance inclusiveness and sustainability of the project. This \ncofinancing was made possible by ADB\u2019s catalytic role. \n \n12.  Lessons  learned.  ADB  has  supported  Viet  Nam  and  its  neighboring  countries  on \nimprovement of national and regional connections mainly through the enhancement of GMS \ncorridors,  national  highways,  and  rural  road  networks.  Previous  project  completion  reports \nhighlighted the need for ADB to monitor the implementation of adequate road maintenance \nthrough (i) funds allocation to the Viet Nam National Road Maintenance Fund (NRMF) and (ii) \nmeasures related to enforcement of axle load control. The NRMF is being supported by the World \nBank, and the axle load control program development will be incorporated in the activities under \nthe DFAT grant as a part of the detailed design. ADB will coordinate with these development \npartners to achieve the project impact and facilitate development of the road sector in Viet Nam. \nOther lessons include the need to account for lengthy decision-making processes, significant lead \ntime for approval procedures, and extensive administrative procedures. The project\u2019s time line \nwas prepared to accommodate these constraints. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n13.  The  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  economic,  sociocultural,  and \nenvironmental development in lagging and border areas accelerated (footnote 9). The project will \nhave the following outcome: road connectivity to GMS corridors in northwestern provinces of Viet \nNam improved.11 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n14.  Output 1: Safe and climate-resilient national highways in lagging provinces of \nnorthwestern Viet Nam completed. This output will be achieved through (i) improvement of two \nnational highway sections (National Highway 279 from Bao Ha to Khau Co, and National Highway \n32 from Khau Co to Ban Bo) and upgrading of Provincial Road 136 from Ban Bo to Dong Pao and \nfrom Dong Pao to San Thang to class IV national highway, a total of 147 km; and (ii) upgrading \n                                                \n11 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n ", "5 \nof the current Provincial Road 175 section from Mau A to Nghia Lo to a class III and IV national \nhighway, a total of 51 km.12 The road works will incorporate climate resilience and road safety \nmeasures by introducing sound slope protection measures in areas prone to landslides and \nrockfalls, raising highway embankments and bridges along road sections prone to flooding, \nincreasing cross-drainage capacity, and installing road safety devices and pavement markings. \n \n15.  Output 2: Awareness for road safety, HIV/AIDS, and human trafficking created. This \noutput will be achieved through the preparation and implementation of awareness campaigns for \nthe communes and villages along the project roads. \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n16.  The project is estimated to cost $240.59 million (Table 2). ADB financing will cover civil \nworks and consulting services for construction supervision and financial audit.

The project is classified as high climate risk. The project\u2019s climate risk and vulnerability \nassessment concluded that the major climate risk is the likelihood of increased flash floods, \nlandslides and rockfalls resulting from a projected increase in precipitation (footnote 6). Climate \nadaptation is estimated to cost $10.2 million. ADB will finance 100% of the climate adaptation \ncost. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  The  Ministry  of Transport (MOT)  will  be  the executing  agency. The  MOT\u2019s  Project \nManagement Unit 2 (PMU2), with the support of the construction supervision consultant, will serve \nas the implementing agency.

Technical \n \n20.  The project was prepared based on the feasibility study conducted under ADB\u2019s technical \nassistance for the Greater Mekong Subregion Corridor Connectivity Enhancement Project.14 Most \nof the rehabilitation and improvement works will follow existing road alignments. Three partial \nroad realignments (totaling 15 km) were proposed for bypassing highly populated village centers. \nThese realignments were deemed necessary to avoid or minimize involuntary resettlement, \nimprove traffic safety, and reduce noise and emissions in these areas. Some improvement works \n(horizontal and vertical curve adjustment, road widening, repaving, slope stabilization, raising of \nembankments, increasing of drainage capacities, and bridge reconstruction) will be included as \npart of climate adaptation measures. The DED will be prepared under a parallel collaborative \nfinancing grant from the Government of Australia though the Aus4Transport program. The DED \nconsultant will update environment and social safeguards documents as necessary and support \nthe  programs  for  axle  load  control  and  awareness  for  road  safety,  HIV/AIDS  and  human \ntrafficking. The grant will be administered by DFAT. The DED consultant will be mobilized by May \n2019 and a complete DED package will be available by June 2020. Further details of the programs \nwill be prepared during DED in consultation among the PMU2, DFAT, and ADB. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n21.  Economic  analysis.  The  economic  evaluation  of  the  project  was  conducted  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines by comparing life cycle costs in with- and without- project \ncases,15 using a 9% discount rate and the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) as decision \ncriteria and using the Highway Development and Management Model (HDM-4). The benefits \nconsidered in the economic appraisal are savings in vehicle operation costs, improvements in \ntravel time, and reduction in accidents. The estimated EIRR for the project is 14.24%, with a net \npresent value of $98.6 million at the discount rate of 9%. Sensitivity analysis was carried out to \ninvestigate the economic viability of the project with the following adverse changes in costs and \nbenefits: (i) capital costs increased by 15%, (ii) vehicle operating cost benefit reduced by 15%, \n(iii) value of time benefit reduced by 15%, (iv) benefit of reduced casualties excluded, and (v) \ncapital costs increased by 15% and benefits reduced by 15%. In all scenarios, the EIRR of the \nproject remains above 9%, demonstrating the project\u2019s robustness. The economic viability of the \nproject is most sensitive to a 15% increase in capital costs and a 15% reduction in benefits, which \ndecreases the EIRR to 11.24%. In addition to quantified benefits, the project will have intangible \nbenefits, as it will contribute to the economic growth of the relatively poor populations in the vicinity \nof the project through the provision of improved access to income opportunities, as well as social, \nhealth, and education facilities. Carbon dioxide reduction benefits are calculated as $0.07 million \nper annum as a climate mitigation impact of the project. \n \n22.  Financial  sustainability.  The  project  will  not  generate  revenue.  The  government \nestablished the NRMF and local road maintenance funds in 2012 for better management of road \nmaintenance in the country. The NRMF\u2019s revenue comes from road user fees and supplementary \nnational  budget  while  the  local  road  maintenance  funds  come  from  road  user  fees  and \nsupplementary  provincial  budget.  With  the  NRMF,  the  national  road  maintenance  budget \n                                                \n14 ADB. 2016.

Manila. \n \n ", "8 \nincreased from 2013 to 2016, and the per km maintenance cost for national roads under \nmaintenance increased by about 70% in the same period. This indicates that the budget allocation \nfor  regular  maintenance  of  priority  national  roads  is  adequate.16 The  MOT  confirmed  that \nprioritized allocation of operation and maintenance budget from the NRMF will be made to the \nproject roads. Provincial Road 175 in Yen Bai Province will be upgraded to a national highway, \nwhich will be maintained using the NRMF budget allocation. Further, with the sustained economic \ngrowth and increase in the number of vehicles, the government plans to gradually expand the \nrevenue base of the road user charges, aiming at full coverage of the road maintenance and \nmajor rehabilitation needs in the long term. The effective utilization of the NRMF for this purpose \nis being supported by the World Bank. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n23.  Having  undertaken  several  ADB-financed  projects  in  the  past,  the  MOT  has  good \nexperience and understanding of ADB\u2019s procurement and financial management policies and \nprocedures.  Based  on the financial  management  assessment  carried out  under  the  PPTA \n(footnote 14), the MOT has adequate capacity for procurement and financial management. The \ngrievance redress mechanism and project website will be developed and included under the \ncurrent website of the PMU2.17 ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained to and discussed with the government and MOT. The financial management risk is \nmoderate since the oversight by the MOT finance section has proven effective and the PMU2 has \nits own accounting staff to meet MOT requirements. An external financial auditor will be engaged \nfor the audits of the project financial statements under the project to ensure full compliance with \nADB\u2019s  requirements.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the PAM (footnote 13). \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n24.  Poverty  reduction  and  social  benefits  include  indirect  economic  benefits  and  direct \nbenefits of improved rural livelihood productivity through the livelihood development program \nintegrated in the RPs as well as enhanced community welfare through improved awareness of \nroad safety, and HIV/AIDS and human trafficking.18 The project design enhances social utility of \nthe roads for poor ethnic minorities, including women and children. Meaningful consultation will \nbe conducted throughout final project design and implementation. The social development and \nmitigation  activities  will  be  carried  out  principally  in  partnership  with  community-based \norganizations. The RPs and EMDPs provide targeted interventions to improving living standards \nof vulnerable people.19 Details of the HIV/AIDS and human trafficking awareness program; the \nroad safety awareness program; and the consultation, participation, and communication plan will \nalso be provided for the people in the project area. The project is categorized as having some \ngender  elements.  Key  gender-related  activities  include  (i)  project  detailed  design  and \nimplementation  based  on  gender  and  social  responsiveness,  (ii)  unskilled  jobs  for  women \ngenerated from road construction, (iii) gender-responsive social protection for the labor force, (iv) \nwomen\u2019s involvement in and benefits from road safety awareness and enforcement, and (v) \nmitigation of HIV/AIDS and human trafficking risks because of improved connectivity. \n \n                                                \n16 World Bank.

Safeguards \n \n25.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.20 \n \n26.  Environment (category A). An environmental impact assessment (EIA) was prepared \nand disclosed on the ADB website in April 2018.21 Without mitigation measures, the project\u2019s \nenvironmental impacts have the potential to be significant. It is anticipated that the project will \naffect 3 hectares of protected forest, including 1 hectare of protected forest in the Hoang Lien Van \nBan Nature Reserve (HLVBNR). This impact will be fully offset in compliance with the Viet Nam \nForestry Law (2018) and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. The project design is consistent with \nthe HLVBNR master plan (2012).22 The project\u2019s impacts on the HLVBNR and its protection \nobjectives will not be significant. Suitable disposal sites outside HLVBNR will need to be identified \nfor the disposal of the estimated 6.3 million cubic meters of spoil. Training will be provided to \nconstruction workers on the HLVBNR\u2019s sensitivities. \n \n27.  Other  anticipated  construction-related  environmental  impacts  include  fugitive  dust, \nconstruction noise, temporary traffic disturbance, and occupational and community safety at \nconstruction sites. Adherence to the environmental management plan (EMP) will reduce residual \nimpact significance to an acceptable level. Incremental effects of operational traffic on ambient \nnoise and air quality are expected to be insignificant. The capacity of the PMU2 to oversee the \nEMP implementation will be strengthened through the training provided by the construction \nsupervision consultant and external monitoring consultant. Public consultation involving 1,100 \npotentially affected people and more than 50 representatives from relevant local authorities was \ncarried out during EIA preparation to inform the project design and environmental assessment \nprocess. A grievance redress mechanism has been defined. \n \n28.  Involuntary resettlement (category A). A total of 776,897 square meters of private and \npublic  lands  in  Lai  Chau,  Lao  Cai  and  Yen  Bai  provinces  will  be  acquired,  affecting  957 \nhouseholds (4,370 affected people). Of these, 115 households (454 individuals) will be severely \naffected,  6  households  (28  individuals)  will  experience  physical  displacement,  and  634 \nhouseholds (2,669 individuals) will experience economic displacement because of loss of income \nfrom affected land or business. Three RPs compliant with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and \nViet Nam\u2019s laws have been prepared to mitigate the impacts, in consultation with the affected \nhouseholds. The RPs were disclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 23 August 2018. Mitigation of \ninvoluntary  resettlement  impacts  includes  compensation  at  replacement  cost  for  affected \nproperty; assistance with resettlement within existing communities; a livelihood development \nprogram;  and  ongoing  meaningful  consultations,  including  detailed  needs  assessment  for \nlivelihood development. Details of the grievance redress mechanism are included in the RPs. \nCapacity building for PMU2 and local authorities will be provided by the supervision consultants. \n \n29.  Indigenous  peoples  (category  B).  Ethnic  minority  peoples  are  the  overwhelming \nmajority in the project areas (70% to 86% of the total population).23 Both positive and negative \nimpacts have been identified. The ethnic minorities will be mainly affected by involuntary land \nacquisition and resettlement. Other identified risks include HIV transmission, human trafficking, \nand risks associated with road safety. Positive impacts include economic benefits from improved \n                                                \n20 ADB.
