THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Support to Border Areas Development Project.1 \n \n2.  The project supports the Cambodia\u2013Laos\u2013Viet Nam Development Triangle Area (CLV-\nDTA) objectives of (i) facilitating the flow of goods, people, and investment capital; and (ii) \naccelerating economic growth within the five Viet Nam Development Triangle Area (VDTA) \nprovinces  of  Binh  Phuoc,  Dak  Lak,  Dak  Nong,  Gia  Lai,  and  Kon  Tum.2 The  VDTA  is \ncharacterized by a high concentration of ethnic minorities, low gross domestic product, and \nareas of persistent poverty. The key impediments to more inclusive growth are insufficient \ntransport and other basic infrastructure, as well as limited institutional capacity. To improve the \nefficiency of public investment and maximize the benefits of economies of scale and synergies \nwith ongoing or planned projects, the Government of Viet Nam is advocating an integrated area \napproach  under  which  neighboring  localities  will  work toward  common  development goals, \neconomies of scale, and jointly enhanced competitiveness. This approach characterizes the \ndesign philosophy of the project, which will address the key impediments to inclusive growth. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The  VDTA  is  the  largest  agricultural  producer  in  the  CLV-DTA,  and  its  five  main \nindustrial crops are coffee, rubber, pepper, cassava, and cashew kernels, which are traded on \ninternational commodity markets. Despite overall poverty reduction and the steady increase in \nagricultural production and exports since the 1990s, VDTA provinces still face development \nchallenges, such as slow growth, persistent income and non-income inequality of vulnerable \nand disadvantaged groups, and low competitiveness. Of the VDTA\u2019s population of 5,114,780 \npeople, 33% are ethnic minorities and about 77% relies on agriculture as their main source of \nlivelihood. In 2014, the gross domestic product per capita in the VDTA was $1,683, about 80% \nof the national average. The average poverty rate for VDTA\u2019s ethnic minorities was about 19% \nagainst the national average of about 6% for all ethnic groups, indicating that ethnic minorities \nare  not  fully  benefiting  from  development  advances  including  social  services  as  well  as \neconomic assets and opportunities.3 Transport connectivity within both CLV-DTA and VDTA \nremains inadequate partly due to the difficulty in mobilizing funds for infrastructure investment. \nSome progress has been made in signing and implementing CLV-DTA cross border trade and \nbusiness agreements but still limited to certain border gates, and mostly on the Vietnamese \nside.  The  institutional  capacity  of  VDTA  provinces  in  formulating  and  implementing  their \ndevelopment strategies including investment planning and participation in regional cooperation \nis weak. For example, all VDTA provinces but Dak Lak were ranked among the 20 lowest of all \n63  provinces  on  the  provincial  competitiveness  index  which  assesses  the  ease  of  doing \nbusiness, economic governance, and administrative reforms by the provincial governments.4  \n \n4.   These  challenges  and  constraints  are  primarily  due  to  (i)  inadequate  physical \ninfrastructure  and  poor road conditions, (ii)  untapped  business  and  livelihood  development \nopportunities,  and  (iii)  weak  institutional  capacity  for  investment  planning  and  resource \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance for the Support to Border \nAreas Development Project (TA 8849-VIE). \n3  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n4  The Viet Nam Chamber of Commerce. 2015. The Viet Nam Provincial Competitiveness Index 2015. Ha Noi. ", "2 \n \nmanagement. The project will help the VDTA overcome these constraints and contribute to \nCLV-DTA  objectives  by  (i)  improving  the  transport  connectivity  and  safety;  (ii)  supporting \ntransport and trade facilitation (TTF); (iii) promoting inclusive, community-based tourism; and \n(iv) strengthening provincial capacity for more strategic investment planning and efficient project \nmanagement.  This  integrated  area  approach  will  diversify  economic  and  employment \nopportunities for rural communes by connecting them to increasing trade and passenger flows. \n \n5.  Related  policies  and  strategies.  The  project  is  aligned  with  Viet  Nam\u2019s  Socio-\nEconomic Development Plan, 2016\u20132020,5 which aims to expand the domestic market, promote \nexport, and sustain trading surpluses. More specifically, the development plan proposes to (i) \nstrengthen  domestic  markets  and  promote  exports  by  more  closely  linking  production, \nprocessing, and distribution; (ii) improve the quality and competitiveness of local products, \nespecially those that can be identified as a Viet Nam \u201ctrademark\u201d; and (iii) more fully utilize \nexisting and potential incentives through trade agreements. \n \n6.  The project is consistent with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Strategy 2020 and its \nmidterm review,6 which aim to (i) improve physical connectivity, (ii) expand the quality and \ncoverage of basic infrastructure to help create jobs for poor persons and ethnic minorities living \nin underdeveloped areas, and (iii) build capacity for decentralized public sector management. \nThese aims converge with the three pillars of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2016\u20132020 \nfor Viet Nam: (i) the promotion of job creation and competitiveness, (ii) enhanced and more \ninclusive infrastructure and service delivery, and (iii) improved environmental sustainability and \nclimate change response.7 The project is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, \n2017\u20132019 for Viet Nam.8 \n \n7.  The  project  will  galvanize  ADB\u2019s  long-term  commitment  to  the  Greater  Mekong \nSubregion  (GMS)  economic  cooperation  program  by  promoting  closer  integration  and \ncooperation among cross-border areas within Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, \nand Viet Nam.9 It is consistent with the GMS Transport and Trade Facilitation Action Plan, the \nupdated CLV-DTA master plan,10 and the government\u2019s transport development strategy.11 The \nproject also fits well with the GMS Tourism Sector Strategy12 and the government\u2019s Strategy for \nTourism Development in Viet Nam until 2020, Vision to 203013. Overall, it will contribute to \nexpanding market opportunities as envisaged by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \nEconomic Community. \n \n8.  Lessons. The project has considered lessons from ADB\u2019s recent transport projects, \nincluding (i) the importance of national and subregional transport efficiency, which will help \n                                                \n5  Government of Viet Nam, Ministry of Planning and Investment. 2016.

The  project  has  integrated \nlessons from ADB\u2019s successful GMS tourism sector assistance program and completed projects \nin Viet Nam, including the need to (i) analyze tourism demand in project areas to guide the \nselection of investments; (ii) improve cross-sector coordination and build synergies with other \nADB assistance; and (iii) carry out capacity-building programs to provide livelihood opportunities \nfor poor rural and ethnic minority households, especially those led by women.15 \n \n9.  ADB has been the most active development partner in supporting provinces within and \nadjacent to the VDTA as part of its operational prioritization of the country\u2019s central highlands \ninvolving  wide  sector  coverage.  ADB  will  follow  the  government\u2019s  focus  on  an  area-wide \napproach, with the project as the first intervention to help the VDTA become a regional cluster \nwith  shared  development  objectives. Greater  synergies  will  be  achieved  with  ongoing  and \nplanned support by ADB, such as the Productive Rural Infrastructure Sector Project in the \nCentral Highlands (approved in 2013)16 and the Water Efficiency Improvement for Drought-\nAffected Provinces (proposed for 2018), as well as support from other development partners. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The impact will be an established engine and gateway within the five VDTA provinces to \nwider regional and international markets. The outcome will be increased movement of goods, \nvehicles, and people among the five VDTA provinces. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n11.  Output 1: Road infrastructure in the five Viet Nam Development Triangle Area \nprovinces rehabilitated. The poor condition of critical roads constrains economic activities, \nincluding employment and income opportunities in all VDTA provinces. The project will improve \nphysical connectivity within and among the five provinces by upgrading national and provincial \nroads, as well as strategic roads that link the VDTA road network to border crossings with \nCambodia  and  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic.  The  roads  were  selected  using  a \nmulticriteria prioritization filter to ensure the greatest impact.17 Traffic is expected to increase as \nroad  conditions  improve,  and  appropriate  civil  works  designs  and  road  safety  awareness \nprograms will be provided to mitigate the higher risk of accidents. The project will provide \ntargeted traffic and road safety training to the most vulnerable road users. \n \n                                                \n14 For example, the GMS Noi Bai\u2013Lao Cai Highway\u2014the country\u2019s longest expressway, which opened in 2014\u2014has \nhalved travel times; reduced traffic accidents by 60%; and boosted the cross-border movement of vehicles, goods, \nand travelers to the People\u2019s Republic of China. \n15 Independent Evaluation Department. 2009.

Output 2: Viet Nam Development Triangle Area plans and facilities for transport \nand trade facilitation with a focus on inclusive growth developed. This output will stimulate \ninclusive economic activity by preparing an action plan to implement the CLV-DTA master plan \nand TTF agreements, taking into account ongoing and proposed TTF considerations under \nother regional frameworks, such as the GMS. The action plan will help project executing and \nimplementing agencies incorporate gender, ethnic minority, climate change, and environmental \naspects  into  integrated  area  development  planning  and  execution.  This  soft  infrastructure \nsupport supplements the rehabilitated physical connectivity by easing the movement of goods \nand people across borders, which will strengthen backward and forward links among agro-\nprocessing and other industries. \n \n13.  The benefits of improved transport connectivity will be harnessed further by promoting \npro-poor, ethnic-inclusive tourism to boost trade in goods and services. Provincial tourism plans \nprioritize inclusive, community-based, pro-poor tourism, and seven tourism subprojects have \nbeen selected for investment in Binh Phuoc, Dak Lak, Dak Nong, and Kon Tum.18 These \nprojects will include (i) small infrastructure improvements, such as water supply, solid waste, \nand wastewater management facilities; (ii) rural access road improvements, pathways, trails, \nand drainage; and (iii) the provision of related training to strengthen the business-enabling \nenvironment  and  provide  new  livelihood  opportunities  for  poor  rural  and  ethnic  minority \nhouseholds. \n \n14.  The  project  will  be  implemented  in  coordination  with  an  ongoing  regional  technical \nassistance project19 to help the VDTA integrate aspects related to the protection and use of \nnatural resources 20 into the strategic planning and development of the VDTA master plan. \n \n15.  Output  3:  Institutional  capacity  for  investment  planning,  project  design  and \nimplementation, and resource management strengthened. This output will help improve the \nefficiency of broad investment planning, project management, and small business development \nwithin the VDTA provinces in line with the VDTA\u2019s long-term development objective to become a \nstronger and more cohesive economic area. Activities include (i) institutional strengthening and \ntraining for officials appointed by the VDTA provinces to implement the action plans, and (ii) \ncapacity  development  and  business  support  programs  for  local  entrepreneurs,  especially \nwomen and ethnic minorities, to develop and operate small and micro-enterprises such as \naccommodation, agro- and food processing, food and beverage services, tourism transport \nservices, handicraft production, and other cultural industries. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n16.  The project is estimated to cost $122.11 million. Detailed cost estimates by expenditure \ncategory and financier are in the project administration manual (PAM).21 \n \n17.  The government has requested a loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR76.84 \nmillion from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (Asian Development Fund) to help finance the \n                                                \n18 A description of the selected tourism subprojects is in the Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n19 ADB. 2013.

The  PPMUs  will \ncooperate closely with commune personnel in (i) organizing public consultations, (ii) monitoring \ndesign and implementation, and (iii) creating a grievance redress mechanism with commune \nsupervision boards (CSBs).25 \n                                                \n24 The terms of reference for the implementation consultants are in the Project Administration Manual (accessible \nfrom the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 The CSBs will include at least one female representative. \n ", "7 \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n21.  Engineering solutions are based on whole life cost considerations that take into account \nthe project\u2019s technical feasibility, cost, durability, affordability, and environmental aspects, such \nas adequacy of embankment height, drainage and erosion control, for addressing extreme \nweather conditions. Standards and best practices that the contractors and local authorities are \nfamiliar with are used to eliminate delays. Contract packaging has been tailored to attract \nqualified contractors and capacity-building programs will help small entrepreneurs improve the \nbusiness-enabling environment. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n22.  Economic analysis was undertaken for each of the five road subprojects. The benefits \nquantified for output 1 come from reduced vehicle operating costs and time savings. The \neconomic internal rates of return (EIRRs) for the provincial subprojects are 18.7% (Gia Lai), \n16.4% (Dak Lak), 12.3% (Dak Nong), 12.2% (Kon Tum), and 13.1% (Binh Phuoc). The output 1 \ninvestment is assessed as feasible across all subprojects, with an EIRR of 14.5%. \n \n23.  The benefits quantified for output 2 are derived from the incremental increase in the \nnumber of visitors to the tourist sites (footnote 18), visitor spending, and additional revenues \narising from the homestay business. The estimated EIRR of the tourism subprojects averages \n15.4%, declining to 14.1% if the capacity strengthening costs under output 2 are included. \n \n24.  The project\u2019s economic viability was tested by combining the net cash flows of outputs 1 \nand 2, the costs of output 3, and project management overhead. The overall project was found \nto be economically feasible, with an EIRR of 13.9%.26 \n \n25.  Financial viability. A projection of the financial position of the five provinces for 2017\u2013\n2026 has been prepared. Revenue and expenditures have been conservatively projected to \ngrow annually over this period at the local inflation rate of 5% or, if higher, to follow past growth \ntrends. The dong is expected to depreciate by 5% each year. The projections include the \nprovincial project investment, ADB loan proceeds utilized, counterpart contribution, debt service \nrepayment on the subloan, and adequate O&M for the sustainable operation of the project \ninfrastructure. The financial analysis showed that the provinces can afford the project, as they \ncan provide the counterpart contribution, provide adequate O&M for sustainable operation, and \nrepay the debt service on the subloan. The annual counterpart contribution and combined \nannual O&M plus debt service are individually less than 1% of total state budget expenditures. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n26.  The financial management assessment indicates that the project-specific risks, which \nare generally moderate, can be reduced to low with appropriate mitigation measures, involving \nthe appointment of experienced and qualified staff to the PPMU, technical support, and training \nin ADB procedures.27 Each PPMU will (i) maintain separate project accounts and records by \nfunding source for all expenditures incurred under the project, (ii) cause the detailed project \naccounts to be audited following international auditing standards and ADB\u2019s requirements by an \n                                                \n26 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \n \nindependent auditor acceptable to ADB, and (iii) involve the CSBs to ensure their participation in \nmonitoring subproject implementation \n \n27.  The financing allocations and components that must follow ADB procedures have been \narranged taking into account the PPCs\u2019 limited experience and capacity for managing externally \nfunded projects. All procurement of goods and civil works and recruitment of consultants to be \nfinanced by the ADB loan must follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from \ntime to time) and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). \nThe government\u2019s public procurement regulations (as acceptable to ADB) will be applied for \npackages procured using national competitive bidding and shopping procedures. \n \n28.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  PPCs.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social  \n \n29.  The project will directly benefit about 225,000 people, including 12,400 ethnic minority \nbeneficiaries of tourism subprojects (footnote 3). The poverty rate in the VDTA provinces, \nexcept  for  Binh  Phuoc,  is  higher  than  the  national  average.  Ethnic  minorities  represent  a \nrelatively larger share of the poor population, with many just above the poverty level and highly \nvulnerable to unpredicted events. Poverty is attributed to (i) a lack of land, labor, and credit, and \nlimited production knowledge and trade skills, especially on the part of poor ethnic women who \nhave limited education; and (ii) poor basic infrastructure, which hampers economic development \nby creating high costs throughout value chains such as agriculture and tourism. The project\u2019s \nroad  investments  will  expand  economic  opportunities  to  benefit  all,  while  the  tourism \ninvestments will benefit the rural poor, especially ethnic minorities. \n \n30.  Gender. The project is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. A gender analysis \nrevealed  that  women  have  fewer  opportunities  than  men  to  participate  in  public  decision-\nmaking, and less access to information, training, and employment, especially during the low \nagricultural season. A gender action plan was prepared that promotes (i) equality of project \nbenefits and opportunity-sharing between men and women; (ii) reduction in gender inequalities \nand social risks (HIV/AIDS transmission prevention, human trafficking prevention, and road \nsafety);  (iii)  training  of  women,  including  those  from  ethnic  minorities,  on  technical  topics, \nincluding tourism service deliveries; (iv) increased representation of women in decision-making \nbodies; and (v) collection of sex-disaggregated data for benefit monitoring and evaluation.28 \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n31.  Involuntary resettlement. Based on ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the \noverall project is classified category B for involuntary resettlement. The developments and \nimprovements under the subprojects are unlikely to trigger major resettlement impacts because \nmost of the infrastructure will be improved within existing rights-of-way (ROWs). As a result, the \nprimary points of concern will be minor land acquisition and compensation for roadside trees, \ncrops, or small structures that may be affected within the ROW. The PPCs and ADB have \nagreed on a combined resettlement and ethnic minorities development plan (REMDP).29 Minor \nland acquisition, compensation, allowances, operation and administration, surveys, monitoring, \n                                                \n28 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n29 Resettlement and Ethnic Minorities Development Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nand reporting will be financed by government counterpart funds. The internal monitor will ensure \nthat the resettlement process and impacts are evaluated properly and timely reported to ADB. \n \n32.  Indigenous peoples. Based on ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the overall \nproject is classified category B for indigenous peoples. Impacts on ethnic minorities in the \nproject areas are overwhelmingly positive since the subprojects will be aimed at the overall \neconomic and social improvement of the total population. The project will not cause physical \ndisplacement from traditional or customary lands, nor negatively impact the identity, culture, or \ncustomary  livelihood  system  of  ethnic  minorities.  The  REMDP  will  be  used  to  ensure  the \ninclusion of ethnic minorities and their access to project benefits. The REMDP also includes \nmitigation  measures  to  address  impacts  on  ethnic  minorities,  an  institutional  capacity \ndevelopment  program,  and  a  grievance  redress  mechanism.  It  also  complies  with  ADB \ninformation  disclosure  and  consultation  requirements.  The  seven  tourism  subprojects  are \nassessed category C for involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. \n \n33.  Environment. Based on ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the overall project is \nclassified category B. Initial environmental examinations (IEEs)30 were prepared for each of the \nfive road subprojects. The IEEs found only a few significant adverse impacts, none of which is \nirreversible. All road works under the project will be carried out within existing ROWs, and no \ncivil works will be carried out in sensitive biodiversity areas. The environmental management \nplans, included in the IEEs, will be updated during the detailed design of the road subprojects \nand reviewed and endorsed by ADB. The five tourism subprojects under output 2 involve the \nconstruction of small infrastructure in the villages to improve tourist destinations, and will cause \nminor or no environmental impacts. During project implementation, parallel to the preparation of \nthe detailed designs, rapid environmental assessments to be agreed with ADB will be carried \nout  to  reconfirm  the  tourism  subprojects  as  category  C.  A  climate  risk  and  vulnerability \nassessment was prepared based on climate projections downscaled within the VDTA.31 \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n34.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and management plan.32 With the mitigation measures, the overall risk is \nconsidered medium, and the project\u2019s benefits and impacts will outweigh the estimated costs. \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nRegional and local coordination  ADB will remain closely engaged with and actively support Viet Nam\u2019s \nDelays  in  implementing  CLV-DTA  participation  in  subregional  economic  cooperation  and  integration \ntransport  and  trade  agreements,  the  programs, including those related to transport and trade facilitation.

ASSURANCES \n \n35.  The government and VDTA PPCs have assured ADB that the implementation of the \noverall  project  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning \nanticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and \ndisbursement as described in detail in the PAM and loan documents.
