I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on the proposed \nloans to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Jamshoro Power Generation Project.1 \n \n2.  Acute power shortages of up to 20 hours per day have crippled economic growth and \ncaused social unrest in Pakistan.2 The country needs affordable, dependable base-load power \nto alleviate the shortage. Coal-fired power plants provide secure, inexpensive base-load power \nin many countries. The project introduces supercritical coal-fired power generation, which is the \nbest available technology for Pakistan. The environmental impact of this technology would be \nless than that of the existing heavy fuel oil (HFO)-fired power plants, and the more commonly \nused subcritical coal-fired power generation technology. The project, which is the first stage of a \nmulti-stage government plan for this site,3 has three components: (i) construction and 5 years of \noperational support for a 600-megawatt (MW) (net)/660-MW (nominal) supercritical coal-fired \nunit, with state-of-the-art emission control devices at the Jamshoro Thermal Power Station \n(TPS)  in  Sindh  province;  (ii)  capacity  development for  coal-fired  plant  operations;  and  (iii) \nenvironmental remediation of the existing power generation units and site. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.   Pakistan is exploring all options to reduce power load shedding and power cost but has \nfew medium-term options for affordable, dependable power supply. Natural gas was the main \nfuel used for Pakistan\u2019s base-load power plants,4 but the country\u2019s dwindling reserves of gas \nhave resulted in increasing use of high-cost imported fuel oil for power generation. This has \nincreased power generation costs and exacerbated the existing financial shortfall, both within \nthe sector and the national economy. Compared to existing, inefficient HFO-fired plants, the \nhigher efficiency supercritical generation units and diversification away from imported fuel oil will \nenable  Pakistan  to  increase  its  reliable  supply  of  electricity  and  lower  both  costs  and \ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.5 \n \n4.  Energy crisis. Pakistan\u2019s energy crisis depresses its economic performance and fuels \nsocial instability. Power shortages equaled about one-third of total demand (4,000\u20135,000 MW) \nduring most of fiscal year (FY) 2012.6 Increasing, unpredictable load shedding is estimated to \nconstrain annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth by at least two percentage points. \nSmall- and medium-sized enterprises that employ the largest number of people, but cannot \nafford back-up electricity generators and fuel, experience the largest impact. GDP growth has \naveraged 3% since 2007, while GDP growth of 7% is required to generate enough employment \nto absorb new labor market entrants. Poverty reduction and provision of basic necessities to the \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. The project is included in the country operations business \nplan (2013-2014) for Pakistan. \n2  ADB. 2013. Asian Development Outlook 2013. Manila. \n3  The government plans additional 600-MW supercritical coal-fired unit and conversion of existing units to coal.  \n4  Gas-fired power generation overtook hydropower in 1996 as the main power source. The share of gas in the \nthermal generation fuel mix has fallen from 56% (2006) to 44% (2011), while HFO increased from 42% to 54%.     \n5  The existing units at Jamshoro TPS use HFO and emit 930 grams of carbon dioxide (CO ) per kilowatt-hour (kWh). \n2\nThe project would emit 750 grams of CO  per kWh and a subcritical unit 850 grams of CO  per kWh. Backup \n2 2\ngenerators used to reduce power shortages are substantially less efficient and emit higher volume of CO .  \n2\n6  Ending June 2012. Government of Pakistan, National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA). 2012. State of \nIndustry Report 2012. Islamabad. \n ", "2 \npoor are immediate challenges for Pakistan. Low economic growth creates an environment for \nrecruitment by society\u2019s radical elements. The government introduced, as a priority, the new \nNational Power Policy to tackle these issues. PRs480 billion (about $4.5 billion) was paid to fuel \ncompanies and independent power producers to clear payment arrears. The government is \npursuing  gas  and  power  tariff  rationalization  and  energy  efficiency  measures  such  as \nconservation, transmission and distribution loss reduction, and rehabilitation of power plants.7 \n \n5.  High-power generation cost. Pakistan has 23,538 MW of installed power generation \ncapacity and 14,000 MW of available capacity on average. Even for the available capacity, \nHFO-fired power plants are not fully utilized because of a shortage of funds for fuel.  The \nincrease in HFO-fired power generation (high production cost) is the major reason the cost-\nrecovery tariff (average tariff) has continuously increased.8 The government has raised the base \ntariff by 106% from February 2008 to June 2013, despite this subsidy has increased to PRs5.79 \nper kilowatt-hour (kWh).9 This puts enormous pressure on the public finances and the country\u2019s \nbalance  of  payments.  For  fiscal  and  economic  sustainability,  the  government  must  lower \nelectricity generation costs and increase supply to reduce adverse impact from power shortages.  \n \n6.  Lowering the generation cost. The government aims to increase coal-based power \ngeneration while decreasing expensive HFO generation. This will require converting existing \nHFO generation units and constructing new plants.10 The imported HFO costs several times \nmore than domestic or imported coal, and has higher sulfur content.11 Electricity generated from \ncoal, through medium-term fuel supply contracts, will also help stabilize the power price. The \nNational Power Policy includes plans to diversify the energy mix.  \n \n7.  Renewable and gas-based generation. Improving energy security and affordability, the \ngovernment is pursuing large hydropower, gas, and other projects using domestic resources. \nPakistan has a low carbon footprint because of the large amount of hydropower and natural \ngas-based  power  generation.  However,  hydropower\u2019s  contribution  to  total  generation  has \ndeclined,12 and accounted for just 32% of power generated in 2012.13 Only 6,716 MW of a \npotential of over 40,000 MW of hydropower has been tapped, making large hydropower plants \nthe ideal solution. Although large hydropower is the least cost solution, the high capital cost, the \nlong implementation period, and complex safeguard issues mean this is a long-term option. \nSmall and medium sized run-of-the-river hydropower plants have shorter construction periods \nbut have seasonal and daily output variation which makes them unsuitable for base-load.14 \n                                                \n7  Measures in the National Power Policy are reinforced through agreement with International Monetary Fund (IMF). \nIMF. 2013. Pakistan: 2013 Article IV Consultation and Request for an Extended Arrangement Under the Extended \nFund Facility. Washington D.C. \n8  HFO-fired power accounts for 34% of the energy mix; at PRs15.94 per kWh, it makes up 77% of total generation \ncosts. In comparison, the hydropower cost was PRs0.16 per kWh, and gas PRs4.24 per kWh (footnote 6). The \ncost-recovery tariff has risen from PRs5.5 per kWh in 2008 to PRs14.51 per kWh in 2013. \n9  The subsidies vary monthly according to the consumer mix, load factor, and whether a periodic fuel price \nadjustment was applied during the period. The average tariff increased from PRs4.26 per kWh to PRs8.81 per kWh \nin May 2012, and further to PRs 11.11 per kWh in August 2013.  \n10 Emissions for conversion from HFO to gas fired plants would vary according to the state of the existing equipment. \nFor the Jamshoro TPS oil-fired units, after conversion the emissions would increase to 1,172 grams of CO  per \n2\nkWh using imported sub-bituminus coal.   \n11 Fuel cost savings between a new HFO fired power generation plant and the project would be $535 million annually.  \n12 Hydropower\u2019s share declined as follows: 72% (1980), 54% (1990), 35% (2000), 32% (2012). \n13 Government of Pakistan, National Transmission and Despatch Company. 2012. Power System Statistics 2011\u201312. \n14 Summer and winter output varies by around 3,000 MW. The government has spent $20 million for the feasibility \nstudy of 4,500MW Diamer Basha Dam. The cost is estimated at $12 billion and construction period of 10 years. \nRanking of priority projects and sector roadmap are set out in Friends of Democratic Pakistan. 2012. A Productive \nand Water-Secure Pakistan. Islamabad. ", "3 \nDomestic gas-fired generation will decline from the current 26% with the depletion of existing \ngas  fields,  and  competing  demand  from  industry,  transport,  and  retail  customers  unless \ndomestic gas supplies are increased.15 The abundant wind and solar resources are being \ndeveloped, but their outputs are variable and would not meet the base-load requirements.  \n \n8.  Power generation mix. Oil-fired power generation is expensive, and used for less than \n5% of world generation. To be competitive economically, Pakistan cannot afford continued \nreliance on expensive imported oil for 34% of power generation. Pakistan has one of the lowest \ncarbon  emissions,  19%  of the  world\u2019s  average.16 Coal  reserves  in  Pakistan  may generate \n10,000 MW of power for 350 years. Globally, coal-based power plants generate 40% of power,17 \nbut account for just 0.07% of generation in Pakistan.18  \n \n9.  ADB interventions. ADB is engaged in the energy sector through its four multitranche \nfinancing facilities and private sector investments, which fund energy efficiency, transmission, \ndistribution, and renewable energy projects including eight hydropower and two  wind power \nprojects.19 As the sector\u2019s largest donor, ADB conducts policy dialogue on reforms, planning, and \nprovides sector assessments to the International Monetary Fund. Ongoing reforms follow the \nrecommendations of the Friends of Democratic Pakistan Energy Sector Task Force, which ADB \nco-chaired with the government. The report addresses diversification of existing fuel sources.20  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The project\u2019s impact will be an enhanced energy supply in Pakistan. The outcome will be \na more efficient energy mix through diversification from expensive HFO to less expensive coal.    \n \nC.  Outputs \n11.  The project will (i) increase capacity of the Jamshoro TPS by installing a 600-MW (net) \nsupercritical coal-fired unit, using an 80/20 blend of imported sub-bituminous coal and domestic \nlignite when available,21 and provide 5 years of operation and maintenance (O&M) support; (ii) \nensure compliance with the national environmental standards (install emission control devices \nfor the existing units and remediating the site);22 (iii) enhance capacity of GENCO Holding \nCompany  Limited  (GHCL)  and  Jamshoro  Power  Company  Limited  (JPCL)  by  providing \nfinancial, technical, and operational training; and (iv) introduce education on coal-fired plant \noperation. The infrastructure will support government\u2019s plan to have an additional 600-MW unit \nat the same site. The design includes a flue duct interface that will allow adding carbon capture \nand storage (CCS) when the technology is available.23   \n                                                \n15 Natural gas imports are being explored through pipeline gas and liquefied natural gas. The projects have faced \ndelays. ADB has been the secretariat for the project to pipe gas from Turkmenistan to Pakistan since 2003. \n16  Pakistan\u2018s carbon emission per capita is 0.81 tons per year according to the International Energy Agency. 2012.  \nCO  Emissions from Fuel Combustion.

The government requested two loans totaling $870 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources (OCR) to finance a portion of the project. The first loan of $840 million (OCR Loan 1) \nwill have a 30-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, and will finance civil works. The \nsecond loan of $30 million (OCR Loan 2) will have a 20-year term, including a grace period of \n10 years, and will finance O&M, and consulting services during the construction phase. The \nOCR loans will have an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility,24 a commitment charge of 0.15% per year \n(the interest and other charges during construction to be capitalized in the loans), and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. The government \nalso requested a loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR19,380,000 from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources to help finance the remaining portion of the project. The loan will have a 25-\nyear term, including a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate of 2% per annum during the \ngrace period and thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and \nproject agreements. The loan will finance consulting services during the implementation phase \nand for capacity development. In the event that cofinancing from IDB is not forthcoming, the \ngovernment will take all necessary and appropriate steps to make available all counterpart \n                                                \n24 The interest includes a maturity premium of 20 basis points for OCR Loan 1.

The government will \nrelend to JPCL the OCR Loan 1 and IDB loan proceeds at LIBOR+450 basis points, which is in \nline with the rate previously allowed by the regulator for passing the tariff onto customers. For \nOCR Loan 1, the term of the relending will be 30 years, including a grace period of 5 years.  The \ngovernment will also relend to JPCL the OCR Loan 2 proceeds, in local currency equivalent, \nwith interest at the rate of 15% per annum inclusive of foreign exchange risk, and a term of 20 \nyears, including a grace period of 10 years. The government will relend to JPCL the ADF loan \nproceeds, in local currency equivalent, with interest at the rate of 15% per annum inclusive of \nforeign exchange risk, and a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years.    \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements  \n \n14.   GHCL will be the executing agency, JPCL the implementing agency, and the Ministry of \nWater and Power the oversight body.25 A project management unit with sufficient staff will be \nestablished within GHCL, with a project implementation unit established in Jamshoro TPS. The \nengineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor selected to build the plant will \nprovide 5 years O&M support after commissioning as part of its contract.26 In order to facilitate \nthe government\u2019s plan for a second unit (for which there is currently insufficient financing), \nbidders will be required to bid for an optional second unit on same terms, conditions, and price. \nThis option will be valid for 30 months after award of the first unit. Should actual costs for output \n1 of the project be lower than the estimate, residual funds from OCR Loan 1 may be used for a \nsecond  600-MW  supercritical  unit  at  the  same  site  that  meets  all  ADB  policies  and \nrequirements. At that stage, suitable due diligence will be carried out and approval sought. \nInternational competitive bidding (ICB) will be used to select contractors for installation of flue \ngas desulfurization (FGD) for existing plants and remediation of the site. A contractor for site \npreparation will be selected through  national competitive bidding. A project implementation \nconsultant (PIC) firm will be recruited using quality- and cost-based selection method.27 The \ncoal  supplier(s)  will  be  selected  through  ICB,  with  assistance  from  the  PIC.  The  project \nenvisages advance contracting and retroactive financing of up to 20% of total financing.

It is proposed to expand country eligibility for procurement of the EPC contract to build \nthe coal-fired power plant by allowing this procurement in both ADB and IDB member countries. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical  \n \n16.   Jamshoro TPS was selected because of its proximity to Bin Qasim Port and the existing \nrail system for importation of coal, land availability, and construction access. Jamshoro TPS \ncurrently has one oil-fired and three oil and gas dual-fired power generation units, with 850 MW \ninstalled of which 700 MW is available.30 Coal will be delivered by ship and then transported by \ntrain from Bin Qasim Port (160 kilometers from Jamshoro TPS). The railway tracks are in good \ncondition and there are sufficient facilities at the port to handle the amount of coal needed for \nthe  project.  Moreover,  the  railway  line  will  be  rehabilitated  and  new  locomotives  will  be \npurchased for the project to ensure reliable delivery.31 A medium-term coal supply agreement \nwill be signed before EPC contract award.32 Water is supplied via intake pipelines in the Indus \nRiver;  an  additional  pump  station  and  pipelines  will  be  constructed for  the  new  unit,  with \nwastewater returned to the river after treatment. A new 500-kilovolt transmission line with 1,500-\nMW  transmission  capacity,  financed  through  tranche  3  of  ADB\u2019s  Power  Transmission \nEnhancement Investment Program, will evacuate the generated power.33  \n \n17.  To  achieve  affordability,  energy  security,  reliable  base-load  and  diversification  from \nHFO, coal-fired power plants are the optimal medium term option. Most countries begin coal-\nfired generation with subcritical plants; these are easier to operate, more rugged, and more \n                                                \n29 This cofinancing will be provided on parallel basis and will not be administered by ADB.  \n30 In 2012, Jamshoro TPS generated only 20% of its installed capacity because of a lack of fuel. \n31 A coal transport agreement that includes coal unloading and satisfactory safety measures will be signed prior to the \ncoal supply contract award. A private sector concession will be considered by the Pakistan Railway Authority. \n32 The coal supply contract (minimum 3 years) has been advertised in local and international newspapers. \n33 The power purchase agreement will include penalties for the transmission company if the transmission line is not \navailable when the project is commissioned. An additional 1,320 MW of power can be reliably transmitted from \nJamshoro to the national grid according to the transmission load study. ADB. 2006. Report and Recommendation \nof the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Multitranche Financing Facility to the Islamic Republic of \nPakistan for the Power Transmission Enhancement Investment Program. Manila.  ", "7 \nreliable than supercritical plants, but have higher emissions and lower efficiency. As envisioned \nin ADB's Energy Policy,34 during project development supercritical technology was introduced \nby ADB ensuring cleaner technology to Pakistan. The CO emission savings comparing the two \n2 \ntechnologies is estimated at 400,000 tons of CO per year.35  \n2 \n \n18.  A mix of 20% domestic lignite and 80% imported sub-bituminous coal is the optimal \ndesign, based on the technological, economic, and environmental analysis. The boiler system \nwith single reheater will perform at no less than 93.5% efficiency at low heating value with this \nblend. The unit will be equipped with a wet scrubber with limestone FGD, which will remove at \nleast  95%  of  sulfur  dioxide  (SO )  from  exhaust  flue  gases.  A  highly  efficient  (>99.9%) \n2\nelectrostatic precipitator will be installed to remove fine particles from the exhaust gases and \nminimize the particulates. A low nitrogen oxides (NO ) burner combined with stage combustion \nx\nwill be used and a selective catalytic reduction process will be used to further reduce NO  \nx\nemissions. The project will finance FGDs for existing oil-fired units at Jamshoro TPS to further \nreduce SO  emissions if necessary to meet environmental standards.36  \n2\n \n19.  The  project  will  reduce  power  shortage  and  replace  informal  sources  of  power \ngeneration,  which  is  expected  to  offset  about  503,000  tons  of  the  plant\u2019s  CO   emissions \n2\nannually.37  Compared with subcritical coal-fired power generation and existing Jamshoro units \nusing  HFO,  the  project  would  emit  388,000  tons  and  639,000  tons  less  CO (footnote  5) \n2 \nannually.  Reflecting  ADB\u2019s  broad-based  involvement  in  the  sector,  ADB\u2019s  overall  Pakistan \nenergy portfolio is CO  negative with an expected reduction of 3.5 million tons from existing \n2\nprojects annually. To further reduce the carbon footprint, the PIC will also assess additional \noptions to offset GHG emissions through reforestation. Ash produced from the unit is expected \nto be recycled; however, 100 acres of available land will be purchased for a lined ash disposal \npond to store the ash in case there is a lag in demand from cement plants and other potential \ncustomers. If ash recycling agreements cannot be signed by the commissioning, JPCL will \npurchase additional 200 acres of land in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009) and resettlement plan. Ash Management Plan is detailed in the PAM (footnote 28).  The \ncooling  system  will  need  to  withstand  extreme  hot  summer  weather,  and  the  bidders  will \npropose optimal solutions including an air, wet, or hybrid cooling system. The system will be \ndesigned, supplied, and installed by an EPC contractor. Construction will take 40\u201248 months. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial  \n20.  The  project  adopts  a  least-cost  approach  to  enhancing  power  generation  capacity. \nProject  economic  viability  was  assessed  based  on  expected  benefits  and  costs  over  the \nproject\u2019s economic life. The project is economically viable, with an economic internal rate of \nreturn  of  36.3%,  exceeding  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital  of  12%.  Incremental \nrevenues arising from sale of electricity were calculated based on willingness to pay, estimated \n                                                \n34 ADB. 2009. Energy Policy. Manila. \n35 The supercritical technology is well established but is slightly less efficient than ultra-supercritical plants. Ultra-\nsupercritical plants require experienced operators because of their exacting design. At a low heating value, an \nultra-supercritical plant can reach an efficiency of 45%, a supercritical plant 44%, and subcritical technology 38%. \n36 If the existing units are shut down after commissioning of the new supercritical units, FGD will not be necessary. If \nthey are run on high-sulfur HFO or converted to coal-fired units, FGD is required.  \n37 Estimated 31% of the electricity generated from the project will replace informal power generation. Ash recycling \nwill result in offsetting 115,000 tons of CO2 emissions. The project\u2019s comprehensive monitoring program for GHG \nemissions will include the installation of a continuous emission monitoring system and third-party monitoring. \n ", "8 \nat  PRs21  per kWh  based  on  a  survey.38 In the financial  analysis  the  project  benefit  was \ncalculated as per NEPRA guidelines for coal-fired generation projects. By applying the financing \nterms and other commercial parameters of the project,39 the tariff was PRs8.88 per kWh. The \nfinancial internal rate of return of the project in real terms is 8.7%, which compares favorably \nwith the estimated weighted average cost of capital of  6.7%, indicating that the project is \nfinancially viable. Sensitivity analysis shows robustness under unfavorable circumstances.  \n \nC.  Governance \n \n21.  Procurement. The implementing agency\u2019s capacity to implement procurement of this \ntype is low, and the inherent procurement risks are high due to the contract value and technical \ncomplexity. The PIC consultant will undertake day-to-day management of the procurement \nprocess, including ensuring that due diligence is conducted on the proposals, and the findings \nare included in the bid evaluation and recommendations. Based on PIC\u2019s recommendation, the \nproject steering committee will consider (i) evaluation reports and award recommendations, (ii) \nplant design and any changes during implementation, (iii) the implementation plan, and (iv) \ncontract variations. ADB\u2019s concurrence is requested after project steering committee\u2019s approval.  \n \n22.  The  financial  management  assessment  of  the  implementing  agency  is  generally \nsatisfactory,  with  accepted  accounting  principles  and  conventions  in  compliance  with \ninternational financial reporting standards being applied. The implementing agency has been \naudited by external international audit firms. The company suffers from losses primarily because \nof the sector\u2019s liquidity crisis. The financial rehabilitation roadmap with specific milestones was \ndeveloped to improve the financial sustainability of the implementing agency (footnote 28). \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with \nthe executing and implementing agencies. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 28). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social  \n23.  The project will result in a more reliable electric power supply, and help in meeting peak \ndemand,  which  is  expected  to  benefit  industrial  productivity.  Industrial  production  and \nmanufacturing  contribute  about  25%  of  GDP,  and  are  responsible  for  18%  of  formal \nemployment.  Opportunities  for  women\u2019s  employment  in  manufacturing  are  important,  with \nwomen holding 30% of formal jobs in the textile industry. The project will employ 1,600 people \nfor construction and equipment installation. In line with international norms, about 175 staff will \nbe hired for O&M of the new unit.  \n \nE.  Safeguards  \n24.  Environment. This project is categorized as \u201cA\u201d for environment. The project will benefit \nthe environment by addressing the existing environmental damage and restoring the site, and by \nsignificantly reducing the sulfur emissions of power generated (per kWh) in comparison with \nexisting generation using high-sulfur HFO. In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009), an environmental audit of the existing facility and environmental impact assessment study \nof the planned two new units were prepared, with the drafts disclosed on 26 June 2013. The new \n                                                \n38 Four consumer categories were surveyed: residential, agricultural, commercial, and industrial. For a 12% economic \ninternal rate of return, the willingness to pay would be PRs8.71 per kWh, which is below the average tariff.  \n39 A 6% interest rate and 17.45% return on equity was applied. The per-unit price of indigenous coal was assumed to \nbe the same as the per-unit price of imported coal. $120.6 per ton was used. There is no domestic market for the \nquantity of coal needed. ", "9 \ncoal-fired unit will produce ash and soot, requiring specific handling (para. 19). Site remediation will \naddress existing contamination issues, such as oil-contaminated soil, waste metals, and asbestos \ndisposal. Mitigation measures supported under this project include (i) effluent water management, \n(ii) construction of a hazardous waste storage facility, (iii) development of a landfill site for colony \nwaste,  (iv)  rehabilitation  of  evaporation  ponds,  (v)  emissions  control  measures  to  address \nexcessive SO emissions, and (vi) ash disposal and traffic management. The implementing agency \n2 \nwill implement an annual comprehensive monitoring program to measure GHG emissions and \neffluent. Training will be held for engineers to mainstream environmental safeguards. The project is \nestimated to emit 3.3 million tons of CO  annually using an 80/20 blend of imported sub-bituminous \n2\ncoal and domestic lignite. Background levels of fine particulate matter (less than 2.5 microns in \ndiameter [PM ]) in the project area exceed the applicable standards.40 The high levels of PM  are \n2.5 2.5\nattributed to informal power generation41 using dirty fuels and less efficient generation,42 and are at \npresent widely used to meet the country\u2019s power shortages. An offset for the plant\u2019s emissions of \nPM  will be designed and implemented, under technical assistance, through further assessment \n2.5\nof air quality and pollution sources within the airshed.   \n \n25.  Social.  The  project  is  categorized  as  \u201cB\u201d  for  resettlement  and  \u201cC\u201d  for  indigenous \npeoples. Approximately 100 acres of land belonging to 18 landowners (with a total of 106 family \nmembers) is required for an ash pond at Jamshoro TPS. Consultations were held with the \nowners  and  they  are  willing  to  negotiate  with  JPCL  on  the  price.  A  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement plan was prepared and disclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 19 September 2013; it will \nbe updated to reflect the final list of owners and price agreed between the owners and JPCL. \n \nF.
