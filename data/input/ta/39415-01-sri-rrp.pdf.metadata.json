THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) proposed \nloans to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Sustainable Power Sector \nSupport  Project,  and  (ii)  proposed  administration  of  technical  assistance  (TA)  grant  for \nImplementation of Energy Efficiency Policy Initiatives to be provided by the Asian Clean Energy \nFund1 under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility. \n \n2.  The project2 will include three components: (i) transmission system strengthening to \nimprove its reliability and enable rural electrification in Eastern, North Central, Southern, and \nUva provinces; (ii) rural electrification and distribution system improvement in Eastern and Uva \nprovinces  to  expand  access for the  poor  and rural  households;  and (iii)  energy  efficiency \nimprovement and renewable energy development.3  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  power  sector  struggles  to  meet  the  growing  demand  for  electricity  at \nsufficiently low cost and acceptable reliability. The share of thermal energy in the generation mix \nhas increased from 6% in 1995 to 61% in 2010 as demand growth has been generally met by \noil-fired thermal generation. This type of power generation makes electricity expensive because \nof  high  fuel  prices,  and  poses  a  serious  threat  to  the  country\u2019s  energy  security  and  the \nenvironment. The transmission system is too weak to meet the growing demand in the regions. \nSubstantial investments are required to strengthen the transmission network and improve its \nreliability. About 15% of households\u2014primarily those in rural areas\u2014do not have access to \nelectricity  despite  the  government\u2019s  intensive  investment  program  to  expand  the  rural \ndistribution network. The electrification ratio of 67.3% in Eastern Province4 is the lowest among \nall of Sri Lanka\u2019s provinces and is well below the average national electrification ratio of 85.4% \nin 2009.5 Uva Province is another lagging region with an electrification ratio of 70% as of 2009. \nThere is an urgent need to develop clean energy and indigenous renewable energy sources, \nreduce losses, and improve energy efficiency. \n \n4.  The  project  will  support  Sri  Lanka's  national  and  sector  priorities  as  stated  in  the \ncountry's 10-year development framework prepared in 2006, which focuses on infrastructure \ndevelopment to accelerate economic growth and narrow regional disparities. The project is also \nin line with the National Energy Policy and Strategies (NEPS), a 10-year plan for the energy \nsector, covering a period up to 2016. The NEPS envisions sustainable development of energy \nresources, conversion facilities, and delivery systems to enable access to and use of energy \nservices by the entire population, as well as the safe, reliable delivery of such energy services at \na competitive price. The NEPS provides a comprehensive sector road map and includes a long-\nterm  investment  program  with  specific  policy  and  reform  measures.  It  aims  to  (i)  supply \nelectricity to 86% of households by 2010 and 98% by 2016, and (ii) ensure electricity tariffs are \n                                                \n1  Established by the Government of Japan. \n2  ADB. 2009.

Statistical Digest. ", "2 \ncompetitive  with  those  in  other  countries  and  sufficient  for  utilities  to  be  viable.  The \ngovernment\u2019s main goals are to improve the quantity, quality, and cost of service delivery, and \nto increase electricity connections in rural areas. \n \n5.  The project is consistent with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country partnership \nstrategy for Sri Lanka,6 which focuses on (i) funding transmission projects  to remove grid \nconstraints on absorbing additional capacity from renewable energy sources, (ii) improving \nenergy  efficiency  and  reliability  by  strengthening  the  transmission  network,  (iii)  expanding \naccess to electricity by improving connectivity for the poor, and (iv) mitigating climate change by \nfinancing clean energy projects and supporting energy efficiency initiatives. The project will \nsupport  the  sustainable  development  of  the  power  sector  in  line  with  national  and  sector \npriorities,  the  country  partnership  strategy,  and  complement  activities  of  other  major \ndevelopment partners.7 The project will expand ADB interventions in the power sector initiated \nunder the Clean Energy and Access Improvement Project,8 which was designed to support \nsector reforms following approval of the Sri Lanka Electricity Act in March 2009.9 The project will \naddress  the  post-conflict  electricity  needs  of  the  population  and  improve  infrastructure  in \nEastern Province that was severely damaged by the conflict, and directly contribute to the \ndevelopment  of  this  poor  province. 10  The  project  will  strengthen  the  220-kilovolt  (kV) \ntransmission  line  that  is  vital  to  the  overall  reliability  of  the  transmission  system  and  the \nevacuation  of  power  from  renewable  hydropower  sources\u2014primarily  located  in  Central \nProvince\u2014to the conflict-affected northern part of the country through North Central Province. \nTo ensure regional balance, the project is also designed to benefit other poor provinces. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The project will contribute to a reliable, adequate, and affordable power supply for \nsustainable economic growth and poverty reduction in Sri Lanka. The outcome of the project will \nbe improved coverage, efficiency, and reliability in the delivery of electricity.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n7.

Economic  and  financial  analyses  were  undertaken  for  the  project.23 The  economic \ninternal  rate  of  return  was  calculated  by  comparing  \u2015with-project\u2016  and  \u2015without-project\u2016 \nscenarios.  Detailed  cost\u2013benefit  calculations  were  used  to  assess  and  confirm  economic \nviability and sustainability. The economic analysis confirms that the proposed investment is \nleast cost and economically viable. The analysis yields an overall economic internal rate of \nreturn  of  23.0%.  A  sensitivity  and  risk  analysis  demonstrates  that  the  expected  economic \nperformance is robust.  \n \n20.  The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) was calculated to determine the financial \nviability of the project. Financial viability was examined by comparing the incremental costs and \nbenefits on a \u2015with investment\u2016 and \u2015without investment\u2016 basis. The weighted average cost of \ncapital (WACC) to CEB was calculated for each subproject and for the overall project. Financial \nviability was assessed by comparing the WACC to the FIRR for each subproject and for the \naggregated  project.  The  sensitivity  of  the  FIRR  to  adverse  movements  in  the  underlying \nassumptions was also assessed. The overall FIRR to CEB is 10.8%. These returns compare \nfavorably with the estimated WACC. The overall project is deemed financially viable. \n \nB.  Governance \n \n21.  With  its  substantial  experience  in  implementing  externally  funded  projects  including \nthose financed by ADB, the World Bank, Japan International Cooperation Agency, and bilateral \ndevelopment partners, CEB has the necessary capacity to handle the project. CEB is the \nimplementing agency for ADB's Clean Energy and Access Improvement Project (footnote 8), \nand  is  implementing  a  power  sector  component  of  the  ADB\u2019s  Conflict-Affected  Region \nEmergency  Project  (footnote  10).  A  financial  management  assessment  was  undertaken  to \ndetermine whether CEB could fulfill ADB\u2019s fiduciary requirements for the project. Details are \navailable in the project administration manual (footnote 21) and in the assessment of CEB\u2019s \npast financial performance and projections.24 \n \n22.  In recent years, SEA has received considerable capacity development assistance from \nits development partners, including ADB25 and the Japan International Cooperation Agency, and \nwill  be  undertaking  technical  due  diligence  of  applications  for  the  estate  micro-hydro \nrehabilitation and repowering sub-component, and limited procurement activities for energy \nefficiency lighting equipment.  \n \n                                                \n22  Established by the Government of Japan. \n23  Economic Analysis and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24  CEB\u2019s Past Financial Performance and Projections (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25  ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for Building the Capacity of the \nSustainable Energy Authority. Manila (TA 7011-SRI, approved on 12 December, for $600,000 with financing from \nthe Multi-Donor Clean Energy Fund under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility administered by ADB. \nContributors to the fund are the governments of Australia, Norway, Spain, and Sweden). \n ", "8 \n23.  Procurement will be subject to ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). Recruitment of consultants will be in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Use of open competitive bidding, \ntransparency in the selection of projects, and ADB oversight will ensure integrity in procurement \nand implementation activities. CEB and SEA will maintain a project website that will be updated \nregularly and will include (i) bidding procedures, bidders, and contract awards; (ii) use of the \nfunds disbursed under the project; and (iii) physical progress. ADB's Anticorruption Policy (1998, \nas amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government, MOPE, CEB, and \nSEA.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are  described  in  the \nproject administration manual (footnote 21). \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n24.  The project will contribute to sustainable economic development, poverty reduction, and \nsocial well-being26 through increased access to electricity, reduction of system losses, and \nimprovement in the quality of power. Greater access to a stable supply of electricity will promote \nbusiness expansion and increase jobs, which will help reduce poverty. The project is expected \nto generate jobs for skilled and unskilled laborers during construction. Access to electricity will \nalso improve the living standards of rural households. These will include health and hygiene \nimprovements through the replacement of kerosene and wood use, increases in the educational \nlevel of children as they can devote more time to studying, and wider access to information.  \n \n25.  The project is classified under effective gender mainstreaming.27 It includes activities to \nimprove the livelihoods of local communities, especially for women. Where households headed \nby women are affected, the project will implement special livelihood restoration provisions to \nensure that their vulnerability is adequately addressed.28 Affordability is not likely to be an issue \nas  the  government  generally  subsidizes  electricity,  especially  for  poor  and  disadvantaged \ncustomers. Poor households will be provided with a credit line (footnote 12).  \n \nD.  Safeguards \n \n  1.  Social Safeguards \n \n26.  None of the project components will have a significant social impact. The transmission \nand distribution lines primarily cross public and unused lands. Where crop fields might be \naffected, households will be fairly compensated for the loss. Construction will be carried out \nduring the off-season for crops. New grid substations will be built on public land, and the project \nmay mount the distribution transformers on poles to minimize their footprint.  \n \n27.  The project is classified category B for involuntary resettlement issues. CEB prepared a \nresettlement plan for the transmission strengthening and rural electrification and distribution \nimprovement components (footnote 28). The project is classified category C for indigenous \npeoples issues since no indigenous peoples will be directly affected by the project. \n   \n                                                \n26   Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n27   Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). The Improving Gender-inclusive \nAccess to Clean and Renewable Energy in Bhutan, Nepal, and Sri Lanka is being processed separately for \napproval. \n28  Provisions are in the Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \n  2.  Environmental Safeguards \n \n28.  CEB and SEA have prepared initial environmental examinations29 for their components \nand held public consultation meetings. During construction and operation, steps will be taken to \nminimize  environmental  impacts,  particularly  those  associated  with  the  construction  of \ntransmission lines. CEB has observed the route-selection criteria in the national regulations and \nhas  adopted  best  environmental  practices.  Adequate  provisions  have  been  made  for  the \nenvironmental mitigation measures, monitoring requirements, and their associated costs in the \nenvironmental management plans (EMPs) prepared for each subproject. CEB has sufficient \ncapacity  to  implement  the  safeguard  measures  based  on  the  EMPs.  Mitigation  measures \nrelated to construction and specified in the EMPs will be incorporated into civil works contracts. \nThe contractors will have primary responsibility for implementing the mitigation measures during \nconstruction, but CEB will be responsible for overall implementation of its site-specific EMPs. \nSEA will be responsible for overall implementation of its site-specific EMPs for the estate micro-\nhydro rehabilitation and repowering pilot sub-component. SEA will be supported by safeguard \nconsultants. CEB and SEA will adhere to ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), and local \nand government environmental regulations. The project is classified environmental category B. \n \n3.  Climate Change Impact \n \n29.  The project is expected to have a considerable climate change impact. Its renewable \nenergy intervention will bring an additional 1.3 MW of power generation to the grid, which is \nequivalent to avoiding about 4,140 tons of carbon dioxide (CO ) emissions per year.30 The \n2\nenergy efficiency policy initiatives supported by the project and the associated TA are expected \nto produce about 480 gigawatt-hours of energy savings, resulting in 353,787 tons of  CO  \n2\nemissions equivalent avoided per year by 2015. A reduction of 147,745 tons of CO  emissions \n2\nper  year  may  be  achieved  through  additional  household  connections  and  technical  loss \nreduction from the improved energy efficiency of the transmission and distribution lines by 2015. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n30.  The  potential  governance  risk  stems  from  CEB  having  insufficient  cash  to  fund  its \noperations  because  of (i)  an  increase  in fuel oil  costs  and reliance on  expensive  thermal \nelectricity generation, (ii) delays in commissioning less costly generating capacity, and (iii) tariffs \nset below the cost of supply. The potential risks to project implementation include unexpected \nincreases in the prices of commodities and raw materials, and delays in implementation that \nraise  project  costs. These risks  appear to  be  moderate  and  may  be mitigated through  (i) \nprogress on power sector reforms, and government efforts to increase supply capacity and \nreduce the cost of generation; and (ii) close supervision by the steering committee and ADB, \ntimely project implementation, and advance contracting. Major risks and mitigating measures \nare described in the risk assessment and risk management plan.31 \n \nV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n31.  The  government  and  MOPE  have  assured  ADB  that  project  implementation  shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \n                                                \n29   Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n30  In addition, a reduction of 97,200 tons of CO  emissions per year may be achieved from commissioning the \n2\nMoragolla hydropower plant (about 30 MW) upon completion of a detailed engineering design and its construction. \n31 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nin the project administration manual and draft loan documents. The government and MOPE \nhave agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are set forth in the draft loan \nand project agreements. \n \n32.  Disbursement of the credit line for estate micro-hydro rehabilitation and repowering will \nbe subject to the following conditions: \n \n(i)  approval of selection criteria for micro-hydro project developers and participating \nfinancial institution(s) by the government and ADB; \n(ii)  approval and publication of net metering regulations, a standardized agreement, \nand  technical  connection  requirements  by  CEB  and  the  Public  Utilities \nCommission, including announcements on raising the export capacity limit of the \nnet metered renewable energy facility from 42 kW up to 300 kW, introduction of a \nregister-and-exempt licensing procedure by the Public Utilities Commission, and \na simplified process for granting energy permits for micro-hydro projects by SEA; \n(iii)  selection of an eligible participating financial institution(s)32 satisfactory to ADB;  \n(iv)  execution  of  a  subsidiary  financing  agreement  between  SEA,  eligible \nparticipating financial institution(s) and the government in form and substance \nsatisfactory to ADB. \n \nVI.
