The ongoing global economic and financial crisis has underscored the importance of \nmaintaining the stability and soundness of financial and economic systems across the globe. In \nan increasingly interlinked global economy, distress in one market can easily spill over to the \nworld\u2019s financial markets and into the real economy. Asia, which earlier appeared relatively \nimmune  to  fallout  from  the  financial  crisis,  is  now  facing  greater  risks  due  to  the  global \nslowdown. Recent discussions at the Group of 20 (G-20) Summit1  highlighted the need to take \ndecisive and bold actions at the individual country level as well as to closely coordinate across \nnational boundaries to counter the scale and global nature of the crisis. \n \n2.  The global economic and financial crisis is impacting South Asia at a time when it was \nalready preoccupied with the adverse effects of a severe terms-of-trade shock (reflected in a \nworsening of macroeconomic balances) and strong inflationary pressures.  Policymakers in \nSouth Asia (as elsewhere in the world) now face the challenge of simultaneously coping with a \nsudden recession in most developed economies, a collapse in commodity prices, a severe \nliquidity crunch, and, most of all, loss of confidence. If the current crisis persists, its impact on \ngrowth  is  likely  to  be  pronounced  and  could  significantly  delay  the  region\u2019s  achieving  its \ndevelopment  goals  toward  poverty  reduction  and  inclusive  growth.  Particularly  for  smaller \neconomies in the region with large balance-of-payments and fiscal deficits, adverse impact to \ngrowth will be significant.  Such countries will have larger financing and adjustment needs and if \ncapital dries up, this will put a deep strain on the balance sheets of domestic firms and banks, \npotentially  leading  to  a  cascade  of  bankruptcies  and  bank  failures.  There  is  a  growing \nconsensus that much can and should be done to address weaknesses in South Asian financial \nsystems as well as to restore growth and stability in the real economy. Despite its being the \nleast financially integrated subregion, the global crisis confronts South Asia (in varying degrees) \nwith daunting macroeconomic challenges. \n \n3.  Following the recently concluded joint Asian Development Bank (ADB) and The World \nBank\u2019s South Asia Bond Markets Conference2 in Hong Kong, developing member countries \n(DMCs) in South Asia suggested that ADB support for exchange of views and learning from \nexperiences  in  the  context  of  the  evolving  economic  and  financial  crisis  necessitate \nconsideration  particularly  for  smaller  economies.  Accordingly,  the  proposed  research  and \ndevelopment technical assistance (TA) project provides a forum for discussions among South \nAsian and other DMCs on national and regional responses to the crisis in dealing with systemic \nrisks,  identify  mechanisms  that  could  maintain  financial  stability  and  shore  up  investor \nconfidence, and assist in designing and implementing fiscal and investment strategies and \npolicies to stimulate the domestic economies. In-depth status papers will be prepared and \ninternational experts will be invited to facilitate knowledge sharing in the forums. The proposed \nTA will feed into broader interventions planned by the Asian Development Bank Institute. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.3  \n \n \n                                                 \n1  The meeting of the G-20 leaders at the Summit on Financial Markets and the World Economy in Washington on \nNovember 15, 2008. The G-20 is a group of finance ministers and central bank governors from 20 economies, \nnamely: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, People\u2019s Republic of China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, \nJapan, Republic of Korea, Mexico, Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, Republic of South Africa, Turkey, United \nKingdom, United States, and European Union. \n2  ADB. 2008. Small Scale Technical Assistance for South Asian Bond Markets Conference. Manila (SSTA 6487 \napproved on 12 September 2008, for $66,000) \n3   The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of the ADB website on 5 December 2008. \n ", "2   \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  The bursting of the real estate bubble in the United States triggered the current global \neconomic and financial crisis, resulting in unprecedented losses to financial institutions having \neither  direct  or  indirect  exposure  to  mortgages,  including  through  asset-backed  securities. \nThese  losses  have  considerably  weakened  financial  structures  that  now  necessitate \ngovernment bailouts to prevent them from collapsing.    \n \n5.  Although most Asian countries remain relatively closed economies, they nevertheless \nare exposed to the contagion effect of instability in global debt and equity markets that is leading \nto capital outflows, reduced capital inflows, and tightening credit in the international financial \nmarkets. Nonetheless, the risk  exposure is not the kind that devastated many East Asian \neconomies during the Asian financial crisis of 1998 to 1999. This may be attributed to the \nfollowing (i) the current crisis is not of the homegrown variety but is an imported one; (ii) South \nAsian financial institutions\u2019 direct exposure to subprime-related structured products is relatively \nlimited; (iii) countries in South Asia had undertaken reforms to strengthen prudential regulations \nand,  in  particular,  risk  management  practices following  the  Asian  financial  crisis,  including \ndeveloping more resilient financial systems; and (iv) because South Asian countries\u2019 capital \naccounts are still not convertible, they are much less exposed to turbulence in global capital \nmarkets.   \n \n6.  Asia\u2019s economic and financial systems have nevertheless come under pressure. As the \nglobal  credit  crunch  intensified,  Asia\u2019s  main  export  markets  in  North  America  and  Europe \nsuddenly contracted. Repricing of financial risks has sharply deteriorated Asian equity values \nand external funding conditions. Contagion may affect the region\u2019s economies and financial \nsystems more seriously if tightening credit conditions and financial instability affect broader \neconomic activity within the region. In South Asia, signs of increasing stress are evident. T-bill \nand eurodollar (TED)4  spreads remain high in countries such as India and Sri Lanka. Trade \nfinancing is becoming scarce and various economies in the region face large and uncertain \namortization of short-term debt. Tighter credit means less private investments in South Asia to \nfinance priority development needs including infrastructure, health, education, and technological \ninnovation, thereby posing a considerable threat to the region\u2019s long-term growth potential and \nability to continue rapidly reducing poverty. Accordingly, it is important to facilitate an exchange \nof views on possible downside risks over the short to medium term, on measures that can \nreduce these risks, on how to develop domestic policies and programs to counter collapse of \nexternal demand, and on possible regional efforts to reduce the impact of global instability in \nSouth Asia.  A summary assessment of the global economic and financial crisis is available as a \nsupplementary appendix. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n7.  To address the evolving implications of the global economic and financial crisis in South \nAsia, the TA will engage South Asia and DMCs in the region to exchange views and explore \nongoing and planned initiatives at country, subregional, and regional levels to address the crisis \nand the adverse impact on domestic economic and financial stability.  \n \n8.  Specifically, this TA will engage participants in an open dialogue on the following issues: \n \n                                                 \n4  The TED spread is the difference between the interest rates on interbank loans and short-term United States \ngovernment debt (\"T-bills\"). The TED spread is an indicator of perceived credit risk in the general economy. \n ", "  3\n(i)  The impact of financial contagion on the economies of South Asia, across the \nmacroeconomic (including gross domestic product growth, job creation, inflation, \nprivate and official capital flows, and the balance of payments) and financial \nsectors (including debt and equity markets).  \n(ii)  Policy responses that countries have adopted to address financial turbulence, as \nwell as additional preventive and/or mitigation measures to be adopted should \nthe situation deteriorate further. These could include monetary, exchange rate, \nand  fiscal  policy  measures;  prudential  oversight  of  bank  capital  to  improve \nliquidity  management;  and  enhancing  financial  system  surveillance  while \nstrengthening international best practices (including International Organization of \nSecurities  Commission  principles,  strengthened  Basel  II  frameworks,  and \nFinancial Stability Forum principles). \n(iii)  Impacts of the crisis on international private capital flows and domestic private \ninvestment and, therefore, on countries\u2019 overall investment programs, including in \ninfrastructure development wherever public\u2013private partnership is an important \nmodality. \n(iv)  The possible nature of domestic stimulus packages to counter adverse affects of \nlower external demand and of possibly declining private investment and capital \ninflows. \n(v)  The regional dimension of the crisis and, in particular, of the deepening financial \ncontagion, while recognizing that investor sentiments can easily spread across \nboundaries, ensuring that protectionist policies are avoided at national level, and \navoiding other negative externalities for the region.  \n(vi)  Mechanisms that can supplement in-country systems in helping maintain stability \nin financial markets and resolve localized crises.  \n(vii)  The need for enhanced assistance from multilateral institutions, and its nature, so \nas to provide the necessary intervention in the most effective manner. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The TA\u2019s impact is to help provide (i) knowledge and sharing of in-country and global \nexperiences  to  minimize  the  adverse  effects  of,  and  cope  with,  the  global  economic  and \nfinancial crisis in the near term; (ii) relevant information that could be used by policymakers to \ndesign policies for the real sector to preserve sound economic growth and maintain investments \nin priority areas such as infrastructure development; and (iii) a foundation for more stable \nfinancial systems in South Asia by building on opportunities from the current market turbulence \nto  facilitate  exchange  of  information  and  views  on  resolution  measures  and  develop \ninternational best practices across the region\u2019s financial markets. Overall, the TA will catalyze \ndomestic  and  regional  efforts  in  addressing  possible  impacts  of  the  global  economic  and \nfinancial crisis on South Asian DMCs.  \n  \n10.  At the domestic level, the TA will build South Asian DMCs\u2019 capacity for addressing \nsystemic vulnerabilities in their financial systems; identify mechanisms for dealing with systemic \nrisks and avoiding financial instability, including possible multilateral support; open dialogue on \na continuing basis among policymakers, regulators, and practitioners regarding possible reforms \nfor enhancing governance, regulatory, and supervisory practices, as well as financial structures; \nand help bring these practices and structures into line with international best practices. \n \n11.  At the regional level, it will help identify mechanisms for dealing with the contagion \neffects of financial crisis and strengthening coordination among regional partners for regional \ncrisis management and liquidity risk management. \n ", "4   \n B.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.  The TA has four components, with key outputs and activities as follow: \n \n(i)  Component  1.  Organize  a  2-day  conference with  the  participation  of  South \nAsian policymakers, market participants, and other interested groups. \n \n(a)  First, to gain an understanding and perspective on the global economic \nand financial crisis\u2014its root causes, how to deal with risks in the near \nterm, and how future crises may be prevented. Key outputs include but \nare not limited to (1) identifying and understanding actual-to-date and \npotential future direct and indirect impacts of the ongoing global crisis on \nvarious categories of emerging market economies (e.g., categorized by \nopenness to global economy and role of international trade, size, stability, \nand  openness  of  the  financial  system,  commodity  exporters  vis-\u00e0-vis \nimporters); (2) assessing and addressing the direct and indirect impacts \nof the global crisis on individual South Asian economies (including extent \nto which potential risks facing DMCs can be addressed by their own \nactions and which risks can be mitigated only through joint actions at the \nG-20 or intermediary levels; (3) identifying specific  country measures that \ncan be undertaken immediately to stabilize the situation, drawing from \nmeasures  already  taken  by  other  countries  (especially  the  G-20)  to  \nrevive  their  respective  economies  and  financial  systems;  and \n(4) discussing long-term measures necessary to insulate existing systems \nfrom such systemic risks.  \n(b)  Second, to provide a forum for South Asian DMCs to share cross-country \nexperiences while focusing on (1) assessing the impacts of likely crisis \nscenarios  on  their  respective  financial  systems  and  real  economies, \n(2) preparing a strategy or road map of measures and mechanisms to \noffset  adverse  effects  of  the  crisis  on  their  respective  markets  and \neconomies, and (3) identifying financial and technical support needed. \n \n(ii)  Component  2.  Organize  a  follow-up  2-day  conference  to  discuss means  of \nenhancing financial stability in the region to include South Asian policymakers, \nmarket participants, and external regional associations (as observers) toward the \nfollowing. \n \n(a)  First, a discussion of alternative mechanisms and measures that DMCs \nwithin the region can implement, including, among others (1) monitoring \nof  systemic  risks.  This  can  include  such  measures  as  establishing  a \nsurveillance mechanism to detect signs of an emerging problem or early \nwarning  systems;  and  (2) maintaining  regional  and  domestic  financial \nstability by addressing short-term liquidity difficulties in the region and \nsupplementing the existing international financial arrangements.  \n(b)  Second, formation of a working group to review the various proposed \nregional  arrangements  and  mechanisms,  and  the  feasibility  of  their \nimplementation.  \n \n(iii)  Component 3. Conduct a 2-day workshop to discuss the findings and proposals \nformulated under the coordination mechanism. Resource persons and economic \nexperts  will  be  invited  to  provide  inputs  in  addressing  the  problems  and \n ", "  5\nchallenges leading to implementation of the proposed arrangements. A working \ngroup report will be prepared outlining the proposed initiatives. \n \n(iv)  Component 4. Hold meetings involving high-level policymakers and regulators to \ndiscuss  the  possibility  of  national  and  possibly  regional  programs  and \narrangements, including any special programs to be put in place by multilateral \ninstitutions, including the ADB. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA\u2019s total cost is estimated at $800,000 equivalent. It will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The cost estimates and proposed financing plan are in \nAppendix 2.  No activity will be financed in any member country under this TA, unless and until \na letter of no objection in respect of such activity has been received from the government of \nsuch member country. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The South Asia Regional Department, \nalong with the Central West Regional Department and the Office of Regional Cooperation and \nIntegration, will implement the TA. A joint implementation group comprising these departments \nwill  be  formed.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  within  nine  months  from  the  date  of  its \neffectiveness,  from  December  2008  to  August  2009.    Given  the  tight  time  frame  for \nimplementing the TA, ADB will recruit international consultants through a single-source selection \nof a firm and will engage the services of reputed international economists and resource persons \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time \nto time). The terms of reference for consultants and resource persons are in Appendix 3. \nDisbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook.5 \n \n15.  The TA is expected to commence in January 2009 with the engagement of consultants \nto prepare three background papers and context issues on the global financial crisis and the \nvulnerabilities in the financial system and real economies of South Asian DMCs. The consulting \nfirm will also be responsible for planning and organizing logistics, administration, and delivery \narrangements to execute the TA, which will include but not be limited to (i) preparing the \nbackground papers; (ii) organizing advisory group meetings for selecting topics and agenda; (iii) \nacting as secretariat for the coordinating mechanisms set up during component 1 and preparing \nbackground papers for subsequent meetings under components 2, 3, and 4 in consultation with \nthe individual international economists and resource persons; (iv) publishing and disseminating \ninformation, papers, and reports on the conferences and workshop and facilitating the network \nof key delegates and participants; and (v) moderating the  conferences and/or forums.  \n \nIV.
