THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Second Greater Mekong Subregion Corridor Towns \nDevelopment Project.1 \n \n2.  The project will support the Government of Viet Nam in enhancing the competitiveness \nof Bac Giang, Mong Cai, and Sa Pa towns, located along the North\u2013South Economic Corridor, \none  of  the  three  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS)  economic  corridors.2 The  project  will \nimprove  urban  services  in  the  three  towns  through  improved  wastewater  management, \nupgrading of urban roads and drainage, riverbank protection, and enhancement of urban public \nspace. The  project  will  enhance  climate  resilience  and  support  economic  competitiveness, \nequity  and  the  environment,  as  outlined  in  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Urban \nOperational Plan.3 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  The six GMS countries are geographically contiguous and form an important cluster of \neconomic activity.4 Although their respective level of economic development varies widely, the \nurban development trajectories of the GMS countries are increasingly similar. Key drivers of \nurban development and regional integration include the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \nEconomic Community (anticipated in 2015), increased domestic and international migration \nwithin  the  region,  the  economic  rise  of  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC),  significant \nimprovements in road transformation and connectivity, the spread of and improvements in cell \nphone and internet coverage, and the great potential and growing demand for tourism and \nrelated activities. The three economic corridors defined under the GMS framework form a \nnetwork of important routes that connect some of the largest cities in the GMS, including Ha Noi, \nHo Chi Minh City, Bangkok, Phnom Penh, Kunming, and Nanning.5 \n \n4.  This project in Viet Nam, together with the projects in Cambodia and Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic, represent the second phase of the GMS Corridor Towns Development \nProject in these countries, which supported urban development along the East\u2013West Economic \nCorridor and the Southern Economic Corridor.6 The focus on developing towns along economic \ncorridors aims to maximize the benefits of increased trade and traffic flows, so as to strengthen \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance for the Second Greater Mekong Subregion Corridor Towns \nDevelopment Project (TA 8425-REG). \n3  ADB. 2012. Urban Operational Plan, 2012\u20122020. Manila. \n4  The GMS countries are Cambodia, the People's Republic of China (specifically Yunnan Province and Guangxi \nZhuang Autonomous Region), Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam. \n5  The three economic corridors are the North\u2013South Economic Corridor, the East\u2013West Economic Corridor, and the \nSouthern Economic Corridor.

Manila (Loan 2969-VIE). ", "2 \ntheir competitiveness and catalyze wider economic growth in the region. The development of \nenvironmental infrastructure will promote green growth and climate resilience in these towns. \nThe project supports the first four strategic thrusts of the GMS Strategic Framework, 2012\u2012\n2022: (i) strengthening infrastructure linkages; (ii) facilitating cross-border trade, investment, and \ntourism; (iii) enhancing private sector participation and competitiveness; and (iv) developing \nhuman resources.7  \n \n5.  The strategic location of the corridor towns provides the stimulus for increased trade and \ninvestment.  Access  to  markets  will  provide  many  incentives  for  local  economies  in  the \nhinterlands of the corridor towns. Given these development opportunities, and the rapid urban \npopulation growth and expansion in these areas, several corridor towns now face growing \ndemands for urban infrastructure and essential support services, including Bac Giang, Mong Cai, \nand Sa Pa in Viet Nam along the North\u2013South Economic Corridor. \n \n6.  Bac Giang is the administrative capital of Bac Giang Province, and located 50 kilometers \n(km) northeast of Ha Noi and 45 km from the Noi Bai International airport. In 2013 the city had a \npopulation of about 150,000, about half of which (72,000) was urban. Characteristics of the city \nthat favor development and investment include its strategic location on key transport corridors \nthat link population centers and ports and provide access to larger markets, principally in the \nPRC and within the Ha Noi capital region.  \n \n7.  Mong Cai is a border town located in Qu\u1ea3ng Ninh Province in northeastern Viet Nam; it \nis located opposite Dongxing town, in Guangxi Province of the PRC. The population of Mong \nCai was about 95,000 people in 2013, of which some 56,000 were urban. The economy is \ntypical of many border towns, with trade and services accounting for 71% of the town\u2019s gross \ndomestic product in 2013. The economy and population are both expanding rapidly (population \nis expected to exceed 150,000 by 2020). Strategic economic investment is ongoing, including \nimprovement  of  cross-border  facilities  with  the  PRC,  and  construction  of  an  expressway \nconnection to Hai Phong and Ha Noi. The potential designation of a Mong Cai Economic Zone \nwill increase the town\u2019s economic competitiveness. Despite the vibrant economy, investment in \nessential environmental infrastructure and services is insufficient. \n \n8.  Sa Pa is a small town located about 35 km from Lao Cai City in Lao Cai Province in \nnorthwestern Viet Nam. The town\u2019s population numbered about 54,000 in 2013, with an urban \npopulation  of  almost  15,000.  Sa  Pa  is  an  international  tourist  destination  and  highland \nagricultural area, where strategic corridor investments in transport infrastructure are placing \nincreasing  development  pressures  on  the  high-quality  mountain  landscapes  and  cultural \ndiversity  of  the  predominantly  ethnic  minority  population.  Tourism  has  increased  rapidly \nfollowing the opening of the Ha Noi\u2013Lao Cai expressway in 2014, providing both the opportunity \nand challenge to urgently address deficiencies in basic urban infrastructure and green city \nplanning to secure a sustainable future for the town. \n \n9.  Lessons.  Key  lessons  from  completed  or  ongoing  ADB-financed  projects  in  urban \ndevelopment, including the first phase of the GMS Corridor Towns Development Project in Viet \nNam, are: (i) civic participation and demand-driven development activities enhance the sense of \nlocal ownership; (ii) capacity building is a long-term effort requiring proper planning, adequate \ntargeting, and up-front implementation; (iii) institutional and policy reform should be based on \nrealistic assessments of timing, resource requirements, and political will; (iv) financial cost \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2011.

Transport and trade connections with nearby cities and \nregions are also critical for overall project success. The project is responsive to these lessons; it \nhas a strong capacity development component, optimizes the value of community involvement, \nadopts a business-like approach to revenue collection and operation and maintenance (O&M), \nand includes studies to explore issues (e.g., relating to connectivity). Executing agencies will \nalso receive start-up support on ADB procedures upon project commencement.  \n \n10.  Related  policies  and  strategies.  The  project  is  aligned  with  government  policies, \nincluding (i) the Socio-economic Development Strategy, 2011\u20132020 and the associated Socio-\neconomic Development Plan; and (ii) other relevant national policies and strategies, including \nthe Green Growth Strategy and Draft Action Plan, the Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan, \nand  the  National  Program  on  Urban  Development  in  2011\u20132020. 8The  Socio-economic \nDevelopment Plan is the main element of Viet Nam\u2019s strategic plan with a focus on (i) linking \nurban and rural centers, (ii) improving urban planning and management, (iii) developing small \nand  medium-sized  towns  and  cities,  and  (iv)  developing  economic  corridors  by  building \neconomic  nodes.  Prosperous  urban  centers  located  in  economic  corridors  are  central  to \neconomic progress; this project can contribute through provision of essential environmental \ninfrastructure and urban investments. \n \n11.  The project is in line with the ADB country partnership strategy for Viet Nam; ADB\u2019s \nUrban Operational Plan; the GrEEEn Cities Approach, which has been piloted in several cities \nin Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam; ADB\u2019s Water Operational Plan; the \nGMS Strategic Framework; and the GMS Regional Investment Framework Implementation Plan, \n2014\u20132018.9 The  towns  under  this  project  were  selected  and  prioritized  under  the  GMS \nRegional  Investment  Framework.  As  part  of  project  preparation,  strategic  local  economic \ndevelopment  plans  (SLEDPs)\u2014which  present  the  medium-term  strategy,  planning,  and \ninvestment plan for each town\u2014have been prepared. The SLEDPs are based on technical \nassessments of potential investments in economic development, the environment, equity, and \ngood governance, as well as extensive stakeholder consultations and discussions. The SLEDPs \nare intended to enhance existing provincial development and master plans and anchor these to \nthe regional GMS context, and will be refined and endorsed during project implementation. \n \n                                                \n8  Government of Viet Nam, Ministry of Planning and Investment. 2011.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n23.  The subprojects were selected for the provision of basic environmental services. This \nwill be achieved through improved wastewater management (all three towns), urban roads \nupgrading (Bac Giang and Sa Pa), drainage upgrading (all three towns), riverbank protection \n(Mong Cai), and town center enhancement (Sa Pa). The choices reflect the priorities accorded \nby the government and were selected through the application of criteria to support economic \ncompetitiveness,  equity,  and  the  environment  (para.  2).  They  are  technically  feasible  and \nemploy civil works and O&M technology that can be managed by provincial and municipal \nauthorities. Climate-resilient design has been ensured, including, for example, using elevated \nfacility foundations, use of berms and bunds, and sufficient drainage for wastewater treatment \nplants (Bac Giang and Mong Cai); an increase in the pumping capacity for stormwater pumps \n(Bac Giang); grading, surfacing; and increasing lateral drainage of roads to handle flood levels \n(Bac  Giang  and  Sa  Pa);  and  increasing  the  height  of  riverbank  protection  (Mong  Cai). \nAppropriate capacity building and training are included in the project design.   \n \n24.  The project recognizes the weak institutional capacity of the provincial and municipal \nauthorities to plan and manage urban infrastructure, and deliver essential urban services. This \nwill be addressed through targeted training and institutional capacity building.   \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n25.  An  economic  analysis  was  undertaken  to  determine  the  viability  of  the  subproject \ncomponents, using the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) as the indicator. The base case \nresults indicate that all components are economically viable with an estimated EIRR exceeding \nthe assumed economic opportunity cost of capital of 12%. The computed EIRR is 15%\u201321% for \nBac Giang, 14%\u201319% for Mong Cai, and 15% for Sa Pa. All subprojects were generally viable \nunder  adverse  scenarios,  including  a  10%  increase  in  capital  or  O&M  costs,  and  a  10% \nreduction or 1-year delay in benefits.10  \n \n26.  A financial analysis was conducted for each city\u2019s revenue and nonrevenue-generating \nsubprojects  to  confirm  the  sustainability  of  the  investment.11 It  established  that  sufficient \ncounterpart funds for the investment components will be available for all towns. None of the \npublic entities involved in the operation of the respective project components (e.g., sanitation or \nroad maintenance) is corporatized. All are government sector units, and none have separate \naccounts. Therefore a financial internal rate of return has not been calculated. The tariffs \ncollected for the revenue generating components (e.g., wastewater) currently do not fully cover \nO&M costs, but will be adjusted over time to meet these requirements. Additional funding (if \nneeded  to  meet  full  O&M  costs)  will  be  allocated  and  made  available  by  the  provincial \ngovernments, a commitment that has been covenanted in the loan agreement. \n \nC.  Governance \n27.  The three  executing  agencies  have  implemented  international  development  partner-\nfinanced  projects,  but  all  will  receive  start-up  support  on  ADB  procedures.  Capacity \ndevelopment  and  training  will  be  provided  to  the  PMUs  on  financial  and  procurement \n                                                \n10  Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n11  Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) \n ", "8 \nmanagement and fund disbursement. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) \nwas explained to and discussed with the government of Viet Nam and the Bac Giang PPC, \nQuang Ninh PPC, and Lao Cai PPC.  The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual.12 \n \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n28.  Based  on  the  poverty  and  social  analysis,  the  project  is  classified  as  general \nintervention.13 The overall project social impacts are expected to be positive, with expected \nimprovements to the quality of life of people in the three towns. The project will result in \nimproved climate-resilient infrastructure in each town that benefits all inhabitants, including the \nurban poor and other vulnerable groups. The affordability of sanitation services will not be a \nconcern because house connections are included in the project cost and will be provided at no \ncharge. Proposed wastewater tariffs have been assessed as affordable for low-income groups. \nRiverbank protection in Mong Cai will improve flood protection for the project-affected people, \ntheir homes, and their property. Poor and vulnerable households located in low-lying, flood-\nprone areas and who lack basic environmental sanitation will benefit the most. \n \n29.  The projects are categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. The gender analysis \nconcluded that women in the subproject areas are at potential risk of not realizing the full \npotential of project benefits and opportunities if gender issues concerning women\u2019s employment \nopportunities and sector representation in decision making are not mainstreamed in project \nactivities. Accordingly, a gender action plan has been prepared that aims to (i) ensure gender \nissues are mainstreamed in project planning and implementation, (ii) address specific impacts \nand risks that may affect women differently or disproportionally compared to men, and (iii) \nenhance women\u2018s participation in project benefits.  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n30.  Social safeguards. The project is classified as safeguard category B for involuntary \nresettlement. Two resettlement plans, one for Bac Giang and one for Mong Cai, have been \nprepared for components that will trigger land acquisition and resettlement impacts. A combined \nresettlement  and  indigenous  peoples  plan  (Resettlement  and  Ethnic  Minority  Development \nPlan) has been prepared for Sa Pa\u2014indigenous peoples safeguards are triggered (category B), \nbut limited to land acquisition and resettlement.14  \n \n31.  A total of 16.46 hectare of land will be acquired, affecting 659 households or about 2,788 \naffected persons. Three households (15 persons) will require physical relocation, 21 households \nwill experience loss of more than 10% of income-generating assets, 1 household will lose all its \nproduction land, and 28 will have their remaining agricultural areas rendered too small for \ncontinued  cultivation.  Other  impacts  include  partial  loss  of  land  and  of  graves.  The  land \nacquisition and resettlement cost ($2.54 million) will be provided through counterpart financing.   \nAll affected households are entitled to compensation and rehabilitation assistance. Income \nrestoration  (cash  assistance  and  skills  training)  will  be  provided  to  severely  affected  and \nvulnerable households.  \n                                                \n12 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n13 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy and Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n14 Resettlement Plan: Bac Giang; Resettlement Plan: Mong Cai; and Resettlement and Ethnic Minority Development \nPlan: Sa Pa  (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \n32.  Indigenous peoples. For the Sa Pa subproject, indigenous peoples safeguards are \ntriggered but limited to land acquisition; a resettlement and ethnic minority development plan \nhas been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the ADB Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009). The indigenous peoples safeguard category is B. \n \n33.  Environment safeguards. The project is classified as category B for the environment in \naccordance with the ADB Safeguard Policy Statement. One initial environmental examination \n(IEE)  and  three  environmental  management  plans  (EMPs)  (one  per  town)  have  been \nprepared. 15  The  proposed  subprojects  are  not  expected  to  cause  irreversible  adverse \nenvironment  impacts.  Mitigation  measures  for  identified  impacts  related  to  siting,  design, \nconstruction, and operation have been incorporated in the EMPs. In addition, it is recommended \nthat the potential impacts of climate change and natural hazards (e.g., flooding and earthquakes) \non the project be integrated into the design and engineering stage as part of the IEE assessment \nwhenever feasible, practical, and appropriate. At the detailed design stage, the IEE and EMPs will \nbe updated and finalized. \n \n34.  The final EMPs will form part of the contract bidding documents and be incorporated in \nthe works contracts. Environmental considerations during design, and allocation of sufficient \nfunding  for  O&M  will  help  mitigate  potential  adverse  impacts  during  operation.  Effective \nenvironmental  monitoring  during  implementation  will  be  ensured  by  including  budget  and \ninstitutional arrangements for EMP implementation and monitoring. EMP implementation will be \nensured  by  a  designated  environment  officer  in  the  project  coordination  unit,  whose \nresponsibilities are detailed in the EMPs.   \n \n35.  Climate change projections and climate change impacts on the project are discussed in \nthe climate vulnerability and risk assessment section of the IEE. The cost of climate change \nadaptation is estimated to be $3.15 million, or about 3% of the ADB loan. Public consultations \nwere conducted through formal and informal group discussions in October 2014 and January\u2013\nFebruary 2015 and will be ongoing during implementation. Grievance redress mechanisms have \nbeen established in synergy with social safeguards. In compliance with ADB requirements, the \nsafeguard documents have been posted on ADB\u2019s website. \n \n36.  Resettlement and environment documents have been prepared in consultation with local \ncommunities and are in accordance with the ADB SPS and Viet Nam\u2019s laws and regulations. \nThe documents have been endorsed, approved, and posted on the ADB website.A grievance \n \nredress mechanism will help to facilitate resolution of complaints regarding project performance. \nThe resettlement plans, IEE, and EMPs will be updated and disclosed after detailed design and \ncleared by ADB prior to contract awards. The project towns have demonstrated a high level of \ncommitment to environmental and social safeguards, and have allocated their own resources for \nland  acquisition  and  resettlement.  Implementation  arrangements  include  designated \nresponsibilities for safeguards monitoring. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n37.  The integrated benefits and impacts from the project are expected to outweigh the costs. \nThe overall risk is assessed as medium. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in \nTable 4 and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.16  \n \n                                                \n15 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nLack of capacity for project management  Support and training provided by the PISC. \nPotential irregularities in procurement and  Support and training provided by project implementation and capacity \nfinancial management  development consultants.
