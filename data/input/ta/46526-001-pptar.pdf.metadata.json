The project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) is required to prepare the Punjab \nIntermediate Cities Improvement Investment Program (the investment program) and feasibility \nstudy for Tranche 1 for possible funding by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to support urban \ndevelopment and municipal services in the selected intermediate cities in Punjab province of \nPakistan.1 There is a need for specific expertise from the competent international consulting firm \nto prepare the investment program considering its institutional, financial and technical complexity. \nThe PPTA will also assist the Government of Punjab (GoPb) to proceed with pre-implementation \nactivities such as advance procurement. The PPTA will be implemented over 16 months from \nNovember 2014 to February 2016.  \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n2.  The proposed investment program will be prepared based on the works undertaken under \nthe technical assistance (TA) 7321-PAK: Punjab Cities Improvement Investment Program.2 The \nGoPb indicated that one or two of the intermediate cities maybe selected (indicatively Sialkot \nand/or Sargodha) for a proposed initial investment support, to use as a pilot city demonstrating \nthe positive impact from implementing an integrated package of planned urban reforms, improved \nservice delivery and sustainable investments. Therefore, the core components of the feasibility \nstudy  assessments  and  undertaken  studies  that  are  mostly  focused  on  Sialkot  city  remain \nrelevant. However, this work will be reassessed, and will incorporate recent floods, changing \nclimate patterns, and investments made in the last few years.  Similarly, the investment plan for \nthe other candidate cities need to be reviewed, considering the recent works and plans developed \nfor these cities, through World Bank and other development partners financed projects and the \nGoPb annual development funding. The cities will be selected based on the selection criteria \nprepared under the PPTA that will include performance parameters.   \n3.  The PPTA will have the following main activities: (i) review and update macroeconomic \nand urban sector context assessment including policy reform framework, sector road map, and \ninvestment  plan;  (ii)  review  and  update  urban  services  and  public  utilities  assessment;  (iii) \nundertake  due  diligence;  (iv)    formulate  the  investment  program  with  detailed  physical  and \nnonphysical  investments for  the  selected  subsectors  and  cities,  activities  supporting ongoing \nurban institutional and organizational development, and midterm investment plan for all tranches; (v) \nprepare detailed feasibility study for Tranche 1; and (vi) undertake advance actions with detailed \nprocurement plan and sample bidding documents. These activities will be supported by required \nsurveys and studies.  \n4.  The major outputs and activities are summarized in Table A4.1.  \nTable A4.1: Summary of Major Outputs and Activities \nMajor Activities  Major Outputs  Expected  \nCompletion Date \nMacroeconomic and Urban  Macroeconomic and Sector Assessment Report;   August 2015 \nSector Assessment   Policy Reform Framework; Sector Road Map and \nInvestment Plan \nUrban Services and Public  Business Plan Framework for Sustainable Utilities;  August 2015 \nUtilities Assessment   Capacity Development Report; and PPP report  \nDue Diligence  Economic Analysis Report; Financial Analysis Report;  August 2015 \nFund Flow Analysis Report; Financial Management   \n                                                \n1  The selection criteria for the proposed investment program will be applied to identify priority sub-sectors and cities to be \nfinanced under the investment program. \n2  ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance 7321-PAK: Punjab Cities Improvement Investment Program in \n2009-2012.   \n ", "14  Appendix 4 \nMajor Activities  Major Outputs  Expected  \nCompletion Date \nAssessment Report; Financial Sustainability Plan; Key \nStakeholders Capacity Assessment Report; \nEnvironmental Assessment and Review Framework and \nInitial Environmental Examination (Tranche 1); Summary \nPoverty Reduction and Social Strategy Report Poverty \nAnalysis and Social Development Plan; Gender Analysis \nand Action Plan; Land Acquisition and Resettlement \nFramework and Land Acquisition and Resettlement Plan \n(Tranche1); Indigenous Peoples Plan (Tranche1); Risk \nAssessment and Risk Mitigation Plan; Procurement \nCapacity Assessment Report; Development Coordination \nReport; Climate Risk, Vulnerability and Adaptation \nAssessment Report \nFormulate Investment  Investment Program Report with detailed physical and  September \nProgram  nonphysical investment plan;  FFA; DMF; and FAM  2015 \nFeasibility Study for  Engineering Design with Alternative Analysis Report;  October 2015 \nTranche 1   Least Cost Analysis and Demand Forecast Report; \nProject Costs and Benefits Report; Project Sustainability \nAssessment Report Sensitivity and Risk Analyses; PFR \nfor Tranche 1 \nAdvance Action   Contracts on program management consulting services;  March 2016 \ndetailed design and equipment contracts are ready to \naward   \nDMF = design and monitoring framework; FFA = framework financing agreement; FAM = facility administration manual; PFR = \nperiodic financing request; PPP= public-private partnership. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \nC.   Cost Estimate and Proposed Financing Arrangement  \n5.  The TA is estimated to cost $900,000 equivalent, of which $800,000 will be financed on a \ngrant basis by ADB's Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff inputs, data and information provision, office \nspace, furniture, equipment and communication facilities and other in-kind contribution. External \nfinancing is not pursued because of the urgent need for consulting  services to prepare the \ninvestment program.
