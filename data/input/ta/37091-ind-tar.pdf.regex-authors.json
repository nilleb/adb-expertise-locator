INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has included in its country operation business plan \n(COBP) 2008-2010 for India1 a loan for agribusiness infrastructure development for Bihar and \nMaharashtra  as  a  component  of  ADB\u2019s  2008  lending  program  and  subsequently  as  2009 \nlending program2. To support the preparation of the project, a project preparatory technical \nassistance (TA) was implemented from July 2007 to May 20083.  In July 2008, during the loan \nfact finding mission, it became evident that, while broad concepts and approaches of the Project \nwere developed by the completed PPTA, there was a need to operationalize them and to firm \nup the proposed Project, by preparing detailed project reports for specific sub-projects and by \nengaging with the potential private sector investors to ensure a smooth implementation of the \nproject. To respond to this need, additional TA would be necessary. A concept paper was \nprepared and endorsed for ADB funding. During the loan fact finding mission, the impact, \noutcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of \nreference of the TA were finalized4. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  While the contribution of agriculture in the GDP of India has declined from 56% in 1950 to \n17% in the year 2007, there has not been any significant shift in the occupational structure and \ntherefore around 58% of the work force continues to depend on agriculture for its livelihood. \nTherefore agriculture\u2019s importance in terms of the economic health, and the socio-political fabric \nof the country remains well beyond its contribution to the national output. Performance of the \nrural non-farm sector, now larger than the agricultural sector, is also strongly correlated with the \nperformance  of  agriculture.  About  61%  of  agriculture  produce  is  transacted  in  markets \ncharacterized by long marketing chains, regulated markets and inefficient commercial retail \nchain  systems  (i.e.  traditional  value  chains).  Furthermore,  farmer  access  to  markets  is \nhampered by poor roads, rudimentary market infrastructure, and excessive regulation. Agro-\nprocessing industry contributes less than 5% of GDP. The horticulture sector contributes around \n28% of the agricultural GDP from about 13% of the area under cultivation and provides 37% of \nthe total exports of agricultural commodities, offering a wide range of choices to the farmers for \ncrop  diversification.  While  food  products  account  for  almost  53%  of  private  consumption \nexpenditure and their demand rises consistently at almost 8% per annum, the consumer basket \nis continuously undergoing change in favor of perishables, such as fresh fruits and vegetables, \nand processed healthy products. The present marketing and processing systems, characterized \nby long and fragmented supply chains, high wastages, and low share of producers in price \nrealizations, are inadequately equipped to meet the growing needs of consumers for quantity, \nquality and safety.   \n \n3.  The most important constraints in establishing the required value chain linkages are in the \narea of agricultural marketing and processing. Farmers fail to link (i) among themselves through \neffective producer organizations for joint decisions in investment, production and marketing, (ii) \nwith enterprises, (iii) to markets because of the limited access to relevant market information \nand intelligence, and inadequate market and support infrastructure, such as roads, and (iv) to \nresearch and extension providers to address their specific technology and knowledge needs. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2007. India: Country Operational Business Plan, 2008-2010. Manila. \n2  During the 2008 India Country Programming Mission with the BTOR of the Mission approved by the Vice President \non 21 July 2008. \n3  Component Technical Assistance No. 9 under TA 4814-IND: Project Processing and Capacity Development (TA \ncluster). \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 4 November 2008.  \n ", "2   \nEnterprises have weak linkages with (i) farmers since contract farming and vertical integration \narrangements  are  almost  non  existent,  (ii)  consumers  because  of  the  virtual  absence  of \norganized retail chains, (iii) service providers (research, extension, finance) because of lack of \nconfidence,  and (iv) international markets because of the absence of proper certification, quality \nassurance  systems  and  inadequate  marketing  and  support  infrastructure.  The  capacity  of \nindividuals,  groups,  and  service  providers  to  understand  and  practice  modern  value  chain \nprinciples and management remains low and as a result agribusiness development, in spite of \nthe country\u2019s enormous potential, has been lackadaisical. \n \n4.  Greater  crop  diversification  and  value  addition  in  agriculture  has  the  potential  to \nsignificantly reduce poverty and improve the quality of life through substantial employment \nopportunities in rural India (see Appendix 2). Agribusiness development through its linkages to \ncrop production, industry, and services has the potential to reverse the declining growth trend in \nagriculture with broad multiplier effects elsewhere in the economy. At the farm level, market-\ndriven agribusiness growth will contribute to the production of high-value crops, which are more \nremunerative and labor intensive than staple crops, and thus could generate significant income \nand  employment  growth  for  the  rural  poor.  Increased  agro-processing  and  value  addition, \nparticularly if it is undertaken within or near producing areas, would also significantly increase \noff-farm  employment  opportunities.  The  growing  demand  for  higher  quality  produce  and \nprocessed foods as incomes rise, urbanization increases, and modern retail chains develop \nsuggest that investments in developing organized modern supply chains will also have high \nfinancial returns. In addition, India has a comparative advantage in a number of agricultural \ncommodities that could be exploited to penetrate export markets if quality assurance of produce \nand competitive value chains can be developed. However, to develop modern value chains for \nhigh value agriculture, large investments are required in modern methods of sorting, grading, \npost-harvest management and development of cold chains. Such investment in turn requires \nthat new players, including private sector players, are able to enter existing markets and set up \nnew marketing channels. Thus, in order to harness the potential of the emerging consumer \ndemand,  a  professionally  managed  competitive  alternate  marketing  structure  that  provides \nmultiple choices to farmers for sale of produce along with a comprehensive solution to meet the \nneeds of the stakeholders is necessary.  Such a system entails also efficient management skills, \nwhich can only be infused by inviting private sector participation in the sector. \n \n5.  Encouraging market-driven agribusiness and the formation of modern agricultural value \nchains has been a strategic priority in Government development plans for quite some time. \nIndeed  the  agriculture  sector  is  the  core  of  the  11th  Five-Year  Plan  (2008-2012),  where \ndiversification and augmenting and modernizing rural infrastructure (including cold chains and \nmarketing  outlets,  as  well  as  basic  transportation  and  communications  infrastructure)  are \nconsidered  as  major  elements  in  the  strategy  for  accelerating  agricultural  growth  and \ndevelopment  of  rural  areas.  To  support  the  shift  from  staple  to  high-value  crops,  the \nGovernment  is willing to introduce supportive policy framework and infrastructure network, \nincluding a much greater focus on supply chain arrangements, improved physical connectivity \nbetween producing areas and markets, and a legal framework and stronger incentives for \nprivate participation in agricultural marketing. The Government in 2005 launched the broad-\nbased National Horticulture Mission (NHM) under the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) to promote \nagricultural  diversification  and  increase  value  addition  on  a  national  scale.  Subsequent \nagribusiness  development  initiatives  include  programs  rolled  out  in  2007  to  modernize \nagricultural  terminal  markets  and  to  establish  \u2018mega  food  parks\u2019  through  public-private \npartnerships (PPPs) to enhance incentives for private sector participation and establish stronger \nlinkages with production areas.  \n \n ", "  3\n6.  Against this background, the Agribusiness Infrastructure Development Project for Bihar \nand  Maharashtra  is  in  the  ADB\u2019s  2009  lending  program  for  India  under  the  modality  of \nMultitranche Financing Facility (MFF)5.  The first TA has prepared a Project to improve physical \nand institutional linkages between various stakeholders along the agricultural value chain mainly \nthrough  the  implementation  of  the  following  4,  distinct  but  complimentary  and  linked \ncomponents:  (i)  Agribusiness  Market  Infrastructure;  (ii)  Support  Infrastructure;  (iii)  Market \nIntelligence; and (iv) Capacity Building and Value Chain Linkages.  More specifically, the Project \nwill address the integration of the value chain and key constraints to agribusiness development \nby establishing  (i) on-farm centers (OFC) in production areas to provide basic infrastructure \nincluding  mechanical  harvesting  and  post  harvest  treatment  equipment,  storage,  grading, \nsorting,  packaging,  and  primary  processing;  (ii)  agribusiness  centers  (ABC);  providing \ncompetitive trading facilities; marketing intelligence; storage including pre-cooling and cold store \nfacilities; sorting, grading and agro-processing facilities; and (iii) perishable cargo centers (PCC) \nat airports and railways, promoting \u201cend to end\u201d value chain linkage and providing cold chain \nfacilities  linked  to  the  value  chain.  The  Project  envisages  that  every  proposed  marketing \ninfrastructure is to be linked to the provision of basic infrastructure, such as roads, power and \nwater supply, to improve physical connectivity through-out the value chain. The Project also \nproposes  (i)  market  intelligence  activities,  aimed  at  improving  stakeholder  knowledge  and \nawareness of factors affecting price determination and price information at different markets; \nand (ii) promotion of value chain linkages, through producers\u2019 group formation and contract \nfarming, aimed at fostering partnerships and forward and backward linkages between different \nstakeholders along the chain. See Appendix 3 for the Project\u2019s graphic representation. Overall, \nthe project will adopt a demand-driven approach, aimed at the private sector-led development of \nend-to-end integrated chains which will link production areas to export and domestic retail \nmarkets. The project was designed incorporating lessons learned from the implementation of \nother agribusiness development programs in the region. \n \n7.  The first TA (footnote 3) has prepared the abovementioned proposal with its concepts \nand approaches, including Project components and activities. During the initial phase of project \nprocessing, there was consensus among Government of India and ADB on the framework of the \nProject design as it contains concepts that are good and appropriate in terms of what is required \nfor  the  sector  and  they  are  in  tune  with  what  the  government  is  planning.  The  proposed \napproach, components and activities, were agreeable with the Government of India, the state \nGovernments of Bihar and Maharashtra6 and MOA. However, to reduce the time gap between \nproject approval and implementation7, the need to operationalize the project concepts and to \nfirm up the proposed Project, by preparing detailed project reports (DPRs)8 for the end-to-end \nvalue chains, became apparent. To address this need, the proposed TA will prepare the DPRs \nfor 2 end-to-end value chains per state, with one value chain including approximately up to 50 \nOFCs, up to 3 ABCs, and up to 2 PCCs (one at airport and one at railway, as appropriate). The \n4 value chains developed in the DPRs would constitute the investments to be funded under the \nfirst tranche of the MFF, once the loan is approved. Preparation of investments in respect of the \nsecond and subsequent tranches will be completed under the first and subsequent tranches. \n \n                                                 \n5  The loan modality however will be finalized during PPTA. \n6  The State of Bihar has adopted the same approach and concepts in the State Road Map for the Agriculture Sector \nand Allied Sectors. The State of Maharashtra has expressly requested ADB to help the agribusiness sector through \nthe development of a few end-to-end value chains in the ground as a show case to the sector stakeholders of the \nbenefits of efficient modern agricultural value chains. \n7  This is a serious problem encountered by many ADB-assisted infrastructure projects in India. \n8  Detailed project report is a complete document for investment decision-making, approval, planning, implementing \nwhereas feasibility study report is a base document for investment decision-making.  \n ", "4   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The overall impact of the TA (and the Project) will be increased private sector investment \nin and enhanced integration of small farmers, including female farmers, into agricultural value \nchains  for  high  value  crops  in  Bihar  and  Maharashtra.  This  will  be  achieved  through  the \ndevelopment of 4 end-to-end modern value chains that will demonstrate that (i) private sector \nmanagement results in higher price realization for the farmer and profit for the private investor, \nin addition to improved governance; and (ii) private sector investment in organized value chains \ncan result into high financial returns. The TA\u2019s outcome will include (i) 4 DPRs for 2 end-to-end \nvalue chains per state; (ii) a detailed project design that the Government of India and ADB will \nhave agreed upon to be financed by the first tranche of the MFF under AIDP; and (iii) list of \npotential private sector investors that will be mobilized as soon as the loan is approved.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA will be implemented in three phases. The first phase (2 months) will involve a \ndetailed assessment of the market demand and supply for different agricultural value chains to \nidentify specific location and product-specific infrastructure and facilities gaps for 4 value chains, \n2 per state. The assessment will include (i) design, engineering, and preparation of master \nplans of the various structures planned as components of each value chain; (ii) ways of linking \nvarious components of each value chain; (iii) social, legal and institutional aspects of the various \nproject components; (iv) detailed project costs for each value chain, along with proposed means \nof finance, and assessment of bankability of projects, along with risk mitigation mechanism; and \n(v) preparation of safeguards documents as per ADB's requirements (environment, indigenous \npeople, involuntary resettlement). Close attention will be paid to identifying market failures that \nneed to be addressed through public investment, private sector participation, and public-private \npartnerships. Based on the first phase, the second phase (2 months) will involve formulation of \nthe 4 DPRs for end-to-end agricultural value chains, including (i) detailed design and costing of \nlogistics  for  each  value  chain;  (ii)  project  structuring  for  determining  various  PPP  options, \nincluding ownership structure, project construction, O&M etc.; and (iii) assessment on social and \npolitical acceptability of project structures by pre-testing it with communities of farmers, traders \nand other sector stakeholders. The third phase (2 months) will finalize the bid and contract \ndocuments for the various infrastructures along the identified value chains and the pool of \npotential private players/investors to elicit responsive bids. The project will not be limited to \nspecific crops among the high value crops, though the TA will identify the crops with highest \ndomestic market demand and export potential. The creation of high-value production clusters by \nregion will be considered to facilitate marketing and processing of value-added products. The \nTA  will  also  identify  areas  where  the  capacity  of  the  public  and  private  sector  needs \nstrengthening to support services for agribusiness development. Stakeholder workshops will be \nconducted in each state to disseminate and validate the detailed design. A final tripartite review \nmeeting will confirm the Project design at the end of phase 2 and a detailed final report will be \npresented within 0.5 months incorporating the feedback received. \n \n10.   For the project to establish effective agribusiness systems by the private sector, with \nsupport from the Government, a new way of thinking and strategies for overcoming significant \ncoordination  failures  are  needed.  This  will  require  the  creation  of  appropriate  institutional \nmechanisms.  The  project  will  be  designed  to  provide  maximum  benefit  to  small-scale \nagribusinesses. However, this will be possible only by improving the performance of the entire \n ", "  5\nvalue chain. The methodology of the TA will be to link with the government initiatives of terminal \nmarket and mega food park sites in order to identify infrastructure gaps at lower levels in the \nvalue chain. In this way, ADB\u2019s assistance would therefore complement and have maximum \nsynergy with the Government\u2019s sector development initiatives.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $1,250,000  equivalent.  ADB  will  finance \n$1,000,000 on a grant basis under ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government will finance the \nremaining cost of $250,000 equivalent primarily in kind, including office space, counterpart staff, \nlocal transport, and other minor administrative expenses. The TA cost estimates and financing \nplan are presented in Appendix 4. The Government has been informed that approval of the TA \ndoes not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.  The Executing Agencies (EA) for the TA will be the relevant agriculture development \nagencies of Bihar and Maharashtra, i.e. the Department of Agriculture and the Department of \nCo-operation & Agricultural Marketing respectively. The EAs will (i) identify suitable counterpart \nstaff to liaise with the team of consultants during the TA implementation period, and (ii) provide \na suitable office space to the consultants in Patna and Maharashtra.  \n \n13.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 6 months commencing in January 2009 and \nwill conclude no later than June 2009. Consultants\u2019 inputs will amount to 31 person-months (pm), \n29 national and 2 international, for 2 dedicated teams for each state, consisting mainly of the \nfollowing  specialists:  agricultural  supply  chain  (6  pm,  national),  Infrastructure  specialists \n(agricultural, logistics and industrial infrastructure, 6 pm, national, and 1 pm, international), cold \nchain  expert  (1  pm,  national,  and  1  pm,  international),  master  planner  (2  pm),  project \nfinance/PPP (4 pm), Legal/PPP contracts expert (3 pm), environmentalist (2 pm) and social \ndevelopment (3 pm).  The TA will finance the services of consultants who will be engaged \nthrough a firm by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. It is \nrecommended to use quality-based selection (QBS) because (i) the assignment is technically \ncomplex  requiring  highly  specialized  experts  on  undertaking  project  development  from  a \nconceptual stage, structuring it for PPP approach, and taking responsibility up to the successful \nidentification of private sector partners for implementation; (ii) the assignment is institutionally \ncomplex requiring experts on policy and strategic issues with the concerned State Governments \nfor  development  and  implementation  of  modern  agri-business  supply  chains  through  PPP \napproach, including food parks, agri-business centers and the necessary linking infrastructure \nalong the value chain; and (iii) ADB is new in the agribusiness sector in India and the outcome \nof this TA is key in finalizing a Project acceptable to the Government of India. The terms of \nreference for consulting services are in Appendix 5. Disbursements under the TA will be done in \naccordance with the ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (January 2008, as \namended from time to time).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "6   \nIV.

POVERTY ISSUES \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \nAgriculture growth has fallen from an average of 3.5% in 1982\u20131997 to only around 2% in 1998\u20132005. This has adversely \naffected the rural economy, and the overall level of poverty and social development in the country as the sector employs 56.7% \nof the country\u2019s workforce and provides livelihood to two-thirds of the population. The rural-urban divide has worsened, and it is \nestimated that per capita household expenditure in rural India is now less than half that in urban areas. With nearly three-\nquarters of the country\u2019s poor (or nearly 220 million people) living in rural areas, agriculture and rural development are critical to \npoverty reduction and inclusive development. Two-thirds of India\u2019s people derive their livelihood from agriculture, which is \ndominated by a large number of small farmers: of the nearly 120 million individual farm holdings comprising 170 million \nhectares (ha), roughly 60% are less than 1 ha while another 20% are only 1\u20132 ha in size.  \n \nIndia\u2019s 11th five year plan (2007-2012) prioritizes reducing regional and rural-urban disparity, and chronic poverty, particularly in \nrural areas, through inclusive and equitable growth, with a strong focus on accelerating the growth rate in underdeveloped \nregions. The proposed Agribusiness Infrastructure Development Project (AIDP) (the Project) is consistent with the Government \ndevelopment plans and ADB\u2019s strategy, by recognizing that greater crop diversification and value addition in agriculture has the \npotential to significantly reduce poverty and improve the quality of life in rural India. The AIDP is in line with the 11th Five Year \nPlan (2008-2012) as it addresses the three main constraints to agriculture growth: (i) out-of-date technologies; (ii) lack of public \ninvestment in basic infrastructure; and (iii) limited diversification.   \n \nGiven the high inefficiencies and extremely high post harvest losses, there is a large untapped potential in the agribusiness \nindustry, which if developed will have strong multiplier effects on employment, equitable income growth throughout the \neconomy, reduced vulnerability, household food security, higher farm and non farm incomes, that can lead to poverty reduction. \nDiversification of Indian agriculture and increased efficiencies in the value chain will contribute to the goal of reducing poverty \nby raising the productivity of land and water resources in a sustainable manner and augmenting the accrued economies. \nPrivate sector participation in such activities can reduce the burden on central and state finances, and ensure greater \nefficiency.  \n \nB.     Targeting Classification          \n1.  Select the targeting classification of the project: \n \n General Intervention (GI)   Individual or Household (TI-H);  Geographic (TI-G);  Non-Income MDGs (TI-M1, M2, etc.) \n \n2.   Explain the basis for the targeting classification:  \nC.  Poverty Analysis \n3.  If GI, is there any opportunity for pro-poor design (e.g., social inclusion subcomponents, cross subsidy, pro-poor \ngovernance, and pro-poor growth)? \n \nBihar is the third most populous state in India accounting for one seventh of India\u2019s population below poverty line. It is a state \nknown nation wide as a BIMARU (Sick) state due to high rate of persistent poverty, complete and dynamic social structure, and \nweak and corrupt governance as well as inferior infrastructure. Bihar has the lowest per capita income among the major states \nof India: Bihar\u2019s per capita income, which was about 60% of the average for India during the early 1960s, declined to about 40 \nper cent in 1993-94 and further to 34 per cent in 1997-98. Occupational structure reveals the dependence of majority of work \nforce on agriculture. Agricultural sector accounts for over 80% of the state\u2019s workforce, yet contributes only 40% to the state\u2019s \nGDP. The state endowed with rich natural resources and depending heavily on agriculture has more agricultural laborers \n(13,417,744) than cultivators (8,193,621) according to the 2001 census. And the minimum agricultural wage in the state is just \nRs. 81. The rural poor typically own less land and it has been estimated that 75% of the rural poor in Bihar were landless or \nnear-landless in 1999-2000. Despite concerted and regular efforts of the National as well as State Governments aimed at \npoverty reduction, there is still a huge gap which has to be addressed. This is evident that the per capita income of Bihar \n ", "12  Appendix 2 \ncontinues to be the lowest in the country standing at Rs. 6,610 as of December 2007. \n \nMaharashtra, on the contrary, has the image of being a fairly developed agro-industrial state, with a per capita income of Rs \n28,204, well above the nation\u2019s per capita income of Rs 20,989. As per Net State Domestic Product (NSDP) Maharashtra stood \nsecond only to Haryana among all major states in 2003-04. It is among the richest states in terms of contribution to the national \neconomy. The state boasts of an enterprising farming community growing among other things sugarcane, Alphonso mangoes \nand grapes. Despite these advantages, incidence of poverty in the state has continued to remain close to the national average. \nOfficial estimates of people below the poverty line at 25 per cent for the state in 1999-2000 is just a little lower than the all-India \naverage of 26 per cent. Maharashtra has some of the poorest and most underdeveloped regions in the country. The \nimbalanced growth in the state is essentially due to disproportionate growth in secondary and tertiary sectors vis-\u00e0-vis \nagriculture; 60 percent of people are dependent on agriculture for a living, but the share of agricultural output in state revenue \nhas decreased from 42 percent in 1960, to 17 percent in recent years. The largest numbers of workers in Maharashtra are in \nthe agricultural sector. Around 58 percent of all farm households in the state are reported to be in debt. There are large tracts \nunder cotton, but production is so un-remunerative that a large number of farmers\u2019 suicides have been reported in recent years \nin this area.  \n \nBy developing modern agricultural value chains, the project will contribute to poverty reduction by (i) more equitable distribution \nof income, (ii) growth of small and marginal farmers with greater access to markets and opportunities for value addition to their \nproducts, (iii) increased remittances to rural households, (iv) increased household food security, and (v) expanded opportunities \nfor skill enhancement and specialization in agricultural operations. Targeted initiatives to develop agribusiness will motivate \npoor farmers to shift from the cultivation of low returns traditional crops to high-value crops. This would increase returns to the \nfarmers, as well as agricultural wages. \n \nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \nA.  Initial Social Analysis \nBased on existing information: \n1.  Who are the potential primary beneficiaries of the project? How do the poor and the socially excluded benefit from the \nproject? \n \nThe interventions under the proposed components of the project are aimed at all-round development of the agribusiness sector \nin the selected states, which would initiate the process of transformation of the rural economy by reducing the direct \ndependence of rural households on agriculture for employment. The project seeks to benefit the supply side actors (small \nfarmers, enterprises and labor) as well as the consumers.  While the supply side participants benefit in terms of better incomes, \ncapacity development, access to new technology etc., the consumers benefit through better product quality, variety and \navailability. \n \nThe expected outcome of the project is an increasingly competitive agribusiness sector established through the adoption of \nagribusiness practices in the horticulture sector leading to higher value addition and higher incomes to the farmers, farm \nworkers, processors and entrepreneurs, including women. By developing modern agricultural value chains, the project will \nassist small and marginal farmers to associate and enter national and global markets. Furthermore, with the proposed \ninterventions, the small farmers will be able to improve the quality of their produce and productivity, reduce losses and take \nmore informed decisions regarding what to produce, how to produce, when and where to sell and at what price. The project will \ntherefore help small farmers to function more as businesspersons rather than as exploited growers.  The enterprises linked with \nagriculture, particularly small and medium enterprises, will benefit from economies of scale through better cooperation and \ncoordination with other participants in the value chain, and also improve their productivity and quality by gaining access to new \ntechnology and marketing opportunities.  The workers will be able to upgrade their skills (and therefore incomes), and will have \nmore employment opportunities with the development of the entire value chain. \n \n2.  What are the potential needs of beneficiaries in relation to the proposed project? \n \nLimited access to capital, small landholdings, inadequate marketable volumes, and limited bargaining power constrain the \nability of small farmers to cultivate higher-value crops. The formation of producers\u2019 companies will improve the participation of \nthe poorest farmers as viable units in the agribusiness value chain. By promoting producer companies, farmers\u2019 associations, \ncooperatives or self-help groups, farmers, including small, marginal and women farmers, collectively will in fact be encouraged \nto take-up primary processing and marketing activities at the farm level. As a result, farmers would earn better returns without \nthe involvement of intermediaries such as commission agents and wholesalers. The Project interventions are expected to lead \nto higher returns for the farmers, including small, marginal and women farmers. \n \n3.  What are the potential constraints in accessing the proposed benefits and services, and how will the project address \nthem? \n \nSmall farmers\u2019 production is supply-driven because of the lack of integration between producing and consuming areas. As a \n ", "  Appendix 2  13 \nresult, small and marginal farmers have difficulties in choosing the most profitable cropping patterns and are especially \nvulnerable to falling commodity prices because of their inability to switch rapidly to alternatives. The project will contribute to \ncapacity development of the beneficiaries across the value chain, to access and use information to their benefit.  This would \nalso open up new avenues for cooperation / linkages among the various players along the value chain.  The capacity \ndevelopment will enable better planning and management of inputs, outputs and logistics.  \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1. Indicate the potential initial stakeholders. \n2. What type of consultation and participation is required during the PPTA or project processing (e.g., workshops, community \nmobilization, involvement of nongovernment organizations and community-based organizations, etc.)? \n \nDuring  the  first  TA,  Project  components  were  identified  on  the  basis  of  sector  stakeholders\u2019  priorities  at  State  level \nconsultations. Public consultations and field surveys were carried out. Crucial stakeholders for the design of the project \nincluded public, private and cooperative sectors at the central and state levels, as well as farmers, entrepreneurs, trade \norganizations, and financial institutions at the state and local levels. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) also play \nsupportive roles and as such will be consulted as well. As part of public and stakeholder consultation for preparation of Initial \nEnvironment Examination, meetings and discussions were held with national and local government officials in both states and \ndiscussions were held with local people. Interviews were also carried out with selected communities during the field visits. \n \nDuring the implementation of the TA (second phase), mainly the private sector stakeholders will be consulted for the \npreparation of the detailed projects reports of the identified value chains. A general Stakeholders' consultations to increase \nownership of project by local rural communities will also be carried out. \n3.  What level of participation is envisaged for project design? \n     Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making         Empowerment \n \n4.  Will a consultation and participation plan be prepared?    Yes          No    Please explain.  \nThe implementation of the  TA  will require a participatory  approach  due to  diverse interests of the stakeholders. The \nparticipation strategy will be developed under the TA.   \n \n \nC.  Gender and Development \n1. What are the key gender issues in the sector and/or sub-sector that are likely to be relevant to this project or program? \n \nDue to the unequal access of women to productive resources and the prevailing gender discrimination within traditional \nhouseholds, women bear a disproportionately higher burden of poverty. Agriculture continues to be the most significant area of \nwomen\u2019s work participation, whether as workers on household farms owned or tenanted by their families, or as wage workers. \nWomen constitute 30% of the enumerated work force, with 90% of them working in rural areas as wage labor or working on own \nfarms. Their role as domestic agricultural workers is often not reflected in the national statistics: only 9.4% female workers, as \nopposed to 17.8% male workers, are recorded as cultivators, which imply a lower status for women within the socially recognized \nhierarchy of agricultural tasks undertaken. In 1999-2000, 748 of every 1,000 women were employed in agriculture and related \nactivities, making it significant from the gender perspective.  \n \nWomen are known to work in all capacities, in growing food, post-harvest operations, marketing, animal husbandry and related \nactivities. It is estimated that sometimes women's work could be longer than men's work by as much as 43%. Women tend to \nperform the more unskilled and menial tasks in agriculture and are likely to be paid less, notwithstanding the significant time they \ndevote to agriculture. Their wages tend to be only about 71% of those of men. Allied to this is the fact that women seldom have \ntitle to land in their own names and they are unable to make autonomous decisions regarding property or their households, even \nwhen they become heads of households on being widowed or in the absence of male family members who may have emigrated.  \n \n2. Does the proposed project or program have the potential to promote gender equality and/or women\u2019s empowerment by \nimproving women\u2019s access to and use of opportunities, services, resources, assets, and participation in decision making?   \n  Yes          No    Please explain. \n \nIncreasing feminization of horticulture, evidenced by the first TA analysis, is likely to further increase women\u2019s work participation \nrates in high-value crops and value addition. In addition, women\u2019s traditional role in agriculture is at the post-harvest stage, and \nany expansion in agribusiness activities would create more opportunities mainly for women. Recognizing the potential for female \nentrepreneurship, the project design includes a set of activities on women in agribusiness, which would promote individual and \ngroup-based entrepreneurship though established self-help groups (SHG) of female farmers involved in horticulture operations. \nThe activities will aim to have female farmers take on new chain activities, by enhancing their technical knowledge and chain \nmanagement skills.  \n ", "14  Appendix 2 \n \nBased on a systematic gender analysis of the role women in modern agriculture value chains, a comprehensive Gender Action \nPlan will be developed during the TA implementation, with the following key elements:  \n\u2022  Facilitation of the emergence of women as agribusiness entrepreneurs; \n\u2022  Capacity building through women agribusiness entrepreneurship development programs, based on sound business \nprinciples;  \n\u2022  Focus on group-based entrepreneurship, considering dominance of small and medium farmers/entrepreneurs/home \nbased food processors;  \n\u2022  Development of chain management skills; \n\u2022  Training and capacity building to enhance skills in farming, crop and financial management should target 30% to 50% of \nwomen; \n\u2022  Women-specific training camps should be organized. Each value chain should be equipped with a mobile van for training \nwomen which have limited mobility. \n\u2022  To better target women, training modules should be designed in collaboration with local groups of stakeholders, women\u2019s \ngroups, NGOs, and SHGs. \n \n3. Could the proposed project have an adverse impact on women and/or girls or widen gender inequality? \n          Yes          No     \nNo adverse issues for women are anticipated. \n \nIII.
