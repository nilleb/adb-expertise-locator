The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  provided  broad-based  assistance  to  the \nGovernment  of  Sri  Lanka  for  the  education  sector,  covering  secondary  education,  post-\nsecondary education and technical education and vocational training (TEVT). Building on its \nachievements, the Government requested, with ADB concurrence, inclusion of an Education \nSector Development Program (ESDP) loan in the Country Strategy and Program Update (2006\u2013\n2008)1.  The  Fact-Finding  Mission  for  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA), \nconducted from 17\u201325 October 2005, reached an understanding with the Government on the \nobjectives, scope, methodology, implementation arrangements, cost estimates, financing plan, \nand consulting services required for the proposed TA.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The goal of education in Sri Lanka is to produce skilled citizens who are capable of \ncompeting  in  the  global  market  and  contributing  to  the  country\u2019s  economic  growth  and \nknowledge development. Education also supports the upward socioeconomic mobility of the \npoorest segments of the population and increases equity of opportunity across regions and \namong genders and ethnic groups. Sri Lanka has made remarkable strides in increasing literacy \nand  improving  gender  equity  in  compulsory  basic  education  enrollment.  However,  key \nchallenges remain. At the junior secondary level, 18% of children do not complete grade 9, with \nthe poor and the disadvantaged affected disproportionately. At the senior secondary level, only \n42% of students pass the ordinary level (O-level) national examination, while only 40% of \nadvanced level (A-level) students pass the A-level national examination. At the tertiary level, the \nuniversity system has such limited intake capacity that only 11% of those who qualify enroll. The \nunemployment rate for O-level graduates is 12%, while unemployment for A-level and above is \n17%. That is partially because the labor market does not grow fast enough to absorb the \ngraduates,  and  partially  because  the  education  system  fails  to  equip  graduates  with  the \nknowledge and skills required to get jobs. \n \n3.  The high dropout rates at the junior secondary level and poor performance in O-level \nand A-level qualification exams result from a lack of investment in quality educational facilities \nand capable, motivated teachers. Key subjects like mathematics, science, and languages have \nbeen particularly neglected. While the problems affect schools across the country, the conflict-\naffected North Eastern Province and resource-starved rural and plantation areas are hardest hit. \nThe shortage of teachers in science, mathematics, and English is especially acute in the Tamil \nmedium, while almost all poor regions lack access to science and technology subjects. The \nunequal  distribution  of  teachers  among  different  regions  of  the  country  exacerbates  such \nregional disparities. Ultimately, children from disadvantaged districts have little chance to break \ninto areas with better income and employment prospects. \n \n4.  Those who fail their O-level and A-level examinations have few options to continue their \neducation. Not only is TEVT substandard, but there are also few chances to move up within the \nexisting TEVT system. This hampers TEVT's potential to address unemployment, build skill-\nbased  competitiveness,  and  develop  students  with  the  right  combination  of  attitude  and \nvocational  aptitude.  In  general,  there  is  no  systematic  link  between  TEVT  and  the  higher \neducation system. This makes it hard for students to forge upwardly mobile, life-long career \npaths. The intake capacity of tertiary education is well below the average for South Asia. Those \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2005. Country Strategy and Program Update (2006\u20132008): Sri Lanka. Manila.  \n2 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 14 November 2005.  \n ", "2   \nwho cannot enter public universities enroll in external degree programs or in non-degree private \npost-secondary institutions or private institutions affiliated with foreign universities. However, \nfew  regulatory  impediments  are  placed  in  the  way  of  establishing  private  post-secondary \ninstitutions and no quality standards or accreditation system exists. External degree programs \nsuffer  from  poor  quality  and  weak  administration.  The  curriculum  of  the  current  university \nsystem should be upgraded and tailored to equip graduates with marketable skills. \n \n5.  The Government is committed to improving the quality of education by making the \ncurriculum more relevant, improving teaching, assessment, and educational management, and \nextending educational opportunities to the poor and disadvantaged. The Government recently \ndeveloped an education sector development framework and program (ESDFP) that aims to \nimprove the delivery of primary and secondary education services. The ESDFP is supported by \nseveral external funds, including the World Bank-funded Education Sector Development Grant \n(ESDG)  and  ongoing  ADB  loans  on  secondary  education.3  ESDG  uses  an  outcome-  and \nperformance-based  allocation  system  to  provide  budgetary  support  to  both  central  and \nprovincial education budgets. It focuses on improving the quality of schools, teachers, and non-\nformal education. A number of bilateral agencies and United Nations agencies support the same \nareas through teacher training, education for social cohesion, and support to schools in conflict-\naffected areas. \n \n6.  Between 1999 and 2010, ADB is investing in several spheres of secondary and post-\nsecondary education, including TEVT, through a series of five investment loans.4 These projects \nhave been relatively successful so far. However, the limited scope of these projects makes them \nislands of excellence within a system that remains inefficient and slow to improve. Therefore, \nfuture ADB investments in education should move gradually away from projects and toward \nsector-wide program investment. A program framework that spells out goals and strategies, \nincluding existing investments in secondary and post-secondary education (including TEVT), will \nbe developed. The ESDP, which will be integrated into, and liked, with the ESDFP, will address \nthe gaps in investment between the ongoing loans and support key priority areas through \nsubprojects and subprograms. It has been suggested that the ESDP become a cluster of sector-\nwide program investment with a longer span. \n  \n7.  The ultimate goals of ESDP (or cluster of ESDP loans) will be: An education system that \nprovides a variety of learning options in each cycle of education and equips all children with the \nknowledge and skills they need to compete in and benefit from the knowledge economy. The \nESDP will have a two-pronged strategy: (i) improved education designed to supply a strong \nbase of human capital to a knowledge-based economy; this will be achieved through expanded \nsecondary and tertiary education, provision of technical skills training, and expanded use of \ninformation and communication technology (ICT); and (ii) reducing poverty, minimizing regional \nand ethnic disparities, and bridging the digital divide by providing the poorest segments of the \npopulation with equal access to high quality, relevant secondary and tertiary education. \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2000.

The ICT components of most ongoing projects have focused on supplying PCs and \nsoftware and providing in-service teacher training, usually managed by the project management \noffice. Although some schools have effectively used ICT in teaching, challenges remain to make \nICT components effective. These components tend to place a heavy burden on the project \nmanagement office, and entail risks for the Government for irregularities related to procurement \nof PCs. The ESDP will establish a Fund for Innovative ICT for Learning (FIIL), to be managed \nby the Executing Agency, that will call for public and private institutions to propose innovative \napproaches for using ICT in schools. The proposals will be selected on a competitive basis by a \nselection committee based on a comprehensive set of criteria that includes: (i) relevance; (ii) \nquality of services; (iii) cost-effectiveness; and (iv) sustainability. The selected institution(s) will \nprovide a complete package of services that includes (a) needs assessment, (b) supply of \nhardware and software; (c) training and coaching for schools and teachers, (d) maintenance, \nand (e) monitoring and evaluation. The Government will commission a process and impact \nevaluation study of the services provided before deciding whether to terminate the contract or \nscale up the initiative. Foreign institutions that form partnerships with local institutions will also \nbe eligible to bid under FIIL.  \n \n9.  In Sri Lanka, the HIV infection rate among adults between the ages of 15 and 49 is \nestimated to be less than 0.2%.5 Though the number of HIV/AIDS6 cases in Sri Lanka is still \nlow, extensive HIV risk factors are prevalent. These include unsafe sexual behavior and drug-\ninjecting practices, and a high degree of migration for employment. Without vigorous action to \nprevent the spread of HIV, Sri Lanka is susceptible to an AIDS epidemic. Low HIV/AIDS \nawareness is the main challenge. Youth, women, and underserved communities are particularly \nunaware of the problem and particularly vulnerable. A comprehensive HIV/AIDS preventive \neducation program at the national level has yet to be established. ESDP  will support the \nintegration of HIV/AIDS education in the school curriculum, pre-service and in-service teacher \ntraining. A separate TA funded by the Swedish International Development Agency (Sida) will \nundertake an in-dept assessment of the priority areas of intervention. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.   The TA will help the Government: (i) develop an overall framework for the ESDP in line \nwith and/or building upon existing policy documents, studies, programs, and projects related to \neducation; and (ii) design ESDP as a sector development program or other suitable lending \nprogram. The TA will assess the ongoing projects supported by ADB and other donors and \nidentify the major gaps. It will identify priority areas of investment that may be supported as \nsubprojects or subprograms within the ESDP. Areas of priority interventions may include: (i) \nquality  improvement  of  secondary  schools,  (ii)  expansion  of  non-state  tertiary  education \nprovision, (iii) support for innovative approaches to expand ICT for learning, and (iv) a special \ncomponent on HIV/AIDS preventive education. The TA will study the feasibility of establishing \nFIIL.  It  will  assess  possible  funding  mechanisms  for  ESDP  and  identify  suitable  lending \nmodalities.  The  outcomes  of  the  TA  will  be:  (i)  an  ESDP  overall  framework  that  covers \nsecondary education and post-secondary education, including TEVT; the ESDP will include \ngoals, two-pronged strategies, a plan, and outcome indicators for the education sector; it will be \nconsistent with the strategies, monitoring framework, and goals of the ESDFP; (ii) an agreed \n                                                 \n5  Estimate made by the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS). \n6  HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is the virus that causes AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). ", "4   \nESDP loan design that includes the rationale, objectives, subprojects, costs, implementation \narrangements  (including  a  fund-flow  mechanism),  procurement  modalities,  and  economic, \nfinancial, and social analyses. The ESDP design will include a special component on HIV/AIDS \npreventive education. It is expected that future ADB investment in education and training will \ncomply with the education sector strategy laid out under the ESDP. The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. The initial conceptual design for the ESDP is in Supplementary \nAppendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities  \n11.   The TA will help the Government review existing national policy documents and sector \nand subsector studies. It will assess the progress, achievement, and challenges of ongoing \nprojects supported by ADB and other donors. It will review the existing labor market analysis, \nassess  industrial  needs,  and  review  the  strategic  link  between  human  capital  growth  and \neconomic development. It will review the ESDFP and assess how the ESDP can be linked to \nthe strategies and goals of the ESDFP. This analysis will help stakeholders design the ESDP. \nBased on the ESDP, the TA will further help identify the major gaps of the ongoing projects. It \nwill  help  stakeholders  identify  priority  areas  of  intervention  and  develop  subprojects  and \nsubprograms. It will assess the funding mechanism initiated by ESDG and the performance of \nboth  central  and  provincial  government  institutions  in  program  and  financial  management. \nBased  on  the  analysis,  it  will  suggest  possible  funding  mechanisms  and  implementation \narrangements for ESDP. \n \n12.  The TA will adopt a stakeholder-led approach. It will involve officials from the Ministry of \nEducation (MOE), Ministry of Skills Development and Vocational Training, Ministry of Finance, \nprovincial authorities, public and private tertiary education institutions, the industry sector, ICT \ntraining institutions, and stakeholders involved in the ongoing projects. It will facilitate thematic \nworking groups in the following suggested areas: (i) secondary education; (ii) tertiary education; \n(iii) ICT for learning; and (iv) industry needs and links with education. Stakeholders involved in \nthe Skills for Development Project and the Technical Education Development Project will join \nthe TA to form a thematic working group on TEVT and linkage with general education. Key \nstakeholders involved in ESDFP will also be invited to join the discussions. The TA will further \norganize seminars, zonal and school-level consultations, and surveys and data collections as \nnecessary. As donor harmonization is critical, the TA will organize donor consultative meetings \nat each key milestone of the ESDP development process. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.   The TA is expected to cost $870,000 equivalent, of which ADB will provide $700,000 to \ncover the entire foreign exchange component of $478,000 and local currency costs of $222,000 \nequivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. ADB will \nfinance  domestic  and  international  consulting  services,  production  of  reports,  equipment, \norganization of workshops, studies, field surveys, and administrative and support services. The \nGovernment will support the TA with an in-kind contribution estimated at $170,000 equivalent. It \nwill include the provision of counterpart staff, office accommodation and meeting space, and \ngeneral office support. A detailed financing plan and cost estimates are in Appendix 2. The \nGovernment has been advised that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to financing an \nensuing lending program.  \n \n ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  MOE will be the Executing Agency for the TA. At TA inception, an ESDP steering \ncommittee will be established. It will be chaired by the Secretary of Education and will include \nrepresentatives from the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Skills Development and Vocational \nTraining, National Education Commission, National Institute of Education, National Examination \nand Testing Services, University Grant Commission, and chambers of commerce. A monthly \nsteering committee meeting will be organized and chaired by the secretary of education. MOE \nhas nominated two managers to form an ESDP task force, to be supervised by a senior MOE \nadvisor. Biweekly meetings of the ESDP task force will be held and chaired by the senior MOE \nadvisor. The ESDP task force will lead the TA process, guide the consultants, and liaise with \nsenior  MOE  officials,  other  Government  officials,  and  other  stakeholders.  The  Secondary \nEducation Modernization Project management office will provide overall assistance to the TA \nand the ESDP task force.                    \n \n15.  A team of five international and 10 domestic consultants will be recruited to provide \nspecialist  services  totaling  66.5  person  months  (19.5  international, 47  domestic).  ADB  will \nengage consultants through a firm using quality- and cost-based selection and the simplified \ntechnical procedure in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the selection and engagement of domestic consultants. \nOne  or  two  consultants  will  be  recruited  individually  and  mobilized  before  the  rest  of  the \nconsultant team. Indicative terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. Office \nequipment  will  be  procured  by  the  consultants  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement and will be turned over to MOE upon TA completion.   \n \n16.  The TA will begin in January 2006 and end in October 2006. One or two individual \nconsultants  will  be  mobilized  in  January  2006  to  initiate  the  sector-wide  work  and  policy \ndialogues, while the consultant team will be mobilized around March 2006. An inception report \nwill be submitted at the end of the 1st month of the TA. A draft of the ESDP framework will be \ncompleted and submitted as a first interim report within 2 months after the first consultant team \nhas  been  mobilized.  A  revised  ESDP  framework  and  an  initial  ESDP  loan  design  will  be \nsubmitted as a second interim report by the end of the 4th month. A draft final report will be \nsubmitted along with a draft ESDP loan design by the end of the 6th month. One or more \nconsultation  workshops  involving  all  stakeholders,  including  donors,  will  be  held  after  the \nsubmission of each report. A complete final report, incorporating comments from all parties \nconcerned, should be submitted by the TA completion date. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $700,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for Preparing the Education Sector Development \nProgram, and hereby reports this action to the Board.

About 3.9 million students\u2014or about 95% of the total students in grades 1\u201313\u2014are \nenrolled in about 9,800 government schools in Sri Lanka. Female students make up around 50% of total student \npopulation. The net enrollment rates for primary education (ages 6\u201310 or grades 1\u20135) were 95.7% in 1996, and \n96.3% in 2002. The net enrollment rates for junior secondary education (ages 11\u201314, or grades 6\u20139) were 93.8% in \n1996, and 96.3% in 2002.2 While the grade 5 completion rate improved from 68.1% in 1990 to 95.6% in 2002, about \n18% of children still fail to complete compulsory education up to grade 9.3 In 2002, 41.6% of school candidates who \nsat the O-level examination were qualified for A-level, and 55.7% of those who sat the A-level examination were \nqualified for university, of whom only 13.3% were admitted in universities. \n \nDespite the relatively high achievement in terms of enrollment and literacy, it has not substantially contributed to \npoverty reduction. In 2002, 23.9% of the population remained poor in the country.4 The poverty rate is much smaller \nin the urban sector (7.6%) than in the rural sector (26.4%). In the Uva and North Central provinces, the number of \npoor households increased between 1995 and 2002. The ongoing civil conflict in the North and East has adversely \naffected the population in those areas. Poverty in the region has increased significantly, disrupting children\u2019s \neducation. \n \nSri Lanka\u2019s poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP)5 points out that the quality of education provided in rural \nschools remains very poor. Many remote schools suffer from severe teacher shortages. About 20% of the country's \n9,800 primary and secondary schools lack basic facilities such as desks, chairs, blackboards, and teaching \nmaterials. Absenteeism is extremely high in rural areas, and many poor students learn little in school. In 2004, 5.2% \nof 185,955 teachers were untrained, but the proportion of untrained teachers was higher in the North Eastern and \nUva provinces, and in the Nuwara Eliya and Puttalam districts. The O-level pass rate was 44.0% on average in \n2003, ranging from 61.7% in Colombo and 49.6% in Ampara, to 29.3% in Mullaitivu and 27.7% in Kilinochchi. There \nare 621 Type 1AB schools in the country, which enroll 29.5% of total students in the country\u2014ranging from 49.1% of \nstudents in Colombo and 44.5% in Galle, to 19.0% in Nuwara Eliya and 16.3% in Mullaitivu. The proportion of \nstudents in the science stream at A-level was 23.0% on average in 2004, but much lower in Kilinochchi, Vavuniya, \nMullaitivu, Trincomalee, and Nuwara Eliya Districts. The PRSP recognizes that limited access to quality education \nfor the poor in rural areas is one of the fundamental causes of poverty, and stresses the need to create opportunities \nfor pro-poor growth by improving the quality of rural education, which will empower the rural youth with skills \napplicable to employment. \n \nWage statistics clearly illustrate that education is an important way out of poverty. for instance, the average annual \nwage differential between grade 6\u20139 and O-level achievers is SLRs43,056 ($430); between O-level and A-level \nachievers it is SLRs33,108 ($331).6 The incidence of poverty is the highest in households whose principal income \nearner has no schooling (58%), and lowest in households whose principal income earner is a graduate (5%). Almost \n90% of the total poor come from households whose principal income earner left school at some stage prior to O-\nlevel;  \n \n                                                 \n1  Government of Ceylon. 1945.

", "8  Appendix 2  \n \n \nEach year, around 120,000 people between the ages of 10 and 29 enter the labor force.7 The unemployment rate \nwas 8.8% for all age groups, but higher among youth: 30.1% for the 15\u201319 age group, and 20.1% for the 20\u201329 age \ngroup in 2002. About 60% of the unemployed are in the 20\u201329 age group. The unemployment rate is particularly \nhigh among educated youth\u201416.8% for A-level achievers and above. In other words, almost 50% of the unemployed \nare either O-level qualified (about 27% of the total unemployed) or A-level qualified (about 20%). These statistics \nsuggest that the present education system, which focuses on traditional courses, may not cater to the emerging \nneeds of the labor market, where demand is growing for science, engineering, information technology, financial \nmanagement, marketing, and English-language skills. The unemployment rate is also higher among females (12.9%) \nthan males (6.6%), reflecting high gender inequality in the labor market. \n \nEven though high unemployment among educated youth has received high-profile attention as a major social \nproblem, unemployment among less educated people is just as problematic. About 40\u201350% of all unemployed \npeople have completed only grades 5\u201310.7 Given that 18% of students do not complete compulsory education, and \nonly 41.6% pass the O-level examination, as mentioned above, there is a strong need to improve the quality of junior \nsecondary education and the retention of students at that level. \nThe lack of equitable access to high-quality junior and senior secondary education is largely caused by disparities \namong schools in terms of infrastructure such as science laboratories; libraries and ICT equipment; teaching and \nlearning materials; the quality and number of teachers in mathematics, science, and ICT; and the ability to raise \nfunds for school development. The lack of access to quality science and technology instruction results in children \nfrom disadvantaged districts being excluded from fields like medicine, engineering technology, and information \ntechnology, where the best employment and income prospects lie. To address unequal distribution of educational \nfacilities, the National Education Commission in 1998 recommended that education policies be adopted that \nencourage more equitable distribution of education. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                       Targeting Classification: Targeted Intervention  \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nBecause poverty is multidimensional in nature, various aspects of poverty, including spatial, ethnic, and gender \ncharacteristics, need to be assessed in order to design a project that will effectively address the multifarious needs of \nand constraints facing disadvantaged groups in relation to their successful participation in education. Poverty-related \nfactors that affect enrollment, attendance, retention, cycle completion, and progression to higher education rates \nneed to be analyzed. The academic performance of poor, disadvantaged, and ethnic minority children needs to be \nassessed  Based  on  these  analyses,  preventive  measures  to  improve  access  to  high-quality  education  for \ndisadvantaged students, and measures to lower the dropout rate should be proposed. A review of the impact of the \ncurrent school financing policies on equity in schooling, and a estimate of the resources required to improve equity \nshould be made.  \n \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \n Is there a participation strategy?      Yes                   No \n \nExtensive consultations with stakeholders in secondary and post-secondary education need to be conducted to \nidentify the strengths and weaknesses of secondary and post-secondary education from the beneficiaries\u2019 point of \nview. The main stakeholders include direct beneficiaries of education (secondary  school students and post-\nsecondary  school  graduates  and  indirect  beneficiaries  (parents,  principals,  teachers,  members  of  school \nmanagement committees, and education officials). Stakeholder consultations should discuss the strengths and \nweaknesses of government decentralization, school governance policies from each stakeholder\u2019s point of view, the \npreparation of school development plans, and the preparation of zonal and provincial educational development \nplans.  \n \n                                                 \n7  Department of Census and Statistics. 2004. Employment and Unemployment in Sri Lanka\u2014Trends, Issues and Options. \nColombo: Government Press. \n ", "  Appendix 2  9 \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women \nWomen in Sri Lanka enjoy universal suffrage, high life expectancy, and high literacy, but there is still a visible gender \ngap that leaves women with fewer educational and professional opportunities than men. A higher proportion of \nstudents\u201452.0% of O-level students 57.5% of A-level students\u2014are female, but they tend to study more in arts \n(where 66% of students are women) than in science (where 44.6% are women) or commerce (where 48.6% are \nwomen). Fewer women are admitted to universities than men. The lower enrollment of women in the sciences and in \nuniversities is partly explained by sociocultural factors. First, stereotypes about the role of women in society pushes \nwomen students toward the arts. Second, in rural areas where Type 1AB schools are not available, parents are \nreluctant to enroll their daughters in schools far from home for security reasons. These factors limit women's options \nfor employment prospects. The labor participation rate was much lower for females (33.6%) than for males (67.9%) \nin 2002. Furthermore, gender discrimination persists in the form of gender stereotyping in the labor force and wage \ndiscrimination. Females tend to be engaged either in low-skilled, low-paid jobs such as domestic service, garment \nmaking, and agriculture, or in traditional female occupations such as teaching, nursing, and typing. 60.3% of \nteachers are women, but women hold only 31.8% of managerial positions at schools. Hence, the Technical \nAssistance (TA) needs to further investigate the factors causing low enrollment of female students in the sciences \nand in universities, and suggest strategies to provide women with more opportunities. The TA also needs to analyze \nthe reasons why the gender gap persists in the labor market\u2014particularly in educational administration and school \nmanagement\u2014and suggest strategies to narrow that gap in the Sri Lankan context. \n \nE.

The education system in \nthe area was severely damaged.
