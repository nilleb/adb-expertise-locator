The Asian Development Outlook (ADO)1 has been a flagship publication of the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  since 1989.  It  is one  of  ADB\u2019s  main  vehicles  for enhancing  its \nreputation as a credible and authoritative source of knowledge about the region, by regularly \nmonitoring  and  providing  comprehensive  analysis  on  the  evolving  developments  in  its \ndeveloping member countries (DMCs). The ADO contributes to the intellectual environment in \nwhich policy formulation occurs, and its content informs ADB Management opinion and guides \ninstitutional views about prospective developments and other important issues. The production \nof the ADO has been regularly supported by technical assistance (TA) funding. The objectives, \nscope, and activities to be covered by the regional TA2 are in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Responding to clients\u2019 feedback and the rapidly changing marketplace for economic \ninformation and analysis, efforts to improve the quality of the ADO have intensified in recent \nyears. These efforts have focused on providing stronger analytical content and ensuring better \ncohesion and balance among its parts. If the ADO is to remain competitive and relevant as an \nindependent and credible source of knowledge and information about the region, continuous \nwork must be done to further improve the quality of its analysis. Activities will include the \ncommissioning of relevant applied and policy research at a country and regional level, the \ndevelopment of new sources of information, and strengthened peer review. High-quality editing \nservices are crucial to ensure that the ADO\u2019s key messages are communicated clearly and \neffectively.  To  increase  the  ADO\u2019s  regional  and  international  reach,  the  Economics  and \nResearch  Department  (ERD)  will  continue  to  collaborate  with  the  Department  of  External \nRelations (DER). \n \n3.  The ADO is one of the most frequently downloaded publications from ADB\u2019s website. It \nis directly or indirectly the source of much international and national news commentary that \nfeatures analysis, views, and opinions from ADB. Thus, a concerted effort, not just to come up \nwith a high-quality publication, but also to differentiate and disseminate ADO content, is vital to \nelevate the publication\u2019s profile.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n4.  The TA will support activities that will contribute to high-quality and comprehensive \neconomic analysis of the region and help ensure the usefulness and relevance of ADO to policy \ndialogue and formulation in DMCs. The improved content and structure of ADO 2009 and its \nupdate  is  expected  to  provide  in-depth,  relevant,  and  timely  assessment  of  the  region\u2019s \neconomy. Appendix 2 contains the draft contents pages of ADO 2009 and ADO 2009 Update. \nAs in the previous issues, the publication will be presenting original work on current and relevant \nthemes of interest within developing Asia and the Pacific. \n                                                 \n \n \n \n1  The ADO is sold externally, and is extensively reviewed and commented on in the media. It is one of the most \npopular documents on the ADB website. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 11 August 2008. \n ", "2   \n \n5.  The TA will further develop and refine analytical methods to support ADB\u2019s short- and \nmedium-term country economic monitoring and reporting. The methods will also strengthen the \neconomic underpinnings of country programs and strategies for the DMCs covered. \n  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n6.  The main outputs from the TA will be ADO 2009 and ADO 2009 Update. The TA will \nsupport  the  following  key  activities:  preparation  of  background  analytical  papers,  further \ndevelopment and refinement of analytical methods, drafting of ADO content, economic and copy \nediting, and preparation and layout of materials for publication. The objective of the papers will \nbe to provide a solid empirical and analytical foundation for ADO content. The papers will \nsupplement  the  research  work  of  ADB\u2019s  Macroeconomics  and  Finance  Research  Division \n(ERMF) on the selected topics, and will contain analysis of issues and policy implications for the \nDMCs covered using a review of existing literature, analyses of survey and macroeconomic \ndata, and modeling under different scenarios. Activities for the preparation of ADO 2010 will \nalso be supported under the TA.  \n  \n7.  To ensure accuracy, coherence, and consistency in approach across the different parts \nof the ADO, high-quality editing services are required. Economic and copy editing activities will \nbe  provided  by  international consultants  working  under  the  direction  of  the  assistant chief \neconomist, ERMF.  \n \n8.  Workshops and training directly relevant to the preparation and strengthening of ADO \ncontent will also be supported by the TA. The focus will be on macroeconomic analysis, growth \naccounting, economic projections, and effective writing skills, which will target economists in \nregional departments, national officers in resident missions, and, as appropriate, government \nofficials and other client groups. The objective of the training is to equip writers with the skills \nand the tools needed to craft high-quality country chapters. The training will also impart skills \nthat are of broader relevance for economic and sector work, which underpins country strategies.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n9.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $460,000 (Appendix 3). The TA will be financed \non a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n10.  ADB will be the Executing Agency responsible for implementing and monitoring the TA. \nIn particular, ERMF will implement the TA in close coordination with regional departments and \nresident missions. The assistant chief economist of ERMF, reporting to the chief economist of \nERD, will be responsible for implementation. Given the high institutional profile of the ADO, ERD \nwill report to the vice-president, Knowledge Management and Sustainable Development Group, \nthe managing director general, and the President at critical points in its preparation. \n \n11.  The development of analytical tools and approaches to support high-quality ADO content \nwill be a joint effort of ERMF economists, country economists of the regional departments and \nresident missions, national experts, international consultants, and economics editors. The TA \nwill finance the procurement of information and knowledge services as may be required to \nsupport  relevant  and  up-to-date  content.  Procurement  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \n ", "  3\nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). The TA is expected to start in \nDecember 2008 and to be completed by March 2010. \n \n12.  An ADO workshop is tentatively scheduled for January 2010 at ADB headquarters. The \nworkshop will present and discuss issues and directions on several topics for consideration and \ninclusion in the subsequent year\u2019s ADO. The TA will cover the travel expense of selected \nresident mission staff who will participate in the workshop. Contents of country chapters and \nother issues will also be discussed during the workshop. \n \n13.  An estimated 11 person-months (about five consultants) of international consultants\u2019 \ntime  will  be  required  for  economic  and  technical  editing  of  ADO  manuscripts  before  final \npublication of ADO 2009 and ADO 2009 Update. ADO will also require 5 person-months (about \ntwo  consultants)  of  international  consultancy  resources  for  preparing  background  papers. \nAnother 6 person-months (about two consultants) of national economic consultants\u2019 time will be \nrequired to assist in preparing country chapters and data sheets. The outline terms of reference \nfor the consultants and resource persons are in Appendix 4. The consultants will be hired as \nindividuals. Resource persons will also be engaged to conduct training workshops and prepare \nbackground papers on economic trends and prospects of selected DMCs. Consultants and \nresource  persons  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \n14.  The major results of ADO 2009 and ADO 2009 Update will be disseminated to the media, \nDMC policy makers, and civil society. Dissemination will be coordinated by DER in cooperation \nwith ERMF. Separate launches will be undertaken by resident missions in selected DMCs. Both \nADO 2009 and ADO 2009 Update will be featured on the ADB website, and printed copies will \nbe distributed worldwide. In countries where there is limited broadband access, CD-ROMs will \nbe made available through the resident missions. The TA may support translation of ADO into \nChinese, Russian, and other languages, as may be required, to extend its audience in selected \nDMCs. This will be arranged by regional departments in consultation with concerned resident \nmissions and DER. ERMF will work with DER to attempt to capture broader and more useful \nclient feedback.   \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n15.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $460,000 on a grant basis for \nthe Asian Development Outlook 2009, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n ", " 4  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   And Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \nInfluence the  Regional and  DER web download  \uf0b7  Key messages of ADO \nintellectual environment  international reach of  statistics  are communicated \nwithin which policy  ADO      effectively. \nformulation occurs and    Publicly available citation  \uf0b7  ADO reaches target \npromote ADB\u2019s  Media coverage and  data   audience in the policy \nreputation as an  readership    and development \nauthoritative and    ERMF and regional  community. \nindependent source of  Web downloads   department consultations  \uf0b7  There is a significant \nknowledge about the    with clients in country  degree of interest in \nregion.
