A  modern  and  market-friendly  legal  system,  which  clearly  defines  and  effectively \nreinforces legal rights for citizens and enterprises and is easily accessible to the poor, is \nfundamental in the transition from a centrally planned to a market economy. To support its \ntransition from a centrally planned to a socialist-oriented market economy, Viet Nam has been \nengaged in the momentous task of constructing a new legal system. The 1992 Constitution, with \nthe National Assembly\u2019s resolution of 2001, reflects this effort by underlining that Viet Nam is a \nsocialist state governed by the rule of law. \n  \n2.  The legal system development needs assessment (LNA), initiated by the Ministry of \nJustice  (MOJ)  under  a  multiagency  -  funded  preparatory  assistance  (PA)  project,  aims  at \ndeveloping a strategy and subsequently an action plan for developing a comprehensive legal \nsystem in Viet Nam. After successfully completing the LNA study and submitting its report to the \nPrime Minister in July 2002, MOJ received a go-ahead from the Prime Minister\u2019s Office for \nfurther work on the strategy for developing a comprehensive legal system up to year 2010. \nSince 2000, aid agencies including the Asian Development Bank (ADB), have been supporting \nthis initiative. In 1997, at the request of the Government, ADB provided technical assistance \n(TA) to MOJ for developing a national registry system for secured transactions (TA-2823 VIE).1 \nIts final report contains a design for further developing and expanding the  secured transactions \nregistration system, including a national database and nation wide computerized network for the \nregistry.2 Further expansion of registry services for secured transactions, including drafting of \nappropriate ordinances, is included in the measures and actions set out in the Financial Sector \nProgram Loan II.3 \n \n3.  The  Government  of  Viet  Nam  has  requested  ADB  to  grant  an  advisory  technical \nassistance (TA) to help (i) prepare implementation mechanisms for a Strategy for developing \nthe Viet Nam legal system up to year 2010 (SLSD) and (ii) build the capacity of the National \nRegistration Agency of Secured Transactions (NRAST). A Fact-Finding Mission4 from ADB \nvisited Hanoi during 4-28 October 2002 to discuss with the Government the TA\u2019s objectives, \nscope, and implementation arrangements.5 A wrap up meeting held on 25 October 2002 at MOJ \nto discussed the Mission\u2019s findings and finalized the proposed TA, and a memorandum of \nunderstanding was signed on 29 October 2002. \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n   \n4.  Legal System Development. Both the Party and the Government recognize that the \nestablishment and improvement of the legal system are essential parts of the Government\u2019s \ncontinuing policy reform to meet the aspirations of the people. Experience shows that to reach \nthe targets of the socio-economic development strategy for 2001-2010, it is necessary to have a \n                                                           \n1  ADB. 2000. Revised Final Report. Viet Nam National Registry for Secured Transactions. A tripartite meeting was \nheld in Hanoi on 5 April 2001 to conclude the TA project. \n2  It is understood that for establishing the centralized, computerized national registration system for secured \ntransactions together with the national database of secured transactions, the MOJ would seek funding from the \nFinancial  Sector  Program  Loan  II  during  2001-2002,  or  from  the  State-owned  Enterprises  and  Corporate \nGovernance Program Loan proceeds or appropriate Government resources. \n3  ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Financial \nSector Program Loan  II. \n4  R. B. Adhikari, Principal Governance Specialist, VRM; E. Araneta, Counsel, OGC (supported from HQ); and D.    \nV. Dung, Governance and Public Sector Reforms Specialist, VRM. \n5  The TA appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 16 September 2002 ", " 2  \n \ncorresponding legal system. For Viet Nam, for developing the strategy is new, difficult, and \nchallenging work that will require enormous efforts from all relevant state agencies, coordination \nof the entire political system, as well as assistance from the international community. \n \n5.  Building on the success of the LNA, a multiagency-funded Joint Formulation Mission \n(JFM) was held for 4 weeks starting from 4 November 2002 to map out priority areas and \nexternal  support,6  and  to  prepare  a  comprehensive  project  document  on  mechanism  for \nimplementing SLSD. The LNA report indicates 5 program areas7 with 27 subprograms and 268 \nactivities. Of the activities, 130 are categorized as priority projects, which the Government \nwishes to implement first with external support. The SLSD cuts across many sectors; it is also \nan important area embracing the Public Administration Reform \u2013 Master Program, 2001-2010.  \n \n6.  Secured  Transaction  Registry.  A  system  of  securing  assets,  both  movable  and \nimmovable,  is  fundamental  in  creating  an  effective  credit  market.  Credit  is  essential  for \neconomic and industrial development for it allows credit providers and entrepreneurs to pursue \nprojects, including purchase of property and development of infrastructure, in anticipation of \ninvestment returns or future earnings. If there is a legal regime for secured transactions that is \nperceived to give the providers of credit adequate protection from and remedies for failures of \ndebtors to pay, then security on property can become a major element of the investment \ndecision of both domestic and international investors. Security measures and an adequate legal \nframework  therefore  play  an  important  role  in  mobilizing  capital  to  meet  investors\u2019  needs. \nBorrowers also benefit from increased availability of credit, improved credit terms, and relatively \nreduced costs. Building the capacity for a secured transactions registry complements financial \nsector reform, particularly in developing an effective credit market. \n \n7.  Following  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s  decision,  a  dedicated  department  for  the  purpose \n(NRAST) was established in 2001. MOJ has established pilot branches (i.e., points of service, \nPOS) in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC). In Hanoi, over a period of about 7 months, the \ntotal number of registrations of security reached 10,000. Since the Ho Chi Minh City branch \nbegan operation in August 2002, about 2,000 transactions have been registered. Although very \nencouraging, these numbers are only a small fraction of the potential. The lack of adequate \ntechnical capacity and public awareness, and also the scope of the current legal framework for \nthis purpose constrain progress.  \n \n \nIII.   THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n8.  The TA is designed to address the noted issues in a two-pronged approach. It will assist \nMOJ in (i) preparing implementation mechanisms for SLSD and (ii) building capacity of NRAST. \nThe  first  component,  technical  support  in  preparing  implementation  mechanisms  for  a \ncomprehensive legal system leading up to 2010, will have special focus on priority projects \nselected  by  MOJ.  The  second  component  will  entail  drafting  an  ordinance  for  registering \nsecured  transactions,  improving  the  organization  and  operation  of  the  registration  system, \nincreasing POS, legal training, and public education and publicity programs.  \n \n                                                           \n6   VRM staff took part in the JFM. \n7   The five areas are (i) legislative and law-making reform; (ii) judicial reforms; (iii) effective implementation of laws \nand regulations; (iv) legal information system and legal dissemination; and (v) legal education, and judicial and \nlegal professional training. \n   ", "  3 \n9.  The SLSD-related work will support the systematic reform of legal systems and improve \ngovernance in general, and at the same time provide a better legal environment for businesses \nas well as citizens. An improved and easily accessible registry of secured transactions will help \nto achieve improved transparency, accountability, and predictability. The improvement, in turn, \nwill  attract  investors  and  help  small  as  well  as  big  businesses,  households  as  well  as \nenterprises, with improved credit terms and facilities.  \n \n10.  The expected major deliverables and outcomes are (i) implementation mechanisms for \nSLSD, including project document and implementation plan for selected priority projects; (ii) \nenhanced capacity of NRAST to provide registration services for secured transactions; (iii) four \nmore  POS  leading  to  increased  registration  facility  and  access  to  information  on  secured \ntransactions; (iv) increased public awareness of legal system reforms and development; and (v) \nincreased credit facilities and improved credit terms in the long run.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  Support to SLSD. Through international and domestic legal experts, the TA will assist \nthe PA project of MOJ in formulating implementation mechanisms for SLSD, with special focus \non selected priority projects in legal reform. The work will, among others, entail (i) identifying \nand developing projects in priority areas to be agreed upon with MOJ and (ii) conducting \nworkshops and seminars for consensus building and discussing the proposed project concept \nand implementation plans. The work will take into account JFM findings and recommendations, \nand formulate implementation mechanisms, as appropriate, in consultation with the LNA-Inter \nAgency Steering Committee and in close coordination with other aid agencies. \n \n12.  Drafting Ordinance. The TA will help prepare a draft ordinance or a higher level legal \ninstrument as necessary for the registration of secured transactions and broaden its scope to \ninclude immovable assets and other property. International experts will make recommendations \non the content of the draft ordinance, and they will coordinate with Vietnamese experts to \nprepare and complete the draft ordinance in close consultation with MOJ and the State Bank of \nViet Nam (SBV). MOJ will submit the draft ordinance to the Government for eventual approval \nby  the  National  Assembly  Steering  Committee.  MOJ  and  SBV  will  coordinate  the \nimplementation of the ordinance. \n \n13.  Capacity Building and Training.  The capacity building and training support under the \nTA covers four main areas: improving the organization and operation of the registration system \nof secured transactions; technical support to new registry offices; training in registering secured \ntransactions; and assisting in the public education and publicity program. First, the TA, with the \nhelp of international experts, will study the organization and process of registering secured \ntransactions in the Hanoi and HCMC offices and identify areas for improvement. Drawing on \nstudy findings and international good practices, the experts will make recommendations for \nbetter organization of registry operations for both movable and immovable assets, including and \ninformation and technology (IT) system for registration and also for public information. The \nrecommended modality will be used to improve registration work in existing as well as new \nregistry offices. The IT system in each registry will also be a step to achieving a centralized \nsystem by eventual linking each POS with the nation-wide computerized system.8 Second, the \nTA will assist NRAST in establishing pilot registry offices at four new sites in the country by \n                                                           \n8  The  computerization  program  is  expected  to  be  implemented  in  early  2003,  almost  in  parallel  with  the \nimplementation of the proposed TA.  \n   ", " 4  \n \nproviding technical support in putting in place a registry system and an IT system, and in \ntraining the required staff. \n \n14.  Third, the TA will assess the training needs of NRAST and its customers, and then \ndesign training curricula that cover both the concept and operation of secured transactions \nregistration. The training activities will be directed to trainers; NRAST staff, existing and new; \npotential institutional customers, including officials and experts from SBV, commercial banks, \ncredit  organizations,  finance  companies,  and  government  ministries  and  agencies.  Users \ntraining will be confined to the cities where registry offices are established. International experts \njointly with trained NRAST trainers will conduct the training workshops. They will also prepare \ntraining materials such as handbooks in hard copy as well as in CD-ROMs for self-learning \nthrough the web site. The NRAST trainers and experts will conduct similar training workshops in \nthe future, using these training materials to meet the future training requirements in all cities with \nPOS. \n \n15.  Fourth, international and domestic experts and NRAST staff in consultation with SBV \nstaff, will, among others, design public education and publicity (information package) at local \nlevels; develop a web site for NRAST for wider publicity and public education, and implement \nthe publicity programs. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $940,000 equivalent, of which $ 380,000 is the \nforeign exchange cost, and $560,000 equivalent is the local currency cost. The Government has \nrequested that the ADB finance $750,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign currency cost \nand $370,000 equivalent of the local currency cost (Appendix 1). The TA will be financed on a \ngrant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government will finance the balance of the local \ncurrency cost equivalent to $190,000 by providing counterpart support, office accommodation, \nbasic office equipment and supplies, local communication and transport, local information and \ndocuments required by the consultants.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  MOJ will be the Executing Agency. MOJ will appoint Project Directors, who will manage \nday-to-day activities related to SLSD and NRAST, and coordinate with other agencies and \nconcerned parties, particularly SBV.  \n \n18.  To support legal system development up to year 2010, four individual experts for a total \nof  21  person-months  will  be  engaged:  one  international  consultant  for  legal  system \ndevelopment, six person-months and three domestic consultants (a finance legal specialist; \nlegal specialist on transition, trade and integration and a legal education and training specialist), \neach with 5 person-months. To build capacity for secured transactions registration, international \nand domestic experts to provide 38 person-months services will be engaged through a firm \nusing the quality and cost-based selection method and simplified technical proposal. There will \nbe three international and ten domestic consultants; terms of reference are in Appendix 2. One \nthird of the TA resources (i.e $250,000) will be devoted to assisting MOJ in SLSD-related work; \nand the rest (i.e $500,000) to capacity building for secured transactions registration. The TA will \nbe implemented over 30 months. The ADB will engage consultants in accordance with its \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging \ndomestic consultants in consultation with MOJ. The consultants and implementing agencies (i.e \n   ", "  5 \nNRAST)  will  procure  equipment  required  under  the  TA  following  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement. Viet Nam Resident Mission working closely with OGC will implement the TA. \n \n19.  To effectively conclude the TA and to address the complex nature of the legal reform \nissues and the need for a forward-looking approach, both the Government and ADB have \nagreed to maintain some flexibility during implementation. MOJ will ensure timely provision and \nrelease of the necessary financial and human resources for setting up of registry offices in four \nnew  locations  in  the  country  and  provide  necessary  logistics  and  coordination  for \nimplementation. MOJ and ADB will regularly monitor and review the progress of implementation. \nAppendix 3 gives the TA framework. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $750,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Viet Nam for Legal System Development up to Year 2010 and Capacity \nBuilding for Secured Transactions Registration, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n   ", " 6 Appendix 1 \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n ($'000) \n \n  Foreign  Local  Total \nItem  Exchange  Currency  Cost \n     \nA.
