INTRODUCTION \n1.  This technical assistance (TA)1 will respond to a request by the Government of Bhutan \nfor additional support from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to strengthen its external audit \ninstitution,  the  Royal  Audit  Authority  (RAA).  The  TA  for  Strengthening  Audit  Resource \nManagement will build on ongoing ADB TA to improve public financial management in Bhutan \nand expand the RAA\u2019s capacity. The new TA is included in the Bhutan country operations \nbusiness plan (2011\u20132013).2 An ADB consultation mission visited Bhutan in September 2010 to \ndiscuss the details of the TA with the RAA. This resulted in agreement on the objectives, scope, \napproach,  financing  plan,  and  implementation  arrangements.  A  fact-finding  mission  in \nNovember 2010 reviewed and agreed on the design and monitoring framework and the terms of \nreference for consultants. \n \n2.  The  TA  supports  the  emphasis  in  Bhutan\u2019s  Tenth  Five-Year  Plan  (2008\u20132013)  on \nbuilding transparency and accountability in the country\u2019s institutions. The plan makes good \ngovernance a key development goal and the government sees the strengthening of the RAA \nand other accountability agencies as crucial to this strategy. The third pillar of the ADB country \npartnership strategy (CPS) for Bhutan is good governance.3 Rapid growth in Bhutan\u2019s economy, \nthe expansion of government expenditures that has resulted, and the government\u2019s continuing \nfiscal  decentralization  all  require  that  the  RAA  become  better  able  to  ensure  that  the \ngovernment\u2019s performance complies with its accountability criteria.   \n \n3.  ADB\u2019s ongoing TA has been improving audit resource management at the RAA.4 The \nnew TA will augment this effort by helping the RAA acquire and put information technology (IT) \nsystems to work to raise operational efficiency and improve in-house training. This strategic IT \nintervention will seek to  meet important needs in Bhutan for better governance and more \naccountability in government operations. Rapid growth combined with an aggressive pursuit of \ndemocratization and decentralization has widened an existing audit gap much faster than the \nRAA is able to fill it. The requested TA aims to address this key issue and help ensure that \nBhutan continues its steady progress toward its developmental goals.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Bhutan\u2019s economic growth during the past decade has been unprecedented. Its gross \nnational income per capita increased from $730 in 2000 to $1,900 in 2008. The incidence of \npoverty declined from 36.3% in 2000 to 23.2% in 2007 and the country is on track to reduce this \nrate to 15% by 2012\u20132013 under its Tenth Five-Year Plan (2008\u20132013). These are remarkable \naccomplishments by a country that was among the least developed in the world until 20 years \nago. Notably, economic progress has been achieved amid continuing political stability and a full \nopening of democratic space. Growth and change have not come without the usual challenges \nto good governance and sustainable economic development, however. \n  \n5.  The government has been at the forefront of the country\u2019s development and its activities \nand  expenditures  have  increased  sharply  along  with  expansion  in  the  economy  and  the \ntransformation of Bhutan\u2019s society and institutions. Seeking to ensure that growth reduces \npoverty and brings equitable socioeconomic development, the current five-year plan\u2019s emphasis \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 9 December 2010. \n2  ADB. 2010.

Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Bhutan for Strengthening Public Financial Management. \nManila (TA 7032-BHU). \n ", "2 \n \non good governance includes the goal of proper management and the best use of public \nresources to ensure administrative and financial efficiency, transparency, and accountability, \nand  to  improve  public  service  management  and  combat  the  spread  of  corruption.5 The \ngovernment made the RAA a constitutional body in 2005 to pursue these goals and established \nan  anticorruption  commission,  It  considers  the    strengthening  of  both  institutions  highly \nnecessary (footnote 5, p. 62) and believes this strengthening  requires the development of \nappropriate and effective IT and communications systems (footnote 5, p. 62). \n \n6.  The TA will seek to improve the RAA\u2019s ability to execute its mandate under the Audit Act \nof 2006 and to fulfill its enhanced  role under the Public Finance Act of 2007.6  The new \nconstitution adopted in 2008 directs the RAA \u201cto audit and report on the economy, efficiency, \nand  effectiveness  in the  use  of  public  resources.\u201d7 The  constitutional  requirement that the \ncentral  government  ensure  sufficient  intergovernmental  transfers  to  the  dzongkhags  (local \ngovernment districts) for them to operate in a decentralized setting heightens the demands on \nthe RAA due to the greater fiduciary risks inherent in fiscal decentralization. Decentralization is \nmeant to improve service delivery and accountability but it may initially increase the danger that \npublic resources will be wasted due to (i) growth in the number of civil servants with cashier \nfunctions and thus more opportunities for misappropriation of funds, and (ii) a decline in the \nquality of public expenditure management because of the limited skills of local officers.  \n \n7.  The RAA faces these difficult tasks even as it broadens its audit focus beyond financial \naudits to applying compliance and performance audits across a bureaucracy that is growing and \nbecoming more complex. It is also seeking to build its capacity to apply internationally accepted \nstandards of audit, a goal reinforced by in its membership in the International Organization of \nSupreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI). The RAA\u2019s request for additional ADB assistance to \nestablish IT innovations in its audit operations cycle and, by doing so, to rapidly equip its staff \nwith necessary tools, reflects its recognition of the need for it to scale up quickly to meet these \nchallenges.8 ADB\u2019s  earlier TA  conducted  a feasibility  study  of  commercially  available  audit \nmanagement software for the RAA but the cost of the system it recommended substantially \nexceeded the TA budget for IT procurement (footnote 4).  \n \n8.  The RAA conducted due diligence on the recommended software and concluded that \nmany of its functions were not relevant to its operations and more suited to the private sector. It \nconsidered  the  initial  outlay  very  high  and  the  annual  licensing  and  maintenance  fees \nunsustainable. Due to the proprietary nature of the software, the RAA also foresaw additional \nfuture costs if regulatory or operational changes required system modifications. This led the \nRAA to ask for additional ADB technical assistance to design a customized audit resource \nmanagement system to optimize its limited resources in the face of its increased responsibilities, \nas recommended by the earlier TA. Given the key role that an audit management information \nsystem can play in expanding and improving RAA  operations to ensure transparency and \naccountability in Bhutan\u2019s governance, ADB supports this request. \n \n                                                \n5   Royal Government of Bhutan. Tenth Five-Year Plan (2008\u20132013). Bhutan: Gross National Happiness Commission. \n(p. 51). \n6   The RAA adheres to the auditing standards of INTOSAI. These standards apply to the RAA\u2019s (i) basic postulates, \n(ii) general standards, (iii) field standards, and (iv) reporting standards. \n7   The Constitution of the Kingdom of Bhutan.  p. 58. http://www.constitution.bt/ \n8  The RAA has 10 officers with relevant training and experience in IT. Five of these officers have a bachelor\u2019s degree \nin computer science. Three officers have 2-year diplomas in IT and two have IT training certifications. The IT staff \nworked with an international consultant in designing and programming the RAA\u2019s audit information management \nsystem. ", "3 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact of the TA will be improved public financial management in Bhutan. This \nimpact will be measured by the reduced amount of unsettled funds in the total account of \ngovernment agencies as a percentage of the approved national budget. \n \n10.  The outcome of the TA will be increased accountability and transparency of public \naccounts. To measure this desired outcome, the TA will look for increased compliance of \naudited agencies with the recommendations of RAA annual audit reports. The TA will also \nmonitor the amount of unsettled funds of government agencies that are classified as caused by \nfraud and corruption to determine the achievement of targeted reductions. Finally, the TA will \nalso examine the reduction of total field audit time spent by RAA auditors. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  To  achieve  the  intended  impact  and  outcome,  the  TA  will  assist  the  RAA  in \nreengineering its business processes and developing and installing a customized audit resource \nmanagement information system. The TA will automate manual procedures, provide advice for \nimproved management of RAA operations, and equip auditors with more powerful tools to \nenhance operational efficiency and effectiveness.  \n \n12.  In the first year of the TA, ADB will help conduct business process reengineering, design \nthe basic features of the audit resource management information system (ARMIS), and procure \nthe necessary scalable hardware and software. In the second year, the TA will help pilot the \noperations of the ARMIS in the head office. Later, the RAA is expected to roll the ARMIS out to \nits regional offices on its own. \n \n13.  The TA will have three major outputs: (i) the reengineered business processes and audit \nprocedures of the RAA, (ii) a customized ARMIS designed and installed in the RAA, and (iii) the \ntraining of RAA auditors and relevant staff in the use of the ARMIS.  \n \n14.  The  TA  will  measure  these  outputs  by  (i)  the  acceptance  of  the  RAA  of  the \nrecommendations of the consulting firm\u2019s report regarding business process reengineering and \naudit  procedures,  (ii)  the  increase  in  the  number  of  RAA  computers  with  installed  audit \nmanagement software, (iii) the percentage of RAA staff trained in the new ARMIS, and (iv) the \npercentage of audits conducted using the ARMIS. \n \n15.  The RAA will field a dedicated IT team to work full time with the TA consultants to \nconduct a systems review and redesign of RAA audit operational policies and procedures. \nFollowing approval by the auditor general of streamlined policies and procedures, the RAA IT \nteam will be guided by the TA consultants in programming the new ARMIS. The TA will develop \nthe  appropriate  specifications  for  the  system\u2019s  hardware  and  software  and,  after  they  are \nprocured, install the ARMIS on a pilot basis at the RAA central office for performance and \nsecurity tests. Once a rigorous review and updating of the system is complete, the RAA will \nlaunch the system for use at its main office. The system will be rolled out to regional offices on a \nphased basis. \n \n16.  In terms of TA impact, the main assumption is that Bhutan\u2019s democratization continues \nto foster strong public interest in greater transparency and accountability in government. The TA \n ", "4 \n \nalso assumes that government support to deepen and mainstream good governance policies \nwill continue. The main risk to achieving the intended impact would arise from an external shock \nto the government\u2019s budget situation and a consequent reduction in the priority now accorded \naccountability reforms. \n \n17.  The TA makes two assumptions regarding outcome. The TA assumes that the RAA\u2019s \nuse of the ARMIS will enhance the quantity, quality, and credibility of its audit reports. As a \nresult,  the  reports  are  expected  to  improve  compliance  and  performance  of  government \nagencies. The TA also assumes that the public accounts committee and the anticorruption \ncommission  will  make  positive  use  of  the  RAA  annual  audit  reports  and  respond  to  its \nrecommendations, thereby elevating the risk of sanctions for violations and, through deterrence, \nenhancing compliance. The risk to attaining the expected outcome is possible resistance by \nactors in government opposed to accepting and implementing RAA recommendations. \n \n18.  With regard to outputs, the TA assumes that the installation of the ARMIS and the \ntraining in its application will lead to its effective use by the RAA. The main risk to this output is \nthat the designated RAA IT staff members will be unable to do their part due to other RAA \ndemands on their time. The RAA has assured ADB that this risk is understood and the auditor \ngeneral has said that regular work of IT staff members assigned to the TA will be suspended for \nits duration. To mitigate these risks, the TA will employ a pilot program prior to full launch of the \nsystem. \n  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n19.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $525,000. The government has requested that \nADB finance $450,000, which will be provided on a grant basis by the Technical Assistance \nSpecial  Fund  (TASF-IV).  The  government  will  finance  the  balance,  equivalent  to  $75,000, \nthrough the provision of office facilities, counterpart IT staff time, and various logistical and \nadministrative costs. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan is in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  The RAA will be both the executing agency and the implementing agency. The RAA will \nchair  a  project  steering  committee  that  will  include  the  public  accounts  committee,  the \nanticorruption  committee,  the  Department  of  Public  Accounts,  and  ADB.  Underscoring  the \nproject's priority, the auditor general has appointed the assistant auditor general to be the \nproject manager and to serve as the focal point of the project and principal liaison to ADB. The \nRAA will deploy eight IT staff members to the project to work full time, as needed. Five will come \nfrom the central office (one officer from the IT unit, and four officers from the IT audit section) \nand three from the regional offices. A project director will be chosen from this group to handle \nthe project\u2019s daily operations. Three staff members are expected to serve as systems analysts \nwhile the rest will serve as programmers.  \n \n21.  An international consulting firm will be contracted to implement the TA. The firm will be \nselected using the quality- and cost-based selection method with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20. \nInterested firms will be asked to submit simplified technical proposals. The selected firm will field \na senior systems analyst and programming specialist who will serve as the team leader of the \nproject (international, 10 person-months). He or she will lead an in-house RAA IT team to \nanalyze, design, program, and install the ARMIS. More specifically, the team leader will (i) \nselect and train the RAA IT team that will be responsible for the design and delivery of the \nARMIS, (ii) conduct a systems analysis of RAA operations and provide RAA with options on ", "5 \n \nhow the ARMIS can be designed, (iii) supervise and assist as needed in the programming of the \nARMIS, (iv) manage the piloting and testing of the ARMIS, (v) design a training curriculum and \nconduct  training for  trainers  in the  use  of  the  ARMIS,  and  (vi)  ensure that the  ARMIS  is \nlaunched successfully. The team leader will be assisted by a public sector audit specialist \n(international, 1 person-month) in the conduct of a business process review and systems design \nfor the RAA. \n \n22.  The team leader will also be assisted by a programming specialist (national, 10 person-\nmonths) who will provide technical support to the RAA team in the programming of the ARMIS. \nThe programming specialist will report to the team leader and will also help train the RAA team. \nBefore pilot testing the ARMIS, the firm will deploy an IT security specialist (international, 1 \nperson-month) who will test the integrity of the ARMIS and provide recommendations to improve \nits security features. These consultants will be recruited by ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The detailed terms of \nreference of the consultants are outlined in Appendix 3. Disbursement under the TA will be \nmade  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook  (2010,  as \namended from time to time). \n \n23.  The RAA will procure the basic hardware (servers, computers, scanners) and software \nfor the ARMIS. The procurement will be conducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). The specific details of the hardware to be \nprocured and the estimated cost will be determined during the systems design phase of the TA. \nAt the end of the TA, all equipment will be retained by RAA. Residual funds, if any, will be used \nto procure improved database and additional network connections. \n \n24.  The TA is expected to be implemented for 36 months from January 2011 to December \n2013. ADB and the RAA will develop a monitoring and evaluation plan based on the design and \nmonitoring framework. Data will be collected and analyzed regularly for the project\u2019s quarterly \nreports. Quarterly ADB missions will be conducted to review the progress of TA implementation. \nA technical assistance project completion report will be produced 1 year after the physical and \nfinancial closure of the project. \n \n25.  The RAA will disseminate the results of the design and development of the ARMIS at the \nannual  and  regional  meetings  of  INTOSAI  and  the  Asian  Organization  of  Supreme  Audit \nInstitutions. The project team will share lessons of the project in the South Asia seminar series \nand in other ADB forums as appropriate. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n26.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $450,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Bhutan for Strengthening Audit Resource Management, and hereby reports \nthis action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n \nData Sources and \nDesign  Performance Targets and  Reporting  Assumptions and Risks \nSummary  Indicators with Baselines  Mechanisms   \nImpact      Assumptions \n  Reduced amount of  Royal Audit   \nImproved public  unsettled funds in the total  Authority (RAA)  Bhutan\u2019s democratization \nfinancial  accounts of government  annual audit reports   continues to foster strong public \nmanagement in  agencies as a percentage    interest in greater transparency \nBhutan  of the approved national    and accountability in \nbudget at the time of    government. \ncirculation of draft RAA     \nannual audit report.
