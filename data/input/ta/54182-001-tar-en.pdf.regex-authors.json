The coronavirus outbreak  was  declared  a  public  health  emergency  of  international \nconcern by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 30 January 2020, and thereafter declared a \npandemic on 11 March 2020.1 The first cases were detected in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei \nProvince, the People\u2019s Republic of China. Since the beginning of March 2020, the number of \ncases outside of the People\u2019s Republic of China has grown thirteenfold, and the number of \ncountries impacted has tripled. The COVID-19 infection has spread to 213 countries, areas, or \nterritories, reaching 2,074,529 confirmed cases and 139,378 deaths within three months (as of 17 \nApril 2020).2 The first COVID-19 case reported in India on 30 January 2020 was a student \nreturning from Wuhan to Kerala. Since then it has continued to spread across the country. By 18 \nApril 2020, India has reported 16,115 confirmed cases, 2,301 cured and discharged cases, and \n519 deaths.3 \n2.  The COVID-19 outbreak has significantly added to the challenges affecting economic and \nsocial outcomes in the country. The 21-day nationwide lockdown from 25 March 2020 to contain \nthe outbreak has disrupted economic activities, adversely impacting businesses and livelihoods. \nThe economic disruptions have disproportionately affected poor and vulnerable populations as \nwell as the informal sector and self-employed workers, a vast majority of whom are women.  \n \n3.  The outbreak is not gender-neutral. Men and women\u2019s vulnerability to infection and \nmortality would vary, depending on access to healthcare services; experiences of quarantine and \nlockdown; experiences of loss of jobs, income and increasing food insecurity; indebtedness and \nthe experience of those just above the poverty line of being pushed back into the vicious cycle of \npoverty. Women health care workers face several specific challenges.   \n \n4.  Among other measures to manage the pandemic, the government has launched the \nCOVID-19 Response Program, which includes two key interventions: \n(i)  COVID-19 Response and Health Systems Preparedness Project of $2 billion to (a) \ncarry  out  emergency  responses  through  provision  of  personal  protective \nequipment,  enhanced  surveillance,  improved  health  facilities,  health  workers \ntraining, testing and tracking for containment of COVID-19; (b) strengthen national \nand state health system to support prevention and preparedness; (c) strengthen \npandemic  research;  and  (d)  enhance  risk  communication  and  community \nengagement.  \n(ii)  A pro-poor relief package of $23 billion under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan \nYojana (PMGKY) to provide temporary social security net for the low-income and \nvulnerable population, including women. It includes insurance cover to healthcare \nworkers, food subsidy, cash transfers to women and farmers and employment \nprotection.  More  precisely,  the  program  will  support  (i)  providing  free  health \ninsurance  for  all  levels  of  health  workers  to  recognize  their  sacrifice  and \ncontribution and providing funds from the district mineral funds for health-related \nexpenditures;  (ii)  measures  to  provide  social  assistance  for  compensating \n \n1   World Health Organization. 2020.

PMGKY will provide \nimmediate and direct support to the most vulnerable groups to the pandemic and \nthe national lockdown. The target beneficiaries include the poor, informal sector \nworkers, migrants, health workers, farmers, and women.  \n5.  The proposed COVID-19 Active Response and Expenditure Support (CARES) Program \nis a $1.5-billion budget support program. It will support the government in implementing the \ngovernment\u2019s COVID-19 response program (para. 4). The CARES program will target last mile \nbeneficiaries such as health workers, informal workers, particularly migrants in urban and peri-\nurban areas, women and other disadvantaged groups who require immediate support due to the \neconomic shocks from COVID-19.  \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n6.  India is facing formidable challenges in containing the social and economic loss amidst \nthe COVID-19 crisis. There is a need for swift and coordinated response to limit the effects on the \nvulnerable sections of the society. Further, institutional and policy reforms are also required to \nstrengthen  program  monitoring  and  implementation.  The  TA  will  develop  the  operational \nframework and strengthen the efficiency in targeting, delivery and monitoring and evaluation of \nthe  select  schemes  under  PMGKY.  For this, the  TA  will  build  new  or  strengthen  existing \ntechnological platforms or digital systems for select schemes for efficient targeting of existing \nbeneficiaries and COVID-19 induced new beneficiaries. It will support policy advice on further \neconomic restoration planning and scheme design, identification of affected people not covered \nin any of the sub-schemes (e.g., migrant workers), better incentives for certain category of people \n(e.g.,  construction  workers,  health  workers,  and  women  within  all  such  categories),  and \nknowledge sharing of other country\u2019s good practices for economic stimulus and health sector \nstrengthening interventions. For the health sector, the TA would extend support towards (i) \nstrengthening public health emergency contingency planning; (ii) strengthening institutional and \nstaff capacity in infectious disease control including community engagement; (iii) improving \nsurveillance  through  strengthening  an  integrated  health  information  system;  and  (iv) \nstrengthening innovations for effective prevention and response including behavioral changes. \nFurther, the TA will help the executing and implementing agencies build capacity for effective and \ngender responsive implementation. Capacity development is proposed as an associated TA \nbecause the tasks are specialized and require targeted, independent, and intensive inputs from \nhighly skilled specialists.  \n \n \n \n \n4  The pro-poor program will provide additional benefits to existing beneficiaries which are registered under each sub-\nprogram. These are categorized as the economically weakest section of the population and are most affected. The \nprogram will provide additional amount on top of the existing benefits. The attached TA will support the government \nin identifying COVID induced new beneficiaries which comprises of economically vulnerable section of the \npopulation. \n ", "3 \n \nB.

Cost and Financing \n \n8.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,094,000, of which $2,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-Others).

The  government  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of \ncounterpart staff, office space, workshop venues, office and logistics support, and other in-kind \ncontributions. The government was informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to \nfinance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n9.  ADB will administer the TA.

Another nodal officer will be designated at MOHFW to \ncoordinate health sector related TA activities. A national project coordinator will be engaged as \nan individual consultant to support the unit and do advanced works until the consulting firm is \nrecruited.
