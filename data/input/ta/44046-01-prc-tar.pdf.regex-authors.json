For two decades, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has supported the efforts of the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and Mongolia to participate in regional cooperation. ADB has \nalso supported PRC\u2013Mongolia cooperation since 2001 through technical assistance (TA) projects, \nincluding the TA for  Development of Regional Cooperation Programs for  Mongolia and  the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China,1 which was completed in April 2010. This regional policy and advisory \nTA is proposed in response to requests by the two governments for ADB to continue its support \nfor PRC\u2013Mongolia cooperation. The TA concept was cleared on 31 March 2010, and the proposal \nfor funding by the Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund was approved on 18 May 2010. \nThe  fact-finding  mission  visited  the  PRC  and  Mongolia  17\u201321  May  2010  to  discuss  with \ngovernment officials and other stakeholders the impact, outcome, outputs, and implementation \narrangements for the TA. Consultations were also conducted with the two governments during the \nin-country workshops on regional cooperation held in Beijing and Ulaanbaatar. Broad agreement \nwas  reached  on  the  key  aspects  of  the  TA,  and  support  was  obtained  for  its  design  and \nimplementation (Appendix 1).2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The PRC and Mongolia attach great importance to regional cooperation and integration \n(RCI). Both countries participate in various RCI initiatives, including the ADB-led Central Asia \nRegional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Program and the United Nations\u2013led Greater Tumen \nInitiative  and  Northeast  Asia  Economic  Cooperation  Forum.  The  PRC  country  partnership \nstrategy, 2008\u201320103 identified regional cooperation as one of the four key thrusts of ADB \nassistance,  whereby  ADB's  RCI  programs  will  be  used  to  enhance  regional  infrastructure \nconnectivity, facilitate cross-border trade and investment, and promote regional public goods. \nThe Mongolia country partnership strategy, 2010\u201320154 also treats regional cooperation as a \ncrosscutting theme. Regional cooperation is vital to Mongolia, a landlocked country, as it offers \nopportunities  to  strengthen  infrastructure  and  trade  links  with  its  neighbors,  diversify  its \neconomy, and realize its growth potential.  \n \n3.  The PRC and Mongolia share a border of about 4,600 kilometers. The two countries have \nstrong economic and trade complementarities. For more than a decade, the PRC has been \nMongolia\u2019s largest trading partner and investor. Bilateral trade has been growing quickly\u2014from \nless than $100 million in 1990 to $2.4 billion in 2009.5 About 65% of Mongolia\u2019s exports go to the \nPRC, while 35% of Mongolia\u2019s imports come from the PRC. The PRC is also the biggest source of \nforeign direct investment in Mongolia; total PRC investment in Mongolia reached about $1 billion \nby the end of 2009. However, PRC\u2013Mongolia trade and investment cooperation still faces various \nconstraints, mainly insufficient transport infrastructure and services, cumbersome customs and \nother border procedures, and lack of coordination in border-area (including free economic zone) \ndevelopment. Mongolia suffers more from these constraints, because its economy relies more \nheavily on external markets.  \n \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance for Development of Regional Cooperation Programs for Mongolia and the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China. Manila (TA 6370-REG). \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 5 May 2010.  \n3  ADB. 2008. Country Partnership Strategy: People's Republic of China, 2008\u20132010. Manila.   \n4  Mongolia\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2010\u20132015, is being developed and is expected to be finalized by \nDecember 2010. \n5  Despite the global financial crisis, trade between the PRC and Mongolia remained robust, with a decrease of only \n1.7% in 2009.  ", "2     \n4.  Mongolia\u2019s rich endowments of natural resources, particularly minerals, could not only \nsupply  the  PRC\u2019s  growing  demand,  but  also  serve  overseas  markets.  This  represents \ntremendous opportunities for Mongolia to accelerate its economic transformation and diversify \nits export markets. However, the transportation connections between Mongolia and the PRC are \nnot  adequate  to  exploit  the  full  economic  potential  of  these  resources.  The  PRC\u2019s  Inner \nMongolia Autonomous Region and northeastern provinces have invested massively in transport, \nparticularly since 2000. These investments have greatly alleviated the capacity constraints that \nwould otherwise have impeded Mongolia\u2019s access to markets in the PRC and beyond. However, \nlow physical capacity and insufficient investment continue to constrain the transport system in \nMongolia, especially in the central corridor (CAREC corridor 4b), which leads to the PRC via \nZamyn-Uud.6 The situation is exacerbated by slower-than-expected progress in implementing \nthe PRC\u2013Mongolia bilateral transport agreement and the absence of a PRC\u2013Mongolia\u2013Russian \nFederation tripartite transit transport agreement. The PRC\u2013Mongolia transport agreement is \nbeing amended and is expected to be signed in late 2010. The major amendments are expected \nto cover such key issues as opening new transport routes and expanding the exchange of traffic \nrights. Both countries will need technical assistance to implement the agreement. Negotiation of \nthe  tripartite  transit  agreement  began  in  2000  under  the  auspices  of  the  United  Nations \nConference on Trade and Development. It has not reached a conclusion, and the negotiations \non technical annexes  have yet to start. The PRC and Mongolia have  asked ADB to help \nrevitalize the negotiations.  \n \n5.  The  existing  cumbersome  and  ill-coordinated  cross-border  procedures  related  to \ncustoms, quarantine and inspection, transport inspection, and other border controls also impede \ntrade by causing long delays at the border, especially at Zamyn-Uud, which, together with the \nPRC\u2019s Erenhot (also known as Erlianhaote), serves as the gateway for PRC\u2013Mongolia trade \nand transit trade with Europe and the Russian Federation. The initial findings from the CAREC \ncorridor performance measurement and monitoring (CPMM) program indicate that a typical 500-\nkilometer cross-border journey by a 20-ton truck can take as long as 33 hours, 9 hours of which \nis for waiting and queuing, 4 hours for loading and unloading, and 2.5 hours for customs \nclearance in Zamyn-Uud.  \n \n6.  Another obstacle to trade is the uneven development in the border areas, particularly \nbetween Erenhot and Zamyn-Uud.7 To better harmonize border-area development, the local \nauthorities in Zamyn-Uud and Erenhot have set up a dialogue mechanism to address cross-\nborder issues. However, this ad hoc mechanism lacks planning and monitoring, and therefore \nneeds strengthening.  \n \n7.  The  PRC  and  Mongolia  have  used  the  opportunities  offered  by  RCI  programs  to \nenhance their bilateral cooperation. The CAREC regional cooperation strategy also endorses \nbilateral  initiatives  that  have  a  broader  regional  impact.8 The  PRC\u2013Mongolia  cooperation \nsupported by ADB has been implemented in line with the broader CAREC objectives and \nrelated sector strategies. However, it is tailored to the special priorities of the two countries and \nis carried out in a flexible manner to meet the countries\u2019 needs as they emerge. The original TA \n(footnote 1) supported a set of priority actions jointly identified by the PRC and Mongolia. Initial, \n                                                \n6  This issue is being addressed partly by ADB investments, including the Regional Road Development Project for \n$37.1 million, approved in 2004, with supplementary financing of $24 million, approved in March 2010. \n7  Zamyn-Uud has lagged far behind Erenhot in terms of developing urban infrastructure and trade logistics and \nborder-crossing point facilities, whereas the two border towns were roughly on par in the early 1990s.  \n8  ADB. 2004.  Regional  Cooperation  Strategy and  Program for  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation \n(CAREC) Member Countries (Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, People\u2019s Republic of China, \nTajikistan, Uzbekistan), 2005\u20132007. Manila. ", "  3 \nbut important, achievements have been made, particularly in transport and trade facilitation. Key \nactivities completed include a (i) study on harmonizing transport planning between the PRC and \nMongolia, (ii) study on harmonizing trade logistics and border-town infrastructure development \nin Erenhot and Zamyn-Uud, and (iii) pilot test of the PRC\u2013Mongolia joint customs control (JCC) \nat Erenhot and Zamyn-Uud through harmonization of cargo manifests for road transportation. \nThe original TA recommended steps to deepen PRC\u2013Mongolia cooperation that will need ADB\u2019s \ncontinued support. The key recommendations include (i) reviewing the JCC pilot and expanding \nJCC to other border-crossing points, (ii) enhancing PRC\u2013Mongolia transport cooperation by \nconcluding  and  implementing  the  amended  transport  agreement,  (iii)  further  harmonizing \nborder-area development by institutionalizing a dialogue mechanism at the key border cities of \nZamyn-Uud and Erenhot, and (iv) exploring cooperation in inspection and quarantine areas. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The impact will be the increased efficiency of trade between the PRC and Mongolia \nresulting from enhanced regional cooperation. The outcome will be deepened PRC\u2013Mongolia \ncooperation  in  the  priority  areas  of  customs,  quarantine,  transport,  and  border-area \ndevelopment; and experience sharing with other CAREC countries.  \n \n9.  The impact and outcome will be achieved through the delivery of the following outputs: \n(i)  Output 1: Deepened PRC\u2013Mongolia customs cooperation through \n(a)  review of the experience of the JCC pilot at Erenhot and Zamyn-Uud; \n(b)  replication of JCC at other selected border crossing points, with a special \nfocus on facilitating Mongolia\u2019s mineral exports;  \n(c)  development  of  cooperation  initiatives  in  other  areas,  including \nsimplification  of  customs  procedures,  data  exchange,  and  risk \nmanagement;  \n(d)  training for Mongolian customs at Shanghai Customs College; and \n(e)  promotion  of  JCC  experience  sharing  with  other  CAREC  countries, \nparticularly those that are also pilot-testing JCC.  \n(ii)  Output 2: Enhanced coordination in border-area development through \n(a)  establishment of a joint border-area development committee; \n(b)  cross-border dialogue for better planning and management of border-area \ndevelopment in Erenhot and Zamyn-Uud;  \n(c)  organization of public\u2013private sector dialogues and business forums to \naddress  private  sector  needs  and  develop  public\u2013private  partnership \nopportunities in Erenhot and Zamyn-Uud, particularly in trade logistics \nimprovement;  \n(d)  experience sharing on developing free economic zones; and  \n(e)  launch of a joint website to share information on PRC\u2013Mongolia trade and \ninvestment opportunities.  \n(iii)  Output 3: Enhanced PRC\u2013Mongolia transport cooperation through \n(a)  effective implementation of the amended PRC\u2013Mongolia bilateral road \ntransport agreement through progress review, experience sharing, and \ntraining, including producing operational user manuals;  \n(b)  enhanced PRC\u2013Mongolia policy dialogue in transport sector to further \nharmonize transport planning across the border and improve Mongolia\u2019s \naccess to seaports in the PRC; and  \n ", "4     \n(c)  recommendations  to  decision  makers  for  revitalizing  the  negotiation \nprocess of the tripartite transport agreement among the PRC, Mongolia, \nand the Russian Federation. \n(iv)  Output  4:  Establishment  of  a  mechanism  for  PRC\u2013Mongolia  dialogue  and \ncooperation in inspection and quarantine to address sanitary and phytosanitary \nissues and quality and standard issues, particularly those related to the trade of \nagricultural and meat products.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The TA will undertake the following activities: \n(i)  organizing meetings of the PRC\u2013Mongolia working group on JCC and workshops \nto review the progress of JCC pilots, and share experiences with other CAREC \ncountries, particularly Kazakhstan;  \n(ii)  organizing training at Shanghai Customs College for Mongolian (and Kazak) \ncustoms officers, particularly those from border customs houses, on selected \ncustoms cooperation topics; \n(iii)  organizing  consultations  to  help  the  PRC  and  Mongolia  establish  a  joint \ncommittee (and subcommittees, if necessary) for better coordination of border-\narea  development  in  Erenhot  and  Zamyn-Uud,  and  organizing  committee \nmeetings to strengthen cross-border dialogue;  \n(iv)  conducting training (including workshops and study tours) on free economic zone \ndevelopment for Mongolian officials, with a view to accelerating the development \nof such a zone at Zamyn-Uud;  \n(v)  organizing  public\u2013private  sector  dialogues  and  business  forums  to  address \nprivate sector needs and develop  public\u2013private partnership opportunities for \nborder-area development;  \n(vi)  establishing  a  joint  website  to  share  information  on  business  opportunities, \nbusiness operation, and training;  \n(vii)  organizing meetings, workshops, and other capacity building activities to support \nthe  implementation  of  the  PRC\u2013Mongolia  transport  agreement,  including \nproducing  operational  manuals  for  different  user  groups,  and  improving  the \nexisting PRC\u2013Mongolia transport dialogue mechanism to facilitate dialogue at the \ndecision-making level; \n(viii)  exploring ways to revitalize negotiations on the tripartite transit agreement among \nthe  PRC,  Mongolia,  and  the  Russian  Federation  with  the  United  Nations \nConference on Trade and Development and countries concerned;  \n(ix)  establishing a platform for dialogue and cooperation between inspection and \nquarantine agencies of the two countries to address sanitary and phytosanitary \nissues and quality and standard issues related to cross-border trade; and  \n(x)  organizing workshops for knowledge sharing with other CAREC countries. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $950,000 equivalent, of which $900,000 equivalent will be \nfinanced  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Regional  Cooperation  and  Integration  Fund9 under  the \nRegional Cooperation and Integration Financing Partnership Facility. The central and provincial \ngovernments of the PRC and Mongolia will each make in-kind contributions of about $25,000 \nequivalent by  providing  counterpart  staff; office  space;  support for  training,  seminars,  and \n                                                \n9  Established by ADB. ", "  5 \nconferences; and other administrative and logistical services. Details of the cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  About 12 person-months of international and 20 person-months of national consultant \nservices will be required to provide advisory and technical services under the TA. The consultants \nand resource persons will be specialists in integrated transport, trade, and investment facilitation; \ndevelopment planning and strategy formulation; private sector and business development; and \ninstitutional and capacity building. Because the TA will involve varied activities, consultants and \nresource  persons  will  be  selected  and  engaged  by  ADB  as  individuals  based  on  their \nqualifications and experience in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2010, as amended from time to time). Appendix 3 provides the outline terms of reference for \nconsultants and resource persons. Office equipment will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  will  be  transferred  to \nimplementing agencies upon TA completion. The TA proceeds will be disbursed in line with ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time).  \n \n13.  The TA will be implemented over 27 months (October 2010 to December 2012). ADB \nwill  be  the executing  agency.  The  implementing  agencies  will  be  the  transport  ministries, \ncustoms  administrations,  inspection  and  quarantine  agencies,  and  other  agencies  with \nresponsibilities for coordinated border management in the PRC and Mongolia. The ministries of \nfinance in the PRC and Mongolia will be responsible for overall guidance and coordination with \nthe respective domestic agencies, and will act as the main channel of communication with ADB. \nPrivate sector entities in the two countries, particularly in the border provinces concerned, will \nbe engaged. The Financial Sector, Public Management and Regional Cooperation Division of \nADB\u2019s East Asia Department will administer and implement the TA in collaboration with the \nCentral and West Asia Department and the PRC and Mongolia resident missions. Special \nattention will be paid to the potentially adverse impacts of trade facilitation and border-area \ndevelopment, particularly the risks of communicable disease and human and drug trafficking. \nLessons from other projects in the two countries10 will be applied in the implementation of this \nTA project. The monitoring of implementation progress and outcome will be carried out through \nperiodic reviews in accordance with the design and monitoring framework.  \n \n14.  The TA outputs, particularly the findings and recommendations from the key studies, will \nbe disseminated in the PRC and Mongolia and to other CAREC countries through workshops, \nseminars, conferences, publications, and the media. Where appropriate, representatives of the \nsecretariats of other regional cooperation bodies will be invited to dissemination events.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n15.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $900,000 on a grant basis for \nthe Development of Regional Cooperation Programs for Mongolia and the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (Phase 2), and hereby reports this action to the Board.   \n                                                \n10  ADB. 2004.
