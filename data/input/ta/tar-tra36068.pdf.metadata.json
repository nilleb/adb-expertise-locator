Based on an analysis of the limited existing data, regional technical assistance (TA) \n59071 from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) produced a first analysis of poverty in Pacific \ndeveloping member countries (PDMCs), and suggested broad poverty reduction strategies. The \nongoing  regional  TA  60022 is strengthening in-country  poverty  data  analyses,  participatory \nprocesses, and formulation of country strategies for poverty reduction in 4 of the 13 PDMCs: \nKiribati, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, Samoa, and Vanuatu. The progress of missions to \nreview regional TA 6002 (see footnote 2) and other related TA from April to June 2002, also \nformed fact-finding for further assistance. The new regional TA3 will extend this earlier work to \nfour  more  PDMCs.  At  the  request  of  the  PDMC  governments,  ADB  has  long  provided \nassistance in the preparation of national development strategies and has been at the forefront of \npromoting  the  incorporation  of  national  poverty  reduction  strategies  (NPRSs)  into  national \ndevelopment strategies.4 At ADB annual meetings and during country programming missions, \nPDMC governors have also requested ADB TA to help implement the ADB strategy for poverty \nreduction.5 TA goals, purpose, scope, are summarized in the TA framework (Appendix 1). \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Poverty has not previously been regarded by many stakeholders as a serious issue \namong the PDMCs, largely because most Pacific societies consider that traditional support \nmechanisms, which oblige people to share what they have with their families and communities, \nstill  hold  firm.  However,  poverty  is  becoming  an  increasing  problem  in  the  Pacific. The \nincidences of poverty recorded in some PDMCs6 all point to levels of poverty much higher than \nwas  previously  thought  to  be  the  case.  This  is  due  to  two  decades  of  weak  economic \nperformance and lack of job creation, fairly rapid population growth and urban drift, growing \ninequalities, and declining public services. Traditional support systems are under strain and are \nslowly breaking down. Moreover, in a broader definition of poverty, the Pacific islands suffer \nvulnerabilities due to political instabilities; their remoteness from major markets; geographic \nfragmentation; reliance on a narrow range of primary product exports, aid, and/ or remittances; \nand environmental vulnerability to natural disasters and rising sea levels. While there is poverty \nof access to essential public services, income poverty, and even malnutrition in some societies, \npoverty of opportunity is the most common description of the situation in the PDMCs. Traditional \n                                                                 \n1 ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance for Poverty Assessment in Pacific Developing Member Countries.

Fighting Poverty in Asia and the Pacific: The Poverty Reduction Strategy of the Asian Development \nBank. Manila. \n6 The poverty incidence is estimated at 39.5% in the Federated States of Micronesia (ADB. 1999.  Technical \nAssistance to the Federated States of Micronesia for Strengthening the National Statistical System. Manila), 41% \nin East Timor (ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance to East Timor for Formulating Strategies for Economic and Social \nDevelopment. Manila.), 48% in Samoa (United Nations Development Programme. 1999. Household Income and \nExpenditure Survey 1997: Food and Basic Needs Expenditure Survey. Samoa: UNDP), 50% in Kiribati (see \nfootnote 2), and 37.5% in PNG (World Bank. 1999.  Papua New Guinea: Poverty and Access to Public Services. \nWashington DC: The World Bank.). In Fiji Islands, members of the Poverty Task Force have estimated that the \nincidence of poverty has grown from 25% in 1990/91 to possibly 33% to 50% in March 2002. ", "2 \nland tenure regimes, other limits to competition, and an undeveloped wage labor force greatly \nrestrict domestic markets development and investment. As the private economy stagnates and \npublic sector performance declines, the opportunities for corruption increase and governance \nweakens. Ethnic conflicts have also exacerbated poverty in some PDMCs. \n \n3.  The nature and extent of poverty in the PDMCs remains insufficiently quantified and \nunderappreciated,  with  a  consequent  lack  of  ownership  and  commitment  to  implementing \nstrategies and priority programs directed at reducing poverty. Overcoming these constraints is \nan immediate need, if poverty is to be reduced in the region. Understanding, ownership, and \ncommitment  can  be  generated  through  better  assessment;  increased  awareness;  and \nparticipatory,  consultative  processes  with  government,  civil  society,  nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs) and international funding communities to raise the demand to reduce \npoverty. All stakeholders need to contribute to analyzing poverty and options for addressing it. \nThrough this participation,  greater  mutual  learning  will  take  place  and  a  greater  sense  of \nownership will be fostered. \n \n4.  The PDMCs are responsible for the assessment and definition of poverty, and for the \ndesign  and  implementation  of  their  NPRSs.  However,  PDMC  governments  lack  human \nresources and other capacity and they require assistance to develop capacities in the analysis \nand  qualified  assessment  of  poverty  and  the  formulation  of  country-owned  and  country-\ndesigned strategies. Given the extreme shortage in most PDMCs of professional statisticians \nand statistical data, especially of data relating to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), \nassistance is also required to monitor progress toward achieving the goals of poverty reduction. \n \n5.  Regional TA 5907 (footnote 1) demonstrated that poverty exists in varying degrees in all \nPDMCs. Under regional TA 5907 (footnote 1), preliminary but comprehensive strategies to \nreduce poverty were prepared for each PDMC based on deskwork in Manila. Under regional TA \n6002 (footnote 2), ADB assisted four PDMCs to analyze poverty, conduct participatory poverty \nassessments, and formulate country-owned poverty reduction strategies. The calculation, or \nrecalculation, of poverty lines under this and other ADB TA has particularly helped society and \ntheir  leadership  to  appreciate  the  extent  of  relative  hardship  or  poverty.  Concurrent \nconsultations and other participatory processes have also succeeded in developing broad \nunderstandings of the nature of poverty and a greater focus on priority programs.  \n \n6.  Analysis, assessment, and strategy formulation ultimately lead to agreement on new \nprograms of assistance, including assistance from ADB. ADB has signed Poverty Partnership \nAgreements (PPAs) with the governments of the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) and the \nRepublic of the Marshall Islands (RMI). Another four PPAs should be signed by the end of 2002, \nwith most of the rest to be signed in 2003. PPAs set out the process by which ADB and the \ngovernment will jointly assess the extent and nature of poverty and then develop an appropriate \npoverty reduction strategy, program of assistance, and MDG-related monitoring mechanism. \n \n7.  Complementary TAs in other PDMCs have improved understanding and assessment of \npoverty and the formulation of appropriate strategies. Under TA 3667,7 ADB has helped to offer \na people's understanding and voice on poverty in Papua New Guinea (PNG) to policy decision-\nmakers, and to incorporate this understanding in the new Medium-Term Development Strategy \nof the Government. TAs 34258 and 35129 (ongoing) have helped to quantify poverty and \n                                                                 \n7 ADB. 2001.

Small-scale TAs 362310 and 343211 are also \nhelping to quantify poverty by financing household income and expenditure surveys in Samoa \nand Tonga, and TA 325812 is helping analyze poverty in the Federated States of Micronesia \n(FSM). TA 378613 also supported poverty reduction strategy formulation in Kiribati. ADB TA and \nrelated activities of other donors to improve poverty assessment, understanding, and strategy \nformulation in PDMCs are detailed in Appendix 2, Tables A2.1 and A2.2. \n \n8.  Funders are actively seeking ways to further coordinate and cofinance their assistance \nto  reducing  poverty  in  the  Pacific.  The  World  Bank  is  collating  information  on  external \nassistance to poverty reduction in the region. ADB has taken the lead in considering the \nestablishment of a multidonor Pacific Poverty Fund for strategic analysis of poverty. The fund \nwill aim to pool external funds for more effective and efficient analysis of poverty.14 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n9.    The regional TA will continue and expand the work of earlier TAs. The ultimate goal of \nthe regional TA is to increase the impact of national development interventions in PDMCs in \nfavor of Pacific peoples who are disadvantaged, vulnerable, in the lowest income brackets, and \nmight  otherwise  be  considered  relatively  poor.  The  regional  TA  will  support  increased \nawareness  and  capacity  building  for  improved  assessment  and  understanding  of  poverty, \ndiscussion of poverty, formulation of NPRSs, their incorporation into national development \nstrategies,  the  finalization  of  PPAs,  the  establishment  of  poverty  reduction  MDG-related \nperformance indicators, and commitment to the implementation and monitoring of the same in \nselected PDMCs. This will facilitate actual delivery of poverty reduction measures that will have \nan impact at the community level. In particular the TA will continue the work of regional TA 6002 \n(footnote 2) by extending it to four more countries: FSM, Fiji Islands, Tonga, and Tuvalu. ADB \nhas already taken a lead role in poverty analysis and development strategy formulation in these \nfour countries. \n \n10.   Further work will also be required in other PDMCs and this will be the subject of another \nregional  TA.  This  work  will  mainly  concentrate  on  further  prioritization  of  strategies  and \nprograms and on strengthening monitoring and implementation of MDGs. This will likely be \nrequired in most PDMCs. For the Cook Islands, Nauru, and Solomon Islands, a framework for \nfurther TA is likely to be developed. \n \n                                                                 \n9 ADB. 2000.

", "4 \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The PDMCs face common problems and concerns with respect to reducing poverty. \nApproaches and methodologies that have succeeded under regional TA 6002 (footnote 2) are \nalso common and, while individual application and results will vary by country, common, shared \nfixed costs and synergies argue in favor of a regional approach. The regional TA will continue to \nadopt regional TA 6002 (footnote 2) approaches and methodologies. It will therefore incorporate \nthe following methodologies and key activities. Individual PDMC application will vary according \nto the particular status of development planning, planning capacities, and requirements in each \ncountry. \n \n(i)  At the beginning of the TA, a regional forum will be conducted. The forum will (a) \nshare experiences in the analysis, assessment, understanding, and formulation \nof NPRSs compiled thus far; (b) compare strategies to combat poverty; (c) \ncompare  monitorable  MDG  performance  indicators  and  the  best  means  to \nmonitor  and  evaluate  progress  in  the  implementation  of  poverty  reduction \nstrategies;  (d)  discuss  and  revise  the  proposed  TA  work  program;  and  (e) \notherwise discuss the  best means to institutionalizing an improved focus on \npoverty reduction in the PDMCs, including experience with the establishment of \nthe poverty task forces. PDMC representatives will make presentations to their \ncolleagues on these issues. \n \n(ii)  The establishment of poverty task forces, or their equivalent, will be aided in the \nfour PDMCs (FSM, Fiji Islands, Tonga, and Tuvalu); \n \n(iii)  Existing PDMC poverty analyses, assessments, understandings, and awareness \nwill be strengthened, including the calculation of poverty lines to develop people-\nfocused poverty analyses. This activity will utilize existing data where possible, \nbut will also assist the collection of new or additional data in, possibly, Fiji Islands \nand Tuvalu; \n \n(iv)  Capacity will be built for poverty analyses, incorporation of poverty reduction \nmeasures into national plans, and the implementation, monitoring, and evaluation \nof poverty reduction strategies. \n \n(v)  Concurrent participatory poverty assessments will be conducted to bring the \npeoples\u2019 understanding and opinions of poverty to prioritized country strategy \nand program formulation and policy decision-making. The results of this work will \nbe published in a booklet outlining the priorities of the poor for each country (as is \ncurrently under preparation for PNG, Samoa, and Vanuatu). \n \n(vi)  A series of poverty consultation workshops will be conducted in each of the four \nPDMCs, at national and community levels to help further identify prioritized and \nsequenced actions for reducing poverty. \n \n(vii)  Capacity-building training/workshops will be held to promote understanding of, \nand  improve  capacity  to  undertake,  PPA  among  government,  NGOs,  and \ncommunity  based  organizations  (particularly  community  women  and  youth \ngroups), to ensure continuity of the exercise after the completion of TA. \n ", "    5 \n(viii)  Based  on  enhanced  poverty  assessments,  improved  understanding,  and \nidentified priorities, focused NPRSs will be designed for each PDMC, and these \nwill be incorporated in national planning documents where appropriate. \n \n(ix)  MDG performance indicators will be identified and a poverty monitoring process \ndeveloped in each PDMC. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $500,000 equivalent and will be financed on a \ngrant basis from the Cooperation Fund in support of the Formulation and  Implementation of \nNational Poverty Reduction Strategies, through a channel financing facility administered by \nADB. Detailed cost estimates are provided in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  ADB will be the Executing Agency of the TA. PDMC government ministries of finance or \neconomic  planning,  or  departments  of  statistics,  will  act  as  the  in-country  implementing \nagencies, as relevant, in each selected country. The TA will take place over an estimated period \nof 12 months starting on 1 October 2002 and ending on 30 September 2003. The ministry of \nfinance or economic planning, or the department of statistics in each PDMC will provide in-\ncountry office space, administrative support, communications, and facilities for consultations \nand workshops. \n \n14.  The consultants will be engaged by ADB as individuals in accordance with its Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engagement of \ndomestic consultants. One international development economist with the sensitivity and proven \nability to communicate development understandings, priorities, and strategies will be recruited \non an intermittent basis for a total of 8 months. An international social analyst will also be \nrecruited  for  6  months  to  conduct  the  participatory  poverty  assessments.  Two  domestic \nconsultants will be recruited, based in Manila and/or resident missions, to provide research and \nadministrative support for the duration of the TA. Two facilitators will also be locally recruited to \nwork  with  the  international  consultants  in  each  of  the  four  PDMCs  (2  months  per  local \nfacilitator). Outline consultants' terms of reference and a tentative work program are provided in \nAppendix 4. \n \n15.  In-country designed NPRSs will be widely debated within each country as will their \nincorporation into national development strategies. The implementation of each NPRS will be \nmonitored during the annual country programming missions as part of the country performance \nassessment. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to be financed on a \ngrant basis from the  Cooperation Fund in support of the Formulation and Implementation of \nNational  Poverty  Reduction  Strategies  for  the  Preparation  of  National  Poverty  Reduction \nStrategies in Pacific Developing Member Countries, and hereby reports this action to the Board.
