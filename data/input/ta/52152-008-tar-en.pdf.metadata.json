The \nearthquake triggered a series of cascading events: a near-field tsunami, landslides, and major \nliquefaction.  The  National  Disaster  Mitigation  Agency  (BNPB)  identified  severe  damage  to \nhousing, infrastructure, and livelihoods, with the heaviest damage to housing, water supply, \nirrigation, roads, bridges, airport, and ports. Subsequently, the Ministry for National Development \nPlanning (BAPPENAS) prepared the Master Plan for Recovery and Reconstruction for Central \nSulawesi in December 2018 with the support of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the \nJapan  International  Cooperation  Agency.  As  an  immediate  response  to  the  disaster,  ADB \napproved the $500.00 million Emergency Assistance for Recovery and Rehabilitation from Recent \nDisasters on 20 November 2018.1 In addition, on 26 June 2019 ADB approved the Emergency \nAssistance for Rehabilitation and Reconstruction (EARR)2  in the amount of $297.75 million \ncomprising: (i) $188.00 million emergency assistance loan (EAL) supporting rehabilitation and \nreconstruction of water resources, water supply and education infrastructure,3 and (ii) $109.75 \nmillion EAL supporting reconstruction of transportation infrastructure.4  \n \n2.  The EAL covering transportation infrastructure has two outputs. The first output seeks to \n(i) rehabilitate the damaged ports in Pantoloan, Donggala, and Wani; (ii) restore and improve their \noperating capacity; and (iii) establish safety and emergency response plans for the rehabilitated \nports. The second output seeks to repair and/or reconstruct the runway, terminal building, and \nrelated infrastructure of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu and establish a safety and emergency \nresponse plan for the rehabilitated airport. Directorate General for Sea Transportation (DGST) is \nthe implementing agency for the first output while the Directorate General for Civil Aviation \n(DGCA) is the implementing agency for the second output. The Ministry of Transportation (MOT) \nacts as the executing agency.  \n \n3.  Following EARR\u2019s effectiveness on 4 November 2019, project implementation units have \nbeen established under DGST and DGCA, and recruitment for design and supervision consultants \nis underway. ADB had previously engaged a team of structural engineers, port operations experts, \nand project implementation and procurement consultants to assist MOT in accelerating the \nconsultant recruitment process.5 These consultants were also assisting DGST and state-owned \noperator (Pelindo IV) of Pantoloan port in updating the Palu Bay Port masterplan and facilitating \ndiscussions  between  DGST  and  Pelindo  IV  to  ensure  sustainability  of  operations  and \nmaintenance of the Pantoloan port. \n \n4.  Under the National Medium-Term Development Plan, 2020\u20132024 (RPJMN) 6, the priorities \nfor maritime connectivity are expected to include improving port infrastructure and operations, \nintegrating port development more closely with economic activities in the hinterland, reforming the \nport tariff regime, and introducing efficient shipping routes with larger vessels. Collectively, these \ninitiatives aim to reduce logistics costs, enhance competitiveness, and drive equitable growth \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2018.

Airport transport connectivity will also be a key focus area, with plans for \ndeveloping 25 new airports over the next 5 years. \n \n5.   Given the archipelagic nature of the country, planning, design, construction, operation \nand  financing  of  port  and  airport  assets  are  particularly  challenging.  Such  challenges  are \ncompounded by the fact that Indonesia is situated in the Pacific Ring of Fire, with 127 active \nvolcanoes and 80% of the country located in earthquake prone areas.7 Within MOT, there is \ngrowing  awareness  of  how  ports  and  airports  are  vulnerable  to  geophysical  and \nhydrometeorological hazards, and strengthening resilience is an important priority. For example, \nDGCA estimates that more than 70 airports are in proximity of hazard prone areas across \nIndonesia, and in 2019 issued decrees requiring formation of post-disaster quick response teams \nand preparation of disaster preparedness manuals.8 Even though there has not been a systematic \nassessment of hazards facing 636 ports listed under Indonesia\u2019s National Port Masterplan, DGST \nrecognizes that significant number of ports are vulnerable to natural hazards, and improving \nemergency preparedness is critical. This would require developing hazard specific emergency \npreparedness plans, strengthening linkage between port/airport operations and early warning \nsystems, conducting simulation exercises, and building staff capacity to manage disaster events. \nIn order to facilitate delivery of port and airport assets that are disaster and climate resilient under \nRPJMN 2020\u20132024, a tailored capacity building program is required for DGCA and DGST.   \n  \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SUBPROJECT \n  \nA.  Overall Progress of the Technical Assistance Cluster \n \n6.  The proposed transaction technical assistance (TA) is a subproject under the transaction \nTA cluster (C-TA 0040\u2013INO) Sustainable Infrastructure Assistance Program Phase II (SIAP2). \nSIAP2 was approved on 29 November 2018, with an expected completion date of 30 June 2024. \nSIAP2 provides (i) project preparation support to specific ensuing infrastructure projects listed in \nADB\u2019s current and future country operations business plans for Indonesia; (ii) implementation and \ncapacity-building  support  to  specific  ongoing  ADB-funded  infrastructure  projects;  and  (iii) \nknowledge and policy advisory support in the areas of infrastructure planning and financing, \ntogether with program management support for effective SIAP2 implementation.9 As of 20 \nJanuary 2020, total approvals are $13.00 million (43% of total funds), of which $0.06 million has \nbeen disbursed, and total available balance is $17.00 million.10 \n \nB.  Subproject Scope \n \n7.  The subproject will support implementation for the airport and ports component under \nEARR (footnote 2) and deliver capacity building program to accelerate the development and \nstrengthen the resilience of airports and ports as outlined in Table 1 below.  \n                                                \n7  World Bank. 2019.

These initiatives were partly \nthe result of DGCA\u2019s collaboration with the United Nations Development Program and DHL on the Get Airports Ready \nfor Disaster program that: (i) assessed disaster preparedness of 11 airports since 2009; (ii) provided training to more \nthan 300 staff from DGCA and airport operators; and (iii) resulted in preparation of disaster management plans for \nsome airports.  \n9  As of 20 January 2020, the following three subprojects have been approved under C-TA 0040\u2013INO:  (i) Knowledge \nand Support Technical Assistance for Innovative Infrastructure Financing, Infrastructure Planning, and Program \nManagement Support; (ii) Transaction Technical Assistance Facility for Supporting Sustainable and Efficient Energy \nPolicies and Investments; and (iii) Transaction Technical Assistance Facility for Supporting Sustainable and \nUniversal Electricity Access Phase 2.   \n10  Includes $5.63 million for ADB administration fees and contingency for foreign exchange losses. \n ", "5 \n \nC.
