INTRODUCTION \n1.  Impact evaluation1 at the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has so far occurred through \nthe individual efforts of departments, including impact assessments by regional departments \nand post-implementation evaluations by the Independent Evaluation Department. Despite these \nefforts, relatively few rigorous impact evaluations have been carried out on ADB projects.2 The \nproposed technical assistance (TA), in line with the managing for development results agenda, \nwill help mainstream impact evaluation at ADB. The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1.3 \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Bilateral  and  multilateral  development  agencies  spend  billions  of  dollars  each  year \nsupporting  development  programs,  and  developing  countries  spend  many  times  more  on \nprograms from their own resources.4 There is a substantial amount of empirical work on the \neffects of economic growth and human capital development on poverty reduction, for instance, \nbut little evidence on the development effectiveness of individual projects and programs. In \nparticular, questions often remain on whether a given intervention has produced its intended \nbenefits, and how efficiently that intervention has contributed to the intended outcomes and \nimpacts. Unless the evidence of project and program impact is available, it is not possible to \nadvise policymakers and development partners adequately on how further assistance can be \ndesigned  and  implemented  more  effectively.  ADB  lags  other  development  institutions  in \nintroducing programs to institutionalize impact evaluation analyses. \n  \n3.  Since its establishment, ADB has supported its developing member countries (DMCs) in \ndesigning,  financing,  and  implementing  project  and  policy  interventions  aimed  at  fostering \neconomic development and reducing poverty in the region. ADB's routine economic sector work, \ncost\u2013benefit analysis, and project performance monitoring, as well as project completion and \nself-evaluation exercises provide the basis for determining project outcomes and impacts before \n(ex ante) and after the project (ex post). The ex-ante analysis used at ADB for identifying causal \nlinks between development interventions, outcome, and impact is relatively comprehensive. \nMonitoring of implementation progress and processes, especially inputs and outputs, is also \ndone through a project performance reporting system. However, once projects are completed, \nthe ex-post assessment of the causal links between outputs, outcomes, and impact is often \nlimited by the absence of carefully constructed counterfactuals, which are needed to assess \nwhat would have happened to beneficiaries without the interventions. Often, evaluations at \nproject completion are conducted by monitoring partial indicators, and the focus on available, \nrather than needed, data may lead to selection bias. The lack of good counterfactuals and \nbaselines  also  leads  to  reliance  on  qualitative  assessments  and  identification  of  ADB \ncontribution rather than attribution, limiting the accountability for development outcomes.  \n                                                \n1  An impact evaluation assesses the changes in the well-being of individuals that can be attributed to a particular \nproject, program or policy. The central impact evaluation question is what would have happened to those receiving \nthe intervention if they had not received it. \n2  A common shortcoming of the impact evaluations was that they were not integrated into the project cycle and \nhence lacked sound baseline or benchmark scenarios. Other common shortcomings included weak analytical rigor \non account of insufficient sample size and/or choice of impact assessment techniques and methodologies. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 2 September 2010. \n4  The Center for Global Development, one of the world's leading policy research institutions, argues that despite \nspending billions of dollars on development-related interventions over decades, there is little knowledge or \nevidence about the impact of past development investments. See, for example, Birdsall, Levine, and Savedoff \n(2006) \"When will we ever learn? Improving lives through impact evaluation\", Center for Global Development \n<http://www.cgdev.org/section/initiatives/_active/evalgap>, and Banerjee and He (2007) \"Making Aid Work\", Boston \nReview/MIT Press. \n ", "2   \n4.  The Independent Evaluation Department evaluates projects after completion, but its \nability to carry out impact evaluations is limited by the lack of reliable counterfactuals and \nbaseline surveys. It is recognized that counterfactual identification and baseline surveys are \nbest started early in the project cycle, as part of the project monitoring and evaluation system, \nas they can be used to carry out impact evaluations at mid-term and project completion. Hence, \nimpact  evaluations  should  ideally  be  done  by  the  regional  departments  responsible  for \noperations.  \n \n5.  ADB recognizes the need to measure outcomes and impact more systematically as a \nway  of  strengthening  the  management  of  effective  development.  This  issue  was  also \nunderscored by member countries in general capital increase (GCI V) and Asian Development \nFund  (ADF  X)  discussions.  In  response,  ADB  has  initiated  actions  toward  upscaling  and \nmainstreaming impact evaluation.5 Better measurement of the outcome and impact of ADB \ninterventions will help the institution and DMC policymakers to assess the consequences of the \ndevelopment initiatives and help allocate limited resources more efficiently, guide the design of \nmore effective interventions, and enable evidence-based policy dialogue.  \n \n6.  Integrating impact evaluation into ADB operations requires additional resources. These \nare needed to initiate DMC awareness raising and capacity building, and to provide \u201cseed\u201d \nfunds to launch highly selective impact evaluations with the aim to promote and expand impact \nevaluation activities. All departments are expected to have a direct or indirect role in such an \ninitiative, but the main implementing role is recognized to lie with the regional departments, with \ntechnical support from the Economics and Research Department (ERD). Regional technical \nassistance was selected as the most suitable modality. Designing and implementing impact \nevaluation studies is a complex undertaking and not necessary or even feasible for every \nproject. The TA will design and implement (or initiate implementation of) impact evaluations of \nstrategically selected interventions so as to build the knowledge base required to sharpen \nADB's development effectiveness. The TA will be an important step toward implementing the \ninitial ADB Impact Evaluation Work Program (2009\u22122010).6 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n7.  Conducting impact evaluations for strategically selected interventions will improve the \nrelevance and effectiveness of country and regional partnership strategies. Stronger impact \nevaluations will lead to a more strategic mix of effective interventions. The TA will also help \ncreate regional knowledge on what kind of interventions work, how and why.  \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact of the TA will be for impact evaluation to be initiated and better integrated in \nADB-supported operations and DMCs. The outcome of the TA will be for impact evaluation to \nbe piloted in each regional department and related DMCs with an effective centralized technical \nsupport system.  \n                                                \n5  In May 2009, a heads of department meeting discussed the need to revive the impact evaluation initiative and \nestablished a steering committee to do so. In September 2009, the steering committee set up a cross-department \nworking group and endorsed a four-pronged program for upgrading impact evaluation at ADB: (i) advocacy and \ncapacity  building  of  ADB  staff  and  DMC  officials,  (ii)  support  of  impact  evaluation  initiatives  in  regional \ndepartments, (iii) conduct of impact evaluations, and (iv) knowledge sharing and learning. \n6  The Impact Evaluation Work Program (2009\u22122010) agreed by the heads of department on 30 September 2009 will \nbe updated to reflect the revised timeframe and the impact evaluation committee\u2019s arrangements incorporated in \nthis TA paper for Management approval. \n ", "  3 \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The outputs of the TA will include (i) at least five impact evaluation studies (one to two \nper regional department) with published case study illustrations;7 (ii) awareness building and \ncapacity  development  for  DMC  officials  and  ADB  staff,  and  awareness  building  for \nManagement; and (iii) technical support to regional departments in selecting and implementing \nimpact evaluation interventions. The TA will provide financial and technical support for these \ninterventions.  \n10.  The impact of a project is the difference between a specific outcome for the units \nreceiving the project intervention (e.g., individuals, households, and/or enterprises) and the \noutcome  that  would  have  resulted  had  the  units  never  received  the  project  intervention. \nAssessing the impact of a project requires comparing the units that receive the investments \nunder the project with the same units in a counterfactual scenario in which they do not receive \ninvestments under the project. \n11.  The central challenge of conducting impact evaluation studies is that a unit cannot both \nreceive and not receive the investments at the same time. Historically, this has been solved by \nmonitoring the same unit before and after the project, and measuring the project's impact by \ncontrasting outcomes for the same unit before and after, and with and without the project. The \nproblem with this approach is that as time elapses, other factors affecting the impact indicators \nmay appear. If a project has already been implemented, the measurement of outcomes could \nreflect not only the impact of the project (which is the main interest of project evaluators), but \nalso the impact of external factors that came to bear during implementation. As a consequence, \nthe difference between \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d might constitute a biased and inaccurate measure of \nthe project's true impact. \n12.  Therefore,  impact  evaluation  depends  on  the  construction  of  a  reliable  control \n(counterfactual) group to be compared with the treated group so as to ascertain a project\u2019s \neffectiveness. The control group should be composed of units that are not receiving investments \nunder the supported project but that resemble the treated units in every possible respect. If the \ncontrol group is different from the treated group in some important and perhaps hidden way, the \nevaluation of the project may be biased. The source of this bias, called the selection bias, would \nbe preexisting differences between treatment and control groups that influence how different \nunits will react to, and benefit from a given project. Modern impact evaluation techniques deal \nwith the task of generating reliable control groups, thus allowing the isolation of the treatment \neffect from the selection bias. Selecting the right methods by accessing external and internal \ntechnical expertise is expected to overcome the inherent methodological challenges of impact \nevaluation. \n13.  As a best-practice impact evaluation study ideally entails carrying out a baseline survey \nas well as an \u201cendline\u201d survey\u2014which will be done after the project has been completed\u2014the \nfull set of activities in a given evaluation may go beyond the timeframe of a single TA. To \nminimize this risk, impact evaluation is best incorporated into the project cycle, with strong \nsupport  from  DMC  governments  in  the  early  stages  of  the  project  cycle.8 An  alternative \n                                                \n7  Advisory support and training workshops under the TA will be supplemented by in-house training courses on \nimpact evaluation for ADB staff. \n8 The Government of Nepal has conveyed its concurrence with the impact, outcome, outputs, implementation \narrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference. Other DMCs to be covered by the TA will be \n ", "4   \napproach is to base the impact evaluation of an ongoing or recently completed project on non-\nrandomized techniques. Because the TA is the start of a process to integrate impact evaluation \nin  ADB-supported  operations,  yet  is  limited  to  a  2-year  implementation  period,  regional \ndepartments  will  prioritize  impact  evaluations  on  projects  that  are  known  to  have  credible \nbaselines, or carry out evaluations that use proxy comparators and non-randomized methods, \nbut support for the early stages of impact evaluations will also be considered where provisions \nhave been made in loan projects for systematic monitoring and evaluation, and endline surveys.  \n14.  Thus, the selection of impact evaluation subprojects will include the following criteria: \n(i) relevance of questions to be addressed by the proposed evaluation, (ii) effectiveness of the \nproposed evaluation design to learn policy lessons, (iii) adequacy of chosen methodology and \nalternatives,  (iv)  cost  effectiveness  of  the  proposed  study  design,  (v)  required  technical \nexpertise (in-house, external or local institutions), (vi) evaluation time needed, and (vii) buy-in of \nDMC  agencies.  Selection  will  be  based  on  the  information  provided  in  impact  evaluation \nproposals. Impact evaluations will be restricted to ADB project interventions, unless the impact \nevaluation committee makes an exception with sound justification. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The cost TA is estimated to cost $1.0 million and will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other), of which about $175,000 is budgeted \nfor each regional department and $125,000 for ERD, including contingencies. Actual allocations \nmay vary depending on the availability of useful secondary data, the design of the evaluation \n(e.g., single or multiple treatment groups), nature of interventions, required sample size to get \nsignificant statistical power, and required external expertise. The impact evaluation committee \nwill decide subproject budget allocations when reviewing impact evaluation design for quality \nassurance. \n16.  Subprojects, further in-house and DMC training, and awareness-building are expected to \ncost $0.875 million. The remaining $0.125 million will finance access to external expertise to \nsupport regional department and DMC evaluation teams, development and maintenance of an \nimpact evaluation intranet website, and dissemination and publication activities. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  To implement impact evaluation as part of the project cycle requires that the demand \nand responsibility for it will be with ADB\u2019s regional departments and their DMCs. Thus, ADB will \nbe the executing agency for the TA, and the regional departments will propose, prepare, and \nimplement impact evaluations under the TA on department-supported loan and TA projects in \ntheir DMCs, and in coordination with DMC counterpart agencies. ERD will provide overall \ncoordination  and  technical  support.  An  impact  evaluation  committee  comprising  ERD,  the \nRegional and Sustainable Development Department, the Central Operations Services Office, \nand  the  regional  departments,  and  chaired  by  a  regional  department,  will  have  oversight \nresponsibilities. The Independent Evaluation Department will be invited as an observer. \n18.  To  ensure  the  relevance  and  feasibility  of  each  impact  evaluation  subproject,  the \ncommittee will review and approve project proposals and budgets to be considered for impact \nevaluation from regional technical assistance funds. ERD and the committee will advise on \nproject design with support from external experts as required. Upon clearance by the committee, \n                                                                                                                                                       \nselected during implementation, and concurrences of relevant governments will be obtained before commencing \nwork in the particular DMC. \n ", "  5 \nthe regional departments\u2019 evaluation teams will seek endorsement from the DMC governments \non a non-objection basis, or a written confirmation to support the proposed design of the impact \nevaluation subproject. ERD will provide overall coordination of the TA budget and the committee \nwill approve TA budget allocations to the regional departments. These indicative amounts will \nbe flexible and transferrable between departments with committee approval.  \n19.  Once  an  individual  impact  evaluation  subproject  is  submitted  and  approved  by  the \ncommittee, the TA allocations will be registered with the Controller\u2019s Department and ERD. The \nregional department will administer the subproject and related contracts. The department will be \nresponsible for consultant selection and other budgeted items for the subproject. Although the \nexact requirements of the type of expertise and the length of their inputs will only be known \nduring the implementation of the individual studies, it is envisaged that the TA will require about \n18 person-months of international and 25 person-months of national consultant services. Given \nthis limitation and the intermittent nature of assignments and anticipated variety of expertise \nrequired, the TA will primarily fulfill its consulting requirements by recruiting experts on an \nindividual basis. If the studies require involvement of a research institution, the recruitment will \nbe based on the Consultants Qualification Selection (CQS). On an exceptional basis, and where \nthe subproject selections result in a country context where only one research institution can \nprovide the required expertise, the recruitment will be conducted on a single-source selection \n(SSS) basis. All consultants, individual and research institutions, will be engaged in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Outline \nterms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. \n20.  Procurement  of  equipment  (computer  hardware  and  software)  by  ADB  will  be  in \naccordance with its Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time) and in \ncoordination  with  ADB\u2019s  Office  of Information  Systems  and Technology,  and the Office of \nAdministrative Services. At TA completion, any equipment procured will be disposed off in \naccordance with project administration instructions.9  \n21.  Disbursements  under  the  TA  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). Payments will be endorsed by the regional \ndepartments to ERD for overall budget management and submission to the controllers. ERD will \nadminister TA funds for centralized expert advisory support. The departments will report the \nprogress of the evaluations to ERD and the committee. Based on department reporting, ERD \nwill provide overall reporting on TA budget utilization to the committee and controllers. \n22.  Regional departments will be responsible for the final subproject outputs and reports, \nand for quality. Results will be published as part of the project completion reports or as stand-\nalone working papers regardless of the nature of outcomes. The collection of data will be \nsupervised by the evaluation study team members and staff assigned by the committee to \nensure  their  quality.  The  data  produced  by  impact  evaluations  will  be  stored  and  made \naccessible for further internal and external use. \n \n                                                \n9  ADB. 2009.
