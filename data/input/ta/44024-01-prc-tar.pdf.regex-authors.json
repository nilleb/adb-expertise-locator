INTRODUCTION \n1.  During the country programming exercise conducted in December 2009, the Government of \nthe People's Republic of China (PRC) submitted a proposal to request technical assistance (TA) \nfrom  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  support  a  policy  study  on  strategic  options  for \nurbanization in the PRC1 as part of the government's effort to prepare the 12th Five-Year Plan \n(FYP) for Social and Economic Development 2011\u20132015. An ADB mission visited the PRC in \nMarch 2010 and reached an agreement with the government on all the major aspects of the TA \nincluding impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, \nand terms of reference for consulting service. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix \n1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The PRC has made significant progress in economic development since the adoption in \n1978 of the policy for reform and opening of the economy. Over the past 30 years, the economy \nhas grown at an annual average rate of more than 9%. The sustained growth in the PRC has been \naccompanied by rapid urbanization resulting from a continuing economic transformation and the \nincreasing importance of the economy\u2019s non-agriculture sectors. Cities have become the main \nengine for growth and employment. The number of cities increased from 176 in 1978 to 655 in \n2009. The urban population is expanding at increasing pace: it grew by an average of 10 million \nper year during the 1980s, by 15 million per year in the 1990s, and by 20 million per year since \n2001. However, despite the rapid growth of the urban population, the PRC\u2019s urbanization rate \nremains moderate (about 45.7% at the end of 2008), and is still below the average for middle-\nincome countries. The country\u2019s rapid urbanization is envisaged to continue, given the growth \nmomentum and ongoing economic transformation in the PRC. \n \n3.  Urbanization  in  the  PRC  results  from  economic  development,  and  has  established  a \nfoundation to sustain economic development under a set of new conditions. Rapid urbanization \nhas created new jobs in the manufacturing and service sectors and provided improved living \nconditions for millions of people, and played a significant role in promoting inclusive growth and \npoverty reduction. Rapid urbanization at such an unprecedented pace and scale has also imposed \nunique development challenges on the PRC. Urbanization is characterized by millions of rural \npeople moving into urban areas, rapid expansion of cities and towns (as measured both by urban \npopulation  and  urbanized  land  area),  and  an  explosive  increase  in  the  demand  for  urban \ninfrastructure and municipal services. The situation is compounded in the PRC by the dual public \nmanagement and social service provision established in the 1950s under the planned economy, \nwhich has effectively divided the population into two separate categories of rural population and \nurban population through the hukou system, i.e. the population registration system.   .    \n \n4.  Due to the lack of a national strategy, urbanization in the PRC remains largely a self-driven \nprocess taking place in hundreds of cities across the country. This process has been accompanied \nby the concerns of migrants in the cities who, due to their rural hukou status, do not have equal \naccess  to  public  social  services  provided  by  the  municipal  governments  for  urban  residents; \nuncontrolled urban expansion and loss of agricultural land; intensified frequency of disputes over \nland ownership as well as compensation issues and utility tariff increase;  uncoordinated and \nincoherent urban development among cities of different sizes and economic scales competing for \nlimited resources and opportunities; and associated ecological and environmental degradation. \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 27 April 2010.  \n ", "2   \nThe situation highlights the urgent need to develop a national strategy to guide the ongoing \nurbanization across the country.  \n \n5.  At the recently concluded National People's Congress in March 2010, the government once \nagain highlighted its commitment to promoting sustained, coherent, and integrated urbanization as \na  major  strategic  thrust  in  promoting  sustainable  development  in  the  PRC.  In  particular, \nurbanization is expected to play a special role in rebalancing economic growth by strengthening \ndomestic demand and economic transformation of the PRC, and building a more balanced and \ndiversified economy for sustainable development over the long term. \n \n6.  The FYP is the PRC\u2019s most important instrument in terms of setting a national strategy and \npolicy framework to guide social and economic development over a medium-term (5-year) planning \nperiod. The government is now in the process of preparing the 12th FYP for 2011\u20132015, which will \nbe presented to the National People's Congress for its consideration in March 2011. Past ADB TA \nprojects have supported various policy studies at national and sector levels\u2014including the Urban \nPoverty Study I and II, the Town-Based Urbanization Strategy Study, and the Study on Sustainable \nUrbanization in Metropolitan Regions2\u2014and thereby contributed to the development of previous \nFYPs.  For the first time, this TA project will directly involve ADB in the formulation of a nationwide \nstrategy as an integral part of the government\u2019s preparation of an FYP. \n \n7.  ADB's  country  partnership  strategy  for  the  PRC  has  highlighted  the  importance  of \nurbanization in promoting inclusive growth and balanced development and has specified that \"ADB \nwill directly support the sound and sustainable urban development needed to continue urbanizing \nand modernizing the economy\".3 With the TA, ADB will promote sound and sustainable urban \ndevelopment in the PRC through the provision of support for formulation of a national urbanization \nstrategy in the context of the 12th FYP, which will have a long-lasting and far-reaching impact on \nurbanization across the country. The TA will also help ADB clarify its own strategic operational \nfocus in the PRC\u2019s urban sector during the 12th FYP period, and form the basis for preparation of \nthe urban sector road map for the next country partnership strategy. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact of the TA will be sustained urbanization in the PRC under the guidance of a \nnational urbanization strategy formulated in the context of the 12th FYP. The impact of the TA will \nbe measured by the implementation status of the 12th FYP in terms of delivering the urban \ndevelopment strategy and the related policy and public intervention measures as outlined in the \nurbanization strategy. \n \n9.  The outcome of the TA will be an urban development strategy for the PRC that is suitable \nfor incorporation by the government in the 12th FYP to guide sustained urbanization in the PRC. \nThe outcome of the TA will be measured by whether the specific recommendations, proposed in \nthe form of a recommended urban development strategy, have been endorsed by the government \nfor consideration in formulating the 12th FYP. \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 1999.

The policy study on strategic options for urbanization in the PRC will focus on in-depth and \nsystematic analyses of three important urban development issues: (i) the projected pace and \nspatial distribution of urbanization in the PRC, (ii) the emerging urban structural pattern of the \nPRC\u2019s city system across the country, and (iii) the policy and institutional reforms and other \ninterventions needed to facilitate coherent, sustainable urban development in the PRC. Special \nattention will be given to the policy and institutional reforms needed to address the challenges \nassociated with the massive migration of people from rural to urban areas in terms of providing \nadequate  (i)  basic  infrastructure  such  as  housing,  social  and  municipal  services;  (ii)  public \nemployment services; and (iii) social security coverage for the fast-growing urban population. \n \n11.  The policy study will be conducted by an expert team comprising both international and \nnational consultants through review of international experiences and best practice, comparative \nanalyses of different options under different growth and urbanization scenarios for the PRC as a \nwhole and for its major economic zones, and survey and case studies. The TA will also include a \ncomponent for overseas study, which will allow the concerned officials in charge of economic \nplanning to have firsthand exposure to different urbanization models, international experiences and \nbest practices as part of capacity development for the government. \n \n12.  The outputs of the policy study will be presented in one general report and three theme \nreports as follows: \n \n(i)  General Report: Strategic Options for Urbanization in the PRC \n(ii)  Theme  Report  1:  Comparative  Analyses  of  Different  Growth  and  Urbanization \nScenarios for the PRC as a whole and for its Major Economic Zones \n(iii)  Theme Report 2: Comparative Analyses of Urban Structural Patterns on Different \nGeographic and Demographic Scenarios of Urbanization for the PRC as a whole \nand for its Major Economic Zones \n(iv)  Theme  Report  3:  Recommended  Policy  and  Institutional  Reforms  and  Public \nInterventions to Support Sustainable Urbanization in the PRC \n \n13.  The  policy  study  will  be  undertaken  collaboratively  by  the  government  and  ADB.  The \nfindings of the expert team will be jointly reviewed by the government and ADB at the international \nworkshops organized at each of the major TA implementation milestones (i.e., at TA inception, \nmidterm review, and wrap-up review), and these findings and views will be taken into consideration \nin preparation of the 12th FYP. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $750,000. The TA will be financed in an amount not \nexceeding $600,000 on a grant basis by ADB's Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF\u2013other \nsources).  The  government  will  finance  the  remaining  $150,000  equivalent  through  in-kind \ncontributions to cover the salary and per diem of its counterpart staff; coordination support for \nsurveys, case studies, and workshops and conferences; and access to the data and related \ndocuments required for the policy study. Detailed cost estimates and a financing plan are in \nAppendix 2. \n \n ", "4   \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) will be the executing agency \nfor the TA. The NDRC has designated the director general of the Department for Development \nPlanning as the project director to provide overall guidance for implementation of the TA. The day-\nto-day operation of the TA will be handled by the Urbanization Planning Division of the Department \nfor Development Planning. \n \n16.  The TA will field an expert team whose inputs include 5 person-months of international \nconsulting services and 27 person-months of national consulting services for the policy study. The \ninternational consulting services will include an international urbanization specialist (2 person-\nmonths), international social development specialist (2 person-months), and international urban \ngovernance  specialist  (1  person-month).  The  national  consulting  services  will  include  a  lead \nurbanization specialist (4 person-months), strategic planning specialist (3 person-months), regional \nplanning  specialist  (3  person-months),  urban  governance  specialist  (3  person-months),  social \ndevelopment specialist (3 person-months), transport development specialist (3 person-months), \nurban development specialist (2 person-months), environmental planning specialist (2 person-\nmonths), land policy specialist (2 person-months), and low-cost housing specialist (2 person-\nmonths).  \n \n17.  Given the importance accorded to the TA in preparation of the 12th FYP, the government \nhas requested that the policy study be led by a national consulting firm or research institution that \nhas sufficient experience and capacity to deliver high quality outputs relevant to and suitable for \nstrategy formulation and decision making. It is agreed that the input and service of each member \non the expert team will be coordinated by a lead national urbanization specialist who serves as the \nteam leader. All the consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The international consulting services will \nbe engaged by ADB on an individual basis, while the national consulting services will be engaged \nthrough a national consulting firm or research institution (i.e., a firm or institution established or \nincorporated in the PRC), using the quality- and cost-based selection method at a quality\u2013cost ratio \nof 90:10 through evaluation of biodata proposals. The outline terms of reference for consulting \nservices are in Appendix 3. All the disbursement under the TA will be done in accordance with \nADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook.4 \n \n18.  TA implementation will start in June 2010 and be completed by 30 June 2011. The TA \noutputs will be published in both English and Chinese.  \n \n19.  TA implementation will be subject to both ADB and PRC government project monitoring and \nevaluation  mechanisms.  In  addition  to  routine  monitoring  conducted  against  the  established \nimplementation  milestones,  TA  implementation  will  be  the  subject  of  review  missions  jointly \nconducted by the government and ADB. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n20.  The  President,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  by  the  Board,  has  approved  the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to the \nGovernment  of  the  People's  Republic  of  China  for  Policy  Study  on  Strategic  Options  for \nUrbanization, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2008.
