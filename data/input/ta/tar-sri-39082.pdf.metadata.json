It struck more than 1,000 kilometers, or two thirds, of Sri Lanka\u2019s coastline, \nstarting from Jaffna in the north, all of the eastern and southern coast, and part of the west \ncoast, as far as Chilaw, north of Colombo. As of 25 January 2005, official figures indicated that \n30,957 people were dead, 196 injured, and 35,644 missing, but the count is likely to increase. \nWith people returning to their homes or staying with their relatives, the number of displaced \npeople has fallen to 502,456; 1 million to 2 million out of a population of 19 million are affected \nby the disaster. About 200,000 have lost their livelihoods. The displaced are sheltered in some \n625 refugee camps, often temples and schools. Around 120,000 houses were damaged, of \nwhich more than 78,000 were completely destroyed. Coastal infrastructure (roads, railway, \npower, telecommunications, water supply, fishing ports) was significantly affected, but a precise \nassessment of the damage is ongoing. Given its concentration on the northern and eastern \ncoastal areas, the tsunami has affected a disproportionately high share of the poor who are \nengaged in fishing, subsistence agriculture, and small-scale trading activities. The burden of the \ndestruction wrought by the tsunami is not distributed evenly; vulnerable groups (the elderly and \nyoung, and women) are particularly prone to exploitation and abuse, especially in camps for \ninternally displaced persons. The human impact, in terms of lives lost and livelihoods and \nfamilies destroyed, has been staggering.  \n \n2.  In February 2005, the Government requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nprovide technical assistance (TA) for preparing emergency assistance, including refining the \ndamage  assessment  and  implementation  strategies.  ADB,  through  the  Sri  Lanka  Resident \nMission,  reached  an  understanding  with  the  Government  on  the  goals,  implementation \narrangements,  cost  estimates,  and  terms  of  reference  for  consultants  (as  outlined  in  the \ntechnical assistance framework in Appendix 1).1 \n \n3.  The tsunami has resulted in massive destruction of physical and social infrastructure \nthroughout the coastal areas (Appendix 2, Map). The Government, the Liberation Tigers of \nTamil Eelam (LTTE), and the donor community are coordinating in a post-tsunami recovery and \nreconstruction program to (i) meet the immediate requirements of people who have lost their \nhomes and livelihoods and help them resume their normal lives as quickly as possible; and (ii) \nto address the short- and medium-term rehabilitation needs of the tsunami-affected areas. \nADB\u2019s assistance will incorporate lessons learned from the post-conflict needs assessment2 \nconducted in 2003, mainly the continuing need for a balanced and transparent development in a \nconflict-sensitive manner\u2014the \u201cdo no harm approach\u201d\u2014given the urgent reconstruction needs. \n  \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  In a meeting of development partners on 29 December 2004, and with the Ministry of \nFinance on 30 December 2004, it was decided that ADB, the Japan Bank for International \nCooperation (JBIC), the World Bank, and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) \nwill support the Government in developing a joint needs assessment (JNA) to (i) assess the \ndamage inflicted by the tsunami, and to (ii) devise strategies on how to implement post-tsunami \nreconstruction programs. In the light of the Group of Seven (G7) meeting on 12 January 2005 \nthat gave the multilateral institutions the mandate to report on the state of the economy and \n                                                 \n1 In line with the flexibility granted by ADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy, listing in the ADB Business \nOpportunities is waived.  \n2  ADB, United Nations, World Bank. 2003. Assessment of Needs in the Conflict Affected Areas. Manila. \n ", "2   \ncosts of reconstruction before the next G7 meeting on 4 February 2005, a two-phased approach \ntoward the JNA was adopted.3 The first phase (9\u201331 January 2005) consisted of a report geared \nto G7 requirements, presenting restoration costs, and assessing the macroeconomic impact of \nthe tsunami. Total damage was estimated at 4.4% of gross domestic product (GDP), while \nrestoration costs in the short and medium term were projected at $1.5 billion.4  \n \n5.  The  second  phase  starting  early  February  will  last  for  6\u20138  weeks.  It  will  focus  on \nconsultations with all stakeholders, refinement of recovery and reconstruction strategies, and \nformulation of implementation strategies. While it is relatively straightforward to assess the \ndamage and to define what needs to be done, more work is needed to devise assistance to \nensure speedy, efficient, and transparent implementation. The finalized JNA can then become \nthe basis for donor coordination, including ADB, in funding further reconstruction operations, \nand  will  directly  feed  into  preparing  the  emergency  assistance  loan.  Interventions  will  be \nprioritized and supported either through joint cofinancing or parallel projects, depending on the \nmodalities available to interested donors.  For this TA, the following will be considered:  \n  \n(i)  Rehabilitation  under  ADB  assistance  will  include  elements  of  post-conflict \nrehabilitation identified by the needs assessment conducted in 2003.  \n(ii)  The second phase of the JNA should be undertaken jointly, reflecting the need to \nwork closely with the numerous Government ministries and agencies involved in \nrehabilitation, and with the representative organizations of the north and east. \n(iii)  The  area  to  be  covered  should  include  all  districts  affected  by  the  tsunami \n(Appendix 2) that are either under Government or LTTE control.  \n \n6.  The TA and the rehabilitation activities that may result from it will allow ADB to continue \nto play its important role in rehabilitation and donor coordination, and to develop other timely \ninterventions.  \n  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n7.  The TA\u2019s goal, purpose, and output are set out in the TA framework in Appendix 1. The \ngoal is to restore and improve basic living conditions for people affected by the tsunami in \ncoastal areas and for people affected by the conflict. The purpose is to prepare implementation \nstrategies for emergency assistance programs and to help finalize the JNA of rehabilitation \nneeds in the affected districts. Implementation strategies that can be used for the emergency \nassistance loan will be prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Assistance \nPolicy5 and related operational procedures and policies, and incorporate the Guiding Principles. \nThe Guiding Principles were prepared by the development partners in consultation with key \nstakeholders and the Government (Appendix 4). These principles stress the importance of \nconflict  sensitivity,  subsidiarity,  transparency  and  consultation,  as  well  as  coordination. \nSubsidiarity, or the delegation of program implementation and planning to the lowest possible \nlevel of government, is considered key to equitable and transparent implementation. These \nprinciples  are  envisaged  to  guide  all  development  cooperation  related  to  post-tsunami \nreconstruction. The output will be (i) implementation strategies for emergency assistance; (ii) \n                                                 \n3 The G7 is an informal grouping of finance ministers of the seven most industrialized nations who meet regularly on \nkey issues.  \n4 This estimate fed into the deliberations of the G7 on issues relating to debt restructuring of tsunami-affected \ncountries on 4 and 5 February 2005.  \n5  ADB. 2004.

This TA will support Sri Lanka\u2019s efforts to mobilize funding for a large-scale medium-term \nrehabilitation  program  in  the  tsunami-affected  areas,  and  help  crystallize  the  different \nadministrative and institutional arrangements for the successful implementation of livelihood \nrestoration in the north, east, and south.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  In planning the assistance, it is important to be sensitive to its geographical spread \namong the various affected areas and population groups, and to substantially involve key \nstakeholders such as high-level LTTE cadres in the North East. Given the importance of fast \nand efficient implementation of any post-tsunami reconstruction assistance, ADB\u2019s emergency \nassistance  will,  to  the  extent  possible,  make  use  of  existing  and  successful  project \nimplementation and delivery mechanisms through projects such as the North East Community \nRestoration and Development Project,7 Conflict-Affected Areas Rehabilitation Project,8 and the \nNorth East Coastal Community Development Project.9 Outside the North East, the Southern \nProvince Rural Economic Advancement Project,10 the Road Network Improvement Project,11 the \nCoastal  Resources  Management  Project,12  and  the  Rural  Finance  Development  Program13 \ncould be used as a platform to quickly deliver aid to affected areas.  \n \n10.  The TA will review existing assessments by the Government and LTTE. Extensive field \nvisits, including consultations with people affected by the conflict, will be conducted to verify \nprevious assessments and add new information. It will develop implementation arrangements \nfor a post-tsunami recovery strategy and identify gaps in the planning and/or implementation \nability  of  relevant  agencies  and  field  technical  assistants.  At  least  two  major  consultative \nworkshops will be held to discuss implementation strategies, in addition to smaller seminars and \nmeetings at the district level. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $550,000 equivalent, comprising $360,400 in \nforeign exchange and $189,600 equivalent in local currency expenditure.

The Government will finance the remaining \n$50,000 equivalent in local currency.14  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.  The TA will be administered by ADB. The TA will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s safeguards policy requirements specified in the Disaster and Emergency Assistance \nPolicy. The Executing Agency will be the Task Force for Rebuilding the Nation (TAFREN), \nwhich is tasked by the Government to develop the reconstruction program.15 The TA will fund \nother representative organizations in the North East. Responsibility and guidance to prepare the \nemergency  loan  lie  broadly  with  ADB  and  the  Government,  in  close  collaboration  with  all \nstakeholders. Inputs to the JNA will be mandated by the JNA steering group. To avoid overlaps \nin the field, field visits and surveys necessary to prepare the emergency assistance loan will be \na joint exercise where possible.   \n \n13.  The TA will be implemented over 12 months. It will include an element of retroactive \nfinancing of about $60,000, mainly related to the preparation of the first phase of the JNA, as it \nhas commenced in January 2005. It is expected to be completed by 31 December 2005. The \ninput of domestic consultants will be about 35 person-months and international consultants, 27 \nperson\u2013months  (Appendix  3).  Consultants  will  be  selected  on  a  direct  selection  basis  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy,16 and ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants by ADB and Its Borrowers.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n14.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to the Government \nof Sri Lanka to be financed on a grant basis from the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund for \nthe Sri Lanka Post-Tsunami Needs Assessment and Preparation for Emergency Assistance \nImplementation Strategies, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n                                                 \n14 The Government\u2019s share is 10% as considerable inputs (in kind and in consultants inputs) are also expected on a \ngrant basis from other development partners.  \n15 TAFREN is a new body under the President\u2019s Office, set up by the President of Sri Lanka in the wake of the \ntsunami, to steer and coordinate reconstruction efforts.

Schedule \n \n7.  It is anticipated that the consultants will mobilize around mid-January 2005 and complete \nthe assignment in mid-August 2005. Capacity building at the district and provincial levels will be \ndone around April 2005 and will remain, as needed, up to December 2005.  \n \nB.  Proposed Phase 2: Terms of Reference for the Joint Needs Assessment (Draft) \n \n8.  The objective of the JNA\u2019s second phase is to further develop and build consensus \naround a national reconstruction plan or similar document that embodies the concerns of all \nsegments of society and provides the basis for a concerted and successful reconstruction effort, \nconducive to long-term development and peaceful coexistence. The terms of reference for the \nproposed phase 2 of the needs assessment include, but are not limited to, the following: \n \n(i)  Obtain  and  assess  national  policies  pertaining  to  land  tenure/resettlement, \ncoastal development setback, fisheries development, procurement, cash-for-work \npayments,  business  recovery  mechanisms,  international  non-governmental \norganizations registration, and definition of tsunami-affected areas vs. conflict-\naffected areas. \n(ii)  Refine (as needed) the needs assessment at the sector level in consultation with \na broader range of stakeholders than was possible during the first phase (for \nexample,  through  additional  discussion  with  line  ministries,  civil-society \norganizations active in the sector, district representatives, affected populations). \n(iii)  Together with other stakeholders, develop concrete proposals and give advice on \nhow rehabilitation and reconstruction activities will be implemented, keeping in \nmind (a) the Guiding Principles (Appendix 4) developed jointly by development \npartners and accepted by the Government, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam \nand  Non-governmental  organizations  (represented  by  the  Consortium  of \nHumanitarian  Assistance,  etc.),  if  they  are  endorsed;  and  (b)  the  contextual \nconcerns highlighted during the first phase of the JNA. \n(iv)  Facilitate  the  development  of  standards  and  other  technical  aspects  of \nreconstruction activities that are consistent with international best practices by \nsupplying information to the authorities and parties so they can make informed \ndecisions on the most suitable solutions for Sri Lanka. \n(v)  Promote and carry out, in coordination and cooperation with the relevant parties\u2019 \nanalyses, assessment and planning at the local level to facilitate reconstruction \nactivities in a manner sensitive to the local situation. \n(vi)  Help  develop  a  consultation  process  that  will  ensure  that  the  proposed \nreconstruction activities are firmly grounded in local realities. In doing so, interact \nwith the central and local governments, civil society, and other stakeholders to \nensure  that  the  consultation  process  is  meaningful  but  feasible,  taking  into \naccount  that  (a)  time  is  short  before  reconstruction  activities  will  start,  (b) \ndisaster-affected people may be tired of meeting relief/reconstruction operators \nwithout seeing tangible benefits resulting from such visits and consultations, and \n(c) access to some affected areas is logistically difficult. \n ", "12  Appendix 4 \n(vii)  Facilitate the linkage of relief and reconstruction plans and activities (particularly \nin critical areas such as housing and livelihood) to ensure that the transition takes \nplace with minimum disruption and personal cost to the disaster-affected people. \n(viii)  Promote  coordination  of  external  and  domestic  assistance  (including  that \nsupplied by Government sources and NGOs) within the framework of the national \nreconstruction plan to maximize use of resources and create synergy in the \nassistance provided by different sources. \n \n9.  Deliverables. Frequent re-editing of the first phase of the JNA report is not likely to yield \nsignificant benefits. While adjustments should be made as necessary as a result of additional \nfindings,  the  focus  of  phase  2  will  be  on  (i)  identifying  and  documenting  approaches  for \nimplementing reconstruction and (ii) deepening the analysis at the local level. Deliverables will \ninclude the following: \n \n(i)  by mid-April at the latest, a report focusing on the modalities and approach to \ndelivering short and medium-term reconstruction and livelihood restoration; \n(ii)  by mid-April at the latest, a proposed plan to coordinate external assistance with \ndomestic resources to achieve the objectives of the national reconstruction plan, \nwith concrete indications of sector of activity for key development partners and, if \npossible, indicative amounts; \n(iii)  as  needed,  brief  notes  or  reports  on  specific  technical  issues  geared  to \npresenting the salient facts and options to the relevant decision makers; and \n(iv)  inputs into reconstruction planning activities at the local level. \n \n ", "  Appendix 5  13 \nGUIDING PRINCIPLES OF THE RECOVERY AND RECONSTRUCTION STRATEGY \n \n1.  As the key stakeholders, including the Government, the disaster-affected communities, \ndonor organizations (public and private), civil-society organizations, the Liberation Tigers of \nTamil Eelam and others begin to rebuild the shattered coastline, some critical aspects for the \nrecovery strategy must be recognized. The reconstruction strategy should thus be built on a set \nof guiding principles, drawing from international experience in disasters, and bearing in mind the \nspecial political circumstances of Sri Lanka. Such guiding principles, to be owned and adopted \nby the Government and all key stakeholders, include the following: \n \n2.  The recovery strategy should be conflict-sensitive, and at the very least do no harm to \nthe  peace  process  while  always  attempting  to  strengthen  it.  To  do  so,  the  allocation  of \nresources, domestic and international, should be strictly guided by the identified needs and local \npriorities,  without  discrimination  on  the  basis  of  political,  religious,  ethnic,  or  gender \nconsiderations.  Reconstruction  interventions  should  be  done  in  such  a  way  as  to  build \nconfidence between different actors in the process. Reconstruction should similarly be sensitive \nto the impact on neighboring but unaffected communities.  \n \n3.  The  strategy  should  be  based  on  the  principle  of  subsidiarity,  meaning  each \nreconstruction activity should be designed and implemented at the lowest competent tier of \nGovernment. While the central Government should play lead in setting standards, policies, and \nprinciples,  subsidiarity  allows  for  locally  appropriate  solutions  and  enables  a  range  of \nsubnational structures and organizations to channel funds. The recovery plan (which should be \ndisaggregated to the district level) would provide for capacity building and strengthening at \nvarious levels of governance, but especially district and Provincial Secretaries as well as local \ncivil-society organizations.   \n \n4.  The recovery strategy should focus on the medium- and long-term needs of the victims. \nTherefore, consultation with local disaster-affected communities and stakeholders is essential, \nand local communities should be empowered to make their own decisions during recovery, and \nparticipate fully in reconstruction activities. All interventions need to respond to clearly identified \nand articulated needs of local communities, respecting local religion, culture, structures, and \ncustoms.  This  is  especially  important  with  respect  to  the  policies  related  to  shelter  and \nrelocation, which should not proceed without such full consultation. Communities should be \nassisted to return to their original homes as swiftly as possible. To maximize the speed of \nrecovery, local capacities should be harnessed as far as possible.   \n \n5.  Communication and transparency are needed in decision making and implementation. \nMechanisms should ensure access to information on policies, entitlements, and implementation \nprocedures, and permit feedback to implementing authorities, as well as grievance redress. \nSimilarly, mechanisms to ensure transparency in resource use and comprehensive accounting \nneed to be created, at the aggregate, program, and beneficiary levels, accompanied by effective \nmonitoring and evaluation systems, to permit a full accounting to Parliament, development \npartners, civil society, and the disaster-affected communities of resources deployed from all \nsources. All parties will adopt a policy of zero tolerance for corruption in this joint effort. \n \n6.  Reconstruction  processes  should  reduce  future  vulnerabilities  to  natural  hazards, \nincluding floods, cyclones, and landslides. A multi-hazard risk approach should be used during \nthe recovery phase to ensure that communities and assets are less vulnerable to impacts of \nfuture disasters, while balancing the social costs of excessive resettlement.  The approach \n ", "14  Appendix 5 \nshould  be  guided  by  international  standards  and  best  practices  in  design  and  asset \nmanagement. \n \n7.  All the above considerations suggest a number of factors that need to be built into the \nanalysis of individual interventions. They should be analyzed for their potential impact on the \nconflict,  and,  for  long-term  sustainability,  such  interventions  should  also  incorporate \nconsiderations such as governance, gender-sensitivity, environment, resettlement/land issues, \nand human rights concerns. The process should be guided by international standards and best \npractice for protection, with special attention to the needs of vulnerable groups. \n \n8.  If debt relief is granted to Sri Lanka as part of the financing package, it would be \nespecially important to deploy the resources so released in a transparent way for the benefit of \nthe victims, and for such resource use to be carefully monitored.    \n \n9.  A coordinated approach is critical to ensure that the above principles are followed and to \nprevent  duplication  or  overlap  in  activities.  Development  partners  should  adopt  codes  of \nbehavior that will minimize the burden on overextended Government administration, not least by \nmaximizing their own coordination. Coordination should not just be between the Government \nand donors but involve all stakeholders, including civil society, the business community, and \ninternational NGOs, which have resources that will not pass through the Government. Local \ncapacity will need to be created for such coordination.   \n \n \n \nColombo, January 27, 2005 \n \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20050303105352+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20050218190059+08'00'", "Title": "Technical Assistance to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for Sri Lanka Post-Tsunami Needs Assessment and Preparation for Emergency Assistance Implementation Strategies (Financed by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund)", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 6.0 (Windows)", "Author": ""}}
