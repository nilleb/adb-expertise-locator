THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \npolicy-based grant to Nauru for the Fiscal Sustainability Reform Program.1 \n \n2.  The program aims to promote fiscal sustainability for Nauru. It builds on earlier reforms, \nsupported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other development partners, to improve \npublic financial management (PFM) and state-owned enterprise (SOE) performance, and to \nestablish the Nauru Intergenerational Trust Fund (NTF) to save unexpected gains, or windfalls, \nin public revenue for the future. \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Development context. Nauru is ADB\u2019s smallest member country and one of the most \nremote islands in the world. It is a single island of 21 square kilometers with a population of \nabout 10,800, concentrated along a narrow coastal belt. There is little potential for agriculture \nand the country is heavily dependent on imports for basic necessities. While Nauru possesses \ntwo  significant  natural  resources\u2014phosphate  deposits  and  the  oceanic  resources  of  its \nexclusive  economic  zone\u2014opportunities  for  diversification  are  limited.  Remoteness  and \ndiseconomies of scale translate into high operating costs, which limit opportunities for private \nenterprise and domestic job creation, and hamper efforts to deliver basic public services. The \npublic  sector  dominates  the  economy  and  employment.  Nauruan  institutions  are  thinly \nresourced  and  relatively  weak,  with  a  high  dependence  on  foreign  advisors.  Overall \ndevelopment progress has been mixed.2 Education and health outcomes have improved during \n2013\u20132015 but are still poor by international standards. An estimated 24% of the population \nlives below the basic needs poverty line.3 \n \n4.  Recent economic and fiscal performance. After suffering an economic collapse in the \nlate 1990s to early 2000s, Nauru\u2019s economy began to recover in 2007 and since then, the \ncountry\u2019s per capita income has recovered much lost ground. Gross national income per capita \nis estimated at A$15,641 (fiscal year [FY]2014). Phosphate exports resumed in 2007 and the \nRegional Processing Centre (RPC) for asylum seekers (operated under a bilateral agreement \nwith the Government of Australia) was reopened in 2012, having first operated during 2001\u2013\n2007. The RPC has contributed to a surge in local economic activity, domestic employment, and \ngovernment  revenues  (including  direct  payments  to  the  state  budget  under  a  bilateral \nagreement).4 Government  finances  have  also  benefited  from  windfall  fishing  license  fee \nrevenues (due to higher fee rates under a regional arrangement5), while payments to local \nlandowners for the liquidation of the Nauru Phosphate Royalties Trust (NPRT) since 2013 have \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Government of Nauru. 2012.

Nauru Hardship and Poverty Report: Analysis of the 2012/13 Household Income and \nExpenditure Survey. Unpublished. \n4  The bilateral agreement covers the period 2015\u20132019 with the possibility for a 5-year extension. \n5  Nauru receives and sells an annual allocation of fishing vessel days under the Vessel Day Scheme, operated under \nthe Parties to the Nauru Agreement, which comprises eight Pacific Island countries. Increased fees reflect high \nmarket demand while the scheme caps the supply of vessel days to protect the sustainability of regional fisheries.   \n ", "2 \nfurther added to aggregate demand.6 These positive developments raised economic growth to \n19.5% on average during FY2012\u2013FY2014, while domestic revenue tripled in nominal terms.  \n \n5.  The windfall revenue has been directed toward increased expenditure and improving the \ngovernment\u2019s balance sheet (Table 1).7 Personnel, goods and services, and special projects\u2014\nincluding  programs  for  school  feeding,  community  works,  and  community  housing\u2014have \nabsorbed the majority of increased spending. Fuel subsidy costs have been kept in check, with \nthe elimination of retail fuel subsidies in FY2015, but remain a large share of the budget due to \ncontinued fuel subsidies for the state-owned power company. The government has targeted \nbalanced budgets on a cash flow basis. Public debt has fallen 23.7% since FY2012. \n \n6.  In FY2015, damage to the port mooring facility, Nauru\u2019s main gateway for international \ncargo, caused real GDP to contract by an estimated 10.0%, with phosphate exports falling by \ntwo-thirds. The mooring system is structurally vulnerable to damage and has typically received \nonly ad hoc repairs. Inflation also jumped due to the disruption to inbound supplies coupled with \nstrong demand growth, the elimination of retail fuel subsidies, and a falling Australian dollar (the \nlocal currency). Despite these setbacks, Nauru\u2019s income remains at a high level by historical \nstandards and the economy is expected to recover strongly in FY2017 when the mooring \nsystem is expected to be fully restored.  \n   \nTable 1: Nauru Macro-Fiscal Performance and Outlook, FY2013\u2013FY2016 \nItem  FY2013  FY2014  FY2015 (e)  FY2016 (f) \nReal GDP (% change)  15.4  17.5  -10.0  3.0 \nInflation (%)  0.5  3.0  11.4  6.6 \nBudget balance (% of GDP)  0.3  2.3  0.1  0.1 \n  Adjusted balancea  12.6  20.3  10.5  12.6 \nTotal revenue ($ million)  59.8  87.4  95.6  82.2 \nSelected expenses (% of total revenue):         \n  Personnel costs   21.9  17.5  24.2  24.7 \n  Net fuel expensesb   16.4  8.1  9.2  8.2 \n  Debt repayments   14.6  22.7  5.2  2.1 \n  Goods and services (excl. fuel)  10.2  9.9  18.5  18.6 \n  Special projectsc   5.2  4.4  8.0  17.0 \n  NTF set-aside   0.0  5.4  4.3  9.0 \nNominal GDP ($ million)  114.3  130.4  118.0  111.6 \n(e) = estimate, (f) = forecast, FY = fiscal year, GDP = gross domestic product, NTF = Nauru Intergenerational Trust \nFund.  \na Budget balance, excluding financing items.  \nb Fuel purchases and fuel subsidies to a power utility, less fuel sales. \nc Special projects in the Government of Nauru chart of accounts plus the Community Housing Scheme. \nSource: Government of Nauru budget documents (various years) and Asian Development Bank staff estimates and \nprojections. \n \n7.  Government  development  strategy.  Nauru\u2019s  National  Sustainable  Development \nStrategy, 2005\u20132025 highlights the country\u2019s vision of \u201ca future where individual, community, \nbusiness  and  government  partnerships  contribute  to  a  sustainable  quality  of  life  for  all \n                                                \n6  The government began liquidating the NPRT in mid-2013 and has thus far made A$90 million in payments to \nNauruan landowners, the beneficiaries of remaining NPRT claims. The remaining NPRT assets could provide up to \na further A$30 million in liquidation payments. \n7  Economic and Fiscal Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "3 \nNauruans.\u201d8 The  current  government\u2019s  economic  reform  strategy  is  based  on the  National \nSustainable Development Strategy and focuses on achieving the long-term goals of (i) a stable, \ntrustworthy, fiscally responsible government; (ii) provision of enhanced social, infrastructure, \nand utility services; and (iii) development of an economy based on multiple sources of revenue. \n \n8.  Policy challenges. The overarching challenge facing Nauru is to effectively manage \nwindfall income to build a sustainable economic future. Nauru\u2019s heavy reliance on uncertain \nwindfall revenues (Table 2) gives rise to concerns about long-term sustainability, the quality of \npublic expenditure, and macroeconomic stability. RPC-related income remains highly uncertain, \nwhile collections from customs and excise duties and the new employment and services tax are \nalso sensitive to RPC-related developments. Fisheries and phosphate revenues face high short-\nrun volatility, and phosphate reserves are expected to be exhausted in the next 20 years. \n \nTable 2: Sources of Revenue Uncertainty \n(% of domestic revenuea, unless otherwise stated) \nItem   FY2015 (e)  FY2016 (f)  Issues \nFishing license fees  32.1  25.3  Short-run volatility, uncertain sustainability \nRPC-related payments  21.6  30.5  Short life span, risk of sudden cessation \nCustoms and excise duties  19.9  16.8  Sensitive to level of RPC activity  \nEmployment and services tax  6.0  10.1  Most taxpayers are linked to RPC \nPhosphate royalties and \n0.9  3.8  Short-run volatility, finite reserves \ndividends \nDomestic revenuea ($ millions)  73.2  68.1   \n(e) = estimate, (f) = forecast, FY = fiscal year, RPC = Regional Processing Centre. \na Net of fuel sales and reimbursable RPC-related costs. \nSource: Government of Nauru budget documents (various years) and Asian Development Bank staff estimates and \nassessment. \n \n9.  To achieve greater intergenerational equity and fiscal sustainability, a large portion of \nwindfall revenues need to be saved for the future. High inflation at present shows the limits to \neffectively  absorbing  significant  fiscal  expansion.  Acute  infrastructure  bottlenecks,  including \nNauru\u2019s inadequate and damaged port facilities and unreliable and inefficient power supply, are \na critical supply-side constraint. PFM deficiencies, particularly weak expenditure controls and \nproblematic cash management, further undermine the returns to scaled-up public spending. The \npotential for negative revenue shocks, both short-term and permanent, is also a major concern. \nNauru has no access to debt financing, which means careful fiscal planning within a medium-\nterm perspective is required to maintain adequate fiscal buffers. Broadening the revenue base \nto improve fiscal stability and sustainability is a priority.  \n \n10.  Public  financial  management.  In 2011, ADB technical assistance (TA) helped the \ngovernment to develop and adopt a PFM action plan to guide its reform efforts during 2011\u2013\n2015 and coordinate support from development partners.9 The action plan focused on achieving \na basic overall PFM system as soon as practically possible. Considerable progress has been \nmade,  including  (i) the  introduction  of  a fully automated financial management  information \nsystem  (FMIS),  Technology  One,  to  replace  the  existing  manual  system;  and  (ii)  the \nestablishment  of  a  public  procurement  policy  that  outsources  all  government  and  SOE \nprocurement for items over A$5,000 (except bulk fuel procurement, which has been privatized). \n                                                \n8  Government of Nauru. 2005.

Technical Assistance for Strengthening Governance and Accountability in Pacific Island Countries \n(Phase 2). Manila (TA 6499 REG). \n ", "4 \nThe government also undertook reforms to broaden the revenue base, including establishing \nthe Nauru Revenue Office in 2011, introducing a new revenue administration act in 2014, and \nadopting a new tax policy framework in 2014 which identified several new tax measures to be \nintroduced in stages over the coming years. While progress has been made on several fronts, a \nconsiderable  medium-term  agenda  remains.  In  the  near  term,  the  priority  is  to  further \noperationalize the FMIS, strengthen expenditure controls, improve cash management, move \ntoward medium-term budgeting, and introduce new revenue-raising measures. \n \n11.  Utilities  reform.  Subsidized  power  provision  is  a  major fiscal  burden,  while  power \nprovision remains unreliable and system efficiency remains low. 10  Weak management and the \nuse of outdated and inefficient diesel generators have been critical issues.11 Addressing this \nsituation  will  reduce  fiscal  costs,  strengthen  the  enabling  environment  for  private  sector \ndevelopment  and  government  operations,  and  improve  the  delivery  of  basic  services  to \nhouseholds. Recent reforms have helped to improve service delivery, and power outages are \nnow reported to be less frequent and generally scheduled. The Nauru Utilities Corporation \n(NUC) was corporatized in 2011 and a new chief executive officer was appointed in 2012 on a \nperformance-based contract. Power tariffs were also increased to better reflect economic cost. \nThese  reforms  need  to  be  deepened  and  built  upon  by  extending the  performance-based \nmanagement  system,  strengthening  financial  management,  and  ensuring  proper  asset \nmaintenance.12 Comprehensive  tariff  reform  to  move  toward  greater  cost  recovery  while \nbalancing equity concerns is also vital to sustainability. \n \n12.  Nauru  Intergenerational  Trust  Fund.  Large  windfall  revenues,  limited  scope  for \nsustained economic growth, and heavy dependence on development assistance suggest that a \ntrust fund arrangement can help in achieving a sustainable economic future. 13 As also happens \nin a number of other Pacific countries, such as Kiribati and Tuvalu, trust funds can play a major \nrole in economic stability and fiscal management. The government has sought to establish the \nNTF since 2009. While originally intended to provide a mechanism for saving and investing \nphosphate income for the long term, it has since become a critical necessity for saving broader \nand  much  larger  windfall  revenues,  including  those  from  the  RPC  and  fisheries.  The \ngovernment has also sought bilateral development partners to join the fund as contributing \nmembers to help build its principal value and ensure the fund is well governed. ADB TA has \nbeen helping to ensure the NTF is well designed to avoid the pitfalls of Nauru\u2019s experience with \nthe NPRT.14 Poor governance, weak management, lack of professional investment advice, and \nabsence  of  transparency  saw  the  NPRT  experience  severe  financial  losses  while  the \ngovernment simultaneously engaged in unsustainable borrowing against the fund\u2019s assets. \n \n13.  The NTF will be governed by a committee that includes the government and the original \ncontributing  governments. 15 The  NTF  itself  is  to  be  based  in  Australia  and  all  service \nproviders\u2014including the custodial bank, investment advisors, accountant, and auditor\u2014are to \nbe registered in Australia and subject to supervision and regulation from Australian regulatory \n                                                \n10  Sector Assessment (Summary): Energy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n11  An ADB project grant, with cofinancing from the European Union and Government of Australia, will finance two \nfuel-efficient generators.

Provisions such as restricting the type of investments that can be made (to be approved \nby the governing committee) and prohibiting any borrowing against the assets of the NTF are \nalso made to prevent other historical mistakes and abuses. The NTF will also be required to \nproduce audited financial statements and undergo regular performance reviews. \n \n14.  ADB\u2019s value addition, lessons learned, and program modality. The goals of the \nNational Sustainable Development Strategy are consistent with ADB\u2019s Interim Pacific Approach, \n2015 and ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2016\u20132018 for Nauru.16 ADB support is \nclosely aligned with the government\u2019s reform agenda and key policy challenges. ADB\u2019s 2012 \nPublic  Financial  Management  Reform  Program,  the  first  policy-based  operation  in  Nauru, \nsupported key reforms closely related to the proposed program, including the introduction of the \nFMIS; the establishment of a new public procurement system; the adoption of the new tax policy \nframework; and the undertaking of key reforms for SOEs, including the NUC.17 ADB TA has \nsupported the design and establishment of the NTF (footnote 14). ADB project assistance is \nproviding  new,  more  efficient  power  generators  for  the  NUC  and  ADB  TA  is  supporting \ninstitutional strengthening and tariff reform (footnote 12). Future ADB project assistance is \nfocusing on developing a new, more resilient and higher capacity port. ADB activities have been \nclosely coordinated with Nauru\u2019s other key development partners, notably the Pacific Financial \nTechnical  Assistance  Centre  and  the  Government  of  Australia.18 The  latter  also  provides \nsupport to improve the delivery of social services, a key complement to the program. \n \n15.  The policy matrix fully supports the government\u2019s policy agenda and is supported by all \nof Nauru\u2019s major development partners, including the Government of Australia. The policy \nactions are part of an ongoing reform agenda and policy dialogue between the government and \nits development partners, including ADB. The program has sought to incorporate lessons from \nADB\u2019s experience with policy-based lending in the Pacific, including (i) ensuring reforms are \npolitically  as  well  as  technically  feasible,  (ii)  avoiding  complexity  and  excessive  use  of \nconditionality, (iii) responding to reform opportunities, and (iv) combining TA with policy-based \noperations for complex and politically sensitive reforms.19  \n \n16.  ADB proposes a stand-alone policy-based operation that requires all policy actions to be \naccomplished before grant effectiveness. Disbursement will be conditional upon the opening of \nthe NTF account at a designated custodian bank based in Australia and after the government \nhas made its own initial contribution to the NTF account. In this way the program will help the \ngovernment to secure its full initial contribution to the NTF in the context of a tight fiscal situation. \nWhile there is broad political commitment in Nauru to having a trust fund, short-term political \nrealities  imply  that  contributions  to  the  NTF can  be  vulnerable  to  pressures for  increased \ngovernment spending. Demonstrating its commitment, the government has set aside funds for \nthe NTF in the FY2016 budget as well as the preceding two fiscal years. This amounts to \nA$20.4 million in total or 18% of estimated total revenue in FY2016. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n17.  The program impact will be an improved sustainable quality of life for all Nauruans. The \nprogram outcome will be improved fiscal sustainability. \n                                                \n16  ADB. 2015. Interim Pacific Approach, 2015. Manila.

Outputs \n \n18.  The program will consolidate and build upon earlier reforms supported by ADB in PFM, \nSOE performance, and fiscal policy management. The three outputs encompass nine policy \nactions, all of which have been accomplished.  The accomplishment of all policy actions are \nconditions to effectiveness. These are set out in the policy matrix (Appendix 4) along with future \nreform priorities that will be included in post-program monitoring. \n \n19.  Output 1: Improved public financial management. The program has supported the \ncontinuation of reforms begun in 2012 to improve budget execution and financial controls and to \nmobilize domestic revenue. Much progress has been made, but weak expenditure controls and \nproblematic cash management practices continue to undermine overall expenditure quality. \nWeak controls have constrained the ability of the Ministry of Finance (MOF) to ensure that funds \nare  spent  as  budgeted,  while  problematic  cash  management  has  undermined  operational \nefficiency and further distorted the pattern of public spending. The budget has also continued to \noperate  without  a  medium-term  perspective,  a  critical  weakness  given  the  uncertain  and \nvulnerable nature of Nauru\u2019s public finances. A medium-term fiscal framework is needed to help \nthe government achieve an appropriate balance between consumption spending, productive \ninvestment, and public saving for both the long and short term i.e., building a fiscal buffer \n(footnote 7). Following earlier revenue reforms, a nonresident employment and services tax is \nthe first new tax measure to be introduced as envisioned under the government\u2019s tax policy \nframework. \n \n20.  The MOF has implemented five policy actions under output 1: \n(i)  Output 1.1. The accounts payable and bank reconciliation functions of the FMIS \nwere made fully functional in October 2015 and March 2016 respectively. This allows \nthe government to minimize arrears in recurrent spending and advance accounts, \nand improve timeliness and completion of financial statements. \n(ii) Output 1.2. Quarterly financial progress reports were produced and submitted to the \nfinance minister in November 2015. This allows the government to improve financial \nreporting with commitments shown and minimize extrabudgetary expenditure. \n(iii) Output 1.3. Weekly in-year budget reports that include cash flow budget statements \nwere produced and made available to all ministries in February 2015, helping to \nreduce overexpenditure and improve cash flow forecasting and monitoring. \n(iv) Output 1.4. Aggregate revenue and expenditure projections for FY2016\u2013FY2018 \nwere  prepared  in  November  2015. These  allow  the  government  to  improve  the \nannual budget process and prepare multiyear budget forecasts that are linked to \nsector and infrastructure investment strategies. \n(v) Output 1.5. The Nonresident Employment and Services Tax Bill came into force in \nSeptember 2014. In FY2015 the tax is estimated to have generated A$5.4 million in \nrevenue. The FY2016 budget targets A$10.4 million in collections. \n \n21.  Output 2: Efficient service delivery by the Nauru Utilities Corporation. The program \nsupported the deepening of reforms at the NUC. The NUC was further commercialized through \nthe development of a business strategy and the extension of an integrated performance-based \nmanagement system for all staff. While NUC preventive maintenance practices have been \ninadequate, with maintenance carried out on an emergency or ad hoc basis, the situation has \nbeen improving since April 2014 with the appointment of a new generation manager, funded by \nthe Government of Australia. Financial management capabilities were strengthened through the \nintroduction of an FMIS. While an asset inventory was introduced, additional improvements \nwere required, particularly to integrate the fixed assets register with the fixed asset management \n ", "7 \nmodule under the NUC\u2019s new FMIS. The development of an asset maintenance plan will help \nfoster  improved  financial  and  operational  efficiency  and  will  be  important  as  the  NUC \nundertakes new capital investment, through an ADB project grant, to install additional, more \nefficient diesel generators (footnote 11). Effective financial information and costing for asset \nmaintenance will enable the government, with support from ADB TA, to develop an informed \napproach to planned tariff reform (footnote 12). \n \n22.  Two policy actions implemented by the NUC are supported under output 2: \n(i)  Output  2.1.  An  NUC  strategic  plan  was  developed  and  the  following  were \nimplemented: \n(a) A performance-based management system was applied to all employees, linking \nemployee performance to the achievement of the NUC business strategy. \n(b) Mind Your Own Business financial accounting software was introduced, which \ncaptures  all  transactions  and  records  them  under  the  appropriate  budget \nheadings, and produces timely and credible management reports. \n(c) A short-term program for asset rehabilitation was developed to upgrade the \nhigh-voltage power network. \n(ii) Output  2.2.  A  strategic  maintenance  plan  for  NUC  assets  was  developed  and \nadopted to provide for the maintenance and upgrade of NUC\u2019s power distribution \nnetwork, metering equipment, and water production and delivery. \n \n23.  Output 3: Improved funding mechanism for future service delivery. The program \nsupported the establishment of the NTF as a mechanism for saving windfall revenues. The NTF \nwas  established  through  the  signing  of  a  memorandum  of  understanding  between  the \ngovernments of Nauru and Australia. The specific purpose of the NTF is to build up a sufficient \nprincipal value\u2014through financial contributions and a long-term investment strategy\u2014that can \nprovide  a  future  stream  of  public  revenue  to  support  investments  in  education,  health, \nenvironment,  and  public  infrastructure.  The  intention  is  for  there  to  be  a  buildup  phase, \nprospectively to FY2033, before the NTF enters a distribution phase.20 Specific frameworks \nunder  the  NTF  agreement govern government  contributions  during the  buildup  phase  and \nmaximum  NTF  distributions  during  the  distribution  phase  (footnote  13).  Government \ncontributions will be based on realized domestic revenue in the preceding year, with the share \ncontributed  rising  with  revenue  levels  to  reflect  intergenerational  equity  principles.  Annual \ndistributions from the NTF will be determined by the committee but will be subject to a formula-\nbased maximum intended to help preserve the principle value of the fund in perpetuity. \n \n24.  The government has demonstrated its commitment by setting aside A$20.4 million as its \ninitial contribution to the NTF, including A$5.0 million each in FY2014 and FY2015, and A$10.4 \nmillion in FY2016. The Government of Australia has committed an initial contribution of A$5.0 \nmillion (inclusive of A$2.5 million cofinancing for the program) and intends to contribute up to \nA$2.5 million annually thereafter. The government is also in discussion with other bilateral \npartners to be contributing members. \n \n25.  The MOF implemented two policy actions under output 3: \n(i)  Output 3.1. A memorandum of understanding between the governments of Nauru \nand Australia to establish the NTF was signed in November 2015. \n(ii) Output 3.2. A budget allocation of A$20.4 million was made as the government\u2019s \ninitial contribution to the NTF, including A$10.4 million to be paid from FY2016 \n                                                \n20 The NTF committee will determine when the distribution phase is to begin based on the ability of the NTF to \nprovide a material amount of budget financing in perpetuity. A principal value of A$400 million is currently targeted.  \n ", "8 \nrevenues and A$10.0 million to be paid from cash set-asides from the two previous \nfinancial years. These set-asides are also a condition for disbursement. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n \n26.  The government has requested a grant not exceeding $2 million from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds  resources  to  help  finance  the  program.  The  government  has  also  requested  grant \ncofinancing from the Government of Australia equivalent to $1.8 million.21 \n \n27.  ADB is basing the size of its $2 million grant on Nauru\u2019s future service delivery financing \nneeds, which remain substantial, and the cost of its reform program, which amounted to around \n$3 million in 2013\u20132015. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n28.  Program  management.  The  MOF,  as  the  executing  agency,  has  overseen  timely \nimplementation of the agreed policy actions by the implementing agencies, and is responsible \nfor program administration, disbursements, and records maintenance. The MOF, through the \nDepartments of Treasury and Revenue, was the implementing agency for output 1, and through \nthe Departments of Planning and Aid, and Treasury, was the implementing agency for output 3. \nThe  NUC  implemented  output  2.  Ongoing  TA  projects  (footnotes  12  and  14)  helped  the \ngovernment fulfill program conditions. The program implementation period was from June 2014 \nto June 2016. \n \n29.  Tranches and disbursement. The grant will be provided in a single tranche. ADB will \ntransfer the grant proceeds directly into the account of the NTF held at a designated custodian \nbank based in Australia, immediately after the NTF account has been opened and after the \ngovernment has made its own initial contribution of A$20.4 million to the NTF. The government \nwill finance the local currency cost relating to the implementation of the program and other \nactivities consistent with the objectives of the program, and will provide the necessary budget \nappropriation to finance costs relating to the implementation of reforms under the program. The \nproceeds of the grant will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s simplification of disbursement \nprocedures and related requirements for policy-based grants.22 \n \n30.  The government will keep ADB informed of policy discussions with other multilateral and \nbilateral aid partners that may have implications for the program and will provide ADB with an \nopportunity to comment on any resulting policy proposals. The government will take ADB\u2019s \nviews into account before finalizing and implementing any such proposal. \n \n31.  Program performance monitoring and evaluation. The government will monitor the \nimplementation and outcome of the program using the set of indicators and targets in the design \nand monitoring framework agreed between the government and ADB. For each of the agreed \nindicators, progress will be measured against the baselines in the framework. The responsible \nimplementing agencies will support the review of agreed actions to determine progress and \nidentify constraints. ADB will provide policy dialogue and TA support to support post-program \nimplementation. \n \n                                                \n21  Funds will be deposited directly into the NTF bank account as outlined in Schedule 2 of the draft grant agreement. \n22 ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila. \n ", "9 \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n32.  The  program\u2019s  major  benefit  will  be  its  contribution  to  Nauru\u2019s  long-term  fiscal \nsustainability, which will in turn help maintain macroeconomic stability and ensure delivery of \nessential public services. These objectives are essential to inclusive economic growth in Nauru, \nwhile improving the environment for job creation and poverty reduction. \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n33.  Recent windfall revenues have greatly improved Nauru\u2019s fiscal position, which remains \ndependent on a narrow set of highly uncertain income streams that need careful management \nto avoid serious fiscal problems (footnote 7). During FY2012\u2013FY2014, a large share of windfall \nrevenue was used to improve the government\u2019s balance sheet. However, more recently, debt \nrepayments have slowed and the state budget has become increasingly reliant on vulnerable \nand unsustainable revenue streams. The reform measures included in the policy matrix will help \nto  address  these  issues.  An  economic  and  fiscal  assessment,  undertaken  by  ADB  staff, \nreplaces the IMF assessment letter as Nauru is not an IMF member (footnote 7).  \n \nB.  Governance \n \n34.  The  government\u2019s  ability  to  implement  its  budget  is  integral  to  the  success  of  the \nprogram. Gaps in financial controls and domestic resource mobilization have been minimized \nthrough the program (paras. 19\u201320). ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) \nwas explained to and discussed with the government. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary  measures  are  described  in  the  legal  documents. 23  Consistent  with  its \ncommitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to \ninvestigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive \npractices relating to the program. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n35.  The program will contribute to poverty alleviation by supporting sustainable, equitable, \nand inclusive long-term economic growth built on (i) improved PFM, (ii) better service delivery \nby the NUC, (iii) reduced subsidies to the NUC, (iv) increased domestic resource mobilization, \nand (v) saving of windfall revenues to fund future service delivery.24 \n \nD.  Safeguards \n \n36.  Program activities are confined to policy and institutional reforms, and none of the \nactivities will result in or lead to involuntary resettlement or affect indigenous peoples. No \nadverse environmental impacts have been identified. Safeguard categories for environment, \ninvoluntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples are all C. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n37.  The  program\u2019s  overall  risk  is  rated  medium.  The  key  risks  and  related  mitigating \nmeasures are summarized in Table 3. Fiduciary risks have been addressed through the PFM \nreform activities (paras.19\u201320). Risks and mitigating measures are described in detail in the risk \n                                                \n23  Grant Agreement (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nassessment and risk management plan.25 Integrated benefits and impacts are expected to \noutweigh the costs. \n \nTable 3: Key Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisk   Mitigating Measures \nPolitical consensus on reform is  The program was designed in close consultation with the government \nnot maintained  and requires government to make its full budgeted initial contribution \nto the NTF.

ASSURANCES \n \n38.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the program shall conform to \nall applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the grant \nagreement. The government has agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the program, which \nare set forth in the grant agreement. The grant will become effective after ADB is satisfied that \nall conditions for the release of the program tranche, as specified in the policy matrix and set out \nin Attachment 2 to Schedule 2 of the draft grant agreement, have been complied with to the \nsatisfaction of ADB. No withdrawals will be made from the grant account until the government \nhas established the NTF account at a designated custodian bank based in Australia and after \nthe government has made its own initial contribution to the NTF account. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n39.  I am satisfied that the proposed policy-based grant would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \ngrant of $2,000,000 to the Government of Nauru for the Fiscal Sustainability Reform Program, \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially \nin accordance with those set forth in the draft grant agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n                  Takehiko Nakao \n                  President \n \n29 February 2016 \n                                                \n25  Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "  Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact \nThe program is aligned with the goals and objectives of Nauru\u2019s National Sustainable Development Strategy, \n2005\u20132025, a which aims to improve the \u201csustainable quality of life for all Nauruans\u201d through the following: \n1.
