The Government has asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for project preparatory \ntechnical assistance (PPTA) to prepare the Vinh Tan 3 Thermal Power Project. The Fact-\nFinding Mission, which was fielded from 4\u201315 June 2007, held discussions with officials of the \nMinistry of Finance, the Ministry of Planning and Investment, the Ministry of Industry and Trade, \nthe State Bank of Viet Nam, and Electricity of Viet Nam (EVN) and visited project sites in Binh \nThuan Province. The Mission reached an understanding with the Government on the impact, \noutcome, outputs, cost estimates, implementation arrangements, and terms of reference for the \ntechnical assistance (TA).1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \nA.  Policy and Institutional Framework  \n2.  The Government\u2019s policy for the power sector, as enunciated in the Electricity Law, \nwhich came into effect in July 2005, is to develop a power market based on principles of \ntransparency and competition so as to (i) achieve economic efficiency, (ii) attract investments \nfrom both state and nonstate entities to the sector, and (iii) ensure the legitimate rights of \nconsumers and investors in the sector. The law declares that the state\u2019s monopoly in the sector \nwill be limited to power transmission, national load dispatch, and strategically important large \npower plants, leaving power distribution and nonstrategic power generation to potential private \nsector investors. Since the enactment of the Electricity Law, the Government has demonstrated \nits strong commitment to creating a transparent power market and to broadening ownership of \nthe sector by taking several key steps, including establishing the Electricity Regulatory Authority \nof  Viet  Nam,  approving  a  road  map  for  establishing  a  power  market,  and  approving  the \nestablishment of EVN based on a holding company structure.  \n  \n3.  The road map for establishing and developing an electricity market envisages a phased \napproach to reforms in the sector. During the first phase of development of the power market, \ncompetition  will  be  only  among  sellers  (power  plants),  and  a  single  buyer  will  act  as  an \nintermediary between the power plants and distribution companies. This single buyer will sell \nelectricity to distribution companies and large consumers at regulated prices. A pilot internal \npower market limited to EVN plants was initiated in January 2007 and the power market based \non the single buyer concept will start in 2009. The next phase of development of the power \nmarket, scheduled to start in 2014, will entail wholesale competition whereby sellers (power \nplants) and buyers (distributors and large consumers) will compete in a power market. The final \nstage  will  be  retail  competition,  whereby  retail  consumers  will  be  allowed  to  choose  their \nsupplier.  \n \n4.  The Government is restructuring EVN as a holding company. As part of this process, in \nApril 2007, the Government approved an equitization plan for 2007\u20132008 for equitizing most of \nthe operating units engaged in power generation and distribution. All existing power plants\u2014\nexcept the three multipurpose hydropower plants (Hoa Binh, Tri Anh, and Yaly)\u2014and the nine \nregional power distribution companies will be equitized during 2007\u20132008. The thermal power \nplants and the hydropower plants are grouped into separate companies for the purpose of \nequitization.  The  four  power  engineering  consulting  companies  belonging  to  EVN  and  the \nsubsidiary engaged in telecommunications services (EVN Telecom) will also be equitized. Prior \nto approval of this plan, two thermal power plants, a hydropower plant, and a provincial power \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 2 July 2007.  \n ", "2   \ndistribution company were equitized in 2006. Ongoing ADB assistance is providing strategic \nadvice  to  the  Government  and  to  the  Electricity  Regulatory  Authority  of  Viet  Nam  on \nrestructuring the sector.2 \n \nB.  Electricity Demand and Supply \n5.  Viet Nam\u2019s economy has been growing at about 7.5% per year over the past decade, \nwith gross domestic product growth reaching 8% in 2006. The Government is determined to \nmaintain economic growth at a level of 8\u20138.5% during 2006\u20132010, the period of the current 5-\nyear socioeconomic development plan. A reliable supply of electricity is critical to sustain this \nlevel of economic growth, as electricity is central to almost every aspect of socioeconomic \ndevelopment, including job creation, industry, commerce and business, and people\u2019s well-being. \nFollowing Viet Nam\u2019s accession to the World Trade Organization in 2007, investment by both \nforeign  and  domestic  entities  has  increased  substantially,  with  new  businesses  being \nestablished at an increasing rate. As a result, demand for power grew by 20% during the first \nquarter of 2007, and this growth will continue with the establishment of new special economic \nand industrial zones. Electricity demand is anticipated to continue to grow at about 16% per \nyear until 2011. As a result of this rapidly increasing demand, which is outpacing generation \ncapacity,  Viet  Nam  is  experiencing  power  outages,  and  these  will  increase  unless  new \ngeneration capacity is added quickly.  \n \n6.  Hydropower  plants  currently  account  for  about  40%  of  the  total  installed  power \ngenerating  capacity.  Given  the  rapid  growth  in  electricity  demand,  the  power  system  is \nexperiencing low reserves during the dry season, when hydropower plants can only operate at \nabout 40\u201350% of their rated output.Hence reserve capacities in the power system will be limited \n \nduring the dry season from 2007 to 2011. During this period, the south, which has gas-powered \npower plants, can supply power to make up for only some of the deficit in northern and central \nViet Nam(and at a higher transmission cost). Therefore, Viet Nam will have to import power \n \nfrom the People\u2019s Republic of China and the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic during the dry \nseason. By mid-2010, southern Viet Nam will start experiencing a shortfall of about 600 MW per \nyear in generating capacity, as power demand in the south is expected to grow by 10% per year.  \n \n7.  The Government has started development of the natural gas-fired O Mon Complex \nProject. Natural gas reserves are estimated at more than 400 billion cubic meters (m3). Gas \nproduction was about 6.5 billion m3 in 2005 and is expected to reach 15 billion m3 by 2010. \n   \nCurrently, gas production is concentrated in the Nam Con Son Basin, located on the southeast \ncoast. Almost all the gas produced has been committed for power generation in the Ba Ria and \nPhu My thermal power complex. The natural gas reserves from Cai Nuoc, and Block 46 fields \nare only sufficient to fuel the Ca Mau I (750 MW) and II (750 MW) combine cycle power plants in \nthe Mekong Delta in southern Viet Nam, which are currently under construction. Commission of \nthe Ca Mau I plant is expected in 2008 (testing of the gas turbine is ongoing), and commission \nof the Ca Mau II plant is expected in 2009. The proven reserves of natural gas from blocks B \nand 52 are sufficient to provide the 4.6 billion m3per year of natural gas required over 25 years \n \nto fuel the 2,850 MW O Mon power complex. However, construction of the O Mon power plants \nwithin the complex have been delayed because of protracted, ongoing discussions about gas \nprices with the investor.  \n \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Power Market Design. Manila (TA 4768-\nVIE, for $500,000, approved on 1 March). \n ", "  3\n8.  Viet Nam has a program to develop renewable energy to increase its contribution in the \nlong term. Development has focused on off-grid power supplies in isolated areas with small \nhydropower, solar and wind power facilities. Both the Ministry of Industry and Trade and EVN \nhave developed demand-side management and energy efficiency programs in recent years, and \ngiven  the  power  shortages  experienced  in  recent  years  and  continued  pressure  for  more \nelectricity service, the Government and EVN are moving to strengthen and accelerate these \nefforts.  Nevertheless,  project  developers  have  identified  access  to  debt  financing  for  both \nrenewable energy and energy efficiency investments as a constraint. ADB is working with \ndomestic financing institutions to address this issue through appropriately designed lending or \nguarantee products and policy interventions making use of the proposed Energy Efficiency Fund \nand Carbon Market Fund. \n \n9.  Given the foregoing, and to meet the growth in electricity demand, the prime minister \napproved the Sixth Power Development Master Plan (PDMP6) in July 2007 to include new coal-\nbased generation plants in central and southern Viet Nam, in addition to the natural gas-fired O \nMon Complex Project. Based on the revised PDMP6, EVN has prepared a list of new thermal \ngeneration capacity additions to the system between 2011 and 2015, including the Son My, Van \nPhong,  Vinh  Tan,  and  Vung  Ang  power  complexes.  All  these  power  plants  will  use  coal \nimported from Australia or Indonesia and will use super critical boiler technologies. As a result of \nthese projects, the share of coal in the generation mix will increase from 16% in 2006 to about \n34% in 2020, while the share of hydropower will fall from 37% in 2006 to about 27% in 2020. \nThe total installed generating capacity of thermal power plants will increase from 5,400 MW in \n2006 to 15,000 MW by 2020, making thermal generation a key source of base-load power \ngeneration.  \n \n10.  About $23 billion in investment is required for the power sector during 2007\u20132011. In \naddition to its own internal cash generation, EVN will have to mobilize financing from other \nsources,  including  commercial  borrowing,  bond  issuance,  private  sector  participation,  and \npublic-private sector partnerships, especially for generation projects. Development of the 4,000 \nMW  natural  gas-fired  Phu  My  complex,  in  which  ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector  Department  has \nparticipated  in  financing  two  plants,  is  an  example  of  a  successful  public-private  sector \npartnership. The Government recognizes the need for private sector participation in the power \nsector, and the private sector will develop the Son My 2 (1,200 MW) and Son My 3 (1,200 MW) \nthermal power plants within the Son My power complex. ADB is helping EVN finance the 1,000 \nMW Mong Duong 1 Thermal Power Project through its public sector operations, and at the \nsame time is assisting a private developer to finance the 1,200 MW Mong Duong 2 thermal \npower plant through its private sector operations. To meet the growing electricity demand, \ndevelopment of both O Mon gas power complex and Vinh Tan power complex is critical to \nensure an uninterrupted supply of electricity for central and southern Viet Nam.  \n \n11.  The Ministry of Industry and Trade has approved the preliminary feasibility study for the \nVinh Tan power complex, the first coal-fired power plant in the south. The Vinh Tan power \ncomplex is planned to have a capacity of 4,400 MW, to be developed in three phases: Vinh Tan \n1 (2 x 600 MW), Vinh Tan 2 (2 x 600 MW), and Vinh Tan 3 (2 x 1,000 MW). A joint venture by \nthe  Viet  Nam  National  Coal-Mineral  Industries  Group  (29%);  the  China  Power  Investment \nDevelopment Corporation, Hong Kong, China (30%); and the China Southern Grid (41%) is \ndeveloping Vinh Tan 1. Vinh Tan 1 is scheduled for commissioning by the end of 2010. EVN will \nfinance  Vinh  Tan  2  in  2008  for  commissioning  by  2011  and  has  asked  ADB  to  consider \nfinancing Vinh Tan 3 in two phases. The first phase, the Vinh Tan 3.1 (1,000 MW) power plant \nwould be financed by ADB in 2008 for commissioning in 2012, and the second phase, the Vinh \nTan 3.2 (1,000 MW) power plant, would be financed in 2009 for commissioning in 2013. \n ", "4   \n12.  The proposed Vinh Tan 3 power plant is consistent with ADB\u2019s country strategy and \noperational priorities in Viet Nam. The power sector is identified as one of the key infrastructure \nsectors that require urgent assistance in the 2007\u20132010 country strategy and program for Viet \nNam3 to avert a power crisis that may impede private sector investment in the country, a \nsituation  that  will  worsen  if  not  addressed  quickly.  ADB  will  focus  its  future  power  sector \ninvestments in Viet Nam on generation and transmission through public-private partnerships, \nwhile EVN, with support from the World Bank, will finance the required distribution system. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The main purpose of the PPTA is to undertake the technical, economic, financial, social, \nand environmental study required to develop the Vinh Tan 3 Thermal Power Plant Project, to be \nfinanced by ADB in two phases.  \n \n14.  The key outcomes of the TA include (i) confirming that the Vinh Tan 3 Project is the \nleast-cost option for power generation as indicated in the PDMP6 and that it is economically and \nfinancially  viable;  (ii)  defining  the  project\u2019s  scope,  cost  estimate,  and  financing  plan;  (iii) \nundertaking environmental and social impact assessment for the Vinh Tan power complex as a \nwhole and ensuring that the power complex complies with national environmental emission \nstandards and international best practices, such as those cited in the Pollution Prevention and \nAbatement Handbook;4 (iv) finalizing the environmental management plans and resettlement \nplan for the Vinh Tan 3 power complex; and (v) preparing detailed cost estimates and details of \nthe  scope  of  work  for  engineering  consulting  services  to  be  provided  during  project \nimplementation.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n15.  The TA consultants will review the prefeasibility and technical studies for the Vinh Tan 3 \nProject and undertake the necessary analysis, bearing in mind the load growth prospects, the \nfuel mix, demand side-management and the resource constraints. In particular, the consultant \nwill evaluate financing options and determine an appropriate borrower for the subsequent ADB \nloan (Government as a borrower for onlending to EVN or EVN as a borrower with a sovereign \nguarantee)  for  the  Vinh  Tan  3  Project.  The  consultants  will  also  provide  assistance  as \nnecessary  to  the  Power  Engineering  Consulting  Company  2  in  preparing  the  detailed \nengineering designs and bidding documents.  \n \n16.  To ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s social safeguard policies in relation to involuntary \nresettlement, indigenous, ethnic minorities, and gender issues, the TA will review the social \nimpact  studies  undertaken  by  the  Power  Engineering  Consulting  Company  2  and  the \nGuangdong Electric Design Institute to identify the likely social impacts of the proposed project. \nThe consultants will include these impacts, along with remedial measures, in the resettlement \nplan. Public consultations will be carried out during the TA. \n \n17.  In accordance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and Environmental Assessment \nGuidelines  (2003),  the  consultants  will  conduct  an  environmental  impact  assessment  and \nprepare  a  summary  environmental  impact  assessment,  including  an  environmental \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2006.

In addition, the impacts associated with port, coal handling facilities, ash \npond, water supply system and access road during construction and plant operation, will be \nassessed. The summary initial poverty and social analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1.176 million. The Government has requested \nthat ADB provide $1.0 million. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special \nFund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government will provide counterpart staff, office \nspace and facilities, technical feasibility studies, environmental reports, and support services. \nAppendix 3 presents detailed cost estimates and the financing plan. The Government has been \ninformed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  The executing agency will be EVN and the implementing agency will be the Thermal \nPower Project Management Unit 3. EVN will be responsible for overall implementation of the \nPPTA,  including  grant  administration,  review  and  approval  of  the  consultants\u2019  reports  and \npayment requests, and communication with ADB. The Thermal Power Project Management Unit \n3 will be responsible for day-to-day TA implementation activities, supervision of consultants, and \nprovision of counterpart staff and office space.  \n \n20.  The TA will be implemented by a consulting firm that will provide about 26 person\u2013\nmonths of international and 24 person-months of national consulting services. The consultants \nwill be engaged by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended  from  time  to  time).  The  TA  will  use  fixed  budget  selection  method  given  the \nimportance of the project and the need for a high-profile consultant team for this relatively \ncomplex project. The request for proposals will include a matrix of consultant skills required for \nthe project so that time and personnel inputs can be defined accurately. The PPTA will be \nimplemented over a period of 8 months commencing in February 2008 and ending in October \n2008. The outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 4. \n \n21.  The consultants will organize three consultation meetings on environmental, social, and \nresettlement issues in Vinh Tan District, Binh Thuan Province, during implementation of the \nPPTA.  Estimates  indicate  that  about  200  participants  from  Government  agencies,  non-\ngovernment organizations, and concerned communities will attend the consultation meetings. \n \n22.  The final TA report will be disseminated to the public in accordance with ADB Public \nCommunications  Policy  (2005).  All  computer  models,  databases,  and  training  materials \ndeveloped by the consultants during the TA will be transferred to EVN upon completion of the \nTA and thereafter will remain the property of the Government.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Preparing the Vinh Tan 3 Thermal Power Generation \nProject, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \nMeeting the growing  Increased electricity  Government\u2019s Power  Ongoing government and \ndemand for electricity in  demand met by  Development Master  private sector commitment \nSouth Viet Nam  efficiently performing  Plan  and resources to invest in \n  generation facilities by     new power generation \n2012  EVN\u2019s Annual Report    \n    Availability of coal supply  \n  Feedback from the   \nMinistry of Industry and   \nTrade, local Governments, \nprivate sector partners  \n \nADB Review Missions \n \nOutcome      Assumption \nProject design agreed  Memorandum of  Consultant\u2019s final report  The Government adopts the \nby the Borrower and  Understanding    recommendations for the \nADB  between ADB and the    design and implementation \n  Government on the  Back-to-office report of  of the Project \n  project design upon  fact-finding mission for the   \ncompletion of the TA  project   \n   \nOutputs      Assumption \n1.

POVERTY ISSUES \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \nThe Country Strategy and Program 2006\u20132009 stresses the importance of maintaining sustainable, equitable economic \ngrowth momentum to achieve further reductions in poverty. Viet Nam\u2019s success in bringing down the share of the \npopulation below the poverty line from 70% in 1990 to 27% in 2005 is based on rapid but equitable economic growth \nrecorded during this period. The availability of cheap and reliable electricity generated from indigenous sources is an \nessential requirement for sustainable economic growth and for maintaining the economy\u2019s international competitiveness \nas Viet Nam makes the transition from an economy based on agriculture to one based on industry. Viet Nam is also \nemphasizing the creation of nonfarm employment opportunities for the rural population through the provision of rural \ninfrastructure, including access to electricity. Viet Nam has achieved considerable success in rural electrification, with \nmore than 90% of rural communes and more than 80% of households having access to electricity. With access to \nelectricity, the rural poor, who account for the majority of the country\u2019s poor, will enjoy better education, communication, \nhealth, comfort, convenience, and productivity. In particular, the development of livelihood projects is critical for the \nsustainability of electrification projects, as livelihood projects will improve the income-generation capacity of rural \nhouseholds so they can pay for the electricity. \nB. Targeting Classification          \n1.  Select the targeting classification of the Project: \n \n General Intervention    Individual or Household (TI-H);  Geographic (TI-G);  Non-Income MDGs (TI-M1, M2, \netc.) \n \n2. Explain the basis for the targeting classification:  \n \nThe PPTA will prepare an investment project to build a thermal power plant to meet the demand for electricity, thereby \npromoting economic growth in the country. \nC.  Poverty Analysis \n1. If the project is classified as TI-H, or if it is policy-based, what type of poverty impact analysis is needed?  \n         \nNot applicable. \n2. What resources are allocated in the PPTA/due diligence? \n \nThe PPTA consultants will conduct a poverty assessment of the project, including a distribution analysis of project \noutputs, and identify the proportion of benefits accruing to the poor. \n \n3. If GI, is there any opportunity for pro-poor design (e.g., social inclusion subcomponents, cross subsidy, pro-poor \ngovernance, and pro-poor growth)? \n \nThe incidence of poverty and the provincial government\u2019s policies and strategies for poverty in Vinh Tan District, where \nthe proposed project is located, will be analyzed and appropriate measures will be included in the project design to \naugment and complement government initiatives for poverty reduction in the province. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  9 \nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \nA. Initial Social Analysis \nBased on existing information: \n1.  Who are the potential primary beneficiaries of the project? How do the poor and the socially excluded benefit from \nthe project? \n \nElectricity is an input to most economic processes, and thus is an important ingredient of economic development, which \nis essential for poverty alleviation.  \n \n2.  What are the potential needs of beneficiaries in relation to the proposed project? \n \nThe proposed project will help provide an adequate and reliable electricity supply to satisfy the forecast electricity \ndemand, including accelerated rural electrification initiatives. \n \n3.  What are the potential constraints in accessing the proposed benefits and services, and how will the project address \nthem? \n \nThe rural poor should be able to afford the electricity tariff. A discount will be provided to low consumption, poor, \nresidential customers. \nB. Consultation and Participation \n1. Indicate the potential initial stakeholders. \n \nThe potential stakeholders include residents in the vicinity of the project site, community-based organizations, and local \ngovernment organizations. \n \n2.
