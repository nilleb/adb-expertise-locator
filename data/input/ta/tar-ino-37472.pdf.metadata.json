The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  provided  substantial  support  to  the \nGovernment of Indonesia during the last 30 years in developing all subsectors of education. \nSince the early 1990s, ADB has progressively increased support to basic education. To assist \nthe  Government  with  the  initial  steps  of  decentralizing  education  management,  TA  3701-\nSupport  for  Decentralized  Education  Management  (SDEM)  was  approved  in  August  2001. \nBuilding on SDEM and lessons learned from other interventions, the Government requested \nADB to continue its support for decentralized education management and focus on new tasks \nthat have emerged during the first 3 years of implementing decentralization. In response, ADB \nincluded an advisory technical assistance (TA) called SDEM II in the Country Strategy and \nProgram Update (CSPU) for 2004, with an allocation of $500,000.1 At the end of 2003, ADB \nagreed with the Ministry of National Education (MONE) on core outputs and activities for SDEM \nII, subject to confirmation by a multiagency-funded Education Sector Review (ESR)2 that was \nfinalized in February 2004. It has been proposed that funds from the European Union (EU) will \nsubstantially expand the scope of the TA at a later stage.3 The TA Framework is attached as \nAppendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The education system is the largest public service provider in Indonesia, employing over \ntwo million teachers and encompassing 202,000 schools and over 38 million students at the \nprimary and junior secondary levels. During the 1980s and early 1990s, Indonesia achieved \nsignificant  improvements  of  its  human  development  indicators,  including  the  educational \nindicators.  However,  the  Asian  financial  crisis  of  1997/98  had  a  negative  impact  and  the \neducational indicators faltered after the crisis, but have recovered during the last few years. The \nnet enrollment rate (NER) at the primary level increased from 60% in 1971 to 92.1% in 1998 \nand further to 92.7% in 2002. The NER at the junior secondary level increased from 47% in \n1993 to 57.1% in 1998, and further to 61.7% in 2002 (data from ESR).   \n \n3.  Cross-regional analyses of education expenditures in Indonesia are not readily available. \nHowever, studies by ADB and the World Bank in a selected number of provinces confirm that \npublic education resources are not distributed equitably across regions. There is a wide cross-\ndistrict variation in per student expenditures and per school expenditures, and student-teacher \nratios that generally favor urban areas and put poor rural areas at a severe disadvantage. \nRedressing inequity in access and quality remains a major challenge for the decentralized \neducation system.  \n \n4.  The multiagency-supported ESR of 2004 analyzed the decentralized basic education \nsystem in Indonesia and concludes that the quality of education remains one of the country\u2019s \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 5 December 2003. \n2  MONE. 2004. Education in Indonesia: Managing the Transition to Decentralization. Education Sector Review. \nJakarta. \n3  The EU through the European Commission indicated its interest to substantially increase the scope of the \npreviously agreed core activities of  SDEM II. Intensive consultations between MONE, European Commission, and \nADB led to an extended and expanded design for a cofinanced TA project. The proposed EU contribution \namounting to $5 million will be provided on an untied grant basis and will be administered by ADB. This would \nextend the duration of the TA to 3 years. However, the EU funds are likely to be available only after March 2005. \nGiven the scope of the evolving policy and capacity building agenda, as analyzed and documented by the ESR, the \nGovernment has reiterated its request for the ADB project to start immediately to meet the urgent demands of \ndecentralized education management, while EU funds may be added at a later stage. Implementation schedule \nand the proposed financing plan would need to be adjusted accordingly.  \n ", " 2  \nmajor challenges. It confirms that enrollment expansion in Indonesia closed the gap between \nmale and female students and across income groups at the primary level. Income equity and \ngender gaps remain an issue at the junior secondary and senior secondary levels. Government \nrecognition of these challenges is reflected in the national education goals of (i) achieving 100% \nenrollment  up  to  the  junior  secondary  level  (grade  9),  (ii)  ensuring  that  the  poor  and  the \ndisadvantaged have full and equal access to education, and (iii) providing education that is of \nacceptable quality and that is relevant to the economy and society. The ADB country strategy \nfor Indonesia recognizes these objectives and states that improving the quality of and access to \neducation  for  the  poor  will  require  improved  targeting,  increased  funding,  and  increased \nefficiency.  \n \n5.  Relevant  decentralization  laws4  are  ambiguous  regarding  fiscal,  political  and \nadministrative responsibilities of sub-national governments. The key challenge for the national \nGovernment is to ensure adequate allocation of resources by regional governments to the \ndevolved parts of the education sector. MONE has identified nine obligatory functions and a \nlarge  number  of  minimum  service  standards  (MSS)  in  education  for  ensuring  quality  of \neducation  (Appendix  2).  However,  they  need  to  be  prioritized  and  operationalized  for \nimplementation. On financing of education, the new Education Law stipulates that a minimum of \n20% of the central budget and 20% of the districts\u2019 budgets, both exclusive of salaries, must be \nallocated to education. However, the building blocks of fiscal federalism, like related expenditure \nand revenue assignments and intergovernmental transfers have not been fully developed. \n \n6.  The ESR has identified a policy reform agenda for making decentralization work for \neducation  by  (i)  establishing  clear  roles,  appropriate  governance  structures,  and  financing \narrangements at all levels of Government; (ii) reforming the structure and processes of the \nnational ministry to meet its new roles; (iii) increasing the education resource envelope for the \ndistrict and city governments; and (iv) having provincial and district/city governments prepare \nand  implement  a  multi-year  regional  investment  and  resource  plan.  Decentralization,  if \nimplemented effectively, offers a major opportunity for education delivery to be more efficient \nand responsive as regional governments have better information about regional preferences; \nthus  decentralization  should  enhance  allocative  efficiency.  It  is  necessary  to  put  in  place \neffective accountability mechanisms and management systems, which are backed by adequate \nresources.  \n \n7.  A lack of proper preparation for implementing decentralized education in Indonesia has \nmeant that clear strategic direction and decisions on building blocks for decentralization are still \npending. The Unit for Facilitation of Decentralized Education (UFDP), as a focal point for \ncoordinating policy issues and supporting the high-level interministerial steering committee5 at \nMONE, is best placed to undertake this policy reform agenda provided it can establish an open \ndialogue with all Directorate Generals of MONE, an area where it encountered difficulties in the \npast. There is a need to assist MONE in formulating effective strategies and addressing the \nfollowing issues: (i) governance and management of education at all levels, (ii) finalization of \nMSS and quality assurance, (iii) transparency in resource allocation and utilization, and (iv) \nmonitoring and performance-based evaluation. Governance, transparency, and accountability \nwithin the broader context of decentralized administration will remain issues high on the agenda \nfor many years to come.  \n                                                \n4 Law 20/2003 on the National Education System and the Regional Government Law 22/1999. \n5 The steering committee is chaired by the secretary general and members include directors general of MONE; \ndirector general of budget, Ministry of Finance; director general of regional autonomy, Ministry of Home Affairs; and \ndeputy in charge of social welfare of BAPPENAS.   ", "      3\n8.  Even though external assistance to the education sector in Indonesia is substantial and \nhas been increasing over the years, support to MONE on strategic issues has not received \nmuch attention so far, except through SDEM. SDEM provided support to MONE for (i) initial \nestablishment and building capacity of the UFDP at MONE; (ii) initial preparatory work on \ndrafting  of  obligatory  functions  and  MSS  in  education;  (iii)  monitoring  the  decentralization \nprocess and its effects; and (iv) establishing a foundation for district-level education sector \nplanning  and  management  and  preparing  recommendations  to  streamline  district-level \neducation management. The proposed activities of SDEM II will build on lessons learned of \nSDEM and support the national Government\u2019s efforts to ensure delivery of effective, equitable, \nand  efficient  education  services  within  the  framework  of  a  well-designed  decentralized \neducation system. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n9.  The goal of the TA is to support the establishment of an equitable, effective, and efficient \neducation  system,  which  is  based  on  well-functioning  decentralized  service  provision  and  \ncontributes to a better-educated population. The TA will support UFDP in consolidating the work \nand outputs of SDEM and enable the unit to formulate policies and support decision-making of \nthe interministerial steering committee on key policy reform issues. The purpose of the TA is to \nassist and improve the capacity of MONE to implement strategic changes required for an \nequitable, effective, and efficient decentralized education system.  \n \n10.  The outputs of the TA will consist of (i) concise MSS, related technical standards and \ndetailed implementation guidelines and performance indicators for education tested in selected \ndistricts,; (ii) a master plan for implementation giving a clear and concise definition of roles and \nadministrative  functions  of  different  levels  of  Government,  including  appropriate  regulatory \nframeworks6; (iii) recommendations regarding multi-year regional investment and resource plans \nthat are consistent with new roles, functions, standards, and regulations; (iv) a basic design of \neducation management information and operation system in support of MONE\u2019s new roles and \nfunctions (including regulatory and quality assurance functions); and (v) a plan for strengthening \nthe monitoring, evaluation, and internal control mechanisms of MONE.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  The TA activities will build on outputs of SDEM and support decentralized education \nmanagement  in  terms  of  delivering  effective,  equitable,  and  efficient  education  services. \nActivities at the national level will be implemented by MONE and instituted in coordination with \nthe National Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS), Ministry of Regional Affairs (MORA), \nMinistry of Finance (MOF), and Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA). The TA will work with a \nselected number of case districts.7 The TA will examine ongoing and proposed interventions \nand programs in the education sector and ensure integration of lessons and experiences in \npolicy  formulation,  based  on  extensive  consultations  with  stakeholders  through  seminars, \nworkshops, and focus groups, both at national and district levels. \n                                                \n6  The regulatory framework in education is defined in broad terms and includes legislation as well as the overall \nenvironment in which the various stakeholders (central, provincial, and district governments; schools; parents; \nteachers; and students) operate.   \n7  Sample districts will be selected based on criteria like (i) networks of districts that have benefited from multiple \ninterventions and demonstrated progress in transparency and accountability, (ii) responsiveness to the education \nreform agenda, and (iii) geographical focus of ADB. \n ", " 4  \n \n12.  In support of MONE, the TA will (i) review and consolidate existing work on MSS and \nobligatory functions, taking into account ESR findings and prepare a draft policy document \noutlining  concise  MSS  in  education,  related  technical  standards,  and  objectively  verifiable \nindicators; (ii) develop an overall framework for implementing and monitoring MSS and related \nstandards at various levels, including at the school level; (iii) review the existing assignment of \ngovernance, managerial, and financing functions at various levels of Government and identify \nappropriate assignments for an improved decentralized education system; (iv) prepare a master \nplan that clarifies roles and functions of Government at all levels, specifying human resource \nand financial implications and requirements; (v) assess resource requirements at all levels and \nidentify mechanisms for the flow of funds to districts and schools and prepare recommendations \nfor a multi-year regional investment and resource plan; (vi) prepare a draft proposal outlining the \nbasic  design  of  a  feasible  education  management  information  system  (EMIS),  including  a \nbenefit monitoring and evaluation (BME) system as an integral part of the EMIS; (vii) establish \nan interactive web site at MONE to facilitate stakeholder dialogue on policies, management, and \ngovernance  issues;  and  (viii)  review  current  monitoring,  evaluation,  and  internal  control \nfunctions of MONE and identify adjustments required by new roles and functions demanded by \ndecentralization. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $625,000 equivalent of which $223,000 is in \nforeign exchange and $402,000 equivalent is in local currency. The Government has requested \nADB to finance $500,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost and $277,000 \nequivalent in local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA \nfunding program. ADB will finance domestic and international consulting services, production of \nreports, policy papers, organization of workshops, studies, field testing, and administrative and \nsupport services. The Government will finance the remaining $125,000 equivalent of local \ncurrency costs by providing counterpart facilities. A detailed financing plan and cost estimates \nare in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  The TA is expected to begin in November 2004, and will be implemented over a period \nof 18 months until April 2006. The first month will constitute an inception phase to prepare and \nconfirm detailed implementation plans, including staffing, budgets and a clear description of \ndeliverables  and  performance  milestones.  The  inception  phase  will  also  determine  the \nsample/case districts. ADB will engage a team of one international consultant and four domestic \nexperts  to  provide  10  person-months  and  52  person-months,  respectively,  of  consulting \nservices.  ADB  will  select  a  local  or  international  consulting  firm  in  accordance  with  the \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging \ndomestic consultants. The quality and cost-based selection method and simplified technical \nproposal format will be used in selecting the consulting firm. The outline terms of reference for \nconsultants are in Appendix 4. All procurement under the TA will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement. The consulting firm will be responsible for procuring equipment. \nThe equipment purchased previously under SDEM will be used for activities under the proposed \nTA. \n \n15.  Implementation arrangements will be similar to those under the SDEM. MONE will be \nthe Executing Agency for the TA and will charge UFDP with implementation under the overall \nsupervision of MONE\u2019s secretary general. The steering committee as established under the ", "      5\nSDEM,  chaired  by  the  secretary  general  of  MONE  and  with  representatives  from  MONE, \nBAPPENAS, MOF, MORA and MOHA, and the State Ministry of Administrative Reforms, will \nmeet quarterly, consider major outputs, guide the implementation of the TA, and ensure intra- \nand inter-ministerial consultation and policy coordination. Participation of key stakeholders will \nbe facilitated through workshops, meetings, and existing mechanisms at various levels.  \n \n16.  MONE will appoint a project manager in the UFDP who will be responsible for the daily \nmanagement of the TA. The project manager will report to a project director, who will be the \nsecretary  of  the  steering  committee.  The  project  manager  will  also  be  responsible  for  (i) \ncoordinating with project managers in selected districts, (ii) networking with other projects and \norganizations, and (iii) working closely with domestic and international consultants and ensuring \nthat the team is available for project activities as scheduled. MONE will provide the necessary \ncounterpart facilities and will facilitate the consultants\u2019 liaison with district and local governments \nand with other relevant agencies. Following a detailed schedule for delivery of outputs, the \nconsultancy firm will submit for approval by MONE and ADB (i) an inception report within one \nmonth of TA implementation, giving a detailed timetable for the assignment and delivery of \noutputs, (para. 10) and a work plan of the team over the project period of 18 months; (ii) an \ninterim report, within six months of the start of services, documenting the status of progress and \nproviding draft reports on the outputs as per the agreed schedule; (iii) a midterm report after 10 \nmonths; (iv) a draft final report after 16 months, documenting the achievements and impact of \nthe TA against deliverables as well as draft policy papers/reports on each of the outputs; and (v) \na comprehensive final report after 17 months of TA implementation after incorporating the \ncomments of ADB and Government on the draft final report. All reports must be submitted in \nEnglish, with a summary of at least five pages in Bahasa Indonesia. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of  Indonesia for  Support  to  Decentralized  Education  Management  II,  and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", " \n6\n \n \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \nA\n  p\np\n        e\nn\n
