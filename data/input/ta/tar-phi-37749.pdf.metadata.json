The Government of the Philippines has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nfor technical assistance (TA) to prepare the Second Agrarian Reform Communities Project \n(ARCP II). An ADB Mission from 2 June to 5 July 2004 reached understandings with the \nGovernment on the objectives, scope and components, cost estimates and financing plan, and \nimplementation arrangements for the TA. The TA is included in ADB\u2019s country assistance \nprogram for the Philippines.1 A preliminary project framework for the TA is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.   ISSUES \n \n2.  In the Philippines, poverty is mainly a rural phenomenon. With poverty incidence over \n40% in rural areas, and nearly 75% of the total poor living in rural areas, combating poverty and \ninequity draws immediate attention to the rural population, who depend for their income and \nlivelihood  on  agriculture.  The  poorest  are  landless  rural  workers  and  small  farmers.  The \nGovernment has recognized that an important cause of poverty and underdevelopment is how \nland is used and controlled, and that asset reform is key for improving agricultural productivity. \nThe Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP), adopted in June 1988, aims to address \nthe inequitable access to land and other productive resources and ultimately promote agrarian \nreform  beneficiaries'  (ARBs\u2019)  welfare  (Appendix  2).  By  providing  farmers  with  land  tenure, \nbuilding social capital, providing access to basic rural infrastructure, and training farmers in \nagribusiness and rural enterprises, CARP helps agrarian reform communities (ARCs), which \nhave among the lowest incomes and living standards, overcome poverty. \n \n3.  In  the last decade  the  Government  made  substantial  progress in  implementing  the \nCARP, particularly by supporting infrastructure and services, land tenure improvement, and \ninstitutional  strengthening,  with  focus  on  the  ARCs  for  integrated  development  and  farm \nsystems improvement  through projects implemented principally by the Department of Agrarian \nReform (DAR). DAR has mobilized foreign technical and capital assistance from multilateral \norganizations such as ADB, European Union, International Fund for Agricultural Development, \nUnited Nations Development Programme, and World Bank; and bilateral funders such as the \ngovernments of Belgium, Canada, Italy, Japan, Sweden, and United States to implement the \nseries of ARCPs throughout the country. Despite this extensive support, only 62% of all CARP \nmunicipalities, 50% of all CARP barangays, 54% of all ARCs, and half of all ARBs have \nbenefited from foreign assistance projects. Given the Government's limited resources, many \nARCs  have  not  been  supported  yet,  and  many  ARBs\u2019  needs  have,  therefore,  yet  to  be \naddressed. \n \n4.  Impact  of  the  Agrarian  Reform  Communities  Project.  DAR  is  implementing  the \nARCP,2 which aims at reducing poverty in about 165 ARCs in 35 eligible provinces, out of the \ntotal 1,646 ARCs nationwide, through provision of (i) rural infrastructure; (ii) land survey and \ntitling; (iii) development support services for agricultural enterprises; and (iv) capacity-building \nfor DAR, local government units (LGUs), and ARC organizations. The Project emphasizes a \ndemand-driven approach, local good governance, and commitment by beneficiaries through a \nprocess of participatory needs assessment at the barangay level.  \n \n5.  The ARCP has contributed significantly to enhancing the income and living conditions of \nARBs,  and  to  improve  peace  and  order,  particularly  in  the  south.  Comprehensive  impact \n                                  \n \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 6 July 2004. \n2  ADB. 1998. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nRepublic of the Philippines for the Agrarian Reform Communities Project. Manila. (Loan No. 1667-PHI: Agrarian \nReform Communities Project, for $93 million, approved on 18 December 1998, and a completion date of July \n2005). ", "2    \nassessment studies conducted by DAR in 2003 showed that the CARP has improved rural living \nstandards  and  income  by  developing  rural  communities  and  providing  access  to  basic \ninfrastructure.3 However, land distribution has been relatively slow. While most of the targeted \npublic  land  has  been  distributed,  transfer  of  private  land  has  been  hampered  by  several \nproblems, including the refusal of owners to part with their lands and the lack of documents to \nprove ownership. The ARCP is a rural development project that targets communities that have \nalready benefited from the transfer of land. Therefore, although the broader issue of land \ndistribution and its problems are of concern for the overall success of the CARP, the ARCP has \nbeen progressing satisfactorily, notwithstanding delays in transferring land. \n \n6.  Lessons Learned. The ARCP will be completed in December 2005. Its second phase \nwill enable sustaining the momentum gained and optimize the impact of agrarian reforms. \nDrawing on the ARCP\u2019s success, three lessons and recommendations can guide the design of \nthe  second  phase  to  maximize  its  impact  and  sustainability.4  First,  ARCP  development \nassistance comes in the form of multicomponent packages, which include land survey and \ntitling,  rural  infrastructure,  livelihood  development,  support  services,  and  institutional \ndevelopment. Livelihood support provided to ARCs in the form of social capital and livelihood \ndevelopment  has  proved  important  to  ensure that  ARBs  can  fully  avail  themselves  of  the \nopportunities provided by land ownership and improved rural infrastructure, and translate them \ninto  reduced  poverty.  Under  its  development  support  component,  the  ARCP  has  financed \nagriculture, rural enterprise, community and institutional development, and credit.  \n \n7.  However, effectiveness of agriculture and rural enterprise development is limited when \nsupport and training are not adequately adapted to specific local needs, or enough attention is \nnot paid to post-training adoption by ARBs of new technologies and skills acquired. Livelihood \nsupport  has  also  shown  to  be  often  unsustainable  unless  assisted  community  based \norganizations (CBOs) have reached a maturity level that allows them to access on their own \ncredit sources and markets for their livelihood products. Microcredit extended by the Land Bank \nof  Philippines  has  not  been  always  available  to  the  extent  requested  by  ARBs  and  their \norganizations. Increased attention will, therefore, need to be paid to building CBOs\u2019 capacity to \na level of sustainable maturity; providing livelihood and agriculture support responding to local \nneeds and demand; and maximizing outreach of microfinance services in ARCs and facilitating \naccess by ARBs to microcredit from diversified sources. \n \n8.  Second, the ARCP has been targeting widely dispersed ARCs in a number of provinces, \nleading  to  higher  costs  and  administrative  difficulties  in  managing  and  supervising  project \nactivities and reduced development impact. To address this, DAR has in the last year developed \nthe concept of agrarian reform zones (ARZs), and initiated a planning strategy of partnering with \nseveral adjacent LGUs to provide development support and management services to ARZs, \nwhich are now referred to as Kapit-Bisig Laban sa Kahirapan  or Linked Arms against Poverty \n(KALAHI) ARZs. The KALAHI ARZ concept aims at supporting the KALAHI national antipoverty \nprogram.  \n \n9.  The  DAR-KALAHI  ARZ  development  strategy  is  an  interlocal  and  integrated \ndevelopment concept in implementing agrarian reform, aiming at the convergence of support \nservices from various agencies and LGUs, and the expansion of outreach and coverage of \nassistance to additional ARCs and non-ARC barangays. DAR provincial offices will promote the \nclustering of ARCs in adjacent municipalities to form an ARZ. Integrated socioeconomic profiles \nare prepared with LGU and community participation, which become the basis for the ARZ \ndevelopment  plan.  The  DAR-KALAHI  ARZ  development  will  facilitate  a  geographic \n                                  \n \n3  Reyes, Celia A. 2003. Impact of Agrarian Reform on Poverty, Vol. 7 of The Comprehensive Agrarian Reform \nImpact Assessment Studies, Vols.  1\u20138. Manila: Department of Agrarian Reform.  \n4  More information on the impact assessment of the CARP and ARCP is in Appendix 2. ", "  3\nconcentration  of  interventions  and  an  up-scaling  of  coverage,  resulting  in  greater  regional \nimpact.  \n \n10.  Third, LGUs\u2019 technical and fiscal capacities need to be improved. A more targeted \ngeographic coverage, focused on ARZs, will allow the Project to significantly increase LGUs\u2019 \ncapacities and to have strategic regional impact. A strategic regional context could also justify \nthe  provision  of  sufficient  national  counterpart  funding  to  achieve  equity  in  providing \ninfrastructure  to  low-income  provinces  with  high  poverty  incidence  and  to  balance  fiscal \ninsufficiencies in poor LGUs. \n \n11.  Finally, the institutional arrangements for implementation and monitoring of the ARCP \nneed to be rationalized. The existing arrangements provide for an excessive bureaucratic and \nlayered approach to administration, involving a number of offices both at central and local \ngovernment levels and resulting in high administration cost. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.   Purpose and Output \n \n12.  The  objective  of  the  ARCP  II  is  to  reduce  poverty  by  continuing  support  to  the \nGovernment strategy for equitable distribution of rural wealth (agriculture land) and provision of \nrural infrastructure and income through ARC and KALAHI ARZ development. The purpose of \nthe TA is to help the Government prepare an investment project as a follow-up to the ARCP. \n \n13.  The components of the ARCP II are expected to be similar to those of ARCP: (i) land \nsurveying and titling; (ii) provision of rural infrastructure; (iii) provision of development support \nservices;  and  (iv)  project  management  and  capacity  building  of  DAR,  LGUs,  and  ARC \norganizations. In each component, the TA will identify critically needed specific interventions in \nconsultation  with  communities.  The  TA  will  also  identify  measures  to  ensure  maximum \neffectiveness of the assistance provided for development support services and institutional \ndevelopment. \n \n14.  The selection of the ARCP II area will take into account the ARCP\u2019s achievements and \nsupport for the CARP from externally funded projects, as well as compliance of ARCs with \nselection criteria for assistance. However, in designing the Project, the lessons learned (see \nparas. 6-11) will be fully incorporated. In addition to ensuring sustainability of the ARCP sites, \nARCP  II  geographic  coverage  is  expected  to  cover  new  ARCs  not  yet  assisted  by  the \nGovernment or foreign programs. The TA will formulate, in consultation with DAR, criteria for \nsite  selection,  which  identify  (i)  ARCP  sites  where  ARCs  have  reached  a  high  level  of \norganizational  and  developmental  sustainability  that  would  justify  their  mainstreaming  into \nDAR\u2019s regular program, and which, therefore, may be excluded from special external funding \nunder the ARCP II; (ii) ARCP sites that need additional support under ARCP II to ensure \nsustainability of the gains achieved; and (iii) new ARCs demonstrating inter-LGU cooperation \nand  interagency  convergence  that  will  result  in  efficient  management  and  cost-effective \nprovision of interlocal project components. In line with Government priorities and ADB strategy, \nselection of project sites will be confined to only a few provinces in the southern Philippines. \n \n15.  The TA will assess opportunities for the ARCP II to adopt the ARZ geographic focus \nconcept developed by DAR, to maximize the development impact of project interventions and \nminimize management costs and difficulties arising from wide geographical dispersal of large \nproject sites. If such approach is found appropriate, the TA will help DAR develop the criteria to \nprioritize and select ARZs to be assisted by the ARCP II, to cover the ARCs falling under the \nselection criteria. The TA will then determine the intervention package for each ARZ, which, \nwhen added up, will constitute the total project investment. In identifying ARCs and ARZs for \n ", "4    \ninclusion under the ARCP II, the TA will take into account management considerations, as well \nas  local  fiscal,  governance  and  technical  capacities,  and  recommend  ways  to  overcome \npossible constraints. \n \nB.   Methodology and Key Activities \n \n16.  The TA will start with a rapid review of the impact and lessons learned from the ARCP \nand other projects in support of the CARP under other foreign assistance, as well as a review of \npolicies and legal issuances, programs, and sectoral analyses. The review will include the \nvalidation of the cost-effectiveness and efficiency of the ARC approach including on how to \nsimplify and rationalize the advisory and oversight mechanism at LGU level, and assessment of \nthe proposed methodology of clustering ARCs in ARZs. The review will examine strategies and \nactivities carried out under the regular program of DAR and of the other line agencies involved \nin  CARP  implementation,  to  bring  out  best  practices.  Governance  and  implementation \nweaknesses, including coordination inefficiencies, will be examined, building on the lessons of \nthe ARCP and other externally aided projects, to strengthen good governance safeguards. As \npart of the review, the TA will study the delays encountered by the land survey and titling \nprocess, to recommend institutional arrangements between DAR, Department of Environment \nand Natural Resources (DENR), and other stakeholders, to streamline the process. \n \n17.  Following the review, the TA will select ARZs that are clusters of ARCs within two or \nmore adjacent municipalities. The TA team will agree with DAR and ADB on criteria for selection \nof project sites. On the basis of these criteria, the TA will determine the final potential sites, \ncompiling their socioeconomic profiles and mapping the areas. A preliminary estimate is that the \ntotal ARCP II sites will have a combined population of some 30,000 ARB households (around \n150,000-180,000  people).  Agrarian  reform  will  be  implemented  as  a  comprehensive \ndevelopment  approach,  rather  than  a  sectoral  concern,  in  consonance  with  the  spirit  of \nconvergence of economic and social development support to ARBs.  \n \n18.  The  TA  will  then  firm  up  the  methodologies  for  specific  component  planning  and \nevaluation, taking into consideration the local context. After the desk review and consultation \nwith national program personnel of DAR, DENR, Department of Agriculture (DA), and oversight \nagencies, the TA will conduct a series of regional and local consultations and dialogues to \ngenerate feedback on ARCP implementation. Social aspects such as gender issues, women\u2019s \nand indigenous people\u2019s participation in the benefits of ARCP, and its poverty reduction impact \nwill  be  analyzed,  and  measures  to  maximize  social  benefits  as  well  as  good  governance \nsafeguards will be built into the ARCP II design.  \n \n19.  Site-specific component planning will be the basis for determining the cost of developing \neach site. Planning will be participatory and require the conduct of workshops attended by \nrepresentatives from DAR local offices, LGUs, DA, DENR, and National Irrigation Administration \n(NIA); ARC leaders; and other stakeholders. The identified components will be subjected to \nfeasibility analysis using indicators of financial and economic viability and of environmental and \nsocial soundness. The feasibility analysis will include an assessment of the technical and fiscal \ncapacity  of  targeted  LGUs  and  of  their  absorption  capacity  on  the  basis  of  local  equity \ncontribution requirements.  \n \n20.  The TA will prepare the project implementation schedule and arrangements, set up fund-\nflow mechanisms (through the newly created Municipal Finance Corporation or other viable \noptions), set up and staff the project management office, and design management systems, \nespecially  the  planning  system  and  monitoring  and  evaluation  system  (including  project \nperformance targets and indicators). \n ", "  5\nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n21.   The total cost of the TA is estimated at $358,000 equivalent, of which $95,000 is the \nforeign exchange cost and $263,000 equivalent is the local currency cost. ADB will finance \n$250,000 equivalent, consisting of $95,000 in foreign exchange costs and $155,000 equivalent \nof the local currency costs. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding \nprogram. The Government will finance the remaining $108,000 equivalent of the local currency \ncosts, and has assured the availability of counterpart services, facilities, and funds by the TA\u2019s \nexpected commencement date. The Government has been advised that TA approval does not \ncommit ADB to financing any ensuing project. Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.   Implementation Arrangements \n \n22.  DAR will be the TA\u2019s Executing Agency and, through its Project Development and \nManagement Service and Foreign-Assisted Projects Office (FAPsO), will be responsible for \noverall TA administration and implementation. FAPsO will provide counterpart staff and office \nfacilities  for  TA  administration,  and  other  administrative  support  services.  Interagency \ncoordination will be ensured by a TA steering committee to be chaired by the undersecretary for \nsupport services, which will meet periodically to review TA progress and reports, guide the \nconsultants,  and  select  target  project  sites.  The  committee  will  include  representatives  of  \nrelevant  Government  agencies  such  as  the  Department  of  Finance,  National  Economic \nDevelopment Authority, Department of Interior and Local Government, Department of Budget \nand Management, DA, DENR, NIA, and Land Bank of the Philippines.  \n \n23.  The TA will be implemented over 6 months by a team of one international (4 person-\nmonths)  and  seven  domestic  consultants  (21  person-months).  Their  expertise  will  include \nagrarian  reform  and  social  development,  rural  development  planning,  rural  infrastructure, \nagribusiness and rural enterprise development, microfinance, law, and environmental impact \nassessment and mitigation. A domestic consulting firm will be engaged by ADB in accordance \nwith the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by Asian Development Bank and its Borrowers \nusing quality- and cost-based selection. The outline terms of reference of the consultants are in \nAppendix 4. Biodata technical proposals will be required from short-listed consulting firms. \n \n24.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  in  a  fully  participatory  manner,  and  will  seek  active \ninvolvement  and  inputs  from  LGUs,  microfinance  institutions,  CBOs,  ARBs,  and  other \nstakeholders through participatory workshops and focus group discussions. ADB project staff \nwill closely monitor the TA implementation through inception, midterm, and final review missions \nand regular communications. A summary initial social and poverty analysis is in Appendix 5. \n \n25.  Two weeks after the work starts, the consultant team leader will submit an inception \nreport for discussion at a tripartite meeting with the Government and ADB. Within 3 months after \nthe work starts, the team will submit an interim report containing the preliminary findings and \nrecommendations, to be presented and discussed by the consultants at a workshop involving \nhigh-level  representatives  of  the  Government,  LGUs,  and  ADB.  A  draft  final  report,  to  be \ndiscussed at the final tripartite meeting, will be submitted five months after the beginning of the \nTA  study.  The  team  leader  will  submit  the  final  report  incorporating  the  comments  of  the \nGovernment and ADB within one month of the date of the final tripartite meeting. \n \nIV.   THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n26.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $250,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the Philippines for preparing the Agrarian Reform Communities Project II, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nPRELIMINARY PROJECT FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Indicators  Monitoring  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary \nand Target  Mechanisms  Risks \nGoal        \n       \nReduce poverty and  Raise household income  PPMS reports, benefit \nimprove socioeconomic  by 35% in targeted  M&E reports \nstatus of ARBs in  ARCs   \nselected ARCs    Project completion \n  Increase farm and  reports \nnonfarm employment by   \n40% in targeted ARCs  Impact assessments, \n  family income and \nexpenditure surveys \n \nNational statistics \n \nPurpose        \n       \nIncrease sustainable  Crop yields increased by     \nagricultural production  15%  PPMS reports, benefit  Natural disasters \nand income in targeted    M&E reports   \nARCs  Livestock production    LGU counterpart \n  increased by 20%  Project progress reports  constraints \nProvide agribusiness       \njobs   High-value crops  Impact assessments  Unfavorable farm-gate \n  adopted by 50% of    prices  \nImprove access to  beneficiaries  National statistics   \npotable water      Negative impact of new \n  Potable water made  Income classification and  technologies \nImprove access to  accessible to 100  revenue collection of   \ninfrastructure  barangays  targeted municipalities  Poor maintenance of \n      infrastructure \nProvide sustainable  Transport and handling  Project completion report   \nsupport services  cost reduced by 30%  CBO and cooperative \n    failure \nEstablish sustainable  All targeted ARCs have   \nand effective CBOs   active CBOs  Sustainable ARC \n    development and \n  At least 75% of LGUs  mainstreaming of ARCs \n  meet their counterpart  into regular LGU and \n  requirements for rural  Government programs \n   infrastructure   \nmaintenance    \n \nARB = agrarian reform beneficiary; ARC = agrarian reform community; CBO = community-based organization; LGU = \nlocal government unit; M&E = monitoring and evaluation; PPMS = project performance  monitoring system. \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  7 \nTHE COMPREHENSIVE AGRARIAN REFORM PROGRAM \n \n1.  The challenge of combating poverty and inequity in the Philippines draws immediate \nattention to some two thirds of the population who live in the rural areas and who depend for \ntheir income and livelihood on agriculture. The poorest are the landless rural workers and small \ncultivators, while the less poor are rice and livestock farmers; people with access to land, farm-\nto-market roads, marketing, and small irrigation schemes; and those living in areas with good \naccess  to  social  and  municipal  services  provided  by  local  government  units  (LGUs).  The \nGovernment has recognized that an important cause of poverty and underdevelopment is how \nland is used and controlled. Legislative efforts to change this situation go back to 1936, with the \nmost recent effort being the 1988 Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP). \n \n2.  Agrarian  reform  is  considered  key  to  rural  development  because  of  its  envisioned \nsocioeconomic impact on poor farmers through increased productive assets and empowerment. \nDespite their slow growth, agrarian reform programs have moved from mere land redistribution \nfrom the 1930s to the 1970s, to the comprehensive program that brought about not only the \ndistribution of private and public lands but also the convergence of physical, economic, social, \ntechnology, and institutional support to agrarian reform beneficiaries (ARBs). \n \n3.  The Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR), the lead agency implementing the CARP, \nadopted and introduced in 1993 an area-focused community-based strategy to delineate and \norganize agrarian reform communities (ARCs) in key provinces. An ARC is a barangay or a \ncluster of barangays where at least 50% of households are headed by an ARB. As of March \n2004, the country had 1,606 ARCs (1,646 ARCs, including those in the Autonomous Region of \nMuslim Mindanao) in 1,163 municipalities, with 1.04 million ARBs.  \n \n4.  The ARC development strategy has eight major components: (i) ensuring land tenure \nsecurity; (ii) building community organizations; (iii) providing basic infrastructure; (iv) enhancing \nagricultural productivity; (v) building agro-industries; (vi) enhancing women\u2019s participation; (vii) \nintegrating environmental concerns; and (viii) providing social services and facilities. \n \n5.  Comprehensive impact assessment studies conducted by DAR in 2003 showed that the \nCARP helped raise rural living standards and level of development. The CARP transformed land \nownership by increasing farm size, and effecting a shift from predominantly share tenancy to full \nownership by farmers. Living standards increased significantly more in rice and corn lands in \nARCs than in non-ARCs. During 1990-2000, average overall annual incomes of ARBs almost \ndoubled  from  P49,594  to  P98,653.  Farm  income  increased  on  average  from  P36,246  to \nP67,761  (+87%),  while  annual  off-farm  income  decreased  slightly  from  P7,555  to  P6,878. \nNonfarm income also increased significantly, from P28,780 to P49,419 (+72%).1  \n \n6.  Access  roads  have  significantly  improved  mobility  of  farm  products  and  people. \nConcrete farm-to-market roads are generally in good condition and maintained by LGUs. Water \nsupply is available in most ARC barangays. Social and institutional strengthening services have \nalso made an impact. Most ARCs have community-based organizations (CBOs), although these \nare sometimes beset by management problems. The CARP has improved peace and order. \nGender  is  one  area  that  shows  discernible  progress:  many  women  have  assumed  local \nleadership roles such as membership in barangay councils, or serve as barangay and CBO \n                                  \n \n1  Reyes, Celia A. 2003.

However, land distribution was relatively slow. In 1972-1987, 755,172 hectares (ha) \nwere distributed to 440,239 farmers, who increased to 898,420 in the following 5 years. In 1992-\n1998, 2.6 million has. of mainly public lands were distributed to 182,762 farmers. By 2000 a total \nof 4.7 million has. had been distributed. In 2001-2003, 313,778 additional has were distributed \nto 215,636 farmers. For 2004-2008, the Government targets redistribution of the remaining \n800,000 has at an estimated 200,000 has. per year. \n \n8.  In the last decade substantial foreign assistance has been provided for the CARP, \nparticularly to support infrastructure and services, land tenure improvement, and institutional \nstrengthening. Focus has been on the ARCs, where planning and implementation for integrated \ndevelopment and farm systems improvement have been the guiding principles.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the Philippines: \nThe fundamental goal of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP) is to equitably distribute \naccess to land and other productive resources and, ultimately, promote the people\u2019s welfare. In the \nPhilippines, poverty is mainly a rural phenomenon. With a poverty incidence of more than 40% in rural \nareas, where nearly 75% of all the poor live, combating poverty and inequity draws immediate attention to \nthe rural population, who depend for their income and livelihood on agriculture. The poorest are landless \nrural workers and small cultivators. The Government recognizes that an important cause of poverty and \nunderdevelopment  is  how  land  is  used  and  controlled,  and  that  asset  reform  is  key  for  improving \nagricultural productivity. By providing land tenure, building social capital, providing access to basic rural \ninfrastructure, and training people in agribusiness and rural enterprises, the CARP helps agrarian reform \nbeneficiaries (ARBs), who are among the poorest of the country\u2019s population, overcome poverty and \nimprove their welfare.  \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Proposed Poverty Classification: Core Poverty Intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nThe project preparatory technical assistance will assess the requirements of ARBs and other families living \nin agrarian reform communities (ARCs) for financial and technical assistance in the Agrarian Reform \nCommunities Project II (ARCP II) interventions, particularly in building social capital and community \norganizations, training in agribusiness and rural enterprises, developing rural infrastructure, and analyzing \nthe feasibility of proposed strategies and activities in poverty reduction. The TA will ensure that the project \nframework  will  allow  for  interventions  and  monitoring  mechanisms  to  improve  human  development, \nincluding income, nutrition, and general social welfare. A poverty analysis will be undertaken to estimate \nthe  expected  impact  of  the  Project  on  poor  ARCs,  other  stakeholders  (including  nongovernment \norganizations,  community-based  organizations  [CBOs],  cooperatives,  and  other  local  groups),  and \ngovernment agencies, particularly provincial and municipal governments. The analysis will evaluate the \ndistribution of project benefits and impact across various income groups, and estimate the distribution of \nproject effects on the poor, as outlined in ADB\u2019s Handbook for Integrating Poverty Impact Assessment in \nthe Economic Analysis of Projects. \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?   Yes   No  \nDuring the review of ongoing and completed agrarian reform projects, the consultants will identify and \nconsult with all stakeholders and determine the characteristics, roles, and functions of the target groups. In \nparticular, the consultants will undertake a participatory rapid appraisal or similar approaches to gather \nbackground information on the ARBs and other communities living in ARCs, meet with key individuals and \nlocal groups, and engage in dialogue to identify rural development needs and constraints. The outcome of \nthe analysis will form the basis for proposing selection criteria for inclusion of project sites, and for \nidentifying project interventions. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?   Yes    No \nThe TA will be implemented in a fully participatory manner. The consultants will organize and conduct a \nseries of stakeholder workshops and focus group discussions at the national and project site level during \nTA implementation to solicit stakeholder inputs to assess the situation, impact of the ARCP, and design of \nproject strategy and specific activities for incorporation in the ARCP II. \n \n ", "16  Appendix 5 \nD.
