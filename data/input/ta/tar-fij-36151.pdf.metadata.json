INTRODUCTION \n1.  In March 2002, an Asian Development Bank (ADB) Fact-Finding Mission visited the Fiji \nIslands to review the possible role of ADB in assisting the rehabilitation of the sugar industry. \nThe Mission held in-depth discussions with relevant agencies including the Sugar Commission \nof Fiji (SCF);1 the offices of the Sugar Tribunal; the Fiji Sugar Corporation (FSC); and the \nMinistry of Agriculture, Sugar and Land Settlement (MASLS). Extensive discussions were also \nheld with workers, farmers, and representatives of indigenous Fijian groups. Field visits were \nmade to sugar-growing areas. \n \n2.  The Mission found that the sugar sector is on the verge of a profound transformation. \nThe industry is facing a major restructuring and a possible significant reduction in size as it \nadapts to a pending loss of preferential tariffs within 6 years. At the same time, significant \nchanges are taking place in landholding patterns as longstanding smallholder leases expire, \nlandowners reclaim their lands, and former sugarcane growers are forced to find other sources \nof income. In addition, the processing infrastructure of FSC\u2013\u2013the mainly Government-owned \nprocessing corporation\u2013\u2013is seriously degraded, and the company is in poor financial straits. \nProposals have been floated for the restructuring of the industry but have, so far, failed to gain \nsupport  among  all  stakeholders.  Indeed,  it  became  clear  to  the  Mission  that  there  is \nconsiderable lack of unanimity among stakeholders in the sugar industry, particularly regarding \npotential solutions to imminent challenges.  \n \n3.  Given the sugar industry\u2019s major contribution to the country\u2019s gross domestic product \n(GDP), foreign exchange earnings, and employment, its sudden collapse would have serious \neconomic and social consequences. Yet under current conditions, such a collapse is entirely \npossible. To help resolve one of the major challenges facing the sector, the Government has \nrequested technical assistance (TA) to prepare a project that would support both alternative \nlivelihoods  for  displaced  sugar  cultivators,  and  also  provide  assistance  to  indigenous \nlandowning groups wishing to make productive use of their newly reclaimed land.2 There is also \na need to assist the Government in resolving the problems of the sugar industry as a whole so \nthat a viable industry can emerge. Even if a large number of former sugar cultivators eventually \nfind alternative activities, a revitalized, smaller, more efficient sugar industry would still have the \npotential to provide employment and contribute significantly to the country\u2019s economic well-\nbeing. \n \n4.  However, a viable sugar industry is unlikely to rise from the current chaos unless all \nstakeholders agree on what needs to be done. To aid the Government in bringing all parties \ntogether to resolve the multitude of complex, interrelated issues facing the sector and to ensure \nthe continued existence of the industry, the Government has requested support from ADB \nthrough advisory TA designed to help the Government and all stakeholders prepare an action \nplan for the rational and measured restructuring of the industry.  \n \n5.  To  initiate  this  support,  the  Mission  and  government  representatives  cooperated  in \ndesigning a TA for Intermediation of Sugar Sector Restructuring.3 The proposal was discussed \nat a wrap-up meeting in Suva on 21 March 2002 and received the support of all stakeholders. \nAs a result, the Government requested support from ADB for the implementation of the TA. The \n                                                 \n1  A neutral oversight body whose role is to provide a forum for all stakeholders. \n2  PPTA for Alternative Livelihoods is under preparation. \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in March 2002. ", "2 \nTA framework is shown in Appendix 1. A summary initial poverty and social analysis is shown in \nAppendix 2. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n6.  Sugar production is a key sector of the Fiji Islands' economy. Sugar production covers \n50% of the country\u2019s agricultural land, directly employs 13% of the workforce, indirectly provides \nemployment for a similar percentage, accounts for about 35% of agricultural GDP and 8% of \ntotal national GDP, is the country\u2019s second biggest earner of foreign exchange (around US$125 \nmillion per annum compared with tourism at US$250 million per annum), and generates some \n30% of total exports.4 In addition, unlike other export-oriented industries in the country, the \ndomestic value of production is high. Almost all factors of production are indigenous, unlike the \ngarment sector, for example, which depends heavily upon imported raw materials, as does the \ntourism industry to a lesser extent. \n \n7.  The sugar sector is currently facing a crisis, a situation that could have a major negative \neffect on both macroeconomic and social stability and the poverty status of the entire country. \nFSC, the mainly Government-owned entity that owns the country\u2019s four sugar mills, is insolvent \nand requires an immediate injection of more than US$100 million simply to continue operating. \nThe country is facing the prospect of selling sugar at world market prices within 6 years and has \nmade no serious effort towards reducing production costs to a level that would allow the industry \nto survive the predicted drop in prices to one third of present levels. To the contrary, lacking \nappropriate  incentives,  field  production  efficiency  has  been  dropping  consistently,  with \nincreasingly  negative  consequences  on  the  quality  of  both  the  sugarcane  and  the  sugar \nproduced. Foreign buyers have warned that they will find alternative supplies unless sugar \nquality from the Fiji Islands improves. Many sugarcane farms are too small and fragmented to \nproduce anything but a subsistence level income. Finally, as a result of the expiration of leases \nof indigenous land, large numbers of experienced farmers are leaving the sugar areas, while \nindigenous Fijian landowners, some of whom are keen to grow sugar, are taking over leases but \nlack the capital and the appropriate skills for effective and efficient production.  \n \n8.  Efforts have been made in the past to improve the efficiency of the industry and instill \nboth productive practices and a measure of rationalization. For example, a Sugar Industry \nStrategic Plan produced in 1997 sets out a valid road map for reform that appeared to be \nagreeable to all parties.5 However, so far, partly because of the lack of alternative livelihoods for \nsmall farmers who might be displaced during the restructuring, most recommendations of FSC \nhave not been implemented. These matter will now be addressed in the alternative livelihood \nproject preparatory TA. More recently, FSC has worked with industry stakeholders to produce a \ndocument entitled The Fiji Sugar Industry\u2014A Way Forward recommending a different (and \nmore radical) approach to sector restructuring.6 The document has received a measure of \nacceptance  within  the  industry,  but  it  requires  refinement,  as  it  has  not  been  embraced \n                                                 \n4\n  Reserve Bank of Fiji Quarterly Review. December 2001. Suva. \n5\n  Groups, entities, and organizations concerned with the sugar sector in Fiji include, inter alia, the 23,000 families of \nsugarcane growers themselves, the landowning individuals and clans who lease land to the growers, the Sugar \nCane Growers Council, FSC (responsible for sugarcane transport and processing), the 3,000 workers at FSC, the \nFiji Sugar Marketing Corporation, a variety of unions and political parties representing groups involved in the sugar \nsector in one way or another (including the two main political parties) and a range of government agencies \nincluding MASLS, the Native Land Trust Board, the Ministry of Commerce, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. \n6  This would involve splitting up FSC into four independent companies operating under separate accounts, pooling \nall the sugarcane land under one master lease to each company, and subleasing to farmers. There are major \nconcerns with this proposal. ", "    3 \nunanimously. Some stakeholders remain hesitant. Clearly, assistance is required to help finalize \na proposal based on the best of the 1997 and 2001 plans that can become the basis for a \nrestructuring action plan. In the meantime, with the changes in land tenure currently taking \nplace, the problems of the industry seem to be multiplying. \n \n9.  The challenges facing the country under these circumstances are manifold and appear \nto be beyond the capacity of national decision makers to resolve alone, as evidenced by the \nfailure of the two most recent plans for the industry to achieve widespread acceptance. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n10.  The sugar industry in the Fiji Islands is embroiled in a complex web of problems ranging \nfrom land tenure issues to poor quality of the end product to an impending collapse in prices. \nMoreover, there seems to be no consensus among the stakeholders and parties involved \nregarding the means (or even the desirability) of restructuring the industry to ensure its survival. \nNonetheless, the survival of the industry, or a controlled and measured withdrawal from it, is \ncrucial to the economic well-being of at least one quarter of the population, and indirectly to the \nentire economy. The social and economic consequences of a sudden collapse (which is a real \npossibility if nothing is done) could be disastrous. \n \n11.  All parties agree that there is a need for outside intermediation to assist in advising \nstakeholders  on  the  situation  within  the  industry,  bringing  them  together  for  constructive \ndiscussions on possible remedies, and assisting in finalizing an agreement on the ultimate form \nthat restructuring should take. In view of ADB\u2019s close development partnership with the Fiji \nIslands, the Government has requested its assistance in this intermediation process. \n \n12.  The purpose of the TA is thus to provide a neutral forum for stakeholder discussions and \nconsultations on the restructuring of the sugar industry, along with the expertise to provide \nsound technical advice to the restructuring process. The intent is to initiate fully informed \nconsultation and negotiation among all parties while managing the disputes that color at least \nsome  of  the  interaction  between  and  within  the  various  stakeholder  groups.  While  rapidly \nachieving consensus with all parties may not be possible, it is conceivable to achieve enough \ncommon understanding to proceed with a medium-term consensus-building exercise as to how \nthe sugar industry could best be structured in the future, who will participate in it, and how they \nwill empowered to participate. \n \n13.  The assistance to be provided will consist of a team of experts skilled in intermediation \nwith  expertise  that  includes  a  knowledge  of  agricultural  production  systems  in  developing \ncountries and their socioeconomic structure, a knowledge of the worldwide sugar industry, and \na sound knowledge of the history and culture of the Fiji Islands. \n \n14.  The team\u2019s activities will be focused on  \n(i)  raising the knowledge base of all concerned so that all parties fully understand \nthe  current  tenuous  situation  of  the  sugar  industry  and  the  implications  of \ninadequate action;  \n(ii)  initiating substantive discussions among and between stakeholders based on a \nfull  knowledge  of  the  status  of  the  industry  as  it  now  exists,  and  the \nconsequences of lack of action; and  ", "4 \n(iii)  assisting in the preparation of a time-based action plan for sector restructuring, \nincluding  an  ongoing  process  of  consensus  building  for  remaining  areas  of \ndisagreement. \n \n15.  The result of a successful intermediation exercise will, at the least, be improved political \nstability as stakeholders come to realize the gravity of the situation facing the industry. They will \nrecognize the need for collaboration to either do something about it, or to work constructively to \nfind alternative sources of livelihood for large sections of the population. Optimistically, the \noutput of the TA would be a fully agreed upon action plan for the restructuring and salvation of \nthe industry as a major employer and source of income and foreign exchange for the country, \nalthough agreement to continue the process of consensus building is a more realistic outcome. \n \nB.   Methodology and Key Activities \n \n16.  TA implementation will take place in three stages: (i) knowledge upgrading, (ii) the \nformulation of a restructuring concept and base model, and (iii) the preparation of a restructuring \naction plan (as described in para. 19). \n \n17.  With the possible exception of the officers of SCF, most actors in the sugar sector in the \nFiji Islands seem to lack a comprehensive knowledge of the problems besetting the sector. \nMoreover, few understand the Fiji Islands sugar industry within the context of the global sugar \nindustry. Thus, to arrive at an informed consensus among stakeholders will require a step-by-\nstep increase in the knowledge of the Fiji Islands sugar sector and its status within a worldwide \ncontext. The first step will be for the consulting team to raise its own knowledge level through \nliterature reviews; interaction within the team; and interviews with all the actors, including the \nindustry\u2019s customers. The next step will entail in-depth discussions and workshops with all \nstakeholders to elicit their concerns and priorities and to gradually ensure that they are all fully \nbriefed on the real status of the industry. The third step will comprise informing all groups of \nstakeholders and the general public of the concerns and priorities of other groups. \n \n18.  Only when all stakeholders have approached a similar knowledge level will it be possible \nto initiate informed discussions among them on a mutually agreeable concept for a restructured \nindustry. Since it is a point of common awareness, the starting points for discussion will be the \ncurrent restructuring proposal put forward by FSC and the best elements of the 1997 plan. This \nwill involve a critical review of the current proposal by key actors, and a decision as to whether \nthese can serve as a base model or will require modification. The international knowledge and \nexposure  of  the  consultant  team  will  prove  useful  in  helping  the  stakeholders  make  this \ndecision.  If  a  reformulation  of  the  proposal  is  deemed  necessary,  the  team  will  assist  in \nidentifying the key weaknesses and developing a revised concept. \n \n19.  Upon agreement among the stakeholders on a model for restructuring, the team will \nassist with the detailed design and implementation scheduling for a restructuring action plan and \nidentify  activities  to  be  undertaken,  as  well  as  the  agencies  or  entities  responsible  for \nimplementation. The team will help identify any institutional changes that need to take place to \nensure the efficient functioning of the industry under the new model. Finally, the team will help \nto pinpoint any policies, regulations, or legislation that need revision, reform, or abolition to \nensure success of the restructuring, and will suggest appropriate revisions. ", "    5 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n20.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at US$940,000 equivalent, including US$585,000 in \nforeign exchange and US$355,000 equivalent in local currency cost. The Government has \nrequested  ADB  to  finance  US$660,000,  covering  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  and \nUS$75,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed by ADB on a grant \nbasis from the ADB-funded TA Program. The Government will finance the balance of the local \ncurrency cost. A summary of the TA costs is provided in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n21.  The Executing Agency for the TA will be SCF, which will provide advice, guidance, and \ndirection to the consulting team during the implementation period. The TA will be implemented \nover a 6-month period, commencing around July 2002 and ending in December 2002. An \ninception report will be prepared within the first month and will form the basis of an initial \ntripartite  meeting  among  ADB,  the  Government,  and  the  consultants.  Subsequent  monthly \nreports will be submitted to the Government, SCF, and ADB. Tripartite meetings will be held \nduring the second month, the fourth month, and towards the end of the sixth month. Due to the \nnature of the TA, ADB will undertake close monitoring of its implementation. The TA will require \nthe services of 26 person-months of international (18 person-months) and domestic (8 person-\nmonths) consultants. The expertise could include  \n \n(i)  a mediator/team leader experienced in agricultural development,  \n(ii)  a sugar industry specialist,  \n(iii)  a land tenure specialist,  \n(iv)  an agro-industry corporate management specialist,  \n(v)  a legal specialist, and  \n(vi)  a public relations specialist.  \n \n22.  Provision has also been made for the recruitment of additional specialized international \nexpertise, the need for which may be identified during TA implementation. This may be in the \nfields  of  sugar  cane  transport,  factory  rehabilitation,  public  information,  and/or  market \nnegotiation. To ensure flexibility and the best possible expertise for each position, consultants \nwill be engaged as individuals or as individual consultants from a firm by ADB in accordance \nwith its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for \nthe engagement of domestic consultants. Terms of reference for these experts are provided in \nAppendix 4. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of US$660,000 on a grant basis \nto the Government of the Fiji Islands for Intermediation of Sugar Sector Restructuring, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board.
