INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  Government  of  the  People's  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  requested  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB),  during  the  2006  country  programming  mission,  for  technical \nassistance (TA) for the Enhancement of the Performance Audit Capacity of the China National \nAudit  Office  (CNAO).1 The  Fact-Finding  Mission  visited  Beijing  during  22\u201324  August  2007. \nFollowing  the  discussions,  an  understanding  was  reached  on  the  objectives,  scope,  and \nimplementation arrangement of the TA. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  An important element of the reform agenda  of ADB is mainstreaming managing for \ndevelopment results (MfDR). The 11th Five Year Plan (11FYP) announced by the Government \nin  2006  also  stresses  MfDR.  The  11FYP  includes\u2014for  the  first  time\u2014a  matrix  with  22 \nmonitoring indicators, 8 of them with targets and 14 with benchmarks. Also for the first time, the \nplan contains specific text discussions on the importance of monitoring and evaluation (M&E) \nwork and is explicitly committed to carrying out a mid-course evaluation of the 11FYP, which will \nthen be subject to review by the standing committee of the National People\u2019s Congress. The \ndesign  of  the  M&E  framework  followed  an  internationally  recognized  model  that  includes \nselecting key performance indicators to monitor and sustain the M&E system.  \n \n3.  CNAO is the supreme audit institution in the PRC, established in 1983. CNAO has \ntraditionally  focused  on  compliance  audit  and  financial  audit.  Given  the  recent  increasing \nemphasis on MfDR, CNAO started to introduce the concept of performance audit2 in its work \nprogram and targeted reaching 50% of all projects audited before 2008. Performance audits will \nhelp government better align investments and project implementation with development targets \nand results, thus ensuring that goals under the 11FYP are met satisfactorily.  \n \n4.  The CNAO Department of Foreign Funds Application Audit (DFFAA), established in \n1984,  is  responsible  for  auditing  projects  financed  with  loans  and  grants  provided  by \ninternational organizations and foreign governments. It is required to provide audit certification \nfor projects financed by international institutions including ADB and the World Bank. Since its \nestablishment, DFFAA has provided over 500 audit certificates for foreign-financed projects and \nperformed audits of over 5,000 executing agencies, involving grants and loans totaling more \n                                               \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 15 November 2007. The TA was listed in the ADB TA \nprogram as standby for 2007 and firm for 2008 during the country programming mid-term review in March 2007. \nThe Cooperation Fund in Support of Managing for Development Results, under ADB management, approved \nfunding for the TA in May 2007. The MfDR cooperation fund was established in March 2004 to support the \nintroduction of MfDR approaches in ADB's developing member countries. The Fund\u2014with contributions from \nCanada, Netherlands, and Norway\u2014amounts to $2.9 million. It is a multidonor umbrella facility that allows for \nfurther donor contributions. \n2  Performance audit refers to an examination of a program, function, or operation, or the management systems and \nprocedures, of a governmental or nonprofit entity to assess whether the entity is achieving economy, efficiency, and \neffectiveness in the employment of available resources. The examination is objective and systematic, generally \nusing structured and professionally adopted methodologies. Results and findings are stated in terms of yardsticks \nderived  from  the  entity\u2019s mission,  vision,  values,  or  goals,  or  on metrics  based  on  these.  Many  national \ngovernments  support  professional  or  advisory  bodies  that  publish  standards  and  guides  for  conducting \nperformance audits. Performance audits are often conducted by internal auditors who are employees of the entity \nbeing audited. However, some national governments require agencies, departments, and branches to periodically \nretain outside auditors to conduct them. Although there are separate professional credentials and certifications for \nfinancial auditors, the people that conduct performance audits are often certified public accountants. Findings from \na performance audit can sometimes indicate situations that should be examined by law enforcement investigators. \n ", "2   \nthan $60 billion. Through external assistance provided to CNAO, including assistance from \nADB,3 staff at DFFAA and the audit bureaus of local governments have received training on \ninternational accounting principles and accounting standards, plus financial statement auditing, \nanalysis, and presentation. The high quality of DFFAA audit work has been well recognized by \ninternational organizations. \n \n5.  Institutionally,  foreign-funded  projects  are  audited  by  provincial  audit  bureaus  at  the \ncorresponding  project  sites  under  the  overall  leadership  of  DFFAA, which  provides  regular \nguidance  to  provincial  audit  bureaus  to  bring  them  abreast  of  procedures  adopted  by \ninternational  organizations  including  those  of  ADB  and  the  World  Bank.  Capacity-building \nmeasures include regular training on ADB practices and procedures, sharing experiences, and \nundertaking individual research. \n \n6.  The audits performed by DFFAA have traditionally been largely financial audits and \ncompliance-based audits.4 DFFAA started to conduct performance audits in 2004 to expand the \nscope of audit to cover issues such as the delivery of project objectives, implementation, and \nfund management, as well as environmental impacts, social benefits, and the sustainability of \nprojects. In 2007, DFFAA completed performance audits of a sample of 100 World Bank and \nADB-financed projects.5 The report of this audit exercise was reviewed by the auditor general \nand senior officials of the state council. DFFAA received strong encouragement from the senior \nleadership to continue this work.  \n \n7.  Performance  audit  covers  a  broader  scope  as  compared  with  financial  audits  and \nrequires different techniques and skills as compared with compliance and financial auditors. \nPerformance audit is also a critical part of broader efforts for MfDR. ADB has supported MfDR in \nthe  PRC with  a  series  of  TA  grants  and  regional  activities.  The most recent  TA6 assisted \ngovernment agencies in developing modules of developmental result indicators (i.e., outcome \nand impact) in the results-based M&E system for key projects and training of staff members. \n \n8.  At present, DFFAA has neither critical mass in terms of human resources in the area of \nperformance audit, nor guidelines or manuals to ensure its staff apply a consistent approach to \nperformance audit. Moreover, the knowledge and professional capacity of many auditors fail to \nsatisfy the requirements of performance audit. It is necessary for auditors to know international \nbest  practices  and  learn  advanced  theories,  methodologies,  and  techniques  concerning \nperformance audit. A recently conducted assessment by ADB7 identified CNAO\u2019s need to fully \nunderstand the principle and process, and be able to conduct performance audits to the highest \nprofessional standard, and recommended that ADB assist CNAO in the area of performance \naudit.  A  recently  completed  technical  assistance  performance  evaluation  for  selected  TA \n                                               \n3  ADB. 1991.

Technical Assistance \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China for Strengthening the Government Auditing System. Manila (TA 3103-PRC),  \nassisted the formulation and development of new auditing standard for CNAO. \n4  The financial statements on which DFFAA has to express an audit opinion normally include the balance sheet, \nincome statement, source and application of funds statement, and any other supplementary statements that may \nbe required by the funding agency concerned. The reporting requirements are normally specified in the relevant \nloan agreement. \n5  Twenty-seven projects were financed by ADB, mainly in the sectors of agriculture, manufacturing, energy, \ntransportation, environment, and urban infrastructure.  \n6  ADB. 2005.

", "  3\nprojects in public administration8 recommended that CNAO\u2019s performance audit capacity could \nbe  enhanced  through  collaboration  with  the  program  of  ADB\u2019s  Operations  Evaluation \nDepartment (OED) and its project evaluations in the PRC and the region. \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact of the TA is an improved organizational structure for executing program and \nportfolio management of publicly financed projects.9 The outcome of the TA is mainstreaming \nperformance audits for assessing the impact, efficiency, and effectiveness of publicly financed \nprojects, including foreign-funded projects. CNAO will be the direct beneficiary of the proposed \nTA. Public sector institutions and project sponsors, as well as beneficiaries of public investment \nprojects, are indirect beneficiaries.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will be implemented through a combination of policy advice that draws upon \ninternational  best  practice  and  results-based  institutional  capability-building  programs  for \nDFFAA and CNAO. Specifically, the TA will \n \n(i)  assist the DFFAA staff to draft two books; one will describe performance audit \ntheories  and  best  practices  (PATP)  based  on  experiences  of  developed \ncountries,10 and the second will contain selected case studies of performance \naudit (CSPA) from the PRC. The two books will serve as essential instruments \nand training materials for DFFAA and CNAO auditors and their associates;  \n \n(ii)  develop through targeted training programs11 a core group of auditors who will be \nfamiliar  with  advanced  performance  audit  theories,  methodologies,  and \ntechniques,  to  become  resource  persons  on  performance  audit  capable  of \ntraining other auditors; \n \n(iii)  identify the training needs for mainstreaming performance audit in CNAO and \nhelp  the  core  group  to  develop  a  curriculum  for  performance  audit  training, \naiming at proper implementation of the PATP, and to develop a set of systematic \ntraining approaches on the subject of performance audit; and \n \n(iv)  produce,  as  by-products  of  the  TA  to  disseminate  among  policymakers  and \ngeneral  public  finance  professionals,  a  series  of  high-level  best  practice  and \n                                               \n8  Available: www.adb.org/Documents/TAPER/PRC/TAPER-PA.asp \n9  Results and findings will be compared with targets and benchmarks as identified in 11FYP and with specific \nyardsticks of project sponsors\u2019 mission, vision, values, or goals. As indicated in the 11FYP, most government-\nsponsored projects are geared towards the development of the western region and poverty reduction. The \nproposed TA will directly contribute to the effective implementation of national and subnational poverty-reduction \nand development plans. \n10  The United States Government's audit guidelines (which include performance auditing) and the International \nOrganization of Supreme Audit Institutions performance audit guidelines are generally considered as international \nbest practices. \n11  The first batch of three training sessions are planned, including one for performance audit for environment projects, \none for basic infrastructure, and one for general performance audit theories and practices. On average, 30 people \nwill attend each session. \n ", "4   \ntechnical notes on specific techniques and approaches of performance audit for \nparticular sectors or types of projects.   \n \n11.  The PATP is expected not only to provide theoretic background of performance audit but \nalso to be detailed enough to provide specific technical parameters for performance audit in \nvarious  sectors  such  as  agriculture,  manufacturing,  healthcare,  education,  forestry, \ntransportation, energy, environment, and urban infrastructure, as well as specific treatments for \nrevenue-generating and not-for-profit projects.  \n \n12.  The  training  activities  will  be  a  combination  of  classroom  teaching,  coaching,  and \nlearning  on  the  job,  as  well  as  internships  at  audit  organizations  of  other  countries  with \nadvanced performance audit practices, and possibly in ADB. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $550,000 equivalent. The Government has \nrequested ADB to finance $400,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the \nCooperation Fund in Support of Managing for Development Results12 and administered by ADB. \nThe Government will provide the remaining $150,000 of local currency costs in kind, covering \noffice  accommodation, counterpart staff, transportation, and other related services. Detailed \ncost estimates are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  DFFAA of CNAO will be the Executing Agency (EA). A leading group will be set up \ncomprising senior officials of CNAO to provide overall guidance for project implementation. The \nEA will provide the necessary office space, counterpart staff, transportation, and other services \nto  consultants  and  arrange  appointments  for  the  consultants  with  relevant  agencies  and \norganizations.  \n \n15.  The  TA  will  engage  one  international  and  two  national  consultants  for  a  total  of \n9.5 person-months, including the team leader  and international performance  audit specialist \n(2.5 person-months), national performance audit specialist (3.5 person-months), and national \nsector project evaluation specialist (3.5 person-months). There will be a separate budget to \nengage additional international and national resource persons for specific technical areas during \nTA implementation, as the need arises. The terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix \n3. The consultants will be selected and engaged on an individual basis in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Equipment \nwill be purchased in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from \ntime to time). The advance payment facility can be considered under TA for training, seminars \nand  conferences,  equipment,  and  publications  under  TA,  with  DFFAA  responsible  for \nadministering such payment. \n \n16.  The TA is expected to begin in January 2008 and end in April 2009. The consultants will \nsubmit  (i) inception  reports  3  weeks  after  the  commencement  of  their  services,  (ii) interim \nprogress  reports  every  quarter  during TA  implementation,  (iii)  draft  final  reports  before  the \nconclusion of the contract, and (iv) final reports 2 weeks after incorporating comments from \nDFFAA and ADB. Knowledge products such as high-level best practice and technical notes will \n                                               \n12  Contributors are the Governments of Canada, Netherlands, and Norway.
