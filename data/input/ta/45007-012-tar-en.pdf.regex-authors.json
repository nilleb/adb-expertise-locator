THE ONGOING PROJECT \n \n1.  On 12 December 2013, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved a multitranche \nfinancing  facility  (MFF)  for  the  Ulaanbaatar  Urban  Services  and  Ger  Areas  Development \nInvestment Program,1 comprising three tranches, and with a revised implementation period of 10 \nyears or until 11 December 2023.2 Based on the updated financing plan, the total program cost \nis  $344.2  million,  of  which  $163.7  million  will  be  financed  by  ADB;  $120.2  million  by  the \nMunicipality of Ulaanbaatar (MUB); and up to \u20ac50.0 million ($60.3 million equivalent at the time \nof approval) parallel cofinancing by the European Investment Bank.3 The program's impact is \nimproved living conditions in Ulaanbaatar. Its outcome is a network of livable, competitive, and \ninclusive subcenters in Ulaanbaatar's ger (yurt or traditional tents) areas.4 The program has four \noutputs:  (i)  roads  and  urban  services  are  expanded  within  the  targeted  subcenters  and \nconnectivity between subcenters is improved; (ii) economic and public services in subcenters are \nimproved; (iii) service providers become more efficient; and (iv) institutions and capacity for urban \ndevelopment, program management, and service delivery are strengthened. The framework \nfinancing agreement was signed on 9 December 2013 and ratified by the Parliament of Mongolia \non 23 May 2014.  \n \n2.  Tranche 1 of the MFF program was approved on 17 December 2013, with a revised \nclosing date of 30 June 2021. It supports the city master plan in developing the Selbe and \nBayankhoshuu subcenters with total ADB financing of $53.7 million.5 As of 15 December 2020, \nthe overall implementation progress is at 89.4% against 92.8% of elapsed implementation period. \nThe  overall  contract  award  was  at  $46.8 million  (87.1%)  while  total  disbursement  was  at \n$40.0 million  (74.5%).  Tranche  2  was  approved  on  31 March  2017,  with  closing  date  of \n28 February 2022. It aims to extend the urban infrastructure and social facilities upgrading and \nspatial restructuring to Dambadarjaa and Denjiin subcenters and provide additional investments \nin Selbe and Bayankhoshuu subcenters with total ADB financing of $66.4 million from ADB.6 As \nof 15 December 2020, the overall implementation progress is at 22.6% against 75.5% of elapsed \nimplementation period. The overall contract award was at $19.2 million (28.9%) while total \ndisbursement was at $13.9 million (20.9%). Tranche 3 was approved on 26 June 2020 and is \nexpected to become effective by Q1 2021, with loan closing date of 11 December 2023.7 It will \nextend investments in priority infrastructure, public facilities, and capacity building to develop \nTolgoit and Sharkhad subcenters. There has been no change in outputs of either tranche 1 or \ntranche 2, and their performance is rated on track. \n \n3.  Three  technical  assistance  (TA)  projects  were  approved  by  ADB  to  support  the \nimplementation of the MFF program: (i) Ulaanbaatar Pro-Poor Urban Redevelopment Support \nSystem for Ger Areas, approved in 2017 to pilot information and communication technology tools \nfor ger area redevelopment;8 (ii) Livelihood Support Demonstration in Ger Areas, a small-scale \nTA approved in 2018, to support the poor and vulnerable households adversely affected by \ninvoluntary resettlement under tranche 1 of the MFF program;9 and (iii) Capacity Building for \n \n1  ADB. Mongolia: Ulaanbaatar Urban Services and Ger Areas Development Investment Program.   \n2  On 16 April 2020, the President approved the extension of the MFF availability period from 9 years to 10 years (or \nfrom 31 December 2022 to 11 December 2023) to ensure the timely implementation of tranche 3. \n3  The financing plan was updated during project processing for tranche 3. ADB financing includes $3.7 million grant \nfrom Urban Environmental Infrastructure Fund under the Urban Financing Partnership Facility administered by ADB. \n4  Ger areas refer to the vast and low-density peri-urban areas in Ulaanbaatar. \n5  ADB.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n4.  Micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) play a fundamentally important role \nin economic development and job creation in Mongolia. At the end of 2017, MSMEs comprised \n77% of total registered business entities and generated about 70% employment.11 In light of that, \ntranche 1 of the MFF program focused  on (i) social and economic facilities development, including \nbusiness incubator centers (BICs); and (ii) institutional and capacity development that supports \ncommunity participation and MSMEs development in its overall financing plan. As part of that \nsupport, in January 2020, a preliminary survey among MSMEs was conducted in Bayankhoshuu \nand Selbe subcenters. The survey results showed that demand for financing and capacity building \nwas high among MSMEs\u2014more than 70% of the enterprises required loan financing, 50% aimed \nto expand their businesses, 27% were in need of equipment, and 14% need to improve their \nfinance and accounting knowledge. However, the survey findings indicated limited access to \nfinance for MSMEs. Only 35% of the MSME business owners received bank loans, while 65% \nwere receiving loans with monthly interest rates higher than 3.5% from private lenders, non-\nbanking financial institutions (NBFIs), savings and credit cooperatives (SCCs), or pawnshops. \nStringent collateral requirements and financial illiteracy were identified as the barriers for access \nto finance among MSMEs. Of the enterprises surveyed, 56% reported difficulties in providing \ncollateral for loans, and 40% in presenting their financial report and/or proof of income. \n \n5.   The government has undertaken various measures to improve access to finance for \nMSMEs. For example, a small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) development agency have \nbeen established for the implementation of SME policies, and promoting better targeted and more \ntransparent funding to SMEs. In addition, the government has launched other measures such as \nestablishment of the credit guarantee and employment creation funds to improve MSMEs' access \nto finance, and initiated training programs and advisory services for MSMEs capacity building. \nHowever, it is reported that the benefits of these support measures have not yet effectively \nreached  the  MSMEs  nor  have  these  measures  been  efficient  and  effective  to  MSMEs \ndevelopment.  International  institutions  also  have  worked  closely  with  the  government  and \nprovided support targeting at MSMEs. For example, ADB has recently provided three loans to \nimprove the availability of financing with longer tenor to MSMEs through financial institutions.12  \n  \n6.  Pandemic impacts. The outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has negatively \nimpacted Mongolian businesses, particularly MSMEs. A survey conducted by ADB's East Asia \nDepartment between April and May 2020 among MSMEs in Ulaanbaatar and nine other provinces, \nindicates that COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionally impacted MSMEs in Mongolia compared \nto the larger businesses, with the MSMEs in urban areas having been negatively affected to a \nhigher degree. Smaller and informal businesses face key challenges due to the COVID-19 \n \n10 ADB. Mongolia: Capacity Building for Sustainable Livelihood Support in Ger Areas. \n11 L. Boojoo. 2019. Leveraging SME Finance through Value Chains in the CAREC Landlocked Economies: Case of \nMongolia. ADBI Working Paper Series. No. 1019. Tokyo: Asian Development Bank Institute. \n12 ADB. Mongolia: Senior Loan to Khan Bank for Supporting Micro, Small, and Medium-Sized Enterprises; ADB. \nMongolia: Supporting the Credit Guarantee System for Economic Diversification and Employment Project; and ADB. \nMongolia: Agriculture and Rural Development Project. \n ", "3 \npandemic travel restrictions and lockdowns, including cash shortages, difficulties in making \ninvestment and financing decisions, and difficulties in paying employees, resulting in layoffs.13 \nSince MSMEs generate about 70% of employment in Mongolia, disruption in their businesses can \nlead to losses of income for households relying heavily on wages and personal businesses, \nintensifying  the  impact  of  COVID-19  on  households,  especially  from  poor  and  vulnerable \npopulations. In response, the government has brought forward a series of economic stimulus \nmeasures to accelerate the post COVID-19 recovery, some of which are relevant to MSMEs.14 \n  \n7.  Providing timely support to MSMEs is therefore critical for not only reducing income \ninequality and unemployment, enhancing social stability, and strengthening private sector, but \nalso aligning with the government's initiatives to accelerate the post COVID-19 recovery and \nimprove  social  resilience.  Improving  financial  literacy  of  MSMEs,  providing  information  on \nconcessional financing, and providing equipment for business development and expansion are \nidentified as key, yet low-hanging fruits for MSMEs development. In addition, as the upgrading of \nSelbe  and  Bayankhoshuu  subcenters  under  tranche  1  is  almost  complete,  new  business \nopportunities will be created to attract and accommodate influx of population. With the support \nfrom this transaction TA, MSMEs are expected to quickly seize those emerging opportunities and \nplay a vital role in maintaining a robust function of subcenters by providing services to residents \nand creating economies in the post COVID-19 recovery period. In the long run, this TA is expected \nto make MSMEs adaptive and prepared for the wider transformation and urbanization of ger areas, \nincluding all subcenters under the other tranches of the MFF program, synergizing with existing \nand future urban development work.15  \n \n8.  This TA is not included in the approved country operations business plan for Mongolia, \n2019\u20132021, but it is well aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, which supports the operational priority \non making cities more livable and ADB's country partnership strategy for Mongolia, 2017\u20132020,16 \non catalyzing urban economic growth.17  \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n9.  Output 1: Capacity, needs, and opportunities for micro, small, and medium-sized \nenterprises to access finance assessed. This output will support detailed and focused survey \nof  the  MSMEs  (with  gender  consideration  and  sex-disaggregated  data)  in  the  Selbe  and \nBayankhoshuu subcenters, and collect information on the supply side of available financing in the \nmarket.  The  survey  will  collect  granular  information  on  MSMEs financial  and  non-financial \nconditions and assess their (i) financial capacity (monthly and annual turnover); (ii) access to \nfinancial sources and services from banks, NBFIs, and financial technology (FinTech) companies; \n(iii) capacity to prepare documentation (financial reports, proof of income, project proposal, \nbusiness plan, etc.); (iv) assets and means of business and production, and equipment needs; \n(v) management capacity; and (vi) business mindset. It will also assess the impacts of COVID-19 \non their businesses, needs to adapt to a post-COVID-19 environment, and other data that are \nrequired by different stakeholders.

This output will provide a clear picture of  the financial situation, \naccess to finance, and non-financial issues of the MSMEs and financial institutions operating in \nthe subcenters; and will determine how  financial institutions can better meet the needs of the \nMSMEs and the feasibility of establishing community-established and led financial institutions in \nthe Selbe and Bayankhoshuu subcenters \n10.  Output  2:  Gender-responsive  capacities  and  knowledge  for  micro,  small,  and \nmedium-sized enterprises to access finance enhanced. This output will carry out the following \nactivities: (i) trainings and workshops on collateral (movable and immovable) requirements for \ncommercial banks and non-bank lenders (NBFIs, SCCs, leasing firms, and FinTech companies), \npreparation  of  documentations  on  collateral,  financial  reports  and  proof  of  income,  project \nproposals,  business  plans,  and  other  relevant  trainings;  (ii)  trainings  and  workshops  on \ncommunity-established and led financial institutions for access to loan funding, including good \npractices on governance, structure, and operation of successful community-established and led \nfinancial institutions; (iii) visits to successful community-established and led financial institutions \nin the ger areas for MSME representatives; and (iv) face-to-face mentor-led on-the-job trainings \nin BICs in the subcenters to complement the classroom trainings and workshops conducted in (i) \nand (ii), and will involve trainings where MSME representatives such as business development \ncommittees will be guided and assisted by mentors on how to prepare and compile relevant \ndocumentation and how to run community-established and led financial institutions. An MSME \nsupport office will be established and run by a mentor in each BIC in Selbe and Bayankhoshuu \nsubcenters. The workshops and trainings will be organized taking into consideration the gender \nissues and hardships encountered by women, and will target a minimum of 50% of the participants \nwill be women. The workshops and trainings will also include presentations on (i) how MSMEs \ncan access financing support available under ADB-supported projects (footnote 12) and public \nand private institutions; and (ii) customized international best practices for MSMEs development, \nincluding lessons from ADB's Pacific Private Sector Development Initiative and Supporting \nInternationalization of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises in the Greater Mekong Subregion. \n \n11.  Output 3: Equipment to develop and expand business opportunities for micro, small, \nand medium-sized enterprises provided. This output will primarily target micro and small-sized \nenterprises. The following activities will be conducted: (i) based on survey results from output 1, \nthe consultant and the MFF program management office (PMO) will assess business needs and \ndevelop criteria to select MSMEs to receive equipment, considering factors such as gender \ninclusiveness, vulnerability, competitiveness, and sustainability;18 (ii) based on (i), the consultant \nwill procure equipment for MSMEs business development and expansion; and (iii) the feasibility \nof providing equipment through leasing companies to MSMEs will be assessed using the survey \nresults in output 1, and the feasibility results will provide insights on the market for the leasing \nindustry  and  potential  business  opportunities  for  future  assistance  to  support  MSMEs \ndevelopment. \n \n \n18 ADB will review and approve (i) the selection criteria developed by the consultant and PMO, and (ii) the list of resulting \nMSME beneficiaries. Equipment support will be demand-driven and include equipment and tools to support \nenhancing efficiencies of the MSME operations, such as computers and printers, mechanized welding equipment to \nwelding units, modernized sewing machines to a handicraft business, etc.  \n ", "5 \n12.  Design and monitoring framework. The TA will not result to a change in the design and \nmonitoring framework of the ongoing MFF program and its tranches. The TA will enhance the \nquality of outputs without any change to the targeted results indicators. In particular, it will facilitate \nthe delivery of outputs 2 and 4 under the MFF program.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $310,000, of which $300,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB's Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-others) resources special pool for COVID-\n19 response.
